                     GRANT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY

      SECONDPROGRAMMATIC SUPPORT FORINSTITUTION BUILDING

Recipient:          Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan
ImplementingAgency: Ministryo fFinance (MoF)
Amount:             SDR 55.3 million (US$SO million equivalent)
Terms:              IDAGrant
Objectiveand        The Grant o f SDR 55.3 million (US$SO million equivalent) is the second o f a
Description:        series o f operations aimed at supporting the implementation o f the
                    Government o f Afghanistan's (GOA) medium-term development strategy
                    withinthe context o f a secure environment and a satisfactory macroeconomic
                    framework. The formulation o f Afghanistan's development strategy -
                    initially outlined in the National Development Framework o f April 2002 -
                    was further developed in the 2004 document Securing Afghanistan 's Future.
                    Building on these achievements, the new Government presented the
                    document Accelerating Economic Development at the Afghan Development
                    Forum held in Kabul in April 2005, and i s now preparing an interim
                    Afghanistan Development National Strategy (ANDs), which will become
                    Afghanistan's Poverty Reduction Strategy. The three budgets adopted since
                    2003/04 have sought to translate these strategies into actions.
                    The series o f Programmatic Support for Institution Building (PSIB)
                    operations, o f which the proposed Grant i s the second, provides rolling
                    support to the Government's development strategy with each operation
                    specifying a set o f triggers which, when met, provide the basis for proceeding
                    with the next operation. Since PSIB Iwent to the Board in July 2004,
                    presidential elections have been held and a new Government has been
                    formed. The new Government has demonstrated ownership o f the reform
                    program. Progress has been satisfactory inmost reform areas outlined inthe
                    Project Document for PSIB I.Achievements include a significant
                    improvement in fiduciary standards and a modernization o f the legal
                    framework inthe areas supported by PSIB I.
                    Buildingon these achievements, the overall objective o fthis second operation
                    i s to continue deepening, broadening, and sustaining the reforms underway in
                    the areas o f public administration and fiscal management. These reforms are
                    at the core o f the Government's objective to build an accountable and
                    effective state and are critical for successful poverty reduction.        This
                    operation complements a series o f IDA projects aiming at strengthening
                    public finance management, raising fiduciary standards, and supporting
                    public administration reform, which are preconditions for a growing share o f
                    donors' assistance to be channeled through the budget.
                    The operation also supports the implementation o freforms that lead to a more
                    efficient allocation o f fiscal resources in the areas o f human development
                    (health and education) and private sector development (investment climate,
                    financial sector, and state-owned enterprises). This operation should be seen
                    as complementing separate investment and technical assistance operations in
                    the areas o f human and private sector development, with the set o f operations
                    seehng to achieve the implementation o f comprehensive sectoral reforms.



                                             vii

Disbursement:     The proposed Grant would be released in one tranche upon Grant
                  effectiveness. All performance conditions would be met prior to Board
                  presentation.

Benefits:         The PSIB Grants provide potential benefits that will contribute to economic
                  growth and poverty reduction. First, they strengthen public administration
                  and fiscal management, and support reforms to improve fiduciary standards.
                  Inaddition, IDA'Ssupport to the Government's development strategy inthe
                  form o f PSIBs i s seen as a catalyst for other donors' continuing support. This
                  will reduce the implementation risks o f all projects including this operation,
                  and i s likely to translate into higher levels o f donor assistance through the
                  budget. Second, the PSIB Grants provide resources to the central Government
                  to deepen its reform program, in particular to strengthen its institutional
                  capacity, which will facilitate the implementation o f its programs, including
                  service delivery beyond Kabul.         This will benefit the whole population
                  including the poor, and contribute to mitigate the risk o f a deterioration o f the
                  political and security situations.    Third, the PSIB Grants also support the
                  implementation o f reforms leading to more efficient allocation o f fiscal
                  resources inthe areas o f human development and private sector development,
                  which will reduce poverty.
Risks:            The PSIB Grants have significant country (political,               security, and
                  macroeconomic), fiduciary, and implementation risks. A reversal in the
                  ongoing political stabilization process or a deterioration in the security
                  situation constitute the largest source o f risk for the operations. Inparticular,
                  the Parliamentary election held in September 2005 increases uncertainties.
                  The macroeconomic scenario i s also uncertain since both donor assistance
                  and the response o f the private sector are highly dependent on the political
                  and security situation. The mitigation o f these country risks i s outside the
                  scope o f this project. However, the PSIB Grants will allow the Government
                  to deepen the implementation o f its program beyond Kabul, which will
                  contribute to the nation-building effort and will help mitigate political and
                  security risks.
                  The PSIB Grants also have fiduciary and implementation risks (including
                  weakened ownership and weak capacity to implement the budget and the
                  reform program). However, the proposed operation builds on significant
                  achievements. First,fiduciary standards and budget implementation processes
                  have been significantly improved, partly as a result o f this series o f PSIBs.
                  Second, the Government has established a track record o f policy reform, as
                  evidenced by the implementation o f PSIB Iand the completion o f five
                  reviews under the IMF's Staff-Monitored Program (SMP).
                  To mitigate these risks, prior actions and triggers focus on areas for which the
                  Government, under the leadership o f the MoF, has expressed ownership and
                  has already built a good track record o f reforms. Continued IDA assistance,
                  together with the next operation's triggers, in the areas o f public finance
                  management and public administration, will contribute to raising fiduciary
                  standards and strengthening implementation capacity. Finally, the program
                  design as a series o f operations based on prior actions provides IDA with a
                  possibility to adjust subsequent operations to the economic situation and the
                  pace o f reformimplementation.

                                      I. INTRODUCTION

1.     This document constitutes the Program Document for a proposed Second Programmatic
Support for Institution Building (PSIB 11) to the Islamic Republic o f Afghanistan of SDR 55.3
million (US$SO million equivalent). It i s the second o f a series of PSIBs aimed at supporting the
implementation o f the Government o f Afghanistan's (GOA)medium-term development strategy
within the context o f a secure environment and a satisfactory macroeconomic framework. The
PSIBs are one-tranche operations based on prior actions and provide rolling support to the
Government's development strategy. Each operation specifies a set o f triggers which, when met,
provide the basis for proceeding with the next operation.

2.     Initially outlined in the National Development Framework (NDF) o f April 2002,
Afghanistan's development strategy was further developed in the 2004 document Securing
Afghanistan 's Future presented by the Transitional Islamic State o f Afghanistan to the
international community at the donors' conference held in Berlin in March 2004. Building on
these achievements, the new Government presented the document Accelerating Economic
Development at the Afghan Development Forum held in Kabul in April 2005, and i s currently
developing its InterimAfghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDs),to be presented at an
international conference early in 2006.' The three budgets adopted since 2003/04 have sought to
translate these strategies into actions.

3.     The overall objective o f the PSIBs i s to deepen, broaden, and sustain the reforms underway
inthe areas ofpublic administration and fiscal management, an objective which is at the core of
the Government's goal to buildthe institutions o f an accountable and effective state and i s critical
for poverty reduction to be effective (Box 1). The PSIBs are components o f an overall package
o f operations that aim at building the financial management o f the state, raising fiduciary
standards, and supporting Public Administration Reform (PAR). A series o f investment and
technical support operations constitute the other critical components o f support to these reforms.
By strengthening institutions, the implementation o f these reforms will in turn facilitate more
efficient allocation o f fiscal resources to priority activities inthe areas o f human development and
private sector development. The country assistance strategy related to this operation i s provided
inthe Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) of the World Bank Group for Afghanistan (IDAR-
2003-0022) discussed at the Board inApril 2003.

4.     PSIB Iwent to the Board inJuly 2004. The new Government, formed after the Presidential
elections in October 2004, has demonstrated its ownership o f the reform program through the
continuity in implementing this program. Progress against the triggers outlined in the Program
Document for PSIB Ihas been satisfactory and the proposed operation builds on these
achievements.

 5.    The Program Document i s structured as follows.             Section I1 describes Afghanistan's
 achievements over the last three and a halfyears and future prospects. Section I11presents GOA'S
 development strategy outlining recent achievements, key challenges, and reform strategy in each
reform area, particularly those supported under the PSIBs. Section IV describes the Bank's
 assistance to Afghanistan and coordination with other donors. Section V describes the proposed
 operation including the reform areas to be supported by the Grants, the progress under triggers for
PSIB 11, the prior actions before Board presentation o f PSIB 11, and the triggers for PSIB 111.
 Section VI outlines key parameters for the implementation o f the proposed Grant.

                                    Box 1: Institution Buildingand PSIB

Institution-building is at the core o f the objectives o f the PSIBs. Significant achievements have already
been made under PSIB I,on which the proposed Grant builds. The program has five mainareas o f focus.
First, the PSIBs support improvements in the legal framework. Two prior actions for PSIB Iwere the
drafting o f critical laws inthe budget and procurement areas. Inaddition, PSIB Isupported amendments to
the Income Tax Law. These legal changes have now been gazetted, a prerequisite for implementation.
Three laws, whose gazetting i s a trigger for PSIB 11, are critical for the institutionbuildingagenda:
  Public Expenditure and Financial Management Law, which establishes (i) sound budget preparation
                                                                                     a
framework, with comprehensive and transparent documentation, (ii)             requirements for accounting and
regular reporting inline with international standards, and (iii) an independent review o f the annual financial
statements for presentation to the National Assembly;
  Procurement Law, which establishes (i)transparent and competitive procurement procedures with
contestable mechanisms based on objective and verifiable selection and award criteria and (ii)                the
responsibilities o f government officials involved inprocurement;
  Civil Service Law, which establishes (i) principle o f open competition and merit for all civil service
                                             the
appointments; (ii)     the Independent Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC,
including independent appointment and appeal boards); (iii)         the base for a number o f regulations and
procedures to be developed (including human resource regulations and appointments procedures); and (iv)
the Administrative Reform Secretariat (ARS) as the focal point for public administration reform.
Second, the PSIBs support improvements in budget management processes. On the formulation side,
adoption by Cabinet o f the 2004105 budget was a prior actian for PSIB I.The program also supports the
institutionalization o f the mid-year review as a mechanism to transparently adjust allocations based on
performance and inform the following year's budget. The program also supports the introduction and
gradual refinement o f a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), which includes (i)            a fiscal table with 4-
year projections o f revenues, expenditures, fiscal deficit and sources o f financing, and (ii) description o f
                                                                                                 a
the policy actions which sustain the projections. On the execution side, the program supports a number o f
improvements that have led to an increase in fiduciary standards (cf. trigger o n eligible expenditures).
Third, the PSIBs support improvements in civil service efficiency. Notably, a reform plan has been
approved by an inter-ministerial committee for a number of departments and, under this scheme, more than
 15,000 positions have been placed on an elevated pay scale. Open and merit-based recruitment has started
for these positions and almost 700 merit-based appointments havebeenmade for senior positions.
Fourth, the PSIBs support the development o f a stronger monitoring framework. T w o important triggers
for PSIB I1were the development o f information systems in health and education, both o f which were
created.
Finally, as part o f the IDA program that complements the PSIBs, technical assistance (policy dialogue and
advice, analytical work, training, system investments) has been provided in the areas o f budget
management, public financial management, and public administration, also contributing to build
Government institutions.
The proposed operation builds on these achievements to support further progress to build core institutions.
As the Government's capacity to pass new laws remains limited, the focus shifts to the implementation o f
the recently approved laws so that they achieve expected results (Section 1V.E). Renewed emphasis is also
placed o n the monitoring and evaluation framework (trigger on statistical capacity and a more elaborate
monitoring framework, Annex 4).



  11.      AFGHANISTAN'SDEVELOPMENT: ACHIEVEMENTS, CHALLENGES, AND
                                                PROSPECTS

 A.      Achievements

 6.     The Bonn Political Process. After more than 20 years o f conflict, a new opportunity for
 the peaceful development o f Afghanistan emerged with the fall o f the Taliban regime in late
 2001. The political agreement reached in Bonn in December 2001 provided a road map for the
 creation o f a peaceful and democratic state. The process o f political normalization, known as the
 Bonn process, has made good progress and i s near completion.                        An Afghanistan Interim

                                                        2

Administration was appointed and governed for six months until an Emergency Loya Jirga
(Grand Council of more than a thousand Afghan notables) was convened in Kabul in June 2002
to appoint a new Afghanistan Transitional Administration, headedby President Karzai, to remain
in office for about two years.      On the basis o f broad consultations, a draft Constitution was
submitted to the Constitutional Loya Jirga in mid-December 2003 and Afghanistan's first
Constitution in three decades was ratified on January 26, 2004. After some delay due mainly to
logistical difficulties, presidential elections were held inOctober 2004. The incumbent, President
Karzai, won in the first round. A new Cabinet was formed at the end o f December 2004.
Parliamentary elections were held on September 18, 2005: the Afghan people have elected the
249 members o f the lower house o f the National Assembly (the Wolesi Jirga) and the 420
members o f the 34 Provincial Councils. District elections are scheduled for 2006, which will
complete the Bonn process. The Government and its international partners have initiated a
dialogue on their partnership beyond the BOMprocess.

7.     Refugee Return. Followingthe fall o fthe Taliban, many Afghan refugees, mainly livingin
the neighboring countries o f Pakistan and Iran, began to return to Afghanistan. At the beginning
o f 2002, an estimated 5.9 million Afghans lived outside the country and one million Internally
Displaced Persons (IDPs) lived inside Afghanistan. Over the period o f conflict, it i s estimated
that one inevery three Afghans became a refugee or an IDP. As o f September 2005, the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that 4.2 million Afghans have
returned to their home country, the largest refugee repatriation in history, while within
Afghanistan, an additional 840,000 IDPs have movedback to their areas o f origin.

8.     Security and Rule of Law. Modest progress has been made toward the establishment o f
security and the rule o f law. Achievements include: (i)    formation o f the Afghan National Army
(ANA, with a force size o f over 20,000) and a police force (now staffed by 40,000 police); (ii)
initiation o freforminthe Ministry o f Defense, including administrative restructuring, merit based
recruitment o f executive level staff, drafting o f a National Defence Strategy, and preparation o f a
new National Threat Assessment; (iii)       implementation o f the Disarmament, Demobilization, and
Reintegration (DDR) program which has led to the disarmament and demobilization o f over
60,000 Afghan Military Forces; (iv) formulation o f the National Drug Control Strategy and
creation o f a Ministry o f Counter Narcotics; (v) comprehensive review o f the judicial
infrastructure; (vi) establishment o f the Afghanistan Human Rights Commission which has
prepared several reports on human rights abuses; and (viii) steady progress inde-mining.

9.     Economic Growth. Starting from a dire situation, Afghanistan has achieved respectable
economic growth during the past three years, with the real value o f non-opium Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) increasing by 29 percent in 2002/03, 16 percent in 2003/04, and 8 percent in
2004/05 (Table 1). Economic growth reflects recovery o f agncultural production (especially
wheat) and has been particularly strong in services and construction, which are expanding rapidly
 inurban centers. Lower growth in2004/05 was mostly due to a significant drought and a fragile
 security situation, which hampered investment.        GDP (excluding opium production) reached
US$6.0 billion in2004/05, equivalent to a per-capita GDP o f US$253.

 10. Macroeconomic Stability. The GOAi s maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework as
 evidenced by the successful completion o f five quarterly reviews under the IMF Staff-Monitored
Program (SMP), which was initiated in March 2004 (Annex 2).               Monetary policy has been
restrained, supported by the adherence to strong fiscal discipline and a "no overdraft" rule that
prohibits Central Bank financing o f the deficit. Inflation reached 16 percent in 2004/05 mainly
 due to higher rental rates and petroleum products prices: excluding these two categories, year-on-
 year inflationremainedat 11percent at end-2004/05. The exchange rate remains stable.

14. While the external budget i s financed exclusively from donor grants, the core budget is
financed from four sources: (i)  domestic revenues, which reached US$268 million in 2004/05
(4.5 percent of GDP), a 29 percent increase above 2003/04; (ii)         donor grants, notably the
Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), which finance both ordinary and development
expenditures (US$487 million or 8.2 percent o f GDP); (iii)  external loans, including the proceeds
o f PSIB I,which finance the core budget (US$309 million or 5.2 percent o f GDP); and (iv)
changes in currency deposits at D a Afghanistan Bank (DAB), Afghanistan's central bank. The
debt to GDP ratio remains low at 13 percent, but there i s still some uncertainty on claims
inherited from previous administrations (notably the Soviet-era Russian claims).

15,   Public Finance Management. The Government has achieved significant improvements in
the area o f Public Finance Management (PFM).           Annex 3 summarizes the Government's
performance inthe P F M area. First, with respect to budget preparation, building on the NDF, the
budget has gradually become a policy instrument and i s used to allocate funds to Government's
highest priorities. The Government has maintainedits commitment to budget transparency, and
an increasing number o f reports are publicly available. Second, with respect to budget execution
and fiduciary controls, the Government has implemented a centralized computerized system, the
Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS), to issue checks and record
revenues and expenditures o f the ordinary and development budgets. Parallel improvementshave
been made inthe DAB payment systems. The system o f Treasury Single Account ensures strong
fiduciary controls (including regular sweeping o frevenues to the center and bank reconciliations).
As a result o f these reforms, the Government's performance relative to the fiduciary standards
that ARTF set to reimburse Government expenditures has significantly improved since the first
year o f ARTF's operations. Third, with respect to procurement, the Government has established
a central facility for procurement that has processed more than 200 contracts, with a total value
above US$400 million, usinginternationally accepted standards. Fourth, with respect to external
audit, the 2003/04 financial statements o f ARTF and IDA grants and most Government accounts
have been audited. These achievements have been supported by external assistance, notably
under a series o f three IDA projects (Emergency Public Administration Projects, EPAP Iand
EPAP 11, and Public Administration Capacity Building Project, PACBP), to improve financial
management, public procurement, internal and external audit.          These achievements will be
consolidated by the implementation o f the recently approved Public Finance and Expenditure
Management (PFEM) and Procurement Laws.

 16.  Public Administration. The legacy o f 25 years o f successive wars and civil strife had left
Afghanistan with a defunct administrative apparatus (Box 2). The Government has initiated the
implementation o f its PAR program to strengthen public administration.             An Independent
Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission (IARCSC) was created in June 2003 to
coordinate and manage the PAR. The size o f the civil service has been kept under control. The
implementation o f the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) program, now covering more
than 15,000 positions, allows administrative departments to place staff on an elevated pay scale in
exchange for organizational restructuring and merit-based staffing.          In addition, about 700
appointments for senior civil servants have been made under merit-based procedures.             The
recently approved Civil Service L a w provides the basis for institutionalizing these achievements.

 17.  Human Development. Results have been achieved in education (school enrollment has
increased from 1 million in 1999 to almost 5 million in 2005) and health (outpatient visits have
tripled over the last year and massive vaccination campaigns have reducedpolio cases), reflecting
progress to supply education and health services (teacher recruitment, school rehabilitation,
extension o f the basic package o f health services). Achievements were also made under the three
main social programs: (i)    the National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP), a cash-for-
work program to rehabilitate rural infrastructure, has directly benefited to 1.5 million household
members; (ii)   the National Solidarity Program (NSP), a program o f block grants for community
managed small-scale reconstruction and development projects in rural areas, now covers half the

                                                  5

20,000 Afghan villages; and (iii) Comprehensive Disabled Afghan's Program made transfer
                                       the
payments to around 300,000 disabled people and members o f martyr families. Progress was also
made under micro-finance schemes (Para. 19). The new Constitutionprovides the legal basis for
women to participate in political and economic affairs. There i s also a pension system for civil
servants reaching about 50,000 pensioners.

            Box 2: Public AdministrationReform-Achievements, Challenges, and Strategy

A quarter o f a century o f wars and civil strife had left Afghanistan in2001 with a collapsed administrative
apparatus. Among urgent and daunting problems confronting the transitional Government were the lack o f
basic skills, inadequate management, confused organizations, overlapping functions, and an inherited pay
scale which was unable to attract the needed qualified personnel.
In order to address these problems and start rebuilding administrative capacity, a comprehensive Public
Administration Reform (PAR) program was prepared in 2002. This program, designed during an
emergency phase, was addressing a broad range o f issues (including financial management, machinery o f
government reform, legal framework, and immediate capacity injection).             The Priority Reform and
Restructuring (PRR) scheme was a central element o f this program, with the objective to facilitate the
establishment o f an efficient bureaucracy through merit-based appointment processes, higher salaries, and
adequate restructuring o f key Government departments.
Both the overall PAR program and the PRR have met with implementation problems, delays, and
questions. The coherence and fiscal sustainability o f the PRR asymmetric approach have for instance been
questioned. The number and rate o f appointments through the PRR process (700 senior staff, 3,000 at
lower levels) have fallen short o f expectations. Inretrospect, this first PAR program was very ambitious
given capacity and political constraints. Insufficient attention was devoted to implementation issues, and
the focus on salaries led to underestimate the institutionbuilding dimension.
However, despite recognized shortcomings, t h ~ programhas also been able to lay the basic buildingblocks
                                                   s
for setting up a modem civil service inAfghanistan. Conceptual and implementation weaknesses have now
been properly analyzed. Corrective measures have been adopted. The ad hoc salary structures devised for
PRR will for instance be folded into a comprehensive pay and grading system, which will be consistent
with the medium-term fiscal outlook.         The institution-building and restructuring needs are properly
recognized. The institutions which have been set up to implement the P A R program (the Independent
Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission, the Administrative Reform Secretariat, the
Independent Appointment Board) appear sound; their capacity has much improved and will be further
strengthened. The Civil Service Law, which has recently been gazetted, provides a satisfactory legal
framework.     And finally, the accumulated know-how in an area where there are no established best
practices i s now considerable.
Building on this experience, the Government has prepared a revised PAR strategy for the 2006/2010
period. This strategy will be a key element in the state building strategy prepared in the context o f the
ANDS.
This new strategy seeks to shift the focus away fromprevious asymmetric anddepartment-centeredreforms
to comprehensive reforms involving whole ministries. It comprises five pillars:
 1) An administrative reform pillar including the strengthening o f the central Government machinery, the
reformand restructuring o f ministries and agencies, and the rolling out o f the reform at sub-national level;
2) A salaries and incentives pillar aiming at establishing a small and well paid civil service;
3)   A civil service management pillar aiming at establishing a professional civil service regulated by a
modem framework o f laws, clear procedure manuals, and ethlcal standards;
4) A merit based appointmentpillar requiringtransparent merit-based selection;
5 )  A capacity enhancement pillar including training and skill enhancement, better management oj
international technical assistance, and adequate use o f short term capacity.

 18.   Infrastructure.      Major investments in infrastructure have been made over the last three
years. Telecommunication has rapidly expanded driven by a competitive market and US$200
million inprivate investment. The mobile footprint now covers more than half o f the country's
population. The country has a teledensity o f 2.6 percent (up from 0.1 percent in 2002). In
transport, rehabilitation o f the main highways i s ongoing (including the corridors linking the

                                                         6

country's main cities and key border points).        There are two international airports and 40
domestic airfields. Investments in the power sector have focused on rehabilitation o f damaged
generation capacity for Kabul and Kandahar, the distribution network inKabul, and construction
of transmission lines from existinghydro plants to Kabul.

19.    Financial Sector. Afghanistan's formal financial system has been revived. At the end o f
the conflict, the sector consisted mainly o f a large and dynamic informal market - referred to as
hawala. Since then, new legislation (Central Bank Law and Banhng Law) was adopted to grant
the Central Bank independence and establish the basis for a modem legal framework for a two-
tier banking system. Twelve commercial banks have been licensed. Progress has been made in
rebuilding the DAB as evidenced notably by improvements in the payment system. A vibrant
network o f micro-finance institutions, under the umbrella o f the Micro-Finance Investment
Support Facility for Afghanistan, created in 2003, has been developed and serve more than
140,000 clients in 15 provinces (of which 90 percent are women).

20.    Private Sector Development. Measures have been taken to support the development of a
vibrant private sector. The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency created in2003 i s a one-stop
shop for business registration.    Improvements have been made in the tax system to support
investment and trade. Private sector investment i s tahng place, notably in construction and
telecommunications and mostly inKabul. Private investment has grown from 1percent o f GDP
in2002103 to 4 percent in2004l05.


B.     Challenges andProspects

21.    Despite the impressive economic recovery and the implementation o f a sound development
strategy, the development challenges are enormous and muchremains to be done. The remainder
o f this section outlines a medium-term framework fully consistent with the IMF's SMP, which
covers the period March2004 - September 2006.

22.    Security.   The overall security situation still remains volatile, but does not present a
strategic threat to the Government. The situation inKabul has stabilized. It was uncertain at the
time o f the Presidential election in the fall o f 2004, but this and the September 2005
parliamentary and Provincial Council elections have passed without disruption. Security outside
Kabul offers a mixed picture. It has somewhat deteriorated in the south and east where anti-
Government and narcotics elements are active. In other regions, apart from isolated incidents
sometimes related to criminal activity, the security situation has improved following the
implementation o f DDR. While the capacity o f the ANA has increased, the police and justice
system remains weak, so that lack o f security still hinders private investment, reconstruction, and
public service delivery outside Kabul.

23.    Opium Economy. The opium economy, accounting for around a third o f total (drug-
inclusive) GDP, has become Afghanistan's leading economic activity, with opium now produced
in all 34 provinces and millions o f people relying on it for livelihoods. Through its interactions
with warlords and other anti-state elements and its negative impact on governance, the drug
industry constitutes a central threat to the entire state-building and reconstruction agenda.
Dependence on opium production also leads to economic distortions that discourage development
of licit economic activities. The Government has, however, shown political will to implement a
strategy that combines drug eradication, interdiction, and promotion o f alternative livelihoods. In
2005, the area planted with opium decreased by 21 percent while production decreased by 4
percent (Table 1).

24.    Growth. Maintaining robust economic growth remains a critical challenge. Sustaining
 growth requires progress in a number o f areas, notably: ensuring security and the rule o f law;
maintaining macroeconomic stability; implementing the reconstruction agenda; reforming the
legal and regulatory framework to create a climate conducive to private sector investment; and,

                                                   7

more generally, buildingan effective and accountable State. Beyond the record harvests o f 2003
and 2005, sustained agricultural growth will require productivity gains from adoption o f available
technologies, rehabilitation o f irrigation schemes, and investments inrural roads for better access
to input and output markets. It i s also critical to generate private-sector led growth inthe industry
and service sectors.

25.    The Government's strategy provides a sound basis to foster economic growth and growth
will remain at the center o f the upcoming ANDs. As long as the Government makes continued
progress in implementing its development strategy and if the security situation improves,
economic prospects are good in the medium term. Real GDP i s expected to grow by an average
o f 12 percent per annum during the period 2005-07. Major sources o f growth are expected to be
in the sectors directly benefiting from the reconstruction effort (construction, Government and
other services) and private investment (including mining and telecommunications).                Increased
investment in irrigation and extension services i s expected to support sustained growth in
agnculture, which will provide alternative income opportunities to dissuade poppy production.

26.    Human Development. Despite significant progress over the last three years, substantial
challenges remain in the area o f human development (Table 2).                  The health o f the Afghan
population remains poor. Life expectancy at birth i s only 45 years. Under-five mortality rate at
230 per thousand live births remains one o f the highest in the world. There are also important
disparities between urban and rural areas in terms o f outcomes, coverage o f services, and
availability of health services. The maternal mortality ratio i s 15 times higher inBadakshan than
it is in Kabul; immunization coverage is three times higher in urban areas than in rural areas.
Regardingeducation, net enrollment i s as highas 80 percent inmajor cities but 47 percent inrural
areas; female net enrollment ratio i s 40 percent while that o f boys i s 67 percent. Women's
conditions remain particularly alarming, notably their health situation and lack o f access to
education. In addition, a significant proportion o f the population continues to live in extreme
poverty with inadequate social protection - with the disabled, female-headed households,
landless, and children without parents particularly vulnerable.

mountainous areas, it i s an enormous challenge to expand access to infrastructure to the rural
population.

28.     Revenue Mobilization. The Government is committed to increase domestic revenues to
implement its development strategy. In2005106, revenues are projected to increase significantly
to US$410 million (Table 3). In its Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF), the Government
indicated its ambition to cover its ordinary expenditures with its own revenues by 2010. Its
strategy i s based on: (i)     implementation o f tax measures approved over the last twelve months
(reintroduction o f the wage withholding tax, introduction o f a tax on selected "high-value"
services, a reduction in the corporate rate to 20 percent for all businesses, and a new rent
withholding tax); (ii)       selected additional revenue mobilization measures (such as excises); and
(iii)an increase in compliance by at least 10 percent per annum, based on the forceful
implementation o f a five-year plan to modernize customs and facilitate trade and a five-year plan
to modernize tax administration (notably the newly created Large Taxpayer Office).

31.    Risks.    The growth targets and fiscal framework outlined above are associated with
substantial risks.     The scenario assumes: (i)political normalization extending beyond the
completion o f the benchmarks o f the Bonn Agreement, (ii)steady improvement in security
conditions allowing implementationo f programs throughout Afghanistan, (iii)       steady progress on
the Government's reform program, (iv) strong private sector response, (v) continuing, well-
targeted donor support to Afghanistan, and (vi) favorable climatic conditions. Afghanistan has
little cushion to absorb the consequences o f any significant downside outcome in these areas.
Lack o f progress on the political or security front could negatively affect both the willingness and
capacity o f donors to support Afghanistan's reconstruction effort. It could also negatively impact
on the relationship between central Government and provinces, reinforcing warlordism and
reducing nation-building efforts.      This could lower real GDP growth. A worsening o f the
political and security situation could also favor the development o f poppy production with
associated negative impacts on security and political stability.      If the implementation of the
development strategy i s weaker than expected, private sector development would be negatively
affected. Reduced external assistance could also slow down reconstruction, with an adverse
impact on growth and nation-building efforts, and a potential impact on poppy culture, political
situation, and security. A protracted drought could hurt agriculture, the main source o f income,
with anegative impact onpoverty.


           111.           AFGHANISTAN'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

32.    The key elements o fthe Government's strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction
can be articulated around five areas o freform:

         Promoting Security and Rule of Law.           Security and rule o f law are fundamental
         prerequisites for political normalization, national reconciliation, reconstruction, and
         social development.
         Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability. Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework
         i s a prerequisite for broad-based economic growth.
         Strengthening Public Administration and Fiscal management. This key element o f the
         strategy includes: civil service, administrative capacity, budget preparation, public sector
         financial management, procurement, andrevenue mobilization and management.
         Enhancing Human Development. Buildinghuman capital through the implementation o f
         reforms inhealth, basic education, and social protection i s key for long-term growth.
         Promoting Private Sector Development.          The strategy supports the creation o f an
         enabling environment for private sector development through improvement in the
         investment climate, provision o f infrastructure including transport, power and
         telecommunications, financial sector development, state-owned enterprise restructuring,
         trade reform, agricultural development, and development o f the oil, gas and mining
         sectors.

33.    The series o f PSlBs supports an important subset o f the Government's strategy in the area
o f institution building (Section V). This area will remain a cornerstone o f the ANDs as the
Government progressively completes its strategic process (Para. 12).


A.      PromotingSecurity andRuleof Law

34.    Recent Achievements and Challenges.             The maintenance o f an adequate security
environment i s a critical element for the implementation o f the reformprogram supported by the
PSIBs and the macroeconomic framework that underpins them. Since the fall of the Taliban,
some progress has been made toward the establishment o f security and the rule o f law (Para. 8)
even if some areas of insecurity remain (Para. 22).        The National Security Council has been


                                                  10

created to coordinate the implementationo f the security strategy across ministries and donors and
ensure civilian control over the armed forces. Training o f the new Afghan National Police and
the ANA i s ongoing. A new program, Disbanding o f Illegal Armed Groups, has been created to
follow-up on the DDRprogram. A National Drug Control Strategy has been defined which aims
at eliminating the production, consumption, and trafficking o f illicit drugs through the (i)
provision o f alternative livelihoods for Afghan poppy farmers, (ii)extension o f drug law
enforcement throughout Afghanistan, (iii)implementation o f drug control legislation, (iv)
establishment o f effective institutions, and (v) introduction of prevention and treatment programs
for addicts. Main challenges include the continuous implementation o f a coherent and well-
coordinated strategy to reform the police and the judicial system. The police reform process has
been obstructed by issues o f coordination among stakeholders, alleged corruption, lack o f
capacity, and shortfalls in funding. The reform o f the justice system suffers from lack o f
independence o fjudges, concentration o f power and functions in the Supreme Court, inadequate
correctional facilities, inadequate legal framework, inadequacy o f the internal security forces,
perceptions o f corruption, and inadequate number o f criminal justice professionals.               Finally,
implementationo f the drug control strategy remains a challenge.

35.     Reform Strategy. In recognition o f the critical role o f security, the Government has
adopted a special MDG on enhancing security. The reform strategy seeks to address these
challenges. There are plans to train the new Afghan National Police and recruitment o f the ANA
i s ongoing. T o improve the judicial system and ensure its independence, the strategy includes
efforts to rebuild the administration o f juvenile justice, prison, and law enforcement systems.
Among the activities to be carried out are the establishment of new courts and the strengthening
o f legal aid services. The Government also seeks to build human rights institutions and capacity,
raise awareness, and seeks societal consensus around humanrights issues.


B.       Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability

B.l        Macroeconomic Policy

36.     Recent Achievements and Challenges. The maintenance o f a stable macroeconomic
framework i s a key trigger for PSIB II.3           Since the fall o f the Taliban, the Government has
maintained a stable macroeconomic framework (Para. lo), while growth prospects are good inthe
medium term (Para. 25).             Given country uncertainties, maintaining macroeconomic stability
remains a challenge.

 37.     Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to maintaining the implementation o f a
macroeconomic framework based on a strong commitment to fiscal discipline.                       Continuing
implementation o f the IMF's SMP provides evidence o f this commitment.                  Like PSIB I,the
proposed operation supports the Government's strategy to implement a stable macroeconomic
framework by (i)      providing budget support to fill a budgetary gap, (ii)     supporting an increase in
domestic revenues (Para. 41), (iii)        supporting the preparation o f a development strategy, and (iv)
 supporting the preparation o f an MTFF(Para. 39).

B.2        Budget Process

 38.     Recent Achievements and Challenges. The PSIBs support the Government's objective to
 strengthen the budget process. Adoption o f the PFEMLaw and the MTFF i s an important trigger
 for PSIB 11. In2004/05, buildingon earlier achievements (Para. 13), the budget has continued to
provide the framework to implement the development strategy. In June 2005, the PFEM L a w
 was gazetted and a Fiscal Policy Unit created inMoF. InOctober 2005, the Government adopted


   Triggers for PSIB 11, as describedinthe ProgramDocumentfor PSIB I(Report No. 28192-AF), and progress against
 these triggers are summarizedinTable 5.

                                                       11

an MTFF that outlines the key fiscal policies for the next three years. Four issues remain
however, inpart reflecting the challenges of coordinating external assistance through the budget.
First,the realism o fthe core development budget remains insufficient as reflectedby the shortfall
in spending in 2004105. This results from several factors, notably difficulties in getting clear
indications from donors on expected disbursements and lack o f capacity to screen projects and
prioritize them.     Second, linkages between the ordinary and development budgets are still
missing, a weakness compounded by the lack o f a clear distinction between the two budgets (the
development budget includes programs, e.g. the provision o f health services, which primarily
involve recurrent expenditures, while the ordinary budget includes some capital spending).
Third, the core budget is far from comprehensive, with three quarters o f external assistance,
including large amounts o f recurrent costs, flowing outside Government's accounts. Finally, the
budgetprocess has anumber of shortcomings: inparticular, no clear fiscal envelope i s set early in
the process and sub-national entities have limitedinputinto budget formulation.

39.   Reform Strategy. The implementation o f the PFEM Law i s expected to address a number
o f these shortcomings, requiring a medium-term perspective, an integrated and comprehensive
budget, and an orderly and transparent process. It will be supported by the reform o f the MoF's
Budget Department (reorganization along functional lines without separating the ordinary and
development budgets, strengthened capacity, and coordination with the Fiscal Policy Unit). The
proposed operation supports these two streams o f the Government's strategy to strengthenbudget
management.

B.3      RevenuePolicy and Administration

40.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. Progress in increasing revenues i s an important
trigger for PSIB 11. In 2004/05, the Government approved a number o f revenue mobilization
measures and continued implementation o f its revenue administration plans (Para. 28): tax
revenues increased by more than 50 percent. However, domestic revenues remain insufficient.
The first priority i s to further modernize revenue policy, notably by removing a number of small
"nuisance" taxes and expanding the tax base. The second issue i s to strengthen compliance, a
particular challenge in an economy dominated by informal activities, while increasing
transparency and developing appeal and complaint mechanisms that will be available to
taxpayers.

41.    Reform Strategy. The Government intends to increase domestic revenues to cover its
ordinary budget by 2010: progress inthat direction will be an important trigger for PSIB 111. The
reform strategy can be summarized along four priorities. First, with respect to tax policy, the
Government will implement the tax package recently approved. The Government will review the
tax code to simplify it and will study the possibility o f expanding the tax base. Second, with
respect to tax administration, the first focus i s on developing the capacity o f the Large Taxpayer
Office. Gradually, the reform process will be rolled out to provinces and Moustufiats will be
reformed through the PRR program to separate Treasury functions from revenue functions. With
respect to customs administration, the Government continues the implementation o f its five-year
strategic plan, with the refurbishment o f key border posts and the installation of a computerized
customs system (Para. 85 on trade facilitation). To support improvements incompliance, policies
will be developed to strengthen enforcement powers. Transparency will be improved (e.g. with
more solidprocesses for border clearance) and appeal and complaint mechanisms will be created.

B.4      Statistics and DataManagement

42.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. In2004105, the Government adopted a Statistical
Master Planto provide a roadmap for the development o f a viable statistical system. Progress has
been made in a number o f areas: (i)   price data (for production o f the consumer price index) are
now regularly collected in five cities outside Kabul; (ii)  except for 3 provinces, house listing for
the population enumeration (Phase 1 o f the census) has been completed; (iii)     preparations for the

                                                   12

Integrated Living Standard Survey (ILSS) and Integrated Business Enterprise Survey are moving
ahead; and (iv) a new round o f the National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment survey has been
launched, n o w covering both rural and urban areas. Progress has also been made in the health
and education sectors, a trigger for PSIB I1(Paras. 66 and 68). Inaddition, a new Statistical L a w
was approved in October 2005, granting independence to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).
The first challenge i s the weak capacity of the CSO. Second, the only information available to
formulate policies i s provided through a number o f uncoordinated piecemeal initiatives from
donors and line ministries.

43.    Reform Strategy. First, the implementation o f the Statistical Master Plan will continue,
including CSO restructuring.       In particular, an external review of the implementation of
administrative reform at CSO will be conducted. Second, data from the 2005 National Risk and
Vulnerability Assessment will be analyzed and the insights will be used to finalize the design o f
the ILSS.    In addition, as part of the ANDs preparation process, statistical priorities will be
assessed and a plan will be developed to produce indicators to monitor ANDs implementation.
Strengthened statistical capacity will be an important trigger for PSIB 111.


C.     StrengtheningFiscalManagementandPublicAdministration

C.l     Government Structure

44.    Recent Achievements and Challenges.          Important steps were taken in 2004/05 to
strengthen the Government's structure and develop its administrative capacity to formulate and
implement policies. These developments should be seen inthe broader context o f the PAR (Box
2). As part o f the December 2004 Cabinet reshuffling, the Cabinet was reorganized with fewer
ministerial portfolios. In addition, the creation o f Cabinet Committees i s expected to improve
policy coordination. At the ministerial level, the first stage o f the PRR program (Para. 16) has
been approved for 11 out o f 27 ministries and another 14 have developed their reform strategy,
now in the process o f implementation. Several ministries have created Program Management
Units to enhance their implementation capacity. However, at Cabinet and Ministry levels, the
capacity to develop and implement policies and programs remains limited and the impact of
recent achievements inthis reform area i s not adequately monitored and assessed.

45.    Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to strengthen its PAR strategy as part o f
the ANDs preparation to develop a more comprehensive approach to PAR. First, at the center,
the Government will continue institutional reform, notably implementing a PRR program for the
 Office of Administrative Affairs and creating procedures for the functioning o f the Cabinet. The
new Civil Service Law has established an Administrative Reform Secretariat (ARS) as the focal
point for PAR. Second, at the ministerial level, the PRR program will be strengthened as the
main vehicle for institutional reform, moving its focus from department specific reforms to
ministry-wide reforms, with more attention to the funding o f the non-salary component and the
 capacity to implement the reformprogram. It will be complemented by more in-depth reforms in
 selected agencies and more thorough monitoring and evaluation by the ARS. Progress in these
 areas will be a trigger for PSIB 111.

 C.2     PersonnelManagement

 C.2.a LegalFramework

 46.   Recent Achievements and Challenges. The PSIBs support the modernization o f the legal
 framework, which i s expected to reduce the scope for ministerial and political interference incivil
 service management. Progress under triggers for PSIB I1- increase in merit-based recruitment
 (Para. 16) and in the legal framework (Code of Conduct for Government functionaries and Civil
 Service Law) -has been satisfactory. The Law establishes as legal entities the IARCSC, as well


                                                 13

as the Appointment (responsible for merit-basedrecruitment o f senior civil servants) and Appeals
Boards (responsible for hearing complaints against unfair, illegal, or discriminatory behavior in
the workplace). The Law also establishes the principle o f recruitment based on open competition
and merit. There remain two main challenges however. First, the regulations to implement the
new Law need to be drafted. Second, there i s little capacity to process merit-based recruitment (a
responsibility o f the Appointment Board for senior positions and line ministries for other
positions) and effectively manage humanresources.

47.    Reform Strategy. First, the IARCSC will draft key regulations to implement the Civil
Service Law, including human resource regulations, appointment procedures, and appeal
processes. Second, the capacity o f the civil service management agencies will be strengthened.
Inparticular, bottlenecks to the merit-basedrecruitmentprocess have been identified and will be
addressed in 2006. A review mechanism will be set up to establish controls on the quality o f the
appointment process. Finally, Human Resources Departments in ministries and agencies will be
established as part o f the overall reform effort. Progress in implementing the Civil Service Law
and merit-basedrecruitmentwill be triggers for PSIB 111.

C.2.b Systems for Payroll

48.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. The Government has made significant progress in
implementing its Verified Payroll Plan (VPP), a trigger for PSIB 11, as evidenced by: (i)
maintenance o f a headcount database, (ii)registration and issuance o f Afghan Personal
IdentificationNumbers and photo ID cards to more than 6,000 Government employees inKabul,
(iii) initiation o f the implementation o f Individualized Salary Payments (ISP) to over 24,000
employees in 17 ministries and agencies inKabul, including 6,000 receiving payments in banks
from the list (400 directly into employee bank accounts), and (iv) piloting of a payroll database in
2 ministries. The attendance verifications performed by the ARTF's Monitoring Agent in Kabul
have revealed only very limited numbers o f ghost workers. However, due to a lack o f resources,
progress to implement this plan has weakened during2005.

49.    Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to implement its VPP, extending the
existing pilots o f ISP to cover at least 80 percent o f Kabul-based civil servants in 2006. In
particular, the Government intends to develop a computerized Human Resource Information
System that can dovetail with the AFMIS.          Improvements in this area will be supported by
improvements in the budget process (to ensure timely communication o f budget allotments and
establishment lists) and in financial management systems (notably AFMIS functionalities and the
audit processes). Progress to implement the VPP will be a trigger for PSIB 111.

C.2.c Salary and Pension

50.    Recent Achievements and Challenges.             In 2004105, the Government initiated a
comprehensive pay and grading review. A unified grading system has been designed and data
from a labor market survey collected. A modest pay increase was granted to civil servants in
2005, the first since 2003, while pension levels have remained stable after a significant increase
in2004. Some analyticalwork has also beeninitiatedonpensions, butno draft PensionLaw has
been prepared as envisaged as part o f the PSIl3 Iprogram. The first challenge in this area i s to
 finalize and implement the pay and grading review. The second issue i s to develop a long-term
pension policy and strengthen pensionadministration.

 51. Reform Strategy. First, the Government will develop its pay and grading strategy in line
with its objective o f fiscal sustainability and this new pay and grading system will be gradually
rolled out. Second, the Government intends to develop a civil service pension policy that i s
 financially affordable and modernize pension administration. Progress to link the pay reform and
the MTFF will be a trigger for PSIB 111.



                                                   14

C.2.d HumanResources

52.     Recent Achievements and Challenges. The Government met the trigger for PSIB I1to
place 15,000 positions under the PRR program. A number of capacity building initiatives have
started, including training and short-term recruitment programs (for lateral entrants and Afghan
expatriates) and the Government i s preparing its training policy. However, the administration
capacity remains weak, the outcome o f three decades o f conflict as well as the result o f
competition with NGOs and aid agencies. The problem i s particularly severe at management
levels, where a severe shortage o f people - especially women - with the required slulls i s
compounded by the absence o f merit-based appointments over many years. At middle and lower
levels, skills such as writing, management, planning, and usingIT systems are largely missing.

53.     Reform Strategy. The Government intends to continue implementation of existing short-
term recruitment programs and a strengthened PRR Program (Para. 45 and 5 1). These short-term
programs (Lateral Entry Program and Afghan Expatriate Program) will be strengthened with a
focus on monitorable results.       In addition, the Government will conduct a training and
development needs analysis and prepare a consistent and coordinated training strategy. Inthe
longer term, the Government also intends to design and implement a Retraining, Reskilling, and
Redeployment Program and build a proper human resource management system to continuously
enhance skills.

C.2.e Gender

54.     Recent Achievements and Challenges. In2004105, the Government initiated monitoring
of the gender composition o f the civil service in education. The Ministry o f Women Affairs has
established gender units in key ministries and a few piecemeal initiatives have been taken by
ministries to improve the representation of women.        Overall, it i s clear that women remain
seriously under-represented at all levels o f Government, the result o f considerable discrimination
against women especially under the Taliban regime. This has a considerable impact on the
capacity to deliver health and education services, notably to girls and women.

55.     Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to correct gender imbalances and one o f
its MDG objectives i s to reach parity between male and female civil servants by 2020. The
strategy consists o f establishing monitoring mechanisms to assess gender imbalance. On that
basis, targets will be established to promote female employment and a plan to achieve these
targets will be developed and implemented. To that effect, the IARCSC will develop a policy
note to enhance the role o f women in the civil service: preparation o f such a policy note will be a
trigger for PSIB 111.

C.3       StrengtheningSubnationalAdministration

56.     Recent Achievements and Challenges. Strengthening subnational administration i s a key
element o f the Government's objective to build an effective and legitimate State and deliver
 services throughout the country. In2004105, the PRR Program was rolled out to each provincial
department o f the Ministry o f Rural Reconstruction and Development and selected departments
of the Ministry o f Public Health (MoPH). It was also piloted inthe Balkhprovincial Governor's
 Offices  and two district Governor's Offices in the Northern region.         But the challenge o f
developing subnational administration's capacity remains immense. And, the management of
provincial municipalities   - the only administrative units outside o f central Government with an
independent budget process -remains weak.

 57.    Reform Strategy.     The Government intends to strengthen provinces' and provincial
municipalities' capacities to deliver services. First, the subnational administration strategy will
be clarified. Second, administrative reforms will be rolled out to provinces. Budget management
will be strengthened to enhance the role o f provinces in budget formulation and ensure more


                                                 15

predictability in the funds allocated to local units. Third, at the municipal level, the legal
framework will be clarified and municipalities' capacity will be strengthened.

C.4      FiduciaryStandards

C.4.a FinancialControlSystems and CashManagement

58.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. In 2004105, progress to raise fiduciary standards
has been satisfactory, a core trigger for PSIB 11. This i s notably evidenced by the increase inthe
share o f expenditures that are eligible for reimbursement to ARTF, from 87 percent in2003104 to
98 percent for wages, and from 27 percent in 2003104 to 65 percent for non-wage expenditures
(ratio o f eligible expenditures out o f those monitoredby ARTF's Monitoring Agent). Inthe area
o f financial management, the MoF's Treasury and Accounting Departments have been
amalgamated to clarify accountabilities.        The recently gazetted PFEM Law specifies clear
accountabilities in financial management and sets accounting standards in line with international
practice. Inthe area o f cash management, the Treasury has been maintaining simple cash plans
since early 2005.      Five main issues remain however.       First, the regulatory framework and
financial management processes need to be further strengthened.              Second, reconciliation
mechanisms remain insufficient, notably inprovinces. Third, service delivery units (e.g. schools)
still face a lot of uncertainty as to how much funds will be available to them. Fourth, the
feedback loop on compliance with rules on use o f funds comes primarily from the review by a
party external to the M o F - the ARTF's Monitoring Agent.           Finally, financial management
capacity remains dependent on external assistance.

59.    Reform Strategy. First, the Treasury will draft regulations to implement the PFEML a w in
order to clarify accountabilities and modernize business processes. Onthat basis, a systems study
will recommend improvements to be made to AFMIS and the system will be gradually rolled out
to line ministries and Moustufiats. Second, reconciliation will be developed, supported by
improvements in AFMIS and further progress in consolidating banking arrangements. Third,
improvements in the allotment process and implementation o f the new Chart o f Accounts (Para.
60) are expected to increase the predictability of funding to departments. Fourth, in line with the
PFEM Law, the MoF's Internal Audit Department will be reformed and an internal audit plan
prepared. Finally, financial management capacity will be developed through training programs,
reform o f line ministries' finance departments, and a strategy to gradually shift external support
to Treasury from an operational to an advisory and training role. Progress inthese areas, notably
through the adoption and initial implementation o f an Action Plan to strengthen Public Finance
Management, will be a trigger for PSIB 111.

C.4.b FinancialReporting

60.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. Significant progress has been made in 2004105
with regardto financial reporting, a trigger for PSIB 11. The 2003104 annual financial statements
were prepared and submitted to Cabinet in a timely manner. Monthly financial reports are
prepared by the Treasury and posted on the MoF's website. And, a new Chart o f Accounts was
introduced, providing a unified classification for the operating and development budgets in line
with international standards. The main issue remains the underutilization o f available fiscal
information for management andpolicy analysis purpose.

61.    Reform Strategy. As mandatedby the PFEMLaw, the MoF will prepare detailed quarterly
reports on public finances. Inaddition, a Fiscal Bulletin will be created to report to the public on
broader fiscal trends. The roll out o f AFMIS will provide line ministries with full and on line
access to the financial management system and improve capacity for reporting.

C.4.c   ExternalAudit and LegislativeOversight

62.   Recent Achievements and Challenges. In 2004, with the support from an international
firm (financed by IDA'SPACBP), the Government's external auditor -the Controller and Audit
Office (CAO) - audited most o f 2003/04 funds under Government's control, providing the most
comfort inthe last 10 years. The recently gazetted PFEM Law (as opposed to a new Audit Law,
as envisaged in PSIB I)     now provides the basis for external audit and its submission to the
Parliament. There remain three main issues. First, the regulatory framework needs to be further
strengthened, notably to develop the follow-up to audit findings and make it public. Second,
capacity o f the external auditor remains weak. Third, the election o f the Parliament brings the
challenges o f developinglegislative oversight o f the budget.

63.    Reform Strategy. First, a revision o f the regulatory framework, based on the PFEM Law,
will clarify the role o f external audit and the Government's responsibility to respond to audit
findings. Second, this will be complemented by capacity building programs. Third, the CAO
will develop a framework for the scrutiny and follow-up o f audit reports by the Parliament,
providing the basis for the establishment o f a Public Accounts Committee. Progress to enhance
the external audit function will be a trigger for PSIB 111.

C.4.d Procurement

64.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. In 2005, the Procurement Law has been gazetted,
which i s a trigger for PSIB 11. The Law establishes (i)   transparent and competitive procurement
procedures with contestable mechanisms based on objective and verifiable selection and award
criteria and (ii)the responsibilities o f government officials involved in procurement.
Implementingthe Lawraises three challenges. First, the institutional framework i s weak, with no
clear procurement champion in Government.               Second, supplementary regulations and
documentation are needed to set out specific parameters for public procurement, notably
qualification criteria, specifications, evaluatiodaward criteria, post tender negotiations, and the
time frame for settling tenders. Third, capacity inthe administration needs strengthening.

65.    Reform Strategy. First, a Public Procurement Unit (PPU) will be created inthe M o F with a
policy and a monitoring role.        The role o f the central procurement facility (Afghanistan
Reconstruction Development Services) will be clarified and a plan to progressively decentralize
all procurement responsibilities to line ministries through a medium-term approach, as envisaged
in the Law, will be prepared. A functioning Review Committee will be set up as per the new
Law. Second, the PPU will draft regulations and prepare adequate documentation, such as model
contracts, and lead the public awareness campaign on the Government's initiatives for a fair and
transparent procurement system in the country. A monitoring system will be put inplace, with a
pilot in ministries where the capacity i s already in place. Third, the PPU will implement a
strategy to increase procurement capacity in line ministries. Progress in implementing the
Procurement Law will be a trigger for PSIB 111.


D.      EnhancingHumanDevelopment

D.l      Health

 66.   Recent Achievements and Challenges. In 2004/05, the MoPH has made progress in
monitoring and evaluation o f health delivery, a trigger for PSIB 11, as evidenced by the
 completion o f a heath facility assessment. Progress in the sector (see para. 17) i s inter alia
 evidenced by: 66 percent increase in the number o f functioning health centers, increase in the
number o f facilities with trained female health workers (from 25 percent at baseline to 62 percent
 at mid-2005), deployment o f thousands o f community health workers, and reform o f the MoPH in
 Kabul and several provinces. However, much more needs to be done to first further increase
 coverage and, second, improve the quality o f care. Finally, the Government needs to further

                                                   17

develop its strategy in the sector as part o f the ANDs process, including about issues o f fiscal
sustainability -notably the cost o f operating hospitals.

67.    Reform Strategy. First, the MoPH will extend current arrangements (in 11provinces, the
MoPH either contracts NGOs to deliver services on a contestable basis under Performance-based
Partnership Agreements, or deliver services itself through its "Strengthened Mechanism") for
another 18 months. It will also expand the Basic Package o f Health Services coverage in rural
areas not covered by other donors, and finance polio, measles, and neo-natal tetanus
immunization campaigns. Second, with respect to quality, the MoPH will strengthen its capacity
to supervise service delivery. Third, for the longer term, based on a thorough evaluation o f
achievements under existing arrangements, the Government will define its strategy for the sector,
notably addressing the following questions: (i)      what are the key health areas for intervention
(maternal, basic health, hospitals)? (ii)   what are the long term roles o f the MoPH? and (iii) how
will health services be financed inthe long term (including role o f fees)?

D.2      Education

68.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. In2004105,the increase inrecurrent spending (50
percent above 2003104) has ledto an increase inthe provision o f education services, a trigger for
PSIB 11: combined with high demand, this has led to an increase in enrollment (Para. 17). The
Ministry o f Education (MoE) has completed a school survey and a Teacher Education Program
(TEP) to train and certify teachers has started. There remain four main challenges however.
First, while no output indicators (student learning achievement, completion rates, etc.) are
available, the available input indicators (teachers' background, curricula, textbook quality and
availability, conditions o f physical learning space) suggest that quality i s poor. Second, there are
large geographical and gender disparities. Third, progress in primary education needs to be
extended to secondary and higher education. Fourth, while the Government i s committed to the
goals of Education for All, the Government needs to fully define its strategy.

69.    Reform Strategy. First, on quality, the TEP will be the vehicle to develop national teaching
standards, a unitary teaching education curriculum, and a national pre-service and in-service
training system.     Second, the Government i s committed to reducing provincial and gender
disparities. Third, on secondary education, plans will be developed to address the projected
increase in enrollment in the years to come. Inhigher education, a draft L a w has been prepared,
which will increase the autonomy granted to universities, and, for the first time, the Government
i s allowing private institutions to operate inAfghanistan. Fourth, the Government will define its
strategy for the sector, notably addressing the following questions: (i) education does the
                                                                             which
Government plan to provide (primary, secondary, university) and what will be the role o f other
stakeholders (including local communities)?         (ii)what are the strategies to increase female
enrollment, especially where female enrollment i s currently low? (iii)        how will education be
financed  inthe medium-term (public versus private, cost recovery)? and (iv) what is the strategy
to raise the level o f teachers' qualification?

D.3      Social Protection

70.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. The coverage o f the existing social protection
programs has been extended (Para. 17), but there remain a number o f issues. First, the NSP needs
to be thoroughly evaluated to assess its impact and the potential for scaling-up. Second, the
NEEP has not been effectively targeted at the poor. Finally, existing programs need to be
complemented by a program targeted at the poorest (the Government has prepared a preliminary
design for a National Vulnerability Program to expand and rationalize the safety net system).

71.    Reform Strategy. First, an evaluation o f the NSP and an assessment o f the linkages
between Community Development Councils and district-level administration will be conducted.
Second, the NEEP will continue to provide much neededrural infrastructure and its strategy as a
multi-sectoral rural development program will be reviewed. Third, the Government will clarify
its strategy for the sector, addressing the following questions: (i) kind o f social safety net
                                                                      what
does the Government want to build (including issues o f targeting and delivery mechanisms)? (ii)
which steps can be taken to improve data collection and analysis, and create demand for these?
(iii) rolewilltheGovernmentandotherstakeholders,suchasNGOs,play?

E.     PromotingPrivateSector Development

E.l      Investment Climate

72.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. In 2004105, modest progress has been made to
review the legal and regulatory framework for private sector development, a trigger for PSIB 11.
A revised draft of the Law on Domestic and Foreign Investment, originally gazetted in2002, has
been completed and the tax-related articles have been gazetted with the Income Tax Amendments
inMarch 2005 (tax holidays and exemptions have beenreplaced by accelerated depreciation and
unlimited loss cany-forward, Para. 40). In addition, the corporate income tax rate has been
reduced to 20 from 25 percent. Finally, an IndustrialParks Authority was created. There remain
three challenges. First, the legal and administrative framework for land titling and property
registration needs to be modernized to provide for an effective and efficient dispute resolution
mechanism that will address outstanding claims, land acquisition, land allocation, eviction, and
mortgages. Secure property rights are critical for encouraging private investment. Second, a
legal andregulatory framework for establishing, operating, and ceasing business organizations (in
general and for insurance in particular) i s required. Third, the legal framework for industrial
parks needs strengthening.

 73.   Reform Strategy. The Government remains committed to supporting private-sector led
 growth within a sound legal and regulatory environment. First, on the issue o f property rights,
the Government intends to review and modernize the legal and regulatory framework in order to
 clarify property rights and land administration, as well as facilitate secured transactions. Second,
 a new Business Organizations Law has been drafted and will be the first building block o f a
 sound legal and regulatory framework: Cabinet approval o f this Law will be a trigger for PSIB
 111. Third, a law on land transfer for industrial parks will be developed and the legal and
 administrative structure for the Industrial Parks Authority clarified. Over time, these reforms will
 be complemented by other legalreforms, notably onthe non-banlung financial sector (see below).

 E.2     Infrastructure

 E.2.a Transport
 74.   Recent Achievements and Challenges. Transport, notably roads, i s the largest sector in
 terms o f public investment, with a focus on rehabilitation o f the highway corridors linkmg
 Afghanistan's main cities (Para. 18). However, the poor state o f the transport sector remains a
 key issue for Afghanistan's development (Para. 27). The first challenge i s to expand the stock o f
 infrastructure.  The second issue will be to operate and maintain this infrastructure.        In the
 2005106 budget, the Government i s providing for an additional USS8 million for highway
 maintenance, but this remains insufficient and implementation modalities remain to be defined.
 The third issue i s related to delivering transport services. Cutting across these challenges i s the
 fourth issue o fthe role o f Government (Ministries o fPublic Works and Transport) inthe sector.




                                                   19

75.   Reform Strategy. The Government's strategy consists o f (i)    rehabilitating the primary road
network and key airports to accommodate increasing traffic volume and promote trade, (ii)    setting
policies for operating and maintaining transport infrastructures with efficient financing and
provision o f services; (iii)
                            creating a regulatory framework to promote private sector participation
and provide efficient transport services; and (iv) restructuring the institutions involved in the
sector (with ministriesfocusing on setting policies, planningthe development of the country-wide
network, and setting standards and regulations and enforcing them).

E.2.b    Power Sector Development
76.    Recent Achievements and Challenges.           Implementation o f the investment program
outlined in the Power Sector Master Plan has started (Para. 18).         In 2004, the Cabinet has
approved the Electricity Policy Statement, which defines the respective roles o f the Ministry o f
Energy and Water (MEW) and the power utility (Da Afghanistan Brishna Moassesa, DABM).
Yet, power remains inaccessible for most o f the country (Para. 27).          There are three main
challenges in the sector.      First, critical to DABM financial viability is a move toward cost
recovering tariffs as current service in Kabul i s heavily subsidized by donors. Second, weak
capacity in the MEW and DAl3M remains a huge challenge to the implementation o f the
investment program. Finally, as in the case o f other infrastructure services, a major challenge i s
the provision o f electricity inrural areas. With the possible exception o f Herat, gnd expansion is
not possible currently due to insufficient generation capacity to serve even the urban areas.

77.    Reform Strategy. First, as part o f the ANDs, the Government will further clarify its vision
o f the power sector, including its strategy regarding tariffs, investments, and private sector
participation. The Power Sector Master Plan will continue to provide the basis for investment
prioritization. Second, the capacity o f MEW will be developed not only to lead the investment
program, but also to exert its regulatory role.       DABM managerial, technical, and financial
capacity will be strengthened by its corporatization under a new Board of Directors, restructuring
inthe form of regional business units, and computerization of accounts, billing, and collection.
Third, a rural energy strategy will be developed in consultation with MEW and Ministry o f
Reconstruction and Rural Development.

E.2.c    Telecommunications

78.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. The telecommunications sector i s developing very
rapidly, even though its quality and coverage should be further developed (Para. 18 and 27). A
first issue i s to further improve the regulatory framework in the sector to open it to greater
competition and strengthen the regulator (the Telecommunications Regulatory Board, TRB). The
second issue i s to strengthen the newly corporatized Afghan Tel.          Finally, the Ministry o f
Communications (MoC) has been leading an effort to create a Government Communications
Network and develop e-government applications, but the latter i s only starting.

79.    Reform Strategy.        On the first two issues o f regulatory reform and Afghan Tel
corporatization, the M o C has drafted two new laws, a telecommunications law and a separate law
covering the corporatization o f Afghan Tel. Substantial assistance will be required to further
develop TRB's capacity to develop policies and implement them.            M o C i s also expected to
further develop an e-government strategy.

E.3      Financial Sector Development

 80.   Recent Achievements and Challenges. In 2004105, progress has been made in reforming
the financial sector, a trigger for PSIB 11. The Central Bank and Commercial Banlung Laws have
been gazetted and twelve commercial banks licensed (including three re-licensed state-owned
banks).   DAB published externally audited 2003104 financial statements using internationally
accepted accounting standards. It has divested the majority o f its headquarter-based commercial


                                                   20

banking activities and divestment i s extended to branches in provinces where commercial banks
are active. Three state-owned banks (Banke Millie, Pashtany Bank, and Export Promotion Bank)
were re-licensed, with prudential performance conditions attached to their new bank licenses.
Progress has also been made indeveloping the micro-finance sector (Para. 19). However, lack o f
access to finance for small and medium enterprises remains one o f the major constraints for
private sector development. Further reforms are required with respect to four principal
challenges: (i)  the weak legal and regulatory environment for non-bank financial institutions, (ii)
the Central Bank still basic operational standards o f modem central banlung, (iii) o f progress
                                                                                   lack
in restructuring the three publicly-owned commercial banks and liquidation of banks that have
not been re-licensed, and (iv) the absence o f financial services inthe rural economy.

81. Reform Strategy. The Government will continue its efforts to rebuild the financial system
into a robust, sustainable, subsidy-free financial system that provides innovative services and
products to the country. The reform strategy includes four elements. First, DAB intends to
further develop prudential regulations and extend the renovation o f the legal framework to non-
banlung financial sector areas, such as insurance, leasing, and mortgage finance. Second, the
reform o f DAB will continue, by focusing its activities on its regulatory functions (continuing to
phase out its commercial activities) and strengthening its capacity. As it reduces its commercial
activities, DAB will encourage the expansion o f existing commercial banlung activities and
scaling up non-bank financial services. Third, the Government will prepare a specific action plan
for the resolution of state-owned commercial banks that includes, dates for the appointment o f a
comprehensive management team, a capitalization plan, and short and long term plans for the
rehabilitation and corporatization o f their urban and rural banking activities.       Finally, the
Government will develop a strategy to expand financial services to rural areas. Progress toward
non-banlung financial sector regulation and resolution o f state-owned banks will be a trigger for
PSIB 111.

E.4      State-OwnedEnterpriseRestructuring

82.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. Progress in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
reform i s a trigger for PSIB 11. There are more than 60 enterprises in Afghanistan that are
classified as SOEs, with about 20,000 employees, limited liabilities, and assets largely inthe form
o f land. Inaddition, the Government has a stake in other enterprises that are not defined as SOEs
under Afghan law. Progress has been made in2004/05 on three buildingblocks o f SOE reform.
First, a preliminary classification exercise, based on a survey o f SOEs, has been completed
(categorizing SOEs into those to be recommended for divestiture and those that will remain
SOEs). Second, draft amendments and Presidential Decrees have been prepared to address legal
issues, as the current legislation provides an adequate framework for liquidating SOEs but has no
provision for private sector participation in SOEs and does not cover privatization.         Third,
analytical work has started on the labor retrenchment issues. There remain however three main
issues. First, there i s uncertainty about the overall privatization policy o f the Government.
 Second, the legal and institutional framework needs strengthening. Third, as provisions regarding
 SOEs have been left out o f the PFEMLaw gazetted in2005, the quality o f financial management
inthe SOEs is inneed o f substantial improvement; there should also be a clear policy regarding
the operation o f SOEs that will be retained under Government ownership for the foreseeable
future.

 83.   Reform Strutegy. First,the Government intends to adopt a Privatization Policy to articulate
the principles ofprivatizationand lay out a transparent process for carrying out privatization and
liquidation. Second, the Privatization Policy will be followed by decrees to allow for
privatization, liquidation, and restructuring of SOEs and provide adequate retrenchment
packages. Finally, a clear policy will be developed to govern new investments and reporting
requirements o f the SOEs that will remain inGovernment ownership enterprises. Progress inthis
 area will be a trigger for PSIB 111.

                                                  21

E.5       Trade Reform

84.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. After the 2004 reforms (simplification o f tariff to a
six-band structure, with a maximum rate o f 16 percent and utilization o f a uniform floating
exchange rate), Afghanistan has one o f the most open economies in the region, with an average
tariff o f 5.3 percent. The import license application process has been drastically reduced. Border
and clearance times, while significant, are within a reasonable range for the region. Challenges
include: (i)  customs administration remains weak; (ii) issues needto be addressed; and (iii)
                                                         transit
institutional responsibilities inthe Government need to be clarified.

85.    Reform Strategy. The Government will: (i)support harmonization o f standards and
procedures and curtail smuggling, notably with the establishment o f a computerized transit
management system; (ii)     improve regional trade and transit issues - including development o f
efficient, safe, and reliable, transport corridors; and (iii)  clarify institutional responsibilities for
trade policies, promotion, and reform.

E.6       AgriculturalDevelopment

86.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. Given that around 80 percent o f the population
lives in rural areas, agricultural development i s at the core o f the Government's development
strategy. Cereal production has revived after several years o f drought and conflict and reached
record levels in2003 and 2005. Investments inthe sector are beingmade by the Government and
a number o f donors, notably in the context o f the counter narcotics strategy. With respect to land
issues, a Land Commission was established in 2004 to develop a draft land policy. However,
there remain four key issues in the agncultural sector: (i)    poor utilization o f water resources and
unsustainable water resource management practices; (ii)         dysfunctional research and extension
services; (iii) underdevelopment o f apculture markets and support services; and (iv) lack o f rural
credit. Some o f these issues stem from weaknesses in the legal framework for land rights, a
combination o f overlap, inconsistency, and uncertainty between several legal basis (customary,
religious, and state law).

87.    Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to create a framework conducive to
competitiveness and efficient factor markets in apculture. The Government's priority areas in
the short term include to: (i)  increase the productivity o f existing irrigated wheat areas; (ii)initiate
a program to support production and marketing o f highvalue horticultural crops by rehabilitating
orchards and improving quality management and marketing channels; and (iii)              address animal
health issues and improve rangeland management to ensure adequate fodder availability. A
strategy and time-bound plan are being prepared for an appropriate land-titling system and land
database.      Strategies are also being developed for rural credit.          Finally, the Ministry o f
Agriculture will build its capacity and focus on its core role (e.g. strengthening o f apcultural
statistics) while promotingprivate sector and NGOparticipation (e.g. inthe research area).

E.7        Oil, Gas, andMiningDevelopment

88.    Recent Achievements and Challenges. Afghanistan has substantial reserves o f solid
minerals, with known endowment o f base metals, coal, quarry materials, marble and dimension
stone, industrial minerals, semiprecious stones, and modest reserves o f natural gas.                 The
extractive industry sector can be a source o f economic growth and Government's revenues,
subject to significantregulatory and fiscal reform. Productiondeclined greatly duringthe conflict
years and the sector has missed a generation o f modem exploration technologies.               In 2005,
progress was made with the approval o f a modem Minerals Law and the preparation o f an
upstream Hydrocarbons Law. Much more work i s needed to develop and implement a proper
legal, fiscal, and contractual framework to attract investment and strengthen the capacity o f the
public institutionsincharge of regulating the sector.


                                                  22

89.   Reform Strategy. The Government i s committed to focusing its role on regulation and
developing a policy environment conducive to private sector participation. The laws will first be
completed and associated regulations will be prepared. The Ministryo f Mines and Industries will
be reformed to focus on key regulatory functions, including the cadastral office, mines
inspectorate, environmental standards, and will strengthen its financial management capacity to
assess royalties as well as undertake the tendering o f key assets.


                       IV.     BANK'S SUPPORT TO AFGHANISTAN

A.    Linkto the TSS

90.   After a gap o f more than two decades, IDA'Sre-engagement with Afghanistan began with
an Approach Paper to the Board in November 2001 (IDA/R-2001-23247)                  followed by a
PreliminaryNeeds Assessment preparedjointly with the UNDP and the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) at the beginning o f2002. A first TSS was presentedto the BoardinMarch2002 (IDA/R-
2002-0035) and proposed a 9-month emergency assistance strategy to support post-conflict
reconstruction and economic recovery as part o f a broader international effort, as well as the
establishment o f the ARTF. Initial Bank interventions focused on addressing urgent public
administration and fiscal management needs to enable the Government to rapidly build capacity
to oversee the reconstruction process. Other assistance provided investment funding for critical
short-term priorities including education, infrastructure rehabilitation, andjob creation.

91.   A second TSS (IDA/R-2003-022) was presented to the IDA Board o f Executive Directors
inMarch2003 to cover the next 18-monthto two-year perioduntilAfghanistan developed a new
Constitution and a stable, representative Government i s established, in line with the process
mandated by the Bonn Agreement. This second TSS was designed to focus IDA'Sfinancial
assistance and Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA) on supporting the Government's vision
and strategy for national reconstruction embodied in the NDF (April 2002). The TSS supports
four strategic areas: improving livelihoods; strengthening fiscal strategy, institutions, and
management; enhancing governance and public administration reform; and enabling private
sector development. The series o f PSIBs directly support the last three o f these strategic areas.
Due to delays in the political cycle in Afghanistan, the World Bank continues to operate under
this TSS and has informedthe Board that a new Interim Strategy Note is expectedto be prepared
inearly 2006 to linkwith the Government's InterimANDs (Para. 12).


B.     Coordinationwith Other Donors

92.   The budget i s the main instrument for donor coordination. Donors finance projects that
belong to the development budget. To facilitate donor coordination, a Consultative Group (CG)
has been created for each program o f the development budget while advisory groups are incharge
o f cross-cutting themes (for example gender and environment).             CGs are chaired by the
program's lead ministry and include representatives o f all donors involved inthe program, under
the leadership of a "Donor Focal Point'' (Table 4).        CGs have significantly improved donor
coordination, information sharing, budget preparation, and monitoring. Their performance has
been uneven across programs. The ARTF, which i s anchored in the budget, i s also increasingly
playing a coordination role for external assistance. It has recently introduced a schedule o f
quarterly meetings with the Government and donors to discuss policy issues.

 93.  The Government i s drafting its InterimPoverty Reduction Strategy (ANDs),which will lay
the basis for future donor coordination(Para. 12).

94.    The proposed Grant has beenprepared and will be implemented inclose collaboration with
the IMF and other donors. The Government's overall reform program i s designed within a
satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework as evidenced by the implementation o f the IMF's
SMP.      The preparation and future implementation o f the proposed Grant are being closely
coordinated with the IMF. The PSIBs incorporate the SMP macroeconomic framework and are
fully consistent with its structural benchmarks (which place considerable focus on promoting
fiscal discipline and public finance accountability). The preparation and hture implementation o f
the proposed Grant are also being closely coordinated with the ADB, which has prepared a new
programmatic operation (Fiscal Management and Public Administration Program) focusing on
budget formulation, revenue management, public administration, and treasury management
(which i s expected to be presented to ADB's Board in November 2005). The PSIBs are also
consistent with the support provided by donors through the ARTF. Indeed, ARTF funding is
integrated in the medium-term fiscal framework supported by the PSIBs, while ARTF supports
key fiduciary standards aiming at mitigating fiduciary risks. ARTF i s also expected to introduce
policy benchmarks.         Finally, many donors are active in the reform areas supported by the
proposed Grant.         Implementation o f this reform program requires significant Technical
Assistance (TA) under IDA projects (EPAP Iand 11, PACBP, and a new civil service
strengthening project under preparation), as well as ARTF, IMF, ADB, and bilateral support.


C.      InvestmentLending

95.     As o f end-September 2005, IDA's portfolio consists o f 17 active projects which support
GOA'Sdevelopment strategy. IDA's investment projects, which amount to a total commitment o f
US$771 million o f w h c h US$454 million have been disbursed, are as follows:



                                                       24

   0   Public Administration and Fiscal Management. The two EPAPs (US$10 million and
       US$8.4 million) and PACBP (US$27 million) provide funds to build a payment system at
       the Treasury and to raise the public sector's fiduciary standards. These projects support
       budget preparation and execution, expenditure accounting and reporting, procurement,
       and internal and external audit. EPAP I1also supports public administrationreform (PRR
       process and IARCSC).
   0   Human Development. The Health Sector Emergency Rehabilitation Project (US$59.6
       million) expands equitable delivery o f basic health services through performance-based
       partnership agreements with NGO service providers and the strengthening o f the MoPH.
       The Emergency Education Rehabilitation and Development Project (US$15 million), the
       Education Quality Improvement Project (US$35 million), and the StrengtheningHigher
       Education Project (US$40 million) support grants to schools and communities to
       rehabilitate schools, block grants to higher education institutes to improve student
       facilities, increase female enrollment, and improve the quality o f teaching, and
       institutional reforms in the M o E and MoHE (including development o f the management
       information system). The NEEP for Rural Access Project (US$39.2 million) aims at
       creating emergency short-term employment opportunities for the poor while improving
       rural access infrastructure. The Emergency NSP (US$123 million) aims at laying the
        foundations for local governance and assisting the reconstruction and development o f
       rural communities through the provision o f grants.
   0   Private Sector Development.          The Emergency Custom Modernization and Trade
       Facilitation Project (US$3 1 million) supports the customs reform program, including
        trade-related infrastructure. The Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (US$40
        million) aims at rehabilitating more than 1,000 small and medium irrigation schemes.
        The Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project (US$33 million) seeks to
        rehabilitate power distribution networks in Kabul and five other cities, and water supply
        systems intwelve provincial cities. The power component includes assistance to increase
        generation capacity in Kabul and prepare a power sector strategy.        The project also
        supports municipal public works programs that have implemented over one hundred
        labor intensive projects.    The Emergency Transport Rehabilitation Project (USS153
        million) finances the rehabilitation o f the main corridor from Kabul to Tajislustan,
        including the Salang Tunnel, and some civil work in Kabul airport. The Emergency
        Communication      Development      Project  (US$22    million)  seeks    to  rehabilitate
        communication infrastructure and provide the Government with communication
        equipment. The Power Rehabilitation Project (US$l05 million) seeks to restore and
        expand the distribution network, rehabilitate the largest generation station supplying
        Kabul and the associated transmission line, and improve commercial operations o f the
        utility. The Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project (US$25 million) focuses on upgrading
        a few areas o f Kabul, developing capacity for land tenure regularization, and supporting
        the capacity o f the Ministry o f Urban Development and the Kabul Municipality. Finally,
        an Investment Guarantee Facility was created to provide political risk insurance and
        attract foreign investments; IDA financed US$5 million of the facility inpartnership with
        MIGA, ADB, and DfID.

96. The Bank also administers the ARTF createdinMay 2002. Donors' contributions to ARTF
amounted to US$lS5 million in 2002/03, US$286 million in 2003/04, and US$380 million in
2004/05, mainly to support the ordinary budget, but also several investment projects.
Contributions to the ARTF are anticipated to amount to US$462 million in 2005/06. Since its

D.    Analytical and Advisory Services

97.   Knowledge partnership is a core element o f IDA'S assistance to Afghanistan. Based on in-
depth engagement and analytical work in several sectors, the Bank has made significant
contributions to the formulation o f the Government's strategy as outlined in the report Securing
Afghanistan s Future. The Government provided strong positive feedback about Bank analytical
and advisory services. AAA also support the reform areas o f GoA's strategy as follows:

       Security and Rule of Law.         A paper titled AfghanistanS Opium Drug Economy
       (December 2004) builds on analysis used as an input for the Government's report
       Securing Afghanistan 's Future (March 2004) and provides an updated economic view to
       address issues in the Government's national drug control strategy. A report on "Building
       an Effective Anti-money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Regime in
       Afghanistan    "brought together members o f Government and the private financial sector
       to assess the challenges to address these issues inAfghanistan.
       Public Administration and Fiscal Management. TA has been continuously provided for
       fiduciary   areas and civil service reform.     A Workshop on Economic Management
       Strategy was held on April 2003. Also, a comprehensive analysis o f the structure and
       work o f sub-national administration has been conducted in partnership with the
       Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU), leading to a constructive policy
       dialogue with the Government on public administration reform as well as a reference
       report A Guide to Government in Afghanistan and a policy paper Subnational
       Administration in Afghanistan: Assessment and Recommendationsfor Action (December
       2003). Afghanistan: State Building, Sustaining Growth, and Reducing Poverty, the first
       Bank economic report on Afghanistan in more than 20 years, was prepared in 2004. A
       Public Finance Management Review, combining a Public Expenditure Review, a Country
       Financial Accountability Assessment, and Country Procurement Assessment Review, i s
       being finalized (see Annex 3). Training has also been provided in the area o f Public
       Finance Management. Technical assistance i s also beenprovided on pensions.
       Human Development.        An Education Policy Note was prepared in 2004.           Poverty,
        Vulnerability, and Social Protection: An Initial Assessment was finalized in 2004, based
       on a household survey completed in collaboration with the Government. Afghanistan:
       National Reconstruction and Poverty Reduction - the Role of Women in Afghanistan's
       Future, a Gender Assessment, was finalized in2005. A note on food policy was prepared
        in2004.
       Private Sector Development. Analysis has focused on sectors that are key for private
        sector development including: a workshop on rural financing (December 2004), Trade
        and Regional Cooperation between Afghanistan and its Neighbors (February 2004),
       Afghanistan: Financial Sector Reforms (March 2003) and Afghanistan Border States
       Development Framework (November 2001). AnInvestment Climate Assessment i s under
       preparation and the survey has already been conducted. A note on the Rural Energy
        Strategy i s under preparation. A report onLand issues in Kabul i s also under preparation.
        IDA provided TA to prepare the Mining Law and the Hydrocarbon Law. The Report
       Mining as a Source of Growth (December 2003) assesses the existing mineral production
        and potential for development and addresses the challenges faced by the Government to
        establish an enabling environment which will regularize existing production and
        stimulate new investments. TA has been provided at the regional level in the area of
       power trade. Some work has also been done on water issues, notably on riparian issues
        and technical assistance provided to build capacity for social and environmental
       management.

E.     LessonsLearned

98.   The Bank has now been active in Afghanistan for the last three and a half years. Through
the successful implementation o f PSIB I,other investment operations, and analytical work as
described above, a number o f lessons have been learned.

99.   First, there is a need to focus on a few critical areas as the Government's capacity is
limited. The capacity o f the Ministry o f Justice to process the ambitious legal agenda remains
weak. This i s why each PSIB focuses on a limited number of critical legislations. As this
legislative challenge will only increase while the Parliament buildsits own capacity, the proposed
operation supports a number o f reforms to implement recently approved laws rather than
supporting an ambitious legislative agenda.

100. Second, also related to the issue o f Government's capacity, reforms supported by this series
o f operations need to be supported by appropriate technical assistance in the form of investment
projects and AAA services (including policy dialogue, workshops, policy notes and reports,
Section D). Inthe areas o f public finance management and public administration, IDA has been
providing Grants and Credits that support operational and advisory technical assistance, as well as
system investments. Such technical assistance needs to be well focused and managed to achieve
results. IDA has also been constantly engaged inthe policy dialogue through analytical work.

101. Third, the country situation and risks, notably those related to security and political issues,
require a flexible and opportunistic approach. The rollout to provinces o freforms such as AFMIS
implementation or individualized salary payments is, for instance, subject to security and
communication constraints. This lesson validates the design o f the PSIBs as a series o f one-
tranche operations and the continuous dialogue with the Government on program implementation.
It should also be recognized that a number o f the areas supported by these operations have final
objectives which go beyond the timeframe o f these operations.

 102. Finally, strong ownership o f the program i s critical for its success. The significant progress
withrespect to fiduciary standards is a testimony to the strong leadership exertedby the MoF. On
the other hand, slower progress in the area o f pensions can be partly attributed to difficulties in
getting the various stakeholders to come to a common vision. Similarly, further progress in the
area o f SOE reform i s conditional on a broad ownership o f the Government's strategy. The fact
that both previous and current Governments have met all substantial PSIB and IMF's SMP
benchmarks reflect strong Government ownership o f these programs.

                                                BUILDING

 A.     Descriptionof the Operation

 103. Reform Program. The Government's development strategy i s described in Section I11and
 its policy action matrix i s attachedto the Letter o f Development Policy (LDP, see Annex 1). The
 Government has requested IDA to support an important subset o f the reforms outlined in its
 strategy while different donors are supporting other reform areas. The reformprogram supported
 by the Grant is outlined in the attached Letter o f Development Policy. This operation is the
 second in a series o f Programmatic Support for Institution Building operations.          This series
 provides rolling support for the Government's development strategy with each operation
 specifying a set o f triggers which, when met, provide the basis for proceeding with the next
 operation.




                                                   27

104. Objective. The overall objective o f this operation i s to continue deepening, broadening,
and sustaining the reforms underway inthe areas o f public administration and fiscal management,
in the context of macroeconomic stability.         The operation complements a series o f IDA'S
investment and technical support operations aiming at building the Government's capacity in
financial management, raising fiduciary standards, and reforming public administration.           By
supporting institution building, the operation more broadly contributes to the Government's
development objectives. In particular, it supports the implementation o f reforms that lead to
better allocation o f fiscal resources inthe areas o f human development (health and education) and
private sector development (investment climate, financial sector, and state-owned enterprises).
This operation should be seen as complementing separate investment and technical assistance
operations in the areas of human and private sector development, with the set o f operations
seeking to achieve the implementation o f comprehensive sectoral reforms.


B.     PriorActions for PSIBI1

105. As reviewed in Section 111, the Government has made satisfactory progress toward the
triggers for PSIB I1that were agreed as part o f the PSIB Iprogram in July 2004. On that basis,
prior actions for PSIB I1were identified incollaboration with the Government as a subset o f these
triggers. Table 5 describes the original triggers for PSIB 11, achievements against these triggers,
and comments on these achievements inthe context o fthe broader reformprogram.

106. The prior actions for PSIB I1can be summarized as follows (inbold inTable 5):

     0   Progress to strengthen fiduciary standards as evidenced by: (i)      decrease in the ARTF
         ineligibility ratio for non-wage expenditure (amount o f expenditures ineligible to ARTF
         divided by amount monitored by ARTF's Monitoring Agent) below 35 percent; (ii)
         decrease o f the comparable ratio for wage expenditure below 5 percent; and (iii)
         gazetting o f the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PFEM) L a w and the
         Procurement Law;

     0   Completion o f a baseline evaluation o f health service delivery performance;

     0   Completion o f a census o f teachers;

  C.      Triggers for PSIBI11

  107. Progress in several reform areas i s deemed important for the sustainability o f the
  Government's program. Through ongoing dialogue with the Government, triggers to measure
  progress inthese areas have beenjointly identified (see Section V1.A on Government ownership).
  The Letter of Development Policy describes the Government's objectives in these reform areas,

                                                               30

                          VI.      OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

A.     Country Ownership

109. The policy and strategy framework for PSIB i s driven by national priorities for state
building, economic growth, and poverty reduction as reflectedinthe Government's development
strategy and the National Budget. The implementation o f PSIB I,    as well as the achievements o f
all benchmarks under two tranches o f the ADB budget support operation and the completion o f
five reviews under the IMF's SMP, has shown that ownership o f the program by counterpart
ministries and the Central Bank i s strong. The definition o f the reform areas supported by the
PSIBs, prior actions, and triggers results from a highly collaborative process between the Bank
and the Government under the leadership o f MoF.

110. Several aspects o f the PSIBs are expected to foster and support broader country ownership.
First,the PSIBs provide incremental fundingto the Government that can be used strategically to
implement centrally-funded development programs country-wide. Second, the PSIBs allow the
Government to continue establishing a record o f accomplishments while adapting its reform
program as it goes forward. For example, the number o f prior actions and triggers included in
this operation reflects not only the solid achievements to date, butalso the level o fchallenges that
the Government i s willing to confront. As such, the PSIBs can be used strategically as they
provide both leverage to implement core reforms and the flexibility required to adapt to
unforeseen developments, which can only increase overall country ownership.


B.     MonitoringandEvaluation

111. The Government has made some progress in2004/05 indeveloping its capacity to monitor
and evaluate outcomes o f and progress under its reform program. A new Statistical L a w has been
adopted. Regular statistics are collected and published by DAB and M o F in the monetary and
fiscal areas. The PFEM Law calls for the regular publication o f detailed fiscal data. The M o E
and the MoPH have initiated the development of management information system to monitor
education and health indicators.      The second National Vulnerability Risk Assessment, now
extended to urban areas, i s under implementation.       Work for an ILSS has started.        MDG
indicators have also been compiled inthe context o f the Afghanistan MDGreport (Table 2). The
IMF's SMP has also led to more frequent and robust reporting (national accounts, monetary and
fiscal data).

112. However, there remain many gaps and the statistics sector needs institutional reform. The
Government i s committed to continue developing its statistical capacity. The ANDs will outline
key indicators and a framework to monitor progress under the development strategy and provide
critical inputs into the decision malung process. Implementing this monitoring and evaluation
framework will require enhancing capacity at all levels o f planning, design, data collection, and
analysis, encompassing a wide range o f fields (statistical, administrative, managerial, technical,
and analytical). This will be supported by the implementation o f the Statistical Master Plan,
which was approved by the Government in 2004. Progress inthis area will be a trigger for PSIB
I11(Para. 43) and is also supportedby the IMF's SMP.

                                                  32

113. IDA, incollaborationwith several other agencies, has contributedto the development o fthe
Statistical Master Plan. This plan provides the framework for IDA's technical assistance to build
capacity to evaluate and monitor outcomes related to poverty and social development. Reforms
supported by this Grant                                                                                          -          including implementing the PRR at CSO, completing analysis o f the
National Vulnerability Risk Assessment, finalizing an implementation plan to produce indicators
to monitor the ANDs, and implementing the PFEM Law and the Procurement L a w - comprise
important elements o f this plan to strengthen the Government's capacity to monitor and evaluates
outputs and outcomes.                                                                                               IDA has recently conducted in collaboration with the Government a
Public Finance Management Review, which has expanded the available analysis and evaluation
o f public expenditures. Inparticular, the performance o f the PFM systems has been rated using
the framework developed by IDA and other development partners under the Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability program (Annex 3).                                                                                                                                                           Inaddition, depending on progress with the
ILSS, IDA's work program may include a Poverty Assessment, which will help monitor public
spending as well as its impacts on poverty. This inturn will permit IDA and the Government to
intensify their dialogue on the equity impact o f public spending which will also contribute to
refine the development strategy.

 114. Inthe short term, monitoring and evaluation o f the PSIl3 program will continue to focus on
 processes and inputs, as opposed to outcomes. Table 6 summarizes key indicators that will be
 monitored, including two impact indicators that are beyond the Government's control, while
 Annex 4 describes in more details the monitoring and evaluation framework. With the reforms

                                                                                                                                                                                                      33

supported by PSIB 11,monitoring and evaluation o f the PSIB program i s expected to be gradually
enhanced with a monitoring o f outcomes.


C.     Fiduciary Aspects

115. As outlined in Section I11and as evidenced by the improvements in the ARTF eligibility
ratio, significant progress has been made over the last three years to reduce fiduciary risks. These
risks remain however high and a number o f measures are taken to mitigate them (Section G).
First, several o f the triggers for the proposed operation (notably the gazetting o f the PFEM and
Procurement Laws) have laid the ground for further improvements in fiduciary standards and the
proposed triggers for PSIB I11 include further progress in the fiduciary areas (Section 1II.C).
Second, this program i s complemented by a series o f IDA investmentprojects to strengthen the
treasury, procurement, internal and external audit functions (Section IV). Third, IDA has
conducted a Public Finance Management Review, which provides the analytical underpinnings
for the fiduciary aspects o f the PSIBs. As part o f this review, PFM performance was rated
against internationally accepted indicators (Annex 3).        The monitoring framework o f this
framework i s designed to track progress toward an increase in fiduciary standards (Annex 4).
The full transfer o f responsibility to the Government for financial management, procurement, and
audit (currently supported by IDA through the PACBP and other donors) might temporarily
increase fiduciary risks due to lack o f capacity. However, such a temporary increase i s deemed
unavoidable inorder to decrease fiduciary risks inthe long-term.

116. The Central Bank has published its audited 2003/04 financial statements based on
international standards. The IMF expects to conduct a Safeguard Assessment o f the Central Bank
inthe event ofnegotiationofaFund-supportedprogram. Therefore, to monitor the flow of funds
at DAB, for the purpose o f this operation, a dedicated Deposit Account will be established at
DAB (see below).        This account will form part of the country's official foreign exchange
reserves.


D.     Grant Administration,Disbursement, and Auditing

117. Grant Amount, Benejiciary, Terms, and Tranching. The Recipient i s the Islamic
Republic o f Afghanistan, represented by MoF. The Grant i s for an amount equivalent to US$80
million, on standard IDA terms to be released in one tranche following approval o f the Grant and
notification by the Association o f Grant effectiveness. The completion o f the prior actions is
sufficient to release the Grant.

 118. Implementation, Monitoring, and Supervision. Duringthe preparation o f the Grant, IDA
has assisted the Government to help ensure timely implementation o f the agreed measures.
Ministries responsible for monitoring progress have been identified and a plan to monitor
indicators developed. To assess the impact o f the proposed operation, IDA will monitor progress
inachievingthe triggers described inthe LDP.

 119. Grant Management. A dedicated Deposit Account in US Dollars will be established at
DAB inthe name o f the MoF. The Account will be managedby MoF, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. The only funds paidto this account would be the proceeds o f the Grant.

 120. Disbursements. Upon notification by IDA o f Grant effectiveness, and with the submission
by the Recipient o f a withdrawal application, the proceeds o f the Grant will be deposited by IDA
into the Deposit Account o f the Recipient. An amount equivalent to the Grant proceeds will then
be credited to an account o f the Government to finance budgeted expenditures. Disbursements
will not be linked to specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed.
However, the proceeds o f the Grant cannot be used for ineligible expenditures (i.e. to finance
items imported from non-member countries, or goods and services from the IDA'S standard

                                                  34

negative list). If, after deposit into the Deposit Account, the proceeds of the Grant are usedfor
ineligible expenditures, IDA will require the Recipient to either (i)     return the amount to the
account for use for eligible purposes, or (ii)     refund the amount directly to IDA. Eligible
expenditures would include payments by the GOAto meet its external service obligations,
provided that there are legal agreements that establish such external debt service obligations.
Transactions and balances o f the Government account will be fully incorporated into the
Government's accounting records and financial statements, via the AFMIS.

121. Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing. Schedule ISection 2(F) o f the Development Grant
Agreement gives IDA the right to require the Recipient to audit the Deposit Account through
agreed. Inaddition, IDA may also request audits o f the Deposit Account prior to its closure in
accordance with Section 3.02 o f the Development Grant Agreement. Given IDA'Sexperience
with the use of DAB for the special accounts o f its projects, IDA does not intend to request the
Borrower to have the Deposit Account audited.

122. CZosingDate. The expected closing date o f the Grant will be September 30,2006.


E.     Environmental Aspects

123. The policies for institution-building supported under this operation focus on a subset o f the
Government's overall program and are not likely to significantly affect the environment. As
summarized in Section V, the specific actions included in the areas o f maintaining
macroeconomic stability, strengthening public financial management, public administration, and
statistical capacity, enhancing human development, and promoting private sector development
focus on activities that aim at establishing legal, administrative, and regulatory functions o f the
State. They do not include physical investments or policy changes that would significantly affect
the environment. As a result, specific policies supported by this operation are not likely to have
any significant impact on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources.


F.      Povertyand SocialImplications

 124. The poverty and social implications o f the reform program supported by the Grants were
reviewed. Most o f the reforms supported by the program are expected to have positive impact on
poverty reduction, notably by increasing and allocating fiscal resources in line with
Government's medium term priorities. SOE reforms could have an adverse social impact. This
impact i s likely to be limited as employment in SOEs i s low (Para. 124) and the Government has
already initiatedanalytical work to prepare a plan that would provide adequate protection to SOE
employees. IDA will continue reviewing proposals in this area. Finally, the Grants support the
development o f a monitoring and evaluation framework to support policy-malung. This will
enable analysis and dialogue on the distributional effects o f the reform program, notably the
impact on gender equity (reducing regional and rural-urban inequities in service provision) and
vulnerable groups (poor, single-parent households, migrating communities).


 G.     Benefits,Risks,and RiskMitigation

 125. Benefits. The PSIB Grants provide potential benefits that will all contribute to economic
 growth and poverty reduction.          First, they strengthen public administration and fiscal
management, and support reforms to improve fiduciary standards. Inaddition, IDA'Ssupport to
the Government's development strategy in the form o f PSIBs i s seen as a catalyst for other
 donors' continuing support. This will reduce the implementation risks o f all projects including
this operation, and is likely to translate into higher levels of donor assistance through the budget.
 Second, the Grants support a strengthening o f the Government's institutional capacity and
provide resources to the central Government to deepen its reform program, which will facilitate

                                                   35

the implementation o f its programs, including service delivery beyond Kabul. This complements
other IDA investment projects as well as analytical and advisory services (Section IV). This will
benefit the whole population including the poor, and contribute to mitigate the risk o f
deterioration o f the political and security situations.        Third, the Grants also support the
implementation o f reforms leading to more efficient allocation o f fiscal resources in the areas o f
human development and private sector development, which will reduce poverty.

126. Risks. The Grants have significant country (political, security, and macroeconomic),
fiduciary, and implementation risks (Table 7). A reversal inthe political stabilization process or a
deterioration o f the security situation constitutes the largest source o f risk for the operations.
Continuing security incidents are a manifestation o f such risks.          The election o f Parliament
increases uncertainties as the emerging political consensus remains fragile. The Parliament is
anticipated to meet for the first time in December 2005. As members have been elected on an
individual (as opposed to party) basis, there i s likely to be a period o f adjustment as alliances are
formed.     An optimistic scenario would have the Parliament forming clear groupings that
cooperate and support the ongoing reform process. However, it i s also possible that significant
divergences among Members o f Parliament could not only stall the reformprogram but also lead
to political uncertainty and associated unrest.       The implementation o f the counter narcotics
strategy i s also a source o f country risks: on the one hand, the illicit opium economy can continue
to undermine state-building,while, on the other, poor sequencing o f law enforcement activities
including eradication could have significant economic, social, security, and political effects. The
macroeconomic scenario i s also uncertain since both donor assistance and the response o f the
private sector are highly dependent on the political and security situation, as outlined in Section
11. The mitigation o fthese countryrisks is outside the scope o fthe project. However, the Grants
will allow the Government to deepen the implementation o f its program, which will contribute to
the nation-building effort andwill help mitigate political and security risks.

 127. The Grants also have fiduciary and implementation risks (including weakened ownership
and weak capacity to implement the budget and the reform program). Some o f these risks have
materialized during the implementation o f PSIJ3 I(for instance the capacity to gazette laws,
Section IV.E). However, the proposed operation builds on significant achievements. First, as
outlined in Section I11and reviewed in Annex 3, fiduciary standards and budget implementation
processes have been significantly improved, partly the result o f this series o f PSBs. Inaddition,
the arrangements in place for the ARTF and IDA'Sprojects (EPAP and PACBP) provide direct
support to the Government's fiduciary systems and contribute to higher fiduciary standards for all
Government transactions. Despite these mitigating factors, fiduciary risks remain significant,
including vulnerability to corruption, and will be closely monitored in consultation with other
donors. Second, the Government has demonstrated ownership o f the program by establishing a
track record o fpolicy reform(see Section V1.A).

 128. To mitigate these risks, prior actions and triggers focus on areas for which the Government,
under the leadership o f the MoF, has expressed ownership and has already built a good track
record o f reforms.     IDA and other donors are also supporting the Government's efforts to
 strengthen its implementation capacity through investments and technical assistance. Continued
IDA assistance - together with the next Grant's triggers - in the areas o f public finance
management and public administration, will also contribute to raising fiduciary standards and
implementation capacity. Finally, the program design as a series o f operations based on prior
 actions provides IDA with the scope to adjust subsequent operations to the security and political
 situation and the pace o freform implementation.

                                        I.INTRODUCTION
Background

1.      Following the Presidential elections in late 2004, the new administration has been
emphasizing the importance o f moving from the concept o f post-conflict emergency management
to a more medium-term sustainable development framework and increasing Government
ownership o f policies. Two decades o f conflict had reduced physical and social infrastructure to
skeletal proportions. Coherent Government and administration were non-existent. Social
indicators were among the world's lowest, and simply maintaining security was an immense
challenge. This transition necessitates reorienting efforts from day-to-day management in
ministries and Government agencies to emphasizing forward looking strategies.

2.       Establishingthe institutions and processes necessary for a peaceful political transition has
been at the forefront o f the Government's agenda, and in line with commitments made at the
Bonn Conference. Both the presidential and parliamentary elections (September 2005) were
significant achievements for Afghanistan and district elections are programmed in 2006.          The  -
Government i s also implementing a number o f reforms inthe security sector to establish the rule
o f law.

3.       The transition from emergency response to long-term sustainable development will need
to be underwritten by a robust economic development strategy. At present, building on the
achievements of the National Development Framework developed in 2002 and the three budgets
approved since, the Government i s preparing the Interim Afghanistan National Development
Strategy (I-ANDs),which will also form the basis o f the interim poverty reduction strategy.

4.       Rebuilding economic and financial institutions and implementing sound macroeconomic
policies have been clear priorities. Important economic and institutional reforms have been
undertaken.

Recent Economic Developments

5.       Real GDP growth i s estimated at 8 percent in 2004/05, reflecting a stronger-than-
anticipated performance o f the manufacturingsector. Economic activity during the first quarter o f
2005/06, which was led by a rebound in agricultural production and continued strength in the
other sectors. Year-on-year inflation declined substantially in Kabul during the first quarter of
2005/06, to 11.5 percent year-on-year at end-June from 16.3 percent at end-2004/05.

6.       Agricultural development i s at the core o f the Government's development strategy.
Cereal production has revived after several years o f drought and conflict and reached record
levels in 2003 and 2004. Investments in the sector are being made by the Government and a
number o f donors, notably in the context of the counter narcotics strategy. Due to a substantial
reduction in cultivation, opium production appears to have declined in 2005. This reduction in
cultivation, observed inmost provinces i s expected to be only partly offset by a rebound inyields,
which had fallen by 29 percent in2004 because o f l o w rainfall and the prevalence of diseases.

                                                                                         Annex I
                                                                                     Page 3 of 26

7.       These were encouraging developments in the monetary sector in maintaining price
stability and a relatively stable exchange rate. Stricter monetary policy was executed to control
the growth o f currency in circulation.      Despite the lack o f sophisticated monetary policy
instruments, the Government has had considerable success in meeting its monetary objectives.
The monetary policy institutional framework was strengthened by establishing a monetary policy
committee in charge o f daily operational issues. Currency in circulation increased by 38 percent
inthe twelve months to March2005 reachingAfs 39.6 billion. This growth was also reflected in
accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. International reserves reached $1.3 billion by March
2005, equivalent to 3.9 months o f projected2005/06 imports.

8.       Progress was made in strengthening the banlung sector regulatory framework. The
cessation o f D a Afghanistan Bank's (DAB's) headquarters-based commercial activities i s
completed, The ownership o f the silver and gold held in the palace vaults was transferred to
DAB. DAB'Scommercial holdings, which comprised state-owned banks and enterprises, were
transferred to the government. The audit o f DAB'S end-2003/04 financial statements was
published. The commercial banlung law was published in the Official Gazette and a set o f new
banking regulations, related to corporate governance, foreign exchange positions, and
enforcement activities, was adopted by DAB's Supreme Council. The foreign exchange auctions
system was modernized by moving to a standard auction system (with confidential bids; no
renegotiation; and the possibility o f multiple bids), and by allowing commercial banks to
participate along with the money-changers.         Finally, DAB has started to enforce reserve
requirements, currently set at 8 percent.

9.       The Government is committed to increase domestic revenues to implement its
development strategy. In2005/06, the Government intends to collect US$468 million (including
US$80 million o f telecom licenses), much above the budget target o f US$333 million. The
Government's objective i s to cover its ordinary expenditures with its own revenues. The strategy
i s based on: (i)implementation o f tax measures; (ii)  revenue mobilization measures; and (iii)
                                                                                               an
increase incompliance (notably with the creation o f a Large Taxpayer Office).

                       11. STRUCTURALREFORMAGENDAUNDERPSIBII

Maintenanceof Satisfactory Macroeconomic Framework

 10.     The Government o f Afghanistan i s maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework.
Domestic revenue i s increasing and monetary policy has been restrained, supported by the
adherence to strong fiscal discipline and a "no overdraft" rule that prohibits Central Bank
financing o f the deficit. The exchange rate remained stable.

Fiscal andPublicFinanceManagementIssues

 11.     Under the new leadership o f the Ministryo f Finance (MoF, January 2005), there has been
particular attention to espousing fiscal discipline. This was evident inthe 1384 Operating Budget,
which had three overriding goals. The most important was to meet the critical needs o f the people
of Afghanistan. The next was to ensure that the Budget was based on a disciplined approach to
 governance. Finally, the budget had to move the country towards fiscal sustainability.       The
Budget aimedto do this by fundingimportant new initiatives ineducation, security, and other key
programs and contained overall expenditure growth o f the Operating Budget to 15 percent over
the 1383 Mid Year Review.With political and institutional structures inplace, structural reforms
need to pave the way for a sound economic environment. Prudent fiscal policy supported by
 sequenced economic reform and improved governance should anchor a sound base.

                                                                                              Annex I
                                                                                          Page 4 of 26



12.     The budget progressively has become the main tool to implement the Government's
development strategy and coordinate donor assistance. It consists o f an ordinary budget, which
covers current expenditures and some capital expenditures aimed at quick repairs, and a
development budget, which covers reconstruction projects and some donor-funded recurrent
costs. In 2004, the Government introduced the concept o f a core budget (all funds flowing
through Government accounts) and an external budget (external assistance directly executed by
donors). In2004105, total public expenditures reached 56 percent o f GDP (a quarter were in the
core budget and three quarters in the external budget). The bulk o f ordinary expenditures
(US$560 million) consisted o f wages and salaries in line with the approved budget. Core
development expenditures reached US$269 million. This was much lower than the approved
budget, mostly due to the fact that the budget was approved on a commitment basis, not a cash
basis.

13.     Expenditures in the external budget amounted to US$2.5 billion. While the external
budget is financed exclusively from donor grants, the core budget is financed fkom four sources:
(i) domestic revenues, which reached US$268 million in 2004105 (4.5 percent o f GDP), a 29
percent increase above 2003104; (ii)    donor grants, notably the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust
Fund (ARTF), which finances both ordinary and development expenditures (US$487 million or
8.2 percent o f GDP); (iii) external loans, including the proceeds o f PSIB, which finance the core
budget (US$309 million or 5.2 percent o f GDP); and (iv) changes in cash balance at the central
bank. The debt-to-GDP ratio remains low at 13 percent.

14.     The Government has adopted for the first time in October 2005 a Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework (MTFF). An MTFF typically contains fiscal policy objectives and a set o f integrated
medium term macroeconomics and fiscal targets and projections. The MTFF will allow the
Government to put in place an affordable, realistic and sustainable medium-term fiscal
framework to ensure (i)    transparency in setting fiscal objectives; (ii)  stability in fiscal policy-
making process; and (iii)    efficiency in design and implementation o f fiscal policy. As the I-
ANDs matures from the interim status to its fullest form, the MTFF will ultimately evolve to a
MediumTerm ExpenditureFramework (MTEF). The MTEFwill align the Government's vision
with costs o f priority programs necessary to harness security, empower the vulnerable, create
employment, combat poverty, and enable the private sector to be the engine o f growth.

 15.    The MTFF includes summary projections over 1385-1388 and a description o f the key
underlying assumptions. These assumptions can be summarized as follows:


    0   Revenues are growing with economic growth, inflation, new tax measures, and increase
        incompliance. (i) GDP growthis estimated at around 10percent from 1384to 1387
                             Real
        and 7.5 percent in 1388. (ii)    Inflation falls from an initial rate o f 10 percent in 1384 to
        five percent from 1385 to 1388. (iii) number o f additional revenue mobilization
                                                     A
        measures are added, included G S M license fees in 1384, road toll revenues, increase in
        customs revenue, creation o f an excise tax, and reintroduction o f a land tax. (iv) Tax
        compliance i s assumed to increase to 10% per year. Domestic revenues would largely
        cover operating expenditures in 1388.


    0   The increase incompensation for employees assumes that the size o fthe civil service will
        remain largely stable and that the new pay and grading scheme will be rolled out over
        about 3 years (the level o f this scheme, which i s still to be finalized, i s assumed to be
        close to the level o f the allowance under the PRRprogram).

                                                                                           Annex I
                                                                                      Page 5 of 26


   0    It is assumed that the salaries of the Afghan National Army are not funded through the
        core budget. However, the Government wants to ensure that within the overall fiscal
        strategy, expenditures could maintain a sustainable medium-term fiscal envelope and,
        given the very limited resources, that these are directed towards the highest priority
        needs. The I A N D S - the overarching strategy for promoting growth, generating wealth,
        reducing poverty and vulnerability, and enhancing security - will identify these high
        priority areas.


    0   Development expenditures are adjusted in 1385 to reflect slow implementation o f the
        budget in 1383 and 1384. Starting in 1385 and over the medium-term, development
        spending rises gradually as it i s assumed that capacity increases over time.


    0   Donor grants are expectedto remainhighthroughout the projections.


    0   The fiscal deficit, which remains large throughout the projections, i s financed only by
        external loans (on a concessional basis) as the Government intends to maintain its no
        overdraft policy.

16.     On fiscal governance, the MoF has embarked on a five-year strategy to modernize the
budget, treasury and revenue mechanisms. A clear, effective, and broadly supported vision will
guide and assist the M o F in identifying,prioritizing, and implementing the wide range o f actions
required for strengthening its functions and capacities, leading to the fiscal and growth outcomes
that Afghanistan requires for its medium-term development. The MoF's vision attempts to closely
linkthe Government's priorities.The mainroles andresponsibilities o fMoFwill include:

    0   Mobilizingrevenue and managing Government finances - especially budget revenue
        and expenditure operations, and the management and control of Government bank
        accounts and cash flows. Giventhe relatively l o w level o f domestic revenue generation in
        Afghanistan, mobilizing progressively more revenue over time will be a key priority for
        the MoF.


    0   Supporting economic management and promoting economic growth - most
        importantly the provision of policy analysis and advice on a range o f economic policies
        and strategies, especially from the fiscal standpoint, with particular emphasis on
        supporting inclusive economic growth and development.


     0  Managing public wealth - managing and advising the Government as a whole on issues
        involvingthe assets and liabilities o f the Government, including a clear focus on policies
        and measures for achieving sustained improvements inpublic sector assets and liabilities.


     0  Promoting good governance          - acting as the chief custodian o f the public financial
        management system, combating corruption, ensuring and enhancing financial system
        integrity, and providing the leading policy and technical inputs for public finance laws,
        regulations, procedures, accountability structures, fiscal transparency, and quality
         assurance practices o fpublic institutions.

 17.     The M o F has achieved significant improvements in the area o f Public Finance
Management (PFM). First, the budget has gradually become a policy instrument and i s used to
allocate funds to Government's highest priorities. The Government has maintained its
commitment to budget transparency, and an increasing number o f reports are publicly available.

                                                                                             Annex 1
                                                                                        Page 6 of 26

The implementation of the Public Finance and Expenditure Management (PFEM) law - which
was gazetted in June 2005 - will support the endeavors in public finance reform. Second, with
respect to budget execution and fiduciary controls, the Government has implemented a
centralized computerized system, the Afghanistan Financial Management Information System
(AFMIS), to issue checks and record revenues and expenditures o f the ordinary and development
budgets. Parallel improvements have been made in the DAB payment systems. The system o f
Treasury Single Account (TSA) ensures strong fiduciary controls (including regular sweeping o f
revenues to the center and bank reconciliations). As a result o f these reforms, the Government has
been improving its performance relative to the fiduciary standards that ARTF set to reimburse
Government expenditures. Third, with respect to procurement, the Government has passed in
September 2005 the Procurement Law, which will ensure a due and a transparent process.

18.      The establishment o f a Fiscal Policy Unit, a Fiscal Coordination Committee, a taxpayers
register, and a cash management unit, together with the gazetting amended revenue act,
finalization o f a revenue modernization action plan, preparation o f an inventory o f existing taxes,
implementation o f Mustofiats reforms, development o f chart o f account compatible with
Government Finance Statistics (GFS), and initiation o f an awareness-raising campaign for
targeted tax payers are the most recent steps taken by the MoF. The planned Fiscal Bulletin will
bolster transparency. The integration o f operating and development budgets will be a major step
towards robust management o fpublic expenditures.

PublicAdministrationReform

19.      The Government has initiated the implementation o f its Public Administration Reform
(PAR) program to strengthen public administration. The size o f the civil service has been kept
under control. The implementation o f the Priority Reformand Restructuring (PRR) program, now
covering more than 15,000 positions, allows administrative departments to place staff on an
elevated pay scale in exchange for organizational restructuring and merit-based staffing. In
addition, about 700 appointments for senior civil servants have been made under merit-based
procedures. The recently approved Civil Service Law provides the basis for institutionalizing
these achievements.

HumanDevelopment

20.      Results have been achieved ineducation (school enrollment has increased from 1million
in 1999to almost 5 million in2005) and health (outpatient visits have tripled over the last year
and massive vaccination campaigns have reduced polio cases), reflecting progress to supply
education and health services (teacher recruitment, school rehabilitation, extension o f the basic
package of health services). Progress has been made to strengthen the Government's monitoring
and evaluation capacity. In health, a baseline evaluation o f health service delivery performance
has been completed in 2004 and i s repeated in2005. In education, a census o f all schools in the
country gathered information on schools and teachers.


PrivateSectorDevelopment

21.      Private sector investment i s takmg place, notably in construction and telecommunications
and mostly in Kabul. Private investment has grown from 1 percent o f GDP in 2002/03 to 4
percent in 2004/05. The legal and regulatory framework for the private sector (including the
financial  sector) has been reviewed and a number o f laws have been drafted to simplify and
modernize it.

                                                                                            Annex I
                                                                                        Page 7 of 26



22.      With respect to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), the Government has made significant
progress in this area. Most SOEs have been surveyed and classified into two groups: those that
might be proposed for divestment and those proposed for restructuring under continued
Government ownership. In addition, proposals have been developed for a social safety net to
protect employees o f the SOEs proposed for divestment.

23.      With respect to the financial sector, significant progress has also been made. The legal
and regulatory framework i s being modernized (see above, notably with the issuance o f 14
commercial banlung prudential regulations) and DAB'Scapacity to supervise the banking sector
i s being strengthened. The modernization o f DAB i s ongoing, notably through the
implementation o f PRR. DAB has published its financial statements for the Fiscal Year 1382.
Finally, 12 banking organizations have been licensed, including 3 state-owned banks and plans
are being developed for the restructuring or liquidation o f the 6 state-owned banks.

                               111. THEGOVERNMENT'S        STRATEGY

24.      The key elements o f the Government's strategy for economic growth and poverty
reduction can broadly be articulated around six areas o f reform. These areas are detailed in the
attached policy matrix.

Afghanistan NationalDevelopmentStrategy

25.      The National Development Strategy i s the Government o f Afghanistan's overarching
strategy for promoting growth, generating wealth and reducing poverty and vulnerability. It will
provide the framework for the development o f Government policies, and guide the allocation o f
resources and programs towards these goals.

26.      The ANDs will be prepared in two phases: (i)         an Interim ANDs (I-ANDs) will be
prepared during2005 and completed toward the end o f 2005; (ii)       a final ANDs i s expected to be
completed in2006. The InterimANDs has four components:

         (1) Strategy: prepare a national strategy for promoting growth and reducing poverty and
         vulnerability that builds on earlier strategies;

         (2) Consultation: ensure consultation among key stakeholders on the Interim ANDs in
         2005, andprepare a plan for a comprehensive participatory process for the final ANDs in
         2006;

         (3) OvercomingObstacles: ensure that the ANDs takes account o f obstacles to it being
         implemented, and suggests solutions; and

         (4) Data: gather and use existing data on the nature and causes o fpoverty, and develop a
         plan for gathering any additional data needed for the final ANDs in2006.

27.      The ANDs will make a difference only if its conclusions inform policy development, the
 allocation o f resources, the reform o f institutions and regulatory frameworks, and the
implementation of programs and projects. By working very closely with colleagues within
 Government at all levels, the ANDs worlung group will help colleagues intheir understanding o f
how the conclusions set out inthe ANDs can be integrated into the way inwhich their ministries

                                                                                       Page 8 of 26

design policies, reform their structures, and prepare and implement their Public Investment
Programs (PIP).

28.     Alignment o f the external budget with the ANDs framework requires that donor, UN,
NGO and InternationalFinancialInstitutionpartners design and implement programs andprojects
in accordance with the priorities set out in the ANDs. Strong and sustained engagement by
partners in the ANDs process i s the best guarantee that the ANDs will be a living document that
achieves its shared goals.

PromotingSecurityandRuleof Law

29.      Security and rule o f law are fundamental prerequisites for political normalization,
national reconciliation, reconstruction, and social development. Inrecognition o f the critical role
of security, the Government has adopted a special Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for its
national development strategy on enhancing security. The reform strategy seeks to address these
challenges. There are plans to train the new Afghan National Police and recruitment o f the
Afghan National Army (ANA) i s ongoing. To improve the judicial system and ensure its
independence, the strategy includes efforts to rebuild the administration o f juvenile justice,
prison, and law enforcement systems.         Among the activities to be carried out are the
establishment o f new courts and the strengtheningo flegal aid services.

MaintainingMacroeconomicStability

30.      Maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework i s a prerequisite for broad-based
economic growth. The Government i s committed to maintaining the implementation o f a
macroeconomic framework based on a strong commitment to fiscal discipline.              Continuing
implementation o f the IMF's Staff Monitored Program (SMP) operation supports the
Government's strategy to implement a stable macroeconomic framework by (i)        providing budget
support to fill a budgetary gap, (ii)supporting an increase in domestic revenues, (iii) supporting
the preparation o f a development strategy, and (iv) supporting the preparation o f a Medium-Term
Fiscal Framework (MTFF).

StrengtheningFiscalManagementandPublicAdministration

31.      This key element of the strategy includes: civil service, administrative capacity, budget
preparation, public sector financial management, procurement, and revenue mobilization and
management. Government i s committed to reinforce its PAR strategy. A major focus o f this work
i s to consolidate fundamental building blocks leading to the creation o f sound institutions and
effective policies to support the implementation o f a sustainable medium-term development
framework. Two key reform initiatives that will lay the foundations for the sustainability o f on
going and future reforms include the strengthening o f fiscal reforms and establishing and
implementinga legal and regulatory framework for a new civil service.

32.      Strengthening fiscal reforms including improving human resources, establishing medium-
term fiscal and budgeting frameworks and developing a public expenditure management system
are essential in order to strengthen the budget as the central instrument o f policy malung (i.e.,
linking the IANDS with the PIPS) to achieve the Government's development priorities.
Improving the functioning o f the civil service through developing and implementing the
legislative and administrative framework including the reform and restructuring o f key agencies,
developing human resource management and determining the rank and grade structure for new

                                                                                            Annex 1
                                                                                        Page 9 of 26

pay and grading system will enhance the absorptive capacity and capability o f the administration
to effectively carry out its mandate.

33.      These reforms will seek to redress the current situation where (i)large proportion o f the
                                                                          a
external budget i s funded directly by donors and executed outside Government budgetary controls
combined with (ii)   weak Government capacity constrains the move towards a more Govemment-
owned policy oriented budget linked to policy priorities including the achievement o f the MDGs.
Inaddition, measures to improve the Government's overall financial management accountability
framework including strengthening o f fiduciary controls will need to be implemented. This, in
turn, would reassure donors to channel moreresources through the Government budget.

34.       Measures will be taken to develop systems and procedures to strengthen fiscal
management and public administration reforms. These measures will complement other
Government reforms including the setting-up o f improved budget and accounting controls. These
reforms with a focus on improving the provision and delivery o f public goods and services in
order to ensure the achievement o f the country's social development objectives will support the
spirit o fthe IANDS.

35.       With respect to public administration, the Government has taken stock o f achievements
and challenges after the implementation o f a series o f reforms since 2002. On this basis, a new
PAR strategy i s beingdevelopedunder five broadpillars:

          1) An administrative reform pillar including the strengthening o f the central government
          machinery, the reform and restructuring o f ministries and agencies and the rolling out o f
          the reform at sub-national level;
          2) A salaries and incentives pillar aiming at establishing a small and well paid civil
          service;
          3) A civil service management pillar aiming at establishing a professional civil service
          regulatedby a modem framework o f laws, clear procedure manuals and ethical standards;
          4) A merit based appointment pillarrequiring transparent merit based selection;
          5) A capacity enhancement pillar including training and skill enhancement, better
          management o f international technical assistance, and adequate use o f short term
          capacity.


EnhancingHumanDevelopment

36.       Buildinghuman capital through the implementation o freforms inhealth, basic education,
and social protectionare key for long-term growth.

37.       The Government will focus on the delivery o f basic education, health and social
protection. The Ministry o f Public Health (MoPH) will expand the Basic Package o f Health
Services (BPHS) services inrural areas not covered by other donors, it will strengthen its capacity
to supervise service delivery, and for the longer term, the Government will define its strategy in
this sector.

38.       While on the quality o f education, the Teacher Education Program (TEP) will be able to
develop national teaching standards. The Government i s committed to reduce provincial and
gender disparities and on secondary education. Plans will be developed to increase the enrollment

                                                                                             Annex 1
                                                                                        Page 10 of 26

rate inthe outer years. For the first time, Government i s allowing private institutions to operate in
Afghanistan. The Government will define its strategy for the sector.

39.     On social protection, first, an evaluation o f the National Solidarity Program (NSP) and an
assessment o f the linkages between Community Development Councils and district-level
administration will be conducted. Second, the National Emergency Employment Program
(NEEP) will continue to provide much needed rural infrastructure and its strategy as a multi-
sectoral rural development program will be reviewed. Third, the Government will clarify its
strategy for the sector.

PromotingPrivate Sector Development

40.     The strategy supports the creation o f an enabling environment for private sector
development through improvement in the investment climate, provision o f infrastructure
including transport, power and telecommunications, financial sector development, state-owned
enterprise restructuring, trade reform, agricultural development, and development o f the oil, gas
and miningsectors.

41.     The Government remains committed to support private-sector led growth. First, on the
issue o f property rights, the Government intends to review and modernize the legal framework
and implement regulations to (i)      ensure clarity and security o f land rights and (ii)   facilitate
secured transactions and bankruptcy through appropriate regulation. Second, a new Business
Organizations Law has been drafted and will be the first building block o f a sound legal and
regulatory framework. Over time, this will be complemented by other legal reforms, notably on
the non-banlung financial sector. Third, a law on land transfer for industrial parks will be
developed and the legal and administrative structure for the industrial parks authority clarified.
Steps would be taken to reform state owned enterprises. Progress will be made to encourage the
expansion o f existing commercial banking activities.

promote competition, the Government i s reviewing the state owned companies. The review will
attempt to align this sector and restructure its operations to promote self-reliance and reduce
dependence. Realigning electricity tariffs towards cost recovery would be a major step in this
arena.

                                                                                           Annex 1
                                                                                      Page 12 of 26

44.     Second, as part o f the PAR strategy, the Government expects to make further progress
towards the preparation o f a Pension Law. It will work on estimating existing pension liabilities
and costing options for new pension scheme including long term projections.

45.     Third, the Government will review strategies in the health and education sectors. With
respect to the health sector, key questions include the modality o f deliveringthe basic package o f
health services and the issue o f financing health services in the medium term. With respect to
education, key questions include the role o f local communities and district and provincial
education departments in school management and the issue o f financing basic education services
inthe mediumterm.
46.     The Government i s strongly committed to achieving this broad development agenda, in
terms o f addressing social and economic development, and poverty reduction inour country. The
Government's existing commitments to meet the Millennium Development Goals, enhance
human rights, strengthen governance systems and address anti-corruption measures indeed
support key cross-sectoral issues. Given the significant progress over four years to achieving our
medium-term objective o f a stable and secure Afghanistan, the Government's commitment to the
reformprocess, has been further strengthened.

           RELATIONSWITH THE INTERNATIONALMONETARY FUND


The International Monetary Fund (IMF) i s currently implementing a Staff-Monitored Program
(SMP). The SMP was initiated in March 2004 and has been extended to September 2006. Five
reviews o f the SMP have been completed.      The fifth review i s available on the web at
ht~://mw.imf.ordexternal/pubs/f~scr/2005/cr0537  1.pdf. The IMF i s expecting to conduct its
sixth SMP review inNovember 2005.

                                                      ANNEX 3
                                              PERFORMANCE OF
                AFGHANISTAN'S PUBLIC FINANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


1.      This annex is the executive summary of the Public Financial Management (PFM)
Performance Assessment for Afghanistan prepared as part o f the Public Finance Management
Review undertaken by the World Bank in close cooperation with the Government o f Afghanistan
and various external partners in 2005.' It i s based on a performance measurement framework
developed by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) partnership program2
which identifies a set o f critical objectives o f a PFM system and a standard set o f high-level P F M
indicators to assess performance against those objectives. The methodology provides a consistent
fi-amework for analysis and a monitoring tool for the Government to manage reform and
demonstrate progress to domestic and international stakeholders.

2.      The situation inAfghanistan has some special features which needto be kept inmindwhen
interpreting the ratings. First, some ratings reflect temporary factors (for instance, untilrecently,
the absence o f a Parliament). Second, some ratings are based on changes made recently, and it i s
still uncertain whether these changes will be sustained.                  Third, the ratings assess the current
situation in which significant external support (both advisory and operational) i s being provided
to the Government; in several areas, this raises sustainability issues as the external support will
have to be reduced over time, especially inrelation to financial management operations.

3.      Public financial management in Afghanistan as depicted through the PFM Performance
Indicators as o f June 2005 i s summarized below, under six critical attributes o f a public financial
management system and i s outlined inthe attachedtable.

Credibility of the budget (Performance Indicators 1-4)
4.      Maintaining fiscal disciplinehas been a key Government priority. While the budget, before
foreign grants, i s always in deficit given the low level o f domestic revenues, over the past three
years the out-turn of the deficit has been below planned levels. Three mechanisms have
contributed to this outcome: (i)          strong progress in revenue mobilization, although as a share of
GDP it remains at well below half o f the level found inother low-income countries; (ii)formal               a
mid-year review process that monitors execution and may adjust the appropriations; and (iii)                         a
strictly appliedno-overdraftpolicy that prohibits central bank financing o f the budget.

5.      Despite continuing improvements in budget processes, the credibility o f the budget i s
hampered by optimistic budget projections, particularly for development expenditures, mainly
attributable to a lack o f realismat the budget formulation stage and limited capacity to implement
the budget. Moreover, the External Budget (accounting for roughly three quarters o f total public
spending in the country) remains effectively outside the Government's control, hrther reducing
the credibility o f the budget. There are two specific issues: (i)              the external budget i s to a large
extent outside the Government's control (and so to that extend cannot be used as an instrument o f
policy); and (ii)the gap between donor commitments reported in the budget and actual

expenditures is large. A detailed analysis shows large deviations between budgeted amounts and
actual out-turns.

Comprehensivenessand transparency of budget information (Performance Indicators 5-10)
6.    The Government i s committed to share budgetary information transparently. The annual
budget for the national government i s impressive, with coverage o f most public spending o f the
general Government sector, whether implemented by the Government or directly by donors. The
budget i s a useful public document relating the expenditures on specific projects to National
Programs. Revenue and expenditure records for the core budget are maintained through the
budget implementation system known as AFMIS (the Afghanistan Financial Management
Information System). Comprehensive reports on budgetary aggregates are producedmonthly and
are now available on the Ministry o f Finance's (MoF) website. This information i s generally
reliable but i s affected by lags inrecordingprovincial operations and weak reconciliation. There
are also uncertainties about the quality o f reported information on the external budget.          In
addition, fiscal risks which could arise from activities in state-owned enterprises and
municipalities are not effectively monitored because the financial information i s unverified and
too limited for fiscal riskmanagement inthese areas.

Policy-based budgeting (Performance Indicators 11-12)
7.     Some progress has been made toward the Government's key objective o f malung the
national budget the central instrument o f policy and reform, but there are still constraints. The
full implications ofpolicy decisions, including for fiscal sustainability, are not taken into account
due to lack o f capacity in Government to develop policy, agree on trade-offs among investments
and recurrent costs, and matchresources with policies. Multi-year planning i s also constrained by
the complexity o f aid coordination. Budgeting for recurrent and investment expenditures i s
carried out separately, raising the fiscal sustainability risks from recurrent cost implications o f
investments. The budget process i s orderly and well understood within the Government, but it
needs to be linked more closely with the Government's strategy; more widely owned politically,
including by Cabinet and the Parliament (when formed); and more reflective o f sector issues with
more engagement by sector agencies, provinces, and civil society.

Predictability and control in budget execution (Performance Indicators 13-21)
8.     Much progress has been made inimproving the implementation o f the budget (inparticular
with respect to the allotment process and cash management), but there is a need to enhance
predictability o f finding for service delivery units. Line departments at the provincial level often
cannot predict with accuracy the funds that will be available to them because o f delays in
communicating with the provincial offices o f the M o F and the complexity o f the allotment
process; this has led to cash rationing at the discretion o f Treasury and the Moustufiats. Many
adjustments are made during the year, in particular through allotment transfers and use o f
contingencies. N o information i s available at the local level (e.g. primary schools) on actual
resources available.

9.     A particular weakness inthe budget execution cycle is related to revenue collection. The
overall system i s not very effective as demonstrated by the large gap between revenues that could
be collected and actual collections. Inaddition, despite some progress with taxpayer registration,
the control framework on the revenue side remains weak.           Nevertheless, clarification o f the
legislation and strengthening o f financial management (banlung arrangements to ensure a steady
flow o f collected revenues to the Treasury Single Account, TSA) have generated some
improvements inrevenueperformance.

                                                                                         Page 3 of 5

10.   Much progress has been in implementing the control framework, as reflected by a
significant increase in the eligibility rate for reimbursements o f expenditures by the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). There i s a division o f duties between the line ministries,
which approve expenditure, and the MoF, which keeps records and makes payments. These
arrangements include external operational support in Treasury and the review by the ARTF
Monitoring Agent. The controls also include effective cash management, allotment control on
budget uses, and reconciliations o f records o f the Treasury and the line ministries. Significant
weaknesses remain however, compounded by the lack o f internal audit to provide feedback on
performance and systems. Further improvements in the internal control framework are needed
both for payroll and non-payroll expenditures and for revenues. The recent approval o f a new
PFEM Law and planned financial regulations will further help strengthening the control
framework.

11. Most procurement at present is carried out under standards agreed with donors.
Procurement carried out under national rules, however, i s subject to an outdated regulatory
framework which lacks an institutional support adequate for effective enforcement. There i s
insufficient competition as the basis for contract awards and no guarantee o f value for money.
The new Procurement Law will address these issues.

Accounting, recording, and reporting (Performance Indicators 22-25)
12.    Considerable improvements have been made in this area. The recording o f expenditures
and revenues has been strengthened by partial computerization o f the AFMIS, notably inthe M o F
(also piloted intwo line ministries). Accountability o f line ministries and the MoF to Cabinet i s
supported by frequent reporting on budget implementation by the Government, but improving
accounting and reporting capacity in line ministries i s required. Significant progress has been
made toward consolidation o f bank accounts under a system o f TSA. However, much remains to
be done to improve standards o f accounting, frequency o f bank reconciliation, and usefulness o f
reporting for line ministries' management.

External scrutiny and audit (Performance Indicators 26-28)
13.    Government accountability generally i s sought through the publication o f audited financial
statements on the state budget and specific donor funds. The Auditor General i s worhng to
international auditing standards with operational support from an audit advisor. However, the
final audit o f the 2003/04 annual statements has not yet been released. Inaddition, the absence o f
a Parliament (before the elections held in September 2005) has limited the extent o f external
scrutiny o f the budget and its performance.

Donor practices (Donor Performance Indicators 1-3)
14.    Donors have mobilized a considerable amount o f support to Afghanistan's budget. In
particular, support to the Government's recurrent budget through the ARTF has been large and
predictable. However, direct budget support still accounts for only a very small percentage o f
total external assistance to Afghanistan, and the proportion o f aid that is managed under national
procedures remains low, with most aid executed by donors through their contractors. Financial
information provided by donors on donor-executed assistance activities, while reasonably
comprehensive, i s subject to delays, usually relates to disbursements rather than actual
expenditures, and may be partial and suffer from inaccuracies and inconsistencies.

Impact on development outcomes
15.    The strengths and weaknesses o f Afghanistan's P F M system as summarized above have an
important impact on the country's development. First, the strong achievements in terms of fiscal
discipline, cash control, and aggregate transparency have contributedto macroeconomic stability,
as well as to sustained external assistance. There i s need for more progress, however, in
broadening the comprehensiveness o f the Core Budget, in addition to efforts to improve the
monitoring o f other fiscal activities, such as State-Owned Enterprises, municipalities, and
external assistance outside the core budget.          Second, weak sector strategies, inadequate
prioritization, and lack o f information on results have made it difficult to allocate resources across
and within sectors appropriately. Third, weaknesses in procurement, insufficient financial data
given to line managers, and initial delays in malung payments outside Kabul have been a
constraint on the efficiency o f public expenditures. These problems, along with difficulties in
getting specific data from donors on expenditures of externally-implemented projects and a lack
o f realism inpublicly available budgetnumbers, have exacerbated the disconnect between public
expectations and actual delivery o f services.

                              MONITORINGAND EVALUATION


This annex describes the methodology to monitor and evaluate the reform agenda supported by the
proposed operation. As indicated in the Program Document, the evaluation o f PSIB I1will largely
focus on process and inputindicators, which themselves can be linked to medium-term outcomes (see
table below). This reflects the nascent but low capacity o f the Government's monitoring capacity.
The framework also includes selected indicators on outcomes and impacts; some o f them are beyond
the Government's control, but are important to monitor in order to evaluate the impact o f the reform
program and adjust it if necessary. The framework also includes a number o f indicators from the
PFMperformance framework (Annex 3): their updatewill require more in-depth analysis.

The framework was discussed with the Government as part as PSlB I1preparation and i s therefore
owned by the Government. The identification o f ministriesand agencies responsible for monitoring
each indicator will increase accountability.  Overall, the framework will contribute to create an
evaluation culture in the Government. The framework was also discussed with other donors in order
to reach a common understanding on priorities and measurement. Technical assistance required for
this monitoring is providedby IMF,IDA,andUSAID inthese areas (see ProgramDocument).
