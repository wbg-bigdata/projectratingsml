                         The project is making progress towards the achievement of its development objectives but has a few significant issues that are yet to be resolved. The project has had substantial
                         participation of beneficiary communities at all stages of the project. Rural accesshas been improved through the secondary and rural road improvements done to date, including
                         pedestrian bridges, periodic maintenance works, and regravelling and paving of road sections in the San Marcos and Huehuetenango project areas. The project has also been
                         successful in building planning and implementation capacity at the local government level (with support for the municipal associations, technical road units, and maintenance

                         committees). The closing date of the project has been extended to September 30, 2013 to enable the satisfactory resolution of a pending resettlement issue in the project. This
                         includes the compensation of affected persons with houses reconstruction, reconstruction of other affected structures including possibilities for alternative compensation in line with
                         Bank policies and guidelines). An update of the Corrective Action Plan (CAP) from April 2011 has been prepared (CAP update of 18th September 2012), and forms part of the aide
                         memoire document attached to this implementation status report. The completion of the secondary road construction both in Huehuetenango and San Marcos also remain high
                         priorities though these can only be completed fully with national financing since project loan proceeds were exhausted due to changes in the design and cost of these works. The
                         Government remains committed to complying with its obligations to ensure a more satisfactory achievement of the project objectives, and to ensure that the full benefits of the project
                         interventions are realized by the project beneficiaries in the two departments of Huehuetenango and San Marcos.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         A project restructuring to accommodate the triggering of the involuntary resettlement safeguard was approved in October 2011. The government had previously issued a Corrective
                         Action Plan dated April 26, 2011 which identifies all measures taken or to be taken to bring the project into compliance on social safeguards. The Bank agreed to the use of loan

                         funds to help finance the costs of some of the outstanding resettlement cases. Given the lack of success with procurement processes launched in December 2011, the Government
                         requested an extension of the closing date to September 30, 2013. This has recently been approved. An update of the Corrective Action Plan was agreed during the last supervision
                         mission (update dated 18th September 2012). The houses reconstruction is a matter of high priority, and efforts are being made to have this activity completed in advance of the
                         revised project closing date. The completion of road sections would be with 100 percent national financing since Bank proceeds have been used up, and the execution will certainly
