 IEGWB Mission: Enhancing development effectiveness through excellence and independence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEGWB annually assesses about 25 percent of
the Bank's lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEGWB staff examine project files and other
documents, interview operational staff, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government,
and other in-country stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and
in local offices as appropriate.
       Each PPAR is subject to internal IEGWB peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. IEGWB incorporates the comments as
relevant. The completed PPAR is then sent to the borrower for review; the borrowers' comments are attached to
the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has been sent to
the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEGWB Rating System
       IEGWB's use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEGWB evaluators all apply the same basic method to
arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion
(additional information is available on the IEGWB website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
       Outcome: The extent to which the operation's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project's
objectives are consistent with the country's current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project's design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project's objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected
outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
       Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
       Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface

This is a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the National Agricultural
Research Project ­Phase II (Cr. 2935-KE) which was approved on January 28, 1997, and
became effective on June 6, 1997. A credit of SDR 27.4 million (US$39.7 million
equivalent) was approved to support the development of Kenya's agricultural research
capacity. The Credit was closed on December 31, 2003 after an 18­month extension with a
cumulative disbursement of US$36.5 million and a total project cost of US$138.7 million.

The PPAR findings are based on an IEG mission that visited Kenya in April/May 2007.
Additional information came from an in-depth review of Kenya's economy­wide and
agriculture sector strategies and performance; project files, including the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR); review of sector studies, including IEG's Country Assistance
Evaluation. Interviews were also held with officials of the Government of Kenya including
the Implementing Agency--the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI)--and other
relevant agencies; Kenya's Development Partners including, multilateral, bilateral and NGOs
and private sector service providers; and the Bank's Regional Staff. The PPAR mission
visited three of KARI's National and Regional Research Centers and met with staff, farmer
organizations and local agricultural officers.

In accordance with standard IEG procedures, a copy of the draft PPAR was sent to the
Borrower for their review and comments. The Borrower did not have any comments.

Summary

Kenya gained its independence in 1963 with an estimated population of about 8.3 million and
today, it has reached 34.3 million. About 46 per cent of Kenyans live below the poverty
threshold and 70 per cent live on 12 per cent of the total land area. Over 85 per cent of the
land is arid and semi-arid. Land degradation is shrinking Kenya's agricultural land. With a
total arable land of 43.6 million ha., Kenya's agricultural land and water resources are
meager and variable in quality. Changing weather patterns and recurrent droughts have
caused food shortages and affected the livelihoods in the dry areas in general and in pastoral
areas in particular.

At independence, Kenya inherited an agricultural production system comprising a small and
highly mechanized estate farming sector and a large subsistence traditional agriculture.
Today agriculture accounts for 27 per cent of GDP and generates 60 per cent of total export
earnings. Eighty per cent of the population is rural and agriculture is the principal source of
livelihood. The overall performance of the agriculture sector in the past two decades has
been weak but is recently showing signs of recovery. In the mid-nineties, low commodity
prices, recurrent droughts, weak governance with minimal accountability coupled with weak
economic and agricultural sector policies resulted in low economic growth in general and the
agricultural sector in particular.

The stated objectives of the National Agricultural Research Project (NARP) Phase II, approved
in 1997, were to contribute to food security, poverty alleviation and environmental protection.
The project would achieve these objectives by raising agricultural productivity and incomes
on a sustained basis through technology generation and dissemination in close cooperation
with farmers and extension agents. The Project would also develop technologies promoting
indigenous knowledge and appropriate for small holders and women. However, given the lack
of specificity of these objectives, this assessment has inferred two overarching objectives
from the key performance indicators in the SAR: i) implementation of priority research
programs and effective dissemination; and ii) enhanced institutional capacity.

The project's overall Project Outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The rating reflects
the substantial rating for relevance and modest rating for efficacy in achieving the project
development objectives. The project's development objectives were relevant to Government
of Kenya's (GOK) poverty and development strategies. A common element in all these
strategy documents is the call for improving Kenya's agricultural productivity as a principal
instrument for reducing rural poverty and promoting food security. Towards this end, the
Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) has made substantial progress in focusing its
research agenda on quick impact-producing technologies. Farmers' agricultural productivity
constraints and national development priorities are driving agricultural research priorities.
The Project's institutional development objective and design were also appropriate and
relevant to the GOK's attempt, and the Bank's strategy, to enhance public sector efficiency.
The project's relevance is equally valid today in supporting the Government's renewed drive
to improve technology dissemination by engaging public, private and other service providers.

KARI's agricultural research network, including its growing collaboration with international
and regional research institutes and the Government's firm commitment to increasing
agricultural productivity, are likely to ensure the further realization of the project's
development outcomes. Thanks to the long-term investment in institutional capacity
strengthening, KARI is a success story. The ongoing IDA-assisted Kenya Agricultural
Productivity Project (Phase I of the Kenya Agricultural Productivity Program) continues to
deepen the reform in "generation, dissemination and adoption of agricultural technology."
Successful implementation of the Program will promote farm level adoption of available
KARI technologies. The overall Risk to Development Outcomes is thus rated moderate.

The Bank's overall performance in assisting the Government in the design of the
project and implementation supervision is rated moderately satisfactory. In the rating,
substantial weight is given to the Bank's role in the design of the institutional enhancement
and in prioritizing the agricultural research agenda in this second project, which offset a
mixed supervision performance.

The Borrower's overall performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The rating
reflects the Government's mixed performance, particularly in terms of delayed counterpart
funding and slow implementation of policy reforms, while KARI's performance as the
implementing agency is rated Satisfactory.

Lessons emerging from the implementation of NARP-Phase II reflect the cumulative impact
of NARP Phase I. The two-phase capacity building of KARI is an exemplary long-term
engagement for the Bank and GOK's Development partners. The following are the key
lessons for both the GOK and the Bank:


    · When the outcome of an operation is contingent upon a parallel program on which the
        project has minimal influence, the risk mitigating measures should be identified at
        appraisal.

    · Long term engagement and appropriate sequencing of external (Bank and other aid
        agencies) assistance are critical to successful institutional capacity building.

    · Establishing partnerships with research organizations and allowing independent
        external evaluation of research institutions' operations, management and performance
        enhance institutional maturity.

    · Adopting a pluralistic approach for the delivery of agricultural services requires the
        parallel placement of complementary input and service delivery institutions.

1.      Background and Context

Overview

1.1     Kenya gained its independence in 1963 with an estimated population of about 8.3
million and today, it has reached 34.3 million. About 46 per cent of Kenyans live below the
poverty threshold and 70 per cent live on 12 per cent of the total land area equivalent to 305
persons per sq. km. Over 85 per cent of the land is arid and semi-arid. Land degradation is
shrinking Kenya's agricultural land. With a total arable land of 43.6 million ha., Kenya's
agricultural land and water resources are meager and variable in quality. Changing weather
patterns and recurrent droughts have caused food shortages and affected the livelihoods in
the dry areas in general and in pastoral areas in particular.

1.2     Kenya enjoyed a decade (1968-1978) of high growth rate following its
                                                   1

independence. From end 1970s to the end of 1980s, the performance of the economy started
a downward trend and in 1991 program aid was suspended. To reboot the economy, in 1993
Kenya embarked on a series of policy reforms including eliminating price controls, lifting
foreign exchange control and import licensing, and privatization of public sector enterprises.
The results were immediate but short-lived. During 1994-96, the average GDP growth rate
was 4 per cent. From 1997 to 2002, Kenya backtracked on the reform agenda and faced two
suspensions of IMF programs and Bank assistance due to noncompliance with agreed
commitments on the management of the economy coupled with the unchecked corrupt
Government practices. With the inauguration of the Kibaki Government, in 2003, the
Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation (ERS) was launched and
established the basis for Kenya's current sustained growth. To assist the GOK's bold
economic, social and governance agenda, the IMF approved a $250 million Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and the aid community pledged US$4.2 billion. In
2004, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda signed the East African Customs Union Agreement
which will further boost growth in all the member states. Today Kenya enjoys an annual
growth rate of over 6 per cent and exports earnings have surpassed the US$ 2 billion mark.
Despite the impressive achievements, Kenya has an unfinished agenda in policy reforms,
addressing inequalities and further deepening of good governance all of which will be critical
for continued growth and poverty reduction.


The Agriculture Sector
1.3     At independence, Kenya inherited an agricultural production system comprising a
small and highly mechanized estate farming sector and a large subsistence traditional
agriculture. Today agriculture accounts for 27 per cent of GDP and generates 60 per cent of
total export earnings. Eighty per cent of the population is rural and agriculture is the principal


1. 1978 was a watershed for Kenya marking the end of Kenyatta Presidency and the accession of President
Daniel Arap Moi who ruled Kenya for 24 years. Although multiparty elections were held in 1992 and 1997, the
2003 election, when President Mwai Kibaki won, is considered as the first free and fair multi-party election in
Kenya.

                                                  2


source of livelihood. The main staple crops--maize, wheat, sorghum, millet and cassava
currently occupy 30 per cent of the total arable land. Maize accounts for 80 per cent of total
cereal land or 38 per cent of total cropped area. It is also the principal food security staple in
the diet of Kenyans. Maize also absorbs nearly a third of total Nitrogenous fertilizer
consumption in Kenya. Despite the availability of several hybrid and drought tolerant seed
varieties, average maize yields remain significantly below potential yields. Neighboring
Uganda is a highly competitive maize producer. However, GOK's continued market
intervention including domestic price support discourages import from Uganda. A success
story in Kenya is the dairy subsector. GOK's proactive support including improved
breeding, access to animal health services and coupled with market availability, milk
production has grown significantly during the past ten years.

1.4     Irrigated agriculture is also limited to about 90,000 ha compared to 540,000 ha. of
potential irrigable land. The arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) which constitute 85 per cent of
the total land area of Kenya is home for poor farmers and pastoralists facing recurrent
weather related risks. The most lucrative agricultural products are horticulture, tea, coffee
and pyrethrum and account for 90 per cent of export earnings. Horticulture is second to
tourism in foreign exchange earnings. Kenya accounts for 31 per cent of EU's floral imports.
Kenya's horticultural products are known for good quality and are widely marketed in
Europe especially during the off seasons.

1.5     The overall performance of the agriculture sector in the past two decades has been
weak but is recently showing signs of recovery. In the mid-nineties, low commodity prices,
recurrent droughts, weak governance with minimal accountability coupled with misguided
economic and agricultural sector policies resulted in low economic growth in general and the
agricultural sector in particular.2 The share of agriculture in GOK's total budget has reached
5.7 per cent, still significantly lower than the target 10 per cent for 2008 agreed at the African
Heads of State Summit in Abuja, Nigeria. Table 1 presents selected sectoral indictors.

Agricultural Development Strategy

1.6     GOK has issued several macro, sectoral and sub-sectoral development strategies. To
mark a new beginning for Kenya, the 2003 ERS charted a far reaching agenda for economic
recovery and assigned an important role for the agriculture sector to promote food security
and poverty reduction. In 2004, the GOK approved the Strategy to Revitalize Agriculture
(SRA) (2004-2014) anchored on the objectives and principles of the ERS, the Kenya Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
SRA calls for a new direction for agriculture by reorienting agriculture as a diversified
productive business enterprise. To support the new direction, macro and sectoral policies
would be realigned and pluralistic service provision that would tap public and private sectors,
NGOs and farmer organizations would be encouraged. Toward this end, GOK has embarked
on a long term agenda to improve agricultural productivity and the necessary agricultural
technology generation and dissemination services. KARI is also implementing its ten-year
(2005-2015) Strategic Plan (SP). The SP is a sequel to NARP-Phase II and incorporates the
policy directions of ERS and SRA.

1.7     The World Bank portfolio in Kenya has a long and checkered history. Since 1997,
OED had rated 14 projects, and of these only one (7 per cent) was rated as having
satisfactory outcome compared to an average satisfactory rating of 71 per cent for the Africa
Region.3 Only one operation (Arid Lands Resource Management Project 2005) was rated
satisfactory outcome out of eight operations assessed since 2000. NARP Phase II is the
second in a series of Bank assistance to Kenya's agricultural research capacity building and
supporting research directions to meet the challenges of agricultural productivity and growth.
In June 2004, the Bank approved the Kenya Agricultural Productivity Project to support the
GOK's three-phase agricultural productivity program. IDA is providing an Adaptable
Program Credit of US$27 million and grant of US$13 million for phase one of the program.


2.      The Project

Project Objectives and Design

2.1     The stated objectives of the project were to contribute to food security, poverty
alleviation and environmental protection. The project would achieve these objectives by
raising agricultural productivity and incomes on a sustained basis through technology
generation and dissemination in close cooperation with farmers and extension agents. The
Project would also develop technologies promoting indigenous knowledge and appropriate for
small holders and women.

2.2     The formulation of the project objectives in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
combines broad goals and specific instruments to achieve intermediate objectives. However,
the project objectives and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) presented in Annex 6 of the


3. Operations Evaluation Department, World Bank, 2004, "The Republic of Kenya Country Assistance
Evaluation".

                                                         4


SAR are largely related to monitoring the implementation of the project components, i.e. the
outputs. The one exception is the "increase in productivity of major crops/livestock/agro
forestry productions systems" as an outcome indicator without specific targets. This
disconnect raises the question of which set of "project objectives" should be assessed? It
also points to the lack of rigor in project processing reviews since the mis-specification of
project development objectives is often flagged at the time of ICRs and PPARs. In this case,
the Task Team, at Mid-Term Review raised the issue and proposed revising the Project's
Development Objectives with a view to targeting the intermediate outputs rather than
claiming to achieve "food security, poverty reduction and environmental protection". The
Task Team's proposal was appropriate. However, Management was concerned about the
long and arduous process of revising Development Objectives, which requires Board
approval. Instead it concluded that the scope of the Development Objectives as described in
the SAR is broad enough to include the intermediate outcomes and did not warrant a formal
revision.4 This Assessment's inferred project objectives are: i) implementation of priority
research programs and effective dissemination; and ii) enhanced institutional capacity. These
encapsulate the output/outcome indicators in Annex 6 of the SAR. KARI has also
undertaken periodic external evaluations and impact assessments which shed some light on
project outputs and intermediate outcomes.


Project Components
2.3      The project was designed as a follow-up to the long term agenda established under
the National Agricultural Research Project which was closed in 1995. NARP-Phase II
focused on three key priority elements.

2.4      Institution Building (US$84.1 million or 46.7 percent of total project cost). This
component was designed to: rationalize KARI's network of National and Regional Research
Centers; strengthen its administrative, management and accounting systems; and improve its
procedures for setting research priorities, budgeting, implementation and dissemination of
results and impact assessment. A critical aspect of the Institution Building component was
the appropriate sizing and skill mix of staff including upgrading of human resources. To
better inform its clients, KARI was also expected to improve its monitoring and evaluation
system (M&E), and establish an integrated management information system (MIS).

2.5      Research Program Implementation (US$88.0 million or 48.9 percent of total
project cost). To support high priority basic and adaptive research programs the project
included research on: i) crop and livestock, ii) natural resource management, iii)
socioeconomics, and iv) biotechnology. The Project was also designed to finance
competitive research grants in collaboration with research institutions and private sector
through the ongoing Agricultural Research Fund (ARF).



4. The Africa Region notes that there was a general consensus to design projects with higher and long term
objectives while recognizing that the projects at hand would only account for intermediate objectives. The
project objectives of the Tanzania Second Agricultural Research Project approved a year after NARP-Phase II
indicates that the Project Objectives were appropriately formulated :" to support the generation of technology to
increase efficiency and productivity of crop and livestock production systems..."

                                                         5


2.6       Seeds Program (US$7.8 million, or 4.4 percent of total project cost). The project
would develop a pilot national seed system for basic, breeder and foundation seeds. The
Project would establish a Foundation Seed Unit and provide access to formal and informal
private sector seed multiplication enterprises and breeders. It was also expected that the
project would continue to promote the liberalization of the seed sub-sector.



3.        Implementation

3.1       As a follow-on operation, KARI had in place an established institutional arrangement
to implement the project. The launching of NARP-Phase II was widely viewed as an attempt
to further deepen KARI's institutional development, enhancement of skills, improving
financial management and focusing on the contribution of research to Kenya's agricultural
development and food security. However, the political climate and Kenya's economic
performance did not render a favorable environment for development activities in general.
The project was appraised in February 1995, approved in January 1997 and declared
effective in June 1997 and was completed in December 2003 after an 18-month extension.
Overall project implementation was satisfactory despite a significant (60 per cent) reduction
in co-financing of research programs. The ICR presents a comprehensive review of the
implementation of the project by component and is largely consistent with the findings of the
Assessment Mission. The PPAR highlights the principal features of the three components
which are critical to the review of project implementation. Table 2 presents the Project's
selected implementation of project components.

Institution Building
3.2       The Institutional Building component was designed to build upon the achievements
made under the 1986 IDA-assisted NARP. In 1997, the KARI network was endowed with
substantial physical infrastructure, equipment, and a cadre of core research scientists and a
large support staff. To transform "KARI into a leaner and more efficient organization", the

                                                  6


project's multi­pronged approach was on adopting a mechanism for planning and prioritizing
research programs, rationalizing the network of research centers and resulting in an
appropriate mix and balance between research and support staff. These measures, coupled
with improved financial, information management, and monitoring and evaluation systems
constituted KARI's institution building agenda. Overall, with few exceptions, KARI has
successfully implemented the various core elements critical for institution building.

3.3    KARI has established a chain of functional scientific committees/fora to: i) set the
national strategic research agenda (the Annual Research Forum); ii) approve research
proposals at the KARI Research Coordination Committees (RCCs); and iii) screen at the
National/Regional Research Centers the research proposals (Center Research Advisory
Committees) (CRACs). The KARI Biennial Science Conference is a major event for KARI
where Kenya's agricultural policy makers, research scientific community, and the private
sector operating in the agriculture sector actively participate. This Conference provides an
opportunity for KARI to receive feedback on its ongoing research activities and to identify
emerging issues for research. A typical Research project Cycle for KARI is presented in
Figure 1.

3.4    Based on KARI's overall strategic research agenda, the NRCs and RRCs, consistent
with their mandates, identify research topics in consultation with various stakeholders in their
designated Districts. The constituents include, the District Agricultural Officers, farmer
groups, and scientists in Universities conducting related research. Technical review meetings
are held in the Centers and culminate with recommendations for approval to the KARI HQ.
Research Coordination Committee (RCC). The weakest link in the Research Project Cycle is
the absence of an in-house-based monitoring and evaluation system. Project progress and
financial reports are regularly submitted to KARI HQ. However such reports are not used for
purposes of evaluation. KARI HQ. recognizes this lacuna and is currently formulating an
M&E System under the IDA-assisted KAPP.

3.5    Another major undertaking was the rationalization of KARI Research Centers (NRCs
and RRCs) and staff size and skill mix. The number of Research Centers remained

                                                      7


unchanged during the life of the Project due to the transfer and merger of Centers. The
decision to maintain the Research Centers was based on the need to assign one NRC or RRC
per mandate area. The RRCs conduct mainly adaptive research programs to address the
agricultural technology constraints of homogeneous "agro-ecological zones and socio-
economic systems" covering several Districts. They are also involved in transfer of
technology and knowledge. NRCs are responsible for basic research and development
programs (RDP) serving as national "specialized and referral programs" for priority
agricultural commodities and topics. During the life of the project two centers were
transferred out of KARI while two other Centers were merged into the KARI network. To
secure ownership of land assigned to KARI, titled lands have increased from six per cent of
total lands under KARI in 1999/2000 to 32 per cent in 2005/2006.

3.6      KARI has also undertaken several steps to further enhance its financial management
and control systems. RRCs and NRCs submit their financial statements monthly to KARI
Hqs. which generates regular financial management reports on budget allocations and
expenditures. Recent reviews have however, identified major weakness in financial
management systems that need to be addressed. On-line links between KARI Hq. and the
RRCs and NRCs and the integration of financial input and research output into functional
management information system are still pending.

Research Program Implementation

3.7      To address the key challenges of increasing agricultural productivity, the focus of
NARP Phase II was high impact adaptive research programs within the framework of
farming systems approach. Toward this end, KARI has generated wide ranging agricultural
productivity enhancing technologies. New seed varieties suitable for varying climatic zones,
animal health research, technologies aimed at managing the fragile natural resources and
promoting soil fertilities, and research in biotechnology for crops an livestock were also
developed. The ARF which was established in 1991 to promote competitive research grants
was also financed under the project. A cross cutting instrument--socio-economic research--
to test the viability of research programs and assess the impact of adopted technologies was
also an integral part of NARP-Phase II albeit with minimal follow-up. KARI's technology
dissemination strategy was dependent on the then prevailing Training and Visit System
(T&V) supported under an IDA-assisted Agricultural Extension Project. In 1998, the T&V
System collapsed in Kenya and the project ended prematurely with unsatisfactory outcomes.5
To overcome the absence of an extension service provider, KARI, in 2000, had to introduce a
new approach known as the Agricultural Technology and Information Response System
(ATIRI).

3.8      In 2005, KARI prepared an inventory of all its completed basic and adaptive research
programs including their adoption status.6 KARI and its predecessor Institutes, dating back
to the 1960s have developed over 750 technologies. Over 80 percent of the technologies
were released since the early 1990s covering the period of NARP Phase I and NARP Phase

II. During the period of NARP Phase II, several RRCs have tested high yielding maize seed
varieties on farmers' fields under varying climatic environments.

3.9     An important element in the research capacity building of KARI was the continued
financing of the ARF. During NARP Phase II, the governance of ARF was made more
independent of KARI to ensure impartiality in the selection process of research grants. An
estimated US$2.6 million was disbursed for about 100 research projects during the period
1998-2003 to external research scientists, Research Institutes and to KARI Scientists in
collaboration with researchers in Universities. Two bilateral aid agencies, USAID and DFID
financed the ARF until 1997 after which the IDA Credit remained the sole source. With the
collapse of the extension service in Kenya in 1998/99, KARI in 2000 introduced ATIRI, the
initiative aimed at: i) promoting the participation of farmers in the identification of research
needs; and ii) dissemination of technologies. This program was successfully implemented in
all the RRCs. Funding for ATIRI was earmarked from the project following the Mid-Term
Review in 2000. ATIRI was launched as a 3-year pilot program and by 2003, the RRCs had
collaborated with 325 Community Based Organizations (CBOs) composed of 15,000
farmers. By 2003, beneficiaries from the ATIRI outreach program reached 38,500 farmers.

Seeds Program

3.10    Shortage of good quality seeds has been and still is a key factor in explaining low
crop yields in Kenya. The Project financed the establishment of KARI Seed Units (KSU)
originally known as the Foundation Seed Unit. The pilot seed program was intended to
produce breeder and foundation seeds for multiplication in collaboration with selected
farmers. The KSUs are housed in five RRCs and produce maize, wheat, sorghum, cowpeas
and other seed varieties on contract with neighboring farmers. In 2005, the KSUs reached a
peak production of 680 tons. To meet the growing demand for affordable maize seed
varieties, the KSUs produce open pollinated varieties (OPVs). These varieties, unlike the
hybrid seed varieties can be re-sown following a crop harvest. The project also promoted
the development of the Kenya seed industry. Policy reforms to liberalize the seed industry
have encouraged the entry of both international seed companies and local entrepreneurs into
Kenya's domestic seed market. Today there are over 50 seed companies operating in Kenya.
Five seed industry development units (SIDU) were also established during the project
implementation period and are linked with about 256 seed multiplication farmers. Figure 2
presents the trend in total domestic seed production and imports. Over 80 per cent of total
seed traded is maize and the Kenya Seed Company, a government parastatal, accounts for 75
per cent of the seed market in Kenya. Despite progress in the production and import of
improved maize seeds, there is a significant unmet demand and, as shown in Figure 2, overall
seed production has risen only marginally.

Project Cost and Financing

3.11                  The total Project Cost was estimated at US$179.9 million comprising contributions
from GOK, bilateral aid agencies, IDA and private sector. Actual Project Cost after an 18-
month extension of the Closing Date of the IDA Credit was US$138.7 million or 77 per cent
of the appraisal estimate. The estimated and actual Project Costs and Financing Sources are
presented in Table 3.

3.12                  The reduced project cost has curtailed the size of the project. It is probable that the
project cost was overestimated especially for the Research Program Implementation. Except
for a few sub-components, the core elements of the project--Institution Building and
Research Program Implementation--did not specify pre-defined quantitative targets. As a

result, the project was flexible depending on the financing envelope. Two factors explain the
actual reduced project cost. First, the project cost was estimated on indicative financing plan
particularly for the bilateral aid agencies. Unlike IDA's contribution, the amount expected
from the bilateral sources was not based on a firm project document. Second, disbursement
from such sources was not strictly to co-finance specific subprojects but a financing pledge to
the overall agreed national agricultural research agenda. As a result the actual co-financing
disbursement was only 35 per cent of the original commitment.                   7


3.13           Despite the slow release of GOK counterpart funds during the initial years of the
project, the credit disbursement rate exceeded the revised schedule until FY2004. However
only 70 per cent of the IDA credit was disbursed by June 2002, the original Credit Closing
date (Figure 3) and required an 18-month extension. The Credit was closed in December
2003 and about US$3.2 million was cancelled. The agreed disbursement arrangement did
not facilitate quick turn around time in the flow of funds. Since KARI did not operate a
Special Account the withdrawal application required several reviews and approvals between
the MOA and MOF. This arrangement slowed down the start-up of projects in the Research
centers.

Monitoring and Evaluation

3.14           In 1995 and again in 2000, KARI had indicated that it would establish a Unit in
Headquarters responsible for M&E. No formal action was taken to establish such a Unit and
instead, KARI instituted a system of quarterly and annual reports as an integral part of
individual research proposals. Under this arrangement, the Assistant Directors from
Headquarters visit the RRCs and NRCs quarterly and submit summary reports to the office of
the Deputy Director.8 The quality of these reports is variable and the focus is more on
monitoring quantitative targets and budget expenditures than on evaluation. These
monitoring reports however are very useful for management to track emerging


7. To be sure, attempts were made to get explanations for the substantial decline of bilateral contributions. Due
to several staff turnovers in both the aid agencies, the reasons are not fully known.

implementation issues and contributed to improved financial management and control.
Recognizing this lacuna, KARI has subjected itself to independent External Programme
Reviews (EPR) in 2003 and 2007 with a mandate to evaluate KARI's institutions and the
entire research cycle from design to dissemination. The 2007 EPR was in progress at the time
of the Assessment Mission. There are also specific subject and project-related reviews such
as the evaluations of the ARF (2001 and 2002) and ATIRI (2006), the Bank's Mid-Term
Review (2000) and other aid agency sponsored reviews. While these reviews and
evaluations generate valuable findings and lessons, the absence of an institution-based M&E
System remains a significant gap in the institutional development of KARI. A key weakness
is the absence of baseline data to monitor the impact of technologies and crop yields. To
address this concern, the FY2004 IDA-assisted KAPP inter alia has a provision for the
establishment of an M&E System. KARI management fully recognizes the need for
formulating a credible M&E System and providing the trained staff to implement the system.
Toward this end, KAPP's assistance is one more opportunity for KARI to design, implement
and utilize an M&E System.


4.      Performance Ratings

4.1     The Staff Appraisal Report in Annex 6 has a series of qualitative and quantitative Key
Performance Indicators labeled as "output, outcome and impact" indicators. However a
scrutiny of the indicators reveals that they are mainly output indicators. To monitor and
evaluate the outcome and impact of agricultural research projects, targets for crop yields or
farm income attributed to the adoption of technologies generated under the project should
have been specifically established. These targets were not specified in the Key Performance
Indicators nor monitored during implementation. In the absence of such indicators, the
Assessment is based on development objectives with intermediate outcomes. Available
internal and external evaluations and the Mission's findings are the bases for assessing the
achievement of the Project's development objectives.

Project Outcome

4.2     The project's overall Project Outcome is rated moderately satisfactory. The rating
reflects the substantial rating for relevance and modest rating for efficacy of the project
development objectives. Since objective (i) is closer to an outcome than objective (ii), after
two national research projects, substantial weight is given to objective (i), including the
dissemination aspect. The ICR had qualified its satisfactory outcome rating by noting in the
text that considering the failure of dissemination the overall outcome is marginally
satisfactory, a rating scale that was not available at the time. Table 4 Summarizes the
Outcome ratings.

                           Overall Project Outcome: Moderately Satisfactory



Relevance of the Project Objectives and Design

4.3     The project's development objectives are relevant to GOK's Poverty Reduction
Strategy (2000), the Strategy for Revitalizing Agriculture (2004), and the Economic
Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment (2003), and the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (2004). A common element in all these strategy documents is the call for improving
Kenya's agricultural productivity as a principal instrument for reducing rural poverty and
promoting food security. Similarly, the design of the project was appropriate and relevant to
meet the project development objectives. NARP-Phase II was designed to shift the
agricultural research agenda toward adaptive research with a view to responding to national
development priorities and farmers' production constraints. Towards this end, KARI has
made substantial progress in focusing its research agenda on quick impact-producing
technologies. Farmers' agricultural productivity constraints and national development
priorities are driving agricultural research priorities. The Project's institutional development
objective and design were also appropriate and relevant to the GOK's attempt and the Bank's
strategy to enhance public sector efficiency. The overall relevance of project objectives and
design is rated Substantial.

Efficacy

4.4     Efficacy of Project Development Objectives is rated Modest. The two-pronged
development objectives are interlinked. To develop technologies aimed at addressing the
farmers' productivity constraints and to facilitate their dissemination requires an institutional
capacity equipped with skilled staff, an appropriate organizational setup, systems and
procedures. Toward this end, the Project has made substantial contributions to the
development of agricultural technologies but failed in showing its impact on productivity
increases. The latter is attributed solely to the failure of the assumed institutional
arrangement for agricultural extension and lack of complementary inputs.

KARI has responded successfully to demands for new technologies suitable to Kenya's
agro-ecological zones but the project's dissemination and increased productivity objectives
were not achieved and is rated Modest: KARI conducted three types of agricultural
research--Strategic, Adaptive and Technology Transfer. Both adaptive and technology
transfer research projects increased significantly since 1995. Figure 4 presents the trend in
the type of research projects.

4.5                 In response to most farmers' productivity constraints, 76 per cent of KARI's research
agenda focused on crops and animal production. In the 2005 "Inventory of Technologies",
KARI documented 754 research outputs dating back to 1960. The distribution of KARI
Innovations by Category is summarized in Table 5. During 1996-2003, the implementation
period of NARP-Phase II, KARI issued 136 technologies covering crops, livestock,
biotechnology, and soil and water resource management.

4.6                 As the ICR correctly pointed out, the numerous research projects conducted in the
NRCs and RRCs are commodity specific--maize, cassava, wheat, sorghum, livestock,
potato--paying limited attention to farming as a system to take into account the interaction of
other activities with the selected commodity­specific research topic. A notable example is
the link between crop and livestock production and the overarching issue of natural resource
management. Such a research strategy could result in optimum farm management practices.
However, two common issues are often cited as to why research project proposals are often
singular rather than multi-dimensional. First, due to the shortage of research scientists, the
fact­finding team developing a research proposal based on feedback from farmers is not

                                                  14


multi-disciplinary but a specialist in crop, animal production or soils. As a result, the
research is narrowed to address a single production constraint. Second, the paucity of
research resources acts as a disincentive for a comprehensive multi-faceted research
proposal. KARI recognizes the sub-optimality of such a research approach and efforts are
being made in the CRACs to address such design shortcomings.

4.7     With respect to the dissemination of new technologies, the collapse of the T&V
System was a major setback for KARI. The project design correctly linked the delivery of
extension services to the then ongoing sector-wide T&V system. Troubles in the T&V
system were deepening during the early years of NARP Phase II. However, the decision to
seek an alternative delivery mechanism was made in 2000 during the Project's Mid-Term
Review. KARI conceived the concept, which was launched as a pilot operation to serve not
only as an extension service but also to promote farmers' participation in the identification
and formulation of adaptive research topics. ATIRI soon became a success story especially
in tapping CBOs as a channel for community participation in all phases of the adaptive
research work. A notable feature of ATIRI is the active participation of women as leaders of
the CBOs.

4.8     In 2003, KARI issued the "Beneficiary Assessment Study Report" prepared by a
group of consultants, on the performance and impact of 13 technologies released under
NARP-Phase II and ATIRI. The Report's main conclusions are that, "...there has been some
successful adoption of the technologies, although coverage beyond centers is somewhat
limited, ATIRI is showing promising results". KARI Kitale has released hybrid Maize seed
­H614 for the high potential areas of Western Kenya and North Rift Valley. The Study
found out that the awareness rate is about 57 per cent, and 47 per cent have adopted the
variety. However, the adoption rate is higher in areas closer to the Kitale RRC compared to
areas further away from the Center. This is partly due to KARI's proactive dissemination
effort using its on farm trials and the Farmers' Field Schools. For all the surveyed districts,
the awareness rates of newly released technologies vary from 15-60 percent and the adoption
rates also fall in the range of 32-56 per cent.9 Despite KARI's commendable effort to
disseminate the technologies developed, maize yields remain low relative to their potential.
Figure 4 presents maize yields for selected districts representing high potential and dry areas
and the national average. Maize yields in the high potential Districts of Kakamega and
Kitale are nearly double those of the predominantly dry areas of Kenya--Machakos and
Embu. However, average maize yields (and current cereal yields more broadly) have
remained stagnant since about 1997.

4.9          Research projects financed under the ARF have also produced good results on
farmers' fields. Productivity gains attributed to ARF released technologies range from 30 per
cent for cow's milk production to 74 per cent for sweet potatoes.10

4.10         KARI is the leading technology generation institution for Kenyan agriculture. The
investment in KARI since NARP-I which continued under NARP Phase II along with
substantial support from various aid agencies and international research organizations, has
resulted in a significant boost to the overall capacity of KARI. KARI is a highly respected
and recognized agricultural research institution in Africa. Its in-house scientific strength, the
relevance of its research which is aligned to national development priorities and sector
strategies, and the various initiatives to link its research with dissemination testify to its
overall success. KARI prides itself having 113-strong PhDs, doubling the target increase
under the project. It has also reduced its support staff significantly from about 3,250 in 1997
to 1,870 in 2006. The current ratio of research (including technical support) staff to
administrative staff is about 1:1.2 which compares favorably with similar research
organizations. One reason for the increase in the number of Research Centers is that in
2004/2005, KARI inherited two Centers--TRC and the Kenya Veterinary Vaccine
Production Center. The evolution of KARI staffing is presented in Figure 5.

4.11          KARI has also enhanced its collaboration with regional and global research
organizations. CGIAR Regional Offices (CIMMYT, ILRI, ICRAF, ICRISAT, ICIPE), and
the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa
(ASARECA), a Regional Organization comprising nine Agricultural Research Institutes in
nine countries in neighboring regions, are KARI's leading partners as well as national
research organizations in Tanzania and Uganda. KARI Katumani has developed "low inputs
drought tolerant maize crop varieties" suitable for semi-arid areas. With funding from
ASARECA, KARI Katumani in collaboration with ICRISAT and other national and regional
organizations has also launched research on adapting to climate change based on providing
access to climate information to farmers and monitoring their farming decisions. 11 The
Mtwapa RRC located on the coast has an ongoing collaboration with the Tanga Research
Center in Tanzania, located across the Kenyan border. They exchange research findings on
crops--maize, cassava and vegetables-- that grow on both sides of the border. KARI has also
increased its outsourcing of research projects e.g. barley breeding, cashew nuts, chemical
testing, soil analytical surveys, etc. The total value of outsourced research has increased
from KSh 0.6 million in 1996/97 to KSh 10.4 million in 2005-06.

4.12          KARI Headquarters, NRCs and RRCs have expanded their Library services with
scientific books, journals and research publications. These facilities have become the
research and reference centers for agricultural research scientists as well as academics.

4.13          KARI has also made substantial progress in streamlining its financial management
and control system. It has developed a strong capacity in project management, and financial
management, control and reporting. In recognition of KARI's in-house capacity, KARI is
responsible for the financial management of the ongoing IDA-assisted Kenya Agricultural
Productivity Project and overall project implementation responsibility for the GEF-assisted
Western Kenya Integrated Ecosystem Management Project.

4.14          KARI has adopted various measures to improve the efficiency of conducting
agricultural research. The Research Project Cycle ensures the selection of high priority and

results­oriented research proposals. Partnering with local and external research
organizations and the use of competitive grants are contributing to KARI's resource
utilization efficiency. KARI has responded successfully to agricultural productivity
constraints through the development of new technologies, seed varieties, animal husbandry
practices, and soil management techniques. However, the return from the adoption of these
recommendations is contingent on factors beyond the control of a research institute. A recent
study12 on the determinants of adoption of new maize varieties in Kenya has shown that the
leading explanatory variables are: access to credit, quantity of fertilizer applied at planting
and contacts with extension. With the introduction of ATIRI, KARI has closed the
dissemination gap, albeit limited in scale. Improving access to credit which also determines
fertilizer application is a sectoral issue on which KARI has little influence. Nevertheless, the
adoption rate of new seed varieties has surpassed the expected rates in the Bank's Staff
Appraisal Report while the incremental yields attained are significantly lower than
projected13.

4.15    While there are areas for improvement, the Project has successfully strengthened the
scientific and management capacities of KARI. The efficacy of the project's overall
institutional objective is rated high.


Efficiency
The efficiency of the project's development objectives have not been rated due to lack of
data. The various evaluations conducted by external evaluators point to the overall
satisfactory performance in trial farms of the technologies generated by KARI and the
improvements in overall research management and efficiency. However, between 1996-1998
and 2004-2006, the average national maize yield increased by a mere12 per cent. With such
modest yield increases coupled with limited adoption of improved farm practices, the return
to investments in maize research would be marginal. However, the successful
implementation of the ongoing agricultural productivity program could be expected to boost
the future adoption of the available agricultural technologies from KARI that would improve
crop yields.


Risk to Development Outcomes

4.16    KARI's agricultural research network, including its growing collaboration with
international and regional research institutes and the Government's firm commitment to
increasing agricultural productivity, would ensure the growing realization of all the project's
development outcomes. KARI's greatest challenge is to broaden its resource base to ease its
heavy reliance on external assistance. The average share of GOK in the total budget of KARI
is about 48 per cent compared to 42 per cent projected at the end of NARP-Phase II.

Notwithstanding the increasing trend in GOK budget allocation, KARI is urging MOA and
MOF to accelerate the timing and actual release of approved budgets. Budgets are generally
released toward mid to end of the budget Quarter and the average actual release is about 85
per cent of the approved budget. Actual budgets which are often lower than approved
budgets and are released late affect the planning and implementation of KARI's annual work
program. Figure 6 presents KARI's Budget Sources.

4.17          KARI has launched various initiatives including cost recovery for its services, co-
financing with other research institutes, and improving its financial management and control
to improve cost effectiveness. To boost these initiatives, KARI needs to develop polices and
action plan hat will generate revenues. The ongoing IDA-assisted Kenya Agricultural
Productivity Project (Phase I of the Kenya Agricultural Productivity Program) continues to
deepen the reform in "generation, dissemination and adoption of agricultural technology."
Specifically, the Project is supporting the establishment of a National Agricultural Research
System (NARS) with a view to promoting a "pluralistic research system, with continued
support for reform of KARI." In recognition of KARI's central role in the Project and its
competence in project implementation, the KAPP Secretariat is located in KARI
Headquarters. Early indications point to satisfactory progress and assure the continued
support to KARI. Such interventions minimize the risk to NARP-Phase II development
outcomes.

4.18          In 2004, the GOK introduced annual Performance Contracts for all public sector
institutions to monitor and evaluate their contracted deliveries. KARI signs its performance
contracts with the MOA. In early 2007, the Performance Contract Steering Committee in the
Office of the President selected MOA for "best performance and service delivery." Among
the constituents of MOA, KARI was recognized as one of the leading best performing
organizations. Thanks to the long-term investment in institutional capacity strengthening,
KARI is indeed a success story. Based on the risk assessments, the overall Risk to
Development Outcomes is rated moderate.

Bank Performance

4.19     The Bank's Performance in assisting the Government in the design of the project
is rated satisfactory. As a sequel to the first NARP, the focus of NARP-Phase II was on
adaptive research and continued support for improving its institutional capacity. In
particular, rationalizing the staff skill-mix, improving the planning and implementation of
research programs, and improving the financial management and control system were the
appropriate areas for Bank support. The Project also addressed issues in the seed sector
which required reforms and a supply response to meet the growing demand for improved
seeds, a key constraint to higher yields. In all these areas, the Bank Team assisted the GOK
and used its convening power to mobilize the support of other aid agencies to collaborate in
assisting the GOK in agricultural research. One area the Bank could have performed better
was in the formulation of the Project's Development Objectives and the selection of related
Performance Indicators. This issue was discussed above in Section 2 under Project
Objectives and Design. Lack of clear articulation of development objectives is appearing as
a generic issue which should be addressed at the time of Project Concept Note (PCN) and
requires management's close scrutiny. A related issue is the Bank's silence in flagging the
imminent collapse of the extension service as one of the project risks.

The Bank's supervision performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank played
a critical role in supervising a project and providing timely and effective assistance to the
implementation of the project during a very challenging period in Kenya's economic
management and performance. Bank Supervision consumed an average of US$130,000 per
annum during the life of the project. This level of spending on supervision is nearly double
the current Bank-wide average allocation for supervision.14 Notwithstanding the high cost
of supervision and the appropriate skill balance, the Bank's supervision performance is
mixed. The mission findings and recommendations were largely process oriented rather
than the technical review of the implementation progress. Even the rating of the Project
Implementation Status did not always reflect performance rating of the key components.
Shortly after the project was declared effective in June 1997, availability and timeliness of
counterpart funding15, and monitoring and evaluation were rated as unsatisfactory. The
unsatisfactory ratings continued until the MTR in November 2000. Despite the lack of
counterpart funds and the inaction on M&E, the overall project implementation status was
rated satisfactory for nearly two years. In 2000, it was clear that the Project was significantly
behind schedule and the MTR correctly recommended project restructuring including the
introduction of ATIRI. During 1999 and 2000, NARP-Phase II was the only ongoing Bank-
assisted operation in the agriculture sector and the Bank Team argued for an extension of the
Credit Closing Date both on project grounds and to continue engaged in the agricultural
sector. The Bank could have been more proactive in advancing the MTR since there were
clear signs that the project was facing serious issues especially in meeting its "dissemination


14. The total lending completion cost of NARP-Phase II is US$1.5 million. For the period FY00-04, Bank-
wide average lending completion costs were US$0.6 million and US$0.7 million for the Africa Region.
15. The Assessment Mission also notes that it is common practice for the Regional and National Research
Centers to receive their Quarterly approved budgets late in the Quarters.

objective" after the collapse of the T&V system and closure of the IDA-assisted Second
National Agricultural Extension Project in 1998. In rating the Bank's overall performance
substantial weight is given to the Bank's role in the design of the institutional enhancement
and in prioritizing the agricultural research agenda in this second project. Overall, the Bank
performance is rated moderately satisfactory.


Borrower Performance

4.20    In February 1996, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on behalf of the Borrower
submitted to the Bank a far reaching Letter of Sectoral Policy (LSP). The LSP outlined the
Government's strategy to address "the sector's main constraint" and the critical role of new
technologies and dissemination to farmers. MOF further indicated that the LSP would be
used to prepare both NARP-Phase II and the Agricultural Sector Investment Project (ASIP).
The latter reached only the Negotiations stage and was later dropped. The GOK had
anticipated the economy to grow at an average of 7 per cent annually between 1996 and 2000
based on 4.4 per cent per annum growth of agriculture during the same period. Neither the
GDP nor the agricultural GDP projected growth rates were attained. Adoption of new
technologies was expected to contribute significantly to the projected growth of agriculture.
The LSP also committed the GOK to a series of policy reforms and specific measures to
promote the efficient development of KARI. Overall, the Borrower's performance in
implementing the agenda described in the LSP is mixed. The institutional restructuring of
the agriculture sector-related ministries remains a work in progress. There are still six
Ministries dealing with the sector, 32 regulatory and commercial parastatals, and 101 pieces
of legislations governing production and marketing of agriculture products.

4.21    GOK remains a key player in the maize market absorbing nearly 50 per cent of the
marketable surplus at artificial prices significantly higher than import parity prices to protect
the domestic maize market. GOK is also intervening marginally in fertilizer imports. With
respect to the reforms in the Seed Industry, GOK has taken steps to promote private sector
participation and a revised National Seed Policy which is currently with the Cabinet for
approval. To alleviate KARI's budgetary limitations, the GOK had also undertaken to
increase the annual recurrent budget by 10 per cent, streamline the flow of resources with a
view to improving the timelines of the quarterly budget releases. Actions on the budget front
are also mixed. Lack of adequate counterpart funds was responsible for the slow start-up of
the project which necessitated an 18-month extension of the Credit Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the shortfalls cited above, GOK is committed to KARI as the country's
flagship agricultural research institution. On balance, the Government's performance is
rated moderately satisfactory.

4.22    KARI is the principal player in the assessment of Implementing Agency's
Performance. KARI's performance is rated Satisfactory. The ATIRI concept is KARI's
own approach which ensured KARI's commitment to disseminating new technologies to
farmers. Without ATIRI, the link between research and farmers (for the formulation of
adaptive research topics and extension) would have remained suspended after the collapse of
the T&V system. KARI is also credited for opening its scientific work and institutional
performance to external evaluators. This is a strong signal of maturity and self-confidence.

                                              21


To be sure, KARI has selectively implemented the recommendations made by the external
evaluators. Recognizing the enormous amount of time KARI management devotes to outside
evaluations and scrutiny, the 2003 External Review Panel called on aid agencies to
coordinate their review of KARI performance to avoid duplications.

4.23    The weakest areas of KARI were the monitoring and evaluation system and
mainstreaming socio-economics in formulating research proposals. During implementation,
attempts to establish a KARI-wide M&E System were not successful and instead a system
for quarterly progress reporting was adopted and was functional. With respect to evaluation,
KARI relied on external evaluations. The ongoing IDA-assisted Kenya Agricultural
Productivity Project is supporting KARI to establish an M&E System. With respect to socio-
economics, several actions were taken to assign trained economists to all the Research
Centers to conduct impact assessment. However, an ex-ante economic analysis of adaptive
research proposals is not widely practiced. Equally critical is the need to demonstrate with
sensitivity analysis the implication of varying agronomic practices and input applications on
expected crop yields. The overall performance of the Borrower is moderately
satisfactory.


5.      Lessons

5.1     Lessons emerging from the implementation of NARP-Phase II also reflect the
cumulative impact of NARP Phase I. The two-phase capacity building of KARI is an
exemplary long-term engagement for the Bank and GOK's Development partners. KARI has
an ample stock of adaptable agricultural technologies--seed varieties, crop and animal
husbandry practices, and soil and land management techniques. This build-up is a result of
strong external support for adaptive research. The immediate challenge is to maximize the
benefits from existing technologies. Competition for public sector resources are growing and
continued reliance on external assistance is equally risky. In allocating scarce budgetary
resources, GOK should critically examine the relative returns from continued adaptive
research and promoting the adoption of existing technologies. This does not suggest a major
shift of resources from research to extension. Efforts are currently underway in Kenya to
diversify research and extension service providers. As a premier agricultural research and
technology network, KARI has the potential new heights with the ongoing support of the
agricultural productivity program which will address the unfinished agenda in research and
reboot the delivery of extension services. The following are the key lessons for both the
GOK and Bank:


i)      When the outcome of an operation is contingent upon a parallel program on
        which the project has minimal influence, the risk mitigating measures should be
        identified at appraisal: NARP Phase II was designed with the assumption that the
        national agricultural extension service would be the principal channel for
        disseminating the technologies generated by KARI. The T& V System was
        collapsing and KARI had no control on the organization, management and
        performance of the extension service. Under the circumstances, both the Borrower
        and the Bank should have allowed for a contingency plan as part of the design of the

                                              22


     project. This was absent and it was only at Mid-Term Review Stage that KARI had
     to establish a new mechanism to disseminate its technology.

ii)  Long term engagement and appropriate sequencing of external (Bank and other
     aid agencies) assistance and are critical to successful institutional capacity
     building. Although KARI has a long history of scientific research, the sequencing of
     external support starting with the establishment of key organizational and physical
     infrastructure (NARP Phase I) was appropriate. These measures were followed by
     substantial support for results-oriented organizational efficiency measures and
     streamlining structures; aligning research with national and sectoral strategies aimed
     at addressing farmers' productivity constraints; and attaining a balanced skill mix
     (NARP Phase II). This journey continues under the ongoing IDA-assisted KAPP.

iii) Establishing partnerships with research organizations and allowing independent
     external evaluation of research institutions' operations, management and
     performance enhance institutional maturity. This is the hallmark of KARI. Other
     research organizations value KARI's scientific knowledge and reciprocally, KARI
     seeks partnership to fill in-house knowledge gaps. KARI has benefited immensely
     from independent external evaluations. This reflects an openness to new ideas that is
     important for institutional development.

iv)  Adopting a pluralistic approach for the delivery of agricultural services requires
     the parallel placement of complementary input and service delivery institutions.
     Care should be taken in assuming the readiness of new service providers. Lessons
     from the reforms of the 1980s teach us that due to incomplete policy reforms and
     market failures, `the expected service and input providers' may equally fail to step-in
     or delay their full integration in the `pluralistic market' and create delivery gaps. A
     case in point is the failure of the national parallel T&V system which was critical for
     the dissemination of KARI's new agricultural technologies. A good lesson is KARI's
     gradual withdrawal from a number of commercial commodity research areas which
     are handled by growers' associations whose members were strongly supporting the
     transfer of responsibility.
