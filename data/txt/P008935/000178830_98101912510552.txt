I. THE ENERGY SECTOR 1/
A. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Petroleum supply has become a focal point of the economic problems
that Turkey faces today. Indeed, it would be difficult to overemphasize the
critical nature of the problem. The share of crude oil in Turkey's overall
energy requirements has increased sharply over the last two decades from 20
percent in 1960 to 54 percent in 1979. Domestic oil production, which declined
slowly through most of the 1970's, currently accounts for about 17 percent of
Turkey's overall oil requirements of about 17 million tons. While petroleum
imports of $1.4 billion in 1978 absorbed 60 percent of merchandise export
earnings, they were about $2.4 billion in 1979, consuming all merchandise
export earnings.
1.02      Since 1973 the Government has made concerted efforts to reduce the
growth of oil consumption by replacing it with lignite and hydropower for
electricity generation and with coal for process heat in industry. While
these efforts have helped to stem the growth of oil consumption, the potential
for additional petroleum substitution projects is limited. And given the long
implementation periods required for these large-scale projects, even this
limited level of substitution will take place only gradually. The Government's
efforts to augment domestic petroleum production through the introduction of
enhanced oil recovery technology for older oil fields and through intensified
exploration and more rapid development of newer oil fields will be important
elements in Turkey's overall adjustment strategy. However, despite the
measures taken to develop alternative indigenous energy resources and more
recently to reduce demand through pricing and rationing policies, Turkey is
likely to remain heavily dependent on imported oil unless major new discoveries
are made.
B. INDIGENOUS ENERGY RESOURCES
Petroleum
1.03      In 1979, Turkey estimated its proven recoverable petroleum reserves,
at 17 million tons, about one year's consumption at current levels. Gas pro-
duction was practically nonexistent. Section II will discuss the petroleum
subsector in detail.
Coal and Lignite
1.04      Although coal was Turkey's most important energy source in the
immediate post-war period, production has been decreasing for the past twenty
years. In 1978, estimated potential recoverable reserves were about 120
million tons of oil equivalent (TOE) 2/ and possible additional reserves were
about 800 million TOE. Production was 4.1 million tons, or about 2.7 million
1/   Chapters I through IV are essentially identical to those in the staff
appraisal report Turkey: Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Project (No. 3093-TU).
2/   Conversion factors used in deriving oil equivalents are listed in
Annex 1.04.



-2-
TOE, 16 percent of total energy production. Turkey-s lignite reserves are
enormous. Proven reserves are 1.1 billion TOE, and probable reserves are an
additional 0.5 billion TOE. Production in 1978 was about 4.6 million TOE.
However, as indicated in para 1.18, there are substantial institutional and
technical constraints to a rapid expansion in lignite production.
Hydro Electricity
1.05      Turkey's hydro potential is estimated at 145,000 GWh (35 million
TOE per year), of which about half was considered to be economically usable in
1976. In 1978 the generation of 9,400 GWh (2.3 million TOE per year) of hydro
electricity accounted for 14 percent of all energy produced, but because of
imports only 7 percent of energy consumed. Installed capacity is planned to
grow from 2,100 MW in 1979 to 8,100 MW in 1986. However, there are likely to
be substantial shortfalls as project   execution in the past has been poor and
output for the past several years has been unable to meet demand.
Non-commercial Fuels
1.06      Animal and vegetable wastes and wood continue to be important fuel
sources. However, their production has not grown significantly in the past
two decades and their contribution to total energy consumption has declined
from over 50 percent in 1960 to less than 20 percent in 1978.
Other Energy Resources
1.07      Turkey has a rich geothermal potential which has yet to be ade-
quately evaluated. Some fields are being studied, and the first geothermal
power plant (15 MW) is currently under construction to test the technical
feasibility and economic viability of using them for electricity generation.
Uranium reserves amount to about 4,000 tons of yellow cake U308 equivalent,
(a partially refined uranium oxide).  A nuclear power station of 600 MW
is planned for the late 1980's.  Turkey has more than one billion tons of
reserves of bituminous schist, a low grade oil shale, and plans are being
made to use it for generating electricity on at least an experimental basis
by the end of the decade.  About 0.4 million tons per year of asphaltite, a
non-volatile metamorphosis of petroleum with about 60 percent of the energy
content of coal, is currently produced in southeastern Turkey. This repres-
ents about one percent of total energy production.
C.   PATTERNS OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION
1.08      Per capita energy consumption in Turkey increased during 1960-77 at
an average annual rate of 6.7 percent (12.8 percent in 1974-76) compared to
an average annual growth rate of GNP per capita of 4.1 percent. However, per
capita consumption of 495 kg of oil equivalent in 1976 remained below the
average of 611 kg for 55.middle income countries. Energy consumption per
dollar of GDP rose from 0.3 kg in 1960 to 0.5 kg in 1976, but again was below
average for middle income countries.



-3-
1.09      The most important trends in the energy use pattern since 1960 have
been the increasing share of petroleum, which now accounts for over half of
total energy consumption, and the decreasing share of hard coal and non-
commercial fuels (see Annex 1.02). Because of the importance of imported
crude oil in meeting Turkey's commercial energy needs, the sharp increases in
international crude oil prices since 1973 have seriously impaired the country's
foreign trade position. With domestic petroleum prices controlled at levels
well below international levels until late 1977, the volume of petroleum
imports grew rapidly: from 1973 to 1977 the average increase was 13.0 percent,
well above the real growth rates of both GDP (7.2 percent) and total merchan-
dise imports (8.7 percent). The onset of a severe economic recession, the
sharp upward adjustments made to petroleum product prices since late 1977
and a scarcity of foreign exchange caused imports to fall slightly in 1978
and 1979.

1.10      Rapidly rising energy prices and physical constraints on petroleum,
electricity and coal availability will most probably keep the elasticity of
consumption of energy with respect to income down to 1.0 or less through 1985.
While GDP is projected by the Bank to grow by about four to five percent per
year, petroleum imports are expected to remain stable at a little over 14
million tons per year, reflecting the impact of higher petroleum prices on
Turkey's balance of payments. As a result, total.energy growth during this
period should be no more than four to five percent per year, with lignite and
coal production growing relatively faster than other primary energy sources
(about 12 percent per year) in order to fill the petroleum import gap.

D. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
1.11      The indigenous energy resources of Turkey and their development
have been placed under government control by a series of laws dating back to
1935.  In that year Etibank was established as the state-owned company for
mining and power development. The Petroleum Law of Turkey (# 6326) of March 7,
1954, which is modeled closely after United States petroleum laws, set up
definitions, procedures and government institutions to regulate exploitation
of petroleum resources. It has been modified by Government decrees several
times since, particularly by Decree 2u which changed the method of determining
the price of domestically produced oil. On the same date the Turkish Petroleum
Company (TPAO) was organized as a parastatal enterprise subject to private
sector law and was given the responsibility for exploring for, producing,
importing, refining, transporting and marketing oil. TPAO will be described
fully in Section III. The Turkish Atomic Energy Commission (AEK) was set up
in 1956 for nuclear energy research and development.
1.12      The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) was established
in 1964 to coordinate all energy-related agencies, the most important of which
are described here. The main responsibilities of the General Directorate of
Petroleum Affairs (GDPA) are to approve and register petroleum concessions,
to collect information on concessions that are returned to the State, to
ensure that operating companies conform to good petroleum industry practices,
to determine crude oil prices on the basis of the formula set out in Decree 20,
to monitor the Decree 20 Fund, to help set refinery margins and ex-refinery
prices, and, in general, to implement the articles of the Petroleum Law. The
Mineral Exploration and Research Institute (MTA) explores for minerals, coal,
lignite, uranium, and geothermal energy in coordination with Etibank and the
Turkish Coal Enterprises (TKI). TKI is charged with developing and marketing
Turkey's coal and lignite resources. Since most of its output is used for
power generation, TKI's development plans are closely linked with those of the
Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK). TEK is the agency responsible for plan-
ning the general electrification of the country and for generating, distribu-
ting and selling electricity to municipal power distributors and other large
customers. Petrol Ofisi is the state economic enterprise that distributes and
retails most of the products refined and imported by TPAO.
E. ENERGY SECTOR POLICIES AND PLANNING
Pricing
1.13      The policy of keeping domestic energy prices well below world
price levels after 1973 led to several adverse developments for the Turkish
economy. The low wellhead prices offered for domestic petroleum production
became a major deterrent to exploration and development by international oil
companies. At the same time the policy of holding domestic petroleum product
prices constant in local currency terms in the face of accelerating domestic
inflation and rising world prices for energy led to rapidly increasing demand
for petroleum and rapidly increasing imports (for specific petroleum product
prices, see para 2.24). Similarly, prices for hard coal, lignite and elec-
tricity, the other major primary energy sources for Turkey, were also held
down, causing serious financial losses to TKI and marginal profits to TEK,
and discouraging the adoption of effective conservation measures in both



production and consumption. It was not until the financial and political
crises of late 1979 and early 1980 that the policy of large scale energy
subsidies was largely abandoned and most prices raised to international
levels. Para 2.24 describes petroleum product prices.
Planning
1.14      As part of its preparatory work on the Fourth Five-Year Plan, the
State Planning Organization (SPO) set up in 1976 a working group called the
Special Commission on General Energy and charged it with evaluating Turkey's
energy situation and preparing its long-term energy program. The Fourth Plan
projected an average annual growth rate of energy consumption of 9.6 percent
per year, based on an 8 percent annual growth of GDP. While the recession of
1978 and 1979 and the ensuing revised estimates of Turkish economic growth
have invalidated the demand projections of the plan, and therefore the
investment requirements needed to meet this demand, neither SPO nor the
Ministry of Energy has undertaken to revise the demand and supply projections
since that time. The Government that took office in late 1979 recognized
that the growth and investment targets are unrealistic and was revising the
investment priorities of the Fourth Plan. This work is continuing under the
present Government. A Bank mission to review Turkey's Public Investment
Program is scheduled for November, 1980.
1.15      The Government is also in the process of developing a program for
the conservation of energy resources by encouraging their more efficient use
in existing and new industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and
legislation are being evaluated by both the Ministry of Energy and the SPO,
and legislation has already been passed which allows for tax credits for
various types of investments in energy efficiency improvements. The Government
is also interested in initiating programs to assist industrial firms to learn
how to improve their energy efficiency in existing operations.  The Bank has,
therefore, proposed to include technical assistance for the initiation of
energy audits in selected manufacturing facilities as part of the assistance
to the Government of Turk;;ey under this loan.   This project will be described
in more detail in para. 5.13 of Turkey:  Petroleum Exploration Project. SAR.
1.16      Increasing industrialization could lead to greater dependence on oil
imports by 1985 despite the conservation measures adopted. The government
hopes to counter this trend with the following measures which, it is hoped,
would reduce the amount of oil-generated electricity to 13 percent in 1985
from 45% in 1974: (i) reduce Turkey's reliance on oil imports by expanding
indigenous production of coal and lignite; (ii) convert industrial plants and
domestic space heating facilities from fuel oil to lignite, (iii) develop
further Turkey's hydroelectric power; (iv) step up indigenous exploration for
oil and actively pursue secondary and tertiary enhanced recovery techniques
for existing reserves; and (v) as a long-range goal, develop nuclear power
and utilize indigenous nuclear fuels.



1.17      An increase in production of electricity through a greater use of
hydroelectric power and lignite-fired thermal electric plants will form the
foundation of Turkey-s long-term energy program. The electric power invest-
ment program for 1980 through 1986 includes $4.5 billion for hydro power
plants and $18.5 billion for thermal plants, transmission lines etc. However,
this program appears overly ambitious and will undoubtedly be scaled down
each year to comply with the availability of financial resources, both domestic
and foreign, as has been done in the past. Actual investment in the power
subsector is expected to be about 75 percent of TEK's investment plans,
corresponding to recent experience in the subsector.
1.18      Production of lignite is targeted to increase threefold by 1992,
to 40 percent of total energy production. Most of this increase is to be
used in thermal power plants. The GOT is also pressing for the substitution
of lignite for oil in residential and industrial heating uses. To this goal,
it has directed that construction permits will only be issued for buildings
designed to be heated with lignite, and that the usage of lignite rather
than oil will be one of the criteria for granting investment incentives to
private industrial projects. State Economic Enterprises have also been
enlisted into this effort and have been directed to convert from oil to
lignite wherever feasible. In addition to the Government incentives and
directives, another powerful force in encouraging this shift will be the
increase in the prices of fuel oil and the inability to guarantee industrial
consumers a continuous source of supply. However, Turkey will need to
improve its overall planning, investment coordination, and investment imple-
mentation performance if it is to reach this goal. Already the Elbistan
lignite mine and power project, one of Turkey's major lignite-using projects
(partially financed by Bank Loan No. 1023-TU) has been delayed at least three
years by a series of problems, including ones related to poor management,
staffing, and intragovernmental coordination, as well as shortage of domestic
funds.
1.19      As a part of the Bank-s continuing dialogue with the Government on
energy development strategy and policy in connection with energy related
lending to Turkey, the Government would continue to keep the Bank informed
on all major developments in the energy sector and would discuss its energy
related activities with the Bank. An energy sector review mission is scheduled
for FY81.
II. THE PETROLEUM SECTOR
A. INTRODUCTION
2.01      The most recent estimates put Turkey's proven reserves 1/ at about
17 million tons, which represent barely one year's consumption. However, the
heavy oil recovery technology being tested in the proposed project could, if
completely successful, triple these reserves.

2.02      Turkish petroleum production reached a peak of 3.6 million tons
in 1969 and declined slowly to about 2.7 million tons in 1978. Imports,
however, rose at a fairly steady 20 percent per year, from 3.8 million tons
in 1970 to a peak of about 14.3 million tons in 1977, after which they
declined slightly as foreign exchange constraints limited Turkey's import
capabilities. As a result, Turkey produces only about 17 percent of the
petroleum it consumes today, down from 47 percent in 1970 as shown below:

Total apparent consumption              7.66    10.03    12.15   15.12   17.08
Production is expected to remain fairly stable over the next two years as an
extension to the Raman field comes on-stream, and then to decrease by about 15
percent per year if there are no additions to recoverable reserves. Large-
scale enhanced recovery projects involving the two major fields (Raman and
Bati Raman), are expected to reverse this decline.
2.03      Due to a number of factors discussed in the following paragraphs,
the Government has in recent years relied almost exclusively on the national
oil company, TPAO, for discovering new oil reserves. However, TPAO's efforts
have been only moderately successful. The Government realizes that it does
not have sufficient funds to implement an exploration program of the magni-
tude required to begin solving Turkey;s oil import related foreign exchange
problems. To help alleviate this problem, it has reversed long-standing
policies which discouraged exploration activity and is now actively encouraging
foreign firms to renew their explorat-ion efforts.
B. PETROLEUM RESOURCES
Geology
2.04      Almost half of Turkey's land area of 780,000 sq km is comprised of
sedimentary basins with petroleum potential.  In addition, there are 500,000
sq km of offshore sedimentary basins with petroleum prospects. Since the
Raman oilfield was discovered in 1940, some 600 exploratory wells have been
drilled, over 500 of which were in southeastern Turkey. The petroleum geology
of Turkey is complex and the only oil producing areas are in the south and
southeast. Exploration drilling has been concentrated for the most part on
testing large anticlinal or dome structures, despite the fact that there is
evidence to suggest that stratigraphic conditions-independent from structural
formations were significhnt factors in creating the oil accumulations dis-
covered so far. Thus, exploration has yielded diminishing returns in recent
years, and despite the existence of large oil fields such as Raman and Bati
Raman, recent discoveries are only small oil accumulations.  However, there is
scope for improving both the success ratio in exploratory drilling and the



- 8 -
size of oil accumulation found by applying modern geophysical survey methods
to detect reef-type stratigraphic traps which may not coincide with the
structural features. While most of the oil found in Turkey to date has been
in rocks of Cretaceous and Jurassic age, TPAO recently discovered a large oil
accumulation (unfortunately of heavy oil) at Camurlu, in older rocks of
Triassic age. This gives an additional exploration objective in deeper
horizons, that have not so far been extensively tested. Finally, offshore
areas, with only 13 wells drilled are as yet essentially untested.
Exploration Activities
2.05      Since the introduction of the Petroleum Law regulating all petroleum
activities by both foreign and domestic companies in Turkey, seventy foreign
companies have taken exploration concessions and 512 exploration wells were
drilled through 1978. The latter part of the 1950's saw the greatest activity
as the companies made their initial evaluation of Turkey's prospects; geo-
physical surveys averaged about 108 crew months per year, 96 of which were
undertaken by foreign companies and 12 by TPAO. The 1960 s saw a slackening
of interest, with a fall in exploration to an average of only 45 crew months,
21 for foreign companies and 24 for TPAO. Only two companies (Shell and
Mobil) made important commercial discoveries. In the three years 1976 through
1978, only two of the seventy-nine exploration wells drilled in Turkey were
foreign ventures. Currently, only one foreign company (Shell) is continuing
even a small exploration program.
2.06      Because of foreign companies- lack of interest in pursuing Turkish
petroleum prospects and the GOT s lack of interest in having foreign companies
explore for Turkish oil, TPAO was allowed to greatly expand the area under its
exploration control. First, the GOT gave TPAO the right to double the number
of concessions 1/ that it could hold in each of the country-s petroleum dis-
tricts, and later it increased the number of petroleum districts by dividing
them almost in half. Consequently, TPAO has almost all of the most promising
exploration concession areas. At the end of 1979, TPAO held 249 exploration
concessions including 6 in partnership with N.V. Turkse Shell. Two other
domestic companies held 15 concessions and the three foreign companies
held 11.
2.07      At the present time, virtually all exploration work is being
carried out by TPAO. However, in response to the new government initiatives
encouraging foreign firms to explore actively in Turkey, (i) between February
and May 1980 eight international oil companies have visited Turkey to reassess
their positions on initiating new exploration activity there; (ii) one large
local investment group (KOC) has taken more than a dozen concession areas and
is actively pursuing the possibility of a joint venture with a small foreign
company; and (iii) in the offshore exploration, TPAO has signed an agreement
with a Swedish company to undertake seismic work in the Bay of Iskenderun
(the far northeast corner of the Mediterranean) with the understanding that if
interesting prospects are located the Company will drill at least two wildcat
wells on the basis of a 70/30 profit sharing after costs.
1/   Each exploration concession covers an area of 50,000 hectares.



-9-
Petroleum Potential
2.08      The best prospects for finding additional oil in Turkey in the
medium term and at relatively modest cost are undoubtedly in southeastern
Turkey, using new exploration concepts and techniques as outlined in 2.04
above. The offshore zones are largely untested. They must be regarded as a
longer term and much higher cost areas that would be more appropriate for
joint venture operations between groups of oil companies, as is usually
the case elsewhere in the world. Other sedimentary basins in Turkey, while
not intensively explored, have yielded only non-commercial shows of oil or
small natural gas accumulations. Since any discovery of crude oil in south-
eastern Turkey could be fed straight into the existing system with minimal
additional investment, the Bank believes that the optimal area in which to
finance petroleum exploration in Turkey is in the southeast, which is already
a proven oil producing province.
Recent Production Trends
2.09      The new discoveries of the sixties led to rising production.  In
1971, Shell produced 1.9 million tons, Mobil 0.4 million tons and TPAO 1.0
million tons. However, production peaked in 1973 at 3.6 million tons. During
the next five years it declined by about 20 percent, and by 1978 production
had fallen to 2.7 million tons. Further declines can be expected if no new
discoveries are made or no enhanced recovery projects are initiated.

2.10      In the ten years 1970 through 1979, twenty-one new fields were
found, with a total oil in place of 120 million tons. However, additional
recoverable reserves were only about 9 million tons because the largest field
(Camurlu), with almost half of the newly found oil in place, contained a heavy
oil with an anticipated primary recovery of less than one percent.
C. DEVELOPMENT PROSPECTS
Production
2.11      Production from TPAO's existing oil fields will continue to decline
to about one-half of the present level by 1985 unless enhanced recovery
programs are initiated. The technology now being introduced for the Bati
1/   Ensan is a local company that purchased a small field from American Oversea
Oil in 1963.



- 10 -
Raman field could increase the field's output from the current level of about
2000 barrels per day (110,000 tons per year) to potentially 55,000 barrels
per day (3 million tons per year) within four years of start up of full field
development (possibly as early as 1987); this represents more than Turkey's
total current production. All of TPAO's major fields have a potential for
increased production from the introduction of enhanced recovery technology.
However, each oilfield will respond differently, and it is therefore difficult
to predict the ultimate potential of these oilfields without field demonstra-
tion tests. Nevertheless, it is clear that Turkey must continue importing
the bulk of its petroleum supplies for the foreseeable future since domestic
production, which now accounts for scarcely 17 percent of consumption, is
unlikely to increase dramatically in the next five years. However, the extent
to which domestic production can decrease Turkey's dependence on imported
crude in the 1990's will depend on the degree of success of exploration
efforts in the early 1980-s and the level of application of EOR technology
to existing oilfields by the late 1980's.
Investment
2.12      Total investment in projects proposed by TPAD between 1980 and
1984 is estimated at about $2.9 billion. The detailed breakdown is shown in
Annex 2.01. Exploration accounts for the largest programed investment, about
$1.5 billion, of which over 50 percent would be in foreign exchange expendi-
tures. Production on the other hand accounts for only $250 million, primarily
because planning for investment in this sector depends on the outcome of the
exploration program. The expansion of the company's drilling capacity will
account for $160 million, which is in addition to the $150 million spent in
1978 and 1979 primarily for Romanian drilling rigs. The remainder ($1.3
billion) is for expanding the country's refining capacity.- More than $120
million has already been spent on the'se refinery projects.

this period.



- 11 -
2.13      The continued shortage of foreign exchange is expected to constrain
the growth of petrolum consumption, thereby removing the need for completion
of the Mid-Anatolia refinery and associated pipeline and the second stage of
the Izmir refinery expansion (from 7 to 10 million tons) within the time frame
proposed. For similar reasons TPAO is unlikely to get all the foreign exchange
it would need to fully implement the rest of the program. Since much of the
program depends on the availability of foreign exchange funds it is not possi-
ble to estimate how much of the investment program will actually be implemented
within the proposed time frame. At the time of appraisal (February 1980), the
new Government was only beginning to reorder its investment policies in light
of the country-s new circumstances.
2.14      The Ministry of Energy instituted in June 1980 a special exploration
fund to ensure that domestic financing would be available for carrying out
the expanded exploration program proposed by TPAO and for helping finance the
costs of new joint venture projects that TPAO might initiate with foreign
partners. The financing for the fund is to come fron a tax on the sale
of petroleum products: initially one lira per liter of gasoline and one half
lira per liter of other products. This is expected to generate about $100
million per year. While this fund would be able to provide only local currency
financing initially, it will be an important institut onal structure for
encouraging the expansion of Turkish oil exploration _ctivities.
D.   GOVERNMENT POLICY
2.15      While Government policy in the 1960's and 1970's tended to reduce
the incentives for exploration by foreign companies, in the last few years
important initiatives have been undertaken to reverse this trend. These
include increasing wellhead oil prices to international levels and more
recently, allowing companies to export a third of the new oil produced. In
order to control consumption consumer prices have also been increased to a
level that has eliminated all elements of cross subsidization between products.
Foreign Participation
2.16      Major difficulties began with the promulgation of Decree No. 20
in March 1974, Turkey-s response to rapidly rising world petroleum prices.
This decree fundamentally changed the Petroleum Law of 1954 which until that
time had governed all private sector petroleum exploration, production and
processing activities. Most importantly, Decree 20 fixed the wellhead price
at the December 31, 1973, level of $5.21 per barrel plus verifiable production
cost increases. The difference between this fixed price and the world market
price at which the oil was sold to refineries was deposited to the Decree 20
-Fund, as was any real increase in refining or distributing margins (for
details, see Annex 2.02). In 1977 the Government notified producing companies
that the wellhead price was the Turkish lira equivalent of the $5.21 price of
December 31, 1973 using the exchange rate of that date; moreover, it was the
lira price that was fixed, not the dollar price. With this interpretation,
the devaluation of MarcH 1978 reduced the dollar price to $2.92 per barrel,
and the minimal exploration activity that was being carried out by foreign
companies ceased.



- 12 -
2.17      In April 1979 Decree 20 was modified with a view to making petroleum
exploration production more attractive to foreign companies. The price for old
oil was clearly defined in dollar terms, not lira terms. More importantly, the
price of new oil was set at 75 percent of the landed cost of imported oil.
Since this landed cost included transport to Turkey, customs duties, stamp
taxes, and port charges, the actual wellhead price became slightly higher than
the world market FOB price of equivalent crude. While producing companies are
still seeking certain clarifications in the definitions of the world market
price (and some other minor issues), on the whole they believe that the
changes have eliminated the wellhead price as a pertinent obstacle to future
involvement in the sector. They are particularly encouraged by the amendment
that allows TPAO to negotiate contracts with foreign companies with terms and
conditions that differ from those found in Decree 20, subject only to minis-
terial review and approval.
2.18      The acute shortage of foreign exchange in recent years has proved
an even bigger stumbling block to foreign companies faterested in starting
exploration programs in Turkey. As long as Turkey c(ntinued to have severe
foreign exchange difficulties, foreign companies viewed the prospect of
repatriating profits with justificable concern, particularly since the
Government required that domestic needs be met before exports were allowed.
However, in 1980 the Government adopted a more pragma ic approach to foreign
exploration activities by allowing successful compani :s to export up to 35
percent of their newly discovered oil to cover foreign currency costs. In
addition the GOT appears to be ready to negotiate special conditions on an
ad hoc basis if necessary to induce more foreign exploration investment. In
fact, it has agreed in principle that if foreign exchange costs were above
the 35 percent level, as they most probably would be for offshore projects, it
would be willing to negotiate higher repatriation allowances on a case-by-case
basis.
2.19      In order to attract foreign exploration activity in Turkey, the
Government has decided to reduce the number of concession areas held by TPAO.
The GDPA has been asked to review all the concessions held by TPAO, and to
determine on which TPAO has not fulfilled the required exploration work.
Concessions on which TPAO has not done adequate work, and on which it cannot
convince GDPA that it will undertake such work in the near future, would
revert to the Government and become available for other interested parties.
All available seismic, geological and drilling data for a concession relin-
quished by TPAO must be given to GDPA, greatly expanding the volume of
publicly available exploration information. This should make it easier for a
new foreign company to evaluate the country's geological prospects. The GOT
is also currently discussing retaining a major Wall Street consulting and
investment firm to assist it in developing a strategy for attracting foreign
oil companies. Nevertheless, given Turkey's complex geology, its limited
prospects for finding giant oil fields, and its precarious political and
economic condition, foreign firms are unlikely to move quickly into large new
undertakings.
Price Policy
2.20      Turkish pricing policy for petroleum and petroleum products is
complex since it has been created to achieve a number of independent and
sometimes contradictory goals. Wellhead prices, ex-refinery prices and



- 13 -
consumer prices are all independently set. Crude oil wellhead prices are
set to eliminate excessive windfall profits; ex-refinery product prices are
set to keep gross refinery margins at internationally competitive levels; and
consumer prices are set in order to achieve price stability over the short
term and, more recently, to discourage the growth of consumption. Because
these prices may bear no relationship to one another, a number of intermediate
readjustment steps are required. The machinery for these readjustments is
provided by the Price Stabilization Fund for imported products and products
refined from imported oil, and by the Decree 20 Fund for domestically produced
and processed oil. Annex 2.02 describes the operation of these two funds.
Wellhead Prices
2.21      Crude oil prices for oil from wells on stream before January 1,
1978 remain at the base date (December 31, 1973) price of $5.21 (Saudi Light
equivalent) plus a premium based on the production cost increases since the
base date that can be associated with producing this oil. New oil produced
from wells put on production since January 1, 1980 receives a price about
equal to the CIF cost of imported oil (see para 2.18 for details) 1/.
Refinery Prices
2.22      In order to keep gross refinery margins at internationally competi-
tive levels, crude oil is priced at landed cost while ex-refinery prices are
set by the Government by reference to the international prices for the equiv-
alent products. Since these products are seldom sold on long-term contracts,
their prices are invariably based on spot market quotations. During the
1960-s this system worked well and ensured that domestic refineries would be
internationally price competitive even without actually facing international
competition. It has been less successful in maintaining this goal in recent
years, as the spread between the cost of crude oil imported at long-term
contract prices and the revenue from product sales at spot market prices has
varied widely. In the early 1970's the Government added a system of price
reductions to its product pricing formula to keep refinery margins for each at
predetermined levels depending on the overall operational efficiency of the
refinery. Ex-refinery prices were discounted 2 percent for the Alia (Izmir)
refinery, 8 percent for the IPRAS refinery and 12 percent for the ATAS refinery.
In the mid 1970's when oil prices were generally under downward pressure, the
spread was sufficient to allow a profit for only the most efficient of inter-
national refineries. In fact, during periods when spot crude prices were
below contract prices the spread derived from the formulae in use in Turkey
was insufficient to allow for profits in any refinery. In the last year or so
the situation has been reversed, with spot prices leading contract prices in
an upward direction. This has allowed for exceptionally high refining margins,
particularly since the second half of 1979. As part of its 1980 reform
measures, the Government has decided to eliminate this discount system.
1/   Oil from wells put in production in 1979 received 75 percent of the
import price. When the decree covering 1979 oil was passed, imported oil
was subject to 25 percent stamp tax. This tax was repeated in 1980. The
75 percent price level was designed to eliminate the protection that this
stamp tax and other port charges conferred on domestic production.



- 14 -
Consumer Prices
2.23      Although the GOT has at times been slow in increasing petroleum
prices in response to world oil price increases, its current price structure
is reasonable by international standards. In February 1974, in response to
the sharp increase in crude oil import prices, the GOT doubled the consumer
prices of all major petroleum products and then held them constant in local
currency terms until its financial crisis in late 1977. Since then prices
have been raised several times. Premium gasoline went from TL 2.01 per liter
in 1974 to TL 48.0 per liter in June 1978 ($0.90 per gallon to $2.45 per US
gallon). Diesel and residual heating oil prices were increased only slightly
until January 1980, when they doubled in TL terms. By June further price
increases had brought the retail prices of these products to 40% and 50%
respectively above their FOB Persian/Arabian Gulf spot market prices.
The result is that petroleum products are no longer subsidized, even by
comparison with the high international spot market product prices.

E. BANK ROLE
2.24      Bank involvement in Turkey's petroleum sector has several important
objectives. (i) Given Turkey's limited resources and its urgent need to
increase its domestic petroleum production, the Bank proposes to provide
financing to support efforts to increase production from known fields. The
proposed Raman field development and reservoir study, Bati Raman field carbon
dioxide enhanced recovery field tests, and Thrace gas field confirmation study
are all aimed at this objective. (ii) Given that TPAO will play a central
role in the development of Turkey's petroleum reserves, even though it is
unlikely to secure sufficient funds to explore the country as intensively
as it should be explored, the Bank proposes to support a program to improve
TPAO-s operational efficiency with a technical assistance package aimed at
introducing more modern operational and managerial techniques of the petroleum
industry. (iii) Given the need for a program to greatly reduce the country's
oil import dependence in the longer term, the Bank proposes to support an
exploration program aimed at improving TPAO's capacity to find more oil, and a



- 15 -
technical assistance program for the GDPA aimed at improving the GOT's ability
to attract new foreign oil companies. (iv) As the initial step to developing
a program to increase the efficiency of energy use in industry, the Bank
proposes to provide financing for an industrial energy audit of a selected
group of factories in high energy consuming industries. Details of (i) and
(ii) are described in section V of this report and details of (iii) and (iv)
are described in the SAR,Turkey: Petroleum Exploration Project. Finally, the
project would provide an avenue to develop a dialogue with the Government on
energy policies for petroleum-related activities, particularly in encouraging
additional foreign private investment in high risk exploration activities and
in improving the efficiency of the domestic oil industry.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The GOT established the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO) in 1954
as a specialized organization responsible for undertaking the Republic-s
petroleum activities. While structured as a private joint stock company
operating under the country s commercial law as well as its Petroleum Law
(para. 1.11) it is effectively 93.3 percent owned by the Government 1/ and is
subject to close Government regulation and control. Its annual capital
budget is submitted to the SPO for review and its investment program is
incorporated into the National Budget.
A. OPERATIONS
3.02      TPAO is involved through its own operations and those of its sub-
sidiaries and associated companies in all aspects of the oil business. Its
own activities include exploration, production and refining of oil as well as
transportation of domestic crude, purchasing of imported crude and products
to meet domestic requirements, and some wholesale marketing.
Exploration
3.03      When TPAO was established, it took over responsibility for petroleum
exploration from the MTA, along with the two producing fields that MTA had
already discovered (Raman in 1940 and Garzan in 1950). Past operations are
reviewed in paras 2.05 and 2.06. Its exploration program reached a peak in
1976 when it drilled thirty exploration wells for a total cost of $52 million.
In 1978 exploration drilling had fallen to sixteen wells for-a total cost of
$34 million. In the last few years the scarcity of foreign exchange has
severely hampered TPAO-s exploration operations. Thus, 1977 was the last year
in which TPAO had funds to contract foreign crews for seismic/geophysical
studies; in 1978 only 44 percent of the programmed exploration studies were
1/   65.9 percent by the Treasury, 27.4 percent by the State Retirement Fund,
a fund for public employees, 3.8 by the Army Mutual Aid Fund, and the
rest by various private and government banks, companies and individuals.



- 16 -
completed, and the 1979 program was less than half that of 1978. The staff
of the Exploration Department includes ninety-seven geologists and thirty-
eight geophysicists; 60 percent of the geologists are in the Ankara head-
quarters, with the remaining 40 percent assigned to drilling site and field
activities. Declining real salaries in the past few years has resulted in a
continuous outflow of experienced staff, and although a number of well-
qualified senior staff remain, about half of the staff have less than five
years of work experience. Even the more experienced staff have had only
limited experience outside Turkey and all would benefit from exposure to
explorationists with a wider range of practical experience. This is provided
for in the proposed exploration project.
Production
3.04      TPAO's crude production, which averaged 21,500 b/d (1.1 million tons
per year) in 1979, is concentrated in southeastern Turkey near the border with
Syria. Over half of TPAO's production in 1979 came from two fields, Raman
(9,300 b/d) and Bati Raman (2,000 b/d), with the remainder coming from twenty-
one other smaller fields. Day-to-day operations for the southeastern fields
are handled by the Batman District management.
3.05      The headquarter's office is staffed with 20 engineers who provide
the planning, direction and guidance for developing all oil and gas fields.
In addition, about 220 field technicians work in the Batman district. Senior
technical and management staff are well trained and fully competent in their
jobs, but, again, many middle level staff with five to twelve years experience
have left in the last few years due to a deterioration in the salary levels.
Since many of the more junior staff lack extensive operational experience,
additional training and guidance are needed. The proposed project will help
in financing these requirements.
3.06      The Production Department, like the Drilling Department, has expe-
rienced difficulties in providing the incentives to maintain a high level
of productivity. In accordance with their terms of reference, the technical
consultants reviewing the field activities (see para 5.22) will make sugges-
tions for developing productivity incentives for management and for providing
more flexible overtime and hardship allowance policies for workers so as to
give management more responsibility for its results and the means to obtain
good results.
Drilling
3.07      Drilling has recently been established as a separate department
from the Exploration and Production Department. It currently has thirty-eight
drilling rigs, twenty-two of which were recently purchased from Romania on a
barter contract. Many are still unused since TPAO is unable to obtain the
financing required for drill pipe or operating consumables. In any event, it
is doubtful whether the Exploration and Production Department could provide a
sufficient number of useful drilling locations or whether the Drilling Depart-
ment could train sufficient drilling crews in the next few years to keep most
of the drilling rigs productively engaged. Staffing of the department includes



- 17 -
.3 district managers, 58 drilling engineers, 27 tool pushers and 102 drillers. 1/
About a third of the engineers work in the Ankara headquarters with the rest
in the field; about 80 percent of the field staff are in the Batman district
where eighteen of the operating twenty-two rigs are now active. The field
staff act only, as the operating arm with headquarters maintaining responsibil-
ity for deciding all programming and budgeting questions. The staff appear to
be well qualified for drilling the medium-deep wells that are typically called
for in TPAO's exploration and production drilling program. However, they have
no experience in drilling deep locations through complex or multiple drilling
hazards and would probably wish to have some outside assistance if such a
drilling program was contemplated.
3.08      The Drilling Department must work under the dual handicap of being
a part of a quasi-governmental organization and having to cope with a myriad
of wage regulations which constrain its operational capacity. As a result it
is unable to provide the types of incentives that are essential for obtaining
maximum efficiency; drilling crews tend to avoid taking the risks that are
required to keep productivity rates high and avoid providing the extra effort
needed to resolve problems quickly. Drilling is also plagued by a continual
shortage of spares and consumables which sometimes necessitates using equipment
which was not designed for the job at hand. One good indication of these
difficulties is that on average TPAO's rigs spend an average of only 20
percent of their time actually drilling, compared with a 60 percent drilling
time that an international drilling company would consider acceptable.
Refining
3.09      TPAO management is directly responsible for the operation of two of
Turkey's four refineries. The smallest refinery in the country (1.1 million
tons per year), Batman, is located in the southeast and processes TPAO-s
domestic crude production. Its day-to-day operations are controlled by the
Batman Integrated District (which includes all exploration, production and
refining in the Southeast). The Izmir refinery, with a current capacity
of 3.3 million tons of throughput and a programmed expansion to 7 million
tons, processes imported crude. While the day-to-day operations are run by
the local management, all policy decisions related to purchases of crude,
product mix, and debottlenecking and expansion investment programming are
taken by the refinery group located at the Ankara headquarters. TPAO is also
directly responsible for the construction of the Mid-Anatolia refinery which
will be located about 100 km east of Ankara and for the crude oil pipeline
that will connect the refinery to the port of Dortyol. When the project is
completed (possibly in the mid 1980's) it will have a capacity of 5 million
tons.
3.10      IPRAS (Istanbul Petroleum Refinery Corporation), Turkey's largest
refinery with a capacity of 7.1 million tons, is run as a separate legal
entity with its own Board of Directors and management. Although IPRAS- Board
of Directors includes three members of TPAO's senior management, including
1/   A tool pusher is responsible for all activities related to the work of
a drilling rig, and a driller is responsible for ensuring the smooth
operation of the drilling rig for his shift.



- 18 -
the President of the Board who is currently. the Managing Director of TPAO,
IPRAS- management controls all of its own day-to-day operations. Furthermore,
although TPAO holds 99.98 percent of IPRAS equity, it does not consolidate
its accounts. ATAS, Turkey-s only independent refinery, is owned principally
by Shell, Mobil and BP.
3.11      TPAO-s other important activities are a pipeline operation that
transports crude produced in the southeast to the coast for processing in
other refineries, and a marketing department that is responsible for coor-
dinating the purchase, import, and distribution of all of Turkey's petroleum
and petroleum products imports. In 1978 the marketing department was respon-
sible for importing 10.0 million tons of crude oil (6.3 million tons for IPRAS
and 3.7 million tons for Izmir), and 2.7 million tons of products (principally
diesel oil and fuel oil).
Distribution
3.12      Most of the products from the TPAO group refineries are sold to
Petrol Ofisi, a separate State Economic Enterprise (SEE). Products are also
sold to foreign retailers in Turkey, to two subsidiaries, (ISILITAS), which
distributes fuel oil, and the Cyprus-Turkish Petroleum Company.
Subsidiaries
3.13      With the exception of Petrol Ofisi, TPAO wholly owns or has part
interest in all national companies dealing in petroleum-related activities.
However, even those subsidiaries which are wholly owned by TPAO manage their
affairs independently. Furthermore, since their financial accounts are never
consolidated with those of TPAO only dividend payments show up in TPAO-s
accounts. Annex 3.02 describes the subsidiaries.
B. MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING
3.14      The Council of Ministers controls the majority of appointments
to TPAOVs Board of Directors. Three members are appointed by the Council on
the basis of the Government-s holding of the Class A share which accounts for
51 percent of the subscribed equity. 1/ There is one member from Finance, one
from Energy and one from Commerce. Three other members are appointed at the
annual general meeting, from the holders of Class B stock. Since the Treasury
holds a third of these shares it nominates one of the three, with the other
two being nominated by the private shareholders. The General Manager, also
appointed by the Council of Ministers, automatically becomes the seventh
member and Chairman of the Board. In addition, two non-voting auditors
(nominated by Treasury and Finance) monitor Board Meetings and present yearly
reports on TPAD operations.
3.15      Since the company is organized under the private sector corporate
law, the Board has full responsibility for approving all internal policy
matters. However, TPAO's investment program must be submitted to
1/   Class A stock can only be held by the Government.  Class B stock can
be held by anyone. In all other respects they are identical.



- 19 -
SPO for approval and to the Treasury for funding from official sources.
The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy maintain close contact with
the TPA0 through their representatives on the Board of Directors and through
direct contacts with TPAOs senior management. The company also assists in
the formulation of the Government's energy policy and provides whatever
technical assistance is required for formulating that policy. Nevertheless,
TPAO maintains its position as a private company in competition with all other
potential rivals in the petroleum exploration field. As a result, it is
reticent to make public any exploration information which might be helpful to
its competitors.
3.16      The General Manager of TPA0 is appointed by governmental decree
(approved by Turkey-s Prime Minister, President and all the Ministers) and
cannot be dismissed by the Board of Directors. He is responsible for day-to-
day operational matters, but since he often has only limited petroleum industry-
related experience, he depends upon the advice of the technical staff. A
detailed organization chart is presented in Annex 3.01.
3.17      The Batman district integrates the work of all of the individual
departments of TPAO headquarters. It has 3700 staff members, including about
900 in the Drilling Department, 850 in the Production Department and 500 in
the Refinery. Since it is an integrated operation from exploring for crude
through transporting of products, it has its own manager who reports directly
to the General Manager. Simultaneously, all of the individual local depart-
ments report separately to the headquarters department directors to obtain
approval for their annual operational programs and must request permission for
any changes therein.
3.18      TPAO has some 7000 employees, approximately 3700 in the Batman
district (exploration, field production, and refinery activities), 1700 at
the Izmir refinery, and 900 at its headquarters in Ankara. About 900 people
are professionals with advanced academic training. Wages, salaries, working
conditions and all other .aspects of labor management relations are regulated
by a collective bargaining agreement with the national oil union; only about
190 managerial positions are outside the scope of this collective bargaining
agreement. TPAO is overstaffed, particularly in its refinery operations,
a problem that it shares with most SEE's. Salaries are higher than for
the SEE's because they are geared towards field operations, particularly
drilling, where working conditions are often harsh.
3.19      In recent years salaries for the senior levels of TPAO, including
the technical and management staff, have suffered serious erosion. This
has been due primarily to the custom of unions in Turkey to negotiate for
across-the-board equal wage increases and to prohibit management from giving
additional salary increases on a merit or performance basis. In conjunction
with the recent high inflation rates, this adjustment system has essentially
eliminated meaningful salary differentials.
3.20      This collective bargaining system is almost universally applied
in Turkey today. As a result, this problem of reduced salary differentials
between the least and most skilled jobs, and of reduced real income for the
upper levels of the wage scale has affected government, SEE's and many large



- 20 -
private companies. While TPAO's salaries have remained considerably above
those of other SEE-s, the opportunities for international employment for
personnel with petroleum-related skills have been much greater than for those
with the skills of most other industries. Thus the current differentials
between international and local salaries of over five to one has induced a
large number of TPAO's best-trained professional staff to take jobs abroad.
3.21      While there is little that the Government  as the major stockholder
in TPAO can do to solve the salary problems for employees covered under the
union contracts, it can take steps to ensure that management positions receive
compensation more in line with their responsibilities and their alternative
opportunities. The Board of Directors (consisting primarily of Government
representatives) is currently reviewing management proposals to redefine the
salary structures for senior staff positions and, particularly, to move away
from a parallel compensation policy and consider alternative salary structures
that could provide greater incentives for productivity and efficiency. The
Bank has communicated its concern about the relations'tip between salaries
and staffing and will continue to follow closely the Kovernment-s actions in
this regard. TPAO has agreed to review with the Bank progress made on this
issue, particularly in relation to the consultant's recommendations on improved
efficiency through introduction of incentive policies
3.22      While the staffing problem is quite serious and resignations during
the past two years have greatly reduced the number of middle-level technical
staff with between five and fifteen years operating experience in the explor-
ation and production departments, TPAO's senior management is technically
competent, highly motivated and well qualified to carry out its duties.
Furthermore, TPAO still has a substantial cadre of well-qualified technical
personnel to draw upon to ensure the successful implementation of the Bank
project.
C.   REORGANIZATION OF TPAO
3.23      TPAO   is currently responsible for arranging for the import of and
the payment for all the country-s petroleum products and crude oil require-
ments, for refining a third of the imported crude, and for implementing a
$1,300 million refinery expansion program which will increase its annual
capacity from about 5 million tons to about 15 million tons. In addition, it
is responsible for a rapidly expanding exploration and development program
aimed at decreasing the country's dependence on petroleum imports. The
rapid growth of these two distinct activities within the same management
control system has tended to reduce the efficientsutilization of the manage-
ment resources available to the company.
3.24       Recognizing the management and administrative advantages of
separation of the domestic oil and imported oil-related activities, the
Government has made plans to have TPAO sell the Izmir and Mid-Anatolian
refinery complexes to Istanbul Petrol Refinerisi Anonim Sirketi (IPRAS),
a wholly owned subsidiary that runs a refinery of 5 million-ton capacity
located near Istanbul. The Ministry of Energy will also transfer all
importing of crude and products to IPRAS' account. When its Marketing
Department and refinery operations based on imported crude are transferred



- 21 -
to IPRAS, TPAO would remain solely responsible for exploration, exploitation
and processing of domestic petroleum resources. This reorganization is an
important step for increasing management efficiency and racionalizing
government policy towards the sector. It will: (i) permit greater clarity
in the formulation of objectives of each activity; (ii) facilitate the adoption
of a more rational set of financial and pricing policies for each activity;
and (iii) help avoid potentially harmful cross subsidization of one activity
of the other.
3.25      The Government has agreed to a timetable for the actions necessary
to fully implement the separation before the end of 1982. TPAO shall: (i) by
January 1, 1981, transfer all responsibility with respect to importing and
marketing of imported petroleum and imported petroleum products to IPRAS;
(ii) by July 1, 1981, transfer operational responsibility for all of its
facilities for refining imported oil (including those related to the Mid-
Anatolian refinery) and related properties to IPRAS; and (iii) by December 31,
1981, make all other necessary arrangements to completely separate these acti-
vities.
D. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING
3.26      TPAO operates a commercial accounting system similar to that
adopted by the State Economic Enterprises. Assets are valued at historic
cost, and depreciation rates and depletion allowances are provided in the
Petroleum Law. Financial statements are produced semi-annually, and detailed
management information (concerned mainly with profit and loss information) is
currently being produced experimentally once a month. The system does not
produce unit cost data for production and refining operations, or measure
variances from standard. Financial planning is limited to the preparation of
a budget for the following financial year and compilation of plans for capital
expenditures on a project-by-project basis. No medium- or long-term financial
planning is carried out, nor is it possible under current unsettled conditions.
3.27      Under the technical assistance component of the Bati Ranon project
(para 5.22), a management consultant group would be hired to assist TPAO s
management in modernizing its accounting and management information systems.
The consultants would:
i)   assist in establishing, as of January 1, 1981 accounts showing
separate operating results and financial positions for those
operations to be sold to IPRAS as described in para. 3.20;
ii)   assist in the revaluing, recording, and where necessary appor-
tioning fixed assets and debts existing as of January 1, 1981,
between those operations remaining with TPAO and those to be
sold to IPRAS;
iii)   review the accounting policies of the TPAO domestic group
in relation to current practices in the industry and make
recommendations for improvement as necessary; and
iv)   assist TPAO to introduce more compreherrsive procedures for
financial plan¶ning, and budgeting and for process costing
and management information retrieval systems.
3.28      According to its Articles of Incorporation, TPAO is required to
retain two individual auditors who are responsible to the stockholders for



- 22 -
the examination of the accounting records, and for reporting to the Board each
six months and to the stockholders each year on the balance sheet, profit and
loss account and the company-s compliance with the Turkish Commercial Law.
In addition, the Governmental Auditing Committee (in the office of the Prime
Minister) performs an audit of TPAO and submits its reports to the State
Enterprise Subcommittee of Parliament. In order to strengthen the auditing
process, TPAO will also be audited by the Board of Tax Examiners which has
staff experienced in auditing the accounts of other petroleum companies.
TPAO will provide the Bank with a copy of its audited accounts within six
months of the end of the fiscal year.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF TPAO
A.   Financial Highlights
4.01      This chapter first sets out TPAO-s recent performance on the basis
of its overall operation. It then presents a summary of what TPAO's financial
results are expected to be after the sale of the import-related oil activities
to IPRAS*
4.02      Over the past several years TPAO's major financial problems have
been directly linked to its refining of imported crude oil. These problems
included low refinery margins, exchange losses on short and medium term trade
credits for imported crude, high accounts receivable, primarily due to deficits
of the Price Stabilization Fund that stabilizes the prices of imported products
and products made from imported crude. The transfer of its import-related
refining activities to IPRAS as described in para 3.24 should, therefore, eli-
minate TPAO's major financial difficulties. It will enable TPAO to strengthen
the financial base of its remaining operations and eliminate the effects of
changes in the profitability of imported oil refining activities from its
financial decision-making, and link the financial requirements for its explo-
ration program more closely to its profits from the development of oil fields
discovered during previous exploration activities. The agreed financial con-
ditions include an initial debt equity ratio of 50:50, to allow the restruc-
tured TPAO to start on a sound financial basis, and a debt service coverage of
2.0 to ensure that TPAO would be able to maintain a reasonable balance between
its high risk exploration activities and its low risk production investments.
4.03      In order to ensure that TPAO s exploration and production activities
are not adversely affected by government policy towards other petroleum-related
activities, TPAO has agreed to restrict the use of its cash flow for support-
ing its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Government will also protect the
reorganized TPAO from cash squeeze problems that could be created by an
excessive build-up of accounts receivable. In addition, the Exploration Fund
that the GOT is in the process of establishing should ensure TPAO a secure
source of lira financing for its exploration activities.
B.   Recent Performance (1975 - 1979)
4.04      After several years of profitable operations, TPAO's earnings
deteriorated in the mid-1970-s. In 1976, profits disappeared and in the



- 23 -
following two years increasingly large losses were incurred before pro-
fitability returned in 1979. The two principal reasons for the period of
deteriorated performance were lower refinery margins and substantial foreign
exchange losses. Performance improvement in 1979 was partly due to the
reformulation of the decree governing appropriations to the Fund for Petroleum
Development (the Decree 20 Fund) 1/ under which a larger proportion of the
revenue from products refined from domestic crude was left in the hands of
TPAO and partly due to improved operating results in the imported oil and
refining activities. Earnings in domestic oil-related activities grew to over
50 percent on sales, and accounted for over one-third of the year-s total net
operating income. Positive gross margins were earned on all refinery opera-
tions in 1979 and despite heavy exchange losses and higher interest charges
net operating income rose to TL8.0 billion (US$167 million). Salient features

4.05      Refinery margins allowed to TPAO are the result of government pricing
policies which use East Mediterranean spot market quotations to determine
product prices, and use Mediterranean and Gulf crude oil contract prices to
determine crude costs. As elaborated in para 2.23, through the mid-1970's
the difference between these input and output prices became increasingly
inadequate to cover real costs. In the Izmir refinery, which processes
imported crude, this pricing policy together with increased operating costs
resulted in negative gross operating margins in 1976-78. Operating margins

prices (used for calculating ex-refinery sales) and world contract prices for
crude oil (for calculating pre-refinery crude purchases) allowed for larger
refining margins. Furthermore, the recent elimination of the price discounts
system (described in para 2.22) will bring ex-refinery prices back into line
with international prices and refinery margins back into line with inter-
national refinery margins.
4.06      Foreign exchange losses, which grew increasingly large after 1976,
directly follow from TPAO's responsibility to import virtually all of Turkey's
crude oil requirements. In this capacity it accepted substantial amounts of
foreign debt to pay for this crude during a period when Turkey-s overall
balance of payments position was deteriorating and foreign exchange from more
traditional sources was becoming more difficult to obtain. This massive
foreign exchange exposure in the form of short and medium term trade credits
left TPAO with mounting exchange losses as the Government began its policy
of rapid devaluation to compensate for high inflation rates. In 1977 and 1978
exchange losses eliminated operating profits not only on refining imported
crude but also on domestic crude production. Net non-operating expenses grew
to TL 5.1 billion, including notably TL 1.2 billion in net interest charges
and TL 2.6 billion in losses on exchange in 1979 (see Annex 4.03 for details
of TPAO's financial accounts.
4.07      The GOT has agreed to transfer the responsibility for further ex-
change losses from the account of TPAO to the account of IPRAS by January 1,
1981. The transfer of this exchange burden from the company that is responsi-
ble for the development of domestic oil reserves to the company that is respon-
sible for the processing of imported oil represents a substantial improvement
in the situation for TPAO. In addition to strengthening TPAO's financial
position, it will allow TPAO's profit and loss statement to reflect directly
its success in implementing its exploration and production program. Further-
more, it will eliminate the subsidization of imported oil activities by
domestic oil-producing activities. However, the solution may prove to be only
temporary since IPRAS may not be able to carry the financial burden of these
exchange losses unless a compensation.mechanism is worked out. Nevertheless,
although IPRAS is formally a fully owned subsidiary of TPAO, the accounts of
the two companies are never consolidated, and TPAO's financial responsibility
is limited to its previously paid-in capital. The Government has agreed to
review this issue within the context of its review of the overall financial
structure of IPRAS.
4.08      Investment Program.  The company financed its substantial investment
program in 1976-78 almost entirely by increased short-term financing. However,
in 1979 as its cash flow increased the company financed its investment with
funds provided from operations and long-term debt, rather than with short-term
borrowing. The following table summarizes the flow of funds, which is
described in detail in Annex 4.01:

4.09      Financial Position.  During the period 1976-78 TPAODs financial
position deteriorated significantly. While an improvement in earnings in
1979 has strengthened TPAO's financial position somewhat, it still remains
unsatisfactory, particularly with respect to working capital (see para 4.11).

The debt equity ratio is high. However, since TPAO's tangible assets are
recorded at historical cost, the balance sheet understates the value of fixed
assets and the real equity component of the capitalization. To reflect the
current values of fixed assets in its balance sheet and to set its earnings
in the proper perspective, TPAO needs to revalue its fixed assets. However,
because Turkish law does not permit TPAO to revalue its assets in its books of
account, TPAO has agreed to revalue its assets annually for a memorandum
account outside its prescribed books of account in accordance with principles
satisfactory to the Bank and furnish non-statutory accounts and financial
statements for each fiscal year on such a basis.
4.10      Long-Term Debt.  TPAO s long-term debt has grown more than fourfold
since 1977 (tenfold in nominal TL terms), primarily because of Treasury loans
to meet shortfalls in operations in 1978 and because of increased long-term
credits for crude oil import. Major items of TPAO-s long-term debt (including
the current portion) at year end 1979 are as follows:
Domestic (denominated in TL)        US$ Million   TL Billion a/
Ministry of Finance                131            6.2

except for crude oil (items with. *) debts where 35.7 TL = US$1.0
(12/31/79).
4.11      Working Capital:  During the period 1975-1978 TPAO-s liquidity
deteriorated significantly. While revenues increased threefold in nominal
terms, accounts receivable increased fivefold with the Government agencies and
State Economic Enterprises accounting for a major share of the increased
accounts receivable. To meet a serious liquidity problem, TPAO took extended
credit from suppliers and short-term loans from the Treasury; as a result,
accounts payable increased eightfold, and short-term Treasury loans more than
doubled. Despite the improvement in liquidity during 1979, TPAO s receivables
and payables are still too high, and TPAO continues to have negative working
capital. The major components of accounts receivables are shown below:

4.12      The largest increase was in the liability of the Stabilization Fund,
which now accounts for half of the total receivables. 1/ However, the recent
increases in consumer prices for petroleum products are expected to provide
the Fund with sufficient resources to pay off these obligations, and further
increases in prices will further improve the position of the Stabilization
Fund. Most importantly, the GOT has expressed its intention to continue to
set product prices and taxes to secure for the Stabilization Fund adequate
revenue to meet its obligations. Other components of accounts receivable are
expected to be substantially reduced in the near
1/   The Stabilization Fund is designed to compensate for fluctuations in the
difference between the tax inclusive prices charged by refiners of
imported oil and importers of refined products on the one hand, and the
wholesale prices paid by distributors on the other. When domestic prices
are high relative to international prices, as they usually are for gaso-
line, the Fund receives income; when they are low, as they were for many
years for kerosene and diesel fuel, the Fund pays out. However, the
prices charged by wholesale suppliers change more often than the govern-
ment-set prices paid by retailers. The reason is that importers' sales
prices are based on actual prices for importing products and refiners'
sales prices are based on the calculated lowest cost import prices for
each product based on price quotes in the trade journals. When these
actual and hypothetical prices for imported products rise above domestic
product prices, the resources of the Stabilization Fund fall. As a
result, in periods of rapidly rising world petroleum prices, the Stabi-
lization Fund can go into deficit. Furthermore, since by law the Fund
is outside of the Government budget, its obligations are excluded from
the government sector deficit and it cannot receive funds from the
Treasury to cover its liabilities. When losses continue over an extended
time, as they have for the past several years, the Fund becomes unable
to cover its obligations. The Governnment's current policy of fixing
prices of all products substantially above import parity costs in order
to help restrain demand, and continually requesting prices upward in
excess of devaluation rates should ensure that the Fund will have adequate
balances in the foreseeable future. See Annex 2.02 for further details.

future when the Government completes the latest of its periodic settlements of
accounts between State Economic Enterprises. Therefore, the liquidity problem
is expected to be substantially resolved in the near future. The reconstituted
TPAO could, however, encounter working capital problems if its other accounts
receivable get too large, particularly since it will be unable to balance
these accounts receivable with accounts payable for imported crude, as it is
able to do now. Therefore, in addition to the recently enacted policy of
requiring all SEE's to sell on a cash basis, the GOT has agreed that if TPAO's
accounts receivable become greater than two months sales, it will lend or
cause to be lent to TPAO an amount equal to the excess accounts receivable
at an interest cost equal to that which TPAO receives on its outstanding
accounts receivable. Furthermore, TPAO has agreed to conduct its operations
so that at the beginning of each month after July 1, 1981 it will have liquid
working capital including cash, marketable securities and guaranteed lines
of credit from commercial banks of at least two months estimated operating
expenses.
Future Overall Financial Requirements
4.13      The future overall financial requirements of TPAO in its present
form will depend on the size of its investment program, which is adjusted
on a yearly basis (see para 2.14), on the rate of inflation and devaluation
of the Turkish Lira, on the terms at which funds from the Decree 20 Fund
(Annex 2.02) and the newly proposed Exploration Fund (para 2.15) are provided,
as well as on changes in domestic oil prices and their impact on TPAO's
ability to generate funds internally. An assessment was made of TPAO's over-
all financial requirements and performance under various inflation/devaluation
scenarios, and it was determined that TPAO in its present form would be able
to maintain a self-financing ratio of 45 percent even in the worst case of (i)
an investment program that includes all the projects proposed today and (ii)
the absence of a continued high rate of inflation to reduce TPAO's effective
debt service burden of existing loans. For a more detailed discussion of this
analysis see Annex 4.06.
Financial Prospects of the Reorganized TPAO
4.14      The restructuring of TPAO through the divestiture of the imported
oil activities (IOA) from the domesic oil activities (DOA) as described in
paras. 3.24 and 3.25 will have a far-reaching beneficial impact on TPAO's
financial situation and performance. It will eliminate the source of the
major financial problems of the past few years, particularly those caused by
low refining margins and exchange losses on large foreign exchange debts that
arose from import related activities described in the previous paragraphs.
By eliminating the spurious effects of the changes in the profitability of
imported oil refining activities, TPAO will be able to link the financial
requirements for its exploration program more closely to its profits from
the development of oil fields discovered during previous exploration acti-
vities. The following paragraphs first describe how this separation would
have affected TPAO's financial performance if it had been initiated in 1975.
The impact of the separation on TPAO's future performance is then discussed,
and a set of financial condition that would allow the restructured TPAO to



- 29 -
develop on a-sound financial basis are described. While it is difficult to
foresee the actual financial outcome for the restructured TPAO pending
the decision on how its assets and liabiliies are to be valued and assigned,
the described financial conditions, which have been agreed to by TPAO,
should enable TPAO to maintain a prudent balance between high-risk exploration
activities and low-risk production investments.
4.15      If the proposed change had taken place at the end of 1975 along the
lines now assumed the balanced sheets and income statements of the two com-
panies would have been fundamentally different. Substantially all of the
losses would have been incurred in the IOA. The proforma Estimated Summary
Income Statement for the period 1976-79 would have been as follows:

4.16      If the two operations had been separated earlier the DOA would have
had a satisfactory financial position, with a positive net working capital and
debt:equity ratio of 14:86 as of December 31, 1979. On the other hand, the
IOA would have had serious problems, with no working capital and all equity
capital eroded. However, caution must be used in interpreting these estimated
balance sheets since the division of liabilities between the two branches has
had to be made on a somewhat arbitrary basis, and, as explained in para 4.09
assets are substantially undervalued, particularly those related to refining
operations.



- 31 -
4.17      Since the details of the reorganization and the assignment of
assets and liabilities must still be worked out, the GOT and TPAO have agreed
to the following undertakings in order to ensure that the restructured TPAO
would start on a sound financial basis and would maintain its financial
integrity:
(i) TPAO shall, by April 1, 1981, establish as of January 1,
1981, and thereafter maintain separate accounts and financial
statements with respect to all activities related to domestic
petroleum including exploration, production refining and
distribution on the one hand and all activities related to
imported oil on the other.
(ii) TPAO shall, by September 1, 1981, have revalued its assets of
January 1, 1981, so that they may be assigned, along with
associated liabilities between the two operations retroactive
to January 1, 1981.
(iii) TPAO shall, by July 1, 1981, attain a ratio of its long-term
debt to its equity not greater than 50:50.
(iv) The GOT shall make arrangements to cause TPAO to be provided
with sufficient funds to meet the estimated cost of local
expenditures required for carrying out the project in the
form of equity contributions if TPAO cannot meet these
expenses from its own cash flow.
4.18      To ensure its financial viability, TPAO should maintain a reasonable
balance between its production and exploration investments. Given the high
degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of exploration investment and the long
lead time between the inital investment and the recovery of petroleum, even
when the exploration process is successful, exploration investment should be
financed either from internal funds generated by TPAO's income earning produc-
tion investments or from infusions of additional risk capital. It is there-
fore prudent for TPAO to keep its total debt burden to a level that it can
service while allowing itself a reasonable lattitude to continue exploration
activities with the use of internally generated funds. A debt service ratio
of 2.0 would achieve this objective. TPAO has agreed that:
(i) it shall review annually in October with the Bank its
proposed investments program for the following fiscal year
and its related financing arrangements.
(ii) It shall not incur any long-term debt in any year unless
a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures shows
that its aggregated projected net revenues for each full fiscal
year is at least two times the aggregated projected debt
service requirements.
(iii) It shall ensure that by July 1, 1981 and at all times thereafter,
its current aggregate current liabilities do not exceed its
aggregate current assets.



- 32 -
(iv)  It shall use its internally generated funds only for its
own requirements (and not for the requirements of its subsi-
diaries) unless the Bank agrees that such funds are surplus
to its own requirements.
4.19      It is difficult to predict the financial performance of the restruc-
tured TPAO before the assets and liabilities have actually been assigned to
the new enlarged IPRAS refining subsidiary. However, preliminary calculations
show that the improved refining margins since late 1979 and the higher well-
head crude prices since January, 1980, will make the restructured TPAO a
highly profitable operation. Projections for the period 1980-85 indicate
that if there are no major shifts in government policy with regard to the
Decree 20 Fund and wellhead prices, and if the capital expenditure program for
DOA is implemented as planned, the self-financing ratio will be 55-70%. This
self-financing ratio would be in line with the generally accepted position
that the financing of higher risk petroleum exploration and production invest-
ments, which by their very nature are higher risk investments than are refinery
investments, should be undertaken with a correspondingly higher proportion of
equity sources.
4.20      TPAO's investment program has in recent years been constrained by
severe limitations on the availability of untied foreign exchange, parti-
cularly with respect to drilling consumables and services. While the GOT can
make no commitments on its foreign exchange budget, it is aware of the serious-
ness of the problem and is making every effort possible to provide the resour-
ces necessary to insure that TPAO will be able to carry out its planned
exploration and development programs. Local currency financing is unlikely to
constrain TPAO-s investment program since TPAO is expected to be able to
provide over 50 percent of its investment requirements from its internally
generated cash flow, and should also continue to have access to loans from the
Decree 20 Fund (see Annex 2.02). However, in light of the problems that other
Bank projects are experiencing in obtaining lira funds, particularly during
this current period of stringent monetary restraint, the GOT has further
ensured the availability of lira funds through the recent establishment of an
exploration fund financed by a tax on the sale of petroleum products, which
is expected to generate at least 5 billion lira (about US$80 million) per year
(see para. 2.15).

V. THE PROJECT
A. BACKGROUND
5.01      TPAO owns and operates twenty-four oil fields, of which about
fifteen have very small oil accumulations (recoverable reserves of 300,000
tons or less), as well as two small gas fields. Annex 5.01 provides the
production history and present status of TPAO's oil fields. The Raman and the
Bati Raman fields are the most important fields of TPAO. Raman provided
43 percent of TPAO's annual production for 1979, and Bati Raman contributed
only 14 percent of annual production, although it is the largest oil accumula-
tion so far discovered in Turkey (about 1.75 billion barrels or 270 million
tons of oil in place). Annex 5.02 gives the basic data for these two fields.
The recovery factor by primary techniques for the Bati Raman field is estimated
at between 1.5 and 2.0 percent of the original oil in place. This extremely
low recovery is due to the heavy viscous character of the oil and the absence
of any appreciable driving mechanism (gas or water).
5.02      In early 1978, TPAO requested Bank assistance in developing a
program to increase the ultimate recovery of the Bati Raman oil field through
the use of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology. The application of EOR
methods to heavy oil has received renewed attention in several countries,
especially the USA, Canada and Venezuela, following the increases in petroleum
prices. A number of methods which reduce the viscocity of the oil could in
principle be used. It was therefore decided to proceed in three stages:
first, a comparative evaluation of different EOR techniques to determine the
appropriate method to use; second, a field test of the method chosen to
evaluate its applicability; and third, if appropriate, the full-scale appli-
cation of the EOR method to the whole Bati Raman field. An engineering loan
(S-13 TU) for US$2.5 million for the first phase was approved by the Bank's
Executive Directors in November 1978.
5.03      Using the funds provided in the initial Bati Raman Enhanced Oil
Recovery Project, TPAO contracted a consultant group (Intercomp & Godsey-
Earlougher) to carry out an engineering study to determine the optimal
techniques for increasing the recovery from the field. The consultant
examined in detail three prospective methods: in situ combustion, steam
flooding and carbon dioxide injection. The results of the laboratory and
computer simulation studies indicate that carbon dioxide injection in the
oil reservoir is the recommended EOR method; this supports the results of
previous studies undertaken by TPAO. As is standard practice for EOR projects
a demonstration test must now be undertaken to determine whether the technology
will, in fact, produce the expected results before the full-scale application
of the technology is considered.
5.04      The enhanced recovery investment is expected to result in a sub-
stantial increase in oil recovery from the Bati Raman reservoir. TPAO con-
sultants estimate that full-scale application should result in 17% recovery of
the oil in place over a 20-year period, equivalent to 270 million barrels
(42 million tons of oil equivalent); this is more than twice Turkey's current



- 34 -
recoverable oil reserves. Peak production is forecast to reach 55,000 b/d.
The proposed pilot project will be applied to 10% of the field area with the
objective of testing efficiency of the CO injection technology rather than
initiating commercial production; production is forecast to increase from its
present level of 2000 b/d to 6000 b/d. Although two separate and independent
Bank-financed consultants consider that the estimates of overall recovery and
peak production rates forecast by TPAO consultants are optimistic, an ultimate
recovery factor of only 5% would still yield additional recoverable reserves
of 60 million barrels of oil, equal to approximately half the present remain-
ing reserves of Turkey.
5.05      During the final stage of the Bati Raman EOR study, the Government
of Turkey requested assistance not only to undertake a field demonstration
test for Bati Raman but also for the development of additional reserves in
the Raman oil field, and in the assessment of the production potential of the
Hamitabat gas field in Thrace, northwestern Turkey. In addition, it requested
that the Bank assume a larger role in assisting TPAO to expand its petroleum
exploration and development program. This latter assistance is covered in the
Turkey Petroleum Exploration Project report.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General Objectives
5.06      The proposed project has two main objectives:  (1) to increase
Turkey's crude oil production in the short term by developing the newly
discovered oil reserves; (2) to expand Turkey-s recoverable reserves base and
to enhance its medium-term petroleum production capacity. These objectives
would be achieved by helping finance the following four subprojects:
(i) The Bati Raman Field Test - a field demonstration test of the
chosen carbon dioxide EOR technology on a limited area of the
Bati Raman reservoir. It would evaluate the suitability of
this technology for full field use, and determine the data
required for designing the full field project. It would
require the drilling of wells at the Dodan Gas field to pro-
duce carbon dioxide gas, the removal of sulphur from the gas,
the construction of a 75 km pipeline system to transport a
55 million cubic feet per day of carbon dioxide gas from the
Dodan gas field to the Bati Raman oil field, the drilling of
an additional 5 wells in Bati Raman, the preparation of a total
30 wells to handle CO2 injection and oil production, and the
installation of associated equipment in Dodan and Bati Raman.
Workover rigs, a cementing truck, specialized laboratory equip-
ment and services comprising technical assistance for testing,
monitoring and evaluating the results would be required.
(ii)  The Raman Field Development - a production project covering
the cost of 18 new production wells and associated surface
equipment in the northern extension of the Raman field and a
reservoir analysis study which would determine the optimum
approach to a secondary recovery program for the field.



- 35 -
(iii)  The Thrace (Hamitabat) Gas Field - an evaluation of the
production potential of the Thrace field to provide reliable
estimates of gas reserves and productivity, and a study to
determine the optimum use of the gas.
(iv) Technical Assistance - to strengthen TPAO's operations
and management capabilities.
These four subcomponents are described more fully in the ensuing paragraphs.
1.   Bati Raman Field Test
5.07      The Bati Raman oil field is by far the largest oil accumulation in
Turkey. The field is a large limestone structure 17 km x 14 km with a payzone
thickness of sixty to seventy meters. The field is producing now at a rate
of about 2,000 barrels per day from ninety-two wells. (See Annex 5.04 for
detailed specifications on the field.) The absence of a significant water
drive and the low percentage of gas in solution combined with the high vis-
cosity of the crude oil have resulted in a low primary oil recovery rate
estimated at 1.5 to 2.0 percent of the oil in place. About one percent of
the oil in place has already been recovered. A small waterflood pilot project
conducted between 1971 and 1978 indicated that this secondary recovery tech-
nique could be expected to achieve, at best, only a moderately increased
recovery to five percent of the oil in place.
5.08      An enhanced recovery scheme of a more complex nature was clearly
essential if TPAO was to achieve a significant increase in recovery from
this field. Preliminary screening of known enhanced oil recovery methods
was carried out using all available laboratory and field data. Polymer and
chemical flooding methods were excluded due to unfavorable reservoir rock
and fluid characteristics. In situ combustion methods were eliminated
because results from field tests in comparable carbonate reservoirs in the
USA produced unacceptable results in the face of operating problems in con-
trolling the process and the risk of damage to the reservoir.
5.09      The two most promising EOR technologies were steam flooding, which
would consume a quarter of the produced oil to generate the required steam, and
carbon dioxide (CO ) injection, which could use CO  from the Dodan field some
75 km away.  Computer simulation studies indicated the economic and technical
attractiveness of the carbon dioxide EOR technology over steam flooding for
the Bati Raman field. The projected ultimate recovery factor from carbon
dioxide injection ranged from 17 to 30 percent depending on the assumed rock
and fluid characteristics, the well spacing, and the reservoir behavior.
However, since the basic data for a simulation model must come from the
production performance data of the field, which in this case was limited to
the field's 1.5 percent oil recovery, the reliability of the results of the
model is limited. Nevertheless, unlike the other technologies evaluated,
the CO method has the important advantage that even if it failed to increase
the oii recovery as expected, it would leave the reservoir unaltered. Thus,
the oil could still be recovered by another method at a later date. In
addition to TPAO csconsultants, two independent consultants with extensive



- 36 -
experience in heavy oil also evaluated the feasibility of the carbon dioxide
injection technique for the Bata Raman field. All agreed on the recommenda-
tion of proceeding with the CO2 injection pilot.  Where differences exist in
the consultants recommendations, they relate to the scale and phasing of the
recommended pilot and to the overall recovery of oil forecast. There are,
therefore, three independent assessments of the technical feasibility of
the proposed EOR method which, while differing on some points of detail,
are in agreement on the basic steps to be taken. The feasibility and method-
ology of carbon dioxide method are discussed in Annex 5.03 in greater detail.
5.10      A field demonstration test of the CO2 EOR technique in a limited
reservoir area is now required to evaluate the suitability of the recommended
technology for this reservoir. This is an essential procedure because, (i)
each oil reservoir is essentially unique in its behavior characteristics, (ii)
the characteristics of this reservoir in particular are still largely unknown
as its production history accounts for only a small percentage of the oil in
place, (iii) the carbon dioxide injection technique is untested for this type
of heavy oil or for this type of reservoir. The results of this demonstration
test will provide TPAO with the basic operating data required for it to design
an efficient field-wide development project. A combined carbon dioxide and
water injection test was proposed in the central part of the field. However,
due to the time needed for acquiring experience for CO EOR technology and
for assimilating the data generated from CO2 test, TPAO has agreed to post-
pone the beginning of this test until the Bank agrees that the results of the
tests described in its implementation program (para. 5.26) justify beginning
new tests in the central section.
(a) Drilling and Reworking of Bati Raman Wells
5.11      The western section of the Bati Raman field was chosen for the test
area because of its more favorable reservoir characteristics and its more
closely spaced wells (32 acres/well). The twenty-six existing wells in the
western section will have to be re-equipped to handle the acidity of CO2
saturated oil, and an additional five or six additional wells will also have
to be drilled to complete the spacing pattern and provide adequate locations
for data collection.
(b) Development of the Dodan Carbon Dioxide Gas Field
and Purification and Transportation of the Gas
5.12      The CO2 will come from three reservoirs in the Dodan field, located
about 75 km from Bati Raman. The total recoverable gas reserve of Dodan is
estimated by TPAO at about 300 billion cubic feet, sufficient for the full-
scale application of the CO2 EOR program in the Bati Raman field.  The reserve
estimate has been verified independently by the project design consultants.
Five or six additional wells may have to be drilled to provide the CO2
requirement of the project, and all the wells will have to be completed for



- 37 -
production. 1/ A sulfur removal unit will be required since the Dodan gas
contains high levels of hydrogen sulfide which must be removed before it is
transported. Compressors of approximately 55 MMcf/d capacity will be installed
at Dodan to raise the gas pressure to 2000 psi to transport it 75 km by pipe-
line to Bati Raman. The pipeline will be ten inches in diameter and will be
coated and buried.
5.13      Electric power necessary for the operation of Bati Raman field is
supplied through the national grid. TPAO has negotiated an agreement and
timetable with TEK for the connection of the Dodan facilities to the national
grid (about 35 km) in line with the project requirements. The costs will be
paid by TEK and recovered through power usage charges. Emergency power
generators will be supplied by TPAO and are included in the project.
(c) Surface Facilities, Equipment and Monitoring Services
5.14      At Bati Raman, the EOR demonstration test will require continuous
servicing of the wells, including pulling out the pumps, changing the tubing,
selectively sealing certain horizons for injection and running specific well
monitoring devices. TPAO owns and operates nine workover rigs and five
pulling units. This number however is not sufficient to cover the needs of
the present operations. Two new workover rigs, a cement truck, monitoring
devices and services, and specialized laboratory equipment will be required
for the proper implementation and follow-up of the EOR test and have been
included in the project. The mixture of oil, gas, water and CO proluced
will be processed in a gathering and separating station, and a small water
disposal system that will be installed in the project area. The carbon
dioxide gas separated from the produced crude will be vented to the atmosphere
during the demonstration test in a way designed to ensure the maintenance of
good air quality (see para 5.53). If a field-wide application of carbon
dioxide EOR technology is later adopted, the produced carbon dioxide will be
separated and reinjected into the reservoir.
5.15      Expected Results from the Field Test.  It is anticipated that the
demonstration test will yield a cumulative additional production of four
million barrels of oil from the tested western area over a period of 1,000
days. The TPAO consultant considers this recovery quite conservative, since
it represents less than four percent of the oil in place in the tested area as
compared to an anticipated ultimate recovery of 17 to 30 percent (para 4.12).
In addition to the higher rates of production, valuable information will be
obtained throughout the next two years. Data obtained on the oil recovery,
1/   Completion covers all operations after the wells are drilled and
cemented. It includes perforating the cemented casing at the production
horizon, installing the tubing (production pipes), and installing the
surface and subsurface valves, safety equipment, and where necessary,
pumps.

produced gas oil ratios, length and frequency of the CO injection cycle,
well shutdown time, and corrosive effects of CO2 would ie used to modify the
original computer EOR model and provide a sound practical basis for designing
field wide application of an EOR technology suitable for Bati Raman. A full
scale application of such a technology could call for funds in excess of
US$300 million (mid-1980 US$) between 1985 and 1990.
2.   Raman Field Development
5.16      The Raman field was discovered in 1940. 1/  Commercial production
started in 1948, with cumulative production through 1979 amounting to 31,764,000
barrels (4.7 million tons). A total of 129 wells have been drilled in the
Raman field since its discovery. Drilling of stepout wells in 1977 and 1978
indicated a sizeable extension of the oil reservoir north of the then known
limits of the field. Thirty-two wells were completed in this extension in
1979 with an average oil production of 150 barrels per day (8,000 tons per
year). TPAO is proceeding with a development program which calls for an
additional thirty-five wells during 1980 and 1981, but is hampered by a
shortage of drilling and production supplies and services. TPAO expects to
be able to complete half of the program with its currently available supplies
before the proposed project becomes effective.
5.17      The proposed project covers the cost of drilling and completing
eighteen wells out of the thirty-five well program and the cost of the surface
and subsurface pumping equipment and crude oil handling, testing and dehydra-
tion equipment. It also covers the necessary equipment, materials and spares
for the drilling rigs, the heavy vehicles that TPAO requires for the efficient
drilling and completion operations of the Raman, Bati Raman and Dodan wells,
as well as the financing of the specialized well logging services required.
5.18      The Raman field is also producing 6,300 barrels per day of oil-
contaminated salt water which currently is dumped into ravines and finds
its way into nearby rivers. Since the field is underlain by an active
watertable, an increasing quantity of water is produced along with the oil as
the field is depleted. Between 1978 and 1979 this tendency accelerated, and
the water cut increased from 25 to 40 percent of the fluid produced. For
this reason, the project includes a component for the design and installation
of a water disposal system. The development of a detailed design for this
environmental control system acceptable to the Bank would be a condition of
disbursement for this project component.
5.19      While the ultimate recovery from the Raman field is currently
projected at not more than 20 percent of the oil in place, the application
of a carefully designed secondary recovery project could double the recovery
factor to 40 percent. This represents the recovery of an additional 72
million barrels (10 million tons). The project will provide the technical
1/   Basic data on the field can be found in Annex 5.02, Part B.



- 39 -
services needed for data gathering and reservoir analysis which will be used
to design the secondary recovery program.
3.   Thrace (Hamitabat) Gas Field
5.20      The purpose of this subproject is to evaluate the production
potential of the Hamitabat gas field and to determine the optimum utilization
of the gas. Although seven wells have been drilled and three are currently
producing a total of five million cubic feet per day of gas, neither the reserve
estimates nor the production forecasts are sufficiently reliable to allow for
the implementation of projects designed to consume the gas over an extended
period of time. TPAO's gas reserve estimates are still unconfirmed primarily
because the field has not yet been completely delineated and properly mapped
and because existing wells were not cored or fully logged. In order to
determine the maximum daily production that can be obtained from each well,
the wells must be stimulated by fracturing 1/. Stimulation has been tried
on one well, and, although the process was not completed due to equipment
failures, the results were encouraging as production from the well more than
doubled. Thus, the information that is currently available is sufficient to
lead the Bank to believe that at least enough gas could be produced to justify
the construction of a gas-fired thermal electric plant that would help reduce
Turkey's electric energy shortfall without requiring the importation of
additional fuel oil.
5.21      The project is designed to provide reliable estimates of gas
reserves and productivity. TPAO has programmed the drilling of three addi-
tional wells to better delineate the field. Core and log data from these
wells, along with reinterpretation of existing seismic data and the running
of an additional seismic line through the field, should allow TPAO to remap
the field with considerably greater accuracy. Six to ten wells will be
fractured and tested to determine the wells' ultimate gas deliverability. As
a second phase of the project, technical assistance for a study of the optimum
utilization of the gas will be provided.
4.   Technical Assistance to Improve TPAO's Management and Organization
5.22      In addition to the specific studies included as part of the above
project components, it is proposed to provide TPAO with assistance for
improving its operational productivity and its management organization (see
para 3.21). The organizational structure, systems of internal communication,
control of operations, warehousing, accounting and financial management
systems and financial planning should be carefully reviewed with an aim to
improving TPAO's performance within set policy objectives. It is proposed
that a management and financial consultant firm well versed in the petroleum
1/   Stimulation of oil or gas wells is usually accomplished by pumping acid
in the formation or by fracturing the formation under very high pressure,
then pumping a propping agent to keep the fractures open. In either
case more and wider channels are opened for the fluid to flow from the
reservoir to the well bore, resulting in increased well productivity.

industry and acceptable to the Bank would carry out this study in cooperation
with TPAO's management. The terms of reference for the study have been agreed
upon, and TPAO has agreed to initiate the study by April 1, 1981, for comple-
tion by June 1, 1982. TPAO's management would review the results of the
study and, within three months after the completion date of the study, would
consult with the Bank on the consultant's proposals and TPAO-s plans for
implementation of these proposals.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
5.23      TPAO will have overall responsibility for the implementation of
the project since it has the necessary material, infrastructure and the basic
human resources to handle the work load. TPAO's drilling and workover rigs
and other supporting facilities will be used in the Bati Raman enhanced oil
recovery field demonstration test, in the Raman and Dodan field developments
and in exploration work. In areas where TPAO's technical capabilities are
lacking, foreign expertise will be called upon. The supervision and monitor-
ing services for the carbon dioxide EOR demonstration project would be pro-
vided by a consulting firm experienced in EOR projects. TPAO has started
training some technicians under the first EOR Bank loan. These technicians
and others whose training is provided for under this loan will work as
counterparts to the consultants. Well logging operations for the Raman,
Dodan, Hamitabat fields and for exploration wells, which will be funded by
the Bank, will be provided by a competent foreign contractor. The Hamitabat
stimulation work will be carried out by one of a limited number of interna-
tional service contractors who specialize in this work.
5.24      Consultant firms acceptable to the Bank will be engaged by TPAO
to (i) design all the components of the EOR project and (ii) supervise the
project implementation and start-up. BOTAS (Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima
Anonim Sirketi), the subsidiary of TPAO responsible for the 980 km Iraq-
Turkey crude oil pipeline will assist in designing the gas pipeline.
5.25      To ensure the proper implementation of the project, TPAO will create
special project implementation groups for each project component. The organi-
zation and staffing of the groups, their technical responsibilities, their
financial authority, and their lines of communication with Headquarters
and district managers have been agreed upon with the Bank. The effectiveness
of the groups and the adequacy of their staffing will be reviewed during
project implementation, with the understanding that if their effective-
ness falls below levels acceptable to the Bank (particularly as a result
of the departure of experienced technical personnel), TPAO would accept
additional outside technical assistance to ensure proper implementation of
the project.
5.26      Project implementation will be undertaken in phases.  TPAO will
start by injecting CO2 initially into a few selected wells; the injection
and production wells will be fully instrumented so that their behavior can
be closely monitored. The number of wells will be successively increased



- 41 -
as experience in handling CO2 is gained and more information on the reser-
voir's response is assimilated. TPAO has agreed to present for the Bank's
approval, before April 30, 1981, a phased project implementation program.
During the actual implementation of the field demonstration test, progress
will be reviewed at regular 4-month intervals; furthermore, the Bank's con-
currence will be required before a decision is taken to extend the initial
testing phase to the full 30-well program of the field test.
5.27      TPAO will also establish a Project Advisory Panel of three to five
technical personnel from companies and institutions in Canada, the USA,
France, and possibly Venezuela, currently involved in EOR projects using
either heavy oil or carbon-dioxide technologies. The panel would periodically
review the results generated by the field trials and the recommendations of
the project consultants and make recommendations about alternative approaches
to improving the efficiency of the tests. It will serve without financial
compensation, but will have full access to all project-related information.
TPAO has agreed to present to the Bank an acceptable proposal for the staff-
ing and the procedural policies of the advisory panel by October 1, 1981.
5.28      The implementation schedule of each of the individual subprojects
is summarized as follows:
Completion Date

(a)   Installation of facilities
to start CO2 EOR process                  June 1982

3.   Hamitabat Gas Field stimulation and
evaluation                                      March 1982
4.   Technical Assistance, TPAO productivity
and organization                                 June 1982
Project Costs
5.29      The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$102.0 mil-
lion equivalent; the foreign exchange component is estimated at US$62.0 million
(61 percent of project cost) not including interest during construction and
the local currency component is estimated at US$40 million equivalent, all
based on mid-1980 prices.



- 42 -
duties. Overall physical and price contingencies used in the total cost
estimate amount to US$27.5 million equivalent, (38 percent of the project base
cost). Physical contingencies were estimated at 25 percent of the cost on
items which have not been fully detailed (main gas line, gas compressor, power
generator, sulphur removal unit and other surface facilities) and at 15
percent of all the other items, with a weighted average of about 20 percent.
Price contingencies were estimated in dollar terms at 10.5, 9, 8, and 8
percent for the yea't 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.  The project cost estimate
was based on the January 1980 estimate prepared by the consultants who under-
took the EOR feasibility study, on the estimates of the geologist consultant
who assisted in defining the exploration component and on TPAO's own statistics
and records.
5.30      For estimating the cost of consultant services for special studies
and technical assistance a man-month rate of $10,000 plus local subsistence
and travel was assumed for long duration assignments, while a $12,000 rate
plus local subsistence and travel was assumed for assignments shorter than
three months resulting in a gross overall cost of $14,000 and $16,000 per man
month, respectively. These rates are deemed to be both reasonable and in line
with current charges prevailing in the petroleum industry for the expertise
and experience level required for the project. Approximately 120 man months
of consultant services would be required for implementing the Raman, Bati
Raman and Thrace components. An additional 60 manmonths would be required for
the financial, organization and productivity studies. Cost of laboratory
analysis, specialized equipment and services, and computer time was added to
the straight man-month costs whenever such services were required.
5.31      Estimated cost of the project is summarized below.  Annex 5.06 gives
a more detailed breakdown of the various components costs.

(See para 5.02 for details.)
Financing Plan
5.32      The total estimated cost of the project, US$98.9 million equivalent
including physical and price contingencies, is expected to be funded from the
following sources:

5.33      It is proposed that the Bank loan be made to GOT on the standard
country terms. GOT will on-lend US$62.0 million equivalent to TPAO at an
interest applicable to commercially oriented enterprises, for seventeen years
including a four-year grace period, with TPAO bearing the exchange risk. The
previous engineering loan (Bank Loan No. S-13-TU) which amounts to US$2.5
million equivalent will be refinanced out of this loan.
Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.34      The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million would finance the following
items:
(i) 100 percent of foreign expenditure for the workover rigs, cement
truck, monitoring equipment, imported drilling materials, tubular
goods, spares, miscellaneous equipment, logging services and
stimulation work related to the following project components:
-    drilling and workover of Bati Raman wells;
-    drilling and completion of Dodan wells;
-    drilling and completion of Raman wells;
-    stimulation and testing of Hamitabat gas wells;
(ii) 100 percent of the foreign expenditure for the Dodan gas sulphur
removal unit, gas compressors, generators and line pipes for
the gas flowlines and transmission lines to Bati Raman;
(iii) 50 percent of the construction cost of the gas transmission
line to Bati Raman;
(iv) 100 percent of the cost of oil well pumping units whether
imported or locally assembled;
(v) 100 percent of the foreign expenditure for the consultancy ser-
vices covering design, supervision of implementation, monitoring
of operations, studies, technical assistance and training.
1/   The IBRD loan includes $2.5 million for refinancing of the engineering
loan No. S-13-TU.

5.35      Disbursement of the Bank loan is expected as follows:
Calendar Year      1981     1982      1983
(US$ million)
Incremental        35.0     23.0       4.0
Cumulative         35.0     58.0      62.0
Procurement
5.36      Goods and services financed under the proposed Bank loan would
be procured in accordance with the Bank guidelines except that equipment,
material or services estimated to cost less than US$0.1 million and not
exceeding the aggregate of US$2.0 million may be procured in accordance with
TPAO's procedures for limited international tender which are acceptable to the
Bank. Limited international tender will be used for the specialized services
of well logging (US$750,000) and well stimulation (US$1,180,000). In each case
quotations will be requested from the three qualified international contrac-
tors known to be able to provide these services. Consultant services for
monitoring (US$1,300,000) of the EOR project will be contracted for by TPAO
in accordance with Bank guidelines. Qualified local suppliers participating
in international competitive bidding would be accorded a preference of 15
percent or the prevailing duty, whichever is lower. Bid invitation and
evaluation within the appropriate Bank guidelines would be the responsibility
of TPAO.
5.37      The contracting for certain services, equipment and materials before
the Board approval might be critical to the project schedule. In view of the
long delivery time (estimated between nine and twelve months) of the carbon
dioxide compressor, the workover rigs and certain drilling maLerials and
spares, actions for prequalifcation of suppliers and invitations for bids are
in progress. Retroactive financing to the extent of US$1.5 million would
cover the cost of detailed design engineering services for the project estimated
at $500,000 and down payment on the above equipment if contracts were awarded
before Board Presentation, the expense of logging some Raman and Hamitabat
wells and the balance of the cost of detailed engineering design of the Bati
Raman project.
Project Risks
5.36      The application of carbon dioxide enhanced recovery methods to
heavy oil reservoirs is an untested technique. While laboratory and computer
simulation work suggest recovery factors in excess of 17 percent for the Bati
Raman field, there is no field operational data to support these studies.
The data available on reservoir characteristics is insufficient to eliminate
the possibility that the CO gas could bypass most of the oil through large
fractures and exit from welis in other sections of the field, thereby greatly
reducing the efficiency of the process. In addition, problems inherent to
Bati Raman field operations, such as extremely low pumping efficiencies, high



- 46 -
back pressure on wells and difficulties in working over the wells could also
further reduce the estimated production. However, even if the carbon dioxide
technology failed to increase the oil recovery as expected, it would leave the
reservoir unaltered so that the oil might still be recovered by other tech-
niques. Technical assistance provided for the supervision of the project
execution and the monitoring of the operation will provide timely and expert
advice which will minimize the production losses and maximize the recovery.
Knowledge gained from the demonstration project will be utilized in field-wide
applications to Bati Raman and other heavy oil reservoirs in Turkey.
5.37      The risks associated with other components of the project are those
normally inherent in the petroleum industry. There is a minimal risk with
the development infill drilling of the Raman field. The project risks will
be further reduced through the use of seismic surveys and geological studies
funded by another Bank loan. While the stimulation of the Hamitabat gas wells
is expected to boost their production rates, it is not certain how great
the increase will be. However, an early stimulation of one Hamitabat well,
though incomplete, gave encouraging results.
Training
5.38      Training of Turkish technicians in enhanced oil recovery techno-
logy and related engineering disciplines has already been initiated under
the previous Bank engineering loan. Local technicians will assist in the
project design and will actively participate in monitoring the EOR demonstra-
tion test.
Environmental Consideration
5.39      The Raman field is producing at present about 6,300 barrels of salt
water per day. This water, which is normally contaminated with oil, is dumped
into the ravines and eventually flows into nearby rivers. Water production
from the Raman field will increase as the field ages. The project includes
a water treatment and disposal system in the Raman field (see para 5.18).
A similar but smaller system is also provided for Bati Raman.
VI. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
6.01      The project components (described in chapter five) together form
an integrated petroleum development package for Turkey: an early increase
in production from known oil fields, a continued growth of production from
producing oil fields over the medium term, and an improvement in the potential
for increasing the volume of known reserves and production from new oil fields
over the longer term.
6.02      The Raman Oil Field Project will generate an immediate increase in
crude oil production from new wells and will provide the information neces-
sary to maintain a high level of production from this oil field, which cur-
rently accounts for 40 percent of TPAO's total output. It will provide a



- 47 -
disposal system which will effectively eliminate the environmental pollution
caused by the drainage of oil-contaminated salt water into the headwaters of
the Tigris. Only the increase in production from the new wells is taken
into account in the economic rate of return calculation. With the increased
production valued at the equivalent import price and with the conservative but
reasonable assumption of an average initial production of 100 barrels per day
per IPew well and a rate of decline of 15 percent per year, the incremental oil
recovered in the first year of operation will be about 490,000 barrels, and
the total oil recovered over the project's life of twenty years will be 3.9
million barrels. As should be expected from an oil field development project
which does not include the exploration costs for discovering the field, the
rate of return is high, 61 percent. The economic cost and benefit streams are
summarized in Annex 6.01.
6.03      The Bati Raman Field Demonstration Test will also increase production
in the short term by about four million barrels (600,000 tons) in three years
of operation if it is completed successfully. However, this production is of
only secondary importance in terms of the value of the project to Turkey. The
important output of this engineering study will be the technical information
generated, because it will determine whether, and with what modifications,
TPAO can proceed with the full-scale field development of the CO2 injection
technology, or whether TPAO must abandon this technology and consider other
ways to fully exploit the Bati Raman field. The importance of this information
is demonstrated by the following figures. If the estimates of TPAO's consul-
tant of an incremental recovery of 17 percent of oil in place in the reservoir
as a result of applying the CO EOR technique to the whole of the Bati Raman
field and of a capital cost ot US$320 million for the field-wide application
are correct, the net present value of the field-wide program would be of the
order of $1.6 billion (using a ten percent discount rate) and the internal
rate of return would be over 70 percent. Furthermore, it would require an
incremental oil production of only three percent of the oil in place to allow
the project to earn a ten percent real rate of return. The chances of recover-
ing this much oil are regarded as being high. However, should the field test
results be so poor as to lead to abandonment of the CO2 EOR method, it would
still be possible to test the steam injection recovery method since the CO2
injection would not harm the oil reservor.  The CO2 gas pipeline and asso-
ciated equip-ment might also be used for carbon dioxide injection in other oil
fields operated by TPAO in the Batman area. Details.of the economic analysis
are in Annexes 6.02 and 6.03.
6.04      The Thrace Gas Field Engineering Project will provide the technical
basis for developing this field and using the gas as a substitute for imported
oil. The output of the project will be the results of the tests to determine
the potential production rates for gas wells in the field, the delineation
of the field, a more accurate estimate of the field's recoverable reserves,
and an evaluation of the alternative uses for the gas. If the study confirms
TPAO's estimates of 400 billion cu.ft. of recoverable reserves, the present
value of the field's output (discounted at 15 percent) would be over $400
million even if the gas was priced at $3 per MCF, about 65 percent of the
energy-equivalent price of imported fuel oil. While the reserve estimates



- 48 -
provided by TPAO may prove to be on the high side, even a conservative estimate
of one fourth the amount of recoverable reserves would be adequate to justify
the investment.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations the following issues were raised with TPAO
and assurances were obtained that:
(a) TPAO would, by April 1, 1981, establish as of January 1, 1981,
and thereafter maintain separate accounts and financial
statements with respect to all activities related to domes-
tic petroleum including exploration, production, refining
and distribution on the one hand, and all activities related
to imported oil on the other, with a view to completing
the full legal separation of these activities by
December 31, 1981 (para. 4.17).
(b) TPAO would, by January 1, 1981, transfer all responsibility
with respect to importing and marketing of imported petro-
leum and imported petroleum products to IPRAS (para. 3.24).
(c) TPAO would, by July 1, 1981, transfer operational control of
all of its facilities for refining imported oil (including
those related to the Mid-Anatolian Refinery) and related
properties to IPRAS (para. 3.25).
(d) TPAO would, by December 31, 1981, make all other necessary
arrangements to completely separate these activities
(para. 3.25).
(e) TPAO would furnish annually, by October 31 of each year
until completion of the Project, its proposed investment
program and its financial arrangements for the following
year (para. 4.18).
(f) TPAO would not incur any long-term debt in any year unless
a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures shows
that its aggregated projected net revenues for each full
fiscal year is at least two times the aggregated projected
debt service requirements (para. 4.18).
(g) TPAO would ensure that, by July 1, 1981, and at all times
thereafter, its aggregate current liabilities do not exceed
its aggregate current assets (para. 4.18).
(h) TPAO would, beginning in January 1, 1981, refrain from using
its internally-generated funds for its subsidiaries and other
companies in which it has an interest unless its own require-
ments have been met (para. 4.18).



- 49 -
(i) TPAO would revalue its assets annually for a memorandum
account, beginning with its fiscal year 1981, in accordance
with principles satisfactory to the Bank, and prepare and
furnish to the Bank non-statutory accounts and financial
statements for each fiscal year on such basis (para. 4.09).
(j) TPAO would conduct its operations so that at the beginning
of each month after July 1, 1981, it would have liquid
working capital including cash, marketable securities and
guaranteed lines of credit from commercial banks of at
least two months' estimated operating expenses (para 4.12).
(k) TPAO would provide the Bank with a copy of its audited
accounts within six months of the fiscal year (para. 3.28)
(1) TPAO would establish and maintain, until completion of the
project, a project implementation unit for each part of the
project with qualified and experienced staff, (if necessary
on a consultancy basis) satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.25).
(m)  TPAO would, with the assistance of consultants as necessary,
initiate, by April 1, 1981, financial and management studies
with a view to establishing policy objectives and improving
TPAO's overall performance, complete and furnish such studv
to the Bank by July 1, 1982, exchange views on such recommen-
dations with the Bank, and promptly thereafter take steps to
implement such recommendations (para. 5.22).
(n)  TPAO would prepare and furnish to the Bank, by December 31,
1981, recommendations designed to enable it to attract and
retain qualified technical personnel and to improve the
operational efficiency of its staff, and thereafter take
appropriate steps within its power to implement these
recommendations (para. 3.21).
(o) TPAO would provide the Bank with acceptable program for the
staffing and operational procedures of the Project Advisory
Panel by October 1, 1981 (para. 5.27).
(p) TPAO would, no later than October 1, 1981, furnish the Bank
with a phased implementation program acceptable to the Bank
for the Bati Raman project component, and would begin each
subsequent phase only after the earlier phase has been satis-
factorily completed (para. 5.26).
(q) TPAO would not begin test for enhanced oil recovery in the
central section of the Bati Raman field unless it has carried
out the field tests described in its implementation program
and the Bank agrees that the results thereof justify beginning
such tests in the central section (para. 5.10).



- 50 -
(R)  TPAO would make arrangements acceptable to the Bank to
secure the supply of electricity for the Dodan carbon
dioxide gas fieid (para. 5.13).
7.02      Assurances were also obtained from the Government of Turkey that:
(a) As of January 1, 1981, the responsibility for exchange losses
from debts related to the import of petroleum and petroleum
products would be transferred from TPAO to IPRAS (para. 4.06).
(b) Should the accounts receivable of TPAO at any time exceed
its sales for the previous two months, the GOT would provide
or cause to be provided to TPAO, to ensure TPAO's liquidity,
the amount by which such receivables exceed such sales at an
interest rate not greater than the average rate TPAO receives
on its outstanding receivables (para. 4.12).
(c) Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that the funds
available to TPAO will be inadequate to meet the estimated
local expenditures required for the carrying out of the
project, the GOT would make arrangements satisfactory to the
Bank to promptly provide TPAO or cause TPAO to be provided
with such funds as are needed to meet such expenditures as
an equity contribution to TPAO (para. 4.17)
(d) TPAO would attain, by July 1, 1981, a ratio of its long-term
debt to its equity not greater than 50:50 (para. 4.17).
7.03      As a condition of disbursement for the Raman field development
subproject, TPAO must provide to the Bank an acceptable conceptual detailed
design of the water disposai system for the Raman field (para. 5.18).
7.04       Based on the above assurances, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of $62 million for 17 years including 4 years of grace.

ANNEX 2.02
Page 1 of 2
THE OPERATION OF THE STABILIZATION
AND DECREE 20 FUNDS
The Stabilization Fund
The Stabilization Fund is concerned only with imported products
refined from imported crude oil. It makes up the difference between the
wholesale price that distributes pay for petroleum products and the ex-refinery
prices that refiners charge or that importers of products charge. It receives
funds when the wholesale prices are higher than the ex-refinery prices and it
pays out funds when the ex-refinery prices rise to levels above the wholesale
prices.
The fund is necessary since the ex-refinery prices and wholesale
prices are set by totally independent mechanisms. It was originally created
to allow the government to maintain fixed consumer prices and at the same
time compensate refineries for small changes in ex-refinery sales prices.
This was necessary because the ex-refinery prices were set on the basis of
the hypothetical cost of importing products from the lowest cost foreign
refinery, whereas wholesale prices were set by the government at fixed
levels which were decided on the basis of political considerations, and were
seldom changed. In the period before the OPEC action of 1973 small fluctuation
in the price of imported products and crude in one direction where usually
compensated by small fluctuation in the other direction, so the fund could
maintain a reasonable equilibrium.   However, in the period since 1974, the
Stabilization Fund has been used to keep refining margins low, to cross subside
petroleum product consumption, and to maintain product prices at low levels.
The Fund was used to set refinery margins at low levels by the simple practice
of discounting the hypothetical cost ex-refinery product prices by a certain
percentage. This percentage, which was determined originally in 1975 by a
joint Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance committee in 1975 is different
for each refinery. Presumably, the different rates (8% for Izmir and 12% for
IPRAS) are based on the relative efficiencies of the refineries.
The Fund is used to cross subsidize products because the large
difference between the wholesale price actually paid by the distributers and
the theoretically based "real" sales price received by refinery. The Fund
is used to maintain prices at a low level whenever the cross stabilization
program creates insufficient revenue from the higher prices products to pay
for the subsidized products. This is particularly apt to happen in situations
like those that occured in 1979 when TPAO had to import products directly.
In this case, the Fund pays the difference between the actual import cost
(plus a 5% importer's margin) and the fixed wholesale price. When this happens,
it can have serious repercussions for TPAO. Because the Stabilization Fund has
no external source of financing, it is not able to pay out when it goes into
deficit. As a result, whenever it is in deficit, the debit shows up on
TPAO's books as an accounts receivable item. In 1979 this accounted for
TL 8 billion of TPAO's receivables.

The Decree 20 Fund
The Decree 20 Fund is concerned exclusively with domestically
produced crude and the products from this crude. It was originally created
to absorb the windfall profits that came with the OPEC price increases of
1973. To do this it provides a system whereby it receives payments in
relation to the difference between the base period (December 31, 1973)
prices and the current market prices at the production, refining and
distribution stages.
At the production stage the Fund receives a payment equal to the
difference between theoretical price of imported crude and the $5.21 which
was in effect at the base date. For old oil (that producted from wells
in operation before January 1, 1979) the producer is allowed to keep only
$5.21, the base period price of crude, plus any assignable increases in the
cost of producing this oil since the based period. The difference between
this price and the theoretical price of imported crude is paid to the Fund.
The refinery is also allowed to keep the same margin (in dollar terms) that
it was making at the based period. Since the refinery purchases the crude
at its theoretical "real" price, and sells the products at their theoretical
"real" price, any increase in this spread must be paid to the Fund. As the
distribution stage the Decree 20 Fund works the same way as the Stabilization
Fund in that it compensates for the difference between the theoretical "real"
sales price of a product and the actual purchase price that the distributer
pays. Because the first two stages are always positive, the Decree 20 Fund
has always had a surplus. The 1980 surplus is projected at more than $400
million, and it will decrease as the volume of petroleum subject to the
assessment deminished, it will remain an important source of funds throughout
the decade.

owns three subsidiaries, PETLAS Rubber Industrial and
Commercial Corp., Cyprus-Turkish Industrial Administration
Holding Corp., and PETETER Chemical Industry and Commercial
Corp.
(3) IPRAGAZ (1966, 49 percent interest) bottles and markets LPG
gas for household consumption (196,000 tons of LPG in 1978).
It also has an interest in two subsidiaries which market gas
household appliances and manufacture gas bottles.
(4) TUMAS (1969, 19 percent interest) offers engineering,
consulting, and contracting services domestically.
(5) IGSAS (1970, 100 percent interest) manufactures urea fer-
tilizer (512,000 tons annual capacity) at a plant near the
IPRAS refinery.
(6) DITAS (1974, 45 percent interest) is responsible for marine
transport of crude and products (6 million tons per year)

Income Statements
Non-Operating Income and Expense: After 1980 (foreign exchange loss of
TL 8.1 billion attributable to year end 1979 accounts payable) it is assumed
that dividends from subsidiaries and other non-operating income would cover
interest expense, and that after exchange losses on made good by GOT.
Provision for Tax: At 28% of net income after off-setting 30% of
capital expenditures financed from own funds.
Balance Sheets
Net Current Assets: Since it is not possible to forecast the absolute
values of accounts receivable and payable under the prevailing circumstances
in Turkey, it has been assumed that these will be held equal, whatever their
value, and the net current value is therefore represented by cash balance only.
Fixed Assets: Capital expenditure has been added to gross fixed asset
values for the year of expenditure and construction in progress has been held
at a nominal TL 4 billion.
Provision for Depreciation: At 14% of gross fixed assets as in the
last two years.

Investment: Foreign exchange shortages will constrain the growth of crude
oil imports.- This will allow TPAO to postpone construction of the Mid-Anatolia
refinery and associated pipeline until after 1985.

Overall. future Financial Requirements
TPAO's proposed capital investment program for the years 1980-83
involves expenditures totaling TL 135 billion (US$2.8 billion) at yearend 1979
prices, as detailed in Annex 2.01. The investment program appears large in
comparison to TPAO's asset base partly because, as noted above, assets in
TPAO's books are recorded at historical TL cost which seriously understates
their value. The program is unrealistically ambitious in the time frame
proposed in that it proposes a doubling of national refinery capacity and a
more than doubling of exploration activity, as discussed in para. 2.14. If,
as expected, the mid-Anatolia refinery, its associated pipeline and the Izmir
refinery expansion are deferred, the investment program will be reduced to TL
75 billion (US$1.6 billion). The eventual cost of these programs in current
prices will, of course, be determined by the actual inflation rates that occur
in Turkey over the period. Furthermore, since the local cost of the invest-
ments are expected to come from the Decree 20 Fund, which would normally bear
an interest rate of 12-1/2 percent (as they have in the past), the inflation
rate will also have an impact on the cash flow net of debt service that TPAO
will be able to generate to finance its investment program. In order to
estimate the possible range of TPAO's self-financing capabilities a sensitivity
analysis was carried out for the limiting cases of the full and the reduced
investment program and for a high inflation rate (starting at 90 percent in
1980 and gradually reducing to 20 percent by 1984) and a low inflation rate
(starting at 30 percent and reducing to 20 percent in 1983) with parallel
devaluation assumptions (see Annex 4.04 for details). The results summarized
below indicate that even in the unlikely event of the implementation of the
full investment program and a low level of inflation, the self-financing ratio
would still be 45 percent.

*For its external finance requirements, TPAO will continue to have
access to the Decree 20 Fund, as well as to the State Investment Bank if
necessary. In fact, for the next five years under any of the above scenarios
and on the basis of the current Fund levy and the projection of the quantity
of oil that will be produced from existing fields, it is estimated that the
Decree 20 Fund should have more than sufficient resources (assuming foreign
exchange is made available) to finance that part of TPAO's investment program
that is not financed from internal resources.

Future Financial Performance
The alternative assumptions on inflation and exchange ratas (para.
4.08) clearly affect the monetary value of TPAO's sales, costs and income.
But analysis shows that gross margins would vary only slightly, averaging 15
percent to sales over the period. The financial projections for the period
1980-84 which appear at Annexes 4 .01-4.03 describe a moderate inflation case
(60 percent, falling to 20 percent by 1983); and assume (i) the retention of
the basic pricing formulae described in paras. 2.21-2.23 (ii) the adoption of
the financial policies described in the foregoing paragraphs, and (iii)
construction of the reduced capital program. On this basis the forecasts
would be:

BATI RAMAN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY PROJECT
Notes on the Feasibility and the Operation of C02 EOR Injec-
tion in Bati Raman (Excerpts from the Consultant's Report
1.        A promising way to improve the recovery in the Bati Raman Field is by
the injection of Dodan gas. The oil recovery mechanism using Dodan gas is based
upon the ability of Dodan gas to dissolve in oil, swell the oil, and reduce its
viscosity. After a large volume of oil has been saturated, operating alternatives
include (a) continuing with cyclic Dodan gas stimulation or (b) water-flooding the
saturated oil.
2.        The major task is saturating substantial quantities of oil by cyclic
injection of Dodan gas. The process begins by repressuring portions of the reser-
voir with Dodan gas, allowing it to diffuse into the oil it contacts. Some oil
will be by-passed either because the reservoir is a dual-porosity system and the
flow is predominately in the fracture system, or because it is a single-porosity
system when the unfavorable mobility ratio causes the Dodan gas to finger. In
either case, diffusion is important. This section begins by discussing how the
laboratory work was used to determine how best to account for diffusion.
3.        In the cyclic application of Dodan gas after the reservoir pressure is
built up through the injection of gas, the wells are produced back, producing the
saturated oil and some of the injected gas. Because this is a depletion gas drive,
depletion data need to be matched so that this stage of the process can also be
modelled. The cyclic process is repeated until a large volume of oil becomes
saturated, at which point water-flooding the region is considered. Because it is
likely that the reservoir rock is made up of some combination of a single- and
a dual-porosity system, the behavior of this recovery scheme in both a dual-
porosity system and a single-porosity system has been considered.

4.        Injected C02 during the initial cycle might spread out laterally over
a vertical profile in a few erratic streaks, with variable penetration of 10 to
20 times (high over low). If so, the second cycle will amplify the initial pro-
file and so on in subsequent cycles.
5.        If this happens, the C02 requirements per barrel of oil production would
accelerate out of proportion to that expected if more oil in the vertical pro-
file could be contacted.   Even so, the capability of C02 to dissolve in oil and
mobilize it with pressure drawdown would be demonstrated and quantified, though
in a limited reservoir volume.
6.        If this happens, the need for selective injection and the possible use
of alternating slugs of water might prove necessary even in the cyclic stimulation
approach.
7.        Economically, the accelerating waste of C02 necessarily vented during
each cycle might justify well workovers and other changes in plans before a full 2-
year program is completed.
8.        Most likely, each well will perform differently.  The performance of the
demonstration project will characterize the heterogeneity of the reservoir rock
systems and establish a sound basis for designing programs to maximize oil recovery
efficiency.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
OF THE BATI RAMAN FIELD TEST
The objective of the economic comparison of alternative EOR methods is
to assess whether one is clearly superior to the others, so that only one process
needs to be tested in the field.  The comparative economic analysis has shown CO2
(Dodan gas) cyclic injection to be the most promising process and worthy of an
engineering field demonstration.
Computer simulations are ultimately as accurate as their assumed para-
meters. The following economic and engineering assumptions were used in the base
case simulation of the Dodan gas injection system (with sensitivity analysis
alternatives as noted):
ECONOMIC PARAMETERS
1.   Oil Price--Because the present international oil market is fluid, a
calculation of an exact equivalent price for the Bati Raman crude
is not meaningful. Two prices, viz. $15 and $20 per barrel were
used in the analysis. The latter reflects the January 1980, value
of the crude and is considered the base case.
2.   Price Escalation--The base case assumed a 3 percent escalation in real
oil price, i.e. the effective increase over the general inflation.
This escalation reflects both generally accepted economic principles
for pricing a depletable resource and the announced pricing policy
of OPEC. Another case was run without escalation.
3.   Capital Costs--The Dodan gas injection dual porosity capital cost is
assumed to be $145 million.
4.   Drilling and Completion Costs--An oil producing well costs $233,000.  A
CO2 injector/producer costs $455,000.
5.   Operating Costs--The following costs were used:
Oil lifting        $4.00 per bbl
CO2 injection
- from Dodan  $0.09 per Mcf
- recycled    $0.14 per Mcf
These costs were estimated from detailed operating costs supplied
by TPAO and from similar CO2 operations in the USA.
6.   Royalty--The customary 12.5%.
7.   Import Duty and Taxes--None were assumed.



82 -                            ANNEX 6.02
Page 2 of 3
8.   Monetary Unit--All capital and operating cost estimates are in constant
mid-1980 dollars, assuming an annual inflation rate of 12 percent
between the time the estimates were made and mid-1980.
9.   Discount Rate--The base case used 15 percent although 10 percent was
also considered. The overall internal rate of return was calculated.
10.   Economic Limit--The optimal limit of production was found to be 18 years.
ENGINEERING PARAMETERS
1.   Porosity--The base case assumed dual porosity:
Spacing          Porosity            Recovery Time
5 acre             27.2               1830 days
12 acre             23.8               3500 days
20 acre             17.7               1830 days
A single porosity case was also investigated.
2.   Fracture Spacing--Dense fissuring is assumed, with spacing of 1.3 feet
(0.4m).
3.   Critical Gas Saturation--The amount of gas coming out of solution and
displacing oil out of a porous matrix before flow of gas accompanies
the oil is assumed to be 0.15.
4.   Dodan Gas--A review of several analyses indicate that Dodan gas is 91%
CO and that any troublesome residuals of hydrogen sulfide and
waier can be removed. Therefore, the gas is assumed to be identical
to pure CO2 in the simulation. Reserves of 900 Bcf of the gas are
adequate for the Bati Raman field development.
5.   Oil in Place--Bati Raman is assumed to have 1,718 million barrels of oil
in place.
6.   Fracture Porosity--The fraction of a pore volume occupied by the fracture
network was assigned a value of 0.015.
7.   Diffusion Coefficient--The value of 0.012 ft /day was determined by
laboratory diffusion tests and was used in all simulations.
8.   Gravity Segregation--It is assumed that the viscous forces in the dual-
porosity case dominate the gravity forces when combined with the
cyclic stimulation scheme.
9.   Well Spacing--The base case assumed a 20-acre well spacing.  Other cases
which were examined include 2.5-acre and 5-acre well spacing.
10.   Gas Injection--5,000 Mcfd of CO2 was assumed to be injected.
11.   Production Capacity--The base case assumed 1500 reservoir barrels per day.



ANNEX 6.02
- 83 -                           Page 3 of 3
12.   Average Days per Cycle--The base case assumed 55 days per average cycle.
Longer cycle periods permitted a higher ultimate recovery of oil
but at the penalty of a slower, less economical rate.
13.   Plateau Production Rate--It was assumed that the peak production rate of
55,000 BOPD was achieved in the fifth year and continued for ten
years before beginning its decline.
