SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
Borrower:           Republic of Peru
Loan Amount:        US$115 million
Terms:              Repayment in 17 years, including 4 years of grace, at
7.9 percent interest per annum
Loan Description:   The proposed loan would make available US$114.9 million
to help meet foreign exchange requirements for high
priority imports in support of an Economic Recovery
Program (ERP) agreed upon with the Government. The loan
would also finance US$100,000 in'technical assistance.
The counterpart funds generated would help finance priority
public investment projects except that, if warranted by
demand, up to US$15 million in counterpart funds may
be used to establish a dollar denominated revolving fund
to finance imports used in the production of non-traditional
exports. The main risk which the program loan faces is
whether political developments in Peru might impede the
Government's efforts to carry out the stringent ERP.
Estimated
Disbursements:    The loan would be disbursed in four tranches.  US$40
million would be available for disbursement after effec-
tiveness. US$30 million of the loan would be disbursed
after a first review of progress on execution of the ERP
in July 1979 and another US$30 million would be disbursed
after a second performance review in October 1979. The
final US$15 million would be disbursed after a third
performance review, in January 1980. Because 120-day
foreign financing is currently required for most imports,
in order to begin disbursement promptly, goods imported
under licenses issued up to 120 days before signature of
the loan would be eligible for reimbursement provided the
Central Bank has not released foreign currency for this
purpose prior to loan signature.
Procurement
Arrangements:      Only goods purchased from Bank member countries and
Switzerland would be eligible for reimbursement. Purchases
would be on the basis of normal commercial practices,
except that contracts of over US$5 million would be
procured by international competitive bidding. Purchases
of health supplies would be made through the Pan American
Health Organization which buys in large quantities and can,
therefore, obtain favorable prices.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



Consultants:         Up to US$100,000 will be made available from the loan
to finance technical assistance necessary for carrying out
the ERP. About US$30,000 of this will finance the design
of a tax enforcement program. This study is already
underway and approximately US$25,000 used to initiate the
study will be financed retroactively from the proposed
loan.
Appraisal Report:   None.



INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE
PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED PROGRAM LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
program loan to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$115 million.
The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years of grace, with
interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic report entitled "Long-Term Development Issues:  Peru"
(Report No. 2204-PE, dated April 13, 1979) is being distributed to the Executive
Directors. This Part is based on the report's findings as well as those of
the mission which appraised the proposed program loan in December, 1978 and of
a follow-up mission in March, 1979. Annex I contains the basic country data
and a Statistical Appendix is attached as Annex VII.
Background
3.        Peru, the fourth largest country in Latin America, is divided by the
Andes mountains into three distinct regions. The coastal region (the Costa),
constituting about 10 percent of the country's territory, is home for about
46 percent of the population. It consists of a narrow belt of dry plains,
intermittently irrigated valleys and Andean foothills. Modern economic
activity is concentrated in the Costa, particularly in Lima. The Sierra, with
44 percent of the country's population, encompasses the highlands above 2,000
meters which occupy one-fourth of the country. The remaining two-thirds of
the area is occupied by the sparsely populated Selva, vast tropical lowlands
east of the Andes. The rugged topography limits trade between the three
regions.
4.        Peru has abundant natural resources.  These include large deposits
of varied minerals located mainly in the Sierra and the southern coast. Petro-
leum resources, particularly in the jungle areas of the North and offshore,
are believed to be substantial but their full extent has not yet been ascer-
tained. Another major natural resource asset is the large fishing potential
in coastal waters, although the magnitude of this potential is subject to
sharp fluctuations. In contrast to mining and fishing, agricultural land is
limited. Most of the soils suitable for intensive agriculture (3.5 million ha
or 3 percent of the country's total area) are already being farmed. The
remaining land with good agricultural potential is concentrated in higher
parts of the Selva, with high costs of access and land clearance.



-2.-
5.        After three decades of rapidly falling mortality rates (1930-1960)
the rate of population growth had risen to 2.9 percent p.a. Since the early
1960's, birth rates have started a gradual fall, mainly caused by the urban-
ization process and by improved education. But since death rates have also
fallen, population has continued to grow at about 2.9 percent p.a. Since
death rates are expected to continue falling, population growth is likely to
remain at around 2.9 percent p.a. over the next 25 years, unless an effective
demographic policy is adopted. In any case, since there is a lag between the
drop in birth rates and its impact on the growth of working-age population,
the labor force is expected to grow well in excess of 3 percent per year
during the next 15 years.
Past Development Policies
6.        Since the military came to power in 1968, the Government has followed
a development strategy directed at achieving economic growth and at narrowing
the sharp differences in wealth and opportunities between population in various
income classes and geographical regions. The Government has tried to correct
class and regional imbalances by expanding the role of the State in the
economy, changing the pattern of asset ownership, reducing foreign ownership
of national resources, orienting industry and agriculture toward producing
essential goous for the domestic market, stimulating the deconcentration of
economic activity out of Lima, and reforming the educational system to make it
more responsive to local economic and social needs. Through nationalization
and creation of new enterprises, the State has taken direct control of over
150 enterprises in key economic sectors, and its share in total capital
formation has risen from less than one-fourth in 1968-70 to over one half in
1974-76. By imposing complex legislation, the Government has also strictly
controlled the operations of the private sector.
7.        As a result of these actions, the pattern of asset ownership in
the economy has changed drastically. Through nationalization, the share
of assets owned by foreigners fell sharply. A sweeping land reform redistri-
buted 45 percent of the country's best farmlands to workers' cooperatives
benefitting some 25 percent of all rural families. Through other laws,
industrial workers were given shares in the firms which employed them and,
in the mining sector, a share in profits. The Government has also given a
strong autarkic orientation to its agricultural and industrial sector policies
and strengthened the incentives for industries outside of Lima.
8.        The Government's programs have benefitted large numbers of Peruvians,
but they have hardly reached the poorest half of the population which continues
to live in abject poverty.  It is estimated, for example, that 70 to 75 percent
of rural families, including the "minifundistas" (those farming less than 2 ha)
and the seasonal landless workers, have not been reached by social programs.
The Government imposed controls on prices of a number of domestically produced
goods and heavily subsidized imported petroleum and foodstuffs. Most of the
subsidized products, however, were more important in the consumption basket of
the rich than in that of the poorest groups. Moreover, the maintenance of
artificially low prices in some cases--such as meat and cereals--hurt the poor
who produced these items and negatively affected production.



-3-
9.        In the final account, one of the most significant achievements
of the Government was the promotion of the cultural and political integration
of the country. Owing in great part to the land reform, the rural population
has become better organized and able to communicate its priorities in a more
forceful and articulate way. Unfortunately, although many of the policies and
structural changes carried out since 1968 were meant to achiev- rapid growth
and more equality, the cost of these measures proved to be excessive and their
implementation inefficient.
The Present Economic Crisis
10.       The current crisis is the consequence of a combination of external
factors and internal developments. Until 1977, the military Government fol-
lowed expansionary fiscal and credit policies. A rapid increase in spending
by the public sector (including large defense outlays) was not matched by a
parallel increase in revenues. Pricing, interest rate and foreign exchange
policies until 1976 encouraged consumption and discouraged savings, exports
and, sometimes, overall production. As a result of these policies, aggregate
demand considerably exceeded aggregate supply. This excess demand, in turn,
led to widening external gaps and to strong inflationary pressures, with a
resulting loss of international reserves and a massive build-up of external
debt.
11.       This imbalance was aggravated by circumstances beyond the control
of the authorities. Anchovies, the fishing industry's principal product,
virtually disappeared as the annual catch dropped from around 10,000 metric
tons in 1968-71 to an average of 2,300 metric tons in 1975-78. Since 1974,
furthermore, Peru's terms of trade worsened sharply.  Export prices, particu-
larly for copper and sugar (which together accounted for almost one-fourth of
merchandise exports) plummeted at a time when import prices soared. The
terms-of-trade index fell by nearly 30 percent between 1974 and 1978, resulting
in a foreign exchange loss equivalent to US$330 million in the latter year.
Petroleum reserves, which in the early 1970's were predicted to lead to a
quick, major expansion in export earnings, have thus far turned out to be much
less than expected, and with high access cost.
12.       Public sector savings dropped steadily in relation to GDP from
4.4 percent in 1970 to dissavings of 2.6 percent in 1977. A major cause for
this was a massive erosion of the tax base owing to excessive tax incentives,
loopholes in the tax system and weak enforcement. At the same time, there
were rises in the budgetary cost of subsidies for foodstuffs and petroleum
products, and sharp increases in military imports and local expenditures.
Much of public investment, furthermore, was increasingly concentrated on
capital-intensive projects with long gestation periods and little contribution
to the growth of output or employment.

13.       Inflation accelerated from 5 percent per year in 1970 to 38 percent
in 1977. Interest rates on domestic banking system loans, however, remained
substantially negative in real terms, discouraging financial savings and stim-
ulating capital flight. Moreover, the exchange rate remained practically
constant between 1968 and 1975, thus contributing to the overall disequilibrium.
National savings fell dramatically from 16 percent of GNP in 1970 to 8 percent
in 1977, when they financed only about one-half of investment. Following
a period of rapid expansion in 1968-74 during which GDP grew by more than 6
percent per year, the growth rate dropped progressively and became negative in
1977.
14.       The growing disequilibrium described above was reflected in the
balance of payments.  The current account deficit averaged US$1.1 billion per
year in 1974-77, equivalent to nearly 9 percent of GNP. To finance this
deficit, Peru accumulated a massive external debt. Peru's total private
and public external debt--including short-term indebtedness--stood at almost
US$8.3 billion by year end 1977, equivalent to two-thirds of GDP and four
times exports. Much of this debt was contracted on fairly short maturities
with three-fourths of the public sector long-term debt scheduled to be repaid
over the 1978-82 period.



-5-
Stabilization Efforts and The IMF Program
15.        Beginning in 1975 successive economic teams made several efforts to
cope with the mounting economic crisis. A major stabilization program was
initiated in June 1976, when the sol was devalued from SI. 45 to SI. 65 per
U.S. dollar, fiscal and credit policies were tightened and interest rates were
raised . This program was initially successful in reducing the fiscal deficit
and the loss of foreign exchange. Nevertheless, it was abandoned later in the
year as a consequence of strong popular opposition and a lack of consensus
within the Government regarding the gravity of the financial situation.
Further attempts to stablize the economy were initiated in March, July and
September 1977 but they were not successful. A stand-by arrangement was
negotiated with the IMF and approved in November 1977, but its targets were
not met. While these efforts proved to be false starts, they succeeded in
somewhat reducing the gap between national savings and investment from a peak
of 11.5 percent of GNP in 1975 to 8.5 percent in 1976 and 7.4 percent in 1977.
16.        By mid-1978 the economic crisis had reached grave proportions.  The
drop in GDP had intensified and inflation had further accelerated to an annual
rate approaching 100 percent. Moreover, the private sector was finding it
increasingly difficult to open letters of credit for new imports and the
banking system's net international reserves had dropped to a negative level of
US$800 million. This excludes a medium-term US$396 million balance-of-payments
support loan made by commercial banks in 1976 which the Central Bank considers
as a further negative item in its international reserves and which is included
with Peru's external public debt in this President's Report.  It had become
clear that the public sector was fast approaching the point where it would no
longer be able to fully service its external debt. Peru was no longer credit-
worthy. Financial instability had reached the point that practically all
economic activities were adversely affected.
17.       A new economic team was named in May 1978.  Since then, the Govern-
ment has adopted a number of important measures aimed at strengthening public
finances, stimulating exports and stemming the loss of international reserves.
By means of a crawling peg, the sol was devalued from S/. 130 to the U.S.
dollar in May to almost S/. 200 to the U.S. dollar by year-end 1978. Most
subsidies were eliminated, thus closing an important drain on public savings.
Other price controls were relaxed. In addition, a number of tax measures were
adopted and Government expenditures were restrained. Interest rates on bank
loans were raised from 16 to 31.5 percent per year. Peru reached agreement
with foreign commercial banks to reschedule US$185 million of principal
payments due in the second half of 1978 until January 1979. The Government
also negotiated a new stand-by arrangement which was approved by the IMF on
September 15. Finally, it refinanced the bulk of the public external debt
due in 1979 and 1980.
18.        The Government's program, supported by the stand-by, aims at a
dramatic improvement in public sector finances in 1979. Public sector current
account savings are to rise from -1 percent of GDP in 1978 to 5.6 percent of
GDP in 1979. To this end, the Government has adopted a 1979 budget that aims
at a 10 percent real increase in tax revenues, while severely holding down
current outlays. Payments for wages and salaries are budgeted to fall by some



-6-
12 percent in real terms, partly as a result of a planned reduction in excessive
civil service employment. The elimination of subsidies on food and petroleum
products, initiated in mid-1978, will further contribute to the control of
current expenditures. The largest cut, almost 40 percent in real terms,
is for defense outlays. On the revenue side, measures already adopted--includ-
ing a 10 percent import surcharge, a higher tax on traditional exports and an
increased tax on interest charged on bank loans--are expected to permit
attainment of the revenue target. On the other hand, real capital expenditures
are budgeted to rise by over 20 percent, as analyzed in Part II. Inflation,
which averaged 73.5 percent in 1978 (December 1977 to December 1978), is
targeted to drop to 40 percent in 1979.
19.       The stand-by has formal quantitative requirements affecting net
domestic banking system credit to the non-financial public sector, net domestic
credit granted by the Central Bank, the build-up of Central Bank net interna-
tional reserves, and net foreign borrowing by the public sector on maturities
of up to ten years. In drawing up quantitative ceilings and targets, the
stand-by took into account a certain level of expected balance of payments
support from various sources, including a Bank program loan, in 1979. Further-
more, the stand-by establishes that the Central Bank's international reserves
target is to be adjusted in case actual 1979 balance of payments support is
different from the assumed total amount. Peru's debt outstanding to the IMF
as of April 30, 1979, is expected to reach SDR 440 million distributed as
follows: (i) SDR 123 million under the Compensatory Financing Facility;
(ii) SDR 53 million under the Oil Facility; and (iii) SDR 264 million under
tranche policies. The last item includes SDR 44 million disbursed under the
present stand-by. The stand-by also provides for an additional SDR 140
million to be disbursed between May 1979 and December 1980. A Fund team will
visit Peru in late April 1979 to conduct Article IV consultations. This team
will also discuss Peru's possible access to the recently established Supple-
mentary Financing Facility. Peru's present drawings under the tranche policies
are within the third credit tranche.
Debt Restructuring
20.       Major debt-relief operations carried out in late 1978 enabled Peru
to reduce substantially the debt-service burden for 1979 and 1980, postponing
it to the 1982-1986 period. In May 1978, the Soviet Union rescheduled the
equivalent of about US$140 million of maturities originally due in 1978-80.
These amounts are to be repaid over a 10-year period including three years of
grace. In November at a Paris Club meeting, the OECD countries agreed to
reschedule 90 percent of principal payments due by the public sector to
governments and guaranteed suppliers in 1979 (US$250 million) and 1980 (US$263
million). These amounts are to be repaid over a period of eight years,
including three years of grace. The Paris Club agreement states that 1980
maturities will be rescheduled provided that Peru agrees with the IMF, by
December 31, 1979, on a financial program for 1980. The Paris Club creditors
also agreed to reschedule 90 percent of the principal payments due in 1979 and
1980 (about US$30 million in each year) on private sector debt guaranteed or
insured in the creditor countries. In addition, Peru is in the process of
negotiating similar debt relief with non-OECD countries. This includes Latin
American Governments (US$57 million in 1979 and US$28 million in 1980) and
East European countries (about US$30 million in each year).



-7-
21.       As regards the large medium-term public debt to commercial banks,
an agreement concluded in December 1978 provides that Peru will repay, in
1979, the bulk of the US$185 million rolled over from 1978 (para. 17 above).
The banks will refinance 90 percent of the maturities due in 1979 (US$321
million) to be repaid between 1982 and 1986. The commercial banks considered
the program loan an important part of the overall economic rec^very effort
and, therefore, made the Bank program loan a condition of this refinancing
agreement. The agreement implies that the commercial banks would reduce their
exposure in Peru's public debt by almost US$200 million in 1979, equivalent
to about one-tenth of the debt owed them as of year-end 1978. Practically all
of this reduction, however, would result from delayed repayment of loans
initially due in 1978. As far as debt originally due in 1979 is concerned,
the commercial banks have accepted terms similar to those negotiated at the
Paris Club. The agreement reached between the Government of Peru and the
commercial banks also gives the Government the option of refinancing part
of the maturities currently due in 1980.
Social Situation
22.       The economic crisis of recent years has been reflected in two conse-
cutive years of negative growth. Total GDP fell by 1.2 percent in 1977 and
a further 1.6 percent in 1978. In this two-year period GDP per capita dropped
by over 8 percent. This situation, in turn, has been reflected in incomes and
employment. Nearly one-half of Peru's labor force is believed to be unemployed
or underemployed, i.e., earning less than the minimum wage or working less
than 35 hours a week and wishing to work more. According to government esti-
mates, the purchasing power of salaries had fallen 40 percent by 1978 compared
to 1970 and that of wages by over 16 percent. In these circumstances, the
social situation has been unavoidably tense, and several general strikes have
taken place during the past year.
23.       The military Government has formulated a political calendar that
calls for general elections and the transfer of authority to a civilian
Government within the next year. An elected Constituent Assembly, in which
the major political parties are represented, is completing the drafting of a
new constitution. At present the authorities are maintaining an informal
dialogue with the leaders of these parties in an effort to ensure the contin-
uity of economic policies following the political transition.
PART II - THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROGRAM
24.       With the financial stabilization program and the debt restructuring
described in Part I, the Government has begun to close the fiscal and external
gaps. These efforts, however, have not yet helped to overcome the deep
economic recession. To this end the Government has conceived an Economic
Recovery Program (ERP) which would reverse the decline in GDP and lay a basis
for a financially sound economic recovery. The ERP includes, in addition to
the above-mentioned stabilization actions, measures to open up the economy,
stimulate industrial sector efficiency, promote non-traditional exports,
strengthen the tax system by broadening its base, and generally improve the
efficiency of resource allocation in the private and public sectors. A summary
description of the ERP is set forth at the end of Part II.



-8-
a.   Opening Up the Economy and Stimulating Industrial Efficiency
25.       The Government has begun to dismantle the absolute, non-tariff
protection granted by the National Registry of Manufacturers (RNM). As
explained in Part III, under previous legislation the RNM prohibited the
import of manufactured products that compete with those produced in Peru.
This absolute protection has already been eliminated for about one-half of the
products previously included in the RNM. The Government intends to complete
this process within two years and to replace import prohibitions by a reason-
able tariff. This is expected to stimulate greater industrial efficiency,
lead to generally lower prices for consumers and contribute to the expansion
of non-traditional exports.
26.       A Government team, working with Bank technical assistance, is
formulating a new import tariff that should rationalize and generally reduce
tariff protection. As explained in Part III, the new tariff structure would
be enacted in July 1979 and gradually implemented over a four and one-half
year period. On average, effective protection for manufactured products would
be cut by about one half. This action would complement and strengthen the
positive effects of dismantling non-tariff protection described in the preced-
ing paragraph.
b.   Promoting Non-Traditional Exports
27.       One of the most important elements of the ERP is a correction of
the anti-export bias that has contributed to the present crisis. To this end,
a realistic foreign exchange policy was adopted in mid-1978 (paragraph 17).
The Government's policy is to maintain the real exchange rate at the present
level. This is to be attained by means of a crawling peg.
28.       In addition to adopting an export-stimulating exchange rate, the
Government has recently enacted a new non-traditional exports promotion law
which streamlines export procedures, guarantees the continuation of existing
incentives and establishes new incentives (discussed in Part III).
c.   Strengthening the Tax System
29.       The Government has recently adopted--and continues to design and
introduce--a number of tax measures aimed at broadening the tax base and improv-
ing the equity and allocative effectiveness of the tax system. These include
redesigning the personal income tax (brackets, deductions and exemptions) to
broaden its coverage, establishing minimum presumptive incomes for independent
professionals and taking into account personal assets to estimate a minimum
taxable income. Corporate income taxes and taxes on wealth are being rede-
signed to reduce loopholes and to continuously adjust assessments in line with
inflation. Other measures to be adopted during 1979 include: (i) reducing
the presently large number of minor special taxes; (ii) streamlining collection
procedures for the remaining special taxes; and (iii) extending the coverage
of the value-added tax. In addition, the Government has begun to adopt
measures aimed at improving tax administration and at reducing widespread
evasion. For all these purposes the Bank is providing technical assistance,
which would be financed under the proposed program loan.



_9
d.   Interest Rate Policy
30.       The Government has already taken significant steps to reduce the gap
between inflation and interest rates. As indicated in Part I, the basic bank
lending rate was raised from 16 percent per year in July 1978 to 31.5 percent
in December. While this was still below the average rate of inflation in
1978, the Government action represents a determination to reach and maintain
realistic financial policies. In early February, a further adjustment was
made and the tax on interest rate charges (paid by the borrower) was raised
from 10 to 17 percent. As commercial banks tend to discount part of the
interest charges from short-term loans (i.e. part of the interest charges are
paid in advance) and also charge commissions, the effective cost of prime
loans actually exceeds 45 percent. Because inflation is expected to slow down
to 40 percent in 1979, the authorities prefer to hold interest rates at present
levels for the time being. The Government will, however, review interest rates
on a quarterly basis, and the intention of the monetary authorities is to
reach positive real levels--including taxes and other charges to the borrower--
before the end of 1979.
e.   Public Investment Program
31.       Public investment in the late 1960s and early 1970s averaged around
4-5 percent of GDP. Investment began to increase rapidly starting in 1973 and
rose to a peak of 8.5 percent of GDP in 1975. However, several of the large
scale projects undertaken as part of this expanded investment program were
not economically justified. Such projects have contributed to Peru's current
economic difficulties by absorbing a large amount of financial resources
and indebtedness capacity without making a significant contribution to the
country's economic development.
32.       The 1978-1982 Medium-Term Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP) is
the product of a process of close consultation between the Government and the
Bank (see Annex VII for a summary of the PSIP). The 1979 investment budget is
in line with this program. Because of the country's serious fiscal problems,
the Government has put great emphasis on optimum utilization of the limited
resources available for investment. Fixed investment expenditures in the
PSIP, equivalent to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1978, would rise to 7.4 percent in
1979 with assistance from the proposed program loan and to 8.5 percent in the
1980-82 period. New projects which did not have clear economic justification
or whose implementation periods were so long that they would contribute little
to the current recovery effort have been postponed or eliminated. Although
the program still contains several marginal projects because their execution
is well advanced and because they are politically important (i.e. the Majes
Irrigation/Power project and the Cajamarquilla Zinc refinery), their 1979
investment levels have been cut back. On balance, the Government has made
good progress in developing an investment program which concentrates scarce
resources on those projects most likely to provide benefits in the near term

or resolve critical structural problems. In drawing up the 1978-82 PSIP, the
Government has pursued the following objectives:
(i) to accelerate execution of on-going projects (see Part IV for
a description of actions taken on Bank financed projects);
(ii) to begin to redirect new investment towards high yielding small-
and medium-sized projects which promise a relatively rapid
economic return; and
(iii) to give greater priority to investment in transport and power
where serious problems are developing because of underinvestment
in the past years.
The PSIP's main features are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Productive Sectors
33.       Productive sector investment represents about 48 percent of total
public investment and concentrates on continued development of agriculture
and mining, the country's most important natural resources. This is a sig-
nificant reduction from the 75 percent level of the 1975-76 period, when such
large scale projects as an oil pipeline and newsprint plant were under con-
struction.  With the completion of these projects and the elimination or
postponement of a number of large new operations, greater emphasis will be
given to completing on-going projects, increasing power and transport invest-
ment and initiating smaller directly productive projects with relatively short
payback periods.
34.       The agricultural sector accounts for about 16 percent of public fixed
investment in the 1979-82 period, the largest sectoral allocation except for
the electric power sector. The strategy for agriculture is (i) to continue
development and rehabilitation of irrigated coastal areas; (ii) to begin an
effort to develop the potentially rich jungle highlands, or Ceja de Sierra,
east of the Andes; and (iii) to introduce smaller high yield projects. Also,
it was agreed that the Government would provide US$40 million equivalent in
1979 to the National Agricultural Bank to expand its agricultural credit program
(Sections l.Ol(m) and (n) and 5.01 of the draft Loan Agreement). Finally, the
Government has requested Bank assistance to test an integrated rural development
approach for the agrarian reform communities in the Sierra.
35.       A number of major coastal irrigation works are to be financed in the
1979-82 period including the continuation of the Chira-Piura project in
the north, for which the Bank is considering a loan (see Part IV below),
and the dual purpose Majes power/irrigation project. Together these projects
account for 72 percent of the public investment program in agriculture for
1979. All except Majes are being carried out in important existing agricul-
tural areas where there is already significant infrastructure.
36.       The Majes project, begun in 1973, accounts for over 30 percent of
public investment in agriculture in 1979-82 period. It has absorbed expendi-
tures of about US$330 million to date and is expected to cost an additional
US$1.2 billion in constant 1978 dollars by the time it is completed in the
late 1980s. There has never been a complete economic analysis of this project.



- 11 -
However, in view of its expected benefits in relation to its cost, it appears
that its economic return will, at best, be marginal. Because of its political
significance (it will benefit the important Arequipa area) and the substantial
amount already expended on the project, the Government is not prepared to
terminate it. It has, however, held down expenditures for the project in 1979
to US$34 million, which is below the 1978 level, despite a requested budget of
US$65 million. The Government will also complete an economic analysis of the
project this year in order to optimize project phasing.
37.       To assist the Government in the development of a sound agricultural
lending program that is responsive to the needs of the economy, a Bank sector
mission will visit Peru this year to continue the dialogue begun in the
context of preparation of the proposed program loan.
38.       The mining sector would account for almost 15 percent of public
investment in the 1979-82 period. As in the agricultural sector, most of the
major projects being undertaken are economically justified expansions of
existing installations. These include a major expansion of the Cobriza Copper
mine being financed by the Bank and the IDB and the second phases of several
other copper projects.
39.       The only entirely new project is the Cajamarquilla zinc refinery
whose construction in the Lima area began last year. This project, which is
highly capital and energy intensive, is expected to cost about US$200 million.
An economic analysis indicates that the project is marginal even when optimistic
assumptions regarding project cost and the price of electricity are used. But
its construction has begun, a substantial amount has been invested and cancel-
lation of the project now would result in large financial penalties. The
Government will, nevertheless, slow down project execution in 1979.
40.       Since the Government intends to rely increasingly on private invest-
ment and mixed enterprises to develop mineral resources, there are no new
large scale mining projects in the PSIP in the 1979-82 period. The Government
has, however, included in the PSIP medium sized and economically attractive
expansions of three mines to increase the production of silver and other
metals.
41.       At this time, the petroleum sector investment program would only
continue on-going activities and secondary recovery operations in the Talara
and Selva areas. Because of its financial difficulties, PETROPERU, the
national oil company, is currently not in a position to undertake any major
new investment.  In view of the oil production potential in the selva area,
however, a somewhat more ambitious development program should be planned.  A
Bank mission visited Peru recently to discuss with the Government an expanded
sector investment program.
42.       The investment program for the industrial sector has been reduced
substantially for the 1979-82 period. A number of very large projects have
been dropped from the PSIP, and the government is trying to encourage greater
private sector participation. Substantial cutbacks in public investment
are also proposed for other productive sectors. In both fishing, where a
large investment program has been carried out in recent years, and tourism the
emphasis is on completion of projects which are well advanced.



- 12 -
Infrastructure
43.       The level of investment in infrastructure has been declining over
the past ten years. The power and transport sectors were particularly
hard-hit. In transport, few new road projects have been started and road
maintenance and rehabilitation have lagged badly. The result has been a
significant deterioration in the country's roads and little expansion of the
overall road network which is one of the more inadequate ones in Latin America.
In electric energy, the country faces the possibility of serious shortages
over the next decade because new investment projects have not been started at
a sufficient rate.
44.       These serious problems are addressed in the PSIP.  Infrastructure
investment for the 1979-82 period would be increased to about 35 percent
of public investment, primarily as a result of increases in road and electric
power investment. In transport, only one major new road project will be
started. This will allow for the prompt completion of projects now underway
and for a road maintenance and improvement budget which will be adequate for
the first time in many years. In electric power, the increase will permit the
initiation of several new hydro and transmission line projects to help meet
projected growth in demand. An optimizatior study for all the electrical
systems of Peru is now underway and should be completed by the end of the
year. On this basis, the Government will be in a position to develop an
adequate power sector investment program for the coming years.
45.       Finally, with financing from the Bank's recent Water Supply and
Power Engineering Loan (S-ll of December 22, 1978), final studies are beginning
on a water transfer project which would insure adequate water supply for Lima
through the end of the century and also provide the basis for a large scale
hydroelectric project. The PIP includes these projects for initiation in the
early 1980s.
Social Sectors
46.       Investment in health, housing, education and other social projects
would account for about 13 percent of public investment in the 1979-82 period.
This represents a needed increase from recent years when investment in these
sectors had fallen to around 10 percent of total public investment. In health,
there has been emphasis on hospital construction while primary care and pre-
ventive programs have been allowed to lag with serious health consequences. A
Bank mission recently visited Peru to begin exploring sectoral problems and
needs. Programs to provide public services for low-income urban areas will
continue to receive priority.  Finally, in education the PSIP continues to
give priority to the educational reform which the Bank has been assisting with
its first education loan.
Conclusion
47.       The 1979-82 PSIP is a significant improvement over public investment
in the early and mid-seventies and in general reflects a major Government
effort to allocate scarce resources to projects that respond to Peru's invest-
ment needs. It is essentially a sound program although further improvements



-13 -
in it are possible, particularly in identifying or firming up attractive new
investment possibilities in the PIP's outer years. The Bank will work closely
with the Government in this task. In this regard, the Peruvian authorities
will update the PSIP towards the end of 1979 and the Bank would review it in
the context of its monitoring of the ERP (Section 3.06 and Schedule 5 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
Financing Public Investment
48.       The recovery of public fixed investment in the 1979-82 period from
its sharp drop in 1977-78 is predicated on a significant improvement in public
sector savings and a renewed flow of external assistance.

b!   The "Amortization on External Debt" figures for 1979 and 1980 include
amounts originally scheduled to be repaid in these years but which were
rescheduled in late 1978. The Government's policy is to have the public
sector pay these amounts into a special Central Bank account according
to the original schedule. The purpose of maintaining this account is
to ensure fiscal restraint in 1979-80. The Central Bank will use these
Soles to purchase foreign exchange and thus help replenish Peru's inter-
national reserves.



- 14 -
49.       As shown in Table 2, public sector savings are expected to rise from
one percent of GDP in 1978 to five percent in 1979, which is in line with the
stand-by program. Thereafter, savings would remain at the 5-6 percent level
through 1982. This expectation is based mainly upon what has already been
achieved in eliminating public sector price subsidies and in reducing Central
Government expenditures, particularly for defense. Recourse to domestic
borrowing during the 1979-82 period would be considerably below the 1976-77
levels and is also consistent with the stand-by for 1979.
50.       No significant new external borrowing is expected in 1979 except for
electric power where there is an urgent need to begin projects and for an
irrigation scheme which is being financed with a soft loan from Germany.
Disbursements of existing external loans should, however, accelerate in 1979
with the expansion of local resources made available by the proposed program
loan. Thereafter, new commitments of external loans are projected to average
about US$420 million annually in order to help finance the PSIP. This level
of external assistance is feasible given Peru's improving creditworthiness.
f.   Balance of Payments and Creditworthiness
51.       The improved economic management since mid 1978 has led to a marked
turnaround in balance of payments performance.  The resource gap, which had
reached nearly 5 percent of GDP in 1977, turned into a surplus in 1978 and
the drop in net international reserves of recent years has been reversed.
This was mainly due to a drop in imports--owing to the economic recession--but
lower defense purchases also contributed significantly. Non-traditional exports
rose owing mainly to the adoption of a more realistic exchange rate, which led
to strong export growth. The capital account, in turn, strengthened owing to
the beginning of debt relief operations and to some repatriation of Peruvian
capital.
52.       The Government's program is expected to lead to strong balance of
payments performances in 1979 and 1980, which is essential for economic recovery
and to restore net international reserves, now at negative levels. This will
be achieved by continuing to maintain an export-oriented foreign exchange
policy, realistic interest rates and by the promotion of non-traditional
exports. The Peruvian Government has also undertaken to improve foreign debt
management by, inter alia, making use of aid from official bilateral and
international donors to the extent possible. Moreover, the bulk of Peru's
public debt due to commercial banks in 1980 is expected to be refinanced along
the lines of the agreement reached for 1979 (para. 21). Furthermore, most of
Peru's large foreign short-term debt (estimated at over US$2 billion as of
year-end 1978) is expected to be rolled over or refinanced as the gradually
improving economic situation permits new trade-related credit lines to be opened.
The trade balance should also be strengthened by a further sharp drop in military
imports in 1979 and by the emergence, for the first time, of a net petroleum
surplus for export. The recent completion of the Trans-Andean pipeline should
allow Peru to export an average of nearly 80,000 barrels per day in 1979-82,
adding some US$500 million per year to gross export earnings. Even though about
one half the projected gross petroleum exports would leave the country as profit
remittances, this still implies a major improvement over recent years when Peru
was spending in excess of US$200 million per year on fuel imports. On balance,
although Peru can be expected to enter the 1980's with a strong trade surplus,
its balance of payments situation will still be tight as evidenced by the fact
that net international reserves would hover around zero.



- 15 -
53.                  In the early eighties, if economic activity recovers to an annual
growth rate of 5 to 6 percent, the imports needed for sustaining the develop-
ment effort may exceed somewhat the pace of exports. This is particularly so
because the exportable petroleum surplus may start to decline in 1982 unless
important new discoveries are made soon. In addition, the debt restructured
in 1978-80 will impose a heavy payment burden in 1981-86. Balance of payments
support will likely continue to be needed, therefore, in the early 1980s unless
a further debt restructuring operation takes place. Assuming the ERP is
successfully carried out, Peru's medium term balance of payments situation is
expected to be tight but manageable.
54.                 Table 3 below contains balance of payments projections for Peru.  It
is followed on page 16 by a summary of the ERP's key features.

PART III - THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Growth and Structure
55.       Peru's manufacturing sector is small but quite diversified.
Manufacturing value added accounts for about 21 percent of total GNP, but
the sector employs a much smaller share of the country's economically active
population, about 5 percent. A substantial proportion of manufactured
output originates outside the traditional consumer goods industries. The
shares of food, beverages, tobacco, textiles, clothing, leather and footwear
have been decreasing over time and currently account for only 40 percent of
total manufactured output. Intermediate industries--particularly chemical
products and metals--on the other hand, are growing in importance.
56.       Manufacturing value added grew substantially during the 1960s
and early 1970s, with average growth rates of 8.5 percent per annum from 1960
to 1974.  This rate of growth was well above the 5.5 percent experienced by
GDP during the same period. Industrial growth was induced mainly by sharply
growing domestic demand for industrial products--fueled by rising incomes and
government redistribution policies after 1970--and was based on import substi-
tution. When Peru's economic activity began to slow down in 1975, industrial
growth dropped to 5.4 percent in 1975 and 4.8 percent in 1976. As the economic
crisis became more severe in 1977, physical industrial output decreased by 6.5
percent and continued falling in 1978 with a further decrease of 3.2 percent
in the index of industrial production.
Import Dependence
57.       The direct import component of industrial output (packaging, raw
materials and intermediate goods) has averaged 20 percent during the 1971-1976
period with a constantly increasing trend. Thus, in 1976 imported industrial
inputs came to about US$750 million, accounting for 24 percent of industrial
output. During the last two years, the acute shortage of foreign exchange has
forced imports of industrial inputs to remain approximately constant in nominal
terms, adding another limitation to the already depressed manufacturing sector.
In 1979, availability of sufficient foreign exchange to meet the imported
input requirements of the industrial sector will be a crucial element in
determining the sector's overall performance, particularly the growth of
manufactured exports.
Protection from Imports
58.       Tariff protection in Peru has been constantly increasing during
the last two decades. In 1958 the unweighted average of nominal official
tariffs was 38 percent. It increased to 42 percent in 1964, 55 percent in
1967 and 69 percent in 1973 by which date Peruvian tariff protection ranked
highest among all Andean Group member countries. Since 1973, no major changes
have taken place in the tariff system although the use of a mixed system
combining specific and ad-valorem rates, together with a growing exchange rate
overvaluation, has produced some reductions in total tariff protection.



- 18 -
59.       While the protective impact of the tariffs was somewhat eroded,
non-tariff protection--operating through a complex system including import
licenses, prohibitions, state monopolies and the National Register of
Manufactures (RNM)--offered more protection than tariffs during the last
decade. In 1978, one third of the total number of items in the customs
classification were included in the RNM and thus received practically unlimited
protection. The cost of non-tariff protection has been very high. In 1973,
for example, domestic prices for 100 products subject to import prohibition or
included in the RNM increased by 40 percent compared with an overall price
increase of only 9.5 percent in the same year.
60.       The combined effects of tariff and non-tariff protection have given
high levels of effective protection to Peruvian industry. Effective protection
from tariffs alone averaged 90 percent for the goods produced by the manufac-
turing sector.
Export Incentives
61.       The Peruvian Government started to actively promote exports of
manufactures in 1968, establishing a tax credit certificate (CERTEX), at a
flat rate of 15 percent of the FOB value of exports. In 1972 there was an
increase in the CERTEX rates and two new mechanisms were set up:  (i) the
Non-Traditional Exports Financing Fund (FENT) of the Banco Industrial del Peru
(BIP) to help finance the production and sale of non-traditional export
products; and (ii) the Export Credit Insurance scheme to protect exporters
against political, commercial and other exports risks. Between 1972 and 1976,
there were only minor changes in the non-traditional exports promotion system.
In mid-1976 an increase in CERTEX rates and a devaluation of the sol shortly
afterwards, facilitated an increase in exports.
62.       Financing for exports of non-traditional products is provided
by FENT. Loans are made to exporters either directly by BIP or through
commercial banks and are available in local or in foreign currency, depending
on the kind of operation and the origin of FENT resources. Total available
resources for pre-shipment financing (FENT's most important activity) as of
December 15, 1978 were about US$34 million equivalent in local currency and
US$10.5 million in foreign currency.
63.       While the total volume of FENT resources grew substantially in the
last two years, it failed to keep up with the high rate of growth of non-
traditional exports, covering less than 40 percent of the total in 1978. As a
result, the availability of export credit has been a constraint to further
export growth. To overcome this constraint, the Government has agreed to pro-
vide FENT with an additional US$20 million equivalent in 1979 (Sections 1.01(m)
and (n) and 5.01 of the draft Loan Agreement).
64.       On November 21, 1978 the Government approved a new Non-Traditional
Exports Promotion Law which incorporates all export incentives discussed above
and establishes a new set of fiscal incentives, export promotion activities,
and greater flexibility under the existing labor legislation. The law's major
provisions with respect to existing incentives include (i) the continuation of
the CERTEX mechanism for ten years; and (ii) the establishment of a one
percent surcharge on most imports to be allocated to the FENT. During 1979,



-19 -
the surcharge is expected to increase FENT resources by about US$6.5 million.
Enactment of the Law demonstrates the Government's determination to support
the exporting sector and has been very favorably received by the Exporters'
Association.
Industrial Capacity Utilization
65.       During the last decade, industrial legislation increased indirect
labor costs, lowered the relative cost of capital with respect to labor and
created incentives to reinvest profits and expand installed capacity. A
recent study estimates that during the 1970-1975 period, real installed
industrial capacity grew by 62 percent, with investment in machinery and
equipment increasing at a real annual rate of 25 percent. However, industrial
output grew at an annual rate of only 6.5 percent during the same period.
66.       After 1975, decreasing levels of domestic demand led to low capacity
utilization in most manufacturing industries. While serious underutilization
became widespread, certain industries were particularly hard hit and were
operating at only 40 to 60 percent of capacity by 1976. These included the
furniture, footwear, printing and publishing, shipbuilding, motorcycle,
bicycle, leather products and clothing industries. Capacity utilization
continued to drop through 1978, as overall industrial production contracted.
Recent Export Trends
67.       Peru's non traditional exports rose in 1976 to US$137 million
as a result of a devaluation of the sol, the increased level of CERTEX and
other export incentives, the recovery in world markets and domestic recession.
The increase continued during 1977 with non-traditional exports reaching
US$238 million. In 1978, exports of non-traditional products reached an
estimated US$340 million of which about US$280 million were manufactures.
68.       The most important non-traditional exports are food products (mainly
frozen and canned fish), textiles and clothing, non-ferrous metals, chemicals
and transport equipment (mainly fishing boats). Until 1976, the single most
important subsector was food products which contributed slightly above 25
percent of the total, followed by textiles and clothing with another 25
percent. In 1977, the share of textiles and clothing jumped to about 32
percent of the total. Copper wire accounts for about 50 percent of total
non-ferrous metals exports. Exports of fishing boats (US$8.2 million in 1976
and more than US$20 million in 1977) consist mainly of tuna, anchovy and
shrimp boats exported to other Latin American countries including Mexico,
Colombia, Chile and Panama. Exports of other metal products and machinery
are limited to a few items, including electric transformers, telephone cables
steel wire and drilling machines going to the Andean Market under preferential
schemes. Exports of wood products have also been growing very rapidly in
the last two years.



- 20 -
69.       About half of Peruvian non-traditional exports are directed to
other Latin American countries. Between 1970 and 1976, Andean Group countries
alone accounted for over 25 percent of non-traditional exports followed by
the EEC (20 percent) and the United States (15 percent). Remaining exports
are directed to other European countries and Japan.
Sectoral Outlook and the Government's Economic Recovery Program
70.       The ERP includes as one of its key elements a complete reformulation
of industrial policies, particularly industrial (tariff and non-tariff)
protection and export promotion policies (through the recently approved
Non-Traditional Exports Promotion Law).
71.       A detailed timetable of policy measures has been prepared with the
assistance of Bank staff.  It includes dismantling--over a period of two years,
beginning in January 1979--the quantitative (non-tariff) protection granted
by the RNM. This process has already begun and the Government will make
further adjustments every six months until December 31, 1981, by which date
non-tariff import restrictions will have been completely eliminated. The Bank
will review progress in this area in connection with the proposed program loan
(Section 3.06 and Schedule 5 of the draft Loan Agreement).
72.       As mentioned in paragraph 26, a Government team is also preparing
a new import tariff law that would rationalize and generally reduce tariff
protection. The new tariff is expected to be proposed in June 1979, enacted
in July 1979 and gradually implemented over a four and one-half year period.
Under the new tariff, average effective protection would decrease from the
present 90 percent to 50 percent. Moreover, protection would not exceed
90 percent for any category of goods. Adoption of the law, which the Bank
would monitor in accordance with Section 3.06 and Schedule 5 of the draft Loan
Agreement, would constitute a satisfactory starting point for the Peruvian
tariff reform exercise.
73.       As a result of the export promotion measures and the greater avail-
ability of foreign exchange for imports, the manufacturing sector is expected
to begin to recover in 1979, mainly in several intermediate subsectors such as
fishmeal, paper, wood products, industrial chemicals, oil, china and porcelain,
non-metallic minerals and metals. The sector's recovery is expected to
continue in 1980, when the consumer and capital goods industries--those with
the lowest present levels of capacity utilization--would also start to grow.
On balance, the manufacturing sector is expected to expand by 4.5 percent in
1980.
74.       Non-traditional export growth is expected to continue in 1979
as a result of the recent policy measures, the increased availability of
export credit from FENT and the continuation of a realistic foreign exchange
policy. Total non-traditional exports are expected to reach about US$450
million in 1979, of which more than US$400 million would be manufactures.



- 21 -
PART IV - THE PROGRAM LOAN
75.       The proposed loan and the economic recovery program it supports
have been developed through a close and continuing dialogue between the Bank
and the Government, which began with a June 1978 Bank mission. At that time,
the Government requested Bank consideration of a program loan in view of
the critical economic situation. A program loan was seen by the Government
and the IMF as an important supporting element for the stabilization and debt
restructuring programs and for the economic recovery effort. It was therefore
built into the stand-by agreement and became part of the Government's monetary
and financial programs for 1979.
76.      The Government has, with Bank assistance, gone beyond short term
measures and formulated the ERP described in Part II and the Government's
Letter of Intent (see Annex IV) to begin to deal with structural problems in
the areas of industrial policy and export promotion; tax policy and administra-
tion; interest rate policy and public investment. Development of the proposed
loan has thus become an effective vehicle for a far reaching dialogue on
economic policy between the Government and the Bank which has contributed
to the adoption of a strong and ambitious economic recovery program.
77.       In spite of recent improvements, Peru must still deal with a serious
balance of payments and fiscal situation and high levels of unemployment. Net
international reserves were negative by US$623 million at the end of 1978 and
there was a serious shortage of resources to continue development projects.
Furthermore, much of the country's industrial plant capacity remained idle.
In this context, the proposed program loan would provide financing for essen-
tial imports, primarily for the private sector. It would also help ease the
balance of payments and domestic credit situation, and make it possible for
capacity utilization and industrial employment to rise. In addition, through
the allocation of counterpart funds, the program loan would enable Peru to
reach a level of public investment required for its recovery in the medium
term.
78.       The loan was appraised in December 1978 and negotiations were held
in Washington from March 29 to April 3, 1979. The Peruvian delegation was
headed by Mr. Raul Salazar, Manager of the Central Bank.
Allocation of the Program Loan
79.       All but US$100,000 of the loan would be used to help finance
imports of industrial raw materials, intermediate goods and spare parts;
agricultural, electric generating, mining, and forestry equipment and spare
parts; and inputs for on-going preventive health programs. Industrial inputs
would constitute over 80 percent of the imports financed. Priority will be
given to industries with underutilized capacity and the potential to generate
exports with significant local value added. Annex VI contains the agreed upon
list of eligible imports. It is estimated that imports of raw materials and
intermediate goods in 1979 will total over US$900 million, so that the proposed
loan would finance only about 10 percent of the total import bill, thus ensuring
rapid disbursement.



- 22 -
80.       Up to US$100,000 would be made available from the proposed loan
to finance technical assistance necessary for carrying out the ERP. The
Government plans to spend about US$30,000 to finance the design of a tax
enforcement program which is now underway; approximately US$25,000 used to
initiate the study would be financed retroactively under the proposed loan.
The balance of the US$100,000 would be used to finance such additional assis-
tance as may be agreed upon by the Government and the Bank (Section 3.03 of
the draft Loan Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
81.       The loan would be disbursed in four tranches.  US$40 million would
be available for disbursement after the loan is declared effective. US$30
million of the loan would be disbursed after a first performance review in
July. An additional US$30 million would be available for disbursement after
a second performance review in October. The final US$15 million would be
disbursed after a final performance review, in January 1980. Two weeks before
each of these missions, the Borrower would submit a report detailing its
progress in carrying out the ERP (Section 3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
82.       The supervision missions undertaking these reviews would, with the
support and assistance of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, make a judgement as to whether progress had been adequate in carrying
out the ERP described in Part II above and Annex V particularly in regard to
adherence to the stabilization program, adoption and implementation of policy
measures, and execution of the 1979 PSIP (Section 3.06 and Schedule 5 of the
draft Loan Agreement). These elements would be monitored carefully in view of
the difficulties the Government has had in the past in following through on
economic recovery actions. In addition to the ERP, the Government has presented
in its Letter of Intent medium-term projections of economic performance in key
areas. These targets would provide the context within which the Bank and
Government would discuss the direction and rate of improvement in the economic
situation.
83.       The proposed loan would reimburse the CIF cost of eligible imports
on the basis of evidence that they were paid for by the Central Bank and
imported. Import licensing in Peru is automatic for all goods on the Permitted
Import List; however, a minimum 120 days foreign financing is currently required
for most goods that would be imported under the proposed loan. This will be
reduced to 90 days after July 1, 1979 and, in accordance with the requirements
of the stand-by, will be eliminated in 1980. Because of the 120-day financing
requirement, in order to begin disbursement of the proposed loan promptly,
goods imported under licenses issued up to 120 days before signature of the
loan would be eligible for reimbursement provided the Central Bank has not
released foreign currency in payment thereof prior to loan signature.
84.       The Central Bank would be responsible for the collection of the
necessary documentation, the preparation and submission of withdrawal appli-
cations, and the maintenance of necessary accounts for the loan funds.



- 23 -
85.       All imports would be procured from Bank member countries and
Switzerland. Aside from health supplies, all procurement would be through
normal commercial channels except in the case of contracts costing over US$5
million which would be procured in accordance with international competitive
bidding. Vaccines, drugs and DDT would be procured through PAHO, which would
act as agent for the Borrower for this purpose because it buys in large
quantity and can purchase at the lowest possible prices. It is expected that
the entire loan would be disbursed by March 31, 1980.
Counterpart Funds
86.       The Peruvian Soles equivalents generated by the sale of program
loan funds in the amount of about US$11.4 million (the loan funds allocated for
technical assistance and for health imports will not generate counterpart
funds) would be credited to a special account in the Central Bank and used to
finance high priority development projects in the 1979 and 1980 PSIP (Section
3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). Projects in agriculture, mining and
infrastructure will be given priority. Alternatively, and if warranted by
demand, the Government may use up to US$15 million to establish a dollar
denominated revolving fund to finance imports used in the production of
non-traditional exports. This fund would be set up under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank (Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
PART V - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PERU
87.       The Bank has made 34 loans in Peru for a total amount of US$561.1
million, net of cancellations. About 40 percent of the Bank lending to Peru
has been for transportation (mainly highways and ports), 19 percent for
agriculture, 19 percent for electric power, 14 percent for mining and industry,
and about 8 percent for education and urban development.
88.       Of the US$238.9 million undisbursed as of February 28, 1979 about
90 percent is attributable to six loans made in 1976 and 1977. The slow
start-up of these loans (only two of which were "repeater" operations), as
well as the slow progress of previous operations has been due, in large part,
to the government's weak project execution capacity and a shortage of counter-
part funds that worsened as the economic situation deteriorated during this
period. As a result, disbursements have averaged only about $25 million per
year over the past few years (Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans as of February 28, 1978, and notes on the execution of on-going projects).
In an effort to improve this situation, the Government and the Bank have
agreed on a program to accelerate project execution. The principal measures
are:
(i) to provide in the 1979 budget an adequate level of counterpart
funds for Bank projects;
(ii) to restructure the Education and the Lima/Amazon Corridor Projects
(see Annex II for further details); and



- 24 -
(iii) to set up a mechanism to monitor project execution, including
execution of the program loan. This would consist of assigning
senior officials from the Ministry of Economy and the National
Planning Institute to review progress on the projects and report
to the Economic Council of the Cabinet each month. These officials
would provide liason between the Bank and Government and assist
in closely monitoring progress over the next year.
89.       With these actions and since start-up problems facing some of the
newer projects have now been largely overcome, the pace of disbursement is
expected to increase over the next year.
90.       The main objectives of Bank lending to Peru have been to assist
in (a) the creation of a physical and social infrastructure capable of
sustaining and fostering development; (b) the expansion of productive capacity
in crucial sectors; (c) the consolidation of structural and institutional
changes, particularly land and education reforms; and (d) the strengthening
of agencies to implement and operate projects effectively. In the past,
Bank lending has concentrated on infrastructure in the transportation and
power sectors. More recently, in the face of mounting economic difficulties,
the Bank's emphasis has shifted to more directly productive fields -- mining,
agriculture and industry -- to aid Peru in surmounting its balance of payments
problems. The proposed loan, and a possible second program loan, if the
economic situation warrants it, will directly assist the recovery process.
91.       Project preparation has continued so as to maintain a pipeline which
can be reactivated when economic conditions permit a resumption of normal project
lending. Future lending would support projects that would increase production
and exports. The next operation that would be ready for Bank consideration is
an irrigation rehabilitation project which would benefit agrarian reform coop-
eratives and small farmers growing cotton for export and food crops in the
Lower Piura Valley. Apart from this project, those being considered for Bank
financing in the near future would require minimal local financing. They
include a small rural development project to increase agricultural and live-
stock production of agrarian reform settlements in the Sierra and a small
project to increase production at PETROPERU's Talara and jungle oil fields.
Preparation works have also begun on a sixth agricultural credit project and
on a mining operation.
92.       Bank support for infrastructure improvement and development will
also continue in view of the serious problems that have arisen as a result of
past underinvestment. The Water Supply and Power Engineering Loan approved in
October 1978 will finance studies for future water supply and hydroelectric
projects for the Lima area, and a highway maintenance operation is planned.
Finally, Bank lending would be designed to help Peru deal with its difficult
social problems. In addition to the agricultural projects mentioned above, a
follow-up urban development project is contemplated.

93.       Bank loans to Peru constituted about 7 percent of total outstanding
debt, including undisbursed, at the end of 1978, and absorbed about 2.8 percent
of the country's external debt service in 1978. Assuming increased recourse
to long-term bilateral and multilateral aid by Peru, the Bank's share in the
country's outstanding public foreign debt by 1985 could reach 12 percent and
its share of debt-service would be around 5.3 percent.
94.       IFC commitments to date have been US$26.5 million (US$15 million
to the Southern Peru Copper Corporation for the Cuajone Copper Mining Project)
of which US$14.8 million is held by the Corporation. A summary statement
of IFC investments as of February 28, 1979 is presented in Annex II.
95.       The other principal aid agencies lending to Peru -- IDB and AID --
are expected to continue giving special attention to agriculture with IDB
emphasizing agricultural credit and AID stressing rural development. Total
loan commitments as of June 30, 1978 by the principal agencies are summarized
in the following table:

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 949-PE:   Education Project; US$24.0 million Loan of December 5, 1973;
Effective Date: March 5, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project has experienced serious difficulties and is now about
40 months behind schedule. In the first 3-1/2 years after effectiveness,
there was little progress owing to delays in establishing and staffing the
project unit, weaknesses in the unit itself and a long delay in adopting the
educational reform which was to determine curricula. This last difficulty was
resolved with the reform's implementation in 1977, but project execution is
still being hampered by weaknesses in the project unit and cumbersome bureau-
cratic procedures. In order to resolve these problems, the project is being
modified to reduce its scope, increase the Bank disbursement percentage and
improve administrative procedures to speed execution (see President's memorandum
R79-59 of March 27, 1979). The Closing Date would be extended to June 30, 1981.
Loan 1025-PE: Sixth Highway Project; US$25.0 million Loan of July 1, 1974;
Effective Date: August 21, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Loan 1025-PE finances improvement of the Lima-Pucallpa highway which
connrects the Amazon basn to thie Pacific 'oast * In view of the unusually
difficult terrain and limited government implementation capacity, the project
was divided into two stages which are financed by separate loans, 1025-PE and
1196-PE (see below). Because of initial delays and substantial cost increases,
the scope of the project was reduced in February 1978 (see President's memo-
randum R78-36), and the Closing Date postponed to June 30, 1980. Construction
is now well advanced and should be completed this year.
Loan 1196-PE: Lima-Amazon Transport Corridor Project; US$76.5 million Loan of
May 27, 1976; Effective Date: August 18, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
The project's river ports component has progressed slowly because
of technical problems which delayed completion of design, but it is now about
to get underway, although with some cost increases. There have been serious
delays in contracting for civil works under the road component because of
slow procedures and limited government implementation capacity. The Government
has proposed to restructure the project so as to increase the financing for
urgently needed road maintenance and eliminate improvement of those road
sections which cannot be completed within a reasonable time. A proposed
modification of the project will be presented to the Executive Directors,
on a "non objection" basis, shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 5
Loan 1215-PE:  Fifth Power Project; US$36.0 million Loan of September 20, 1976;
Effective Date: November 18, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The slowdown of demand in ELECTROLIMA's market in the wake of the
current economic difficulties as well as procurement problems have delayed
somewhat the project's power distribution component and completion is expected
about a year behind schedule. Despite tariff adjustments during 1978 and in
January and March 1979, inflation and increases in the cost of purchased
energy are likely to prevent ELECTROLIMA from meeting its covenanted contribu-
tion to expansion this year unless further action is taken. This is now
under discussion with the Government. Serious delays were also experienced in
getting the technical assistance program of the loan underway; however, some
consultants have now been retained, and with strong support promised by newly
appointed officials it is expected that the program will begin to progress
normally in the near future.
Loan 1283-PE: Urban Sites and Services Development Project; US$21.6 million
Loan of October 12, 1976; Effective Date: January 10, 1977;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980.
Administrative difficulties, particularly the need to reconcile
Peruvian procedures with Bank Guidelines for Procurement, have delayed the
project by about one year. Project execution has now begun and its pace
is expected to pick up this year, as most design work has been completed.
Loan 1281-PE:  CENTROMIN Mining Project; US$40.0 million Loan of December 6,
1976; Effective Date: May 24, 1977; Closing Date: December 31,
1980.
Initiation of the copper mining component which the IDB is co-
financing with the Bank and which amounts to about 90 percent of total project
cost, has been delayed by about one year because of the lack of local counter-
part funds. The Government has now decided to proceed with the project with
support from a supplementary IDB loan which will help cover part of the finan-
cing shortfall. Engineering and procurement activities on this part of the
project should be initiated shortly. Construction of the mine-water treatment
plant has also experienced some delays but is now advancing satisfactorily.
Loan 1358-PE: Industrial Credit Project; US$35.0 million Loan of January 28,
1977; Effective Date: March 30, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Since Peru's economic recession has led to a contraction of investment
and to lower than anticipated demand for the loan, disbursements are lagging
behind schedule. In view of this, the Borrower--the National Development Bank
(COFIDE)--has agreed to finance projects identified by commercial banks and
other financial institutions, which would also guarantee these loans and
provide some loan servicing. The initial response has been encouraging and
the credit line is now being committed more rapidly.

Lima, March 21, 1979
Mr. Robert S. Mc Namara
President
Inteiriational Bank f.or
Reconstruction and Development
Washington D.C.
Dear Mr. Mc Namara
1.   Peru has suffered, over the last few years, the effects of a severe
economic crisis which has caused social and political difficulties
2.   As a consequence of this crisis, the present level of production of
goods and services is barely similar to that attained in 1975; real
income of wage earners i5 lower than 1970 levels; the rates of -
open unemployment as well as underemployment, are higher  than
in previous years; and the rate of inflation in 1978 was the highest
ever registered in Peruvion statistics.
3.   Further, in the external sector, the country foced an acute  lack
of foreign exchange and "as unable to meet the domestic dlemand
for imported goods, mainl) inputs for industry and other productive
- sectors.
These problems reached a crisis peak during the first half of 1978,
when the probability of stopping repayment of international debt was
faced, together with loss of Government's control over public finance
deficit, the exchange rate, and the inflation rate.
4.   To cope with this situation, Peruvian economic authorities formulated
and began to implement an int grmted economic prograrn desicnzd  to
control cnd over-come the crisis. Th,s Prcara,Im, \hich has Gliceady
been publ ished, applies to the period: June 1978- December 1980
(Public investment is programmed through 19S2). During the preparation

of the Program views were exchanged with and suggestions were
received from members of several World Bank technical missions,for
whose assistance and comments I should like to express my appreciation.
5.   The main objective of the Program is to restore basic equilibrium to the
economy, permitting a selective reactivation of economic activity which,
together with an improvement in the efficiency of the public and
private productive sectors, should lay the basis for an adequate solution
of the acute employment and wealth distribution problems.
6.   The global Program is made up of four elements, as follows
a)   Economic and Financial Stabilization Program;
b)   Refinancing of External Public Debt Program;
c)   Selective Reactivation of the Economy Program; and
d)   Public Investment Program.
A.   Economic and Financial Stabilization Program
7.   This Program, which served as a basis for negotiations with the
International Monetary Fund, is reflected in the current Stand- By
Arrangement. Its two fundamental objectives are to revert the  negctive
trend of the Balance of Payments and to reduce the rate of inflation.Up
to now, all objectives have been met, through the implementation of a
series of measures which include: the reestructuring of the 1978 Central
Government budget; the increase of some taxes; the reestablishment of
continous adjustment of the exchange rote; the periodical increases of
interest rates; the reformulation of the Monetary Progryam and of the Legal
Cash Reserve Requirements System, and the periodical adjustments of
prices of the procLcts subjct to control. The Government of Peru has
the intention of contin,zingj to comnlIy %vitn the Stancd  By Arrangj--llent.

B.   Refinancing of External Public Deot
8.   Projections of exports and of externcl public debt service before refinancing
showed debt service to exports ratios of 56.3 per cent for 1978; 57.7 per
cent for 1979; and of 48.4 per cent for 1980. This shows that the percentage
of exports needed for payment of external public debt service was far too
high and it would not have permitted an imports level adequate to sustain
economic activity. Because of this, four external public debt refinancing
arrangements were made for the amounts that would have been paid over
19a78, 1979 and 1980. These arrangements were arrived at  (i) with the
$oviet Union; (ii) with private international banks; (iii) with the countries
that participate in the Club of Paris; and (iv) with some Latin American
and Eastern European Socialist countries.
9.   Total debt relief is of approximately US$ 1,800 million, of which the
greater part shall be paid over a 4 to 5 year period, with three years
of grace.
10.  These refinancing operations have reduced considerably the percentage
of foreign exchange earnings necessary for foreign public debt service,
to levels of 34 per cent for 1979 and of 25 per cent for 1980.
C.   Selective Reactivation of the Economy Program
11.  Keeping in mind the resource constraints, the Economic Program for
1978- 1980 includes measures leading to the reactivation of the economy,
giving priority to agriculture, export industries, energy, and mining.
Policies and specific action to be implemented have been divulged by
the Government and also transniitted to thie 'Icrld E,cnk.

been jointly ancalyzed with members of W/orld Bank technical missions.
13.  The Program's main objective is to start aoain the economic growth
process, based upon the priority sectors mentioned (paragraph eleven)
and directly related to the cornparative advantages the Peruvian
economy has for international trade, mainly based on its natural and
human resources and on an improved efficiency of its production capacity.To
achieve this, among other measures, the protection of industry shall be
reduced, exports diversification shall be stimulated, administrative
controls over economic activities shall be reduced, the price system
shall be made more flexible, and economic analysis of Government
investments shall be strengthened.
a.   Reduction of protection of industry
14.  This reform  includes the following specific measures : (i) gradual elimination
of the National Register of Manufactures , which played the role of an
imports restriction tool. Early this year such protection has been eliminated
for a total of approximately 50 per cent of the products included in th'ie
Register, and half- yearly reduction-s of the Interim List of Imports
Prohibitions shall be made for the other 50 per cent, towards its total
elimination in late 1980; (ii) gradual elimination of customs duties
exonerations. This process should also be ended by late 1980, at the
latest; (iii) formuiction of a new customs tariffs system, substantially
reducing the levels of tariff protectioni wvith a view to the improvement
of efficiency in the industrial sector. This reduction shall be made from
time to time, and should be totally accomplishied in 1983, The new
tariff should result in  f[czi-i' .;rc   e fl n .Ad e  cc.d,n. a maximum of

b.   Exports Promotion
15.  A low for the Promotion of Non Traditional Exports has recently been
passed. Among other things, it guarantees the maintenance, in the
future, of tax incentives, and eliminates bureaucratic controls and legal
obstacles for these exports.
c.   Tax policies
16.  A special effort is being made to update tax rates, eliminate marginal
taxes with high collection costs, and to broaden the tax bcase. To this
end, exceptions and exonerations will continue to be reduced,independent
professionals incomes shall be fully analyzed for tax purposes, and
external wealth indicators shall be considered in ascertaining taxable
income. A Program for the improvement of tax administration has been
undertaken, and, to achieve this, the necessary resources shall be made
available to the Direccion General de Contribuciones. To meet all these
objectives we have requested financing, through the Program Loan, of
technical assistance from the World Bank.
d.   Exchange Rate Policy
17.  The Exchange Rate shall be constantly readjusted, by means of mini -
devaluations, so that approximate real relative parity is mainitained.
e.   Interest Rates Policy
18.  Adjustments of the interest rate are foreseen, insofar as periodic
assessments should show that they are necessary in order to achieve, in
1979, and maintain in the fjture, effective positive interest rates in
real termns.
f.   Monetary Policy
19.  Monetary and Credit expansion will be related to stabilizatiol objectives.
However, selective assignment of available credit will favor poroductive
sectors according to prioritie.; set forth in the Economic Program.

9.   Prices and Incomes Policies
20.  For those goods whose prices are subject to control, equilibrium  prices
that reflect production costs are planned; this will be achieved through
gradual and periodic adjustments. Furthermore, for these and other
goods, administrctive requirements will be made more flexible. Wages
and salaries shall be also readjusted, taking into account inflation
rates and the need to protect the purchasing power of low-income
population.
D.   Public Investment Program
21.  The Public Investment Program., over the 1978-1982 period, constitutes
a serious effort aiming mainly at the increase of public investment
and its concentration on projec;ts with higher economic returns. Over
the past few years a slowdown in execution of some projects has
become apparent, parallel to a general reduction in capital expenditures,
which has taken place as a resuilt of budgetary cuts reflected in limited
available funds. These factors have been affecting many projectt which
benefitted from external financing but where internal counterpart funds
were insufficient.
22.  The Government will in future Give priority to ongoing projects wvhich
contribute to economic recovery. To this end, Peru has taken acvion to
facilitate a faster execution of projects. Those that are externally
Financed-including World Bank Icons-shall benefit from such action
23.  Important technical help has been received from the World Bank in
determination of economic criterici for the selection of projects included
in the Public Investment Program. We expect to continue beneFitting
from the help of tl-he Bank's professional staff in this field.
24.  It must be noted that the investment l^vels sei for,h in thie Government
Budget and in the Public Investment Program for 1979 are specifically
and portly based upon financing we expect to obtain through the Program

Loan. This financing is alo included in the terms of the current
Stand-By Arrongement with the International Monetary Fund, and irt
the Agreement signed with private commercial bankers to refinance
1979 debt service.
25.  The attached schedule includes the essentials of the Economic Program
and the specific measures actually undertaken or considered.
CONCLUSION
26. The above outlines the existence of a consistent Global Economnic Program,
with clear priorities, upon which 'the Peruvian Government bawes all
actions aiming at the stabilization of our economy and the recovery of
its levels of economic acti ity and, in the final account, of the standaord
of living of its population. This Program has been scrupulously adhered
to up to now. Within this context the Program Loan has an important
role to play for two reasons: a) It rnakes foreign exchange resources
available to the productive sectors of the economy, necessary For the
import of basic inputs for ndustry and for other productive sectors.Considering
present under-utilization of installed capacity, this should result in a direct
and positive effect upon the rate of growth of Gross Domestic Pioduct; and,
b) its proceeds converted into soles shall be used to finance, :ounterpart
funds for high priority investment projects, and will provide increased
resources to export financing.
27.  Taking into consideration all facts set forth above, I should like to
reiterate the Peruvian Government's interest in the prompt approval of a
Program Loan for US$ 115 million.
Yours sincerely,

1/  Column I summarizes the results of a study by the Ministry of Industry and nommerce
based on a sample of 490 firms, which defined capacity utilization as the ratio of
total number of working hours of the firm's main machinery during the year to the
maximum number of hours it could have worked (weightedby each firm's volume of
production). The ranking in column II presents the results of a study by Peru's
Industrial Bank based on a sample of 265 client firms which defines maximum
capacity as 75% of the "technical" theoretical capacity of the equipment.  Both
studies attempt to measure "structural" or theoretical capacity utilization and
refer to 1976. Column III, based on the volume of physical production in 1977
expressed as a percentage of the peak volume of physical production during 1973-77,
uses industrial census data and attempts to measure the increase in excess capacity
as a result of the economic crisis. The figures in brackets are percentages of
capacity utillization.
