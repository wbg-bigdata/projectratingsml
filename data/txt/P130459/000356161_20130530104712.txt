Main Policy Areas       Public finance, pensions, health and social assistance
Program Development     This is the second in a series of two development policy loans supporting the
Objective(s)            government of Poland’s goal of strengthening public finances. The DPL program is
                        central to the Bank’s engagement in the country in the area of public finance reform, as
                        described in the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) presented to
                        the Board on June 7, 2011. The CPSPR highlights that the DPL program is expected to
                        support Poland’s fiscal consolidation agenda, while strengthening fiscal institutions and
                        improving the efficiency and sustainability of social spending.
                        The programmatic DPL is structured around three pillars with the following
                        development objectives: (i) consolidating public finances to ensure a steady decline of
                        the fiscal deficit to stabilize and over the medium term reduce public debt; (ii)
                        strengthening fiscal institutions to ingrain a prudent fiscal stance (including at the sub-
                        national level) over the medium term; and (iii) advancing long-term fiscal reforms to
                        secure the sustainability of social spending in view of Poland’s demographic challenge.
                        These policies aim to enhance Poland’s economic resilience in the face of adverse times
                        and to protect fiscal space for key growth-enhancing investments.
Results Indicators      1. By the end of 2013, the public debt-to-GDP ratio (national definition) is stabilized
                             at or below the 2011 level
                        2. By the end of 2013, the local governments’ debt-to-GDP ratio (ESA’95 definition)
                             is stabilized at or below the 2011 level
                        3. By the end of 2013, the social security funds’ deficit-to-GDP ratio (ESA’95
                             definition) is reduced compared to 2010
                        4. Hospital arrears are reduced by 8 percent by end-2013 compared to end-2011
                        5. The last-resort minimum income benefit for a “typical? poor family is increased in
                             2013 compared to 2011

                        IBRD PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A PROPOSED

               SECOND PUBLIC FINANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

                                    TO THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND


                      I.       INTRODUCTION AND COUNTRY CONTEXT
1.      This proposed second development policy loan (DPL2), in a programmatic series of
two development policy loans, supports the government of Poland in strengthening its
public finances. After the deterioration in the fiscal accounts induced by the global financial crisis
and continued external pressures, 1 the Polish authorities view strengthening public finances critical
to maintain economic resilience, preserve favorable access to financial markets, protect fiscal space
for strategic growth-enabling investments, and secure fiscal sustainability. The DPL series is central
to the Bank’s engagement in Poland as described in the Country Partnership Strategy Progress
Report (CPSPR) presented to the Board on June 7, 2011. The proposed amount for the second loan
(DPL2) is EUR 1 billion.

2.     Sound macroeconomic policies coupled with limited external imbalances have
helped Poland maintain economic growth despite the slowdown and economic uncertainty
in Europe since 2008. Poland is the only European Union (EU) country that has grown
continuously over the last five years. Moreover, its economy has expanded faster than any other
economy in the EU since 2007 (Figure 1). As a result, Poland has reduced the per capita-income gap
with EU15 countries by almost 10 percentage points to 58 percent over the last four years. 2

3.      Notwithstanding these positive developments over the past few years, Poland is not
immune to the protracted recession in the Euro area. Due to the prevailing uncertainty in the
Euro area, subdued global demand and weakening domestic demand, growth slowed to 2 percent in
2012 and is expected to slow even further in 2013. Poland is closely tied through production, trade
and finance with the Euro area, facilitating the spread of both adverse and positive developments
from the west to the east of the EU. Since the global crisis in 2008, policies have been geared
towards rebuilding the policy space to counter adverse shocks. The Government has taken steps to
strengthen medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability. Since the economic slowdown in the second
half of 2012, the Government has been putting more emphasis on policies aimed at boosting
Poland’s economic growth, while preserving sustainable fiscal stance through supporting
investment, further deregulation in the product and labor markets, and support to families. This
DPL directly supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen public finance in a growth-friendly
manner.

4.     Poverty has remained low. Poverty has been on a declining trend since 2004 (Figure 2). 3
Poverty continued its descent in each year after 2008, albeit at a slower pace than in the period 2004-
1 The fiscal deficit widened from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010 and public debt level

increased from 45 percent of GDP to 54.8 percent of GDP over the same period.
2 The group of EU15 countries comprises: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,

Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
3 The social assistance threshold is used in Poland as one of several poverty thresholds. However, because thresholds are

infrequently adjusted, their real value changes over time. Alternative poverty measurements are therefore more
informative. The ECAPOV US$5 per day poverty line is set in constant 2005 USD adjusted for Purchasing Power

                                                           1
    2008. The poverty profile remains broadly unchanged. The incidence of poverty is high among the
    unemployed, families with household heads with low education, families with many children, and
    households in small towns and rural areas. The Gini coefficient suggests that inequality has remained
    essentially unchanged over the last seven years.

       5.      Prime Minister Tusk began a second term in office in November 2011, with the next
       general election scheduled for late 2015. The new coalition government has a small majority in
       Parliament, but faces a divided opposition. The Government was elected with a strong mandate for
       reform, particularly in the areas of public finance, financial sector stability and the business
       environment. This second term in office opened a window of opportunity to launch necessary,
       albeit politically difficult, reforms.
                            II.       MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK
    2.1. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
    6.      Poland’s economy has performed well during and after the 2008 global financial
    crisis. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, including limited macroeconomic imbalances at the
    onset of the crisis, large and diversified domestic economy, close trade and supply chain linkages to
    Germany and adequate policy mix prior to and during the crisis, helped the economy withstand
    external shocks. Accommodative monetary policy and automatic fiscal stabilizers supported
    economic growth, while solid banking regulation and supervision strengthened the resilience of the

    around 4 percent on the back of strong consumption and improved labor market conditions.

    Parity. The Eurostat poverty or social exclusion concept uses a composite indicator that measures the proportion of the
    population living in households that have one or more of the following deprivations: (1) equivalized disposable
    household income after social transfers that is less than 60 percent of national median income, (2) severe material
    deprivation, measured as being unable to afford at least four of nine basic goods or services, or (3) low work intensity,

7.       Economic activity started to weaken considerably in 2012. Overall, the economy grew
by 1.9 percent in 2012, but the macroeconomic picture changed substantially throughout the year.
While in the first quarter the economy expanded by 3.5 percent, it slowed to 0.7 percent in the
fourth quarter on the back of weakening domestic demand. Lower consumer and business
confidence, a slack labor market, and declines in real wages, hampered consumption growth.
Investment activity subsided due to the end of the investment cycle related to the EU financial
perspective 2007-13, the completion of investments for the European Soccer Championships and
the ongoing fiscal consolidation. Despite lower demand among Poland’s trading partners, net
exports supported growth. High frequency short-term indicators for industrial production and
construction point to a continued weakness of the economy, which is likely to bottom out in the
first quarter of 2013.

8.      The labor market proved resilient in the times of the global crisis, but deteriorated in
2012 and early 2013. Unemployment rates according to the Labor Force Survey (LFS) stayed at
around 9.5 percent during 2010-11, that is a 2 percentage-points increase from the pre-crisis level.
Over 2012, the harmonized unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) increased to around 10.4
percent in December 2012 and continued to rise to 10.6 percent in January and February 2013. As a
result of slowing output growth and uncertain growth prospects, the crisis-induced labor hoarding
came to an end as employers started to reduce employment rather than working hours. In addition,
weaker performance of construction and labor-intensive manufacturing led to significant layoffs in
these sectors.

9.       While external imbalances have narrowed, vulnerabilities remain. The current account
deficit narrowed from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to 3.5 percent in 2012. The biggest improvement
came from the trade balance, as exports grew faster than imports. The effect was partially countered
by the deterioration in the income account, reflecting increased transfers to foreign holders of
sovereign debt. The share of portfolio inflows into the bond market increased substantially as
foreign investors (mainly real money investors with long investment horizons) purchased
government bonds, which in early 2013 reached record low yields (10 year bonds below 4.5 percent).
At the same time, the process of orderly financial sector deleveraging continued with funding
withdrawal by foreign banks. Nearly 90 percent of the current account deficit was financed by net
foreign direct investment (FDI) (around 0.9 percent of GDP) and EU capital transfers (around 2.2
percent of GDP in 2012). External debt, which was around 55 percent of GDP in the pre-crisis
period, increased to around 70 percent of GDP by end-2012, reflecting the increase in government
indebtedness. The share of short-term debt in total external debt dropped to 19.2 percent in
December 2012 from around 25 percent in 2007-10. The level of international reserves remained
broadly adequate, covering 5.6 months of imports of goods and services (as of February 2013).

10.      Monetary policy helped the adjustment during 2008-09, anchored inflation
expectations during the rebound 2010-12, and become accommodative towards the end of
2012. During the global financial crisis, the flexible exchange rate facilitated the economy’s
adjustment to external shocks. Monetary policy was accommodative with cuts in policy rates and
liquidity provision. Inflation pressures increased in 2011, mostly driven by higher food and energy
prices, a value added tax (VAT) hike, robust domestic demand, and PLN depreciation. In response,
the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) hiked policy rates by a cumulative 1 percentage point in the first
half of 2011 and another 25 basis points in May 2012. Headline inflation declined subsequently to
3.4 percent in October 2012 from its peak of 5 percent in May 2011. In response to slowing output
growth and muted wage pressures, the MPC started an easing cycle. Between November 2012 and
March 2013, the policy rate was cut by 150 basis points to 3.25 percent. While the overall inflation

                                                 3
rate in 2012 was at 3.7 percent, a level above the National Bank of Poland (NBP) tolerance band of
1.5-3.5 percent, inflation rate in March 2013 was already below the lower limit of NBP’s tolerance
band (1 percent). According to the IMF’s assessment, Poland’s real effective exchange rate is broadly
consistent with fundamentals. 4

11.      The financial sector has proven resilient. The banking sector has not required public
support and remains well capitalized, liquid and profitable. The capital adequacy ratio remained
strong (at 14.7 percent in December 2012, 90 percent of which is Core Tier 1 capital), and liquidity
was high. According to preliminary data, the profit of the banking sector stood at over PLN 16
billion in 2012, which is almost 4 percent higher than in the record-breaking year of 2011. The
deleveraging of the Euro area banks has been orderly: the fall in foreign funding was offset by rising
domestic deposits. Private sector credit growth slowed to less than 1 percent at the end of 2012
(from above 13 percent a year ago) on account of deteriorating business and consumer confidence.

12.     Yet, the financial sector has vulnerabilities. While these are not vulnerabilities of
systemic nature, they stem from: (i) a large overhang of FX-denominated mortgages, 55 percent of
total residential mortgages at end-2012; (ii) a still high level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) at
around 8.8 percent of the loan portfolio in 2012, concentrated on consumer credit and corporate
loans; and (iii) possible pressures on bank funding and volatility of capital flows. Yet, stress tests
suggest that even under severe scenarios, the share of assets at risk is small, liquidity sufficient and
contagion risks limited.

13.      The Government has pursued counter-cyclical fiscal policies that cushioned the
slowdown in 2008-09 and supported the recovery in 2010. The general government deficit
increased from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2010. The increase in fiscal
imbalances resulted in a rise of public debt from 47.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 54.8 percent of
GDP in 2010. The rise was contained by strong public debt and liquidity management, 5 stable
interest rates on Polish debt, and stepped up privatization.

14.     With the growth rebound in 2011, the Government initiated a process of fiscal
consolidation, which has helped to put public debt on a declining path (Table 1). The general
government headline deficit declined to 5 percent of GDP in 2011 and further to 3.9 percent in
2012. The structural consolidation was even more significant–the structural deficit dropped from
5.1 percent of GDP to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2012. The fiscal effort was a result of a combination
of revenue and expenditure measures:
•       The main measures on the revenue side were: (i) a change in the pension system that shifted
5 percentage points of the contribution from the funded second pillar to the first pillar (sub-account
managed by the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS)); (ii) a one percentage-point increase in the VAT
statutory rate; (iii) a 2 percentage-points increase in the statutory rate on disability contributions paid
by employers; (iv) a new tax on copper and silver; (v) revenues from CO2 emission rights auctions;
(vi) no adjustments to personal income tax (PIT) thresholds; and (vii) increases in various excise
taxes.

5 The 2010 amendment of the Law on Public Finance introduced consolidation of cash management by compulsory or
voluntary depositing temporary free cash resources of public sector entities to MoF accounts. This aimed at more
efficient cash liquidity management to limit public debt.

•       The growth in government spending was contained by: (i) a temporary fiscal rule 6 limiting
increases in all newly enacted and existing discretionary expenditure items to 1 percentage point over
the rate of inflation (CPI); and (ii) a nominal freeze of the budgetary sphere wage bill 7, and (iii)
phasing out of early retirement schemes.
2.2. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
15.      Given the challenging external environment, economic growth in Poland is likely to
remain weak in 2013. With continued recession in the Euro area and slower pace of growth in
Germany and other major trade partners, Poland’s GDP growth rate is expected to be around 1.3
percent in 2013. With growth in exports outpacing that of imports and a relatively weak PLN, net
exports are expected to have a positive contribution to growth. Domestic demand will remain
subdued. Investment growth is projected to be negative in 2013, as business confidence continues to
be weak and firms postpone investment decisions. Lower availability of EU funds at the end of the
2007-13 programming period and the ongoing fiscal consolidation will result in a further decline in
public investment. The recently announced Polish Investment Program 8 is still being designed and is
unlikely to support investment activity in 2013. The deceleration of investment activity will translate
into weak performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Public consumption will
continue to be restrained by the ongoing fiscal consolidation, while private consumption is expected
to be affected by negative labor market developments. In the second half of 2013, private
consumption should start to recover gradually on the back of rising real wages supported by lower
inflation, pension indexation and easing credit conditions. 9

16.      Over the medium-term growth is expected to strengthen to around 3.5 percent. The
external demand is expected to recover. At the moment, the EU economy is likely to bottom out in
the first half of 2013 and return to growth in 2014, as confidence gradually rebounds. 10 The Polish
economy will benefit from the improved external environment. Growth is projected to strengthen to
around 2.4 percent in 2014 and further to 3.5 percent by the end of forecasting period. In addition
to external factors, Poland’s growth would pick up on the back of domestic factors: higher
investment activity related to the receipt of EU structural funds 11 and the kick-off of the Polish
Investment Program. Private consumption will remain subdued. The unemployment rate is expected
to decline in 2015, once growth strengthens (Table 1).

17.     Monetary policy is projected to remain accommodative. The inflation rate is forecasted
to stay close to the lower limit of the NBP’s tolerance band through the forecasting period. Lack of

automatically enforced when Poland is under the EDP.
7 The 475,000 employees of the state budgetary sphere are public sector employees directly under the control of the

central government.
8 The Polish Investment Program–announced by the Prime Minister in October 2012–is aimed at providing financial

resources for investment into energy, infrastructure, and R&D in Poland. Part of the privatization proceeds will be used
to boost the capital base of the state development bank (BGK) and a special investment vehicle (Polskie Inwestycje
Rozwojowe) to leverage private sector resources for investment. The total value of the Program for 2013-2018 is
expected to be around PLN 40 billion (US$13 billion).
9 The recent decision of the Financial Supervisor to relax credit underwriting standards (Recommendation T) and a

Government’s guarantee scheme for SMEs are factors contributing to the easing of credit conditions in Poland.
10 Assessment of the external environment is based on EC Winter Economic Forecast, European Commission, March

2013. The EU economy is expected to grow 0.1 percent in 2013 and 1.6 percent in 2014; the Euro area is expected to
remain in recession in 2013 (-0.3 percent) and return to growth in 2014 (1.4 percent).
11 Poland will get EUR 73 billion for 2014-20 for cohesion policy, roughly 2.5 percent of GDP annually.

domestic demand pressures and moderating commodity prices are likely to keep the inflation rate in
check and may lead to further monetary easing in the first half of 2013, although the 50 basis points
cut from March 2013 makes further cuts less likely.

Notes: The main difference between the national and ESA’95 definitions of public debt is that the former excludes debt
of the National Road Fund (included under the ESA’95 definition). (f) refers to forecasts for 2013-2016 on key
macroeconomic variables.


18.    On the external side, the current account deficit is expected to stay close to 3.5
percent of GDP over the medium term. It is projected to be financed mostly by FDI inflows and
EU transfers (Table 2). The external debt will remain close to 70 percent of GDP over the medium
term and its maturity structure is not expected to change significantly from 2012 (Table 3). External

        debt roll-over rates are expected to be around the average of the last four years, i.e. around 110
        percent. The sustainability of the external debt position is generally robust according to standard
        stress scenarios, including an increase in nominal interest rates, lower GDP growth and a higher
        current account deficit (Figure 3). In addition, private sector flows and continued favorable access to
        international capital markets suggest that external financing needs can be met. By the end of
        February 2013, over 50 percent of government’s financing needs for 2013 were covered.

        12 Public debt in Poland is largely domestic. Under the described GDP growth shock scenario, public debt is more
        sensitive to changes in GDP than external debt. Under this scenario, the current account deficit narrows leading to a
        lower external debt in year (t+1), while the general government primary deficit increases (as automatic stabilizers
        increase expenditures, while revenue collection suffers), thus leading to a higher public debt.

strengthening its fiscal balances over the medium term. The fiscal deficit is projected at around
3.5 percent of GDP in 2013. 13 While the deficit reduction path is delayed as compared to the one

social assistance; and health to secure the sustainability of public finances and to protect fiscal space
needed for strategic infrastructure and human capital investments (see Section III).

20.     The public debt–to–GDP ratio is expected to stabilize in 2013. Weaker output growth is
likely to slow the path of public debt reduction. Per the ESA’95 methodology, public debt is
projected to be close to 56 percent of GDP in 2013 and 2014 before it declines to 55 percent in
2016. This would ensure that Poland’s public debt remains below the Maastricht ceiling of 60
percent of GDP (per ESA’95 methodology) and the national debt limit of 55 percent of GDP (per
national methodology). 14 Stress tests suggest that the debt path is sensitive to a growth shock, 15
which might put the level of public debt above the EU threshold of 60 percent of GDP (Figure 4).

13 Given the external uncertainties, a budget revision might be required in the second half of 2013 to reflect the slowing
pace of economic growth.
14 The Public Finance Act prompts corrective action when the public debt reaches 55 percent of GDP, in addition to the

constitutional ceiling for public debt at 60 percent of GDP. Starting in 2013, the Government is planning to change the
rules for calculating public debt to GDP ratio (national methodology) with respect to the applicability of sanctions. In

21.      The macroeconomic policy framework is considered adequate for the proposed
operation. The macroeconomic policies implemented during and after the global financial crisis
facilitated the needed adjustment, economic resilience and growth. With uncertainty in the external
environment, current macroeconomic policies are geared to mitigate the negative effects of shocks
through prudent fiscal and monetary policies, while keeping external imbalances in check and
maintaining the financial system adequately capitalized. Downside risks to the macroeconomic
outlook include further instability in the Euro area and external debt deleveraging through parent
bank funding of local subsidiaries (see Section VI).
2.3. RELATIONS WITH THE IMF
22.     The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a
successor two-year arrangement for Poland under the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) in the
amount of US$33.8 billion in January 2013. The IMF Executive Board considered that, despite
the slowdown, the Polish economy has shown resilience since the onset of the global economic
crisis thanks to very strong economic fundamentals and policy frameworks, and skillful
macroeconomic management. The FCL arrangements have allowed for a more flexible policy
response to the global crisis while preserving favorable access to international capital markets. The
IMF Board also concluded that Poland continues to meet the qualification criteria for access to FCL
resources. The Polish authorities intend to continue to treat this arrangement as precautionary. An
IMF-World Bank FSAP mission took place in February-March 2013.
                         III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM
 23.      Strengthening public finances and sustaining medium-term economic growth are
 the core priorities of the Government’s reform agenda. Following parliamentary elections in
 2011, Prime Minister Tusk launched a medium-term program aimed at: (i) strengthening public
 finances, (ii) safeguarding financial sector stability, and (iii) supporting private sector growth. At
 that time, fiscal consolidation and medium- and long-term fiscal reforms were priority areas for the
 Government, which was focused on rebuilding fiscal space to enable proper response to adverse
 external shocks. The Government was successful in the implementation of its fiscal consolidation
 strategy in 2011 and 2012 (even despite significantly lower growth rate), which delivered cumulative
 fiscal savings of around 4 percentage points of GDP by end-2012 and put the government debt-to-
 GDP ratio on a declining path. An ambitious reform agenda related to medium- and long-term
 fiscal sustainability issues, particularly in social sectors, was delivered. For example in the area of
 pensions, the Government managed to increase and equalize the retirement age and introduce
 changes to the uniformed services’ pension system. The Government is currently reviewing the
 entitlements to early pensions of other professional groups such as miners, establishing a pay-out
 mechanism from the second pillar and reviewing the functioning of the second pension pillar.
24.      The Prime Minister announced in October 2012 reform measures aiming to boost
economic growth and protect jobs. These measures include a bold off-budget medium-term
investment program, 16 a guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a broadening
of the tax base, regulatory reforms aimed at boosting resilience of the financial sector, an increase in


case public debt to GDP ratio exceeds any of the precautionary thresholds, the ratio will be re-calculated using the
average (instead of end-of period) exchange rate for the calculation of public debt stock. Corrective actions will be
triggered only if the re-calculated ratio is not with compliance with public debt safety thresholds.
15 In this scenario real GDP growth rate is at baseline minus 2 percentage points in each year of the projection period.
16 See footnote 11.

the flexibility of the labor market, and further deregulation of the economy. In addition, the
Government supports families and helps them enter and (re)enter the labor market to address
pressures due to an aging population. 17 New spending measures included in the Government
program are in line with the fiscal consolidation goals and within the public debt safety thresholds.
In calendar year 2013, the Government intends to announce regulations for providing annuities
from the pension funds, which may result in increasing public liabilities.


                                IV.     THE PROPOSED POLICY LOAN
4.1 LINK TO GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND OPERATION DESCRIPTION
 25. The DPL program supports the Government’s priority of strengthening public
 finances. The policy measures are encapsulated in three core areas: (i) consolidating public finances
 in the short term; (ii) strengthening institutions to ensure a prudent fiscal stance over the medium
 term; and (iii) advancing long-term structural fiscal reforms. The objectives of this DPL program
 are to stabilize public debt levels at the national and local government level, and over the medium
 term (beyond the scope of this operation) reduce public debt. The program is also geared towards
 securing the fiscal sustainability of social programs, including in the context of an aging population.
 Lastly, these reforms aim to create the needed fiscal space to support pro-growth policies over the
 medium term.

 26. Adjustments to the scope and the timeframe of Government’s reform agenda led to
 modifications of some indicative DPL2 triggers without compromising the strength and
 integrity of the DPL program (Table 5). The DPL program presented to the IBRD Board of
 Executive Directors in June 2012 outlined eight indicative triggers for the proposed DPL2. Four
 indicative triggers became prior actions of DPL2. One additional prior action was added to reflect
 the authorities’ efforts in strengthening macro-prudential policies. Two indicative triggers were
 reformulated to better reflect the Government’s plans, and two other triggers were dropped due to
 the broadening of the scope of the government’s reform agenda. Namely, the indicative trigger on health
 was dropped as the Ministry of Health (MoH) embedded the creation of a tariff agency into a larger
 sectoral reform program, currently under design. The broader health sector reform envisions
 liquidating the central agency of the health insurance fund (NFZ), decentralizing its powers to
 regional agencies, and creating a new central agency responsible for costing, health technology
 assessment, quality assurance, development of health information systems, and oversight of public
 and private health insurers. The trigger focusing on income accounting for farmers was dropped as the
 Government decided to bundle the income accounting with the introduction of income taxation
 for farmers. With this decision the scope of the reform significantly expanded, affecting the time
 frame of its implementation. Despite these modifications, the original outcome indicators of the
 DPL program are on track to be achieved.




17 Poland is among the European countries with the worst demographic outlook, where the working age population is

projected to shrink by around 10 million people by 2060 – from 27 million in 2010 to around 17 million in 2060.

      4.2. PRIOR ACTIONS AND RESULTS
      4.2.1. CONSOLIDATING PUBLIC FINANCES
      27.     Ensuring a further decline in the structural deficit to stabilize and over the medium
      term reduce public debt and maintain Poland’s favorable access to capital markets is a key
      priority of the Polish Government. Building on the progress made in 2011 and 2012, a further
      reduction in the fiscal deficit is crucial to adhere to Poland’s commitment under the EDP, to meet
      the MTO of a structural fiscal deficit of 1 percent of GDP over the medium term, to rebuild fiscal
      policy buffers to counter external shocks, and to protect priority growth-enhancing spending.

      28.     The expected result of the measures supported under this pillar is to stabilize the
      public debt-to-GDP ratio. The fiscally responsible budgets for 2012 and 2013 have directly
      contributed to a decrease in the general government deficit from close to 8 percent of GDP in 2010
      to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2012. The reduction in the fiscal deficit in 2012 has been instrumental for
      putting public debt on a downward path (Table 4).



      18 In 2013, Poland remains subject to the EDP. Hence, the DPL2 prior action formulation relates to the 2013 Budget

      Law’s requirement to remain in line with the EU EDP.



                                                                   11
DPL2 Prior action: Enact a Budget Law for 2013 in line with the requirements of the EU Excessive Deficit
Procedure.

29.      The fiscal measures embedded in the 2013 budget are expected to bring further
reduction in the headline deficit (Table 6). The headline fiscal deficit is estimated to decrease by
0.4 percentage point of GDP to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013, which would allow Poland to exit the
Excessive Deficit Procedure. On the revenue side, the 2013 fiscal consolidation relies on tax and social
insurance contribution measures initiated in the past two years as well as one-off measures
introduced in 2013. The increase in the VAT rate in 2011 and the increase in the statutory rate on
disability contributions paid by employers in 2012 will render fiscal savings also in 2013. The new
measures in the 2013 budget are mainly of a one-off nature and include the sale of CO2 emission
rights, digital dividends, and revenues from the new system of traffic control. On the expenditure side,
the fiscal consolidation in 2013 is based on containment measures. Similar to the revenue side, a
number of measures were introduced in the context of 2011 and 2012 budgets, but their continued
implementation will bring fiscal savings in 2013. These measures include the temporary “CPI +1?
rule that limits the growth rate of discretionary expenditures to one percentage point over the CPI
rate, the nominal freeze of the wage bill in the state budget, and fiscal savings from the abolition of
early retirement schemes (Table 6).

4.2.2. STRENGTHENING FISCAL INSTITUTIONS
30.     Measures related to strengthening fiscal institutions are crucial to ingrain a prudent
fiscal stance over the medium-term. The Government policies under this pillar will help in: (i)
containing the growth of public expenditures through the introduction of a permanent fiscal rule; (ii)
increasing the LGs’ reporting requirements and implementing the guidelines for the Multiannual
Financial Forecast (MFF) to ensure control of the deficit and debt of the LGs; and (iii) enhancing
the macro-prudential framework, which contributes to strengthening the resilience of the economy
against systemic shocks and the need for costly banks recapitalizations.

31.    The expected result of the measures under this DPL pillar is to stabilize LG’s debt-
to-GDP ratio. Stronger fiscal institutions are expected to contribute to this outcome. In 2012, the
LG’s debt-to-GDP ratio has already decreased to 4.2 percent of GDP.

32.     DPL2 Prior action: MoF designs assumptions for the permanent fiscal rule to limit growth of public
expenditure to trend GDP to foster compliance with the EU requirements under the ratified Treaty on Stability,
Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.




                                                     12
33.     The proposed rule is an expenditure rule with a debt limit. The expenditure rule
element would halt aggregate expenditures from growing faster than the trend nominal GDP,
preventing pro-cyclical expenditure hikes. The debt limit element of the rule requires that
expenditure growth be less than the trend GDP growth if public debt is too high relative to specified
benchmarks. 19 When the public debt exceeds these benchmarks, any required reduction in the ratio
is permanent, i.e. the rule is formulated to prevent the government from increasing future
expenditure so as to restore the pre-existing expenditure-to-GDP ratio. Thus, the current design
would introduce a one-way downward bias in the government expenditures-to-GDP ratio. The rule
also contains a safeguard clause in case of severe crisis: the requirement for slower expenditure
growth due to debt exceeding the benchmark levels is suspended only during severe recessions
(defined as forecasted GDP growth at least 2-3 percent below trend).

37.      The expenditure rule directly addresses the reason behind excessive deficits in
Poland—the excessive rate of growth of expenditures. An expenditure rule is more relevant at
this time than a budget balance rule due to the complexities of measuring the structural fiscal
balance. The expenditure rule would allow for the unrestricted operation of automatic stabilizers on
the revenue side in case of a downturn. However, unlike the EU directive approach, the expenditure
ceiling set by the rule is not affected by revenue increases (reductions) due to tax policy changes.

DPL2 Prior action: Enact amendments to the Public Finance Act to strengthen the quality of LGs’ multi-year
financial forecasts and start implementation by introducing a template and periodic reporting requirements.

34.      Keeping a prudent fiscal stance over the medium term requires the Government to
constrain the deficits of both the central and local governments. The MTO requirement for a
structural deficit not exceeding 1 percent of GDP applies to the general government budget balance
(i.e. the aggregated balances of local and central governments). Thus, budgetary performance and
debt of LGs over the medium term is subject to limits, controls, and monitoring by the central
government.

35.     Existing legislation is presently sufficient to effectively control the aggregate LG
deficit. Restrictions imposed by existing fiscal rules (Box 1), in particular the debt-servicing ratio
rule and the “golden rule?, have proven to work effectively. The LG aggregate deficit has declined
from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2011, and further to 0.4 percent of
GDP in 2012, mainly due to current spending reduction. As a result the aggregate LG debt-to-GDP
ratio has also decreased. In these circumstances, the government has abandoned the introduction of
a new explicit mechanism to limit aggregate deficit of LGs. 20

36.    The introduction of a template and periodic reporting requirements of MFF by LGs
will make the general government fiscal projections more realistic and effective for long-
term financial planning. Since 2011, LGs have prepared MFF to enhance their long-term fiscal
planning. However, the limited capacity of LGs, the different reporting standards used by various
LGs, the very long-term horizon of fiscal projections, and the lack of obligations to report fiscal
19 If debt exceeds 40 percent of GDP, expenditure growth is limited to 80 percent of the trend nominal GDP growth. If
debt exceeds 55 percent of GDP (or if the excessive deficit procedure is applied to Poland), a sharper consolidation is
required, with expenditure growth limited to 70 percent of the trend nominal GDP growth.
20 Designing a sub-national fiscal rule is one possible way to explicitly limit the LG aggregate deficit. The key difficulty in

the design of such a rule is to devise a mechanism to allocate deficit rights between LG units which is equitable and does
not have major adverse effects on the efficient execution of debt-financed capital projects.



                                                             13
plans to the MoF have hindered the use of the tool. The recent improvements to the MFF, i.e. the
establishment of a single template, the introduction of regular reporting in electronic format, and the
shortening of a projection period–are geared to make fiscal projections realistic and the MFF tool
useful for public finance management.

                                 Box 1. Sub-national Fiscal Rules in Poland
The Public Finance Act (PFA) lays out the following rules for LGs: (i) the debt of an individual LG unit may not exceed
60 percent of their revenue (excluding debt issued for pre-financing—bridge financing—of projects co-financed from
EU funds); (ii) debt service (which includes debt repayment plus interest paid and guarantees due in a current year) may
not exceed 15 percent of a local government unit's revenue (iii) the golden rule of a balanced current budget which
implies no current (operational) deficit (since 2011). In addition, LGs face restrictions on their budgets if total public
debt (state and local administrations’ debt combined) exceeds the limits of 55 percent and 60 percent of national GDP
set in the Public Finance Act 21.
Starting from 2014, the uniform ceiling on LG debt (60 percent of revenue) will be removed. In its place, LGs’ ability to
incur new debt will depend on the debt-servicing ratio, and will therefore vary between different local government units.
Under the Public Finance Act, debt servicing expenditure/total revenue cannot exceed the last three years’ average
current balance plus revenue from asset sales/total revenue (Pursuant to provisions of PFA, LG unit, which will not
generate operating surplus for the period 2011-2013 will not be allowed to contract debts in 2014).


DPL2 Prior action: MoF sends for inter-ministerial consultations the draft law on bank resolution to strengthen
the stability of its financial system.

37.     The government is pursuing a series of reforms to strengthen the macro-prudential
oversight of the financial system and avoid costly fiscal recapitalizations or bank bail-outs.
Cognizant of the need to strengthen the capacity of the financial system to support the economy, a
bank resolution framework is being set up. The framework designates the Bank Guarantee Fund
(BFG) as the resolution agency, equipped with a complete set of resolution tools. The new tools will
allow starting the resolution procedure before a bank reaches full insolvency, partial transferring of a
bank’s balance sheet to other banks, applying administrative versus judicial powers, and deploying
new debt write-down tools. Under the rules, BFG will not be allowed to provide open bank
assistance/loans to banks unless these constitute part of a formal resolution process using the least
cost criteria. The draft legislation is in line with the new EU Directive and the resolution principles
espoused by the Financial Stability Board.
4.2.3. ADVANCING LONG-TERM FISCAL REFORMS
38.     Strengthening public finances requires long-term structural reforms to secure
sustainability across sectors. Since 2011, the Government has initiated structural measures of
medium- and long-term nature with a focus on current transfers (pensions) and other public services
(such as health care, social assistance). The focus of these reforms has been three-fold: (i) securing
long-term sustainability of public finances by tackling the challenge of aging; (ii) creating fiscal space
for pro-growth expenditures in the medium and long term; and (iii) supporting fiscal consolidation.
The fiscal-structural measures supported by the DPL program are expected to yield fiscal savings
between 0.7 and 1.1 percent of GDP annually (Table 7).

21If the public debt exceeds the second prudential threshold (55 percent debt to GDP) local authorities have to adopt
budgets adopt a budget with a deficit lower than in the previous year by a percentage calculated using a special formula.
After crossing the third prudential threshold (i.e. 60 percent debt to GDP) LG expenditures cannot be higher than their

39.     The expected results of the measures supported under this DPL pillar are to: (i)
reduce the social security funds’ deficit-to-GDP ratio, (ii) reduce hospital arrears, and (iii)
improve the last-resort minimum income benefit for poor families. Positive results towards
achieving the set result indicators under the third DPL pillar are already visible. The social security
funds’ deficit turned into surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2012. While the Law on Therapeutic
Activities has not yet delivered a reduction in hospital arrears, 22 it has contributed to the
restructuring and corporatization of the hospital sector. 23 Because it increases the financial
accountability of hospital owners, the process will ultimately lead to an improvement of the financial
sustainability of the hospital sector and also result in a reduction in hospital arrears. The adjustments
in social benefits have increased the coverage and generosity of the last-resort minimum income
benefit (see Section 5.1). 24

DPL2 Prior action: Enact amendments to the Law on Pensions to increase statutory retirement age and start
implementation.

40.      In 2012, the retirement age was increased in Poland. Retirement ages for both men and
women are being raised from the current 65 for men and 60 for women to 67 for both men and
women at the rate of 3 months per calendar year. As a result, the retirement age will be 67 for men
retiring at the end of 2020 and for women retiring at the end of 2040. In response to concerns about
individuals not being able to work that long, the Government instituted a new partial pension for
men/women at least 65/62 years old, respectively, and with at least 40 years of pension
contributions in the case of men and 35 years in the case of women. This new partial pension will be
based on a half of the entitlement accumulated until that age and not subject to a minimum pension,

22 There are many channels through which the incentives put in place by the 2011 Law on Therapeutic Services can be

expected to improve the financial standing, including the debts and arrears of public hospitals. In the most direct
manner, under the law, hospital founders can or may have to transform some facilities into commercial code companies
or liquidate them. In both instances, they would be obligated to restructure and absorb at least some of the arrears and
debt of the facilities, which would mathematically decrease their stocks. More generally though, as hospital founders
have to cover the facilities deficits at the end of each year, they would be interested in improving the management,
including financial, of hospitals, which would bring about improvements in the medium term.
23 As of March 2013, 26 hospitals have decided to change their legal status. Another 22 hospitals are getting ready to

change their legal form. So far, no hospital closure has been reported.
24 The law that came into effect in October 2012 raised the minimum-income threshold for social assistance from PLN

477 to PLN 542 per month for single-person households, and from PLN 351 per capita per month to PLN 456 per
capita per month for households with more than one person.



                                                          15
with the other half of the entitlement added when the person reaches the age of 67. Focus group
studies conducted in 2012 by the Bank indicated that majority of older workers wanted to continue
working, but the mechanism to allow part-time work while collecting a pension did not exist. The
new partial pension may provide a remedy to that problem.

41.     From an adequacy of benefits point of view, raising the retirement age results in an
almost 50 percent increase in the projected future benefits for women. The increase in benefits
is expected to occur both because individuals will reach retirement with increased years of
contributions and therefore a larger account balance in their pension accounts, and because, under
the notional account scheme that Poland has adopted, the account balance is divided by life
expectancy at the age when a person retires to determine the initial pension benefit. Since life
expectancy at age 67 is lower than at age 60 for women or 65 for men, the benefit level will increase
even if the individual does not continue working until the new retirement age.

DPL2 Prior action: Enact amendments to the pension legislation on uniformed services to increase length of service
and introduce a minimum retirement age.

42.      In 2012, eligibility criteria for uniformed pensions were tightened. Previously
individuals could retire after 15 years of service regardless of age, with some allowed to retire even
earlier. The new law applies only to new entrants to uniformed services, which include police,
firemen, border guards, security at government offices, military, and penitentiary. It stipulates that an
individual must be at least 55 years of age and at least 25 years of service. Benefits will be based on
60 percent of the average salary during a period of 3 consecutive years rather than on the final salary
as previously, reducing the incentive for promoting a higher level just before retirement. While
previously the benefits were equal to 2.6 percent of the final salary per year of service, the new
benefit formula pays a lower rate, 1.6 percent, for the first 25 years and 3 percent per year for service
years above 25. Uniformed personnel who do not meet the 25 year minimum service requirement
will have an amount equivalent to the value of contributions they would have made on their past
salaries transferred to the national system.

43.     While the uniformed service pensions will not be harmonized with the national
pension scheme, they are moving towards similar parameters. The first wave of retirement on
this new system will take place in January 2038. This reform is expected to reduce incentives toward
higher last salaries, but otherwise may be fiscally neutral. The greater objective is to create more
equity and to bring the uniformed services pensions closer to the national system, and hence
decrease the fiscal imbalance of the Social Security Funds.

DPL2 Prior action: Enact amendments to social assistance and family benefits legislations to: (i) increase the
income threshold for the last-resort minimum-income social assistance benefit that tops up the incomes of the poorest;
and (ii) improve targeting of the benefit for caregivers of disabled dependents.

44.     These two social assistance measures improve benefits’ adequacy and targeting in
fiscally prudent way.
•       The social assistance income threshold that determines eligibility for the last-resort minimum-
income benefit and the family benefits, respectively, was raised with resolutions that entered into
force in October and November 2012. The legislation also partially raises the minimum-income
benefit ceiling that caps benefits that apply to some qualifying recipient families, and it increases



                                                         16
   family benefit amounts. The aim of these legislative changes is to make income support payments
   more generous for the poorest benefit recipients, and to improve their coverage.
   •         To improve the targeting of the benefit for caregivers and thus free up resources to better
   support those in need, the government has passed legislation to separate the caregiver/nursing
   allowance from the special care allowance. Parent(s) caring for a disabled child and forgoing their
   job(s) will continue to receive the nursing benefit regardless of income. Special care allowance will
   cover individuals caring for disabled adults. The legislation introduces an income threshold that
   determines benefit entitlements based on income. The objective is to improve the targeting by
   limiting entitlements for families of severely disabled adults with relatively high incomes, and to limit
   eligibility to those caregivers who require compensation for forgone earnings (i.e. excluding those
   who already receive other social benefits such as pensions, social assistance, parental leave
   allowance). The resulting budgetary savings are intended to partly finance the extension of
   minimum-income benefit entitlements.

4.4. LINK TO CPS AND OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
46.     The proposed DPL series is central to the Bank’s engagement in Poland, as
emphasized in the Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report FY09-13 (CPSPR). The
CPSPR—discussed by the Board on June 7, 2011—highlights that fiscal consolidation is among
Poland’s main economic policy challenges, and states that this process needs to be supported by
further improvements to fiscal institutions and structural reforms to help secure the sustainability of
social programs. The outcomes expected under the DPL series are aligned with those envisaged by
the CPS, including fiscal consolidation, strengthened fiscal institutions, and fiscally sustainable
transfers and social spending. While the new CPS is being developed, it is already clear that public
finances will remain one of the strategic areas of the World Bank’s involvement in Poland.
4.5. CONSULTATIONS AND COLLABORATION
47.      All legislative measures and reforms in Poland are subject to a thorough consultation
process with social partners, civil society and groups likely to be impacted. The consultation
process is an important institutional feature of Poland’s process of government. Public consultations
are compulsory by law for all new policy initiatives. According to the regulatory guidelines for this
process, 25 stakeholders need to be involved throughout the policy-making and legislation
preparation. The Government uses various methods to consult the public, including public hearings
and meetings, citizen’s panels, surveys, consultations through electronic means (e.g., government
websites) and media. In addition, the rules on public consultation set the minimum period for inter-
ministerial consultations at 21 days and for external consultations with the public at 30 days. Regular
legislative procedures ensure careful scrutiny during consideration by Parliament, and hearings and
debate in Parliament receive large coverage by the news media. Regular updates to the process are
posted in government websites.

48.      The authorities have carried out an extensive consultation process with a wide range
of stakeholders on each policy reform supported by this operation. An illustrative example
relates to the amendment to the pension law to increase statutory retirement age. The amendment
was widely debated and consulted with trade unions, employer organizations, women's
organizations, farmers’ unions, the tripartite committee 26 as well as with NGOs and think tanks.
Public debate forum on the changes to the retirement age legislation was established by the
Presidential Administration. The consultation was extended beyond the period provided by the
guidelines to more than two months. Inputs of this consultation process were reflected in the final
draft of the amendments.

49.    The Bank has collaborated closely with the IMF and the European Commission
(EC) on this program. The staff of the Bank and the Fund collaborated closely, with exchanges on
macroeconomic, fiscal and structural reforms. The measures under the proposed DPL program have
been discussed with both the IMF and the EC to ensure that they reinforce and complement their
support to Poland.




25 The Ministry of Economy has developed guidelines called Principles of Consultations Carried out upon Preparation of
Government Documents.
26 Tripartite Commission (Komisja Trójstronna) was established as a forum for national social dialogue in 1994, under a

'State Enterprise Pact'. It includes representatives of the trade unions, employers and the Government.



                                                         18
                       V.       OTHER DESIGN AND APPRAISAL ISSUES
5.1. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT
50.      The DPL2 prior actions related to fiscal consolidation and fiscal institutions are
likely to support poverty reduction. Fiscal consolidation and the introduction of fiscal rules are
critical to maintaining capital market access and thus to support investments and employment. Key
components of social safety net spending are excluded from measures underpinning the fiscal
consolidation process, thereby maintaining support to the most vulnerable. Moreover, the policy
actions supported under pillars I and II of the DPL2 are expected to contribute indirectly to the
improvement of living standards through strengthened stability and solvency of public finances.

51.      The DPL2 prior action related to the increase in the mandatory retirement age is
expected to raise pension benefits, especially for women. 27 Data from the 2010 LFS show that
among those 50 or older, nearly 40 percent of women and 30 percent of men are retired and that
most people retired at the applicable mandatory retirement age. If workers continue to respond in a
similar way, a gradual increase in the retirement age will likely increase the years spent in the labor
market. In addition, the increase in the retirement age will partially offset the trend of diminishing
benefits, all else being equal. Simulations based on earnings data from the LFS show that there are
significant gains in pension benefits from postponing retirement, especially for women. For men and
women who start working and enter the labor market in 2011, simulations show that under the
defined contribution system postponing retirement increases pension benefits (as a share of
economy-wide wages). 28 This gain in pension benefits will be experienced by workers of all
education levels. Since tertiary educated workers earn more than those with less education, the
simulated pension benefits are higher (Box 2). 29

52.      Given the slow phase-in of the increase in the retirement age, no adverse impacts are
expected on wages or on unemployment rates. Keeping workers in the labor force longer has
the potential for exerting downward pressure on wages, but this is mitigated by several factors,
especially by the slow phase-in of the increased retirement age, the shrinking size of the working age
population under the current retirement ages and the fact that it is not retroactive, so that current
retirees are not forced back into the labor force. Older workers who cannot find employment or
who are too disabled to work have safety nets in the form of social assistance and disability
pensions, respectively. Other mitigating considerations are that many pensioners are already working
in retirement, and tend to have different skill sets from younger workers. Thus, they are unlikely to
be competing with new entrants for jobs. Pension benefits are an important source of transfers for
households. Simulations suggest that all else equal, in the absence of national pension benefits, the
five-dollar-a-day poverty rate would go up from 15 percent to 35 percent. These simulations also
suggest that if the replacement rates (pensions as a share of average wage) decline, as they are

27 The PSIA focuses on the impact of retirement age increase, ceteris paribus. The impact of any other policy changes
would need to be assessed separately and monitored from an old-age poverty and income security perspective.
28 For example, if men with tertiary education entering the labor market in 2011 retire at age 67, then they will receive an

initial pension that is 63 percent of economy-wide or prevailing wages; if they retire early at 65 then their initial pension
is 57 percent of economy-wide wages. The gains in postponing retirement are larger for women. Assuming that tertiary-
educated women entering the labor market in 2011 have an uninterrupted tenure in the labor market, postponing
retirement to age 67 will give them a pension that is 50 percent of economy-wide wages as opposed to pension benefits
that are less than 40 percent of wages if they retire early at 60 or 62.
29 A recent study, based on a 1 percent sample of Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) contributors, finds little or no

gender gap in benefits when administrative data on reported earnings are used for simulations.



                                                            19
  projected to do in the future even with the retirement age increase, then the poverty reducing impact
  of pension benefits will be significantly diluted.

Box 2. Pensions Design in Poland: Responding to Gender Differences
The increase in the mandatory retirement age and closing of gender             Figure 5. Employment Rate by Age, 2010
differences in the retirement age help improve gender equality. But gender
gaps in the labor market and women’s primary care-giver role at home can
limit these gains. Employment rates are the lowest for younger and older
women – a pattern consistent with care responsibilities which the early
retirement option for women supported (Figure 5). As pension benefits
simulated using the LFS data show (Figure 6), for all cases and education
categories, men’s pension benefits are higher than those of women’s. The
“Reconciliation between work and family life in 2010? survey conducted
by the Polish Central Statistical Office found that women, rather than
men, reduced work responsibilities or withdrew from work in order to
take care of children or care for elderly dependent. A qualitative study on
gender issues conducted in Poland as part of the 2012 World
Development Report on Gender Equality also confirmed that the care

women.
At the same time, the reform will leave unchanged key features of the             Figure 6. Simulated First Year Pension

contributory periods, such as when employed women take their maternity         (As share of economy-wide wage in the first year

new law women can avail of the partial pension option at age 62; c) family
(or survivor) pensions support those women who either never entered the
labor market or who earned less than their husbands.
The recent increase in the mandatory retirement age (supported by the
DPL series) gives women additional years to make up for lost the labor
market time due to the child birth or child care. However, older women’s
care responsibilities (looking after parents or grandchildren) will still
compete with longer stays in the labor market. The availability of survivor
pensions will, in the short term, remain important for women’s income in
the old age. They are, however, inadequate “fixes? for interventions in the
labor market that help increase women’s labor market participation and
earnings and thus have the most potential to also raise women’s pension        Source: Staff estimates using PROST model for Poland
benefits.


  53.    The reform to uniformed services pensions is not expected to have an impact on
  poverty. Because those employed in uniformed services tend to be in upper income quintiles, these
  reforms to the pension system are not expected to adversely affect their retirement income.

   54.    By increasing the eligibility thresholds for the minimum-income benefits, the social
   assistance reform supported by the DPL2 will help to reduce poverty incidence and depth
   by increasing the coverage and generosity of the program. 30 First, the program coverage will

  30 There are a number of methodological challenges for the PSIA in accurately assessing poverty impact of the reform.
  First, the main source of household survey data, HBS, does not separate social assistance in the form of cash and kind.
  However, applying the eligibility threshold for cash transfers it is possible to infer which households are recipients of in-
  kind transfers. Second, the HBS data also do not distinguish between permanent and temporary cash beneficiaries – a
  distinction that is important for evaluating the effect of the reform on single-person households that face different

 increase by extending benefits to those whose incomes are above the current thresholds but below
 the new thresholds. When the new threshold is applied, the share of the population eligible for the
 program by the income criterion is simulated to increase from 8.0 to 12.3 percent. Second, the
 program generosity will increase as benefits to current beneficiaries increase in line with the increased
 thresholds. The increase in minimum-income thresholds partially reverses the erosion in the value
 of the benefits due to inflation since thresholds were last set in 2006. Thresholds and benefits are
 adjusted for inflation infrequently in Poland, leading to minimum-income thresholds falling below
 the subsistence minimum threshold. The minimum-income benefit thresholds set in 2012 are once
 again greater than the subsistence minimum. Even so, for single-person households the new
 thresholds are less than the 2006 thresholds after adjusting for inflation adjusted using the food
 CPI adjusted using the total CPI. Infrequent adjustments for inflation will reduce the real value of
 the 2012 thresholds until adjustments are made next in 2015. The overall design of the reform
 produces progressive incidence of benefits. The benefits for those who become eligible for the
 program under the higher thresholds will be modest, because their incomes are closer to the
 threshold (Table 9). Similarly, those who are recipients before the reform are the poorest
 households, and post-reform their benefits increase by an average of PLN 34 to PLN 69 per person
 per month, reaching an average of PLN 136 to PLN 272, depending on what portion of their 50
 percent share local governments actually pay out. The real value of the benefits will diminish
 because of inflation until thresholds are adjusted again in 2015.

Note: The 50 percent and 100 percent columns indicate the amounts corresponding to receiving 50 percent of the
benefit amount (the guaranteed amount from the central government) and 100 percent (the combined amount from
central and local governments). Simulations take into account PLN 20 per capita minimum payments to recipient
households and apply a PLN 529 benefit cap on all single-person households.

 55.     The introduction of an income threshold and strict eligibility guidelines for the
 special caregiver benefit are expected to limit the take up to low-income care providers.
 Income thresholds have been introduced for relatives of disabled adults who wish to act as
 caregivers; the attendance benefits for mother or father of disabled children will not be subject to
 income tests, as before. In order for a caregiver to be eligible, the sum of their own income and that
 of the care receiver’s family must be PLN 623 per person per month or less. In addition, the

benefit caps depending on whether they are permanent or temporary beneficiaries. The PSIA simulates the effect of the
reform on single-person households by applying the benefit cap for permanent beneficiaries to all single person
households.

caregiver must neither be engaged in income generating work nor be a recipient of any other
benefits (pensions, disability benefits, parental leave allowance). Qualifying caregivers receive PLN
520 per month. The combined effect of the eligibility criteria and the benefit amount is expected to
improve poverty targeting, but will limit the coverage of those eligible. One reason for the expected
limited coverage is that the amount of the caregiver benefit, PLN 520 per month, is about 33
percent of the average wage for personal-service workers and caregivers could potentially earn
more by opting to work. Another reason for the expected coverage decline of this benefit is the
exclusion of those potential caregivers receiving any other benefit even if they meet the income
threshold. The incidence of such cases is very limited, but going forward it is important to monitor
them.
5.2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
56.     The specific policies supported by the DPL series are not likely to have significant
effects on Poland’s environment, forests, water resources, habitats or other natural
resources. The risk of unanticipated adverse effects to the environment and natural resources is
very small. Credible scenarios for any significant, direct or indirect negative impacts appear very
unlikely. Poland has adequate environmental controls in place and environmental legislation and
regulations are closely aligned with EU environmental directives (e.g. EIA Directive 85/337/EEC,
as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC). Poland has adopted the EU’s guidelines on
integration of environmental assessments into the planning and programming of projects (June
2001) and the EU’s Environmental Liabilities Directive setting out liability for damage to properties
and natural resources (April 2007). Since the country's accession to the EU in 2004, Polish
environmental authorities have rapidly developed technical skills and administrative structures
required for effective licensing, monitoring and enforcement. Thus any impacts potentially caused
by measures in the DPL operation would be captured by the established processes for screening
and assessing projects, and for ensuring that appropriate responses for impact minimization,
mitigation and management are included in project designs.
5.3. FIDUCIARY, DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING ASPECTS
57.      The overall fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland’s public financial
management system (PFM), the use of budget resources and its foreign exchange
environment as controlled by the Central Bank is moderate. Following significant
improvements during EU accreditation process, the PFM system encompasses enhanced budget
transparency, predictability and performance-orientation over the medium term. The reform
agenda (based on the 2009 PFA, amended in 2010) introduced a performance-oriented four year
rolling budget planning with a binding annual cash-based budget, cash management consolidation,
and strengthened internal audit, internal and management control over public expenditures and
debt via new regulations on corrective actions triggered by debt thresholds. Public procurement
legislation is based on EU Directives with the most recent update in 2012 on defense and security
directive. Further efforts are expected to streamline the flow of funds processes, harmonize public
sector accounting, reporting standards and practices supported by enhanced IT systems.

58.     The MoF discloses publicly the state budget act along with the monthly and
quarterly state budget execution reports based on a national cash methodology covering
main revenue and expenditures aggregates within 1-2 months after the end of a period. It
also publishes quarterly aggregate reports on budget execution by LGs. Annual cash based reports
on the central state budget execution are published after being audited by the Supreme Audit
Office (NIK) within 6 months after the end of the year. Accrual based ESA’95-compliant reports


                                                22
for the general government are available on quarterly basis on the website of the MoF, the Central
Statistical Office, and Eurostat within 3-4 months from the end of the quarter. The functional
breakdown of general government expenditures is presented within 12 months.

59.     In the area of external audit, Poland has a well-functioning public financial
accountability and assurance mechanism for the legislature and the public. Poland is
advanced in the availability of the audit reports to the public, and independence of the NIK. At the
LG level, 16 Regional Accounting Chambers the responsibility to supervise and control financial,
fiscal and procurement activities of self-governing entities. The PFA also requires that annual
financial statements prepared by large LGs be audited by independent statutory auditors. In the
area of internal audit, a Public Finance Sector Audit Department of the MoF coordinates
management control and internal audit in public finance sector units, which follow International
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.

60.     The NBP accounting and reporting policies are defined by the Monetary Policy
Council, and are in line the guidelines of the European Central Bank. In managing the
foreign exchange reserves, while striving to maximize the return on the assets, the NBP gives
priority to their safe investment and a requisite level of liquidity. An independent auditor selected
by the Monetary Policy Council regularly audits the NBP’s annual financial statements. The most
recently available audit reports (for 2004-2011) have unqualified audit opinions and were approved
by the Monetary Policy Council. The IMF latest limited scope safeguard assessment report of 2009
confirmed that the control environment of the NBP is satisfactory.

61.     Loan proceeds will be disbursed in one single tranche to the foreign currency
national budget account at the NBP, which forms part of the country’s foreign currency
reserves, and of the country’s budget management system. Disbursements will not be linked
to specific purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The Bank will not
require an audit of the Deposit account but will require the Government to provide confirmation
to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account within 30 days of receiving
the funds.
5.4. IMPLEMENTATION MONITORING AND EVALUATION
62.     The Bank continues to work closely with the MoF, the Prime Minister’s Office and
sector ministries to monitor and assess the reforms’ progress and impact during the course
of the program. Monitoring and evaluation is supported by the various ministries as well as
budgetary, legislative and economic data provided by the authorities and verified in official
disclosures, directives and regulations. Baseline and updated data are provided by the respective
specialized agencies and official statistics. They are tracked according to the indicators and outcome
measures shown in the monitoring and results framework of the policy matrix (Annex 1).

                             VI.     RISKS AND MITIGATION
63.    The overall risk to the operation is moderate.

64.     Macroeconomic risks are related to external and domestic factors. External risks stem
primarily from the slow Euro area economic recovery and are transmitted through external trade
and financial links. Further weakening of demand in the EU could place pressures on Poland’s
exports and investment growth. Over a half (53 percent) of total Polish exports during the first half
of 2012 went to the Euro area and a bit over one quarter to Germany. In addition, potential


                                                 23
instability in the Euro area could have spillover effects and negatively affect Poland through the
exchange rate channel. Since FX-denominated bonds constitute around 31 percent of total public
debt, Poland’s debt-to-GDP ratio is vulnerable to PLN depreciation. Moreover, with about 60
percent of the banking system owned by Euro area banks, Poland remains vulnerable to external
debt deleveraging through parent bank funding of local subsidiaries. Also, the level of NPLs
remains elevated. Domestic risks relate to the impact of slowing economic growth (in particular
private consumption) on the pace of fiscal consolidation. In addition, the Government is currently
contemplating measures related to the pension liabilities which could have an impact on the long-
term fiscal sustainability. Annuity provision from the private pension funds may result in increasing
Government liabilities if public institutions, rather than private, take on the longevity risk in
providing annuities. In the short and the medium term, such a measure would improve the fiscal
balances as funds held in private pension funds come in as revenue to the public system. However,
in the longer run, the public system takes on the additional liability of providing pensions from
these funds.

65.      There are a number of mitigating factors against the macroeconomic risks,
including: (i) flexible monetary policy will continue to cushion the impact of external shocks; (ii)
the solid track record of macroeconomic management will help to shore up market confidence as
long as credible commitment and implementation of medium-term fiscal and structural reforms is
observed; (iii) the significant prefunding of government’s financing needs and a large liquidity
cushion have helped mitigate the impact of external risks; (iv) the medium-term off-budget
investment program will help sustain the financing of pro-growth investment, without disturbing
the fiscal consolidation path; (v) the strong record of utilization of EU structural funds will
continue to support investment and growth; and (vi) ongoing strong policy dialogue on fiscal
issues, including in the social sectors. The key mitigating factors against the financial sector risks
include adequately capitalized (CAR at 15 percent in 2012), liquid, and profitable banks and an
effective and strong financial supervision. The banking system’s moderate loan-to-deposit ratio
helps mitigate deleveraging risk (an overall loan-to-deposit ratio of 113 percent and an average
loan-to-deposit ratio of just under 100 percent for banks with parents in European economies
under stress). Deleveraging was so far outpaced by the growth of domestic deposits. The
authorities have taken steps to strengthen the financial sector, including through tightening
standards on foreign currency lending to households. Further, the authorities could draw on the
FCL with the IMF (US$34 billion), which so far has been treated as strictly precautionary.

66.      Political discontent against reforms could potentially undermine support for the
Government’s agenda and reduce its ability to implement the needed fiscal and structural
reforms. Loss of support to the agenda of strengthening public finances could induce loss of
consumer and investor confidence and entice market volatility. The key mitigating factors against
this risk are the Government’s strong electoral mandate from the parliamentary elections in 2011
and its strong reform implementation record to date. Albeit with a small majority, the ruling
coalition has been effective in securing political support for its reform agenda. The next
parliamentary elections will be held in 2015.

67.       There are no other significant risks to the operation. The poverty and social impacts of
policy measures supported under this DPL series are expected to be either positive or negligible
(Section 5.1.). There are no likely risks arising from the program on Poland’s environment, forests, water
resources, habitats or other natural resources (Section 5.2.). The fiduciary risks are moderate due to the
advanced PFM system in the country and the management of foreign exchange by the NBP
(Section 5.3).

   Dear Mr. Kim,

   Uneer the second term of office of Prime Minister Tusk, the Polish Government is pll!Suing
   a comprehensive program of economic and social reforms, the aim of which is to strength:n the
   ecooomy in coping with negative spillovers from the ongoing financial and economic rurbulence
   in the external environment. The World Bank has played a significant role in supponing this
   agenda through lending projects, technical assiSlanee and knowledge sharing, for which I am
   Vei)' grateful.


   I am writing to request your approval of the programmatic Public Finance Development Policy
   Loa1 (OPT..), for BUR I billion. The loan is the second in a series of two lending operatiom. The
   first loan was presented to the IBRD Board of Executive Directors in June 2012. The current
   operation, prepared in close collaboration with the World Bank, builds directly on the fiscal
   reforms supported by the first loan and is targeted at reforms most critical for strengthening the
   sustainability of public finances and fostering growth.

   Matroeconomic Framewo rk
   In lite past four years, in spite of the uncertain external environment. Poland's CCOIOmic
   fun(amentals have remained strong, underpinned by ~und macroeeonomic policie3. As
   a consequence, Poland has enjoyed the highest economic growth among the EU countries. This
   strong performance can be credited to Poland's considerable diversification of the economy,
   limi:ed external imbalances prior to the crisis and the pntdent macroeconomic policies. Counter-
   cyclical policies were vital to lessening the economic slowdown, however, a crucial side effect
   thereof were higher fiscal deficit and public debt levels. In response, strong fiscal consolidation
   efforts were initiated in 2011, which reduced the general government deficit from 7.9 percent of
   GOP in 2010 to 3.9 percent in 2012 and put public debt-to-GOP ratio on a downward path.
   Going forward, despite a significantly weaker growth outlook, the Polish Government is
   commined to maintaining a balanced approach of pursuing conservative fiscal policy, while
   acti•·ely supporting economic growth in the private sector. lbese efforts are aimed at further


                                                  27
trimming the structural deficit towards Poland's medium-term objective and ensuring further
reduction in debt-to-GOP ratio.

Go\'ernment Program
The Government is committed to continuing the reform program announced after the
Parliamentary elections in October 2011 and reiterated in the Prime Minister's speech to the
Parliament in autumn 2012. Given the prolonged uncertainty in the external environment and the
slowdown in the Po lish ~nomy, the short-term reform agenda is focused on further rebuilding
fiscal buffers, supporting private sector-driven growth, and increasing the resilience of the
financial sector. At the same time, the authorities will remain devoted to pursuing reforms aimed
at improving public finances over the medium and long term.

In 2013, in order to consolidate public fi na nces., we strive to continue to control the expenditure
side of the budget through a temporary fiscal rule, limiting growth of discretionary expenditures
to I percentage point over the CPI rate, further phnsing-out of early retirement schemes and
a nominal freeze of the public sector wage bill. On the revenue side we rely on maintaining the
freeze of PIT thresholds and on one-off revenues from C02 emission rights and revenues from
the new toll system. Thanks to the measures already undertaken and carried out further fiscal
consolidation, structural deficit will be reduced in 2013 and subsequent years.

To support private sector growth, a new program was announced, consisting of guarantees for
SME lending and a government investment fund. The latter is aimed at providing financial
resources for investment into energy, infrastructure and R&D in Poland . Using privatization
proceeds to boost the capital base of the state development hnnk (Bank Gospodarstwa
Krajowego), the Government intends to mobilize resources held by private investors to support
investment in Po land. In addition, further improvements to the doing business environment are
being introduced by simplifying court procedures and extending rights to secured creditors in
businesses closures. We have also launched the first professional occupation deregulation
package to improve access to many professions.

Reform efforts have continued since 20 II in the area of strengthening the resilience of the
financial sector. There is ongoing work on developing a formal macroprudential framework,
which would establish a Systemic Risk Board and set forth the policy objectives of
a macroprudential function. With the help form the World Bank and the IMF, Poland is just
about to finalize the legislative proceedings regarding the banks' resolution framework. The
draft law has been sent for interministerial consultations and included in the Government's
legislative plan for2013.

Additional reform efforts are also aimed at strengthening fiscal institutions and increasing
sustainability of public finances over the medium and long term.

To strengthen fiscallnslltutlons, in line with the recently ratified EU fiscal requirements, we
will implement a permanent stabilizing expenditure rule to limit the growth of expenditures to
the:: Lrend gruwLh rettc- of ODP. This will eru;ure further fiscal consolidation and reinforce the
long-term stability of public finances. The Government has closely monitored the indebtedness
of the local government sector and introduced regulations to strengthen the quality of multi-year
financial forecasts by local governments. Over the medium-term, it is also committed to
program-based budgeting to improve the efficiency of public spending.

To ensure the sustainability of the pension system, the statutory retirement age was increased to
67 years for both men and women. This law was implemented in January 2013. The special
pension schemes for the uniformed services have also undergone reform. Starting January 2013,
for the new entrants into the uniformed services a minimum retirement age was established and
their length of service increased. The Government remains firmly committed to further efforts in
the area of pensions - including reviewing entitlements to early pensions of other professional
groups (inrer alia miners), establishing a pay-out mechanism from the second pillar and
reviewing the functioning of the second pension pillar.

In hcallh policy, one of the key actions aims to introduce the costing of health services with the
objective of improving incentives and transparency of financing in the hospital sector, as part of
a larger reform program. The plan is to bundle the creation of this tariff agency with reforms
aimed at abolishing the central agency of the health insurance fu nd and conferring its powers to
regional agencies, and at creating a new central agency responsible, in addition to the valuation
of medical services, for health technology assessment, quality assurance, the development of
health information systems and the oversight of public health insurers. The Ministry of Health is
also working on reforms in the area of clinical hospitals, the reimbursement of drug costs,
supplementary health insurance and clinical trials.

The scope of the planned reforms in the agricultural sector was also extended. In order to bring
farmers into the regular tax net in 20 I 4, the decision to introduce income accounting and income
taxation for farme rs in two phases was revised in favor of a o ne· step approach.

In order to improve targeting and increase beneftts for the poorest people in a fiscally neutral
way, social assistance benefits were reformed. The introduction of income testing helps to target
the benefit to care-givers of the adult disabled. The savings achieved under the care-giver beneftt
reform were used to augment the minimum income benefit to the poorest. Going forward, the
Government will continue to provide protection for the poor along with promoting integration of
excluded populations into the labor market. The Ministry of Labor is embarking on an ambitious
program to improve the quality of employment services provided. Such reforms will serve to
ensure that the poorest and most excluded populations also receive d ividends in future growth
and prosperity.

I strongly believe that the World Bank can provide valuable support to our reform program. The
World Bank's financial assistance and expertise is a crucial impetus towards the fulfillment of
the program objectives.


Yours Sincerely,

               Press Reiease No. 13/17
               Januaf')' 18, 20 13
               The Executive Board of t he International Monetary Fund
               ( IMF) today approved a successor two-y ear arr angem ent
               for Poland under t he Flexible Credit Une {FCL) in an
               amount equivalent to SOR 22 billion ( about US$33.8 billion,
               or 1,303 percent of quota).

               Poland's first FCL arrangem ent was approved on May 6,
               2009 (see Press Release No. 0911 53). Successor
               arrangements wer e approved on July 2, 2010 (see Pr ess
               Release No. 101276), and January 21, 2011 (see Press
               Release No. 11115). The Polish authorities have stated that
               they intend to treat the arrangement as precautlona.-y and
               do not intend to draw on t he FCL.

               Following the Executive Board discussion of Poland, Mr.
               David Upton, First Deputy Managing IJin=:rtn r ~nd Act1ng
               Chairrran of the Soard, made the following statement:

               ''Poland has very strong economic fundamentals and policy
               frameworks . A credible inflation targeting reg1me has
               helped contah'l innation, while the flexible exchange rate
               has played a key stabilizing role, and the sound financial
               superv sory framewor k has contributed to a well -
               capitalized, liquid, and pr ofitable banking system . Broadly
               adequate international reserves and t he precaut1onary FCL
               arrangement have helped maintain m arket confidence.

               underpinned Poland's sohd recovery in 2010-11, allowing a
               gradual restoration of policy buffers despite t he challenging
               external environment. These efforts lndu::led substantial
               fiscal consolidation, steady reserve accumulation, m easures

growth env•ronment may also make the country more
vulnerable to external shocks. Against this background, a
successor two-year FCL arrangem ent, w hich the authorities
intend to continue to treat as precautionary, will bolster
Poland's buffers against heightened external risks, help
sustain market confidence, and contmue to support the
authorities' overall macroeconomic strategy;· Mr. Upton
said.

The FCL was established on March 24, 2009 and further
enhanced on August 30, 2010 (see Press Release No.
10/321). The FCL IS avauaote to countries w•th very strong
fundamentals, polides, and track records of policy
implem entation and is particularly useful for crisis
prevention purposes. FCL arrangem ents are appr oved for
countries meeting pre-set qualification criteria (see Press
Release No. 09/85). The FCL Is a renewable credit line,
which could be approved for either one or two years. Two-
year arrangements involve a rev1     ew of eligibility aftet the
first year. lf the country draws on t he -credit line, the
r epaym ent period is between three and five years. There is
no cap on access to fund resources under the FCL, and
access Is determined on a case-by-ca$e basis. Qualified
countries have the full amount available up-front, with no
ongoing conditions. There is flextbility to either draw on the
credit line at the t ime it is approved, or treat it as
precautionary.

Poland Is a member or the IMF Stnce 1986 and has a quota
of SDR 1,688.40 million (about US$2,594.28 million).
