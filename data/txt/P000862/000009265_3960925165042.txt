pREEACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Water Supply Technical
Assistance and Rehabilitation Project in Ghana, for which Credit 1342-OH, in the amount of SDR
11.8 million (US$13.0 million equivalent) was approved on March 29, 1983. The credit was
closed on June 30, 1990, three years behind schedule. Disbursements against commitments were
made until October 31, 1990, and an outstanding balance of US$0.33 million was cancelled.
Tme PCR was jointly prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country
Department IV, Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and HI), and the Borrower
(Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision mission of
the project in June 1990, aAd is based on the President's Report; the Development Credit and
Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between tbe Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROECT COMPLEIMON REPORT

(CREDIT 1342 - GH)
EVALIATlQIOUMMARX
Objectiyes
1.        Intended. The project objectives were: fi to strengthen the managerial capabilities
of the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC) both at headquarters and in the districts
and to improve its operating efficiency and financial performance; sAend to carry out emergency
repairs to the Kpong-Tema-Accra transmission pipeline, to secure a reliable water service to the
Accra and Tema urban area, and to improve the distribution system in those areas; and ihir to
prepare detailed plans for future investment projects (para 3.02).
2.         Acieved: The need to strengthen GWSC, the entity responsible for water supply
throughout the nation, had been clearly indicated by its performance during previous projects and
by the adverse effects of the exodus of large numbers of people at professional, technical and
managerial levels during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The choice of the primary objective was
totally correct and fully jusjified but was far more difficult to achieve than expected. Efforts were
impeded by lack of adequate financing for day-to-day operations and m_atenance and for local
counterpart funding of development projects. Technical assistance and training were also impeded
by an inability to recruit staff on the terms which GWSC was permitted to offer or even to retain
valued upper level and middle level professionals in the face of more attractive offers from the
private sector and from neighboring countries. Tbis situation continues to persist (para 6.01).
3.         Although the primary objective was not fully achieved, and much has still to be
accomplished before GWSC may be regarded as a well managed, well taffed, effective water
corporation, the project limited the erosion of GWSC's operating ability that would have occurred
I   .       but for the substantial input of technical assistance under the project. Furthermore, persistent
actions taken and pressures exerted on the Government throughout the course of the project, to
increase tariffs and settle arrears for water services to Government departments (para 6.05),
improved GWSC's financial position (para 6.04).
4.         The second objective was achieved as planned, and the emergency repairs of the
pipeline and the distribution system improvements achieved widespread benefits for urban
dwellers. The third objective was partially achieved through the preparation of a feasibility study
leading to a national water sector rehabilitation project; however, detailed engineering designs
were not carried out under this project (para 6.03).



-iv-
S.         With the excepdon of difficulties usociated with delayed provision of counterpart
funds by the Government, project implementation was relatively troubIe free. Although delays
occurred they did not have serious implications. In rtospec, there was no apparent solution to
the delays in the provision of counterpart fundwing since the decline in the national economy meant
that the Government faced many more demand than could be met from dwindling resources.
Delays in carryirS out the preparatory work for futurc investment projects, although not a serious
issue, if avoided could have resulted in the follow-on project achieving a more advanced stage at
the time of appraisal (para 5.02).
6.         The estimated cost of the proiect was USS22.4 million of which US$9.4 million
equivalent were local costs. IDA financed US$12.67 million, or 57% of the total appraisal cost.
The actual prle cost was USS18.21 million (Table 4A). Planned project completion was June
30, 1987 (Table 2). Actual project completion was in June 1990. The credit was disbursed until
October 31, 1990.
ha,abilily
7.         Results of the institutional strengthening aspects of the project have not been
encouraging. GWSC is still desperately short of professional staff at upper and middle levels.
Tariffs are again below the levels required to finance operaCons and maintenance, debt service
and a portion of C;WSC's investment program (paras 7.01 - 7.02). Physical components of the
project are more positive. 'The Kpong-Tema-Accra pipeline repairs are satisfactory, although
these works corrected only the most urgent aspects of pipeline rehabiitation and more long term
rebabilitation work needs to be done.
Findings and Lesson
8.         lTe PCR indicates that the primary objective of the project, institution building, was
not as successfully achieved as had been envisaged during project preparation. A somewhat
inappropriate approach tu institutional strengthening, in addition to the Government's reluctance to
support the provision of incentives to enable GWSC to recruit adequate staff, contributed to the
partial fai!ure to fully achieve this objective. The PCR also indicates that the remaining
objectives, most of which were physical in nature and therefore more easily achievable, were
much more successfil. Difficulties also resulted from the Government's reluctance to agree to
tariff increases until quite late in the projec implementation stage and also its difficulty in
providing counterpart funding to meet the local cost component of the project.
9.         By far the most critical factor in the success or failure of water supply operations
and development is the strength of the sector entity, in this case a national entity. Ciearly, the
strength of an entity depends largely on the number and ability of individual members of its staff.
The Bank's support for strengthening this institution was appropriate. A lesson to be considered
for future operations of this nature concerns selection of the form and approach to institutional



siengthening. Recruitment and on-the-job training of indigenous staff has several advantages
over the widespread use of expatriates. Clear advantages relate to sustainability, cost,
acceptability (and hence local support). Intentions at appraisal were to use quite a large number
of expatriates to "put the house in order' and train counterpart staff. The need to first restructure
the terms of service for GWSC staff, or provide other incentives and to gain Government support
for these reforms was not apparent until too late. As a result, the expatriates had few counterpart
staff to train and when the expatriates left after three years or so, the void in GWSC remained. A
subsequent training program (under a "twinning" contract with Thames Water Internaticnal
(TWI)) was marginally more successful, but a lack of adequate counterpart staff to train continued
to be a constraint,

2.     P    Backround
2.01       Sector Development Qbiectives. (At the time of project appraisal). Early in the
1980s the new Government recognized the need to undertake major economic reforms and
institutional changes to restore a basis from which sustained economic development could be
resumed. The Government formulated a comprehensive economic recovery progi-am in 1983,
requiring substantial suppqFt from international and bilateral institions. The Government
requested Bank assistance to encourage external assistance through cofinancing and strengthening
aid coordination. Objectives which guided the Bank's assistance program in Ghana included,
among others, an effort to. improve the country's essential infrastructure (transport, water, power)
to relieve constraints to increased production. Thus the immedhte objectives of both the
Government and the Bank with regard to the water sector were to: a) increase the proportion of
the population having access to potable water supplies, especially in rural and low income area;
b) improve system reliability and sanitation in urban areas; c) strengthen the financial viability of
the sector institution, the Ghana Water and Sewerage Corporation (GWSC); and d) strengthen
GWSC with emphasis on improving sector planning and project implementation capacity.
2.02       The Bank's Prior Involvement in the Sector. Prior to the Water Supply Technical
Assistance and Rehabilitation Project, the Bank financed two water supply and sewerage projects
in Ghana (Credits 160-GH and 499-GH) both of which were directed to the Accra-Tema
Metropolitan Area (ATMA).
2.03       The first project (US$3.5 million credit in 1969) assisted in expanding the water
supply distribution network in Accra-Tema and constructing a sewerage system in central Accra.
The project was completed in 1973 with a cost overrun of about 32% and a time delay on the
water supply and sewerage components of zi- months and two years, respectively. The
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Project Performance Audit Report (No. 1683 of July
29, 1977) on this project concluded that, while the objective of the water supply component was



-2-
met, the objective of the sewerae component was not fufly met becaute of the small percente
of potei user to connect to the system.
2.04       The second project (Credit 499-GH for US$10.4 million in 1974) was financed in
parallel with the African Development Bank and Canadian Internationl Development Agency. It
was intended to increase the insalled capacity of works serving ATMA to meet existing and
future neods for potable water for some 800,000 people in the Accra-Tema metropolis md to
extend water supply to some 170,000 people living in adjacent rural P.am. Although the IDA-
financed component, including construction of a 17m high earth dam at Woija, was completed in
1980, the entire project was not completed until mid-1985 about six years later than originally
envisaged. This was due to general shortages of materials and labor that affected civi works.
Cost overruns on the foreign currency component were held to 16% bv teduction of the project
scope pertaining to the distribution system extensions.
2.05       Tle institution building objectives of the first and second projects were not fully
achieved, in part because of a very high turnover of GWSC's top level officers, lack of
managerial autonomy from Government and overstaffing at the lower levels.
3.   Project Objectives and Description
3.01       Eroie  Qbiectiv. In line with sectoral objectives outlined in pars 2.01 above, and
in an attempt to better achieve institutional objectives which had had limited impact under the fis
and second projects, the third project was conceived only to provide technical assistance to
improve GWSC's capacity for planning and implementing development projects. However, afer
delays in the preparation phase of the project, and in response to a request from the Government
of Ghana and GWSC, the scope of the project was restructured to include urgent rebabilitation
works and additional technjcal assistance.
3.02       Ihe main objectives of the project at appras, were to: (a) strengthen the
managerial capabilities of (3WSC as a whole including its headquarters and area organizations so
that GWSC could more effectively plan and carry out futer development of the sector; (b)
improve GWSC's operating and financial perifrmance so that GWSC coud funcion as a viable
and efficient secr indtiton; (c) provide ertergency maintenance aod repairs to the Kpong-
Tema-Accra transmission pipeline and the distribution network in the Accn-Tema aea; and (d)
prepare detailed plans for suitable investment projec for possible future Bank Group financing.
3.03       Pflec QmpgnM. The project consisted of the following:
(a)   Provision of about 30 man-years of thical assistance to strengthen GWSC's
maagement by carrying out management duties and by providing on-the-job training
to its senior staff and assisting GWSC to carry out agreed recommendations of a
Management Improvement Ptogram (MM) Study (item (b) below).
(b)  A comprehensive Management Improvement Study of GWSC's orgaizaton, legal
statu, statutory duties, operations, finances, planning and control systems, staffing
and manpower deveiopment and traing.
(c)   Rehabilitation of the 42-inch diameter Kpong-Tema pipeline and the 32-inch
diameter Tema-Accra pipeline and ancillary structures including: (i) replacement of



corroded pipes and recoating of dumged sections with concrete encasement at
stream crossings; (ii) replacemeat of defective cathodic protection and repair or
replacement of defective valves; (iii) provision of maintenance equipment; and (iv)
related consultant services for surveys, designs, tender documents and construction
supervision.                                       I
(d)   A program of instalation, repair and maintenance of public standpipes in ATMA,
including the installation of about 100 public fountains, the repair of about 250
public fountains and the acquisition and utilization of spare parts, tools, water
meters, about 10 cars and pick-up trucks, about 50 mopeds and equipment and
materials for the maintenance thereof.
(e)   Preparation and execution of a program of surveillance and monitoring of the
hydrologic, environmental and public health conditions of the Weija Reservoir.
(f)   Preparation of designs and tender docu-ments for future water supply and sewerage
projects to be carried out by GWSC.
4.   Proiect Design and Organization
4.01       The project was initially designed as a technical assistance project with the objective
of strengthening GWSC and was appraised in 1978. Because of delays in processing the credit,
the project was restructured, reappraised in November 1980, and renegotiated in January 1983.
The project's original concept and objectives were maintained despite delays and changes during
the preparatory stages. The project concept and design were appropriate and timely in order to
.y to restore the capability and operational and development capacity of GWSC, a vital institudon
to the water sector, the hqeth and welfare of the people and the economic recovery of the
country.
4.02       The addition.of several rehabilitation components did not change the original basic
concept of the project. The focus on technical assistance to strengthen GWSC as originally
planned, was maintained. Without IDA support for GWSC through this substandal technical
assistance component, the effects on GWSC during the national economic depression when a
number of professional and technical staff left Gbana, may have been even more serious than
those actually experienced. Tbe project concept "as not innovative but was basically sound and
met the needs of the sector, and of the key sector institution, GWSC, at a critical period.
4.03       Although major institutional improvements and reforms envisaged at the time of
appraisal were not fully achieved, the decline of GWSC during this period of countrywide
economic depression would inevitably have been more severe but for the technical assistance input
provided under the project. The project was uncomplicated i its concept, it was of moderate size
(US$22.4 million) and was well within the implementation capability of GWSC.
5.01       loan Effectiveness and Proiect Stao-up. The credit (1342-GH) was approved on
March 29. 1983, signed on April 26, 1983 and became effective on November 15, 1983, some
four months after the planned date of July 26, 1983. This was not considered to be a serious



-4 
delay and was due primarily to allowing insufficient time in the original scheduling to satisfy four
conditiOns for credit effectiveness.
5.02       Implementation Schedule. The project was originally scheduled to be completed by
June 30, 1987. Although most of the rehabilitation works were completed by that date the
institutional strengthening component continued to early 1990 as did completion of the existing
training school at Weija, a component which was added to the project in September 1987. On the
institutional side, on June 29, 1988, a twinning contract of two-year duration was signed with
Thames Water International of the U.K. (TWI) to supplement the previous technical assistance
effort. The closing date was extended in 1988 and again in 1989 to allow these components to be
completed. This extension also provided an opportunity for completion of a component to
prepare a follow-on project, an item which was deferred until relatively late in the implementation
period.
5.03       Procurement. In the earlier stages of the project, procurement proceeded
satisfactorily. Prequalitication of bidders for the largest physical component in the project,
rehabilitation of the Kpong-Tema-Accra pipeline was completed by mid-1983, bids were received
in September 1983, a contract awarded in February 1984 and site work started in September
1984. Similarly, the MIP study team was mobilized as early as January 1984 and a five-man
technical assistance team was in position by February 1984. The remaining components, a
technical assistance contract with TWI and a feasibility study for the follow-on project, were late
in starting, due primarily to indecision rather than procurement difficulties. Throughout the
project, procurement followed Bank guidelines and was satisfactorily processed with minimal
delays.
5.04       PrgLect Costs. 'he estimated cost of the project at appraisal was US$22.4 million.
The final cost was about US$18.21 million as shown in Part 111, Table 4.
5.05       Disbursements. Estimated disbursements of Credit 1342-GH are shown in Part m,
Table 3. At the beginning of the implementation period disbursements were slower than those
estimated at the time of appraisal, primariiy due to overly optimistic forecasting. Disbursements
could not be expected in FY1983 as the credit became effective on November 15, 1983.
However, disbursements reached satisfactory levels in FY1984 - FY1988 and then declined in
FY1989 - FY1990 as major components were completed.
6.   Proiect Results
6.01            Q     jiect 9pjiecives. The extent of the exodus of managers and professional people in
all sectors throughout Ghana, and the results of that phenomenon, were not fully apparent at the
time of appraisal. The difficulties to be faced in strengthening GWSC's managerial capabilities
were therefore underestimated. Two pervasive and related issues impeded GWSC's recovery and
subsequent development, lack of adequate financing and an inability to attract effective upper and
middle level managers and technical staff. This situation persists, although. more recently
recruitment of junior professional staff has oeen reasonably successful.
6.02       Although GWSC's managerial capabilities were not improved to an extent envisaged
at the time of appraisal, the project to a large extent prevented the erosion of GWSC's operating
capability which otherwise would have resulted from the nationwide exodus of professionals. In
addition, there were positive improvements in GWSC's organizational structure, both at



. 5-
headquarts ad in the regions. Most imporantly, as a result of the project, GWSC's overall
fincial posidon was improved primarily through increased tariffs and payment of arrears for
water services by the Government.
6.03       PyAicalRes  . Toe physical objectives of the project were achieved substantWly
as outlined at appraisal. Emergency maintenance and repairs to the Kpong-Tema-Accra
transmission pipeline were completed, and leakage was reduced. Although much work on the
pipeline remains to be done, it is in operation. Similarly, distribution improvements in the Accra-
Tema area were completed as scheduled. A feasibility study in preparation for the follow-on
project (Water Sector Rehabilitation Project, Credit 2039) was completed.
6.04       Fbinial Pfr nc. Financial statements, including appraisal estimates and
audited results for FY 1982-88, for GWSC's consolidated and the ATMA operations are
presented in Annex 2. Consolidated GWSC and ATMA financial performance was far below
appraisal estimates through 1985. Operating losses were incurred during the early stages of the
project as the Government repeatedly delayed requested tariff increases. When finally granted,
high local inflation and a rapidly deteriorating exchange rate immediately eroded the effects of the
tariff measures. The Government provided operating subsidies to assist GWSC in meeting its
obligations, although iliquidity remained a serious problem for the Corporation. GWSC's overall
and ATMA financial results improved substantially beginning in 1986 as a consequence of
Government cumulative tariff action (increases of 500%, 1986; 25%, 1987; and 25%, 1988).
The audited 1986-88 financial statements show: (a) positive operating income; (b) an acceptable
liquidity level; (c) compliance with the principal financial covenants; and (d) a phasing out of
Government operating subsidies by 1986. The audited results must, however, be tempered by:
(a) understated revaluation of fixed assets and debt and related depreciation and debt service
charges; (b) substantial long-term debt contracted by the Government and onlent to GWSC but not
included in the financial sttements; (c) debt servicing requirements not met by the Corporation;
and (d) insufficient maintenance provisions. If these factors are considered, it is estimated that
GWSC's financial performance, although showing improvement in the later years of project
implementation, would haye been satisfactory only in 1986.
6.05       GWSC's overall accounts receivable (as percentage of sales) increased during project
implementation. Although GWSC increased its collection efficiency for private consumers, the
high level of Government arrears created serious liquidity problems. A Government clearing
house arrangement, established in 1989 is satisfactorily dealing with Government accounts.
6.06       GWSC, which relied and will continue to rely heavily on foreign exchange
borrowings to finance its investment program, has been particularly hard hit by the depreciation
of the Cedi against hard currencies. Under a follow-on Water Sector Rehabilitation Project,
approved in June 1989, GWSC's capital needs were restructured in light of its low debt service
coverage, inadequate working capital and substantial capital investment program. In addition, the
Corporation's fixed assets will be revalued to reflect replacement cost and the remaining usefil
life.
6.07       ImRact of the Project. The technical assistance components provided under the
project prevented what might well have been a total collapse of GWSC as an operating, national
water supply entity. The project provided a means whereby the Government of Ghana could be
made aware of the need for water tariff increases and the consequences of withholding authority
for such increases. In addition, the expatriate staff provided under the technical assistance

valuable asisc in day.tokday operations   well as traning.
6.08        bhe emergency repairs to the Kpong-Tema-Accra transmission pipeline enabled
GWSC to maintain the water supply service to the metropolitan area, subnantially without
interruption. Without this component, watr supply to the area would have ben, at bes,
intermittent and unreliable cauing widespread hardship to all sections of the community and
deterioration in the health of the urban people. Similarly, the improvemet of the distribution
system in ATMA, the provision and rehabilitation of public taps, and improvex supplies in water
deficient areas benefitted the poorer sections of the community.
7.   Project Sustainabiliq
7.01       The project created an awareness of the need for the Government to agree to a
realistic program of phased tariff adjustments, and to implement such a program in a timely
manner. Acceptance of this policy was, and continues to be, essential to the financial viability of
GWSC, allowing it to continue its day-to-day operations, adequately maintaining its more than
200 water systems throughout the country and to provide for future growth in the sector. These
issues continue to be addressed in the follow-on project (Water Sector Rehabilitation Project,
Credit 2039-OH).
7.02       Sustainability is also dependent on Government support for continued institutional
development, particularly in the area of raising the level of GWSC's management and operating
ability by providing incentives to enable GWSC to attract a-I retain qualified staff.
8.     _P      r     ,
8.01       Through the project the Bank provided significant institutional support to GWSC
enabling it to achieve an acceptable level of financial performance by the year 1986 against a
generally adverse economic climate. In addition, the provision of a relatively large program of
technical assistance enabled GWSC to continue to operate at an acceptable level of efficiency
despite the massive exodus of professional staff. Tbroughout the project, Bank performance was
satisfactory. However, in retrospect it appears that greater benefits may have been achievable by
adopting a modified approach to some of the difficulties faced by GWSC; these alternatives are
outlined as follows:
(a)  since adequate tariffs were so vital to the efficient operation of GWSC, patcularly
to the maintennce of its many essential water supply systems, the Bank could have
made stronger efforts to persuade the Government to introduce realistic tariff
adjustment programs;
(b)  technical assistance to support GWSC was clearly essential; however, the work of
the expatriate advisers provided under the project was hampered by a lack of suitable
GWSC staff to train; furthermore when the expatriates completed their work and
left, GWSC's improved management and operating efficiency was quickly eroded;
the basic deficiency, lack of qualified competent staff, remained; perhaps greater
benefit would have accrued by persuading the Government to provide suitable



.7 -
incenives to atract qualified Ghanaian staff, on a permaent basis for GWSC; (a
subsequnt twinning program with TWI was marginaily more succeusful); and
(c)  emergency maintenance and repair of the Kpong-Tema-Accra transmision pipeline
wa an essential component of the projea and was well implemnted; however, it is
questionable as to whether the Bank should have made a greater effort to asist
GWSC to seek grant, or other financing to enable all of the pipeline rehabilitation
work to be completed, much of which still remains to be done.
8.02       In view of the relatively modest size of the credit, and given the political and
economic background at the time of the project, it is probable that further pressures on the
Government would have been only moderately successfil.
9.   Borrower Performance
9.01       The status of covenants (Part III, Table 6) generally indicates the perbrmance of the
borrower (the Republic of Ghana) and GWSC. Except for the delays in submitting audited
accounts and delays in adjusting water tariffs the borrower's performance has been satisfactory.
The revaluation of GWSC's assets has proved to be a more difficult task than was originally
envisaged and has yet to be completed. The provision of counterpart funds by the Government
tended to be slow throughout the greater part of the project period. Procurement of works, goods
and services was expeditiously carried out throughout the project, and there were no major delays
with the possible exception of the appointment of consultants to prepare the follow-on project.
10.  Project Relationship
10.01      Bank relationship with the Government of Ghana and GWSC throughout the project
was excellent.
11.  Cgnsulting Seri
11.01      Individual consultants were employed to carry out management duties and provide
on-the-job training to GWSC senior staff. Despite the less than satisfactory relationships which
developed between local staff and the expatriate advisers, their performance was rated by Bank
supervision staff as being generally satisfactory.
11.02      The services of the Public Administration Service in association with Tahal
Consulting Engineers, Ltd. were obtained to carry out a study on GWSC manpower, staffing,
organization and management. The services of these consultants were satisfactory, as were those
of Tahal Consulting Engineers Ltd. when engaged for the Water Sector Rehabilitation Study
completed in September 1988.

and adequate data are generally available. GWSC provided a draft of Part I of the compleion

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTVE lie
1.   Adequacy a     acy of Factual Infornation in Part m
1.01      The country data as presented in Part m, were reviewed by GWSC and found to be
adequate and generally consistent with GWSC information.
2.   Evaluation of Bank's Performance aW Lesson Learnd
2.01       Bank missions were generally helpful. Initially when activities centered around
construction work the mission engineers gave sound advice. There was a major delay in
procurement of additional steel pipes, but fortunately this did not affect the project completion
period.
2.02       Discussions between Bank missions and the Borrower were cordial, each side
carefully considering the other's views. Consensus was thus reached on most issues. One
exception was that prourement issues were not always expeditiously resolved by missions but
were delayed while procurement officers at Bank headquarters were consulted.
2.03       During the fiveyear Rehabilitation and Developmeat Study, visits by Bank missions
were timely and advice and guidance were relevant, contributing to the high quality of the report.
However, as a result of a lack of guidance in the early stages of the study, the consultants were
required to spend additional time to amend the study and report as a result of input by Bank
missions during later stages of the work.
2.04       Ssons were learned during project implementation. First, procurement
contnrc  for the supply of materials, for use by the civil works contractor, should be sufficienldy
flexible to allow purchases to be made from other suppliers where such a course of action proves
to be advantageous. Second, procurement issues should be resolved expeditiously preferably
while the mission is still in the field by prompt communication with headquartrs where
necessary. Courses of instruction for the Borrower's procurement personnel would be beneficial.
In the case of long-term studies by consultants, terms of reference need to be carefully reviewed

changed and the original document is avahable in the project files.

by Bank staff prior to commencement of such studies, and at frequent intervals throughout the
course of the study so that adjustments may be made at early stages as results become available.
3.   Evaluation of the Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learned
3.01       Cooperation among the Bank, consultants and the Borrower was quite good. Data
requested were promptly presented when available. However, lack of certain types of data, such
as borehole records and planning reports, caused difficulties.
3.02       In project formulation and planning the implementing agency's performance was
quite creditable. However, serious delays occurred in payment of the Cedi portion of contractors'
claims. Fortunately the contractors did not stop work although interest on delayed payments had
to be met. These late payments did not affect the project completion period.
3.03       The TWI twinning contract was generally satisfactory. However, in some cases
TWI recommendations could not be fully implemented because of a lack of equipment and
manpower resources within GWSC. In addition, some of TWI staff were younger and less
experienced than GWSC staff. Attachment of GWSC personnel to TWI in the U.K. was not fully
successful because GWSC staff in the U.K. were not fully involved in TWI work and were not
given specific, achievable objectives. Conversely, the effectiveness of TWI personnel in Ghana
was reduced because GWSC staff were too fully committed to day-to-day duties to spare sufficient
time to coordinate fully with TWI staff.
3.04       Several lessons were learned: First, the Borrower's data storage and retrieval
systems need to be improved so that maximum benefits may be derived from such a project.
Second, adequate provision must be made to release local Cedi funds so that contractors' claims
may be promptly settled. Third, the Borrower should ascertain early in the program that
consultants, and organizatibns such as TWI will provide staff who are clearly more experienced
than GWSC's staff. Fourth, objectives cannot by fully achieved unless arrangements are made to
make available the requisite equipment and manpower. Fifth, arrangements should be made to
ensure that the Borrower's staff have sufficient time available from their day-to-day activities to
interact with their counterparts; and sixth, prior to acceptance of arrangements for attachment of
local staff to overseas organizations (such as TWI), the Borrower should look closely at the way
in which local staff will interact with the foreign organization to ensure that the time is spent
profitably.
