INTERNATICNAL DEVEIlPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PIDPOSED
CREDIT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A FLOOD REHABILITATION PROGRAM
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the
equivalent of US$35 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a
flood rehabilitation program and to provide imports to assist the recovery
of the economy from the effects of the flood of August, 1973. US$11.8
million would be relent to the Provin-es of Punjab and Sind on standard
IDA terms.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.         The most recent economic report "Economic Situation and Pros-
pects of Pakistan" (74-PAK, dated February 16, 1973) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on March 2, 1973 (R73-76). A country data sheet
is attached as Annex I.
3.         The economy of Pakistan (the former West Pakistan) grew rapidly
during the Second Plan (l960-65), with GDP increasing at 6.7 percent per
annum, compared with 5.6 percent for the entire count.y. This high growth
was spearheaded by an industrial growth of 13.1 percent per annum. How-
ever, agriculture grew by only 3.7 percent per annum. West Pakistan's
overall economic growth slowed down somewhat during the Third Plan
(1965-70) to about 6 percent per annum. The industrial growth rate fell
to 7.6 percent, but agricultural output grew at 5.6 percent annually with
the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice varieties, reducing, but not
eliminating, the food deficit.
4. 1       Though it is hardly apparent in these figures, Pakistan's
economic development began to encounter a number of difficulties after
1965. Import restrictions and other direct controls introduced at that
time became permanent as the shortage of foreign exchange and budget
resources persisted owing to higher defense expenditure, rising foreign
debt service, and decreased nonproject foreign aid. Both net capital
inflow and domestic savings declined, and investment fell from about 22
percent in GDP in 1964/65 to about 17 percent in 1969/70, and to only
11 percent in 1971/72. The slowdown in industrial growth, along with
urban population growth rates of more than 5 percent, led to a rapid rise
in urban unemployment. In rural areas, it was the larger farmers of West
Pakistan who got most of the benefits from the new "green revolution".
5.         The econoiy underwent severe strains during 1970/71 and 1971/72,
reflecting both political events and prolonged drought which virtually
halted the iricrease in agricultural output.  In 1972/73, however, the



- 2 -
aconoiy showed sigas of revival. With a recovery in industrial produc-
t on ann a record wheat crop of 7.4 million tons, GDP is estimated to
L-1GVe grown oy about 6 percent.  Devaluation in May 1972 has been succes-
'Ul in making Pakistani exports more competitive in international
marikets, in increasing incentives to produce for the local market, and
in bringing abouta much more liberal system of import control. Exports
rose by 35 percent in 1971/72 and by another 38 percent in 1972/73. In
1972/73, for the first time since 1950/51, the country had a trade sur-
plus. The State Bank's foreign exchange reserves, net of of IMNF position,
doubled to US$360 million in the year ended June 1973, although they
have since declined to US$317 million at the end of December.
O.         The roajor problems now facing Pakistan are to stimulabe out-
Dut and amployment, to control inflation, to increase public and
private saving and investment, and to improve the distribution of in-
come. Despite reasonably rapid growth in 1972/73, the domestic supply
oT essential consumptionr goods is still inadequate. Together with the
increased income resulting from the strong rise in exports, this has
been an iiportant factor behind the rapid rise in prices. Wholesale and
consumer prices increased 20 percent or more in 1972/73 reflecting -both
these dor,mestic pressures and sharp increases in international prices for
Pakistan's prinicipal exports (cotton, cotton textiles, and rice) and
imports. Since attempts to contain inflation through increased subsidies
and price controls were having but limited success, the Government last
summer took strong measures to curb demand. The flood caused a sharp
increase in prices in August and September but since then the cost of
living index has remained stable.
7.         The present high prices of r>akistan's major exports will
probably declirie, with adverse effects on the balance of payments and
public finances.  Recorded investment in real terms has not increased
much inthe current year, but there is evidence that unrecorded invest-
ment in small-scale industry and agriculture has been substantial. If
the necessary saving and investment are forthcoming) Pacistan's growth
prospects are good. Exports seem limited more by Supply constraints
rather than lack of demand (with the important exception of the textlle
quotias in importing countries).
B.         Water from Tarbela Dam will probably be available from the
end of 197L' and the increasing participation of small and medium-scale
farmers in the "green revolution" could mean that agricultural growth
in the :next 5 years will at least match the 5.6 percent annual rate of
the 1965-70 hnird Plan period. Capital goods, light engineering goods,
and agro-based industries also have good growth prospects.  The recent
rz-se in ohe oil price will obviously be a constraint on Pakistan's
growth but -h-e econory does have certain strengths which make it less
Lvuherable -o IThe oil shortage than most developing countries. Electric
power is derived. roughly equally from hydro resources and natural gas
wit1 orIly a vei7r small proportion based on oil. Furthermore, new hydro-power
WilI soon ,ecome available; by 1976, bydro-electric power generation is
ex-aeoted -to _e doible the 1973 level, which will add about 50 percent to
total outp-.   Pakistan a'so has a relatively open economy and its rapidly



- 3 -
growing exports will cushion the effect of oil prices on the balance of
payments.  Provided therefore that Pakistan can obtain foreign capital
and generate domestic savings sufficient to finance the necessary
investment, there are reasonable prospects that economic growth could
average about 7 percent annually over the next several years.
9.         Pakistan's external public debt at the end of December 1972
amounted to US$4.8 billion equivalent, of which US$870 million was
undisbursed. Pakistan's debt service, as at present scheduled, would
rise from USl80 million in 1972/73 to about US$400 million by 1975/76.
This rapid increase reflects the interim debt rescheduling operations
which were arranged in May 1972 and June 1973; it would mean a rise in the
debt service ratio from 18 percent in 1972/73 to aroul 30 percent in
1975/76. However, it is not likely that Pakistan will be called upon to
pay as much as this; countries which are members of the Pakistan
Consortium have agreed that, after July 1, 1974, Pakistan will not be
asked to service debts on account of projects visibly located in Bangla-
desh. Moreover, Consortium countries have agreed to consider providing
ifurther debt relief to Pakistan on a long-teim basis, and the Bank is
preparing a study on this subject for consideration by the Consortium.
10.        While such relief would certainly ease Pakistan's debt
burden, it will still be desirable for foreign aid to Pakistan to be on
terms as concessional as possible. For this reason, the major part of
Bank Group aid to Pakistan, including the financing proposed in this
report, should take the form of IDA credits.
PAPT II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
11.        The Bank ana IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan (total for East and Wbst) between the start of operations in
1952 and June 30, 1971. The Bank and IDA had committed US$1.2 billion
to the country, about one-half of which was provided by the Bank and
one-half by IDA. Of this amrunt, one loan and 19 development credits,
totaling USS4.7 million and US$168.1 million respectively (net of
cancellation) were for projects located wholly within what was then
East Pakistan and another 10 loans and 8 development credits involved
expenditures in both East and West Pakistan.
12.        In August 1972, Bangladesh became a member of the Bank and
IDA, and agreed to take over liability for all lOA credits made for
projects in its territory ihich were not completed. Accordingly, I1
credits in arn aggregate amount of US$151.4 million, to provide financing
for such pre-independence projects, have since been made to Bangladesh,
and the original credit agreements with Pakistan for such projects have
been terminated. Bangladesh has recently agreed to enter into dis-
cussions with all members of the Pakistan Consortium concerning the
assumption of liability for debts on account of projects visibly located
in Bangladesh. The Bank, too is holding discussions with Bangladesh with
a view to the taking over by Bangladesh of liability for the remaining



mancu.nt,s -t.ic  wec-r disbursed for the benefit of what is now Bangladesh
urider Eanic .oaris and !DA c.-edits to Pakistan.
13.        01 tne US$1.2 billion committed to Pakistan (East and West),
V4 se Pakistan received about 72 percent. During its long association
wit-.: Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the
economy. Until 1972, 38 percent of the total commitments were for the
public services, 29 percent for agriculture, 22 percent for industry,
10 percent for industrial imports, aid 1 percent for education. Lending
fLor nublic services amBunted to some US$325 million and included loans
anid credits  o railwa-ys, electric power, pipelines, the Karachi Port,
high.ways, telecorzunications and water supplies. A large part of the
lending for agriculturo was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for
industry has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation (PTCIC). Annex II contains a s-zrmnary statement
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of December 31, 1973, and notes on the
executiorn of ongoing projects.
14.       N.o Barnk loans or IDA credits were made for Pakistan between
Auggust 197C and October 1972, when a US$50 million credit for industrial
fizports was signed. Two credits were approved in FY 73, a second program
credit of US$45 ndllion for industrial imports and a US$18 million credit
for the excansion of Karachi Port.  In the current fiscal year, a Bank
loan of USS2J5 million for industrial investment, to be administered by
PICIC, has already been made. A credit for the provision of an oil
terminal for the port of Karachi and a loan of US$35 million for a
fertilizer project are in course of preparation and will be presented to
the Executive Directors shortly.  A project for telecammunications is
under consideration, and projects for highway improvement, for the
expansion of the natural gas transmission system and for seed multi-
plication are being prepared.  An economic mission was in Pakistan in
November 1973; one of its objectives was to study the steps needed to
encoulwge a program of rural development.  The mission's report is bDeing
finaliz3ed.  Another mission to review the water resources development
program is now in Pakistan.  As a result of this mission's work, projects
in the field of saliniy control and reclamation should be developed.
15.        Including undisbursed balances, Pakistan 's debt to the Bank
and IDA now represents about 22 percent of its external indebtedness;
'oy 1980 th-is ratio migrt increase to about 24 percent.  The share of
the Bank Group ir total debt service is now about 17 percent and is
expected to decrease to 10 percent by 1980.

PAR?T III - THt FLWOD OF AUGUST 1973 AND
ITS EFFECT ON∂HE ECONOI4Y
17.       In August 1973, there was a serious flood in Pakistan for the
first time in 13 years. The long period during which there had been no
floods itself contributed in some degree to the severity of the damage
which resulted. The relatively low flows of recent years led to an
accumulation of silt and hence a reduction in the capacity of the river
channels, the maintenance of the earthen levees or "bunds" suffered and
the staff of the provincial irrigation departments lacked recent experi-
ence in dealing with flood emergencies.
18.      Trhe heavy monsoon rains caused breaches in the bunds at ten
places in the Punjab which caused winespread inundation and severe
damage. The flooding in Punjab did, however, reduce the flow into the
lower Indus in Sind; conseauently, although the bun%as inthe Sind were
strained to the limit, only three breaches occurred and a major catas-
trophe was avoided. The flood surge passed to the sea during the first
week of September but the damage it left behind was greater than that
of any flood in the Indus basin for the last century.
19.       Altogether some 10 million acres were inundated, of which 4
million were under crops. Nearly ten thousand villages were flooded,
about 5 million people were affected, and about 500 lost their lives.
The major physical damage (other than the crop losses) was to the flood
protection ana irrigation works, to the transport network, particularly
the roads, and to private dwellings and public buildings. There was
also some damage to the power and telecommunications systems and to
industrial plants. In the immediate aftermath of this flood, the Goverm-
ment's first concern was the rescue andi evacuation of the population.
This operation was carried through with conspicuous success. In Sind,
under the direction of the Irrigation Department, the Army and local
leadership, enormous labor forces were rapidly mobilized to prevent
breaching of vital bunds. This collective effort, in which Central and
Provincial Government Ministers, senior officials, high-ranking officers
and manr Aray units, as wall as thousands of villagers took part, was
remarkably successful. After the flood, the affected communities spon-
taneously started to restore housing and essential facilities. Govern-
ment authorities immediately put in hand temporary repairs to the canals
irrigating rice and other Kharif crops. Within a month, irrigation
supplies were resumed to most of these areas, and public tubewells were
also rapidly repaired. The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)
restored the electric power supply to most areas within a few days. Rail-
way services between Karachi and the North were partially maintained by
promptly opening a new branch line on the western bank of the Indus.
US AID provided aircraft to transport fuel and essential cargo from
Karachi to the north, and emergency repairs were quickly carried out to
close breaches in railway lines and main roads. Telecommunications be-
tween major cities were partly restored after about a month.



- 6 -
20.       The e>fect of -ihe damage to different tyves of assets on the
eco-omy as a waol6 va-ies considerably.   For example, the damage to the
railway is stat_sticaly not very great, but it could have very
delaterious effects on the economy; for this reason, railway reconstruc-
tion was accordad the highest priority. Similarly, the repair
of the irrigation system(IUS$18 million equivalent) is not a major
iTem in the total damage bill but it is essential to carry it out in
order to avoid serious floods at tho next high water. On the other
hand, the value of dwelling houses destroyed is much greater and is
estimated at roughly US$90 million but the full replacement of these
assets will take time.
21.       The destruction of agricultural crops forms much the greatest
par-t of the total losses due to the flood. The total value of the
crops destroyed, both standing and in storage, valued at current prices
(as of December 1973) is estimated to be US$475 million, of which
US$160 million represents standing cotton and US$130 million grain in
storage, arid the remainder other crops. However, the heavy rains which
caused the flood also benefited crops in the nonflood areas. A
comprehensive aerial pesticide spraying program for rice was under-
taken, with U.S. assistance, in response to the flood and considerably
increased rice yields. Moreover, the export price of cotton is rising
so that despite the heavy damage to this crop, the foreign exchange
earnings in the current year from cotton and cotton products may well
be higher than last year. As. a consequence of these offsetting factors,
the net reduction in the value of major crops from last year's output
may be only US$150 million.
22.       In principle, the total effect of the flood on the economy
would be measured by the net reduction in the gross domestic output
caused by the flood, after taking account of the countermeasures taken
by the Government, the efforts of the people themselves, and the addi-
tional assistance provided from foreign sources. Wihile it might be
possible to make such a calculation when the statistics for the current
year are kr.own, it is not possible to make any reliable estimate at
the moment.  However, some rough estimates have been made of the effect
of the flood on the budget and the balance of paymnents.
23.       The flood both reduced the expected budget revenue for the
current year, largely because of reduced receipts from export taxes,
arid increased expenditures, largely because of increased subsidies on
imported wneat and edible oils.   The combined effect amounts to about
US$23L 4  illi on equ`valent.  However, the Goverrnent reacted to this
situation by imposing additional taxes which are expected to bring in
abou- US$89 million equivalent, thus reducing the adverse effect of
the flood to some US$1l5 million equivalent.
24.        Tcie flood will "reduce exports and increase imports.  The
reduction in potential exoorts is wholly on account of the reduction
in raw cotton exoports, which is expected to be about 100,000 tons of
lint cotwor, valued at US$lhO million. As against this, exports of rice



-7-
should be about US$40 million greater as a result of the good rains
in the rice-growing areas and the aerial spraying campaign. Hence,
the loss of exports due to the flood will probably be about US$'00
million.
25.        The increase of imports made necessary by the flood is less
easy to estimate. The best estimate of merchandise imports for
l973/74 is US$1,400 million, which is US$00 million more than the
pre-flood estimate. However, probably not all of this US$400 million
is attributable to the flood; the best estimate of the increase due to
the flood alone would be around US$200 million. Hence, the total im-
pact of the flood on the balance of payments, in the form of reduced
exports and increased imports combined, is likely to be in the order of
US$300 million.
26.        It is fortunate for Pakistan that the flood came at a time
when the balance of payments was fairly strong and improving. Despite
the flood, it is expected that the trade deficit this year may not
exceed US$300 million. Including invisibles and debt service, the
balance of payments deficit is estimated at US$535 million.   To fill
this gap, the expected capital inflow, including the foreign-aid
obtained in response to the flood, and including the proceeds of the
proposed credit, is likely to be US$475 million, leaving a residual gap
of US$60 million to be met from foreign exchange reserves.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED CREDIT
27.        As soon as the flood occurred, the Government organized
relief and reconstruction measures and requested international assist-
ance for rehabilitation. On September 17, 1973, the UN Economic and
Social Council requested the Secretary-General to invite the UNDP and
the specialized agencies to provide all possible assistance to Pakistan.
To this end, the UN asked the Bank and other specialized agencies to
collaborate with it in a mission to survey the damage and to consider
recommendations for assistance. When the Bank received this request
on September 21, it had already decided, in consultation with the
Pakistan authorities, to send a small mission to Pakistan under the
direction of Mr. Bernard Chadenet, Vice-President of the Baink. It was,
therefore, agreed that the UN and the Bank would collaborate in a joint
mission under the joint direction of Dr. Victor Umbricht, Special
Representative of the Secretary-General, and Mr. Chadenet.
28.        The joint mission was in Pakistan in October for two and a
half weeks.  It held numerous discussions with officials of the Central
Govermnent in Islamabad, the Punjab Government in Lahore and the Sind
Government in Karachi. It visited flood-affected areas in Punjab and
Sind Provinces and discussed the problens with local officials and
villagers. The mission was impressed to find that the areas had become
veritable hives of activity. Work was proceeding simultaneously on



-8-
t-.e repair o- essential facilities such as canals, railways, roads and
bridges, trne rehabilitation of buildings and the preparation of the
land for the wi-nter crop.  At the same time, it was clear that the
flood had caused severe hardship for large numbers of people who lost
their homes, possessions, crops, and, in some cases, even their land.
29.        The TUN Report of the joint mission was circulated to Execu-
tive Directors on November 29 (Sec M73-716). The IBRD report, on which
the proposal for the present credit is based, is being circulated to
Executive Directors separately (304a-PAK). Negotiations for the pro-
posed credit took place in mid-January. The Borrower was represented
by Mr. M.L.K. Khalil, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Planning
and Development, Mr. M.Q. Siddiqi, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Fuel,
Power and Natural Resources, and Mr. A.M. Mufti, Economic Minister,
Embassy of Pakistan. A credit summary is attached as Annex III.
30.        The flood had an immediate effect in the form of the destruc-
tion of, or damage to, capital assets, and a longer-term effect in the
form of the reduction in national output resulting from the damage to
capital assets. External assistance can therefore be of most benefit
to the economy if it can both help directly to repair the flood damage
before the next high water season and, at the same time, help to miti-
gate or offset the longer-term economic effects of the flood.  The IDA
credit now proposed would contribute to both objectives. Pakistan has
also received external aid from governmental sources, from the UN
system and from international voluntary agencies which, by the end of
October 1973, amounted to US$60 million equivalent in cash and materials.
Some of the items included in this aid are closely related to the pro-
posed credit. For example, the U.S. is considering financing spare
parts in an amount of some US$4 million for earthmoving and related
equipment previously supplied by U.S. companies.  Canada has contributed
C$l million to replace electrical equipment and has agreed to finance
railway locomotives and spare parts (C$l million).
31.        Most of the work involved in re-pairing the flood damage con-
sists of a large number of fairly small items, for example, the
replacement of tubewells and farm equipment, and all the work involved
in rehabilitating villages, including private dwellings. The most
important single item which is suitable for Bank Group assistance is
the repair of the river bu:nds, canals and roads. The bunds must be
repaired and strengthened by the time of the next high water in August
1974 or else there will be another flood. It is estimated that this
work will cost approximately Rs 223 million or US$22.6 million equiva-
ierr. and thle credit would provide US$11.8 rillion to assist with this
work.
Description of the Credit
32.        The it`ms directly related to flood damage which would be
LiLnancec under the credit would be:



(a)  The restoration of damaged flood bunds, canals, drains
and roads by the Irrigation and Roads Departments of
the Punjab and Sind Governments   (US$9.9 million.)
(b)  The reconstruction of about 16 miles of damaged flood
bund in Sind which will be carried out by a mechanized
task force of the international contractor, Tarbela
Joint Venture (TJV). (US$1.9 million.)
(c)  Technical assistance for a technical review of the
flood prediction, warning and protection systems in
the Indus basin. (US$0.2 million.)
(d)  Spare parts for agricultural tractors and for farm
machinery and agricultural implements. (US$2 million.)
(e)  Spare parts, replacement equipment and materials for
tubewells. (US$0.7 million.)
(f)  Spare parts for government construction machinery and
equipment. (US$0.3 million.)
(g)  Replacements for meteorological equipment and associated
communications network equipment and spare parts.
(US$0.1 million.)
(h)  Power drilling rigs for re-drilling tubewells, including
vehicles, equipment, materials and spare parts.
(US$0.9 million.)
The total amount of the credit to be used for these purposes would be
US$16 million equivalent.
33.        In addition to providing assistance for the direct rehabili-
tation of the physical assets damaged by the flood, the credit would
provide US$18 million for the purchase of a wide range of imports
substantially the same as those purchased under the credits for indus-
trial imports made in 1972 and 1973. These imports include industrial
raw materials and intermediate goods, tools and implements, some
machinery and equipment, commercial and industrial vehicles and fertilizer.
A complete list of items is contained in Annex III. This part of the
credit would help to offset the deterioration in the balance of payments
resulting from the flood. The counterpart in rupees of the foreign
exchange disbursed under this part of the credit would accrue to the
Government and would serve to offset in some measure the adverse effect
of the flood on the current budget. Thus the credit would serve to
assist Pakistan to deal with both the direct and the indirect conse-
quences of the flood. The unallocated portion of the credit is $1 million.
Organization and Supervision
34.        In order to coordinate the rehabilitation of the flood damage,
the Government has established a Coordinating Group consisting of repre-
sentatives of the central and provincial ministries and departments



- 10 -
concerned with the work. This Coordinating Group would review construc-
tion schedules, the progress of works, the availability of equipment
and progress of rehabilitating unlserviceable equipment with new spare
parts. It would also review the availability of funds required by the
central and provincial government agencies for the timely completion of
the work.
35.        The rehabilitation of the river bunds and other civil works
would be the responsibility of the Provincial Governments of the Punjab
and Sind. A 16-mile section of the bund on the left bank of the Indus
in Sind will be carried out under contract by TJV, the international
contracting group which has been engaged in the construction of the
Tarbela Dam on the Indus River. The Government of Sind intends to
entrust the supervision of this work to Planning and Development Con-
sultants of Karachi. For the balance of the civil works, Provincial
Government engineering departments will use their own forces. Sir
Alexander Gibb and Partners would be employed by the Association to
carry out supervision functions on behalf of the Associaticn with
regard to all civil works to be carried out by TJV and the Provincial
Government forces. They would perform functions similar to those which
they have carried out in connection with the Indus and Tarbela Dam
Projects; the cost of these additional services would be TUS$409,000.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.        The Tarbela Joint Venture is the only commercial firm in
Pakistan with sufficient capacity to carry out the repair work to the
16 m:les of damaged flood protective bund in Sind in the time available
before the next monsoon. The credit would cover the foreign exchange
cost of the contract for this work negotiated between the Government
of Sind and TJV. The remaining civil works in Punjab and Sind will be
carried out by the Provincial Governments, using their own labor and
equipment and some equipment hired from Central Government agencies.
The credit would meet 50 percent of the total expenditures, estimated at
US$19.8 million equivalent, by the Provincial authorities for this pur-
pose;this would involve financing of local expenditures, amounting to
perhaps US$5 to 6 million equivalent.
37.        Because of the need to complete the bund repair work by
July 197h, the Government began to work as soon as it could. In order to
help finance the work which has already been done, the portion of the
credit to be used for this purpose would include retroactive financing of
expenditures made since August 16, 1973, up to a limit of US$4 million.
38.        The spare parts for tractors and agricultural machinery and
the replacement items for tubewells, and meteorological equipment would
be proprietary items for existing installations, and international
competitive bidding would not therefore be practical. In the interests
of standardization and in order to place contracts for the $900,000
worth of drilling rigs as rapidly as possible, it is proposed to waive
international competitive bidding for these items, which would be pro-
cured directly. Disbursement would be on the basis of the c.i.f. cost
of these items.



39.        The US$18 million of industrial imports to be purchased under
the proposed credit would be predominantly direct imports by private
firms through normal commercial channels. The Trading Corporation of
Pakistan (TCP), a state corporation, is the designated importer of a
limited number of items on which economies can be secured by importing
in bulk. The Government has agreed that goods procured by TCP out of the
proposed credit under contracts costing US$100,000 or more would be pro-
cured on the basis of international competition. Disbursement of this
part of the credit would be on the basis of reimbursement for the c.i.f.
cost of qualifying imports. The State Bank of Pakistan would be respons-
ible for collecting, through nominated banks, invoices, evidence of ship-
ment and evidence that the supplier has received payment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUHENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan and the International Development Association, the
Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d)
of the Articles bf Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. In view of the fact that restoration of civil
works damaged by the floods is to be carried out by the Provinces of
Punjab and Sind, the Development Credit Agreement makes it a condition
of effectiveness that Pakistan and the provinces shall have made
arrangements satisfactory to the Association for the carrying out of
these works. The terms and conditions for these arrangements are set
out in Schedule 4 to the Development Credit Agreement.
41.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.        In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to
take full account of the recent increases in petroleum prices. How-
ever, available information indicates that the proposed credit remains
fully justified.
43.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed Credit.

C. Projects in Execution /
Loan No. 266       Incdus Basin: US $90 Million Loan of September 19,
1960; Closing Date: December .1, 127
All major project items (except Tarbela Dam) have been completed.
Some minor remedial works have still to be finished and settlement remains
to be made on a number of claims. Further disbursement of this Loan (main-
ly for Tarbela Dam), which was interrupted in 1971 by agreement with the
United States in order to disburse first the loan contribution of the United
States to the Indus Basin Development Fund, has now resumed. Work on the
Tarbela Dam project is proceeding on schedule. The original Closing Date
of September 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 5O         Education: US ;8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Closing Date: June 30. lO72
The project suffered initial delays due to administrative
difficulties, shortages of building materials, lack of local funds, the
1971 war and, more recently, extensive floods. The pace of implementation
has improved but problems of equipment procurement and shortages of building
materials remain. All construction contracts have been awarded, of which
about 76 percent are completed. Equipment installed at the agricultural
university represents about 80 percent of the total allocation and at the
technical institutes, 90 percent of the total allocated.  The project is
expected to be completed by the new Closing Date.
Loan No. 376       Karachi Port: US $17.0 Million Loan of May 14. 196;
Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The execution of this project has been delayed substantially. The
total cost of the project has increased from the original estimate ol US $37.5
million to US $47.0 million but there has been no charnge in the foreign ex-
change component of US $17.0 million. This increase has not materially af-
fected the economic justification of the project. The project was first
delayed by difficulties withthe original design of the wharves. In 1967-
work had to be suspended and the wharves redesigned. Later, it was found
that more extensive soil investigation was necessary, which meant further
delay. The war in 1971 and labor troubles also contributed to the delay.
The difficulties now appear to have been brought under control and the
works are now approaching completion. The dredging operations, although
more than 90 percent complete, are still behind schedule but are now being
expedited. The original Closing Date of March 31, 1969, was extended first
to June 30, 1972, and then to June 30, 1974, the current date.
2/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not p_--port to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan Nio. 548      Tarbela Dam; US $25.0 Million Loan of July 10
'968; Crlosing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and no disburse-
ments are exmected until FY1976. Good progress is being maintained on
the project. On September 29, 1973, the Indus ,Rver was diverted through
tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage - the construction of the
closure section of the dam - to be undertaken. The main civil works con-
tractors have submitted suostantial claims on accoant of labor costs, in-

by a special Government committee.
Cr. No. i45        Telecommunications; US $16.0 Million Credit of
March 6, 1969; Closing aata: December 31, 19T
Cr. No. 186        Telecommunications; US $15.0 Million, Credit of
May 22, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
There have been delays in implementing both these credits.
The original proposals allowed for the expenditure under the two credits
of about US $11.3 million in the former East Wing and U3 $19.7 million
in the West. US $5.2 million of the undisbursed balance of Credit 15-PAK
was cancelled in November 1972 after a telecommunications project to
Bangladesh was approved. The Closing Date of 14;5-PAK was extended from
the original date of December 31, 1972 to December 31, 1974. The Closing
Date of Credit 186-PAK has been extended from December 31, 1973 to
December 31, 1975; and the credit proceeds are reallocated to reflect the
increased costs of imports resulting from the realingnent of curren-
cies. This will also allow GOP more time for the reorganization of the
Pakistan Telephone and Telegraph Department, the introduction of an effec-
tive accounting system and the completion of the installation of equip-
ment under the Credits.
Loan No. 590       Development Finance Company - PICIC; U5 $40.0
Million Loan of March 21, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1975
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 197T, has been extended to September 30, 1975, to enable
disbursements to be made for the last subproject.
Loan No. 621       Railways; US $l4.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) rehabilitation and improvement of workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. However, the proposal for the expansion of the marshalling
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first phase of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead. The change was based on a
feasibility study conducted by consultants (SOFRERAIL, France), who indicated
that a new yard at Pinri would be economically and ooerati-na1ly preferable.

The original Closing Date of December 31, 1972, has been extended by
three years to December 31, 1975, to allow time for Pipri yard to be
built and the balance of the loan has been reallocated.   PWR has also
reappointed the consultants for a period of 18 months.
Cr. No. 157     Agricultural Development Bank: US$30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Closing Date: June 30,
197 
Disbursements under this Credit are very much behind the
original schedule. Delays in issuing import licenses and slowness in
lending for tubewells because of difficulties in providing electrical
connections were originally responsible for this delay.   The original
Closing Date of June 30, 1972, has been extended to June 30, 197T.
Cr. No. 177     Development Finance Company - IDBP: US$20.0 Mil-
lion Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Although IDBP has restored its organizational effectiveness,
the loss of the former East Pakistan had far-reaching repercussions on
its financial position. Pending a satisfactory solution of this problem,
and to enable IDBP to resume lending to industry, the unwithdrawn amount
of the credit has been converted into a government owned fund administered
by IDBP as an agent of the Government. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 197t4 has been postponed to December 31, 1977.
Loan No. 696      Gas Transmission: US$19.2 Million Loan of June 29,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The 1971 war has delayed execution of this project and also
caused a small increase in its cost (less than 3%).   The project was sub-
stantially completed in July 1973, but to enable disbursements to be
made for retention payments and some equipment procurement, the original
"losing Date of June 30, 1973, has been extended to December 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 206     Engineering Education: US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Construction of the College is expected to start early in
1974. Civil works and equipment procurement will probably be completed
before the closing date but the staff development program has been slow
to start and may extend beyond that time.   The cost of the civil works
is expected to increase from Ra 16 million to Rs 31 million. But due
to the devaluation of the ruipee, the credit amount will be sufficient to
meet IDA's share of this increase.   However, the Government will need to
provide an additional Rs 6.7 million to make up its share.

Million Credit of AuXt   24 170; Closing Date:
December 317 1975
Implementation of the project is now proceeding much more
satisfactorily.  Contracts to the value of about US $17.0 million
equivalent have been placed. Orders for remaining equipment are ex-
pected to be placed soon. The first consignments of equipment are
beginning to arrive in Pakistan. Some difficulty has been experienced
in acquiring the necessary sites for substations and the delivery
of six 30MVA transformers has bad to be delayed. WAPDA is making every
effort to speed up acquisition proceedings. As of January 31, 1974
US $3.18 million had been disbursed. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1974 has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
