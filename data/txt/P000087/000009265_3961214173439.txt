IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT NO. 1960-BEN
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the
Telecommunications Project in Benin. for which Credit 1960-BEN in the amount of
SDR 12.5 million (US$16.0 million equivalent) was approved on November 8, 1988
and made effective on November I1, 1989.
The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995, compared with the original closing
date of December 31, 1993. Final disbursement took place on September 30, 1995, the
credit being fully disbursed. Cofinancing for the Project was provided by AfDB, CFD,
CIDA, EIB and FAC.
The ICR was prepared by Silvano Monti and Svetoslav Tintchev of the
Telecommunications and Informatics Division and reviewed by Mary Oakes Smith,
Chief, Industry and Energy Division (AF41E); Paul Bermingham, Public Enterprises
Specialist (AF4IE', and Franz Kaps, Operations Adviser (AF4DR). The Borrower
provided comments that are included as an appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision
mission, in October 1994. It is based on material in the project file. The borrower
contributed to preparation of the ICR by contributing views reflected in the mission's
aide-memoire and preparing its own evaluation of the Project's execution.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
TELECOMMIUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT NO. 1960-BEN
Evaluation Summary
Background
1.       Prior to the First Telecommunication Project (Credit 1-960-BEN), the Bank had no
previous experience in the sector in Benin. The development and operation of the sector were
severely constrained, lacking financial resources and adequate institutional capacity. The
Government of the Republic of Benin (GOB) first requested IDA assistance in 1982 to finance
investment in local networks in the main cities. An IDA sector report in 1983 stressed that the
very poor state of telecommunications constituted a major bottleneck to economic and social
development in the country and that the operating entity, the Office des Postes et
Telecommunications du Benin (OPTB), was ineffective due to manpower, organizational and
financial constraints. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF) was approved by IDA in 1984 and
expanded twice in 1987 and 1988. Project preparation was coordinated with other potential
donors.
2.       OPTB had been established in 1959 as an "Etablissement Public a  Caractere
Industriel et Commercial" (EPIC) under the guidance and supervision of the Ministry of
Culture and Communications (MCC), in a monopolistic environment deriving from its previous
organization as a Government Department. Under the PPF, OPTB designed a mediurn tern
development program (1988-92) and, with help from ITU, a National Maintenance
Improvement Plan (PNAM). Action plans were also prepared to improve OPTB's organization,
financial management and operational capability. Several other development financing agencies
(AfDB, CFD, CIDA, EIB and FAC) were approached to contribute to the financing of the
proposed program. The projeUt was appraised by IDA in 1988.
Project Objectives and Description
3.       The primary sector objectives set up by GOB  specifically addressed the
modernization and expansion   of the country's telecommunications infrastructure, the
improvement of the quality of service, and improvements in the organizational and financial
performance of OPTB. This would enable satisfying demand and creating a financial flow from
the sector. In the context of the GOB structural adjustment program to improve public resource
management and investment programming, the project was designed consistent with the then
traditional approach to the development of public utilities.



ii
4.       The first telecommunications project in Benin, supported by SDR 12.5 million (US
$16.0 million equivalent), (IDA Credit 1960-BEN) has been implemented by OPTB. To meet
the above main sector objectives, the project comprised: (a) rehabilitation, replacement and
extension of local line and switching installations in Cotonou and Porto Novo to meet demand
in the year 2000, i.e., 34,000 lines; (b) selected upgrading of the trunk transmission network;
(c) installation of rural telecommunications systems; and (d) technical assistance and training
for improvement and strengthening of management and organization, planning and project
execution, technical operation and maintenance, commercial and administrative management,
and manpower development.
Project Achievements and Results
5.       Implementation Schedule and Costs.  The IDA financed project components for
local line networks were implemented on schedule, construction beginning in 1990 and being
completed in 1994. Large increases in new connected lines to meet the forecast number of
20,500 connected DELs in service was initially delayed due to late effectiveness of the
financing from other donors for ,witching equipment. However, larger installed capacities
enabled OPTB to outperform the forecast (25,000 DELs in 1995). The cost of the project,
estimated to be US$65.3 million at appraisal - with IDA contributing US$16.0 million - was
actually US$61.7 million at completion. The cost reductions stemmed from lower costs of
switching and transmission components. This resulted from international competition under
Bank ICB procedures and technological development in the industry during the project period.
6.       Physical Results.  The primary objectives of expansion and modernization of the
networks were fully met and somewhat exceeded. By end 1993, installed switching capacity
was 35,700 lines, compared to the SAR objective of 31,000, and capacities were expected to
increase up to 38,000 at the end of 1995. Most of expansion was carried out using modem
equipment. Service quality greatly improved but some targets (faults per line per year and call
completion rates) will only be met during 1996 when all new installations are in service.
7.       Operational and Financial Results.   Operational and production targets for
telecommunications were met with regard to staff productivity (75 versus 85 staff per 1,000 lines
in 1995 in the SAR), operating costs per line (CFA franc 150,000 compared to CFA franc
181,000 in 1993 in the SAR) and marketing/quality of services. Financial targets, however,
were only partially fulfilled, due in particular to: (a) the devaluation of the CFAF in 1994; (b)
the late completion of separate accounting systems for postal and telecommunications activities
and the related introduction of a reliable integrated accounting system; and (c) the non-timely
payments of its usage of OPTB's services by GOB. The Government is about one year late in
its payment for telecommunications services.
8.       Institutional Development. The institutional objectives of the project were restricted
to the domain of the operating entity - OPTB was to change and improve its organization and
its management. These objectives were broadly met, OPTB reorganized and strengthened its
internal structure and made steps to prepare the future autonomy of its telecommunications,



iii
postal and financial (savings bank) activities.  These improvements and the respective
obligations of GOB and OPTB were undertaken and monitored within a Performance Contract
(1992-1994) which was largely complied with, although some of the important proposed
institutional and management measures (statute of personnel, integrated accounting system,
implementation of tariff study recommendations, managerial and financial separation of
postal/telecommunications activities, etc.) remain to materialize.
9.       During the implementation period, a constructive dialogue started between the Bank
and the sector authorities and led toward consideration of a new policy approach to the sector
issues and the determination of sector policy and sector reform objectives in line with the
current worldwide trends, telecommunications moving away from the piublic sector to private
investment and competition. Discussions are being held with GOB in this field, and within the
framework of the Assistance to Enterprises Project in Benin (Credit 1748-BEN), with a view to
initiate in-depth restructuring of the Posts and Telecommunications Sector in Benin.
10.      The economic rate of return was calculated at 18% compared to 20% in the SAR.
11.      Compliance with legal covenants was generally satisfactory. Cases of partial or
delayed compliance include the level of accounts receivable from the Government, the rate of
return on assets of less than 10% following the 1994 devaluation, and delays in receiving
audited accounts.
12.      The performance of both the Borrower and the Bank in implementing the project
was generally satisfactory.
Major Factors Affecting the Project
Project Sustainability
13.      Most of the physical, operational, institutional, and financial objectives under the
project have been achieved and some of them have been exceeded. The project benefits are
significant, including: (a) increase in the quality and coverage to the telecommunications
services; (b) transformation of OPTB from a Government agency into a more commercially
oriented entity; (c) the organizational split between post and telecoms activities as a preparation
of future separation; and (d) the increased awareness of GOB on the need to further adapt the
regulatory framework and to involve private sector in the provisional telecoms services. The
project also contributed to establishing a good logistic base to sustain an adequate maintenance
and operation of the provided installations, and to ensure the efficiency of the operating entity,
thus adequately serving the customers. Inspite of temporarily less favorable financial results in
1994, OPTB should be able to satisfactorily operate the new facilities in the future, and to
contribute to the financing of the required additional expansion.
14.      These are favorable conditions for the project sustainability and the continuation
through the life period of the new facilities of their support to the country's economy. Beyond



iv
the satisfactory results from the project, however, there is a need for more in-depth sector policy
and management reform, to promote competition and increase private participation, together
with the establishment of adequate regulatory institutions. GOB is currently more aware of the
need and prepares to take the necessary steps to further improve sector structure and
organization.
Assessment of Outcome
15.      The overall project outcome is satisfactory. The project exceeded some of its
physical objectives and achieved most of the institutional and financial objectives.
Key Findings, Future Operation, and Lessons Learned
16.       The key findings and lessons learned are:
(a)    project implementation has been facilitated by the continuity of Bank staff
assigned to it and a sustained consultation and coordination of activities between
OPTB and the involved donors;
(b)   the full realization of the institutional and financial objectives of the project
would have required the involvement of GOB's authorities during project
implementation, in particular in the field of staff statute, establishment of clearly
integrated accounting and financial procedures, and Government arrears for
Telecommunications services; and
(c)    In-depth sector reform  and restructuring of public utilities type sectors
traditionally operated in a monopolistic environment, such as posts and
telecoms, is a difficult, complex and slow  process.  The dialogue and
consultation process initiated under the project between the interested parties on
the side of the Government and donors will help to work out appropriate ways
and means for the suitable changes.  This advocates for continued IDA
involvement to encourage and support public sector and enterprise reforn in
Benin, in particular with regard for telecommunications.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF BENIN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
CREDIT NO. 1960-BEN
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background and Project Objectives
I.       The first telecommunications project in Benin, which was supported by IDA
Credit 1960-BEN in the amount of SDR 12.5 million (US$16.0 million equivalent), was
implemented by the Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Benin (OPTB). OPTB
was established by decree in 1959 and was modified in 1971 as an "etablissement public
a caractere industriel et commercial" (EPIC). The National Savings Bank (CNE), which
has responsibility for postal savings, has a separate statute but is managed by OPTB.
OPTB is operating under the policy guidance of the Ministry of Culture and
Communications. Prior to the start of the project, the telecommunications sector in Benin
was severely constrained by lack of financial resources and adequate institutional
capacity to develcp and operate the system and to provide satisfactory service. The sector
was characterized by chronic underinvestment resulting in a slow growth (5 percent per
annum on average from 1980 to 1987), low telephone penetration (an average of 0.3
DELs per 100 population in 1987, and only 1.4 per 100 in Cotonou), large unsatisfied
expressed demand (60 percent of demand met), traffic congestion particularly in long
distance and international services (call completion rate of only about 30 percent) and
reduced service reliability due to obsolete facilities.
2.       The primary sector objectives set up by the Government of Benin at the onset
of the project specifically addressed the modernization and expansion of the country's
telecommunications infrastructure and the improvement of the quality of service and
financial situation of the sector. To meet these primary sector objectives, OPTB designed
a medium term development program for priority works for the period 1988 to 1992,
which included a significant component for local network rehabilitation and expansion.
Over the period, the number of subscribers would increase from 12,800 to 18,700. A
National Maintenance Improvement Plan (PNAM) was started with the help of ITU. In
order to redress the financial situation, an action plan was adopted to improve the
financial management and in particular to increase the rate of collection of
telecommunications bills; a program of financial restructuring was carried out, resulting
in the reconstitution of customer deposits in the postal bank (CCP) and the savings bank
(CNE).
3.       The project was designed in 1988 in a monopolistic environment. The policy
objectives did not address the liberalization of the sector, the introduction of competition,



2
or active participation of the private sector in development and operations. The project
concept was consistent with the traditional approach to public utilities which prevailed at
that time. All institutional objectives were concentrated on relieving organizational,
management and financial constraints existing within OPTB. However, during the
implementation period, a constructive dialogue started between the Bank and the sector
authorities and led toward a new policy approach to the sector issues and the
determination of sector policy objectives in line with the current worldwide trends.
4.        A comprehensive program of technical assistance to OPTB amounting to 370
staff months and including training and computer equipment, was included in the project
with the specific objectives of: (a) providing assistance for supervision of main works
and subscribers installation; (b) improving the entity overall management and
organization; (c) streamlining management and organization; (d) improving financial
management to cover financial audit, financial projections, budget and treasury
management and tariff studies; (e) introducing commercial management, including
billing and collection, stocks, planning and subscriber management; (f) reviewing
staffing requirements, recruitment, and promotion policies; (g; carrying out a
comprehensive staff training program; (h) improving management of postal and financial
services; (i) preparing computerization of operations and; (j) developing a management
information system. An action plan and time schedule for implementation of this
technical assistance was prepared in consultation with the Bank.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives.
Institutional Development
5.        Institutional Objectives. In the framework of this project, the institutional
objectives focused on the operating entity: they included changes in OPTB's statutes and
organization and improvements in its management.
6.        Organization. Supported by consultants' studies, OPTB's internal structure
was reorganized and a new organization chart was established in 1990 to prepare for the
future start of postal and telecommunications activities. Post and Telecommunications
directorates were created with distinct divisions for budget, procurement and human
resources management.  The savings bank (CNE) is a separate directorate. Some
activities are still managed by a Common Services Directorate (computer services, stores,
vehicles and building management); the finance and accounting function flow has not
been separated. In this respect, the organizational aspects of the institutional objectives as
designed at project appraisal were generally satisfactory.
7.        Management. Management improvements have been implemented by
establishing operation and marketing divisions in charge of billing, collection and
customer relations, U~pclational divisions in charge of supervision of network
development, subscriber connection and fault repair. A marketing division was



3
established in the postal directorate as well. The human resources divisions have
established job descriptions for all management positions and carried out a staffing need
study.
Performance Contract
8.        GOB and OPTB undertook to perform their respective obligations under a
performance contract. The first contract was signed for the period 1992-1994.
OPTB 's obligations
9.       Institutional reform. GOB decided in 1993 to change the statute of OPTB's
staff from the civil service. A new statute is being discussed with union representatives
but is not yet implemented.
10.      Management. Reliability of accounting has improved through an integrated
accounting system. However, it was not completed by the end of the project. Personnel
and fixed assets auxiliary accounts are computerized and linked with general accounting,
but cash and investment projects management and long term debt are not, and links with
general accounting are not yet secure in the case of billing and collection, accounts
payable and inventory management. Computerization of accounting is proceeding
piecemeal, including for postal operations (they are not completed yet for postal checking
savings accounts, money orders and postal branches).
11.      Staff productivity. OPTB recruited no new staff in 1993 and 1994. The
optimal level of staffing has been recommended by consultants and would result in
downsizing of OPTB. The management of OPTB has not yet taken any decision in this
regard. During the project implementation, a training program for managers was carried
out and a training program for operation staff is under implementation.
12.      Financial management.  OPTB was able to present separate financial
statements for postal and telecommunications activities. A tariffs study was carried out
in 1994.
13.      Operational targets for telecommunications activities were met. The number
of staff per 1,000 lines is 76 as compared to a target of 78. Operating costs per line were
CFA franc 150,500 (equivalent US$300) in 1993, below the expected target of CFA franc
181,000. The number of service lines has been reduced to 923 (target 1,100) and the
corresponding volume of traffic has decreased by a factor of 20 percent since 1991. The
total number of paying lines has increased to 20,700 in 1993 compared to a target of
18,200 established for 1994.
14.      Marketing and quality of service targets for telecommunications have also
been met. Eighty five percent of demands are satisfied within 1 month. The fault ratio
per line per annum (12 percent in 1993) and the percentage of faults repaired within 48



4
hours (78 percent) are above the contract targets.  Eighty-five percent of bills are
recovered within 4 months and 87.5 percent within one year.  These results are
considered satisfactory.
15.      Postal activities. Targets have been partially met. Revenues from mail
services amount to CFA franc 455 million in 1993 (target CFA franc 430 million for
1994). CFA franc 2.6 billion have been collected in CNE accounts compared to an
objective of CFA franc 1.8 billion. Operation of checking accounts (CCP) is fully
computerized by the end of 1994 and should be achieved in 1995 for savings accounts
(CNE). Results for percentage of mail delivered within 2 days in Cotonou is 80 percent,
below target of 95 percent.
16.      Financial targets. Financial targets for 1992 and 1993 have been fulfilled.
However, the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 caused a deterioration in financial
performance. The rate of return on telecommunications assets was 27 percent in 1993,
but dropped to 8 percent in 1994. The debt ratio of telecommunications increased from
1.1 in 1993 to 2.1 in 1994.
GOB's obligations
17.      Receivables from  GOB.  A major difficulty of the project was to get
ministries to pay their telephone bills as soon as they are due. In August 1994, the
Government had accumulated arrears equivalent to more than one year of consumption
(CFA franc 1 billion). A recommendation from the Council of Ministers (August 1994)
instructs the Ministry of Finance to pay in advance the amount of telephone bills. OPTB
and the Ministry of Finance's Budget Department are committed to enforce jointly the
1994 decision of the Council of Ministers..
18.      Monitoring by GOB. The Ministry in charge of sector supervision did not put
into place an effective monitoring of OPTB, based on periodic reviews of the
achievements of the performance contract, this was pointed out by the Bank's supervision
missions. It was also recommended to urgently prepare the following three years'
performance contract (1995-1997).
Financial Objectives
19.      Annual audit requirements. Audits of the OPTB accounts have been
performed for each year since 1989 under AfDB financing, by auditors of international
standing. Delays over the deadline set up by the Credit went up to nine months (1993
accounts).
20.      Accounting system. The reliability of the accounting system has improved
although an integrated accounting system was not completed by the end of the project.
The formal separation of post and telecommunications activities had not been completed



5
and the reorganization of the accounting department into two new units will require
hiring about ten qualified staff members.
21.       Billing and collection. Within the new 1990 organization which started the
separation of telecommunications and postal and financial services, a division was
created for telecommunications commercial operations, in charge of billing and collection
and marketing actions, and another for postal marketing operations. Billing is presently
every two months and it is envisaged to have it monthly for large subscribers and spread
the others into bi-monthly billing groups to improve cash management. A recovery rate
of about 90 percent after two years on private subscribers is satisfactory.
22.       Government receivable. One of the covenants of the Credit and one of the
Government's obligations in the three-year performance contract is to make timely
payments of its consumption of telecommunications services to OPTB. The Government
is about one year late in its payments.
23.       Budgets. Budget accounting (preparation and control for operation and
investment) has been active since the beginning of 1993, with only three accountable
categories, as was requested by a Credit covenant.
24.       Tariffs. A tariff study was concluded by consultants in November 1993. It
was updated in 1994 to take into account the 50 percent devaluation of the CFA franc.
OPTB applied the recommendations and increased monthly fixed charges and time based
tariffs by 25 percent. It also reduced the geographic districts from nine to four zones and
introduced time duration and day/night tariffs for local calls. International tariffs were
adjusted to have a slight excess of incoming traffic from Europe. The penalty for
reconnection has been sharply increased to make suspension more costly.
25.       Financial situation. Rates of return and self-financing ratios, as defined in the
Credit Agreement were satisfied from 1990 to 1992, but the January 1994 CFA franc
devaluation has deeply affected OPTB's financial position, as the provision for exchange
loss has to be spread over four years, starting in 1993. The dividend to the Government
will be reduced and OPTB expects to be exempted from profit taxes in 1995 and 1996.
However, in spite of the expected less favorable financial results in 1994, OPTB will be
able to contribute adequately to the financing of future investments.
26.       Postai services. Postal equilibrium could be achieved if the rate of savings
increased enough to reach the objectives defined in the performance contract.
Physical Objectives
27.      Implementation schedule. The massive increase in new subscriber lines
started at the beginning of 1993, as compared to SAR estimates of mid-1991. The delay
in implementation was about 18 months for Cotonou, (the local line plant was financed
under the Credit and was implemented on schedule), and was due to delays in the



6
effectiveness of loans from other cofinanciers (CFD, EIB, AfDB) related to other
components (switching, transmission). As for Porto Novo and Abomey, connection of
new subscribers began in mid-1 995.  The main reason for the delay is the late
effectiveness of the AfDB financing.
28.       Growth Objectives of the network. The objectives of expansion and
modernization of the network were exceeded (Part II, Table 5(a) and 5(b)). At the end of
1993, the capacity of the switching network was 35,724 lines, compared to the initial
objective of 30,850. The number of connected lines was 20,483 compared to an objective
of 20,550. The number of telex lines did not grow, in line with world wide trends. Most
of the expansion was carried out through the use of modem equipment (e.g. digital
switching, digital fiber optic links).
29.       Objectives of service quality. The expansion was accompanied by a complete
renovation of the outside plant network. As a result, faults rates have been reduced by a
factor of four in the Cotonou area and the average time for fault repair has been halved.
The situation is still not satisfactory (0.7 faults per line per annum) compared to
international standards. The technical call completion rate has greatly improved for local
calls but has remained very low for long distance calls.
Cost of the Project
30.       The cost of the project was estimated to be US$65.3 million at appraisal, with
the Bank contributing US$16.0 million (See Part II. Tables 8a and 8b). The actual cost of
the project was US$61.7 million. The cost reductions stem from the switching and
transmission components, although more lines were purchased than planned. This is the
result of international competition, following Bank procurement guidelines, as well as
overall industry technological developments. The cost per line is US$4,000 on average
and remains high in comparison with worldwide average of US$ 1,000 to US$2,000. This
is explained by the small size of the market, the high proportion of spare parts, training
and initial establishment cost of works.
Procurement
31.       The process of procurement was on schedule, due to excellent cooperation
between the Bank and OPTB and effective use of technical assistance.
Disbursements
32.       No particular difficulties and no delays were encountered in the disbursement
against applications for withdrawals made by OPTB in accordance with the Bank's
disbursement handbook. Cumulative estimated and actual disbursements, for each fiscal
year are shown in Part II, Table 4. OPTB asked for a six months extension of the closing
date (from December 31, 1994 to June 30, 1995) in order to finance the additional



7
technical assistance required for the supervision of the Porto Novo network which was
delayed under AfDB financing.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors not generally subject to Government control
33.       One important factor that positively affected the overall cost of the project is
the substantial reduction of international market prices for the high technology digital
switching and transmission equipment. In addition to lower costs, the new technology
systems provide better and more reliable services and require less maintenance. This has
a positive impact on staff productivity.
34.       The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 adversely affected the
financial position of OPTB as debt service, investments and some maintenance costs are
incurred in foreign currency.
Factors generally subject to Government control
35.       The statutes of OPTB staff are defined by civil service regulations and are
not adapted to recruiting the required specialists for a more commercially oriented
corporation. New statutes have been defined and discussed with staff representatives and
Government. The Government has yet to adopt these new statutes.
36.       As mentioned above, the performance of the Government in supervising
OPTB was weak. Achievement of targets was not subject to regular review and the new
performance contract to cover the 1995-1997 period has not yet finalized.
D. Project Sustainability
Project Benefits.
37.       The project benefits include: (a) an increase in the quality and coverage of
telecommunications services; (b) the transformation of OPTB from a Government agency
into a more commercially oriented . perating entity; (c) the organizational split between
post and telecommunications activities as a preparation of future separation; and (d) the
increased awareness of the Government of the need to further adapt the policy and
regulatory framework and to involve the private sector in the provision of
telecommunications services.
38.       The economic rate of return (ERR) was recalculated using the methodology
in the SAR. The amounts used in the calculation are based on actual figures upto 1994.
Projections from 1995 to 2014 are based on the actual amounts in 1994. The ERR is



8
calculated at 18 percent (Part II, Table 9). This is below the 20 percent projected at
appraisal, but is considered satisfactory.
Sustainability
39.       Most of the major physical, institutional and financial indicators have been
achieved, and some of them have been exceeded. OPTB is committed, through a
performance contract (Contrat de Programme) with the Government, to continue the
network expansion, improve the service quality and maintain the financial performance of
its operation. The focus placed on the projected performance indicators for the coming
years (Part II. Table 6), as stipulated in the current performance contract will contribute to
the project's long term institutional and financial sustainability.
40.       The project established a good base to sustain adequate maintenance of
infrastructure (such as tools, vehicles and repair shop). Training of staff was also an
important component as well as information technology tools to improve customer
service (billing, customer service).
41.       In spite of less favorable financial results expected in 1994, OPTB should be
able to contribute adequately to the financing of the required projects for additional
expansion.
42.       These results create favorable conditions for the project's sustainability and
the continuation, through the life period of the new facilities, of their support to the
country's economic and social growth. Also, under the project, a dialogue was initiated
on the need for a new approach to sector policy issues and the determination of
restructuring and reform objectives, in line with the current worldwide trends of moving
away from public sector to private investment and competition.
E. Bank Performance
Preparation, Appraisal
43.       GOB first requested the assistance of IDA to finance investment in 1982 of
the telecommunications sector. Further to the work of two reconnaissance missions, IDA
produced a sector report in 1983. The report concluded that the current state of
telecommunications is what constituted a major bottleneck to economic development, and
that OPTB was ineffective due to manpower, organizational and financial constraints.
44.       The request of GOB for an advance of US$500,000 under the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) was approved by IDA in March 1984. The advance
contributed to the cost of preparatory engineering and management assistance to the



9
project. A second advance of US$250,000 was approved in June 1987 and a third of
US$500,000 in February 1988.
45.       The project cost has been estimated at US$65 million for which an IDA credit
of the equivalent of US$16 million has been requested. The AfDB (US$19.62 million)
financed local network for Porto Novo, transmission upgrade, and technical assistance
and training. The CFD (US$13.91 million) financed digital switching exchanges in
Cotonou and Porto Novo, as well as technical assistance. EIB (US$7.78 million)
financed local network in Cotonou and interchange network in Cotonou and Porto Novo.
CIDA (US$3.5 million) financed technical assistance and rural network.
Supervision
46.       Regular supervision took place. As shown in Part II. Table 13, seven
supervision missions took place from July 1989 to October 1994. The cooperation
between OPTB and the Bank's project team was excellent. Staff continuity on both the
Bank and OPTB side contributed to the good process.
47.       Coordination with other donors was also excellent and some supervision
missions were carried out jointly and in liaison with local representatives.
F. Borrower Performance
48.       OPTB was the Borrower and the Government the Guarantor. With respect to
the achievement of physical objectives, OPTB performance appears highly satisfactory,
particularly considering the lack of previous experience in managing a large development
project. Regarding the implementation of the institutional component, the performance
was less satisfactory, in particular regarding the role of Government as supervisor and
customer of telecommunications services.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
49.       The status of compliance with legal covenants is detailed in Table 10. The
reasons for partial compliance are explained in the above paragraphs: (a) budgeting of
telecommunications expenses for the Government and its agencies (part of 1993 and 1994
expenses have been uncompensated); and (b) the rate of return on assets fell under 10
percent in 1994 following the devaluation of the CFA Franc.
G. Assessment of Outcome
50.       The Project outcome is satisfactory.  The project exceeded some of its
physical objectives and achieved most of the institutional and financial objectives.



l0
H. Future Operation.
51.       The operational and financial objectives of the project during the operation
phase are presented in part II, Table 6. The full utilization of the switching infrastructure
installed under the project is expected to be achieved in 1995. The full utilization of the
outside plant infrastructure will require additional investment for switching and cable
expansion, OPTB has the capacity to finance these components on its own funds.
I. Key Lessons Learned
52.       The key lessons learned are as follows:
(a) Project implementation has been facilitated by the continuity of Bank staff
assigned to thiis project and a sustained consultation and coordination of
activities between OPTB, GOB authorities and the involved donors;
(b) The full realization of the institutional objectives of the project would have
required the involvement of the Government authorities in a more active way
during project pieparation and supervision, particularly in the field of staff
statute and Government arrears for telecommunications services; and
(c)  In-depth sector reorganization and reform of public utilities type sectors
traditionally operated in a monopolistic environment, such as Posts and
Telecoms, is a difficult, complex and slow process. The dialogue and
consultation process initiated under the project between the interested parties,
GOB authorities and the donors, should be continued, including IDA
involvement, to encourage and support further restructuring and determine ways
and means to implement the needed changes.

l'OPTB ont mis au point. au debut de 1993. un projet de convention collective des agents de l'OPTB.
accompagnee d'une grille de salaires. pour lequel ils ont recu des amendements de la part des svndicats. en
juin 1994. Un arrere de juillet 1 994 a consticue une commission pariraire. rassemblant des representants du
Ministere du travazi. de i'OPTB et aes sondicats. quw nezociera la convention amendee. a oartir du 1 i
novemore. On prevoit que la convention pourraic erre signee au cours du premier trimescre deI995.
11. En ce qui concerne ['amelioration du svsteme de gestion (article 10). l'OPTB a progressivement mis
au point un systeme inte,re de compcabilite de aestion. mais cette operation n est pas cerrminee et
l'integration est incomplete. Le systeme de gestion par objectifs est en gestation. en effet la preparation du
budget de 1995 s-appuiera sur une decomposition pius fine de l'entreprise OPTB que le rartage du passe
(une vingtaine de centres de responsabilit6 au lieu de trois). sur la voie de ['analvse prevue en 67 centres.
12. En ce qui concerne les objectifs relatifs a la eestion des ressources humaines (article 11). l'OPTB n'a
effecrue aucun recrutement, en 1993 et en 1994 (les departs naturels sont de l'ordre de soixante dix a
quarre vingts par an). Des erudes ont et6 menees par des consuitants pour dererminer les niveaux de
reference d'une eestion efficace de la poste et des telecommunications. qui conduirait a des reductions
spectaculaires de 1'effectif. de 1992 a 1997. Ces etudes nWont pas tee prises en compte par la direction de
l'OPTB et aucun programme de resorption ne les a encore suivies. L-OPTB a effecrue une proJection
d'effertif a moven terme. Le plan de formation concernant 300 cadres a ete mene a bien er un plan
d'urgence de formation a la gestion du personnel d'execution est en train de se derouler.
13. Les recommandations relatives aux relations avec ['Etat. et a la gestion financiere (articles 12 et 13).
ont etc suivies par l'OPTB des 1993. Elles devaient faciliter l acquittement des consommations de l'Etat et
requeraient I'OPTB de presenter des etats financiers par branche (poste et telecommunications). Une etude
tarifaire a ere achevee en fevrier 1994.
14. Les objectifs d-exploitation des telecom tarticles 14 et 1 5) sont atteints avec une confortable marge:
-   le nombre d'agents des relecom par 1.000 Iienes est de 76. en 1993 (78 fixes pour 1994).
-   les charzes d'exploitation par 1.000 lignes sona de I 50,5 kFCFA. en 1993 (181 kFCFA fixees
pour 1994),
-   le nombre de lignes de service et d'exploitation sont de 923. a Ia de fin de 1993 (1. 100 fixees
pour 1994). et la consommation de ces lignes est reduite de 17,'o par rapport a celle de 1991
(rdduction proche des 209'% fixee pour 1994), mats il est beaucoup plus significatif de
constater qu'elle ne represente plus que 7.6% du chiffre d'affaires des telecom. contre 12.5%/o
en 1991:
-   le parc des lignes facturees est de 20.700. a ta fin de 1993 (18.'00 fixdes pour 1994).



Paze 3
15. Les ob,iectifs commerciaux e les objectifs de qualite de service des telecom Iarticle 16) semblent
devoir etre arteints a la Fin de 1994 saut' en ce quz concerne la satisfaction de la demande dont le niveau a
expiose apres la mise en service du nouveau reseau.
-   les demandes d'abonnement satisfaites. en 1993. sont de 70'o en moins de I 5 jours. et de
85% en moins d'un mots (80% et 99% Fixees pour 1994).
-   le parc de demandes de raccordement est en. 1993. de 3500 (100 fixe pour la Fin de 1994).
-   le taux de si2nafisation de derangement des lignes principaies est de 12'a en 1993 (50% fixe
pour Ia fin de 1994).
-   la vitesse de releve des derangements est. en 1993. de 78 o en 48 heures. de 90o en 8 jours.
de 92% en 30 jours i 75%O. 95%O et 99%. fixdes pour 1994).
-   les plus recents taux de recouvrcenren bimesrriels des creances privees sont. en ocrobre 1994.
de 85o apres 4 mois. de 87.5%'o (mcyenne de 2 bimesrres) apres 12 mois. de 90.5%.o (movenne
de 3 bimesrres) apres 24 mois (90%16. 93% et 95% respectivement. fixes pour 1994): ii semble
que les objectifs aient ete un peu conrraienants:
-   le nombre annuel des reciamations par 1.000 abonnes est. en 1993. de 23 (30 flxe pour la fin
de 1994).
16. Les objectifs commerciaux et les objectifs de qualite de service de la poste (article 17) sont atteints
avec un succes mitige. notamment pour la collecte de l'epargne. qui est encore assez eloiznee du niveau de
1994. et pour la distribution du courrier. encore olus eloiqnee.
17. les recertes d'affrancnissement orovenant du courrier prive sont de 455 miilions de FCFA d La Fin de
1993 (430 miilions de FCFA fixees pour la fin de 1994).
-   les recertes depart du courrier acceiere sont de 48 millions de FCFA. a ia t-in de 1993 (45
millions de FCFA fixees pour la fin de 1994),
-   I'objectif de la collecte d'eparene nouvelle par la CNE sur 3 ans est de 1.800 millions de
FCFA. Ia valeur collectee a la fin de septembre 1994 est de 2.651 millions de FCFA;
-   les CCP seront complitemenm informatises en novembre 1994, ia CNE le sera a Cotonou en
janvier 1995. et en province en juin 1995,
-   le courrier est remis a 80% a J - I a Cotonou. et a 60% a J - 3 entre Cotonou et les chefs-
lieux. en 1993 (les pourcentages de 95%. fixes dans les deux cas pour 1994. semblent avoir
ete optimistes).
18. Les obiectifs financiers de l'OPTB (article I 8) apparaissent lareement realises. mais ceci est da a une
annee exceptionnellement favorable. alors que les resultats de 1994 s'annoncent nertement moins bons en
raison de la devaluation du FCFA:
-   la marze brute d'autofinancement de i'OPT8 est. en 1993. de 5.000 millions de FCFA. contre
1.854 millions de FCFA prevue en 1994.
-   le taux de renrabilire des immobilisations des relecom esi. en 1993. de 3 I'lo. conrre 8% prevu
en 1994,
-   le ratio d'endettement des telecom est. en 1993. de 1.1 conrre 2.1 prevu en 1994.
19. Les objectifs relatifs aux investissements des telecom (article 19) ont tous ete realises. avec seulement
un retard pour les raccordements des abonnes de Porto Novo ien juin 1995. avec un an de retard)
20. Les engagements de 1'Etat retevent des articles 20 et 2 I du conrrat de programme.
2 1. Une declaration de politique sectorielle. definissant les grandes litnes de la reforme du secreur doit
erre promulguee procnainement par le gouvernement. L'etude sur Ia viabilite des sous-secteurs de la poste
et des td1ecommunications sera entreprise par une mission prochaine de consultants et les projets de textes
legislatifs seront mis au point par la suite.

22. L Etat contmue a ne pas s'acquirter des oblizations de rdlement de ses consommaEions en services de
telecommunications. en depit du soin pris par l'OPTB a remplir ses propres obligations (article 1'). Les
divers ministeres ne reglent pas leurs factures scion des affectations budgetaires calculees sur leurs
consommations les plus recentes. mais laissent s'accumuler ies impaves. Aussi. en demier recours. l'OPTB
presente-E-il des etars de compensation que I'EEat ignore. en pavant de facon erratique. A la fin du mois
d'aouE 1994. apres un paiement de 134 miilions de FCFA en Juillet. IEtat etaiE redevable. d'apres les
calculs de l'OPTB. d'un solde de 334 millions de FCFA sur ics consommaEions de 1993 et de quarre
bimesrres de consommaEion de 1994 (environ 660 millions de FCFA. par reference a une consommation
annueile de 982 miliions de FCFA en 1993).
23. L'OPTB crott pouvoir s'appuyer sur la communication n' 9'4!94 du conseil des ministres du 8 aout
1994. demandant au Ministre des finances de paver par avances les consommations des divers ministeres
sur la base des facrures anterieures de I OPTB. L'augmenration reguliere de la consommation des
ministeres chaque annee. en depit des restrictions imposees par l'OPTB. conrraint I'OPTB a rester rres
vigilant et de ne pas ecarer 1'eventualite de suspendre des lienes. en verru du privilege qui lui a ete accorde
par le President de la RepubLique. le 17 septembre 1990 (loi n' 90-026). et qu'il pourrait etendre aux clients
publics. La direction financiere et com,ntable de l'OPTB va merrre au point une procedure de paiement
avec la direction du budget du ministere des finances pour appliquer sans delai la recommandation du
conseil des ministres.
24. Bien que ce ne oit pas mentionne dans le contrat de croeramme. il est clair que l[EtaE doit s'acquitter
poncruellement de ses oblizations intemautonales er paver ies ecneances des derEes oostales qui ont fait
l'objeE de compensations avec l'OPTB.
25.     Le ministere de rutelle n a pas. comme la mission l avait recommande l annee demiere eE comme
le prevoiE l'article 2'. analvse deux fois par an avec i'OPTB les realisaEions du contrat de programme.
C'euit ete l'occasion de constater les retards, de maintenir un dialogue indispensable entre l'OPTB et sa
tutelle et d'envisazer des mesures pour combler les retards. Le present contrat de proeramme vient a
expiration le 31 decembre 1994. II est urgent que I'OPTB redige des maintenant le nouveau contrat
triennal. afin de le soumertre a I'approbation du gouvemement avant la fin de l'annee.
Situation financiere
26. Resultats de 19^. La devaluation de janvier 1994 du FCFA perrurbe profondement les comptes de
1993 de l'OPTB. En effet. la provision pour perre de change est de 13.6 milliards de FCFA et a besoin
d'etre etalde sur quarre ans pour laisser les comptes annuels lecerement beneficiaires. II en resul!e que
l'Etat ne pourra pas prelever le dividende escompte. qus est calcule arbitrairement en rant que I'2%o du
chiffre d'affaires er est estime a 1.46 millions de FCFA pour 1993. car le benefice residuel de L'OPTB. en
1993. sera minimal. en depit de l'etalement de la provision pour perte de change. L'Etat devra aussi
continuer a exonerer l'OPTB d'imp6t sur les benefices. en 1995 et en 1996. pour la meme raison. Afin
d'alleger sa charge de tresorerie. l'OPTB voudrait que l'Etat lui permerte de calculer les interets sur les
emprunts. exprimes avec l'ancien taux de change et. en conrrepartie. de renoncer a augmenter les tarifs.
27. Bien qu on ait la quasi-certitude que l'annee 1994 sera beaucoup moins favorable pour i'OPTB que
l'annee 1993. [es marges et les maux d'autofinancement calcules a propos de l'execution du conrrat de
programme indiquernt clairement que l'OPTB pourrait apporter sa part de financement a un programme
d'urgence qu'un bailleur de fonds. comme la CFD ou la BAD. consentirait a cofinancer.
28. Comntes clients 2rives. 1ly a une approche plus traditionnelle que les taux de recouvrement de la
facturation des services des telecommunications. c'est 1'expression des comptes des clients prives en mois
de facturation. Les comptes clients representent. a la fin de 1993. plus de trois mois de facturation, ce qui
est encore trop fort.

Gestion de 1'OPTB
29. Les obiectifs d'amelioration de la zestion de l'OPTB  porralent sur les axes suivants: (a) une meilleure
coordination et un suivi de la realisanon des actions du programme d' invesussement: (b) la -estion
financiere et comptable: (c) la aestion commerciale:  dl la aestion des ressources humatnes: (e) la gestion
des services postaux et financiers: (f) le developpement d'un systeme d'intormation et de tacon plus
generale. d'une culrure d'enrrepnse. Ces actions ont ete soutenues par un important Dro-ramme
d'assistance technique supporte par les bailleurs de fonds (ACD[. CFD. IDA. BAD. FAC). Le biian global
de ces interventions s'annonce tres posinf. de nombreuses amelioranons sont routerois possibles dans
cernains domaines.
30. En matiere de coordination er suiv i. I'OPTB a ete en mesure de maitriser le deroulement du projeE et
de foumir r6eulierement les informanons relatives a I'avancement des cravaux. certe coordination s'est
effectuee au niveau de la direction generale en particulier pour les reformes de strucrures et de procedures.
ainsi qu'au niveau des r6alisarions techniques.
Gestion financiere C! comotable
3 1. Comgtabilit6. Les procedures comptables sont redieees depuis la fin de 1992. 11 est necessaire. pour
que le svsteme SUN soit compieremenc inregre er operanionnel. que toutes les comprabilires auxiliaires
soient intormatisees. aue leurs interfaces avec la comoiabiliE aeneralie soient assurees Dour le verrouiilaze
du svsteme et que du personnel soit recrute ou rorme pour raire tonctionner ies comprabilites auxiliaires.
Les gestions de la rresorerie. des projets d' invesrissement iimportante application avec incidence sur la
gestion du fichier des immobilisarions) et des emprunts ( petite appiication) ne sont pas inr'ormatisees. les
interfaces manquent. entre la compcabiEie generale. d'une part. et la comptabiiire teiephonique (les
comptes de liaison sonr manuels) et la gestion des stocks. d'autre part.
32. 11 a etr convenu que ['informatisation de la gestion de la tresorerie et de la gestion des projers
d'investissement serait financee sur le reliquat du credit IDA et serait confide. faute de temps. au consultant
qui a installk le logiciel SUNr. Le projet de conrrat doit parvenir a ['IDA avant le I er novembre pour que
l'intervenrion soit achevee avant la cl6&ure du credit. le 31 decembre. Le reste du pro,ramme inacheve
d'inforTnatisation pourrait etre finance sur l'avance de fonds d'ut eventuel nouveau projet a financer par la
Banque. L'evolution de tout le systeme comptable. y compris I'41aboration de la comprabilite analvtique.
necessirera ensuire l'intervention de consultants. en vue d'assurer ia coherence du svsremu.
33. Ourre Ie personnel necessaire a la tenue des comotabilirs auxiliaires. Ia direction financiere et
cotnptable a besoin de recrurer une dizaine de comptables pour eroffer le personnei. et d'assurer ia
forrnation de ses cadres. en vue de la separation de la posEe et des telecommunicaEzons. L'informatriation
des comptabilites auxiliaires de [a poste a beaucoup progresse. puisque celle des cheques postaux (CCP) est
operationneile a Cotonou. depuis mai 1994. et le sera en province en novembre. que celle de la caisse
nationale d'epargne (CNE) le sera a Cotonou. en janvier 1995. et en province a la fin de juin. que celle du
centre de contrdle des mandats (CCOM) sera operationnelle en decembre 1994 et enfin que celle du centre
de controie des bureaux (CCB) le sera a la fin de juin 1995.
34. Tacifs. Des consultants ont remis leur rapport en novembre 1993 et ont amende leurs
recommandaEions. en fevrier 1994, pour tenir compte de la devaluation de 50% de janvier. Suivant les
conclusions du rapport. i'OPTB a augmente les tarifs de '59' en juillet 1994. sans modifier la taxe de base,
restee a 60 FCFA. mais en rapprochant les impulsions. 11 a aussi reduit le nombre de zones geographiques.
de 9 a 4. et introduit une taxation a ia duree et une taxation a Eranche horaire pour les ceniraux
electroniques: I taxe de base pour 3 minutes. de 7 heures a 20 heures. et pour une duree illimitee la nuit. et
une taxe de base coutes les 15 secondes pour les liaisons entre la c6te et le nord. Les frais de raccordement
et les abonnements bimestriels (4.380 FCFA) ont aussi ete augmentes de '5%. la penalite de retablissement
apres suspension a ete multipliee par 2,7 pour la rendre plus dissuasive. Le tarif international. qui etait trop
eleve avant la devaluation. a aussi tet augmente de 25%. eE l'OPTB estime. que bien que le trafic tende a
s'etablir dans le sens Europe-Benin. le tarif pourrait encore erre auzmentE. Des ajustements fumurs pourront
etre decides par le Conseil d'adminisrracion de l'OPTB. au cours de la preparation du budget, en fonction
des resultats.

35. Suivi de la "est=on. La comptaoilite budaetaire est deia operaEtonnelle depuis deux ans. mals sur un
modele fruste. avec une decomposition en trots centres de responsabilite seulement. L-OPTB compte
ameliorer ia methode (voir le conrrat de programme). UIne incervention de consultant est donc requise pour
perfectionner la multode budgetaire. Celle-ci est d'autanE plus necessaire au'ele doit preparer l'installation
d'une sntucaure de planification d'entreprise. sur le meme modele mais avec un horizon a moven terme (les
projections linancieres a moven terme preparees par un consuhtant sont une prefizuration de ce que ia
cellule de planification devrait produirei
36. [1 faudra aussi mettre en place a l'OPTB un service de contr6le interne. dont le r6le sera de mertre i
jour routes les procedures de l'enrreprise. et de rapporter au directeur general rous les cas ou il y a
probleme et de les resoudre. et de proposer une solution chaaue r ois qu'une amelioration semble
souhaimable dans un rouage de l'encreprise.
nfriue
37. L'OPTB a acquis un systeme loziciel. SUN. pour rraiter tous les volets de la comptabilit6. Ce logiciel
semble pouvoir satisfaire les besoins acruels de l'OPTB. mais la prise en charee des comptabilires
auxiliaires et de la comptabilit: eenerale et Vutili:acion de la comptabiiite analvtique necessitent chaque
fois l'inrervention de consultants. oeu-erre en raison de la difflculte de nouer le dialogue enrre les
informaauicens et les services administratirs. mais aussi parce que le systeme est compiexe. La comopabilite.
Ia pave et la gestion des immobiiisaEions ont ete mrnorrraEisees. mais il manque. pour la gestion des stocks
et des fourmisseurs et pour la gestion des clients. un interface entre les comptabilites auxiliaires et aenerale.
11 est prevu d'informatiser. avant la fin de lannee 1994. la gestion de la rresorerie et celle des projets
d' investissement.
38. L'OPTB a eu recours, pour mertre en place la comprabilite relephonique. a un consultant qui a installd
son propre logiciel. avec trois applications. FACT 300 (facruration et recouvrement tel6phonique). 400
(gestion et demande de services) et 500 (gestion des rcseaux). La difficultd majeure de la maintenance est
que le consultant est situd a Montreal et que. soucieux de conserver l'integrite de son logiciel. il l'a
verrouilld. D'ou des lenteurs, qui s'ajoutent i l'absence d'interface avec la comptabilit: gendrale.
39. L'OPTB a aussi e1abore un logiciel propre pour la gestion du personnel. avec un interface en cours de
r6alisation avec la pave. Le prob'eme de dialoeue ne se pose pas en ce qui concerne la poste. pour laquelle
la gestion informatisee des CCP est realisee. et celle du centre de contrrle des mandats (CCM') en cours
d'achevernent. L'informatisation de la Caisse Nationale d'Epargne (CNE) vient de commencer le 26
septembre 1994 et celle du centre de conrr6le des bureaux (CCB) va suivre au debut de 1995.
40. Toutes les applications informatiques se sont deveioppees reiativement lentement et on a la nerte
impression d'un manque de cohesion. ressentie aussi par les utilisateurs. Aussi la necessite d'un audit
informacique, qui avait te6 exprimee dans l'aide-memoire de ddcembre 1993. se fait-elle sentir encore
davanrage. du fait de la complexite croissante du systeme et de la difficultd du personnel a mairriser un
logiciel qui depend encore facheusement d'inrtrventions exterieures. Entin. malzrd les travaux enrrepris.
[es tableaux de bord ne sont pas passes en phase operationnelle.

Gession Cornrerciale des Tfcomrnmunications
41. Comptabilite td :nhonioue. La comptabilit6 telephoniaue depend beaucouo de l'application
informarique. pour la facruration. pour le recouvrement et pour la cestion tcchnique des abonnes. L'audit
nformantiue la concerne au oremier chetf. La faccuration est actuellement bimestrielle et il est envisage de
la mensualiser pour [es zros clients et de I'taler pour les autres. pour repartir la charze de travail et reduire
les delais de diszribution et pour mieux aiimenter la tresorerie. Les taux de recouvrement des creances n'ont
pas reussi a arteindre des obJectifs peuE-trre trop ambitieux. mais un taux de 90% au ocUt de deux ans est
satisfaisant. Ii reste a analvser les maroes non recouvrees. pour distinguer ce qui es[ vrazment
incompressible de ce qut est ameliorable. La mission a note cependant quelques difficultes subsisEant dans
la maintenance des appiications informaticues ainsi que le nombre eleve des abonnes suspendus (environ
1O% du parc fir. 1993).
42. Ouverrure commerciale, L'action commerciale de lIOPTB se poursuit dans deux directions.
l'accroissemenc du concact avec la clientele. par ie developpement de reseaux de points de vente de
services courants. comme les telecommerces. ou tous les services de telecommunications sont offerts dans
des boutiques (ii faudrait d'ailleurs que i'OPTB favorise aussi les initiatives privees en les aidant dans leurs
impiantations), au la recherche des movens de satistaire ses besoins. par des enquetes et par des entretiens
notamment. et par l'analvse de l' incidence de mesures tarifaires. L'OPTB se soucie aussi de developper de
nouveaux produits. en s'inspirant des modeies internationaux: services a valeur ajoutee. qui utilisent le
reseau aes services de base. comme la transmission de donnees. et services encadres sur un marcne
restreint. comme le telephone ceilulaire.
43. Gestion des ressources humaines. Des divisions ont ete mises en place a la Poste et aux Telecoms. le
fichier du personnel a ete informatise e.i 1991. une gestion previsionnelle des effectifs est en place. les
procedures de gestion ont ete formalisees. Un important programme de formation a d,6 defini. se traduisant
par un voiet de formation d;;s cadres (300 personnes touchees) et des agents d'execution. Certe derniere
s'est reaiisee dans le :adie du Centre de Formation Professionnel qui a acquis un certain nombre de
modules pedagogiques. des formations specifiques ont 6t6 assurees par les fournisseurs d'equipement. Les
formations d'ordre administratif (en particulier comptabilit&) n'ont cependant pas beneficie de ia meme
priorite et constiruent une priorite pour le furur.
Gestion des services nostaux et Financiers
44. La situation de la poste seule peut erre ameiioree par un certain nombre de mesures:
Ia qua'ite de service est insuffisante: la poste s'en preoccuoe en procedanE a des enouctes aupres
du public. cz qut pourra indiquer de nouvelles directions a suivre. mals d'ores et deja on saiE que
la distribution du courrier est trap lente et les resultats du contrat de proaramme le mettent en
evidence:
eI developpement de services nouveaux. comme le courrier d'entreprise ou le courrier non
adresse, et ia lurte contre la concurrence du courrier a service rapide. sont necessaires mais ne
peuvent pas produire de resultats specraculaires:
une solution. preconisee depuis longtemps et budgetisee sans realisation. est de supprimer la
distribution a domicile ordinaire et d'investir dans la construction de boites postales: cet
investissement. s'il est suivi des mesures aeproprizes de suppression de postes. doit etre tr6s
rentable ee changera l'image de la poste:
une aurre solution qui merite une enude poussee est la resErucruration du reseau d'etablissements.
c'est a dire la reconversion de Ia majeure partie des 63 bureaux de plein exercice en bureaux
annexes. suivant une formule souple pour aboutir a une reduction de charges.
45. Sur un plan plus general. l'OPTB doit reprendre ses operations financieres de mandats avec la Poste
franSaise. interrompues a la suite d'une perte de change de 3.6 milliards de FCFA. subie par l'OPTB dans
un transfert. a la veille de la devaluation du franc CFA. et imputable selon lui a la BCEAO. et du non-
paiement par l'Etat beninois de dertes postales qui avaient e6t compensecs avec l'OPTB. Celles-ci viennent
d'etre reglees et les operations financieres devraient reprendre.

46. L'annee 1993 a erE touE a fait favorable pour ia poste. putsoue son benefice de 364 millions de FCFA
resulre de recertes excepEionnelies sur les manoaas et sur les virements exteereurs. mats ['annee 199' n avait
pas ete rrop mauvaise car son deficiE n'etair que de 162 millions de FCFA. Si on considcre 1'ensemble des
services financiers. ['informatusarton cn cours des operations des CCP. de la CNE. des CCM et des CCB est
positive pour l'imaze des services postaux. mais ne pourra vraimenE etre rentable que si elle est
accompaanee de la suppression d-empiois devenus inutiles.
47. Cependant le bloc. qut serait constirue oar la poste. par les CCP et par la CNE comme II est prevu.
permerrrai: un alleernent dc char2es. et ia aesrion de sa masse de capitaux (S mililards de FCFA a la CNE
et 4 miiliards de FCFA aux CCP) pourrait etre menee de facon plus efficace qu'une -esEton fracrtonnee. 11
sembie ainsi que. sous certanes conditions a preciser. Ia viabilite de ['ensemble de la poste et des services
fiuanciers puisse er:e ctablie.
Obiectifs du orooramme d'investissement Fixes dans le rapport d evalualion
48. Ces objectifs ont ete repris et acrualises a l[occasion des differenEs contrats de proaramme. Si l'on s'en
tient aux objectifs fixes dans le rapport d'evaluaEion. la mission a constate les points suivants. Les
raccordements sur les nouveaux reseaux etaient prevus a partir de mt-9 1. iis ont debute en debut 93. soit
avec un ecart de 18 mots sur Cotonou. En ce qut concerne les reseaux de Porto Novo et d'Abomey. ils sont
prevus a partir de mi-95 en raison de decalages ies a la mise en place des financements i BAD) et dans la
realisation.
49. Les objecEifs phvsiques ont cependant ete tenus comme en temogane le tableau 5.a. Le parc
d'equipements de commutation arteint 35.724 en decembre i993 par rapport a un objectif de 30.350. Les
lignes reliees sont de 20.483 (objectif20.550). Le parc d'abonnes telex esE reste stationnaire. en
conformite avec les tendances mandiales.
50. L'accroissement de la qualite de service est important sur les nouveaux reseaux (tableaux 5.a. et 5.b.).
Le taux de deranzements a ete divise par 4 a Cotonou mais demeure relativement eleve (0.7 par li_ne et par
an) par rapport aux normes internationales. La vitesse de reieve des derangements le jour meme a double.
En terme d'efficacite des appels. I'amdiioration est notable en local. mais inferieure aux objectifs.
L'efftcacire en interurbain reste mauvaise.
51. Co_t du -roiet. Le coat du Drojec est estime a 3-9.8 millions de FF (equivalent a 56.6 millions de
dollars EU) (sans la composante fmnancee par l[ACDI dont le coat final n est pas connu). Ce chiffre est i
rapprocher de i[estimation correspondante du rapport d evaluation qui est de 370.2 miiions de FF
(equivalent a 61.7 millions de dollars EU).
52. Indicateurs de performance. Les indicareurs de performance er leurs projections sur la periode
d'expioitation du projet ont ete foumis par l'OPTB. Les projections s'appuient sur une evaluation recente
de la demande telephonique realisee avec I'aide de '1UIT (Juin 1994) et conduisent a un rriplemnent du parc
d'ici l'horizon 2000 (hvpothese haute). Le besoin en Financement sur la periode est esEime a 3 millions de
dollars EU.
53. Etats financiers et commres audites. La revision des comptes de l'OPTB a er: effectuee sur
financement BAD. chaque annee du projet. par des reviseurs de reputation internationaie. avec un retard
pouvanE aller iusqu'a huit mois. Le reviseur adjoignait a son rapport de revision une liste de
recommandarions. qui lui permertair d'exprimer clairement les raisons pour lesquelles les compres n-etaient
pas encore cerEifiables. 11 est certain qu'ils ne le seront pas tant aue la comptabilite ne sera pas
completement inforrmatisee. car. pour informatiser. il fauE redizer des procedures srrctes et ameiiorer les
pratiques comptables.

54. Par suite d'un malentendu. I OPTB a pris du retard. en 1994. dans le recrutement d'un reviseur
comptable. finance par la BAD. pour Les comptes de 1993. A la suite d'une Ierte de la Banque insistant sur
la necessite d'une revision comptable. I'OPTB a decide que la consultation serait lancee Ie I  octobre. La
revision commencerait le I 5 decembre et le rapport de revision serait pret le 15 mars 1995. Ii sera
necessaire. pour les besoins du rapport d'achevement du projet. que le rapport de revision certifie que Eous
Ies prelevements sur les fonds du credit ont eir ufilises a bonne tinr. Le rapport de revision des comptes
1994 pourrait etre pret vers le 30 juin 1995.
55. RMoartinon finale enrre cateaories du Credit IDA. En raison du retard sur la realisation du reseau de
Porto Novo. ii a 6m suggere que l'OPTB soumerte au plus t6c a l'IDA un projet d'avenant pour la
prolongation de ia mission de l'ingenieur conseil (montant estime i 2'0.000 DTS). ainsi qu'une demande
pour autoriser le report de la date de cioture du credit au 30 juin 1995.Une prestation complemenmaire dans
le domaine de la comptabiliL. sera egalement soumise i l'IDA pour reaiisation avant la fin de l'annee
(estimation 70.000 DTS). Ceci amene a prevoir la repartition suivante entre les categories du credit:
Cateoorie 1:      8.'24.303.77 DTS
Categorie 2'      3.400.000.00 DTS
Cattgorie 3         .575 696,13 DTS
Total:            12.500.000.00 DTS
56. Compte special. Le montant non jusLirie sur l'utilisation du compte special est de I .1 77.1 14 FCFA a
ce jour.
57. Vues de l'OPTB sur V'execution du proie. Un projet preliminaire de conrribution de l'OPTB a ete
discute. La mission a indique ies objectifs de Lc document. a savoir: (a) une opinion sur la realisation des
objectifs du projet. sa conception. sa mise en ceuvre et s:i realisation ainsi que sur son exploitation future;
(b) une evaluation du niveau et de la qualite des prestations de ['OPTS au cours de l'6volution et de la
realisation proprement dite, en pia,ant l'accent sur Ics le,ons pouvant etre tirees de l'experience pour de
fururs projets: et (c) une evaluation des prestations fou,-nies par la Banque et les aurres co-financiers, y
compris de la nature des relations enrre l'OPTB, la Banque et les aurres co-financiers. 11 a ete convenu que
cc document serait transmis a ['IDA d'ici Decembre 1994.
58. Mesures pour une bonne exoioiration future du nroiec. Le projet a conrribue a la mise en ceuvre d'une
serie de movens destines a assurer une bonne exoloitation de l'infrasrrucrure mise en place: des movens
logistiques (vehicules. appareiis de mesure et outillage. maeasin i. une oraanisation et une formation
professionneile pour ies services charges du raccordement et de l'encretien . des outils de gestion de la
clientele et de la facruration. Le programme de raccordemenc prevoit l'utilisation complete des
equipements de commutation durant l'annee 1995. conduisant a une rentabiliE accdler6e du projet.
L'utilisation optimale de l'infrasrructure passe par la realisation d'un proeramme complementaire ctudie
par l'Office et comportant une extension des centraux et des cables. Ce programme pourrait etre finance
par la CFD (reliquats sur convention) pour la commutation et la mission recommande que les achats et
travaux de cables soient finances sur fonds propre de I'Office.
59. Les indicateurs de suivi mis en place durant l'ex6cution du projet permertront de suivre les
performances furures de I'exploitation.
60. Facteurs suscepribles de nuire a la reussice de la phase d'e,xloioation du grojet. Les facteurs suivants
seront d6terminants pour assurer une bonne exploitation du projet: le maintien des competences techniques
par un proeramme de formation continue. la prise en compte budgetaire des movens necessaires a la
maintenance. Ia reduction des lignes non productives (suspension). I'ameiioration des taux de
recouvremenE des facrures.
61. Coordination avec les co-financiers. Les vues de la CFD sur lexecution ont ete comm\rniquees a la
Banque, la BEI a prevu une mission avant la fin de i'annce et son rapport parviendra a la Banque. En ce
qui concerne [a BAD. 1'evaluation est prevue plus tard.

62. La mission a recu l'assurance que le crojet de declaration de poliEique sectorielle qui sera soumis a
l'examen du Conseil des Mvinistres comporTe les modifications demandees par la Banque. Ce projet devrait
etre examine dans les 2 ou 3 semaines a venir et sa version dcfinitive adoptee transmise i la Banque dans la
premiere quinzaine du mois de Novembre.
63. Erude de restrucruration nsrisutionnelle du secteur des Postes et T61ecommunication Cette erude
financee au titre du projet d'assistance aux enrreprisest PAE Credit 1748-BEN; commencera le 17 ocEobre.
Une reunion pour le demarrage de cerse enude s'est tenue le 14 octobre a laquelle participaienE le Chef de
Cabinet du Ministre de tutelle. le Directeur General de l'OPT. le Coordonnateur du PAE. les membre de la
mission et le represencant du consultant charge de lerude. HI a etce convenu:
* qu'il etait indispensable cue le consultant dispose des le debut de ses cravaux du projet de declaracion
de politique sectorielle
* qu'une des priorites du ministere etait la mise en place de la strucrure de l'entite de regzementation
*   que les rapports du consultant devaient parvenir des que parus a la Banque afin de permerrre un
echange de vue sur les options a prendre et sur .-s textes a adopter
aque les memes rapports seraienE egalement envoves aux divers bailleurs de fonds interesses par le
secteur
64. Le plan d'ex6cution foumi par le consultant a ete agree. La mission a cependant demande qu'un
rapport supplementaire presentant les options du cadre insticutionnel soit etabli des la fin du premier mois
d'intervention conjointement avec un plan d'action pour la mise en cuvre de la reforme.
65. La mission a rappele certaines obiigations du consultant prevues dans les terimes de reference:
-   preparation des textes de loi et des decrets d'application de la.loi
*   redaction des projets de concessions de services de telecommunications
*   presentation d'oniLins de strucrures viables des enrreprises issues de la separation des postes et
tedlcommunicacions. Ces options basees sur des considerations economiques ne devront pas ecarter a
priori une participation du capital prive ainsi qu'une reduction des effectifs.
66. Prooramme d'investissement VQq5-200  Un plan de developpement des telecommunications sur la
periode 1995-2000 a ets prepare par l'UIT et remis a la mission. l'Office envisage de soumertre a
consideration des bailleurs de fonds le financement du programme d'investissement correspondant.
67. La mission en accord avec la representation de la Caisse Francaise de Developpement ICFD) a
Cotonou estime qu'il serait premarure d'envisager un telle reunion avant que ies conclusions de l'etude sur
la restructuration du secteur des telecommunication n'aient ete discutees et qu'un plan de rdforme n'ait ete
presente.

68. Le nouveau contrat-programme triennal enrre le gouvernement et I'OPTB doit etre signe par les
partenaires avant le 31 decembre 1994. It est important que 1'examen semestriel de son execution encre ses
signataires soit effectif.
69. L'Etat dolt imoerativement acquirter reaulierement ses consommations en services de
teltcommunications. selon les modalites orecisees dans le concrat de proaramme. C'est indispensable a la
