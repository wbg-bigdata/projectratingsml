CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower             : Republic of Zambia
Amount               : US$5.0 million
Terms                : Standard
Project Description : The proposed project would assist the Government
with project planning and preparation by providing
(a) about 35 manyears of long-term expert services
to the PPU and operational ministries or other
government agencies; (b) about 35 manyears of con-
sultant services for feasibility studies, design
work, implementation and other project-related
activities; and (c) training of local staff, ser-
vices, equipment, vehicles, supplies and operating
costs. The project would help the Government achieve
the project targets set out in the Third National
Development Plan (1979-83), and would help train a
cadre of local staff to plan, prepare and implement
projects in future years. The most substantial risk
facing the project concerns the possible difficulties
in recruiting long-term experts. The unsettled condi-
tions in the region may have an impact on the Govern-
ment's ability to recruit the highly-qualified experts
required for planning/project preparation work.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAMBIA
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Zambia for the equivalent of US$5.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical assistance project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A Basic Economic Report on Zambia (1586b-ZA) was issued in December
1977. Its main conclusions are reflected below. The most recent economic data
are summarized in Annex I.
3.        With its large mineral reserves and large area of land suitable
for crops and livestock, Zambia has the potential for rapid and sustained
development. From 1965 through 1977, however, real output grew at a rate of
only 2.8 percent per annum owing to stagnation in mining, agriculture, con-
struction, and transport and communications; the value added by the other
sectors increased at a higher rate - services at 6.7 percent annually and
manufacturing at 7.7 percent annually. In recent years, the Zambian economy
has been battered by a severe economic crisis caused primarily by depressed
world copper prices and exacerbated by external political and transport
difficulties. 1977 GNP per capita was US$450 - virtually unchanged from that
of the previous year. In urban areas, per capita incomes were over three
times those of rural areas, providing a powerful incentive for migration.
Today more than one-third of the country's population lives in towns and there
is substantial urban unemployment.
Goals and Performance
4.        The broad economic and social goals of Zambia's last two national
development plans (1966-1970 and 1972-76) may be summarized as follows:
(i) raising the general level of welfare; (ii) diversifying the economy to
make it less dependent on copper; (iii) narrowing the gap between urban and
rural incomes; and (iv) raising the level of education and developing a wide
range of technical and managerial skills. While progress toward the goals of
more rapid growth, diversification and equity has been relatively slow,
substantial progress has been made in education and training.
5.        Despite stagnation in copper production since independence, Zambia's
heavy dependence upon mining continues; in 1977, the mining sector still
accounted for more than 90 percent of exports and about 21 percent of GDP.
1/   The section on the economy is the same as in the President's Report for
the Coffee Production Project (P-2391a-ZA, November 30, 1978).



Such a heavy reliance has had unfortunate repercussions for the country. Wide
fluctuations in world copper prices have caused serious instability in govern-
ment revenues and the balance of payments. Periods of high prices resulted in
the expansion of expenditure to levels which could not be sustained without
serious stress in periods of low prices. As a result of the current slump in
world demand for copper, Zambia is passing through its most serious economic
crisis since independence (paras. 10-12). Because of the precipitous decline
in copper prices since mid-1974, the mining companies' profits have been
severely squeezed (at times, turning to losses), their tax contribution to
the Government has declined to zero and their growing reliance on borrowing
from the central bank and commercial banks has led to more rapid growth of the
domestic money supply and hence contributed to inflationary pressure.
6.        Although Zambia has plentiful land for the development of crops and
livestock, the contribution of the agricultural sector to increasing welfare,
diversifying the economy and bridging the rural-urban gap has been below its
potential. During the ten years following independence (1964-74), output ex-
panded at a rate of only about two percent annually, failing to keep pace with
population growth and resulting in a continuing reliance on imports of food
and agricultural raw materials, most of which Zambia has the capacity to
produce at home (e.g., wheat, rice, vegetable oils). The failure of the
sector to perform up to its potential has been due largely to government
pricing policies which discouraged production and reduced farm incomes while
insufficient government resources were devoted to the planning and imple-
mentation of programs and projects.
7.        It is against this background that, in the last three years, the
Government has begun to devote greater attention to the rural areas, taking
steps to increase price incentives and improve project implementation capacity
in the rural sector. Agricultural producer prices for a wide range of crops
have been substantially increased since 1973/74 which, together with generally
favorable weather conditions, contributed to more rapid output growth; agri-
cultural value added grew at 4.6 percent per annum during the 1975-77 period.
Maize production hit record levels in 1976 and 1977 and large increases were
registered in the output of cotton, groundnuts, wheat, rice and sunflower
seeds. The Government is committed to maintaining adequate incentives for
farmers and, in August 1978, announced further producer price increases for
the 1978/79 growing season ranging from 10 to 19 percent for maize, sunflower,
groundnuts, wheat and coffee. In addition the Government has taken a number
of steps to increase production directly. Efforts to augment its capacity
to implement projects have begun in rainfed wheat production and a number of
programs have been undertaken to train manpower (particularly youth) for rural
employment. The Government has expressed its intention to strengthen the
Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (MLA) and provincial administrations and a
working group has recently submitted a draft report.  President Kaunda has
charged the MLA with the responsibility for identifying and preparing projects
in eight or nine key areas of high growth potential on which the development
effort would be focused; in some cases these projects may involve only small-
holders, and, in others, estates with joint government and private ownership,



with smallholders as outgrowers. The Bank is currently providing assistance
to a special unit in the MLA for the identification and preparation of
projects in these areas.
8.        Manufacturing, although expanding more slowly than in the 1960's,
has contributed to growth and diversification while providing employment for a
growing number of migrants from the rural areas. However, much of the invest-
ment in manufacturing has been for final stage assembly or processing indus-
tries, necessitating large inputs of imported raw materials and capital goods.
Such a structure of development has made the sector more vulnerable to periodic
foreign exchange shortages and meant that its contribution to import substitu-
tion and employment has been less than would have been the case with an
investment policy more oriented towards agro-processing and resource based
industries - e.g., fruits and vegetables processing, cooking oil, sugar,
copperwire and cable, textiles and clothing, wood products, and furniture.
9.        Zambia has made important strides in improving the economic and
social infrastructure necessary for future development. Investments in power
and transportation have laid the basis for a future expansion in copper pro-
duction and the rest of the modern sector. At independence, there was a
severe shortage of skilled manpower (e.g., Zambian university graduates
numbered less than 100). Since then the expansion of the educational system
has been impressive. From 1964 to 1974, primary school enrollments doubled
and secondary and technical school enrollments more than quadrupled; since its
establishment in 1966, the University of Zambia has produced 860 graduates and
enrollment has increased more than sevenfold. Despite these achievements,
skilled manpower remains an important constraint on the development effort.
The Current Economic Crisis
10.       Because of Zambia's dependence upon copper, the fall in copper
prices from US$0.93/lb in 1974 to an average of US$0.60/lb during the 1975-77
period has had serious consequences for the balance of payments, government
budget and domestic production. The sharp decline in copper prices (combined
with stagnating copper sales volumes) has led to large balance of payments
deficits beginning in 1975. Despite government controls on imports (which,
when combined with an average rate of increase of 20 percent annually in
import prices, have sharply reduced import volumes), a 20 percent devaluation
of the Kwacha in mid-1976 and stricter controls over service payments (e.g.,
expatriate remittances, foreign travel), current account deficits of US$611
million, US$58 million and US$228 million were incurred during the years 1975,
1976 and 1977 respectively. Because net capital inflows during the three
years were far short of the amounts necessary to finance these deficits, large
arrears in payments for imports and for private foreign remittances were
accumulated and foreign exchange holdings declined. By the end of 1977,
arrears had accumulated to US$470 million. Between the ends of 1974 and 1977,
net foreign assets fell from US$119 million to minus US$227 million; gross
international reserves at the end of 1977 stood at US$74 million (the equiva-
lent of just under one month's worth of imports).



- 4 -
11.       Through its import licensing system, the Government has attempted to
allocate foreign exchange to those products most essential for the operation
of the economy. While the real volume of imported consumption items fell 65
percent between 1975 and 1977, imports of capital goods and of spare parts, raw
materials and intermediate goods fell 42 and 32 percent respectively. Shortages
of spare parts and essential intermediate goods have created idle capacity and
unemployment in many productive sectors and contributed to a decline in real
output. While real GDP fell 2 percent between 1975 and 1977, larger declines
were suffered in manufacturing (11 percent), construction (13.8 percent), and
transport, communications and storage (25.8 percent), sectors particularly
affected by shortages of essential imports.
12.       To counter the effects of falling mineral tax revenues, the Govern-
ment has attempted to curb expenditures while increasing non-mineral tax
revenues. Firstly, in contrast to the 1965-75 growth rate of 15 percent per
annum, recurrent expenditures expanded by only 4.2 percent annually during the
1975-77 period (far less than the rate of inflation). Government wages have
been frozen while subsidies were cut by 20 percent through substantial in-
creases in the prices of fertilizers and important basic foods such as maize
meal, wheat flour and bread; nonetheless other recurrent expenditures have
continued to expand, mainly due to greater servicing charges on foreign and
domestic debt and rising prices of goods purchased by Government. Secondly,
capital expenditures have been cut by about 30 percent, severely reducing the
Government's development effort; in real terms government capital expenditures
during 1975 to 1977 were lower than in the late 1960s. Thirdly, non-mineral
tax revenues have been expanded greatly through higher personal and company
taxes and increases in the rates and coverage of sales, excise and customs
taxes; during 1975 to 1977, income tax revenues increased 39 percent while
revenues from sales and excise taxes and tariffs grew by 28 percent. Despite
these expenditure cuts and tax increases, which partially offset the effects
of the precipitous decline in mineral revenues and brought a steady decline
in the size of budgetary deficits over the three year period, deficits con-
tinued to be large and were financed mainly by borrowing from the central
bank and commercial banks; this added to inflationary pressures at a time when
domestic production and declining import volumes were reducing the available
supply of goods. During the 1975-77 period the rate of inflation averaged 14
percent annually.
13.       Adding to Zambia's present difficulties are the major problems it is
experiencing with the transportation of its imports and exports. Some 90
percent of its international traffic currently moves along the transport route
through the Port of Dar-es-Salaam.  Effective capacity on the rail and road
corridor to the Port now has fallen to such a low level as to cause major
disruptions in the movement of both imports and exports, although the recent
reopening of the southern rail route in October 1978, and the planned reopening
of the Benguela Railway in the near future should provide some relief. This
has resulted from (i) the TAZARA Railway's failure to achieve expected per-
formance, due in large measure to new and unseasoned staff, spare part short-
ages, inadequate maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock and difficulties
in offloading goods; (ii) deterioration of road trucking capacity (lack of



- 5 -
spare parts and adequate maintenance); (iii) arrears in payments on freight
and port charges, and (iv) resulting congestion in the Port of Dar-es-Salaam.
At the Government's request the Bank is currently examining ways to help
alleviate these problems.
The 1978 Budget and Economic Program
14.       The Government planned through a reduction in expenditures and in-
creased taxes to bring about a sharp decline in the size of the 1978 budgetary
deficit, thus (together with an expansion in disbursements from foreign
loans) reducing its reliance on borrowing from the central bank and commercial
banks by over 60 percent as compared with the 1977 level; these measures
should contribute to reducing inflationary pressures. Among the major bud-
getary measures were: a reduction in recurrent expenditures mainly due to a
33 percent cut in subsidies resulting from substantial price increases for
maize meal and fertilizers; a freeze on the level of capital investment,
which, taking into account inflation, would reduce the Government's investment
program to the lowest level since independence, and an eight percent increase
in non-mineral revenues mainly through higher duties on imports of capital
goods and luxuries, and higher sales and excise taxes on various luxury items.
However, preliminary estimates suggest that the budgetary deficit may be
somewhat larger than originally planned: while recurrent and capital expendi-
tures will be lower than in the 1978 Budget, there will be a substantial
shortfall in corporate income tax receipts and customs and excise taxes
because of the decline in economic activity and the fall in imports owing to
transport difficulties. In addition to the budgetary measures, the Government
has taken other steps to increase the diversification of the economy and
ensure more appropriate relative factor prices. Among the most important
measures are: (i) a 10 percent devaluation of the Kwacha (on March 17, 1978)
designed to increase the international competitiveness of Zambian goods and,
together with cost cutting measures, to raise mining company profits, thus
reducing their reliance on the domestic banking system for borrowed funds;
(ii) increased agricultural producer prices (see para.7) and a 30 percent
increase in government budgetary investment in agriculture (at a time when the
capital budgets of most other ministries are being cut); (iii) an Industrial
Development Act designed to attract private domestic and foreign capital
through assurances about nationalization and to promote such government goals
as exports, use of local raw materials, use of labor-intensive techniques and
the development of rural, small-scale enterprises through various types of tax
incentives; and (iv) a freeze on wages and an increase in interest rates in
order to hold down private consumption and encourage savings, as well as
promote more labor-intensive production techniques.
External Capital Requirements
15.       Zambia has relied on external capital flows to an extent similar to
other African nations with comparable per capita income (e.g., Ivory Coast
and Congo). The terms of these flows range from the very concessionary terms
given by the People's Republic of China to suppliers' credits and Euro-dollar
loans. With a 24 percent share in debt outstanding and disbursed at the end
of 1977, the Bank is the country's largest creditor, just ahead of the



- 6-
People's Republic of China (22 percent) and private banks (23 percent).
Zambia's outstanding and disbursed external public debt amounted to US$1.3
billion at the end of 1977. Owing to greater reliance on external capital
flows, a growing proportion of which has been from commercial lenders, and
to a trend toward harder loan terms from all sources (except bilateral).
Zambia's debt service ratio has increased since the late 1960s. These fac-
tors, in combination with relatively low copper prices, resulted in a debt
service ratio of 19.4 percent in 1977.
16.       Given current copper price projections and the need to build-up
foreign exchange holdings and pay off arrears, the 1978-80 period will see
continued balance of payments stringency (owing to the sluggish recovery
of the world economy, current Bank projections show little improvement in
real copper prices before 1981). The Government will, therefore, have to
maintain tight import controls with consequent continued shortages of spare
parts and materials, unutilized productive capacity and unemployment. Even
under such restraints, net capital flows required to cover the current
account deficits, pay off arrears, and eliminate the negative net foreign
assets balance by the end of 1980, would amount to about US$1.4 billion over
the three year period. Over US$380 million is being provided by IMF resources,
including a standby agreement (approved by the Fund Board on April 26, 1978),
the Compensatory Financing Facility and the Trust Fund (to date Zambia has
actually drawn about US$180 million from these facilities). Zambia's terms of
trade are expected to improve in the early 1980's (current Bank projections
show an increase in real copper prices, as compared with 1977, of about 33
percent by 1981 and 67 percent by 1985). Its capital requirements, therefore,
should fall, averaging around US$400 million per annum during the 1981-85
period. In obtaining capital over the 1978-85 period, the past trend toward
harder loan terms for Zambia's external borrowing are not expected to continue.
A recent Consultative Group Meeting for Zambia, organized under the auspices
of the Bank, revealed a sizeable increase in bilateral and multilateral aid
committed to Zambia under relatively soft terms. The Bank also considers
Zambia to be eligible for a small amount of IDA lending in view of the
country's large short- and medium-term capital requirements, its recent
progress towards economic diversification and improved fiscal management
(paras. 13 and 14) and its per capita income level. On these assumptions,
Zambia's debt service ratio would average about 23 percent per annum through
1980, slowly declining thereafter as Zambia's terms of trade improve, reaching
about 18 percent in 1985.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
17.       Since 1956, the Bank has made 24 loans and 1 credit to Zambia
totalling about US$530 million. A US$6.0 million credit for a coffee produc-
tion project is scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors on
December 14. Eleven loans, and the credit approved in FY78 for a third
highway project, together totalling US$346 million (65 percent of the total),
financed physical infrastructure projects of which power, transportation and
communications accounted for three quarters of this amount. Four loans for



- 7 -
education helped to expand and develop Zambia's secondary school system,
teacher training, higher education and commercial, agricultural and technical
education. In 1974, the Bank made a loan for urban development and a US$30
million program loan. The program loan was slow to disburse due to dramati-
cally improved copper prices which reduced the Government's need for the
funds, and partly because the disbursement mechanism proved more complicated
than expected. US$12.5 million of the loan was cancelled in June 1975. A
second program loan, extended in late 1976, provided foreign exchange for
importing essential capital and intermediate goods, raw materials and spare
parts for agriculture, mining and manufacturing. The Bank also made a loan to
the Development Bank of Zambia in 1976, to help finance manufacturing and
commercial farming. The Bank made five loans during 1968-77, for industrial
forest plantations, livestock, commercial crops and integrated family farming.
The livestock loan was cancelled in 1973, and the disbursed portion prepaid at
the Government's request. The project was having serious problems due mainly
to adverse pricing policies and poor management. The Family Farming Project
is experiencing managerial difficulties which are being overcome gradually. A
second loan for industrial forestry in 1977, is assisting the Government's
long-term plantation program, and an expansion of logging and sawmilling
capacity. Twelve loans are now fully disbursed. In 1977, the Bank's shares
of Zambia's total debt (disbursed and outstanding) and total debt service
payments were 24 percent and 13 percent respectively. On the basis of present
projections, both of these percentages are expected to be less than 25 percent
in the mid-1980's.
18.       IFC made its first investment in Zambia in 1972, by providing US$1.1
million (including US$227,500 as equity) for the expansion of the Zambia Bata
Shoe Company, Ltd. and, in 1973, invested an additional US$1.2 million in
Bata for a tannery. In May 1975, IFC invested about US$1.0 million in Century
Packages, Ltd. for a packaging materials factory and a further US$100,000 in
January 1978. An IFC investment of US$550,000 equivalent in the share capital
of the Development Bank of Zambia was made in February 1976, in conjunction
with a US$15.0 million Bank loan to that institution. A summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments along with notes on the execution
of ongoing projects is contained in Annex II.
19.       During the past year, the Bank Group has been providing substantial
assistance to the Government in the preparation of programs and projects
for rural development including a coffee production project (to be considered
by the Executive Directors on December 14, 1978) and a cotton project whose
preparation is near completion. Bank Group assistance in this sector, however,
is not limited to agricultural projects as such. The Fourth Education Project,
approved in 1976, includes a major component for training farmers and govern-
ment agricultural technicians. A Rural Water Supply Project, now under
preparation, will provide assistance to smaller towns in predominantly rural
environs.
20.       Agricultural and rural sector development is essential to diversify
the economy and improve rural living conditions. Until recently, progress in
this sector has been difficult, primarily because of the Government's weak-
nesses in making and carrying out suitable policies and in formulating and



- 8 -
implementing effective programs. To help identify the sector's problems and
possible solutions, the Bank, at the Government's request, undertook a rural
sector survey in 1975. The report has stimulated wide discussions about
agriculture and rural development at all levels of Government, and is playing
a key role in increasing cooperation between Zambia and the Bank Group in the
development of this sector.
21.       In addition to the agricultural and rural sector, the Bank Group
has carried out sector surveys of investment opportunities in agro-based
industries, urbanization and water supply and sewerage. A basic economic
mission which visited Zambia in June/July 1975, and subsequent follow-up
missions, focused largely on the industrial and mining sectors as well as
manpower planning in its broadest aspects. The reports of these missions
have provided the basis for a more intensive dialogue between the Bank and
Zambia.
22.       While the Bank Group's program will continue to emphasize agri-
cultural and rural development, it will also continue to support the devel-
opment of industry, and of physical and social infrastructure. At the
Government's request, the Bank Group is reviewing Zambia's transport system
to help identify the system's problems and potential solutions, and a pro-
posed third railway project is being prepared. Further assistance is being
considered for the Development Bank of Zambia to help it continue its efforts
in industry and commercial agriculture. In all aspects of the Bank Group's
program, institution building will continue to occupy a central position.
PART III - THE NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Background
23.       Zambia's present reliance on substantial inflows of technical
assistance can be traced to the colonial period when large investments were
made in mining and industry without a matching emphasis on the development of
the social infrastructure. At independence in 1964, there were only 100
Zambians with a university degree and some 1,200 with secondary school
certificates out of a population of 3.5 million. Four Zambians held pro-
fessional jobs in the government civil service and fewer than twenty were
employed in higher administrative posts. These numbers were totally inade-
quate to manage Zambia's sophisticated, expatriate-controlled modern sector
and to develop programs to improve productivity and the level of services
in the vast rural areas where 70 percent of the population resided. Des-
pite massive expenditures on education (in which the Bank has assisted by
providing four loans for US$69 million), and the resulting sizeable increases
in school enrollments, Zambia has had to continue its dependence on expatri-
ate manpower to fill many positions requiring technical and administrative
skills. At present, there are an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 expatriates
(including dependents) in Zambia, roughly the same as at independence. About
4,500 expatriates work for the two government-controlled copper companies and



- 9 -
another 2,500 are employed in the governmental/parastatal sector under exter-
nally-financed technical assistance programs; the rest work either in the
private sector or for the Government on direct-hire contracts. There are,
however, numerous vacancies in government service and parastatals for posi-
tions requiring managerial expertise or technical skills. The lack of trained
manpower for project preparation and planning has had a particularly serious
impact on economic development as it has constrained preparation of urgently
needed projects which would have furthered economic growth and diversifica-
tion, and it has also delayed the effective coordination and full utiliza-
tion of technical and financial assistance offers from bilateral and other
sources.
24.       Since its independence, Zambia has received substantial inflows of
technical assistance. During the 1972-77 period, external sources contri-
buted an estimated US$170 million in technical assistance to the public sec-
tor. Of this, 79 percent came from bilateral sources, 17 percent from UN
organizations and 4 percent from non-governmental groups. The 1977 break-
down of technical assistance flows, in terms of sectoral allocations and
source, was:

25.       The British Government, through the Overseas Development Ministry
(ODM), supports the largest technical assistance program in Zambia. In 1977,
ODM spent t 7 million (US$12.4 million) to fund or supplement the salaries of
1,057 teachers, experts and advisers, most of whom were employed in the civil
service. The number of individuals involved in these programs has declined
steadily over the last four years due more to shortfalls in recruitment than
reductions in the numbers of authorized posts. The Bank Group has been active
in providing substantial amounts of project-related technical assistance to
Zambia both for future project preparation activities and for project admin-
istration or related institution building purposes.  The Third Highway Project,
approved in May 1978, provides financing for an estimated 1,200 man-months of
consultant services and technical assistance to improve Zambia's road mainte-
nance capability. The Coffee Production Project, to be considered by the
Executive Directors on December 14, contains a small technical assistance
component to assist project implementation and to strengthen coffee research.
Future Requirements for Technical Assistance
26.       The University of Zambia's Manpower Research Unit has estimated
that in 1977 there were 16,000 jobs in the government and parastatal sectors
(excluding mining) requiring post-secondary education. Based on recent data
for cumulative educational output and assumptions on public and private sec-
tor employment, only about 9,000 Zambians with secondary or post-secondary
school education were available for public service in 1977, leaving a short-
fall of at least 7,000 positions. Since 2,500 positions were filled under
official technical assistance programs, about 4,500 posts were subject to
direct government recruitment. Ceilings on governmental and parastatal salary
levels, restrictions on foreign exchange flows, and deterioration in local
living conditions, however, have constrained Zambia's ability to recruit on
the international market. Consequently, many vacancies exist in higher level
positions requiring experienced management skills and technical expertise.
27.       The Zambian Government in its development plans has accepted the
need for technical assistance during the long gestation period necessary to
educate and train enough local manpower to manage the economy. In the past,
the Government has fallen short of its development objectives, in part be-
cause its use of technical assistance was poorly focused. Offers from bila-
teral sources went unutilized, while ministries crucial to diversification
efforts were short of the skilled manpower needed to plan and implement proj-
ects. In 1976, the Government established the Ministry of Economic and Tech-
nical Cooperation (METC), to improve coordination of technical and economic
assistance. The METC tried to match technical assistance requirements with
resources available under external assistance programs, but internal problems
combined with the lack of proper planning capabilities in the operational
ministries hampered its efforts.
28.       The operational ministries' general weakness in planning and project
preparation has contributed to the failure of the previous two Plans to meet
their general targets and to improve economic diversification. In order to



- 11 -
reach the investment objectives of the Third Plan, the Government is placing
great emphasis on better technical assistance coordination in order to
strengthen planning and project preparation. To help with these efforts,
the Government has established a Project Preparation Unit (PPU) in the Na-
tional Commission for Development Planning to assist ministries in preparing
projects. In addition, the Government intends to strengthen planning/project
preparation units in key operational ministries. As part of this effort the
Canadian Government (CIDA), under a Can $2.5 million technical assistance
project, has agreed to provide a team of four advisers in the planning unit
of the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture (MLA) and one adviser in the Plann-
ing Commission. The CIDA project will strengthen MLA's capability to plan,
prepare, implement and evaluate development projects, will improve coordi-
nation between the MLA and the Planning Commission and will provide for an
intensive program of counterpart training.
29.       Zambia's requirements for technical assistance will in fact in-
crease during the Third Plan period. While the Plan has not yet been
finalized its estimated expenditure targets in real terms are projected to
exceed Second Plan levels. Moreover, the focus of the Third Plan on boost-
ing agricultural and industrial productivity would lead to expanded techni-
cal assistance requirements to implement sectoral projects. A prerequisite
to achieving the sectoral investment programs is the need to strengthen
through technical assistance the planning/project preparation capabilities
of the Planning Commission and operational ministries. Zambia's traditional
sources of technical assistance (UNDP, ODM and CIDA) are fully committed to
ongoing programs. While these agencies and other donors indicated their
intention at the First Consultative Group Meeting in June 1978 to step up
their offers of technical assistance, most of it will likely be related to
their ongoing programs. Meanwhile, it is essential that the Government
have immediate access to additional discretionary and flexible resources
for planning/project preparation expertise. With this type of assistance
in place, the Government would be better able to utilize technical and fi-
nancial offers from external sources.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The project was prepared jointly by the Government and the Associ-
ation, following the Government's request in November 1977. Negotiations
were held in Zambia from November 9-13, 1978. Mr. Sichilongo, Permanent
Secretary, Ministry of Finance, and Mr. Simonda, Permanent Secretary, Na-
tional Commission for Development Planning jointly led the Government's
delegation.
Objectives and Description of the Project
31.       The project would help the Government carry out the Third National
Development Plan (1979-83) by strengthening planning and project preparation
capabilities through the provision of (a) long-term expert services in key



- 12 -
ministries and government agencies; (b) short- and medium-term consultant
services to assist project preparation and implementation; and (c) training
of counterpart staff. Specifically, the project would provide for:
(a) about 35 manyears of long-term expert services to the Project
Preparation Unit (PPU) in the National Commission for Develop-
ment Planning and operational ministries or other agencies
of the Borrower to (i) strengthen sectoral planning and re-
source allocation, (ii) improve monitoring of project
preparation/implementation, and (iii) assist with pre-
investment, implementation and supervision of specific de-
velopment projects;
(b) about 35 manyears of consultant services to be used to under-
take feasibility studies, design work, implementation and
other project-related activities; and
(c) training of local staff, services, equipment, vehicles,
supplies and operating costs.
32.       Expert Services.  The project would provide for experts to
strengthen the capability of the PPU and the operational ministries to plan,
prepare and implement high priority projects under the Third National De-
velopment Plan (1979-83). One of the experts to be recruited in the PPU would
be designated the senior expert and would help with the recruitment of the
remaining experts financed under the project. Several experts would be
attached to the PPU, while others would be assigned to those operational
ministries and government agencies that have the highest need for planning/
project preparation assistance.  The Government is in the process of review-
ing the manpower requirements of those ministries and agencies which will
have substantial roles in the Third Plan to determine which ones should be
assisted through the proposed project. The ministries currently being con-
sidered include Industry; Water and Natural Resources; Lands and Agriculture;
Works, Transport and Communication, and Local Government and Housing. Out-
line terms of reference for the experts are provided in Annex IV.
33.       Consultant Services.  The project would also provide funds for
medium- and short-term consultant services to be used for identifying, pre-
paring and implementing high priority projects. Consultants could be em-
ployed to help draw up detailed preparation plans for preparing complex proj-
ects, undertaking feasibility studies, monitoring preparation work, assisting
project start-up by preparing tenders, and helping with project supervision
and implementation. Most of the consultant services would be used to undertake
feasibility studies for high priority agricultural and industrial projects.
Details of several projects which will require consultant services for addi-
tional preparatory work are provided in Annex V. While some of these studies
may lead to projects suitable for Bank Group financing, the consultant services
could be used for preparing any project of high national priority which the
Government intends to implement under the Third Plan.



- 13 -
34.       Counterpart Training and Miscellaneous Operating Expenses.  The
project would provide vehicles and funds for vehicle operating expenses,
local travel, small office equipment, and miscellaneous operating expenses.
The Government would provide office space, secretarial services and would
arrange for housing on a priority basis. The Government has agreed to assign
a qualified local counterpart to each expert financed from the proceeds of
the credit (Section 4.03, draft Development Credit Agreement). Each expert
would be expected to draw up and implement a detailed training program, which
would include plans for on-the-job training, short-term courses and possible
training abroad. The credit provides a small amount of funding for short-term
training courses and other training requirements.
Project Costs and Financing
35.       The estimated project costs are:
US$ Million            Foreign
Local  Foreign  Total          %
1.   Long-term experts (35 manyears)           0.5      2.1     2.6          81
2.   Medium- and short-term con-
sultants services (35 manyears)          0.3      2.3      2.6          89
3.   Vehicles, Equipment, Training,
Operating Expenses                        0.1     0.2      0.3          67
4.   Contingencies                             0.1      0.4     0.5          80
Total                               1.0      5.0     6.0          83
(taxes and duties)                 (0.4)            (0.4)
Total (net of taxes and duties)  (0.6)              (5.6)         90
An IDA credit of US$5.0 million would finance the project's estimated foreign
expenditure costs which amount to 90 percent of total net costs. Expert and
consultant services have been costed at US$75,000/manyear. Price contingen-
cies, calculated at eight percent per annum, have been allowed for salaries,
vehicles, equipment and operating expenses; a physical contingency of ten
percent has been allowed for vehicles, equipment and operating expenses.
Implementation
36.       The National Commission for Development Planning would be the focal
point for project implementation. The Planning Commission, headed by a Min-
ister, comes under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister, who serves as its
chairman. The Commission is responsible for formulating the Third National
Development Plan and monitoring and approving annual capital expenditure



- 14 -
proposals. To help with these responsibilities, the Planning Commission es-
tablished a Project Preparation Unit (PPU), whose duties include assisting
governmental ministries and agencies to prepare high priority investment proj-
ects. In addition to direct assistance for project preparation, the PPU helps
to coordinate the flow of technical assistance and external financial re-
sources to projects which have identified requirements. Under the project,
all proposals for utilization of the funds would be submitted to the Associ-
ation in the form of sub-projects and would be subject to the Association's
agreement (Section 4.02 (a), draft Development Credit Agreement). The initial
sub-project, providing assistance to the PPU, has been discussed and agreed
with the Government. For those sub-projects involving consultancy services,
a working group would be established comprising staff from the PPU and the
ministries or agencies concerned (Section 4.02 (b), draft Development Credit
Agreement). The working group would prepare the sub-project proposals for
approval by the Government and would follow-up with sub-project implementa-
tion. The terms of reference for the PPU and the working groups for sub-
projects are provided in Annex VI.
37.       In submitting sub-projects to the Association, the Government will
provide the following supporting documentation (Section 4.04(b), draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement):
(i) a detailed description of the studies and work to be carried
out in connection with the proposed sub-project, including
the purposes and objectives of the proposed sub-project
and the benefits expected from each sub-project;
(ii) information regarding the qualifications, terms of refer-
ence and duration of service for any experts or consultants
to be engaged in carrying out the proposed sub-project;
(iii) a description of the functions of the agency or agencies
or personnel of the Borrower to be responsible for the
execution of the proposed sub-project;
(iv) estimates of the foreign and local costs of the proposed
sub-project broken down by major items and showing amounts
to be financed by the Borrower and out of the proceeds of
the credit, respectively, and an estimated disbursement
schedule; and
(v) a description of the measures to be taken regarding
arrangements for appointment of qualified counterparts.
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       The Government would recruit the experts to be funded under the
project, with the Association providing assistance as required. The quali-
fications, experience and terms and conditions of employment of the experts
would be satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.03(a), draft Development



- 15 -
Credit Agreement). For contracts exceeding US$100,000 in value, the Govern-
ment would furnish the Association a copy of the proposed contract for prior
review and concurrence. To minimize recruitment difficulties, the Government
expects to follow a two-step approach for recruiting the proposed expert
services. The senior expert in the PPU (see para. 32) would be recruited
initially and he in turn would actively assist in the recruitment of additional
experts for the PPU and experts in the operational ministries.
39.       The consultants would have qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.03(a),
draft Development Credit Agreement). Contracts exceeding US$100,000 in value
would be furnished to the Association for prior review and approval. Con-
tracts for the purchase of goods to be financed out of the proceeds of the
credit shall be let on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally,
in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Association.
40.       The Association would disburse against 100 percent of foreign ex-
penditures and 80 percent of local expenditures for experts and consultants
services, training, equipment and supplies and operating costs.
Project Duration and Reports
41.       The project would cover the period of the Third National Development
Plan (1979-83). Since most experts financed through the project would be
recruited in 1979/80, their contracts would have a three-year duration. The
project should be completed by December 31, 1983. The PPU would prepare,
not later than September 30 of each year, a detailed annual work program
setting forth its proposed project preparation and monitoring activities dur-
ing the following fiscal year. The proposed work program would be furnished
to the Association for review by October 31 of each year. The Planning Com-
mission would be responsible for preparing an annual report by August 31 of
each year beginning in 1980, and continuing until project completion, setting
out (i) the status of all project preparation activities financed with the
proceeds of the credit, and (ii) the status of all projects prepared with the
proceeds of this credit and being executed under the Third Plan (Section 5.01,
draft Development Credit Agreement). The Government would prepare and furnish
to the Association an evaluation report following project completion (Section
4.06(c), draft Development Credit Agreement).
Benefits and Risks
42.       The project would help the Zambian Government achieve its invest-
ment objectives in the Third National Development Plan (1979-83) by provid-
ings.assistance to strengthen planning and project preparation. Long-term
expert assistance would help the Planning Commission and operational min-
istries overcome critical shortages of experienced planners and project
analysts which in the past have hindered the formulation and preparation of
sectoral plans and projects. The short- and medium-term consultant services
financed by the credit would enable the Government to carry out essential
pre-investment work on high priority projects. Counterpart training would



- 16 -
provide Zambians with valuable experience in economic planning and project
preparation work. An important benefit would be the improved availability
of high priority projects ready for external financing. The project would
also enable the Government to more effectively identify its technical assis-
tance requirements and utilize offers of such assistance from bilateral,
multilateral and private sources. The project's main risk is in recruiting
long-term experts. The Government's internal machinery for recruiting highly
qualified experts does not operate quickly or efficiently. Moreover, the
unsettled conditions prevailing in southern Africa complicates recruitment
of qualified expatriates whose services are in high demand elsewhere in the
developing world. To facilitate recruitment, the Association would assist the
Government in finding suitable candidates for the position of senior expert in
the PPU (para. 38). The senior expert in turn would help the Government
recruit other experts financed by the credit.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Zambia and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
44.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III of this report.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

ANNEX II
B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 592-ZA First Education Project: US$17.4 million loan of
April 11, 1969, Effective Date: July 15, 1969;
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
Due to prolonged negotiations with architectural consultants,
budgetary constraints in both 1972 and 1977 resulting from low copper prices,
poor management in the early stages of project implementation, and more
recently shortages of construction materials and financial difficulties of
several major contractors, the project is about four and a half years behind
schedule. Latest estimates indicate an increase in cost of about 17 percent
which is manageable. Educational objectives in quantitative terms are being
met, while qualitative changes of content of education have not yet been
achieved. Some problems with respect to defects in materials used in con-
struction of project secondary schools have recently emerged and are being
closely monitored.
Loan No. 645-ZA      Second Education Project:  US$5.3 million loan of
November 20, 1969; Effective Date: May 5, 1970;
Closing Date: March 31, 1979
The project as originally approved has been completed satisfactorily
with the exception of finalization of accounting. Due to contributions of
instructional equipment by bilateral donor agencies, savings in the loan
proceeds of about US$1.0 million were realized. As a result, the Government
requested an amendment, which was approved by the Bank, to the Loan Agreement
for additional work at the University to utilize these savings and also enable
the postponement of the Closing Date by two years to March 31, 1978. However,
delays in the procurement of furniture and equipment for the project items
included in the amendment and in the transfer of farm lands to the University
necessitated a further extension of the Closing Date to March 31, 1979.
Loan No. 701-ZA      Kariba North Hydroelectric Project:  US$82.1 million loans
of July 29, 1970 and August 16, 1974: Effective Date:
December 16, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The power station has been in full operation since May 1977.
Recently the thrust bearings of two of the four 150-MW units failed, and are
undergoing repair; one is still under the manufacturer's guarantee, while the
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
other is covered by insurance. The two units are expected to be in operation
again shortly. The Central African Power Corporation (CAPC) is fully respon-
sible for operation of the power station. Staffing of the power station was
initially problematic but an adequate number of experienced staff were
recruited and are now at site. A project completion report is being prepared.
Loan No. 882-ZA      Integrated Family Farming Project:  US$11.5 million loan of
February 28, 1973; Effective Date: July 26, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is experiencing difficulties. Management at head-
quarters and scheme level is unsatisfactory. Slower than expected recruitment
of project farmers, together with inflation, have precipitated sharp increases
in settlement cost per farmer. These developments are threatening the eco-
nomic viability of the project. However, because of satisfactory yields
(tobacco and maize) and government subsidies, financial returns to farmers are
good. In addition to visiting consultants, the Tobacco Management Board of
Zambia (TBZ) has recently selected a new Project Manager to replace the one
who resigned in November 1976. However, two expatriate staff, the Extension/
Training Officer and the Financial Controller, may soon leave Zambia if TBZ's
efforts to gain government approval to increase their remuneration are not
successful. It is hoped that ODM would agree to top up their salaries. The
Bank is following this matter closely.
Loan No. 900-ZA      Third Education Project:  US$33.0 million loan of
June 6, 1973; Effective Date: August 9, 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979
Project implementation is generally proceeding satisfactorily.
Government's decision to locate the agricultural campus in Solwezi, which in
effect deleted the construction and equipping of a Faculty of Agricultural
Sciences at the Lusaka campus, as well as the devaluation of the kwacha and
savings from the equipment category, have given rise to expected savings of
about K 4 million. Requests by the Government of Zambia for the utilization
of some of these savings in other areas are under consideration. The project
is expected to be completed by March 1979, six months earlier than the closing
date.
Loan No. 919-ZA      Kafue Hydroelectric Project (Stage II):  US$115.0 million
loan of July 16, 1973; Effective Date: January 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The two 150-MW units at the Kafue Gorge power station were commis-
sioned in mid-1977. Construction of the main dam has been completed and the
reservoir filled. The project is expected to be completed within the
appraisal cost estimates. Power availability has not been up to expectations
because of unexpected breakdowns at the power station, but the problems are
now under control. Appropriate maintenance procedures also are being intro-
duced. The Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) financial perfor-
mance has not been satisfactory, but an appropriate tariff increase is now



- 26 -
ANNEX II
under consideration. Largely because of the economic recession affecting
Zambia, ZESCO has been experiencing a shortage of spare parts and the depar-
ture of some expatriate staff.
Loan No. 1057-ZA    Lusaka Squatter Upgrading and Site and Services Project:
US$20.0 million loan of December 6, 1974; Effective
Date: April 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Implementation of the project is slower than anticipated because
of delays in land acquisition and difficulties in providing construction
materials and spare parts due to Zambia's foreign exchange shortage. Upgrad-
ing of the first major squatter settlement in Chawama has been completed, and
construction and improvement of houses is progressing satisfactorily. Provi-
sion of services in various new sites is in full swing and construction of
houses in these sites should start soon. At present, arrears in building
materials loans are very high but Government is taking appropriate measures to
reduce these to a realistic level.
Loan No. 1131-ZA    Telecommunications Project:  US$32.0 million loan of
June 24, 1975; Effective Date: December 10, 1975
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Project procurement and execution are approximately one year behind
schedule but recently have been proceeding satisfactorily. Contracts for
switching equipment and microwave and radio systems have been awarded.
Implementation, however, may slowdown considerably as a result of government
budgetary constraints. An increase in telecommunications tariffs has been
approved by Government, and arrears and delays in billing have been reduced.
Implementation of the financial/management consultants report is proceeding
satisfactorily. Implementation of the initial capitalization of the recently
formed Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, however, still remains to be
completed.
Loan No. 1210-ZA    Development Bank of Zambia:  US$15.0 million loan of
February 18, 1976; Effective Date: April 23, 1976;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980
The loan has been committed to the extent of about US$5.5 million
equivalent for a number of projects in various industries such as chemicals,
textiles, packaging, agriculture and food processing. The low level of
commitments is mainly due to a slower pace of operations than anticipated at
appraisal, due to the serious economic recession in the country.
Loan No. 1356-ZA    Fourth Education Project:  US$13.3 million loan of
January 17, 1977; Effective Date: March 8, 1977;
Closing Date: March 31, 1983
The project has made a very good start with two of its components
(the Educational Services Center and the Evelyn Hone College) progressing
ahead of schedule. Budgetary constraints in 1977 have affected procurement
of equipment as well as the overall progress of the project.

Loan No. 1424-ZA    Second Industrial Forestry Project:  US$16.8 million loan
of May 12, 1977; Effective Date: November 15, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Project implementation has started well despite some problems
with staffing, equipment and spare parts. Planting targets are being met very
well and while there are some handicaps caused by a lack of equipment in good
running order, no serious difficulties have yet been encountered.
Loan No. 1566-ZA
and
Credit 798-ZA Third Highway Project: US$22.5 million (US$11.25 million
loan and US$11.25 million credit) of June 27, 1978;

The loan and credit are expected to become effective by December 29,
1978.

ANNEX V
CONSULTANT STUDIES
The Government has identified the following agro-industrial projects
and given them a high priority in the Third Plan. To prepare these projects
for financing, consultant services are required for additional feasibility
studies. These are only a few of many high priority projects which will re-
quire additional studies to prepare them for implementation during the Third
Plan (1979-83).
(1) Agricultural Development Bank
The Ministry of Lands and Agriculture wishes to transfer the Agri-
cultural Finance Corporation (AFC), which at present provides loans for agri-
cultural projects, into a bank capable of establishing commercial operations
in predominantly agricultural areas. By this transformation, the MLA would
expect to mobilize additional local resources which could be recycled into a
higher volume of agricultural lending, and result in additional agricultural
production. Consultant services are needed to advise the Government on the
necessary procedures to restructure the AFC into the Agricultural Development
Bank, and to recommend on the scope, size, marketing approach and operational
procedures which the new bank should adopt to become effective.
(2) Vegetable Oil Production from Maize Germ and Soya Beans
A project is under consideration to utilize the substantial amount
of vegetable oil contained in the germ of the maize produced in Zambia, and
not now recovered. The same facilities to be constructed for the extraction
of maize oil could, at the same time, be used to extract the oil and meal
from soybeans. The project would be structured so that the extracted maize
germ would be recycled back into the maize meal in order to maintain the
latter's protein content. In order to facilitate this recycling process,
the project would consist of two plants, one to the north and one to the
south of Lusaka, located near the main maize mills. Consultant services are
required to undertake the full feasibility study of this project including
a marketing analysis, technical evaluation and economic justification.
(3) Fodder Yeast and Alcohol Production from Molasses
A project has been prepared to utilize the almost 40,000 metric
tons of molasses produced yearly by the Nakambala sugar plant, for the manu-
facture of high protein fodder yeast and alcohol. Yearly production would
be more than 8,000 metric tons of yeast, which is equivalent to an equal
amount of soybean or groundnut meal, currently valued, conservatively, at
US$3 million. Furthermore, the plant would supply fully the country's alco-
hol demand, both for industrial and personal consumption purposes. Con-
sultant services are required to update project preparation and to review
project costs.



- 33 -
ANNEX V
(4) A Fruit and Vegetable Processing Plant
Consultant services are required to assist in the preparation of a
project to produce fruit and vegetable products. The project would have four
separate components: two of these components, a large-scale general canning
plant and a citrus operation, have to be started as new ventures; the other
two components, strengthening of the pineapple cannery in Mwinilunga and an
increase in mango juice processing, are expansions of existing operations.
Total investment in the enterprise, including a multi-product canning plant
as well as a large farm, is estimated at over US$16 million. The project
would produce more than 5,000 metric tons per year of net product once full
capacity utilization has been achieved.
(5) Fish Processing, Freezing, and Distribution
A project for fish processing, freezing and distribution has been
identified. The project would include fish processing, freezing and dis-
tribution centers at Nsumbu, Kampinda, Kashikishi, and on the Kafue and
Upper Zambezi rivers. Ice manufacturing facilities would be located on lakes
Mweru-wa-ntipa, Mweru-Luapula, and Bangweulu and in the Kafue, Upper Zambezi
and Lukanga fisheries. Fish handling facilities at Kitwe would be renovated.
Access roads to northern fisheries areas would be improved. The overall pro-
duct should also include enhanced fisheries extension, training and credit
programs, service centers to supply the needs of fishermen, and expansion of
the capacity of the fishery input supply industry to meet the requirements of
fishermen. Investment costs for the processing, freezing, distribution and
access roads parts of the project have been estimated roughly at about US$20
million. Studies are required on the project's technical and marketing as-
pects, management arrangements and economic justification.
(6) Cashew Development
The Government is considering a cashew production project in an
effort to improve agricultural exports. Cashewnut production has been pro-
pagated as a smallholder crop since the early seventies in the Western Pro-
vince. In the absence of a remunerative domestic market, cashew kernels
will have to be exported, and in the foreign market these Zambian cashew
kernels will have to compete with Mozambican or Tanzanian kernels that are
processed in large-scale mechanical decortication plants. Manual processing
of cashewnuts is prohibitively expensive in Zambia and elsewhere in Africa.
Moreover, in order to feed a minimum economic scale cashew processing plant,
an amount of at least 5,000 metric tons yearly is required. The current
program of cashew propagation in Western Province will not generate such an
amount in the foreseeable future. Agricultural experts are required to
examine the cultivation potential for cashews in the Western Province to de-
termine if production can be increased economically to justify an investment
project. The project will also require feasibility studies to determine mar-
keting and management arrangements.

ANNEX VI
Terms of Reference for Project Preparation Unit
and Working Groups for Sub-Projects
Purpose
1.        The Project Preparation Unit (PPU) of the Planning Commission will
ascertain the need for preparation of high priority projects and will be con-
cerned with the administration of the funds earmarked to finance project
preparation work and the provision of technical assistance in the execution
of such work. In the cases involving short or medium term consultancy ser-
vices to be financed under the project, the PPU and the operational ministry
or agency concerned will organize a working group for the formulation and
implementation of the particular proposal. The working group would have the
following organization and functions:
A.   Organization and Staffing - Working Groups
The Project Preparation Unit will organize informal Working
Groups for work on individual projects involving the proposed
use of consultancy services funded under the credit. Its
staff will include:
(a) staff of the PPU;
(b) staff of the operational ministry or agency; and
(c) secretarial and support staff.
B.   Procedure for Project Analysis
Working Groups will be established for high priority projects
which will require consultancy services to assist with pre-
paration. The Working Group will determine the nature and
scope of the studies required to prepare the project for
financing, will help to draw up terms of reference for those
studies and a schedule for their execution, will submit the
proposal to the Association for agreement, and will help to
supervise the execution and evaluation of the studies. Re-
quirements for coordination with other ministries and agencies
would be identified and agreed with those agencies. If a
financing organization or agency has already been tentatively
identified, it would be consulted about the preparation require-
ments. The Working Group will assist in evaluating proposals
made for studies and in negotiating contracts pertaining to the
studies.

ANNEX VI
C.   Supervision of Project Preparation Studies
The Working Group will assist in the technical supervision
of studies being executed, will review progress reports,
arrange for prospective financing agencies to be kept in-
formed of the progress and assist in evaluating the studies
on completion.
D.   Terms of Reference for Consultants Services
In drawing up terms of reference for consultant services, the
Working Group will ensure that the project is analyzed in all
its facets and made ready for appraisal by a financing agency.
The scope of the studies required will vary, depending on the
nature of the preparatory work done prior to submission of the
project to the Working Group. It will be the Working Group's
task to ensure that all the available alternative solutions
to an investment need are appropriately analyzed. The studies
will, if necessary, extend to market analysis of investment
and operating costs, the legal, fiscal and financial conditions,
and management, organization and manpower requirements. These
studies should also include analysis of the economics of the
project, as well as financial viability, and social cost-benefit
analysis and environmental consideration as appropriate. The
project studies will address the possible problems of implement-
ing the project which may emerge and will propose solutions to
overcome them.
