MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO ALBANIA
FOR AN AGRO-PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Albania for SDR 4.1 million (US$ 6.0 million equivalent), on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity, to help finance a project to support the development of the agro-processing sector
and to help improve the conditions for financing its restructuring through the financial sector.
2.    Background. With a population of 3.2 million, by far the poorest country in Europe, Albania
is predominantly an agricultural society. The agriculture sector's contribution to GDP was close to 35%
during the 1980s and reached about 50% in 1992 due to the sharp decline in industrial output.
Livestock-with a population of over 743,300 cattle (including 400,300 dairy cows) and 3.4 million sheep
and goats-accounts for almost half of the GDP added by agriculture (of which almost half by the dairy
sector). Prior to recent reforms, all agricultural land was state-owned or clustered into state dominated
agricultural 'cooperatives," and input and output marketing, including all milk collection and distribution
activities, were controlled by state enterprises. Almost all of the land (and livestock) of the cooperatives
and state farms have now been privatized. These reforms have created small farm holdings with about
422,000 farm families, each having 0.8 to 3.3 ha of land (average 1.7 ha), I to 3 cows, and a few to
sheep and goats; in addition, there are some 30,000 rural families without land.
3.    Recently, the number of cattle has increased and average milk yield is improving but still low at
about 1,600 kg. All farms are mixed, producing both crops and animal products. However, the farmers
have begun to produce surplus in addition to meeting their subsistence needs. They are eager to market
this surplus to generate cash. The main products with cash value in the town markets at present are milk,
meat and vegetables. However, the farmers are finding it very difficult to market their products due to
the lack of adequate processing and marketing facilities. This is causing shortages of milk and other
products in the urban areas, while at the same time wastage of products at the farm, and it is discouraging
farmers from increasing farm production. While there is still wide-spread resentment against cooperatives
due to their past state-controlled practices, some farmers have begun to organize private farmers
associations (PFAs) for input and marketing purposes; so far some 100 PFAs have been registered, with
membership of about 4,000 families.
4.    The Albanian agro-processing industry includes some 200 large enterprises, 550 small scale
dairies and several hundred small bakeries. Output fell 35 percent between 1990 and 1991, and a
majority of the enterprises have been closed. Most of technology is obsolete, because there has been no
investment for 20 years, even for necessary spare parts, and only the creativity and skills of Albanian
mechanical engineers have kept the factories operating. Production efficiencies and productivity are low,
and even minimum hygienic and sanitation standards are not met. Most industry personnel also lack
modern industrial skills and do not have a comprehensive technical education. The technical/research
institutions supporting the sector are not well equipped in terms of laboratory facilities and modern staff
skills. The process of privatization of agro-industries has been slow, due in part to high asking prices
and lack of cash on the part of potential investors. The Government is now implementing a mass
privatization plan to expedite privatization of state enterprises. While there is substantial interest in the
sector, several factors are hindering its development, including lack of adequate business management



2
and marketing skills, lack of exposure to modern technology and operational techniques, lack of seed
capital required by the banks for borrowing, shortage of long term credit, and lack of collateral property.
5.      In agro-processing, dairy represents a major part of the sector, comprising almost 10 percent
of GDP and up to 60 percent of farm incomes. The state-run milk collection and distribution system
collapsed in 1992. While total milk production (780,000 tons in 1994) has continued to increase after
the land reforms, milk supply to the dairy processing industry has decreased dramatically from 191,000
tons in 1989 to 20,000 tons in 1994. Until 1991, between 30% to 40% of the total quantity of milk
produced was delivered to the processing industry (25 state-owned dairy processing plants and some 565
small cheese plants) for the production of pasteurized milk, butter, cheese and other milk products for
urban consumption. Supply of pasteurized milk to the urban consumers has stopped since 1992, and it
has become very difficult for farmers to market milk. Whatever fresh milk is available to the urban
population is being supplied by the farmers directly on the basis of contacts with individual families and
on the city streets. This has led to quality deterioration from adulteration and poor handling conditions.
Non-availability of milk and other inputs and spare parts to factories have resulted in either the closure
of most dairy plants or very low level of operations (processing I to 2 tons of milk per day, i.e., only
5% to 10% of their installed capacity), resulting in high processing costs. A number of cheese plants
have been destroyed, and only about 100 plants that have been privatized continue to operate at this time.
Recently, a few new cheese and ice cream making units have come into existence.
6.     Sector Strategy. The Government's overall objectives in the agriculture sector include: sustained
growth through improvements in yields and productivity; conversion from subsistence agriculture towards
marketing of surplus to domestic and export markets; reduction of rural poverty and prevention of rural-
urban migration through creation of productive employment opportunities in rural areas; and food
security. The Government recognizes that in order to improve farm productivity and rural incomes, the
agro-processing and marketing of farm outputs has to significantly improve. The dairy sector affects a
wide part of the rural farming population as well as urban consumers. On the farm, dairy provides a
daily cash flow throughout the year and is, therefore, a very attractive option to generate rural incomes.
In many Eastern European countries including Albania, it becomes one of the most important components
of the informal "social safety net" of laid off workers and farmers. Furthermore, it improves the
nutrition of the rural population and allows home based or small-scale processing that opens up the
market and thus creates independence from state monopolies.
7.    IDA Experience in Albania. The proposed credit would be the Association's first full-scale
operation in the agro-processing sector. Some experience in Albania's agro-processing sector arises from
IDA's Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC) in Albania. ASAC provides, inter alia, a line of
credit of US$5.0 million for the agriculture sector. Initial experience under ASAC indicated that the
Rural Commercial Bank's institutional and financial capacity is limited. Another lesson is the need to
strengthen local project management capabilities for effective project implementation; and that foreign
technical assistance should be limited to quality personnel in essential areas where skills in Albania are
weak or nonexistent, and the use of Albanian counterparts should be maximized. The proposed project
has attempted to include in its design these important lessons.
8.    Rationalefor IDA Involvement. The proposed project closely reflects the development priorities
formulated in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS-Report No. P-6058-ALB), which was discussed
by the Board on September 14, 1993. According to the CAS, support for the development of private
agriculture, which is Albania's most important sector, is an area of priority. The CAS called generally
for flexible programs that promote "new entrepreneurship and private enterprise," and it specifically cited



3
the collapse of agro-processing enterprises and the weakness of new, emerging private activities. The
project would promote private entrepreneurship and would form part of IDA's overall development
strategy for the agriculture sector, which was jointly formulated in October 1992 by the Bank, the EU,
and GOA. It would build on the reforms undertaken by GOA in the agriculture sector. By addressing
critical agro-products marketing issues in rural areas, the project would make a contribution towards the
development of the rural economy. It would also complement other IDA projects in agriculture and the
rural sector, particularly the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project and follow-up Rural Development
Project, which focus on improving rural incomes and farm production; the ASAC, which supports various
policy and institutional reforms in the agriculture sector, including the privatization of agro-industrial
enterprises; and the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, which supports, inter alia, an increase in fodder
production.
9.     Project Objectives. The main objective of the proposed project is to support the development of
the agro-processing sector and to help improve the conditions for financing its restructuring through the
financial sector in order to improve marketing of farm products (thereby improving rural incomes) and
availability of food products to urban consumer.
10.   Project Justification. In the absence of project-supported activities, marketing constraints in
Albania would become even more acute, preventing farm production increases from improved irrigation
and other factors, and limiting the farm surplus made available for sale. There is already evidence that
milk and other farm products are being wasted because of lack of marketing and processing facilities, and
the situation is likely to worsen without the project. In the absence of improved marketing and processing
facilities, the farmers would be forced to limit their production to subsistence levels only, thereby leading
to continued shortages of milk and other processed products in urban areas. It is quite evident from
ongoing experience that the project is needed to "make things happen." The project has been designed
with the objective of putting a minimum burden on the government budget and to sustain itself in the long
run without continuing government support. Several alternatives were considered before arriving at the
proposed project design. Given the importance of the agro-processing sector in the Albanian economy,
the need for substantial assistance, lack of private sector alternatives, and low paying capacity of
emerging entrepreneurs, the initial public investment in technical assistance is well justified for a period
of 2-3 years. In the long run, such activity is expected to be taken over by the private sector.
11.   Project Description.  The project would be carried out over 3 years and would have two
components-an Entrepreneurs Support component and an Investment (Credit) component. The IDA
Credit would be made to the Government, which would onlend the Investment component, under a
subsidiary loan agreement, to the Rural Commercial Bank; the Ministry of Agriculture and Food would
implement the Entrepreneurs Support component. The project design is flexible, with a provision to fine-
tune it as experience is gained during implementation.
12.   Investment Component (US$5.0 million) would provide a general line of credit for onlending to
the agricultural sector at market rates for long-term loans (and incremental working capital). The project
technical assistance would emphasize investments for on farm efficiency improvements, rehabilitation of
existing plants and establishment of new small and rural or urban-based processing units, marketing,
service and related enterprises. Some 15-20 private agro-processing/dairy enterprises, and a number of
other agriculture entrepreneurs, farmers and their associations are expected to benefit under the project.
13.   Entrepreneurs Support Component (US$2.1 million) would aim to fully utilize skills available in
the country and would strengthen them with outside expertise where necessary. Focus would be on



4
providing direct assistance/training to potential agro-processing entrepreneurs, farmers, and farmers'
associations on preparing bankable investment projects as well as on business management and technical
matters. For this purpose, a Technical Services Unit (TSU) has been established, which would have
foreign and Albanian experts. The TSU would provide assistance to farmers in organizing private
farmers associations and in improving their operations. Assistance would also be provided for the limited
strengthening of local technical institutions engaged in providing technical services (including quality
control enforcement) to industry. In addition, assistance would be provided to the RCB in the appraisal
and supervision of sub-projects. The Netherlands Government would provide cofinancing of US$1.0
million for this component.
14.    Onlending Arrangements. IDA funds would be onlent by the Government to the RCB in US
dollars at LIBOR plus 0.5% with up to ten years maturity. The RCB would onlend to private enterprises
at market rates and would carry full risk. The Independent Lending Unit (ILU) of the RCB, which was
established under ASAC, would process loans carrying out appraisal and approval decisions as well as
supervision. It would seek the advice of TSU on the technical merits of the sub-projects. For sub-
projects in remote areas and for PFA's, the RCB would receive, based on agreed criteria, an incentive
bonus (2%) towards defraying higher transaction costs associated with processing such scattered projects,
which are difficult to evaluate and monitor since they depend so much on both upstream and downstream
linkages.
15.   The sub-loans to sub-borrowers would be offered in both foreign currency and Leks at market
rates. Foreign exchange risk on Lek sub-loans would be borne by the RCB and foreign exchange risk
on foreign currency sub-loans would be borne by the sub-borrowers. Maximum sub-loan size would be
$250,000 with a maximum exposure of $400,000 to any single sub-borrower; in special cases, exceptions
to this limit could be granted with IDA approval. The sub-loans would have up to seven years maturity
with up to one year grace period. At least 50% of the funds would be reserved for sub-loans of maturity
of four years or longer. Sub-loans would be evaluated on the basis of the business merits of the sub-
projects supported by a business plan. Further evaluation criteria would include available collateral and
environmental impact of sub-projects. Sub-loans of US$200,000 and above would be subject to IDA's
prior review. Eligible sub-projects shall have a financial rate of return of at least 12% in real terms.
Sub-borrowers would normally provide at least 20 percent of the total sub-project costs. In exceptional
cases (e.g., small entrepreneurs, plant workers, PFAs), the sub-borrowers may receive sub-loans of up
to 100 percent of the sub-project costs, subject to IDA prior approval; such exceptions are not expected
to exceed 10% of the total credit amount.
16.   Project Implementation and Sustainabillty. The MAF would take overall responsibility for the
project with the Director of the Agro-Processing Department (APD), working through the TSU,
responsible for the execution of the Entrepreneurs Support component. The RCB would implement the
Investment component. Existing technical institutes would play an important role in providing quality
control and technical services (on a fee basis) to private entrepreneurs including feasibility studies,
technical advice, and training. Private sector's advice would be sought during implementation as well
as in the planning of a long-term strategy for the development of the sector. In this context, appropriate
assistance to private trade associations would be included. During the mid-term review, the status of
project implementation would be reviewed with a view to make adjustments if necessary.
17.   Project implementation and day-to-day activities of the project would be carried out by the TSU
without the day-to-day involvement of MAF. Foreign expertise would be engaged for TSU in areas
where no local expertise currently exits. The Albanian professional counterparts would be trained in all



5
aspects of project implementation, and towards the end of the project they would take over project
management from the consultant firm. TSU's responsibilities would include providing training to
entrepreneurs and organizing and helping with the establishment of PFAs. The TSU would provide direct
assistance to entrepreneurs (and their associations) in project promotion and entrepreneurial development,
including helping them in the preparation of business plans, identifying appropriate equipment supplies,
providing technical advice, and preparing profiles for typical sub-projects. The TSU would also assist
technical institutions in developing their capacity in industry-related problem solving, including
developing training courses and implementing training of trainers as well as improving enforcement of
quality control laws. In the long run, the TSU is expected to be converted into a private entity supported
by industry without continuing burden on Government budget, or be wound up at the end of the project.
18.   Actions Agreed. The following agreements have been reached at negotiations: (i) the ILU
(RCB) would appraise and approve sub-loans with RCB carrying full credit risk; (ii) commitments in
excess of US$2.5 million under the Investment component would be made by the RCB only if the RCB
has maintained satisfactory collection rates on sub-loans made under the ASAC and under the proposed
project; (iii) the GOA/RCB would prepare by December 31, 1996, and implement a satisfactory financial
restructuring and privatization plan for the RCB, as agreed under the EFSAC project; (iv) the MAF
would maintain the TSU and APD under satisfactory terms and conditions during the project; and (v)
before the mid-term review, the GOA would prepare a strategy for the promotion of PFAs. Conditions
of Effectiveness would be: (i) the signing of a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement between the MOF
and the RCB; and (ii) effectiveness of the Netherlands Grant Agreement.
19.   Environmental Aspects. The project has been reviewed by the Regional Environmental Division
and assigned category "B" consistent with the provisions of OD 4.01. In the agro-processing sector, most
works would involve simple rehabilitation of existing infrastructure (and improvement of plant systems),
which would generally have a beneficial environmental impact. It should be noted that the rehabilitation
of agro-processing plants would continue to create a certain level of pollution in the disposal of plant
effluents to the ditches/rivers, since neither the city nor the plants at present have any waste treatment
facilities. The TSU's foreign firm would assist GOA in reviewing food plant effluent standards as well
as in developing an action program to ensure that relevant government agencies monitor compliance. The
ILU would review sub-projects for compliance with Albanian Environmental legislation and World Bank
environmental guidelines.
20.    Program Objective Category. Although the project does not contain specific mechanisms for
targeting the least well off, it is expected, given the nature of the project, that the project beneficiaries
would include a significant size of the poor population. Major beneficiaries of the project are expected
to be farmers who are generally poor. Consequently, the project is rated as "Poverty Category: Program
for Targeted Interventions," in accordance with the provisions of OD 4.15.
21.    Participatory Approach. The project emphasizes participation by the beneficiaries. In the design
of the project, views of private entrepreneurs and other stockholders have been taken into account.
During project implementation, continuous dialogue with stakeholders would be maintained, and feedback
would be used to adjust project activities as necessary.
22.   Benefits. The project would contribute several benefits to the Albanian economy. It would
promote restructuring of the agro-processing sector. As stated above, it is expected to help improve rural
incomes by putting in place a market access to farmers to sell their surplus farm products such as fruits,
vegetables, meat, and milk, thereby reducing their wastage and generating regular cash. Milk provides



6
a daily cash flow throughout the year without excessive borrowing, and as such empowers women. It
tempers some of the seasonality in cash availability in rural areas, which could lead to poverty reduction
as well as an overall better diet in rural and urban areas. Access to markets would also result in
improved farm production. The urban consumer would receive supply of quality processed food
products. It would make strides in institution-building by improving private entrepreneurship and human
capital through training, technical education, and advice. Organization of PFAs would have several
indirect benefits, such as establishment of systems to supply farm inputs, better product handling
techniques, and improved marketing by pooling products. Improvements in the quality control system
would also have a positive impact on food production and nutritional intake. Application of project
evaluation techniques, including financial rates of return, would ensure that only commercially viable
investments are supported; all sub-projects would have at least 12% rate of return in real terms. Given
the liberalized prices of most agro-products, open international trade with low tariffs, and market based
foreign exchange rates, the prevailing domestic prices in Albania reflect border prices. Thus, the
economic returns on the investments to be financed are expected to be either equal to or higher than their
financial returns.
23.   Risks. The project would carry significant risks. Given limited Albanian institutional capacity,
the implementation may be slow; this risk would be mitigated by the establishment of a TSU with experts
from an experienced foreign firm. Privatization of plants may not succeed as fast as needed; the issue
of privatization is being addressed under ASAC with appropriate policy conditionalities. The demand
for processed products may be less than expected, given tight economic conditions and high
unemployment rates; this risk is considered low given that processed products are still scarce in Albania
and a substantial part of demand is still not being met at this stage, and economic conditions are expected
to improve. The private entrepreneurs may be reluctant to borrow loans at markets rates; but this is
considered unlikely because discussions with private and public sector have revealed strong demand for
loans. The other major risk would be the institutional and financial capacity of the RCB to be able to
service loans and monitor their performance; this risk is being addressed under ASAC and EFSAC
projects with the provision of appropriate technical assistance and conditionality for the
privatization/restructuring of the RCB. In addition, the ILU, which would continue to be responsible for
the appraisal and supervision of sub-loans, would receive necessary technical assistance under the project.
While the risks are significant, the project design includes specific steps to manage them.
24.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
