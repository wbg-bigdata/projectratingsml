INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF SECOND FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT - PUSRI III
SUM4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Govetnment of Indonesia has asked the Bank to help finance a
fertilizer plant with capacities of 1,000 tons per day (TPD) of ammonia, all
to be converted into 1,725 TPD of urea and to be executed by P. T. Pupuk
Sriwidjaja (PUSRI), a limited liability company whose shares are exclusively
held by the Government. This report recommends a Bank loan to the Govern-
ment of US$115 million to meet 60% of the total estimated financing required
for the project of about US$192 million, or 73% of the estimated foreign ex-
change cost of about US$157.6 million. The balance (40%) of the financing,
amounting to US$42.6 million equivalent in foreign exchange and US$34.4 mil-
lion in local currency would be contributed by the Government as equity. The
Government would on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan for 15-1/2 years in-
cluding 3-1/2 years of grace, at 12% annual interest including a 3-1/2% fee
accruing to the Government which will bear the foreign exchange risk.
ii.       The project will constitute the second expansion of the Company's
plant located at Palembang in South Sumatra on the Musi River and be adjacent
to the IDA-assisted first expansion project (Credit 193-IND of June 15, 1970),
UTSRI II, which was mechanically completed one month ahead of the contract sched-
ule in September 1974 with only a minor cost overrun. The plant which will use
gas as feedstock to be supplied through a system already installed as part of
the earlier IDA project would more than double PUSRI's annual urea production
capacity and is expected to be in commercial operation by May 1977.
iii.      Given the rapid increase in Indonesia's urea consumption, the
high escalation in equipment prices and the fact that Indonesia with its
substantial resources of natural gas has a comparative advantage in pro-
ducing nitrogenous fertilizer such as urea, there are important benefits
in speedy project implementation. The Government, therefore, requested,
and the Bank agreed, that the Company be permitted to continue to use the
same engineering firms as for PUSRI II, which were approved by IDA and which
have performed satisfactorily. Procurement of critical long-delivery items
was begun in May 1974; they are being financed from foreign exchange made
available by the Government and no retroactive financing from the Bank loan
is required. Biddlers' lists and proposed awards for major equipment supply
contracts have beebn reviewed by the Bank and all major equipment items are
being procured following Bank guidelines, irrespective of the source of
finance.
iv.       Over the past 10 years (1964-1974), Indonesia's nitrogen fertilizer
consumption has increased at an average annual rate of about 15% reaching in
1974 about 414,001) nutrient tons of which nearly 75% had to be imported.
wZhile this reflects considerably higher use than had been expected in 1970,



the 1974 fertilizer consumption understates actual demand since extensive
shortages forced the Government to resort to rationing and distribution con-
trols since the last quarter of 1973. Future consumption is conservatively
estimated to grow at about 11% per year (1972-80) and reach by 1980 about
676,000 tons of N, equivalent to some 1.5 million tons of urea. Indonesia
has one fertilizer plant now under construction and another at an advanced
stage of consideration. By 1980, it should have become self-sufficient in
the production of nitrogenous fertilizers and may have an exportable surplus
of less than 200,000 tons of N per year which it should be able to sell in
neighboring supply-deficit countries.
v.        PUSRI has capable management which has been able continuously to
operate its existing small 100,000 TPY urea plant in excess of rated capacity
and implement its first expansion project very satisfactorily. With the same
team of engineering firms and consultants, it is expected to perform equally
well in the proposed project. Furthermore, since the new plant will benefit
from the existing infrastructure and utilities, capital and operating costs
will be relatively lower than for a similar plant at a new site, and flexi-
bility of operations will be increased. The project's estimated production cost
and assumed sales price (US$135/ton, ex-factory) are expected to be interna-
tionally competitive with prices forecast to prevail towards the end of the
decade when supply and demand worldwide are likely to be in a better balance.
The Company's financial structure would remain satisfactory with the debt!
equity ratio projected at about 54/46 at completion of the project; and debt
service coverage would be at more than 1.5 times during the life of the loan.
The project's incremental financial return before tax is estimated at 13.8%
and is acceptable.
vi.       The economic rate of return of the project is 20% based on the
expected long-term international input-output prices in real terms. It
would remain satisfactory at about 16% under the conceivable adverse assump-
tions regarding capital and operating costs, project implementation time
and fertilizer prices. Non-quantifiable benefits, not taken into account
in the calculation of the economic return, such as substantial transfer of
industrial and management skills and contribution towards removal of nitrogen
fertilizer supply constraints, could also be attributed to the project. The
project shows annual direct gross foreign exchange savings of about US$87
million.
vii.      The project faces minimal technical and commercial risks, would
confer substantial benefits on the Indonesian economy and, based on agree-
ments summarized at the end of this report, is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$115 million equivalent.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested a Bank loan of US$115
million equivalent to finance a major portion of the estimated foreign ex-
change cost of an ammonia/urea 1/ plant for the Government-owned fertilizer
company, P.T. Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI), to be built adjacent to its existing
facilities on the bank of the Musi River at Palembang, in South Sumatra
(Map, IBRD 11220). The project, representing the Company's third stage
development (PUSRI III), will more than double PUSRI's urea capacity from
480,000 to slightly more than one million tons per year (TPY) of urea, equiv-
alent to an increase from 220,800 to 483,000 TPY of nitrogen (N). The pro-
posed project follows the successful completion in September 1974 of the
first expansion (PUSRI II) assisted by credits from: the International Dev-
elopment Association (IDA), US$35 million equivalent 2/; the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID), US$24 million; the Overseas Economic Coop-
eration Fund (OECF) of Japan, US$11.7 million equivalent; and the Asian Dev-
elopment Bank (ADB), US$10 million equivalent.
1.02      The total financing required for the project (PUSRI III) is esti-
mated at US$192 million of which the foreign exchange component is equivalent
to US$157.6 million. The proposed Bank loan to the Government, which would
be the Borrower, would cover about 73% of the foreign exchange or 60% of the
total financing required. The Government would meet the rest (40%) of the
estimated financing needed for the project as equity in its capacity as the
sole shareholder of PUSRI.
1.03      Although Indonesia has abundant low-cost natural gas to become
a leading competitive producer and exporter of nitrogenous fertilizers,
domestic production of fertilizers at present is substantially lower than
consumption. The Government has planned that PUSRI's entire production
would be for the domestic market. PUSRI's first urea plant, PUSRI I, con-
structed during the early 1960's is small by modern standards. It has a
capacity of 100,000 TPY urea compared to 380,000 TPY for PUSRI II, one of
the first generation of large-scale urea plants, and 570,000 TPY planned
for PUSRI III. All three plants are based on natural gas from nearby
fields.
1.04      The proposed project was appraised by D. E. Brown, A. R. Perram,
Y. T. Shetty and E. Tortorelli of the Industrial Projects Department and
W. Kaupisch of the East Asia and Pacific Program Department based on mis-
sions to Indones:La in June/July 1974 and November 1974.

II. THE COMPANY
A. Background
2.01      Fertilizer production in Indonesia is carried out exclusively in
the public sector. PUSRI, the country's first fertilizer company, was estab-
lished in 1959 as a wholly-owned State enterprise (P.N.) to manufacture urea.
The first plant, PUSRI I, went on stream in 1964, quickly achieving capacity
operations. In subsequent years, capacity utilization fluctuated between
84% and 99% until a rehabilitation program, carried out in 1970/71, allowed
capacity use at an average rate of 103% ever since. In 1970, the Government
changed the status of PUSRI, making it a limited liability company (P.T.)
under the Commercial Code.
2.02      PUSRI I is expected to need major revamping by 1976, after 12 years
of operation. The urea section may have to be modified or abandoned altogether
but the ammonia section could probably continue operation. This would allow
aummonia supply to a new phosphate fertilizer plant; or sale of industrial
ammonia. The Company is firming up its future plans for PUSRI I and will
present them, together with their costs, to the Bank when prepared. For the
purpose of projections, no production from PUSRI I is taken into account
beyond 1976.
2.03      PUSRI carried out its first expansion project (PUSRI II which was
assisted by IDA) during 1971-74 at a total cost of Rp 34.5 billion (US$83
million). In addition, a gas gathering and transmission system was built
as a part of the project by the Government-owned oil company, PERTAMINA, at
a cost of Rp 16.2 billion (US$39 million) to supply natural gas as feedstock.
Work on PUSRI II was originally expected to be completed by September 1973.
However, the actual project implementation began nearly a year later than
anticipated because of the time required to develop bid specifications and
to negotiate service contracts satisfactory to the lenders.
2.04      PUSRI II cost 9.6% or US$7.3 million more than originally forecast
in 1970, including US$5 million in foreign exchange, mainly on account of
currency realignments and the delay in start of project implementation men-
tioned. The gas gathering and transmission system cost eventually 2.8 times
the original cost estimate as detailed studies later showed larger gas re-
serves than the data available at the time of appraisal, so that a 90% larger
system could be built to serve not only PUSRI II but also other industrial
users in the Palembang area.  The studies also showed that a substantially
larger drilling program was required to assure deliverability before PUSRI II
went into operation. Part of the additional foreign exchange requirements
were covered by supplemental loans from IDA, AID, and OECF totalling US$12.7
million equivalent. The balance of cost increases was borne by the Govern-
ment.
2.05      Tne PUSRI II fertilizer plant was mechanically completed in September
1974, one month ahead of the revised scheduled date, passed its 15-day
performance test in October 1974, and has operated at high capacity since



- 3 -
then, producing 88,000 tons of urea up to the end of 1974. Details of the
existing facilities of PUSRI are given in Annex 2-1. Based on rapid con-
struction progress and correctly assuming the successful implementation of
PUSRI II, the Government decided in early 1974 to commence PUSRI III on the
basis that PUSRI and its engineering firms could complete an ammonia/urea
project in less time and at lower cost than any other team in Indonesia.
The Bank agreed with this conclusion and has been working with the Company
since April 1974 to expedite engineering services and procurement of critical
items, particularly equipment in short supply.
B.  Organization and Management
2.06      PUSRI is generally considered one of Indonesia's best managed
large industrial enterprises. Its management structure, in keeping with
Indonesia's Company Law, is patterned after the European two-tier model, and
has a supervising board called the Board of Commissioners (Dewan Komisaris)
and a Management Board (Direksi). The members of the Board of Commissioners
are the Director-Generals of: (i) Monetary Affairs (Ministry of Finance),
Chairman; (ii) Chemical Industries (Ministry of Industries); and (iii) Agri-
culture (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry).
2.07      Managerial responsibility for PUSRI's day-to-day operations rests
with the four-man Management Board, consisting of a President-Director and
three Directors. Members of the Management Board as in the case of the
Board of Commissioners are appointed by the Government. An organizational
chart of the Company is given in Annex 2-2.
2.08      Gen. H. Hasan Kasim (Retd.) has been President-Director of PUSRI
since 1966. The other three Directors and their respective responsibilities
are:  Mr. Kotan Pasaman, Technical and Production Director; Mr. Dalil Hasan,
Commercial Director; and Mr. A. A. Nuri, Financial Director.  Messrs. Kasim
and Pasaman are largely responsible for PUSRI's successful production record.
The financial management of the Company, however, needs strengthening with
additional qualified financial staff.  Assurances to this effect have been
received from PUSRI and the Government.  Further, as agreed under IDA Credit
No. 193-IND for PUSRI II, management appointments including those of con-
sultants are to be made in consultation with the Bank.
C.   Past Growth and Financial Results
2.09      PUSRI markets its own as well as imported fertilizers and other
agro-chemicals. Sales of its own output averaged about 103,000 TPY of urea
during 1970-1973, reflecting more than full rated capacity utilization, while
its sales of imported urea, triple superphosphate (TSP) and diammonium phos-
phate (DAP) increased more than ninefold during the same period, reaching
about 350,000 TPY of products in 1973. However, with PUSRI II now on stream,
the share of imported urea sales in the total sales of PUSRI is expected to
decline gradually. The following table shows the trend of sales volume, sales
revenue and net profit of PUSRI during 1970-1974 (Annex 2-3):

2.10      Under the current fertilizer marketing system, the Government buys
all locally-produced fertilizers at a fixed price, and sells it as well
as imported fertilizers to approved distributors including PUSRI, allowing
them a margin of about 22% on the fixed retail prices, which are also set by
the Government. Sub-distributors and retailers are permitted an additional
8% margin. In November 1974, the urea retail price was increased by 50% to
Rp 60,000 per ton (US$144.6) but is still subsidized to check food prices
in particular and the inflationary situation in general.
2.11      Though PUSRI during 1970-1973 operated its plant efficiently, it
made only a small profit or loss due to rising costs of inputs other than gas
and to low prices fixed by the Government. To rectify this situation,
the Government increased its purchase price of PUSRI-produced urea by stages
from Rp 28,220 (US$68) per ton in 1972 to about Rp 63,900 (US$154) per
ton in the last quarter of 1974.  This price, though substantially lower than
the current world prices for urea (about US$400 per ton), would be adequate
to provide sufficient revenue for PUSRI to be financially viable.  However,
under a new system of fertilizer rationing introduced in Indonesia in October
1973 to control illegal marketing in fertilizers, wholesalers became PUSRI's
agents and PUSRI had to finance the distribution of not only its own
fertilizer but also of imported fertilizers--which in 1973 accounted for
about 3-1/2 times in volume PUSRI's sales of its own fertilizer--and wait
up to 10 months to be paid for sales to farmers on the basis of vouchers
issued by the Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the State Agricultural Bank.
2.12      This situation created an extremely heavy financial burden on
PUSRI's marketing operation. Further, the Government initiated a stock-
piling program, in which PUSRI played a substantial role. As a result,
current assets exceeding US$100 million equivalent by the end of 1974 (in the



form of letters of credit, inventories, including stockpiling and receivables)
were financed exclusively by short-term borrowing mainly from BRI at an
average interest rate of 1.3% per month. These interest payments led to
losses from its marketing operation which had to be covered by further short-
term borrowing. During negotiations, the Government noted as imports are
insufficient to cover demand with the concomitant risk of black marketing,
the present distribution control and fertilizer rationing system would have
to be continued until the country's demand could be met from domestic
production. Given the predominant role PUSRI had assumed in the production,
import, distribution and marketing of fertilizer, the Company could also
not be relieved of an essentially public service function, i.e., carrying
out the Government's import and stockpiling program. The Government,
therefore, undertook to relieve PUSRI from the adverse effects of these
unprofitable activities through payments to cover the excess of interest
due to short-term debt over the operating profit of the Company's marketing
department. The shortfall for 1975 has been forecast to amount to Rp 1.4
billion (US$3.4 million equivalent) and the Government will pay this amount
in four equal installments to PUSRI on April 1, July 1, October 1 and
December 31 of 1975, respectively. Forecasts of shortfalls for every sub-
sequent year will be agreed between the Government and PUSRI by October 1
of the preceeding year. Adjustments, upwards or downwards, will be done
on the basis of PUSRI's audited accounts and the arrangement will continue
as long as the distribution control system is in effect.
2.13      This arrangement is acceptable to the Bank as long as PUSRI, as
at present, has no significant fixed assets in its marketing operation.
However, under the proposed fertilizer shipping and distribution project,
PIJSRI would acquire substantial marketing assets on which a reasonable
return would have to be earned. Part of this return would be provided by
the lower costs and greater efficiency of this system compared to the pre-
sent cost on which PUSRI's shipping and marketing margins are based. The
balance would either have to come from a reduction in current assets to a
normal level if, by the time the marketing assets are put into service, the
distribution control system has been abolished; or, if that system should
still be in force, through an adjustment in margins to reflect the cost
of short-term borrowing, or through the provision of working capital, or
a combination of both. Suitable arrangements will be made when the Bank
loan for the proposed project is negotiated later this year.

marized below:

2.15      As PUSRI I was financed entirely with Government equity, the Com-
pany had no debt to service. However, the construction of PUSRI II increased
the Company's debt steeply with a debt/equity ratio reaching 72/28 in 1973
partly because of negative or low earnings resulting from insufficient ex-
plant prices during 1970-1973 and partly because the Government delayed the
conversion of its contribution exceeding the debt limit of approximately
US$62 million equivalent for PUSRI II (imposed by the PUSRI II financing
agreement) until the full project cost was known. As a result, the entire
Government contribution was initially shown as debt. This situation has
now been rectified by the conversion of debt into equity for PUSRI II and
the provision of new equity for PUSRI III, and the debt/equity ratio reached
the satisfactory level of 45/55 by the end of 1974.
2.16      PUSRI's accounting and internal reporting system has improved
considerably with technical assistance from Price Waterhouse and Company,
but is not yet fully satisfactory. PUSRI has reaffirmed its intention to
submit promptly detailed annual and quarterly production, income and cash
flow statements, and balance sheets as well as annual audited statements and
forecasts in a form satisfactory to the Bank and to retain consultants to
further train PUSRI staff in establishing appropriate departmental and con-
solidated cost systems.

III. THE MARKET
3.01       There are three special characteristics of fertilizer consumption
in Indonesia: (a) heavy reliance on N fertilizers; (b) predominance of the
paddy (rice) crop in agriculture and total fertilizer usage; and (c) con-
centration of consumption in Java, Madura and Bali, the country's major
rice-growing region. A detailed analysis of the market for fertilizers and
the marketing system in Indonesia is provided in Arnex 3. The analysis is
based on: (i) data collected during appraisal of PUSRI III; (ii) the fore-
cast of nitrogenous fertilizer for rice made in the Bank draft report, "Irri-
gation Program Survey," (August 12, 1974); (iii) projections by the PUSRI
Marketing Department; and the following major fertilizer demand studies made
during the past four years: the National Fertilizer Study (NFS) 1/ Report
of 1972, the Feasibility Study (1973/74) for the proposed West Java Fertil-
izer Plant, 2/ and fertilizer reports (1974) by the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity (TVA). 37/
A.   Supply Prospects
3.02      Because of its abundant natural gas reserves, Indonesia has the
potential to develop its N fertilizer production facilities not only
for domestic consumption but also for exports. Indonesia had no domestic
facilities for fertilizer production prior to 1964, when PUSRI I went into
commercial operation. It was the only producer of nitrogenous fertilizers
(urea) until August 1972 when the P.N. Petrokimia Fertilizer Plant at Gresik,
East Java, was commissioned. The Petrokimia plant has a urea capacity of
45,000 TPY and an ammonium sulfate capacity of 150,000 TPY. At present,
the total annual production capacity for N fertilizer in Indonesia is
525,000 product tons (241,500 tons of N) of urea and 150,000 product tons
(31,500 tons of N) of ammonium sulfate. There is no indigenous phosphate
production, but Petrokimia is planning a project, to be completed by 1977,
to produce 200,000 TPY of triple superphosphate (TSP) or 92,000 TPY of
P205 based on imported rock phosphate and sulfur. Indonesia has no known
reserves of potash. The following table shows the projected fertilizer
capacity and output up to 1983:

Germany.

3.03      The annual production capacity for N fertilizer is projected to
increase fourfold to about one million tons of N by the end of this decade
when three additional plants - (a) PUSRI III, (b) East Kalimantan I, and
(c) West Java - are scheduled to be in commercial production. The Govern-
ment expects the East Kalimantan plant which is to be built on ships, to
begin production by January 1976 and the West Java plant by January 1978.
However, these dates may well slip since the East Kalimantan plant is based
on not yet commercially proven technology and may require a longer than usual
commissioning period and since financing arrangements for the West Java plant
were completed only at the end of 1974. Therefore, as reflected in the above
table, this report assumes that the two additional plants would be commissioned
only in January 1978 and 1979 respectively. The Government will from time to
time exchange views with the Bank regarding Indonesia's plans to meet the coun-
try's nutrient requirements.
3.04      Over the past, Indonesia's reliance on imported fertilizers increased
sharply as shown below:
Indonesia - Imports of Fertilizers, 1964-1972
('000 nutrient tons)
N     P 205     K2O      Total
1964           35.7   23.5       7.9      66.1
1972          289.3   93.3      35.8    418.4
Urea has gained increasing importance accounting for nearly 88% of total
N imports in 1972 compared to 39% in 1964. In absolute terms, urea imports
increased from 30,559 product tons (14,057 tons of N) in 1964 to 550,100
product tons (253,000 tons of N) in 1972. In recent times, bagged urea im-
port prices (c.i.f. Jakarta) have risen steeply from US$62/ton in January
1972 to US$424/ton in the last quarter of 1974 and, even at the current high



-9-
prices, urea in particular and fertilizers in general are not readily avail-
able in adequate quantity on the world market. This situation has provided
strong impetus to Indonesia's program to develop indigenous production facil-
ities, especially for urea which currently accounts for 85% of the country's
total annual supply of fertilizers compared to 9% in 1959. Urea is expected
to continue to be the most popular N fertilizer in Indonesia.
B.   Consumption Trends and Forecasts of Supply/Demand Balance
3.05      The N consumption increased from about 108,200 tons in 1964 to
305,100 tons in 1972, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 13.8%.
In considering this growth, it should be kept in mind that i fertilizer use
declined during 1965-1967 to 67,200 tons on account of foreign exchange con-
straints, and reached again the approximate 1964 level only in 1968. During
the same.period, the P205 consumption rose at an average annual rate of 8.1%
and 120, at 24%. The following table shows the trend of fertilizer consump-
tion in the past and forecast of local production compared to expected demand:

/a   P = Production.
/b   C = Consumption.
/c   In 1974, about 373,000 tons of N (90% of the total) were consumed in
the form of about 800,000 tons of urea. The actual urea consumption
in 1974 was significantly higher (95%) than the effective consumption
forecast of 410,000 tons of urea in the PUSRI II appraisal report. The
report, however, projected that the demand for urea that year would
reach about 600,000 tons. The report assumed that the effective con-
sumption would fall short of demand because of foreign exchange, dis-
tribution and other constraints in Indonesia. But the country has been
able to overcome those constraints to a great extent, and achieve in
1974 a consumption level about 33% higher than the forecast demand.
3.06      Though the fertilizer consumption has increased, the consumption
per ha of arable land is comparatively low in Indonesia as shown in the
following table:

/a   Figures in brackets give expected per ha consumption
for 1980.
3.07      Projections of total N fertilizer consumption in Indonesia made
in different studies show minor divergencies. In 1980, N consumption is
projected by TVA to be 668,000 tons. BEICIP's high forecast assumed 654,800
tons against a low forecast of 576,000 tons, which, in turn, is close to the
562,900 tons forecast by the NFS report of 1971/72. The NFS forecast, how-
ever, underestimated actual consumption in 1972 and 1973 by 34% and 24% re-
spectively. If it were corrected accordingly, it would be slightly above the
forecast of about 676,000 tons of N used in para 3.05 above. The Pelita II
(Second Five-Year Plan) target of 1.2 million tons of N in 1980 is not sup-
ported by any of the studies reviewed here.
3.08       There are divergences in forecasts for P205 and K20 consumption in
1980 ranging from 295,600 tons (NFS) to 146,600/205,000 tons (BEICIP low/
high cases) for the former and 168,300 tons (NFS) to 79,900/181,000 tons
(BEICIP low/high cases) for the latter. These forecasts reflect various
assumptions as to desirable NPK ratios and uncertainty, in the absence of
meaningful time series, on the amount of P205 and K20 which the Indonesian
farmer might be prepared to apply. The projections used in this report for
P205 and other nutrients are derived by using the assumptions for increases
in fertilized acreage and fertilizer dosages for rice from the draft Bank
report, `Irrigation Program Survey", and for other crops from the BEICIP
study, choosing in the light of recent trends, the most likely among the
alternative assumptions of BEICIP.
3.09       The ratio of N, P205 and K20 consumption is projected to change
from the 1972 1/ level of 10:1.7:1 to approximately 4.8:1.2:1 in 1978,
3.9:1.2:1  in 1980 and improve further to 2.9:1.2:1 by 1983, thus moving
towar d a balanced iuse of nutrients.
1/   Based on Bank and BEICIP forecasts:  1972 is used as the base year be-
cause the fertilizer consumption grew at a slower rate in 1973 owing
to the inability to procure in the world markets sufficient fertilizers
to meet the demand, and full data for 1974 are not available.

C.   Fertilizer Use by Crops and Regions
3.10      In 1972, rice accounted for about 67% of total N consumption and
587 of P205 consumption; and there was no use of K20 on that crop.  By 1978,
the share of N for rice is expected to rise to about 77% and stay at that
level up to 1983, while that of P205 would first decline slightly but reach
about 62,' in 1983.
3.11      Total foodcrops accounted for about 83%, 67% and 2% respectively
of the total N, P205 and K20 consumed in 1972 and are projected by BEICIP
to increase to 88%, 80% and 68% respectively in 1983. Thus foodcrops would
continue to dominate the consumption of fertilizers in Indonesia.
3.12      The following table shows the regional fertilizer consumption
projections which indicate that Java would continue to be by far the major
fertilizer user in Indonesia:

D.   Export Potential
3.13      As mentioned in para 3.05, Indonesia could emerge as an exporter of
N fertilizer toward the end of this decade. The exportable surplus is pro-
jected to increase to about 170,000 tons of N in 1980 and then gradually decline
to about 33,000 tons in 1983 as domestic demand rises, assuming only the plants
already noted are built. Indonesia should not find it difficult to market this
surplus in the neighboring countries, especially in the Philippines, Thailand,
Malaysia and Vietnam. 1/ Of these four countries, the Philippines intends to
establish an ammonia/urea plant of 1,000/1,725 TPD capacity; Malaysia could
set up a similarly-sized plant; and the Republic of Vietnam is considering
a smaller ammonia/urea plant of 660/1,135 TPD capacity. Assuming that thiese
plants would come on stream by 1983 and no other plant would be completed
in these countries by that time, TVA projected the import needs of these
countries to develop as follows:
1/   In October 1974 these countries met in Jakarta to start preliminary
discussions to prepare a strategy for developing a supply and demand
balance in the region.

3.14      Indonesia, because of its favorable location, is in an advantageous
position to cover these deficits compared to more distant countries which are
expected to have export surpluses by the end of this decade. For example,
the present transport cost per ton of fertilizer to Manila from Jakarta is
about US$20 less than from Persian Gulf countries.
E.   PUSRI Marketing and Distribution
3.15      PUSRI has established an efficient distribution network to market
its own and imported fertilizers and related agro-chemicals (para 2.09).
The Company's marketing organization which operates separately from its
manufacturing activities, is extensive and currently accounts for the dis-
tribution of about half of the total fertilizers consumed in Indonesia; it
is expected to remain the leading distributor in the future as well.
3.16      The marketing department of PUSRI has two bulk terminals at Surabaya
and Cilacap with bagging facilities; and storage depots and sub-depots in
selected locations (Map, IBRD-11220). A third bulk terminal/bagging station
built by PERTAMINA at Tanjung Priok (near Jakarta) is also available for
use by PUSRI, especially to handle imported fertilizers.
3.17      Urea from PUSRI I and PUSRI II is shipped from Palembang both in
bags, through Regular Liner Service (RLS) vessels which operate among the
islands, and in bulk, through carriers equipped for unloading at the bulk
terminals where urea is bagged, stored and dispatched for inland distribu-
tion. These present bulk carriers, with their grab-cranes, do not repre-
sent an optimal solution for fertilizer shipments. Therefore, they have
been contracted for only 27 months from October 1974, the time required to
develop and install the more efficient bulk shipping facility being appraised
by the Bank, capable of coping with the enlarged PUSRI production with sub-
stantial economies.
3.18      The Government is developing this facility as part of a fertilizer
distribution system in close cooperation with PUSRI and the Bank. PUSRI has
appointed consultants to design the system, and the Bank has appraised it
for a separate loan. The mission which returned early December, 1974 esti-
mates that equipment and services for the system would cost about US$120



- 14 -
million equivalent and is expected to recommend a Bank loan to fii.ance about
half of that amount. The proposed distribution system would use additional
bulk loading facilities at Palembang, and would consist of: self-unloading
ships capable of operation in all weather conditions; expansion of the exist-
ing bulk terminals in Java and establishment of new bulk terminals in Java
and Sumatra with adequate storage and bagging facilities; sufficient inland
storage capacity to provide a buffer between continuous shipping from the
plant and seasonal variation in fertilizer use; and inland transportation
facilities. The distribution system is expected to be in operation by mid-
1977. While the time available for implementation is short, iL is believed
to be realistic considering the extent of preparatory work done since July
1974 and the Government's keen interest in its timely execution. Assurances
have been obtained from the Government that the distribution system will be
financed and implemented according to schedule.
3.19      It is intended that initially about 80% of PUSRI production would
be shipped in bulk to the main markets in Java and Sumatra th-iough Lhe new
system, and the rest bagged and shipped in RLS vessels from Palembang. In
addition, PUSRI's imported fertilizers received in bulk and bags at Java
ports would be distributed through this system. Considerable economies would
be achieved by dispatching some imported fertilizers in bulk to ocher Indonesian
ports at low backhaul rates using the ships proposed for the system.
F.   Credit
3.20      Over 60% of the fertilizer is consumed in Indonesia in areas covered
by two successful programs for promoting intensive cultivation of foodcrops,
especially of rice: the BIMAS (Mass Guidance Program) and thet INMAS (Mass
Intensification) Program. The rest of the fertilizer is consumed mostly by
the cash crop or estate sector. The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) 4, now the
sole credit agency for the BIMAS and INMAS programs, while the estate sector
depends on the normal banking facilities to meet its credit needs. Adequate
credits are currently provided by BRI and the normal banking faci'lties at
1 to 2% monthly interest rates and no serious problem is foreseen with respect
to credit in the future. BRI is attempting to set up offices to process loan
applications in each village unit ("unit desa"). Village units without a BRI
office are covered by mobile units. To obtain fertilizer, the farmer has to
apply to the village head for an allocation and, for credit, to BR! for a
credit voucher covering the cost of the fertilizer allocated to him,. Fer-
tilizer is either sold in village "kiosks" operated by retailers or by vil-
lage unit cooperatives (BUUD's). It is the Government's policy to promote
the BUUD's as a main source of input supplies for farmers coverect by the
BIMAS and INMAS programs. Presently, they lack trained personnel tc oper-
ate efficiently and the Government is making efforts to strengi_`heu these co-
operatives.

IV. THE PROJECT
A,   Project Scope
4.01      The project will be located adjacent to the Company's existing
facilities (see Annex 4-1 for the plant layout) and will consist of two
modern large-scale, single-train units - an ammonia plant with 330,000 TPY
capacity and a urea plant with 570,000 TPY capacity. These units are more
than 50% larger in capacity than the ones installed for PUSRI II because
larger plants have come into commercial use since PUSRI II was conceived
and they provide better economies of scale. The project will also include
the necessary auxiliary facilities such as an ammonia storage tank, an
electric power plant, and a steam generating unit for the urea plant as
well as necessary equipment for construction, material handling, warehouse,
and laboratory. Housing will also be expanded; so will the existing jetty
and bulk loadine facilities to help meet the shipping needs of more than a
twofold increase of the Company's production. The project also includes
preliminary preparation of the proposed fertilizer transportation and dis-
tribution project. A description of the proposed PUSRI III production
processes and plant facilities and a project implementation schedule are
given in Annexes 4-2 and 4-3.
B.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.02      A raw material and product flow chart is given in Annex 4-4.  The
principal raw material for the project as well as for the existing facilities
is natural gas from the nearby oil and gas fields in South Sumatra operated
by PERTAMINA and STANVAC.  The project's daily gas requirements are about
60 million standard cubic feet (SCF) compared to 42 million SCF for PUSRI II
and 12 million SCF for PUSRI I. PUSRI I is served by a gas pipeline operated
by STANVAC while the rest of the Company's needs are to be met by the gas
gathering and transmission system with a capacity of 116 million SCF per day
developed by PERTAMINA as part of the PUSRI II project, financed by IDA.
PERTAMINA, under instructions from the Government, has engaged an engineering
firm to design and develop new gas fields in the Musi Block, about 140 km
southwest of PUSRI, and to upgrade the present system (by a 12 km loop from
Simpiang to the plant) to secure initial gas supplies by October 1976 when
the gas will be needed for preliminary tests and to achieve full supply six
months later when the plant is expected to undergo performance tests. The
schedule for this project though tight could be met as orders for pipes
which are in short supply in the world, have already been placed. However,
the present gas supply system with some additional production drilling is
capable of meeting the gas needs of PUSRI II as well as PTJSRI III for sev-
eral years after PUSRI III starts up, should the completion of the new sys-
tem be delayed for any reason. The Government has confirmed that it has
already instructed PUSRI and PERTAMINA to take prompt measures to meet fully
PUSRI's expanded needs and to negotiate and agree on, before September 1,
1975, an amendment to the present gas purchase agreement between the parties
to reflect the increase in volume and any change in the basis for pricing.



- 16 -
4.03      The proven gas reserves of those fields already connected to the
pipeline system are estimated at 856 billion SCF (Annex 4-5), adequate to
meet PUSRI's entire needs for about 16 years, after allowing 30% for field
uses (e.g. for compressors) and field losses. This is based on the as-
surance of the Government that the gas from the existing system will be
supplied exclusively to PUSRI. For the purpose of financial projections,
it has been assumed that the gas price will not exceed Rp 250 (US$0.60) per
1,000 SCF. This is calculated on the basis that the new gas gathering and
transmission system would require this price to cover all costs, and earn
a reasonable return on invested capital.
4.04      The project includes the construction of a 15 MW power plant,
while the needs of the existing facilities are met by a separate unit of
the same size. In addition, there is a 5 MW unit on standby which origin-
ally served PUSRI I. Thus, power supply is assured. PUSRI III will gener-
ate its own steam, and water for industrial as well as drinking purposes
will be obtained from the Musi River.
C.  Bag Supply
4.05      Originally, the Company used multi-walled paper bags but, because
of breakage and fertilizer losses in transit, later shifted to polypropylene
bags which, being sturdier, can withstand rough handling and transportation
over water and rugged roads. While about 30% more expensive than poly-
ethelene bags, a cost-benefit analysis prepared for PUSRI shows the use of
polypropylene bags still to be cost saving to the economy since it prevents
fertilizer losses in handling and transportation. The Company will, there-
fore, establish a plant at an estimated cost of Rp 4.2 billion (US$10 mil-
lion) to produce sufficient polyethelene-lined polypropylene bags from pur-
chased chips to meet all of PUSRI's bagging needs.
D.   Project Execution
4.06      Using the staff experienced on PUSRI II as a nucleus, the Company
has formed a project team headed by Mr. Kotan Pasaman, Technical and Pro-
duction Director, to work with Kellogg (U.S.) and Toyo Engineering (Japan),
and coordinate the work on PUSRI III. As the Company engineering staff is
somewhat limited in size, it is being supplemented with experts from Scien-
tific Design, of the U.K., which will continue as PUSRI's Technical Advisor.
A detailed project execution plan, similar to that for PUSRI II, has been
prepared by the Company with the help of the Technical Advisor. Kellogg
will have overall responsibility for providing the complete fertilizer plant
which will be supplied as follows: (1) the ammonia plant and all offsites
and auxiliaries are being designed and procured by Kellogg which is also
responsible for the overall construction, erection and successful start-up
of the entire project; and (2) the urea plant is being designed by Toyo which
is also procuring the equipment for shipment to the plant site ready for erec-
tion by Kellogg.



- 17 -
4.07      In May 1974, after consultation with the Bank, PUSRI signed new
contracts with Kellogg, Toyo and Scientific Design, i.e., the same firms
which had been selected for PUSRI II. Their technical services are based
on. fixed fees. Detailed civil engineering is being carried out by Kellogg
and civil construction will be done by local contractors under Kellogg's
supervision. The Government has agreed to give prompt approvals as needed
to execute the project in accordance with a critical path schedule prepared
for PUSRI and agreed to by the Government, Kellogg, Toyo and the Bank. Work
on the project started mid-1974 and the project is expected to be mechani-
cally complete by early 1977, with commercial production after start-up
tests scheduled for May 1, 1977 (Annex 4-3). This is a tight but realistic
schedule given the good performance record for PUSRI II and the arrangements
for project implementation based on the Company's experience.
E.   Employment and Training
4.08      At the end of 1974, PUSRI had about 2,200 employees.  An additional
550 persons would be employed by PUSRI III, bringing total employment to
2,750 by 1977. The incremental direct employment generation by the project
is low because of the capital-intensive nature of the project and also be-
cause of an orderly redeployment of labor from PUSRI I whose work force is
at present in excess of requirements. Kellogg, Toyo and Scientific Design
will train PUSRI staff and arrangements will also be made for a few selected
PUSRI personnel for specialized training outside Indonesia. Agreement has
been obtained from the Company and the Government that they will take adequate
measures to maintain and augment the skilled manpower of PUSRI as needed.
F.  Ecology
4.09      The effect on the environment of a modern ammonia/urea plant of
the type to be constructed is minimal, and no appreciable amount of harmful
wastes will be discharged. Non-gaseous effluents from the project are small
and will be treated in the water treatment unit already established under
PUSRI II. Indonesian regulations for gaseous effluents are not well defined
but this will have no practical effect because of the use of modern ammonia
and urea technology and also because the local natural gas is almost sulfur
free. The plant will be designed to standards established by Kellogg and
Toyo based on normal operating specifications and regulations in the U.S.
and Japan. Therefore, pollution control facilities envisaged under PUSRI
III are satisfactory, and are expected to account for about 2% of the base
project cost. The Company has confirmed that the project will be implemented,
operated and maintained with adequate measures for environmental protection
and monitoring.

V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A.   Project Costs
5.01      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$192
million equivalent, including US$157.6 million in foreign exchange. Details
of capital cost estimates given in Annex 5-1 are summarized below:

- 19 -
5.02      The above cost estimates are based on comparable Bank Group proj-
ects and data prepared by PUSRI with the help of Scientific Design, using
September, 1974 prices quoted to Kellogg and Toyo by prospective equipment
suppliers and actual bids received for about 50% of estimated equipment
cost. In addition to expenses for detailed engineering, construction, erect-
tion and commissioning, the costs of engineering services and project manage-
ment include license fees, procurement and field supervision costs, train-
ing expenses, payment to vendor servicemen, costs of technical advisor as
well as consultants on management, accounting, shipping and marketing, and
provision for bonus payment to the general contractor for early project
completion. The costs under this head are larger for PUSRI III than for
similar projects in some other countries because of: (i) lack of trained
manpower in Indonesia, thus necessitating heavy reliance on expatriates;
and (ii) need for training local personnel for positions in production,
maintenance, finance and management. Physical contingencies equivalent
to 6% of the base cost estimates have been added; they are relatively low,
due to the advanced stage of procurement. Price escalation for equipment
(excluding short-delivery items worth about US$10 million for which orders
have been placed on fixed price contracts) is calculated on the basis of
projected price increases of 3.5% for the last quarter of 1974, 12% in
1975, 10% in 1976 and 8% a year thereafter in major equipment supplying
countries because of worldwide inflation and supply shortages. On civil
works, excalation rates of 4.5% for the last quarter of 1974, 16% in 1975,
14% in 1976 and 12% a year thereafter have been assumed based on the projected
rates of inflation in Indonesia. The above cost estimates, including physical
and price contingencies, are considered adequate.
5.03      Working capital requirements for the project are estimated at
Rp 2,627 million (US$6.3 million) excluding the cost of spares and the
initial supply of catalysts included under equipment and material costs.
Details of working capital calculations are given in Annex 5-2.  Should actual
working capital requirements be higher than anticipated, PUSRI is expected
either to use its own cash generation or to obtain short-term credits.
B. Financing Plan
5.04      The financing plan for the project will be as follows:

- 20 -
5.05      The estimated total foreign exchange cost component of PUSRI III
is Rp 65.41 billion (US$157.6 million) of which nearly 73% would be met from
the Bank loan and the remaining 27% by the Government which will also con-
tribute all local currency financing, including working capital. In case
of any cost overrun, it is the responsibility of the Government to provide
promptly the additional funds to complete the project on terms satisfactory
to the Bank.
5.06      The Bank loan will be made to the Government which will on-lend
the proceeds to PUSRI for 15-1/2 years including 3-1/2 years of grace at
an annual interest of 12%, including a 3-1/2% fee accruing to the Govern-
ment which will bear the foreign exchange risk. The loan will be repay-
able in 24 equal semi-annual installments beginning from the second half
of 1978, i.e., 1-1/4 years after the expected start of commercial produc-
tion.
C. Procurement
5.07      International competitive bidding procedures in accordance with
Bank guidelines are being used for major items -- independent of the
source of financing - estimated to cost about US$85 million including escala-
tion. In addition, proprietary equipment essential to the process and items
in limited supply as well as related spare parts, which are estimated to
cost together about US$10 million and are critical to the timely completion
of the project, are being procured following bidding from lists of qualified
suppliers, after prior approval of the Bank. Items costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent each, and totalling about US$1 million will be purchased
from suppliers on the basis of suitability, availability and price following
approval by the Bank of the items falling into this category. A preference
of 15% or the existing customs duty, whichever is lower, will be allowed
to Indonesian products in which at least 20% of the bid price is of
national origin, for the purpose of evaluating international competitive
bids. Bid evaluation is PUSRI's responsibility with the assistance as
required from the engineering firms contracted. To expedite deliveries in
a tight equipment supply situation, PUSRI has assigned procurement officers
to the main offices of the two engineering firms. Overall, as a result of
the advanced contracting followed by PUSRI after approval by the Bank, the
scheduled project completion date has been advanced by nearly one year.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.08      The Bank loan will cover foreign exchange costs (excluding those
paid before loan signing) of equipment and services, including engineering
and licensing fees, as shown below:



- 21 -

Total                                          115
5.09      It is estimated that the loan will be disbursed according to
the schedule presented in Annex 5-3. Any surplus funds remaining in the
loan account after completion of the project will be cancelled.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Project Revenue and Profit
6.01      The financial analysis of the project is done on an incremental
basis and in real 1977 terms. The assumptions, listed in detail in Annex
6-1, are summarized below.
6.02      It is assumed that the project will start production on May 1,
1977 with capacity utilization increasing gradually from 75% in the first
operating year to 80% in the second and 90% in the third and beyond. Because
of PUSRI's past record and provision for technical assistance for the
project, the attainment of 90% capacity utilization is considered con-
servative. The economic life of the project is assumed to be 12 operating
years with assets depreciated on a straight line basis. At 90% capacity
utilization, the project would produce 522,000 TPY of urea.
6.03      As mentioned in para 2.11, the Government sets and controls the
price at which domestic producers sell their fertilizer to the Government,
currently Rp 63,900 (US$154) per ton, c.i.f. Java. During negotiations
agreement was obtained that the Government will not preclude a reasonable
return after taxes on the Company's assets in service and adequate debt
service coverage (at least 1.5 times) at all times. For the purpose of
projections, the current ex-factory price of Rp 55,900 (US$135) per ton
has been used to calculate the production income assuming it is not likely
to be raised by 1977. Operating costs are calculated at 1977 constant
prices except for real increases in labor and maintenance costs.
B.   Production Costs
6.04      The following table shows the per ton production cost of the
project at 90% capacity utilization:

6.05      The principal raw material, natural gas -  assumed to be supplied
at an economic cost of Rp 250 (60 US cents)/MSCF - accounts for about 20%
of the production costs including depreciation and financial charges which
together represent the largest share (48.8%) of total production costs.
Production profit (excluding income from inter-Company bag sales) in relation
to the projected ex-factory price of US$135 per ton amounts to about 22%
as shown below.

6.07      Total sales of the project are expected to increase from about
Rp 17.1 billion in 1977 (from 8 months of operation) to Rp 31.1 billion
in 1980 (the first year of sales equal to full production). Net profit
after tax of the project increases from about Rp 3.3 billion in 1977
to Rp 8.2 billion in 1980 and Rp 8.6 billion in 1981 but declines the
following year to Rp 5.0 billion because the 5-year tax holiday for the
project ends in 1981. However, the percentage of net profit/sales in 1982,
the first year of tax payment, will be at a satisfactory level of 16%.
6.08      The project is expected to generate from the beginning enough
cash to more than meet its debt service requirements. Beyond 1981, the
debt service coverage will weaken because of the assumed tax payments (45%
of profit) but it will still be at an adequate level of over 1.5 times.
D.   Incremental Financial Rate of Return
6.09      The incremental financial rate of return before tax is 13.8% in
real terms and is acceptable. Capital costs used for the return calculations
include items which in other fertilizer projects would not always be included
in project costs; they are Rp 540 million (US$1.3 million) for expanding
the Company's existing housing facilities; Rp 2.1 billion (US$5 million) for
the construction of a jetty; Rp 125 million (US$0.3 million) for the prep-
aration of the transportation and distribution project; and Rp 4,150 million
(US$10 million) for the bag-making plant.
6.10      Sensitivity tests have been conducted to determine the effects
of various events on the financial rate of return; the results are shown
in Annex 6-3and are summarized below:
PUSRI III - Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return
Case                                            _
1.   Base Case                                                13.8
2.   Sales revenue decrease by 10%                            10.8
3.   Capital cost increase by 10%                             12.1
4.   Operating cost increase by 10%                           12.6
5.   6-month project delay and 10% capital cost overrun   10.8
6.   80% capacity utilization                                 12.3
6.11      The rate of return is more sensitive to changes in sales revenue
than in operating and capital costs.  It would drop to 10.8% if sales
revenue were to fall by 10%; and decline to 12.6% if operating costs were
to increase by 10%. Further, a six-month delay in project implementation,
combined with a 10% capital cost overrun and the eventual attainment of only
80% capacity utilization, would reduce the return to 9.2%. However, with the
possible exception of the overly tight equipment supply situation worldwide



- 24 -
that is affecting all fertilizer plant construction underway at present, the
likelihood of this happening is low, particularly because of the involvement
of experienced engineering firms and the fact that about 50% of the equipment
has already been ordered.
E.   Break-Even Point
6.12      The profit break-even for the project in 1980 would be 62%, and
the cash break-even, 51%. A break-even chart is provided in Annex 6-4. Urea
prices could fall or operating costs increase by about 30% for profit break-
even at 90% capacity utilization. The project could break-even on a cash
basis even if urea prices were to fall or operating costs increase by 40%.
F.   Analysis of PUSRI with the Project
6.13      Details of consolidated financial projections for PUSRI with the
project given in Annexes 6-5 and 6-6 are summarized below:

6.14      Assumptions used are detailed in Annex 6-1 and most of them are
identical to those used for the project. As mentioned previously (para
2.11), the Government purchases urea from local producers before allocating
them as well as imported urea to selected distributors for sales to farmers
through sub-distributors and retailers. The per ton margin allowed for
distributors is Rp 13,100 (US$31.6) and for sub-distributors and retailers,
Rp 5,000 (US$12) as reflected in the following four common transaction
prices fixed by the Government for both local and imported urea:  Gov-
ernment to distributors, Rp 41,900/ton; distributors to sub-distributors,
Rp 55,000/ton; sub-distributors to retailers, Rp 59,000/ton; and retailers
to farmers, Rp 60,000/ton. These prices are substantially lower than the
Government purchase price (c.i.f. Java) of urea, that is, Rp 63,900/ton for
locally-produced urea and Rp 176,000/ton for imported urea.
6.15      The consolidated projections show that during 1975-1982 total
sales volume would increase by about 130%, while net profit would increase
15 times starting from a low base. Projected increases in sales during
1975-1976 are the result of production build-up in the newly-commissioned
PUSRI II and during 1977-1982 mainly due to PUSRI III. The net profit
declines slightly between 1979 and 1982, in spite of the decrease in interest
burden because, as mentioned in para 6.07, from 1982 the Company will no
longer enjoy the tax holiday on PUSRI III. The debt/equity ratio of PUSRI
is projected to exceed 50/50 during 1975-77. However, it is forecast to
reach a more satisfactory level in 1978 and improve to 26/74 in 1982 as-
suming all earnings are retained and no further expansion.
6.16      During negotiations, the following covenants similar to those in
the PUSRI II agreements were obtained: (i) PUSRI will have subsidiaries
only with the prior approval of the Bank; (ii) without Bank consent, PUSRI
will not incur additional long-term indebtedness other than Rp 47.7 billion
(US$115 million equivalent) for PUSRI III if as a consequence the debt/equity
ratio would exceed 50/50; (iii) PUSRI will depreciate fixed assets of PUSRI III
over 12 years of its operating life and other assets in conformity with sound
accounting principles; (iv) without Bank consent, PUSRI will not declare
dividends except out of accumulated net earnings nor pay dividends if its
quick assets 1/ would be less than its current liabilities or until the
project shall have produced at 80% capacity for 12 consecutive months, i.e.
456,000 tons; and (v) except for the project and normal replacements for
PUSRI I and II, PUSRI will not invest more than US$2 million per year
without Bank consent until PUSRI III produces at 80% capacity for 12
consecutive months.
6.17      With respect to the PUSRI II Credit, the Government agreed to take
measures necessary to assist PUSRI to sell "at competitive prices in accordance
with sound camercial practice."  This has been interpreted by the Government
1/   Cash, securities readily convertible into cash, and trade receivables
realizable within one year.



- 26 -
and IDA to be prices which will allow PUSRI to meet its obligations (including
making its agreed contribution to financing PUSRI II) and to maintain a debt
service coverage of 1.5 times. In practice, some of the above covenants were
not specific enough and, therefore, with respect to PUSRI III, the following
additional covenants were agreed on: (a) PUSRI will not be precluded from
earning a reasonable return (para 6.03) on its assets in service while main-
taining efficient operation and a debt service coverage of 1.5 times; (b)
PUSRI will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2 during the continuation
of the present controlled distribution system and 1.4 thereafter, in view of
the seasonal nature of demand for fertilizers, the Company's rapidly increasing
sales volume and its recent working capital problems; and (c) the Government
will subscribe Rp 31.96 billion (US$77 million equivalent) in new equity
in foreign exchange and local currency as required to meet the project's
requirements.
G. Major Risks
6.18      The project design is based on modern commercially proven techno-
logy for economically efficient large-scale production, thus minimizing
technical and obsolescence risks in the project. Further, little commercial
risk is foreseen because urea has been produced and marketed by PUSRI during
the last 10 years and it is the most common fertilizer used in Indonesia.
However, the project could face problems for lack of adequate transportation
and marketing facilities, or realistic Government policies regarding fertil-
izer prices. To minimize these problems, the Bank is appraising (para 3.18)
the establishment of a more efficient distribution system. Further, it has
to be noted that in the past, the Government responded to PUSRI financial
needs rather slowly and the Company could face certain risks because of
similar slow response in the future.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. World Fertilizer Prices
7.01      New technology developed in the 1960's called for 1,000 TPD urea
plants as the minimum economic size and led to substantially lower produc-
tion cost on account of economies of scale and, more importantly, because
of a more efficient use of fuel and feedstock. For example, to produce
one ton of urea, PUSRI II needs only 60% of the gas for fuel and feedstock
that PUSRI I consumes. Such advantages stimulated investment in urea
capacity in the world and brought ex-factory prices in 1970 to a low level
of US$50-60 per ton, barely sufficient to cover operating costs. Investments
had all but ceased when the green revolution with its high-yielding seed
varieties dramatically increased fertilizer demand. The ensuing worldwide
shortage has boosted recent f.o.b. prices of urea to over US$400 per ton,
far beyond the level accounted for by inflation in equipment and energy
costs. Estimates of when demand and supply would be in better balance and
of prices resulting therefrom are difficult to make partly because more



- 27 -
reliable worldwide supply forecasts are only now being developed and
uncertainties about fertilizer consumption trends, particularly as they may
be influenced by the present high fertilizer prices. However, supply/demand
forecasts recently made by the Bank, taking into account new nitrogen
fertilizer plants under construction or planned, show a deficit for 1980 of
about 1.9 million tons of N in Asia and world-wide a small deficit of about
0.1 million tons. However, a small surplus is also possible if the recent
sharply accelerated trend in building new capacity were to continue.
For purposes of economic analysis, it has been assumed that supply and
demand will be more or less in balance by the time PUSRI III begins pro-
duction and that, therefore, the world price for bagged urea would fall
to US$151 per ton (f.o.b., exporting countries) or US$176/ton, c.i.f.
Jakarta, taking an average freight rate from exporting countries to Indonesia
of US$25 per ton. Deducting from this the economic transportation cost of
US$7/ton from PUSRI to Java, the resultant price of US$169/ton has been used
as an economic accounting price to value the output of PUSRI III.
Economic Rate of Return
7.02      Detailed assumptions for the economic rate of return calculation
are given in Annex 7-1.  The economic rate of return for the project is about
20%. For the base case, gas has been priced at US$0.60/MSCF except for
the purchase of the gas which could alternatively be used by existing oil-
burning consumers (2 refineries and 2 power plants) for which US$1.40/MSCF I/
has been assumed as the opportunity cost until the new gas system is ex-
pected to be on stream by 1978. Sensitivity tests performed on the economic
rate of return (Annex 7-2) show that using US$1.40/MSCF for all of the gas
for the life of the project would result in a return of 15.3%.  A 10% drop
in urea price would reduce it to 16.7%, while a 10% increase in operating
costs would bring it to 18.9%.  The return is also sensitive to delays in
project implementation, cost overrun and under-utilization of capacity. A
six month delay in project completion, combined with a 10% capital cost
overrun and 80% capacity utilization (as against 90% assumed) would drop
the economic return to a still satisfactory level of 14.8%. Further, it
is conceivable that during 1979-1982, when Indonesia is forecast to have
some surplus of urea, PUSRI may be asked by the Government to export
part of its production. During that period, even if PUSRI were to export
one-third of the output from the project, the rate of return would drop
only marginally to 19.3%. Therefore, under conceivable adverse conditions,
the project yields an acceptable rate of return.
C.   Supply of Fertilizers and Food
7.03      Assuming 90% capacity utilization, the project would augment the
annual fertilizer supply in Indonesia by 522,000 tons of urea or 236,000
tons of nitrogen nutrients. Assuming further that a ton of plant nutrients
helps produce about 8-10 tons of foodgrains under local conditions,
1/   Equivalent to US$11 per barrel of crude oil in terms of heating value.



- 28 -
the annual supply of plant nutrients from the project would help increase
food production in Indonesia by 1.9 million to 2.4 million TPY, enough to
feed 9.5-12 million people annually.
D.   Direct Foreign Exchange Savings
7.04      One of the most important benefits from the project is the annual
gross direct foreign exchange savings after deducting the foreign exchange
components of operating costs. As shown in Annex 7-3, such foreign exchange
savings at the projected 1977 world prices would be about Rp 36 billion
(US$87 million equivalent) annually after the project achieves full production.
The estimated foreign exchange financing required for the project - nearly
US$158 million - would, therefore, be more than covered in less than two years
of operation at full production.
E.   Employment Generation
7.05      Direct employment from the project is low at 550 but it is expected
to have a significant impact on indirect job creation especially in trans-
portation, storage and distribution of fertilizers and in the exploitation
and distribution of natural gas.
VIII. AGREEMENTS

(paras 6.03, 6.14 and 6.17).
(b) From PUSRI that it will:
(i)  strengthen financial management and improve
financial reporting and forecasts (paras 2.08
and 2.16);
(ii)  agree on amendment to the long-term contract

total equity of the Company (para 6.16);
(vii)  not undertake without the Bank's consent expenditures
exceeding US$2 million a year until PUSRI III achieves
80% of capacity utilization for 12 consecutive months
(para 6.16); and
(viii)  not pay dividends without Bank consent, if (a) the
quick assets of PUSRI are less than its current lia-
bilities, and (b) until PUSRI III achieves sustained
80% capacity utilization (para 6.16).
(c)  From the Government and PUSRI that they will:
(i)  take all steps necessary to accelerate the implementa-
tion of a transportation and distribution project to
meet PUSRI's needs (para 3.18); and
(ii)  maintain and augment the trained manpower of PUSRI
(para 4.08).

ANNEX 1
INDONESIA: PUSRI FERTILIZER EXPANSION PPlOECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS
1.        Following is a description of the technical terms used in this
report:
2.        Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements,
6 in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six, and others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc, iron,
aluminium, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper.  Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
are readily available from the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium -- three main nutrients -- and the other elements are drawn from the
soil. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials containing the
three main nutrients, soil is soon depleted of fertility by cropping. Use of
organic materials such as animal and vegetable wastes can be utilized but the
scale and intensity of moderm agriculture have far exceeded the availability
of natural "fertilizers." Consequently, the majority of the world's primary
plant nutrient needs are now supplied in the form of manufactured or "chemical"
fertilizers. To an increasing degree, secondary nutrients such as calcium,
manganese are also added to soils along with the primary nutrients in ratios
prescribed by agronomists according to specific crop and soil needs.
3.        Chemical Fertilizers:  Chemical compounds suitable as fertilizers
should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards and handling
problems; and readily water soluble and available to plant root systems.
Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a large degree
are:

Phosphate (DAP)    18%           phosphate       18%
Because of the high nutrient content of urea, diammonium phosphate and potassium
chloride (KCL), they are some of the most popular fertilizer materials in the
world today. It is the common practice to report the nutrient content of
materials in terms of percentages of N (nitrogen), P205 (phosphorus pentoxide)
and K20 (potassium oxide).
4.        Complex or NPK Fertilizers:  All three primary nutrients (N, P Cr, K20)
are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios varying wilh~ the
nutrient requirements of different crops. To facilitate handling, the several
required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform granules for distribution.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
The analysis of each nutrient is given as a ratio to describe the NPK product.
Thus 15-15-15 complex fertilizer contains 15% each of N, P205, and K20; and
12-2h-12 complex fertilizer contains 12% N, 24% P205 and 12% K20.
5.        Phosphate Water Solubility:  The agronomic availability (or efficiency)
of phosphate materials vary substantially. A common practice is to use water
solubility as a criterion although in acidic soils it is a less significant factor.
Higher P205 water solubility permits the fertilizer to be absorbed more rapidly.
The minimum recommended in most cases is about 60% solubility but in some cases
up to 80-85% solubility is preferred.
6.        Ammonium Nitrate (AN) is produced by reacting ammonia with nitric acid.
Nitric acid (HN03), in turn, is made from ammonia (NH~). AN contains 34.5%
nitrogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the nitrate form, and is very
hygroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive. In mxa y countries, a diluent --
e.g., limestone -- is added to lower the analysis and negate the explosive properties
as well as to minimize the hydroscopic properties.
7.        Feedstocks are the hydrocarbons used to produce hydrogen for the ammonia
synthesis; in the proposed Pusri III plant, the feedstock would be natural gas
which is usually the most economical choice when available. Other potential
feedstocks are naphtha, fuel oil, crude oil, coal or lignite.
8.        Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CONTH2 - the normal amide
of carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the ammonium form.
It is considerably less hydroscopic than ammonium nitrate and it is the most widely
used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
9.        Urea Synthesis:  Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide.
Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia synthesis, urea pro-
duction is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant. Unfortunately, the
corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does not form stable ammonium
salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids. Therefore, simple neutralization
as used in making ammonium nitrate and sulfate fertilizers is not possible. Instead,
ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined under heat and pressure to make ammonium
carbamate which although unstable, can be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a
stable compound. Again, unfortunately, the overall reaction is completely reversible
and even at 300 atmospheres pressure and 2000C, the conversion to urea in a single
pass through the reactor is under 70%. This introduces several complications:
high pressure must be used to maximize conversion; unconverted reactants must be
separated and recycled; increased corrosion under the high temperatures and
pressures used must be overcome, and urea decomposition into undesirable products
must be minimized. In recent years, several engineering and producing companies
have developed ways of surmounting these problems, and large plants capable of
producing 1,725 tons per day, or more, of urea to rigid chemical and physical
specifications are now operating successfully for long periods throughout the world.
Petroleum Units and Measures
10.       The petroleum industry historically has used units of measure based on
the English measuring system. Conversion rates for some units are given below:



ANNEX 1
Page 3
1 barrel          =   2 US gallons;
1 US gallon          3.785 liters = 0.003785 13
1 Normal Cubic
Meter (NM3)    =  37.3 Standard Cubic Feet (SCF)
The conversion rates between volumetric units, such as gallons, and .eight.
are approximate since the specific gravity.of the oil varies slightly with
its composition.
11.      Mlaterials that exist in the form of ga-es, such as methane
(natural gas), are measured in volumetric unit..  `7ince gnFes are com-
pressible, standard conditions of temperature and pressure (600F and
1.0 atmosphere) are used. to define the quantity (in volume) of gas,
and designated as "normal cubic meters."-

ANNEX 2-1
INDONESIA: PUSRI FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING FACILITIES
A. PUSRI I
2.01      PUSRI I, the original plant, by present standards is a small
one. It was engineered by H. K. Ferguson Company, a subsidiary of
Morrison-Knudsen (U.S.), with the Girdler Corporation (U.S.) providing
the ammonia process and the Toyo Engineering Corporation (TEC), of
Japan, the urea process. Its ammonia and urea units have capacities
of 180 TPD and 300 TPD respectively, while modern fertilizer plants
have capacities more than fivefold higher, and use efficient single-
train ammonia facilities based on centrifugal compressors. PUSRI I
uses reciprocating compressors in its dual-train ammonia and urea units.
Because of its relatively small size and obsolete technology, PUSRI I
is a high-cost producer compared to larger scale fertilizer plants.
This disadvantage has been aggravated by the pricing policy of the
Government with the aim of providing fertilizers at a low cost to
farmers. However, through good plant maintenance and replacement
investments, PUSRI I has been operating near or above rated capacity
since 1969. The plant is self-sufficient in utilities, but the power-
generating facility is nearing the end of its useful life.
2.02      Feedstock to PUSRI I is natural gas from STANVAC fed through
a 75-kilometer pipeline having about 12 million standard cubic feet
(SCF) per day capacity. The gas supply agreement between PUSRI and
STANVAC expires in 1983 at which time ownership of the gas and gas
system would be transferred to PERTAMINA.
2.03      PUSRI I will need major repairs by 1976, including the prill
tower and the urea reactor.  However, the ammonia plant, which does not
have the corrosion problem, is capable of continuing its operation
beyond 1976. PUSRI is currently exploring possible choices for PUSRI I
modernization including urea granulation or using potential excess
prilling capacity in PUSRI II and III. The anhydrous ammonia from
the unit could also be used as a raw material for complex fertilizer
production, or could be sold as such.
B. PUSRI II
2.04      Work on PUSRI II was originally scheduled to start in April 1970 and
the plantwas expected to be in commercial operation by September 1973.
However, the implementation began nearly a year later than anticipated
because of the time required to develop bid specifications and to
negotiate supply and service contracts satisfactory to all parties.
2.05      FUSRI II includes: (1) modern single-train ammonia and urea
plants of 660 TPD and 1,150 TPD capacity; and (2) a gas supply system
with 172-km pipeline- for gas gathering and transmission from PERTAMINA
and STANVAC gasfields in South Sumatra. The original estimate of



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
financing required for PUSRI II was equivalent to nearly US$ 91 million,
including about US$ 15 million equivalent for the gas system. The foreign
exchange cost excluding interest during construction was estimated at
US$ 68.0 million, of which IDA committed US$ 30 million;USAID, US$ 20
million; ADB, US$ 10 million; and OECF, US$ 8 million. However PUSRI II
experienced cost increases because of: (1) international currency realign-
ments; (2) expansion of the gas gathering and transmission system capacity
by 90% to 116 million SCF/day over the original plan (60 million SCF/day)
to cover the requirements of PERTAMINA's two refineries and of two power
plants operated by the Nartinal Power Company; and (3) a general escalation
in equipment costs higher than anticipated partly due to the one-year delay
in the start of the Project. According to latest calculations, PUSRI II
total cost amounts to over US$ 122 million, including us$ 39 million for
the gas system. The increase in the foreign exchange cost was almost fully
covered by additional commitments by the four lenders, including US$ 5 million
from IDA through a supplementary credit approved May 15, 1973. The Government
has borne the rest of the cost increase.
2.06      PUSRI II went into production in  September 1974.  It
has in-plant facilities for the supply of utilities. It also supplies
power to PUSRI I as the latter's old power generating unit is now used
as a standby. Further, while PUSRI I ships bagged urea, PUSRI II product
is shipped in bulk; however, cross-connection allows part of the PUSRI II
production to be bagged using PUSRI I bagging facilities. PERTAMINA
supplies gas to PUSRI II under a 20-year gas purchase agreement using an
agreed price formula which covers all operating costs including deprecia-
tion and financial charges. Based on this formula, the gas price is expected to
gradually decline from 31US cents to 17 US cents per MSCF during 1974-
1980.
2.07      The ammonia plant of PUSRI II was designed by M. W. Kellogg
Company (U.S.), using its own process, and the urea plant by the Toyo
Engineering Corporation (Japan), based on the Mitsui Toatsu process.
Kellogg had overall responsibility for the entire fertilizer plant, with
ovo Rs sub-contractor.  Scientific D~esign Company (UK), as Technical
/dviser, assisted PUSXI. Agrar-und Hydrotechnic GmbH of the Federal
Republic of Germany has been serving as Marketing Consultants and Price
Jaterhouse and Associates of the U.K./Australia, as Accounting and

ANNEX 3
INDONESIA:  PUSRI FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
Background
1.        Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago of more than 13,000
islands of which about 3,000 are inhabited. It has an area bigger than the
whole of Europe and has a population of about 127 million, making it the
fifth most populous nation in the world. The population is growing at a
fast rate of 2.4% a year. The population growth rate is expected to de-
cline slightly to 2.34% during 1976-1981 and to 2.29% during 1981-86, with
the population reaching about 147 million in 1980 and 161 million in 1983.
2.        According to the 1971 Census, of the total population of about
119 million people, nearly 64% lived in Java and Madura; 17.5% in Sumatra;
7.2% in Sulawesi; 4.3% in Kalimantan; and 7.0% in the other islands (Table 1).
Further, the 1971 Census showed that of the total number of people employed
(39.2 million), about 63% were engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing
compared to 7.5% in manufacturing. Agriculture accounts for about 50% of
Gross National Product and almost all non-petroleum exports.
3.        During the First Five-Year Plan (Pelita I) which ended March 31,
1974, Indonesia's real annual economic growth averaged about 7%. During
Pelita II (1974-79), the rate is expected to be 7.5%. This growth rate is
projected to be maintained beyond 1979 as well.
4.        Indonesia is rich in oil and natural gas resources.  Its growth
prospects have improved significantly with the rise in oil prices from
US$2.93 a barrel in April 1973 to US$12.6 a barrel in July 1974. The country
currently produces 1.45 million barrels of oil a day, ranking the 10th
largest crude oil producer in the world. By 1980, its crude oil production
is expected to rise to 2 million barrels a day.
Agricultural Situation
5.        Agricultural production has grown at the rate of 4% a year during
Pelita I. Rice is the most important foodcrop which accounts for about one-
third of the food production by value and over 10% of GNP. Other major
foodcrops are: Corn, cassava, sweet potatoes, soybeans and peanuts. Among
the estate crops grown are rubber, oilpalm, sugarcane, tea, coffee, tobacco,
cloves, coconuts and pepper. Production of foodcrops other than rice in-
creased marginally or even decreased over the period 1969-1973. However,
during the same period, rice production rose significantly from 10.8 million



ANNEX 3
Page 2
tons to 13.4 million tons. Despite this increase in rice production, Indo-
nesia has been importing 0.5 million to 1.5 million tons of rice in recent
years.
Harvested Area
6.         In 1972, the harvested area under all crops was about 16.5 million
ha (Table 2) of which 11.5 million ha (nearly 70%) was under foodcrops and
the rest under estate crops. Rice alone, with approximately 8 million ha of
harvested area, accounted for about 48% of the total harvested area in the
country.
7.        Java accounts for the largest harvested area among all islands in
Indonesia, with Sumatra coming next (Table 2). For example, in 1972, Java
accounted for 8.14 million ha of harvested area or about 49.3% of the total,
while Sumatra accounted for 28% with 4.6 million ha. Thus, Java and Sumatra
accounted for slightly more than 77% of the total harvested area that year.
8.        The total fertilized area in Indonesia was about 4.8 million ha in
1972, of which 3.85 million ha (80%) were under foodcrops and the rest under
estate crops (Table 3). Rice alone accounted for about 63.4% of the total
fertilized area, with about 3 million ha. This shows that use of fertilizers
is concentrated on foodcrops, especially rice. This situation is expected
to continue in the future as well.
9.        Of the total fertilized area in 1972, Java accounted for 3.6 mil-
lion ha (75%) and Sumatra for 0.92 million ha (19%). Thus, Java and Sumatra
accounted for about 94% of the total fertilizer area in 1972, with the rest
of the islands having very limited fertilizer area.
Per Hectare Fertilizer Consumption
10.       The following table shows the trend of per hectare fertilizer
consumption:
Fertilizer Consumption per Hectare of Arable Land
(kg)
N       P20           K 0
-     ~2 5          2
1959/60                   2.57      0.49         0.35
1971/72                  10.9       1.3          0.30
11.       The per hectare consumption of N and P 0  has increased significant-
ly since 1959/60.  However. K 0 consumption per hectare has remained more
2
or less stationary at a low level. However, in the future, the need for
K20 is also likely to increase to provide balanced fertilization. Field
trials have shown that the need for K20 is greater for estate crops than
for foodcrops.

12.       Comparison of fertilizer consumption/ha of arable land in 1971/72
among selected countries is provided in Table 4. It shows that the con-
sumption/ha is still one of the lowest in Indonesia, in spite of significant
increases in the recent past.
Fertilizer Consumption
13.       During 1964-1968, N consumption in Indonesia declined (Table 5)
from 108,200 tons to 101,200 tons mainly because of the scarcity of foreign
exchange to import fertilizers.  However, starting from a low base, P205 and
K20 consumption increased during that period. The following table shows the
trend of fertilizer consumption during 1964-1972:

1964-1972             13.8           8.1    24.0
14.       As shown in the above table, the increase in fertilizer consumption
has been particuarly significant since 1968, with the increased emphasis
on high-yielding seed varieties and agricultural development. During
1968-1972, N consumption grew at an average annual rate of 31%, while P 05
consumption expanded at the rate of 13% a year and K 0 consumption, at the
annual rate of 27%, starting from a low base.  The NP 20 :K 0 ratio has
changed from 8.8: 2.8:1 in 1968 to 10:1.7:1 in 1972 (Table 9) reflecting
relatively heavier concentration on N consumption.
15.       Of the total N consumption in 1972, the consumption by the foodcrop
sector was nearly 83%, with the estate sector using the rest. In the case
of P205 and K 0 consumption, about 67% and 2% respectively were in the food-
crop sector (iable 7). The following table shows the respective shares of
the foodcrop and estate sectors in the total consumption of different nutrients
during 1964-1972:

16.       Excluding 1968, when the supply of fertilizers in the estate sector
was severely curtailed because of limited imports, the share of the foodsector
in total N and P 0 consumption has changed marginally. However, its share
in total K 0 conLuaption has declined sharply. In absolute terms, the K 0
consumption by foodcrops during 1964-1972 declined from 800 tons to 600 ions,
while it rose rapidly in the estate crop sector from 4,800 tons to 29,800 tons
during the same period.
17.       The following table shows the average annual growth rate of fertil-
izer consumption of N and P 205 was significantly lower for the estate sector
than for the foodcrop sector. This is partly because of the Government
fertilizer allocation policy, with particular emphasis on the foodcrop sector,
and the foreign exchange constraint on fertilizer imports in general.
Fertilizer Consumption by Crops
18.       Of the total N consumption of 0.31 million in 1972 (Table 8), nearly
0.21 million tons or 67% was used on rice. Further, rice accounted for about
58.4% of the total P 20  consumption, but there was no use of K by that crop.
Excluding rice, the ma3or N consumers by order of importance were vegetables,
corn, rubber and sugarcane, and the major P205 consumers by order of importance



ANNEX 3
Page 5
were rubber, vegetables; sugarcane and oilpalm (Table 8).  In the case of K 20,
apart from rice, the non-users were corn, peanuts, soybean and cloves.
The major K 0 users by order of importance were oilpalm, rubber, sugarcane,
tea and cofiee.
Fertilizer Consumption by Region
19.       In 1972, about 242,120 tons or 79.3% of the total N consumption
were used in Java (Table 8).  That year, Java used 38,257 tons of P 205
(72% of total consumption) and 3,958 tons of K 0 (31.5% of total consumption).
Apart from Java, the major fertilizer consuming regions are Sumatra and
Sulawesi as shown in the following table:

20.       The above table shows that while Java is by far the leading user
of N and P 0  fertilizers, Sumatra is the most prominent user of K 20 ferti-
lizer. Sumaira being the leading producer of rubber and oilpalm, 2t needs
larger quantities of K 20 for use on them, especially in the northern part
of that island.
Imports of Fertilizer
21.       In terms of nutrients, N imports increased eightfold to 289,300 tons
during 1964-1972 (Table 9). During the same period, P20 imports rose nearly
fourfold to 93,300 tons and K20 imports increase 4-1/2 times to 35,800 tons.
The following table shows the trend of imports during 1964-1978:

22.       Among fertilizer materials imported, urea is the most important
followed by triple superphosphate (TSP), ammonium sulfate and diammonium
phosphate (DAP) as shown in the following table:

Production
23.       Indonesia had no local facility for fertilizer production until
1964, when PUSRI I went into commercial production with an annual production
capacity of 100,000 tons of urea. In the first year of operation itself,
PUSRI I achieved more than 100% capacity utilization. From 1964-1971,
PUSRI I was the only domestic fertilizer production facility in the country.
In August, 1972, Indonesia's second fertilizer facility - P. N. Petrokimia
Fertilizer Plant at Gresik, East Java-- went on stream. Petrokimia has a
58,000 TPY-capacity ammonia unit feeding two downstream units-- a 45,000 TPY
urea unit and a 150,000 TPY ammonium sulfate unit. The Petrokimia plant has
the flexibility to change the quantity of its main products--urea and ammonium
sulfate--according to the fertilizer market situation. However, it has
been facing problems in achieving high capacity utilization. Indonesia's third
fertilizer plant, PUSRI II, went into production in September 1974 with an
annual capacity to produce 380,000 TPY of urea. The country has so far no
production capacity for P 205 fertilizers.  As for K 20 fertilizer, the country



ANNEX 3
Page 7
has no known local reserves of potash. The following table shows the
trend of local fertilizer production during 1964-1974:

Future Production Plans
24.       Indonesia has firm plans to establish three N fertilizer plants:
PUSRI III, the East Kalimantan Plant I, near Balikpapan, and the West Java
Plant at Cikampek. Further, under preliminary stages of consideration are
two more plants: the North Sumatra Plant at Aceh; and the East Kalimantan
Plant II. The following table shows the main units, capacities and the
commissioning dates of the plants most likely to be built before 1983:
New N Plants by 1983
Ammonia            Urea Unit    Commissioning Dates

PUSRI III                    1,000             1,725         May 1, 1977
East Kalimantan I            1,500             1,725         January 1, 1978
West Java                    1,000             1,725          January 1, 1979
25.       All the above plants are expected to produce urea and have identical
urea capacity. However, the ammonia unit of the East Kalimantan I would be
larger than the comparable units of the other two plants. The surplus ammonia
capacity in the East Kalimantan I would be either used to provide industrial
ammonia for a proposed petrochemical plant in Surabaya or exported to the
Philippines. One of the unique features of East Kalimantan I is that it would
be preassembled in Europe on three ships to be installed ashore near Balik-
papan by dredging the area near the shore.



ANNEX 3
Page 8
26.       As for the local production of P205 fertilizers, Indonesia has plans
to build a TSP plant as part of the Petrokimia complex. This plant is ex-
pected to go into production on January 1, 1977 with an annual capacity of
200,000 tons of TSP. With respect to compound fertilizers, the country
has no firm plans for their local production.
27.       Assuming that all the new plants would be commissioned according
to schedule, the local production of fertilizers would increase (Table 10)
as follows:

Forecast of Demand
28.       Forecasts of fertilizer demand for Indonesia have been made in
several studies: (1) the National Fertilizer Study (NSF) by Agrar-und
Hydrotechnik GmbH, of the Federal Republic of Germany, published in 1972;
(2) the Feasibility Study for the West Java Fertilizer Plant by the Bureau
d'Etudes Industrielles et de Cooperation de l'Institut Francais du Petrole
(BEICIP), published in 1973/74; the draft reports, "The Likely Impact of
Middle East Oil Policies on the Development of the Nitrogen Industry of East
and Southeast Asia", January 1974, and "The Proposal for the Development of
the Nitrogen Production Capacity in Indonesia," July 1974-- both prepared by
the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID). Further, the Second Five-Year Plan (Pelita II, 1974-1979)
has forecast the demand for N fertilizers, and the Bank draft report, "The
Irrigation Survey Program for Indonesia," has projected the consumption of
N fertilizers for the rice crop in that country.



ANNEX 3
Page 9
29.       Forecasts by the various organizations show some variations,
with the most conservative projections in NSF and the most optimistic fore-
casts in Pelita II. These forecasts show that the demand in 1980 for N would
range from 562,000 tons to 1.17 million tons; for P205, from 146,000 tons to
295,600 tons; and for K20, from 79,900 tons to 181,200 tons (Table 11). The
following table shows the different projections for 1980:

JU.       BEICIP has forecast the demand under Case I and Case II, with low
and high ranges for each case. This has been done using high and low ranges
for per hectare consumption as well as total fertilized area for different
crops.



ANNEX 3

31.       To prepare the projection for this appraisal report, a set of BEICIP
assumptions regarding fertilized area and per hectare fertilizer consumption
which appear realistic considering the recent increases, have been used for
all crops except rice. As for rice, Bank's projections in "The Survey of
Irrigation Program" in Indonesia for N consumption, is used. Details of
fertilizer demand forecasts by crops are explained below.
Rice
32.       Indonesia receives annual rainfall in the range of 1,500-2,000 mm
in the main rice growing zones. While it is normally enough to grow a wet
season crop, rain distribution is variable and rainfed crops are often sub-
ject to drought or floods. Dry season rice production is not possible without
irrigation. Rice production is concentrated on the fertile volcanic and
alluvial soils of Java and Bali, which account for about 60% of the cropped
area. The other major rice-growing regions are Sumatra, Kalimantan and
Sulawesi. It is currently produced on an estimated area of 7.1 million ha
dividend as follows:

7.1                                 8.4
33.       About 50% of the net rice production area (or 60% of the
annually cultivated area) is irrigated. About two-thirds of this area is in
Java and Madura. Irrigated rice accounted for about 80% of total rice
production of 13.4 million tons in 1973. Upland rice is grown on a shifting
or permanent cultivation basis on elevated land without bunds to retain water.
Swamp rice is grown in poorly drained coastal swamp areas, which are subject
to regular flooding.
34.       According to Bank projections, the net rice cultivated area would
increase (Table 12) from 8.4 million ha in 1973 to 9.4 million ha in 1981 (i.e.
at an annual average rate of 1.5%). During the same period, rice production
is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 3.2%, reaching 17.2
million tons in 1981. This forecast is based on the following assumptions
(Table 13): (1) the high-yielding varieties would spread to 5.7 million ha
of irrigated and rainfed rice by 1981 compared to 2.3 million ha in 1973 and
the per capita N consumption in those areas would increase gradually to 90 kg
per ha in 1981 compared to 81 kg per ha in 1973; (2) the area under local



ANNEX 3
Page 11
varieties would decline from 1.8 million ha of the irrigated and rainfed area
in 1973 to 0.7 million ha in 1981, and the per ha N consumption in such area
would rise from 36 kg per ha to 40 per ha during the same period; (3) though
currently no N is used on upland rice, in future N fertilizers would be used
on part of the upland rice area; by 1981, the fertilized area under upland
rice is expected to reach 360,000 ha and the average N consumption per ha
would be about 40 kg; and (4) no N consumption is expected on swamp rice.
The following table shows the projected N consumption by rice based on the
above assumptions.

35.       The projection for N fertilizer demand in "The Survey of
Irrigation Program" goes only up to 1981. Extrapolating the 1978-1981
average annual growth of 7% for 1982 and 1983, the N fertilizer consumption
in those two years are projected at 595,500 tons and 637,600 tons respectively.
36.       The above Bank projection of N fertilizer consumption by the rice
crop is slightly higher than the upper limit of the projections by BEICIP
(Table 11).  Assuming the same N:P205:K20 ratio as used by BEICIP in its
"high" level forecasts, the consumption of P 205 and K20 by rice is forecast
to grow as follows:
N : P : K Ratio         Consumption by Rice
N    P20 5   KO2
1972                           1:0.15:0                204.8   30.9       -

Other Food Crops
37.       As already noted, for other food crops as well as estate crops
(e.g., rubber, tea, coffee, etc.), projections of fertilizer requirements
in this report are based on the BEICIP study, choosing the most realistic
among the alternative assumptions regarding the fertilizer area and dosages
used by BEICIP. Based on this approach, projections have been made for dif-
ferent crops in the following pages.
38.       Corn:  In 1972, about 556,000 ha were fertilized under corn.  The
acreage under this crop is expected to increase to about 593,500 ha by 1978
and 708,000 ha by 1983. The following table shows the break-up of the total
acreage into HYV and non-HYV using areas:
Corn: Fertilized Area
('000 Ha)
1972 (Actual)       1978        1983
HYV                    -                  186.8      233.4
Non-HYV              556.0               406.7       474.6
556.0               593.5       708.0
39.       In 1972, the use of fertilizers on corn was on the average about
41.6 kg of N and 0.4 kg of P205. The projected N consumption per ha for
1978 is 90 kg for HYV and 50 kg for non-HYV varieties. These dosages are
expected to hold good for 1983 as well.  As for P 205 and K 20, the dosages on



ANNEX 3
Page 13
an average (for HYV as well as non-HYV) are expected to be 20 kg and 0 kg
respectively in 1978, rising to 40 kg and 20 kg respectively in 1983.
40.       On the above assumptions, the fertilizer requirements for corn
in 1978 and 1983 would be:

1983          44.74      28.32      14.16
41.       Soybean:  In 1972, the fertilized area under soybean was 11,600 ha
and the dosage used per ha on an average was 20.3 kg of N and 6.7 kg of P 05.
(There was no K 20 use). The fertilized area is expeced to increase sharply5
to 125,800 ha in 1978 and 177,900 ha in 1983. The dosages expected to be
used in 1978 and 1983 are given below:

42.       Based on the above assumptions for fertilizer acreage and dosages,
the total fertilizer requirements for soybeans in 1978 and 1983 are projected
as follows:

43.       Vegetables:  In 1972, the fertilized area under vegetables was
225,900 ha and it is expected to increase to 278,200 ha in 1978 and 344,300 ha
in 1983. The fertilizer dosages assumed for 1978 and 1983 along with the
actual for 1972 are given below:

It is expected to increase to about 51,300 ha in 1978 and 106,200 ha in 1983.
The expected fertilizer dosages for 1978 and 1983 compared with the actual for
1972 are shown below:

It is expected to increase to 519,300 ha in 1978 and 570,000 ha in 1983
exclusively because of the new planting/rehabilitation program for small
holders. The following table shows the break-up of the projected fertilized

50.       In 1972, the average fertilizer dosages per hectare of oilpalm
estates were:  39.8 kg of N, 17 kg of P 205 and 98.9 kg of K20.  The following
dosages are assumed for the future:

52.       Sugarcane:  It is assumed that the harvested area in Java will not
change during 1972-1983. In the outer islands, the harvested area would not
change during 1972-1978 but would increase during 1978-1983 by 60,000 ha.
Further, it is assumed that all the harvested area under sugarcane would
continue to be fertilized as shown below:

53.       Based on the above assumptions, the fertilizer requirements of
sugarcane are expected to increase as follows:

1983            23.04       9.44    17.52
54.       Tea:  In 1972, about 5,290 tons of N, 910 tons of P 20  and 1,440
tons of K20 were used by tea plantations (at the ratio of 6:1:1.5).  That
year, the total production of tea was 70,000 tons of which 35,000 tons were
exported and the rest consumed locally. Exports are expected to grow at the
rate of 2.5% a year and production fcr domestic use at 3% a year. On this
basis, the total production during 1972-1983 would increase as follows:
Tea Production
1972 (actual)   1978         1983
For export                 35,000           40,850      46,500
For local use              35,000           41,800      48,500
70,000           82,650      95,000
55.       The incremental production is expected to be 12,650 tons during
1972-78 and 12,350 tons during 1983-1983. Assuming that 1 ton of N helps
produce 10 tons of tea, the incremental fertilizer requirements during
1972-1978 would be 1,265 tons and during 1978-1983, about 1,235 tons. Based
on these assumptions, the total requirements of N for tea cultviation would
be 6,555 tons in 1978 and 7,790 tons in 1983. Further, assuming that the
N, P905, K 0 consumption ratio for tea would be 6:2:3 in the future, the
totaI requirements of the nutrients would be:

56.       Coffee:  The area planted under coffee was 398,814 ha in 1972, of
which the estates accounted for 45,514 ha and the rest by smallholders. All
the area under estates are fertilized, but no fertilizers are used by small-
holders. It is assumed that the present area under estates would remain
unchanged in the future, while the area planted by smallholders would increase
at the rate of 2% a year from 353,300 ha in 1972, reaching 397,870 ha in 1978
and 439,300 ha in 1983. It is assumed that of the total planted area by
smallholders, 1% (4,000 ha) will be fertilized in 1978 and 2.5% (11,000 ha)
in 1983. All the area under estates would continue to be fertilized. The
fertilizer dosages assumed for estates and smallholders are as follows:

57.       Based on the above assumptions for fertilized area and fertilizer
dosages--separately for estates and smallholders--the total fertilizer
requirements by the coffee crop would be:

58.       Tobacco:  The planted area under tobacco in 1972 was 129,800 ha of
which 77,100 ha was fertilized--13,800 ha under estates and 63,300 ha under
small holdings. The planted area under tobacco is expected to remain un-
changed. However, the fertilized area would change slightly as follows:

59.       The average fertilized dosage per ha for estates in 1972 was 54 kg
of N, 4 kg of P 205 and 19.5 kg of K(20, and for smallholding was 80 kg of N
but no P 20 and K 0. The dosage for smallholdings is expected to remain un-
changed. Aowever, the dosage for estates would change to 54 kg each of the
three nutrients in 1978 and remain constant at that level.
60.       Based on the above assumptions for tobacco fertilized acreage and
dosages, the total fertilizer requirements would be:

61.       Cloves: The planted area under cloves in 1972 was 86,100 ha of
which 43,000 ha was fertilized. The fertilized area is expected to increase
to 54,500 ha in 1978 and 65,800 ha in 1983.  Only N and P 20  are used on
cloves at present.  The dosage in 1972 was 32 kg of N and 28 kg of P 05 o
The dosage is expected to increase to 40 kg of N, 20 kg of P 0 and 20kg of
K20 in 1978, and to 60 kg of N and 30 kg each of P 205 and K26 in 1983.
62.       Based on the above assumptions of fertilized area and dosages,
the total fertilized requirements by cloves is expected to increase as
follows:

63.       Coconuts:  The planted area under coconuts was 1.64 million ha in
1972 but no fertilizer was used on it. The planted area is expected to
increase to 1.8 million ha by 1978. About 80,000 ha would be fertilized
in 1978 at the average dosage per ha of 20 kg each of N, P 0 and K 0. The
fertilized area would rise further to 160,000 ha by 1983 w9enA the average
dosage per ha would be 30 kg each of No P 0 and K 0. On the above assumptions
of fertilizer area and dosages, the fertiiizer requirements would be:

64.       Pepper:  The planted area under pepper was 47,100 ha in 1972 when
no fertilizer was used on it. However, about 15,800 ha are expected to be
fertilized in 1978 when the dosage per ha would be 100 kg of N and 50 kg each
of P 0 and K 20. The fertilized area would increase further to 31,500 ha in
1983kwRen the dosage would be 120 kg of N and 60 kg deach of P 0  and K 0.
Based on the above assumptions, the fertilizer requirements are expected to
increase as follows:

65.       Based on the above forecasts, the total fertilizer requirements in

Trade in Fertilizers
66.       As already noted, Indonesia has no known reserves of K20.  There-
fore, it is assumed that the country would meet all its requirements of K 0
from imports. In the case of phosphates, Indonesia has plans as mentioned
earlier to establish only one plant with a production capacity of 200,000 TPY
of TSP (92,000 TPY of P205). Therefore, the country would largely depend
on imports to meet its phosphate needs. In the case of N fertilizers,
however, Indonesia is projected to emerge as an exporter from 1979 onwards
as shown below:

/1   The surplus would reach about 557,600 tons of N by 1983 if
Indonesia builds by the end of this decade two more
urea plants each of 570,000 TPY of urea capacity
(262,200 TPY of N) in addition to the three new urea
plants assumed in the projections.



ANNEX 3

67.       In studying the export possibilities for N fertilizers, it is
assumed that Indonesia has a relative advantage compared to Japan and the
Republic of Korea - its major Asian competitors for N fertilizer exports - in
meeting the import needs of neighboring countries such as Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand and the Republic of Vietnam because of Indonesia's
large resources of low-cost feedstocks for N production combined with modern
production facilities and freight advantage. As for potential competition
especially from the Persian Gulf countries, it is assumed that those countries
would be better off by concentrating on meeting the import needs of countries
other than Indonesia's neighbors mentioned above.
68.       Tables 15-21 show the TVA projections of production and demand
of N fertilizers in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the Republic of
Vietnam, Japan and the Republic of Korea. The production and demand
projections for Indonesia are already given (para 66). Based on the data
from these tables, it is forecast that the surplus deficit of N in those
countries would be as follows:

Total Surplus        +708   +599   +594   +5h0    +33
/1   Two fertilizer plants are expected to be closed at the
end of 1980 as they would be fully depreciated by then.
69.       The above forecasts of surplus/deficit in the selected countries
are based on the assumption that before 1983: (1) Korea and Japan - which
for N production have to depend heavily on imported feedstocks the price
for which has risen steeply - would not build new plants except those already
under construction; (2) Malaysia and the Philippines would build one ammonia/
urea plant each with a capacity of 570,000 TPY of urea (262,200 TPY of N);
and (3) Vietnam would build an ammonia/urea plant with a capacity of 330,000
TPY of urea (151,800 TPY of N). The above table shows the surplus available
from Japan, Korea and Indonesia would fall short of the import requirements
of Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam from 1980 onwards. How-
ever, an approximate balance would be achieved by 1983 in case Indonesia
builds two more plants in addition to the three new plants assumed.

Fertilizer Marketing
70.       Fertilizer marketing in Indonesia is carried out by Government
approved importers/distributors including local fertilizer producers like
PJSRI and Petrokimia.  Until 1970, P.N. Pertani was the leading distri-
butor of both local and imported fertilizers.  However, in recent years, the
Government has been encouraging local producers to market their own products
as well as imported fertilizers while allowing P.N. Pertani and other
established importer/distributors to continue their operation. As the
local production of fertilizers is low (about 318,000 product tons in 1974),
the marketing network in Indonesia depends heavily on imports.
71.       The Government controls not only fertilizer distribution but
also fertilizer prices. The main purpose of price control is to subsidize
fertilizer sales to farmers and keep foodgrain prices low in a bid to check
inflation which has been a serious problem in Indonesia. The retail price
of urea - both local and imported - is fixed at Rp 60,000 (US$144.6) per
product ton while the current import price of urea - the most popular
fertilizer used in the country - is about Rp 176,000 per ton.  Of the
retail fertilizer price of Rp 60,000 per product ton, Rp 5,000 (8%) is the
margin for sub-distributors and retailers and Rp 13,100 (22%) is the margin
for importers/distributors. The Government purchases all the local production
of urea at a fixed price before allocating it for distribution. This price
was very low in the past, making it difficult for local producers to earn a
reasonable return on investment. However, the Government has increased itLs
purchase price by stages from Rp 28,220 (US$68.0) per Droduct ton in 1972 to
Rp 63,900 (US$154) in 19714. The purchase price is fixed on the basis of
c.i.f. Java. Therefore, the producers have to bear the cost of transporting
their product to port godowns in Java, the leading fertilizer consuiming area.
Credit
72.       Over 60% of the fertilizer is consumed in Indonesia in areas
covered by two programs for promoting intensive cultivation, especia)ly
of rice: the BIMAS (Mass Guidance) program and the INMAS (Mass Intensifica-
tion) program. UJnder the BIMAS program, farmers having less than 5 ha of
land are provided with short-term credits at 1% interest per month in the
form of a package of subsidized inputs supplemented with extension services
to promote the proper use of these inputs. The INMAS program in prac(tice
represents the ordinary agricultural extension program for the distribution
of subsidized inputs to farmers who are either ineligible for the BIMAS
program (either because they have progressed sufficiently as BIMAS farmers
or because they have more than 5 ha of land) or who do not want to make use
of the BIMAS credit because of the associated red-tape and control. The
INMAS participants, unlike the BIMAS farmers, have freedom of choice
regarding the types and quantities of inputs. However, the INMAS farmers
are charged a higher rate of interest--currently 1.5% per month--than the
BIMAS farmers.

73.       The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) is now the sole credit agency
for these programs and is attempting to set up offices to process loan.
aDplications in each village unit (unit desa).  Village units without a BRI
office are covered by mobile units. Farmers participating in BINAS and INMAS
programs have to receive vouchers for inputs from BRI offices or mobile units
and draw supplies against them in village "kiosks" operated by approved
nrivate retai.lers or from village unit cooperatives (BWlD 's).  It is -the
Government policy to promote the BUUD's as the main sources of supply of
;.nputs for BIMAS and INMAS farmers.  But there is a lack of trained person-
nel to organize and operate them.  Ther-fore, BUUD's require considerable
s-trengthening before they could become efficient suppliers.
PITSRI Marketing
7)V.      Initially, PUSRI was marketing most. of its products through P.N.
Pertani. For example, in 196)i, the first year of operation, RPSRI w'ilarketed
about 90% of its production through Pertani and sold the rest through its
rmarketing organization.  The percentage of production sold t.hrough Pertani
*leclined gradually during 1961i-1970, with PUSRI assuming thte enti1re respon-
sibility for marketing its own products in 1970 and, at the same time,
becoming the most important distributor and importer of fertilizers.
I-However, by 1978, Indonesia is expected to overcome the need for imports
of U1 fertilizers.
Currently, PUSRI marketing of imported fertilizers is greater thati
it ;s own produiction.  For example, in 1974, fertilizers imported and marketed
by PUSRI were nearly three times its own production. As already noteO, the
Government allows a margin of Rp 13,100 per ton to PTJSRI for serving as an
importer/distributor. But this margin is inadequate under the current system
of credit sales because it takes about 10 months for PUSRI to realize its
receivables. Meanwhile, PUSRI has to borrow short-term funds from banks
at an interest of 1 to 2% per month. As a result, PUJSRI's marketing operation
used to be carried out at a financial loss to the Company. However, the
Gxovernment has undertaken since 1974 to make up PUSRI's marketing losses
through cash advances as long as the existing distribution control system
continues. Further, the Government has agreed to insure a reasonable
return on the assets in service of the marketing department once the
proposed transportation and distribution project is implemented.
76.       About 80% of PUSRI's own production is sold in Java.  This
percentage is expected to decline as the volume of production by PUSRI
increases and as it increases its sales in other islands of Indonesia,
especially Sumatra and Sulawesi.

1/    1962-1972 FAO/TVA figures of actual consumption and production.
2/    Significant increases in consumption already occurred in 1973
and forecast to rise again,in 1974 and 1975. Assumes food
stabilization 1976 onward.
3/    Japan has already announced a cutback in production and eventually
will phase out of export market. The current oil shortage coupled
with planned cutbacks will reduct Japan's total nitrogen production
in 1974 by at least 16 percent. (Forecast December 19, 1973)
4/    Therefore a sharp drop in Japanese exports can be expected in 1974,
caused by both an increase in consumption and a drop in production.
Also note trade balance figures may not necessarily agree with
official export figures because not all production is exported
in year produced and also some imports occur which are not recorded
here.

ANNEX 4-2
INDONESIA: PUSRI FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
PRODUCTION PROCESS AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Production Process
1.        The rated capacity of the plant will be 1,725 TPD of urea, i.e.,
570,000 TPY assuming 330 days of operation in a year. Actual output, if
approximately 92% on-stream efficiency is maintained, will be about
522,000 TPY. The intermediate ammonia production facilities are sized
on the basis that all ammonia produced will be converted to urea. The
ammonia unit will have a 1,000 TPD rated capacity, i.e., 330,000 TPY.
2.        Gas from PERTAMINA and STANVAC gasfields will be used for both
process and fuel and will be supplied to the plant at a pressure of around
600 psig as required for direct steam reforming without further pressure
boosting. It will be the responsibility of PERTAMINA to supply and install
the necessary gas pipeline up to the works from the existing high pressure
transmission line (see Annex 4-4).
hverage comoosition of the gas is exnected to be as below:
(% of volume)
Methane                     75.1
Ethane                       6.0
Propane                      h.9
Isobutane                    0.9.
Butane                       0.8
Isopenthane                  0.5
Penthane                     O.L,
Exane and Higher             1.0
Carbon Dioxide              10.3
Nitrogen                     0.1
100. 0
The gas is almost sulfur-free. Producers of the gas remove liquified
hydrocarbons in the gas-fields so that the pipeline gas contains less
than 2 LUS gal0/l,000 cu.ft. of liquified hydrocarbons.
3.        Synthesis gas for ammonia production is produced from the feed
gas in a series of steps beginning with a primary refor:ing with steam.
Here, desulfurized gas is combined with superheated steam in an amount
approximately equal to a 3 to 1 steam/carbon ratio.  The combined stream
at, a pressure of approximately 500-550 psig is then preheated to about
950 degrees F and passed through catalyst-filled 25/20 chrome-nickel
alloy tubes suspended in the radiant section of the reformer. In passing
through the tubes, the hydrocarbon components, miostly methane, are partly
converted to carbon oxides and hydrogen and exit at a temperature normally
in excess of 1,500 degrees F. The partially reformed gas then flows to a



ANMEX h-2
Page 2
secondary reformer where it is mixed with preheated air in a quantity
necessary to reform the unconverted hydrocarbons and at the same time
provide the required amount of nitrogen for ammonia synthesis. Air
required for the secondary reforming step is supplied from a centrifugal
steam-turbine-driven compressor.
4.        Reformed gas from the secondary reformer now containing less
than about 0.4% methane is cooled in waste heat boilers down to about
700 degrees F prior to introduction to the high temperature shift converter
where part of the carbon monoxide content of the gas is converted to carbon
dioxide by reaction with steam with an equivalent production of hydrogen.
To complete this conversion of carbon monoxide, the gas after cooling in
additional waste heat boilers and after a protective fine sulfur removal
is introduced into a second stage low temperature converter where the
carbon monoxide content of the gas is reduced to about 0.5%.
5.        The raw synthesis gas now contains essentially hydrogen, nitrogen,
carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and
goes through a series of purification steps to provide an ammonia synthesis
gas with a hydrogen/nitrogen rate of 3 to 1 In the first of these,carbon
dioxide is removed by any of a number of proprietary liquid scrubbing pro-
cesses and then remaining carbon oxides are removed by conversion to methane
by reaction with hydrogen over a suitable catalyst. The final synthesis gas
then contains in addition to nigrogen and hydrogen, less than about 10 ppm
oxides, the maximum which can be tolerated by the ammonia synthesis catalyst,
and small amounts of methane which are continually purged from the following
ammonia synthesis loopo
6c        The carbon dioxide removed from the crude synthesis gas is re-
generated from the rich liquid absorbent and is subsequently reacted with
ammonia to form urea0 The composition of the natural gas is such that the
quantity of carbon dioxide produced in the gas reforming process described
will be sufficient for urea production.
7.        In the synthesis of ammonia the nitrogen hydrogen mixture is
comprressed to a pressure of 2,500-3,000 psiF by a steam turbine driven
2 or 3 case centrifugal compressor with recycle gas containing about ll.
ammonia being admitted to an interstage wheel. The compressed discharge
gas after water coolinv is then refrigerated and condensed ammonia removed
in a liquid separator before the gases now containing only about 25, ammonia
are reheated by heat exchange and passed to the ammonia converter. This
vessel is of a special design containing e catalyst to promote the :.ynthesis
reaction and special provision for removal of the reaction heat developed,
so as to maintain optimum reaction temperature. The effluent gas is cooled
from the reaction temperature of about 00 degrees F first in preheating
boiler feed water and then by heat exchange with incoming converter feed
gas, before recycling in the synthesis gas compressor as described.

8.        Liquid ammonia produced in the process will be stored.in a
refrigerated liquid ammonia storage tank having a capacity of about
5-day production or some 5,000 tons.
9.        In the production of urea, amTonia and carbon dioxide are
combined at a pressure of 2,000 - 3,500 psig and a temperature of approxi-
mately 360 degrees F when anmoniuiri carbamate is formed as an intermediate
product, which is subsequently dehydrated to form urea. Neither of these
reactions, however, proceeds to completion with the result that the re-
action product consists of a urea/ammonium carbamate solution containing
large quantities of dissolved. ammonia and carbon dioxide. The next step
in the production of urea, therefore, is to separate the non-converted
carbamate and reaction gases and recycle them to the reactor, and the
means of doing this represents the major distinction between the various
processes commercially available. In one commonly used process, the
pressure of the reaction products is reduced in steps with consequent
decomposition of carbamate back into carbon dioxide and ammonia which
are then redissolved by countercurrent absorption and recycled back to
the reactor. In another process, the decomposition is achieved without
reduction in pressure by stripping the solution leaving the reactor with
carbon dioxide and in another process a similar stripping process is used
employing gaseous ammonia. In all these processes, the final urea solution
is concentrated by evaporation and then in most cases prilled directly,if a
biuret concentration of up to 1% percent can be tolerated, or,.after vacuum
crystalization, if a low biuret Y grade is required..
B. Plant Facilities
10.       PUSRI III will be built adjacent to PUSRI II, partly on land
already prepared for PUSRI II and. partly on land recently purchased
(about 20 ha) for PUSRI III. This additional land requires sand filling
to the extent of about 540,000 cubic meters. The main parts of the project
are: (1) a natural gas pretreatment section for the removal of heavy hydro-
carbons, carbon dioxide and sulfur compounds from the feed gas; (2) a
1,000 TPD ammonia plant; (3) a 1,725 TPD urea plant; (4) an ammonia storage
tank; (5) cooling towers for recirculating plant cooling water; (6) water
treating facilities designed to produce high-purity demineralized.water;
(7) a gas turbine generator designed to produce 15.MW of power, with
facilities for heat recovery for steam generation; (8) a bag-making plant
with a capacity to produce 20 million bags a year; and (9) expansion of
the existing jetty to facilitate loading of YUSRI III products onto ships
specially designed. for bulk transportation. About 80/ of PUSRI III urea
would be transported in bulk to the reception and bagging stations of the
Company. The rest of the production woul.d be bagged at Palembang itself
and shipped in the Regular Liner Service (RLS) vessels to smaller markets
in the outer islands.
1/    Less than 0.5% of biuret.

C. Pollution Control
11       Special attention will be given during design and specifications
for the facilities to minimize the emission and/or discharge of noxious
waste materials. Wherever possible, these materials would be recycled
within the process units. Further, the design of the process umits will
be in accordance with European and U.S. standards with respect to the
composition of liquid and gaseous effluents. Under these conditions and
with the added advantage of having a clean, almost sulfur-free gas feed-
stock, it is expected that the proposed project will have little or no
harmful effects on the environment0

INDONESIA: PUSRI FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
GAS GATIERING AND TRANSMISSION
1.       PPUSRI urea production is based on natural gas.  The old plant,
PUSRI I, receives its gas requirements - 12 million SCF per day - from
STANVAC gasfields under a 20-year contract which expires in 1983, A new
gas gathering and transmission system with a capacity of 116 million SCF/
day has been developed by PERTAMINA at a total cost of about Rp 16 billion
(US$ 39 million), financed by the Government to meet the gas requirements
of PUSRI II, According to the original plan, 42 million SCF/day was to
be supplied to PUSRI II and the remaining 34 million SCF/day was proposed
to be supplied to two refineries of PERTA1INA and two power-generating
plants at Palembang. However, because of the proposed PUSRI III plant,
PERTANfINA has been instructed by the Government to supply all the gas frori
the existing s,.rsten (116 million/day), if necessary, to meet fully PUSLIIs
expanded needs. This would require a pipelir,e looping over 12 km (using
30.5 cm pipes) from Simpiang to PUSRI III to supply its need estimated
at 60 million SCF/day of gas. PERTANINA reportedly has already placed
orders with foreign suppliers for pipes for the looping work.
20        PERTAI4INA is also planning to develop a new gas gathering and
transmission system to meet the needs of the above mentioned refineries
and power plants and also have a reserve capacity to meet the future
needs of PUSRI. This system is expected to cost about US$ 50 million,
and would be financed by the Government. It would consist of a 20.5 cm
diameter, 47 km pipeline connecting the gasfields of Musi Block to the
gasfields at Nau and Teras and a 30.5 cm diameter, 81 km pipeline from
the latter to Cambai where the new system would be linked with the exist-
ing system. The proposed network would be implemented by PERTAMINA using
its own staff supported by an experienced local engineermng firm.
Gas Reserves
3.        The following table shows the gas reserves in South Sumatra
available for the existing and the proposed gas gathering and transmission
systems:

4.        The proven reserves available for the existing system are
estimated at 856 billion SCF of which about 30% would be accounted for
by field uses (e.g., compressors, etc.) and field losses. Thus net
proven reserves available for supply to PUSRI would be about 600 billion
SFC wrhich would be adequate to meet the needs of PUSRI II and III
(102 million SCF/day) for about 16 years. In addition, there are an
estimated 155 billion SCF probable reserves at Prabumulih gasfields
served by the existing system.

1/  PUSRI I is assumed to be closed after 1976 because of its age.
3. Urea Price
The Government purchases all the production of local urea at a
fixed price, on a c.i.f. Java basis. The current price (since November
1974) is Rp 63,900 (US$154) per ton, of which about Rp 8,000 (US$19.3) per
ton is the allowance for transporting fertilizer to Uava.  Thus, the ex-
factory price works out to Rp 55,900.  This price has been used. to project
the Companyts production revenue, assuming it would not be changed before 1977.
The Government subsidizes the sale of urea - local as well as
imported. It has fixed the retail price of urea at Rp 60,000 (US$144.6)
per ton, which includes a margin of 22% for distributors and 8% for sub-
distributors and retailers. This price is assumed to remain constant.
4. TIput Costs
The costs of all inputs except gas for PUSRI I and PUSRI II
are expressed in 1977 prices except for real increases in labor and
maintenance costs. The gas supply to PUSRI I is carried out under a
fixed price contract and. for PUSRI II under a formula which links the gas
price to the operating costs (including financial charges) plus two US cents
per MSCF gas to cover PERTANiINA's overhead, thus allowing for a gradual
decrease in the gas price as the burden of financial charges declines with
debt repayments,
As the operating costs of the gas distribution system are not
expected to increase significantly because of inflation up to 1977, the
gas costs for them have not been escalated. With respect to polypropylene
bags, the import price nearly doubled to US 50 cents per bag in 197h. This
price is not expected to further increase significantly up to 1977. PUSRI
is expected to start manufacturing such bags from 1977 onwards. .The price
for each of these bags is also assumed to be US 50 cents for PUSRI use and
US 60 cents for outside sales.



ANNEX 6-1
Page 2
Gas Price: Natural gas is supplied. to PUSRI I by STANVAC at the
fixed. price of Rp 79 (about 19 US cents)ASCF. In the case of PUSRI II,
which gets its gas supply from PERTAMINA at cost, the gas price decreases
from year to year as the burden of debt servicing on PERTAMINA declines.
The following gas prices have been used for PUSRI II:
GAS PRICEAISCF for PUSRI II

1975       91T.o           22.7

1981       67.0            16.1
1982       63.0            15.2
The price mechanism for gas supply to PUSRI III has not yet been finalized..
It is assumed for the projections that the price would be about Rp 250.
(US 60 cents)/MSCF; this is calculated on the basis that a new gas gathering
and transmission system in Indonesia would. require that price to cover all
costs and earn a reasonable return on investment.
Gas per Ton of Urea: It is assumed the old plant, PUSRI I, would
require 50 MSCF per ton of urea compared. to 34.7 MSCF per ton by PUSRI II
and PUSRI ITI.
Catalysts and Chemicals: The proposed PUSRI III with its larger
units of ammonia and urea would require less catalysts and chemicals per
ton of product than PUSRI II and PUSRI I. It is assumed that PUSRI III in
1977 would. require such items worth about Rp 623 (US$1.5) per ton of urea
compared to Rp 1,050 (US$2.5) per ton by PUSRI II and Rp 1,370 (US$3.3)
per ton by PUSRI I.
Maintenance Materials: The following table shows the maintenance
materials per ton of urea in the PUSRI I, II and III:
PUSRI  I              PUSRI  II               PUSRI  IIT
R-EP    US$            Rp     US$              Rp      US$

A real increase of 5% in maintenance material costs is assumed for PUSRI I.
Labor: The average base salary of PUSRI workers in 1974 was
Rp 45,000 (UST108.5) per month.  This is assumed. to increase at the rate



ANNEX 6-1
Page 3
of 15% a year during 1974 - 1977, reaching Rp 100,000 (US$241) in 1977.
Beyond 1977, a 2% increase in real wages is assumed for the projections.
The labor force of PUSRI T is 1,500 compared to 700 for PUSRI II and the
projected figure of 550 for PUSRI III.
5. Depreciation
The operating life of the project is assumed to be 12 years and
a straightline depreciation over that period is assumed. No depreciation
is charged on land and the initial working capital.
6. Taxes
PUSRI is allowed to carry forward losses for five years for tax
purposes.  Further, there is a 5-year tax holiday on the profit of new
projects undertaken by PUSRI.
7.  Marketing Department Profit
During 1970 - 1973, the marketing department showed losses because
the margin on sales fixed by the Government was not adequate to cover all
the costs of the department.  However, beginning fro, 1974, the Government
has undertaken to make up the annual marketing lossces. Therefore, for the
purpose of projections, it has been assumed that the marketing department
would operate on a no-profit, no-loss basis as full data for the department
are not available prior to the completion of the appraisal of the proposed
shipping and distribution project.

Production Build-Up
1.        The ammonia/urea units as well as the bag-making plant of
PUSRI III are expected to go into production on May 1, 1977. About
80% of PUSRI III production would be transported in bulk and the rest
in bags. The bag-making plant would be not only producing bags for
PUSRI III but also for PUSRI II (which currently purchasesbags from
outside) and other consumers.
2.        With technical assistance from experienced foreign firms,
PUSRI III fertilizer facilities are expected to achieve high capacity
utilization as follows: first year, 75A; second year, 80%; and from
third year onwards, 90%. The bag-making plant would have an annual
capacity of 20 million bags. This plant would start operating at 70%
capacity in the first year, and subsequentlv produce enough bags to
meet the rwoeB of the PUSRI compLex and s=me outside consumers. The
following table shows the production build-up in the PUSRI III facilities:
