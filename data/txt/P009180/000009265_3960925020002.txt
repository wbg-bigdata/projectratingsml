PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA
FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1534-YU)
PREFACE
Presented here is a Project Completion Report for the Fifth
Yugoslav Railway Project for which a loan of US$100.0 million was approved
in March 1978. The loan was closed in September 1984 after cancellation of
US$473,944.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa region fromi information contained in a Project
Completion Report prepared for the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) by
the Transport Institute of Sarajevo and from data in project files.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
FolLowing standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
report to the Government and the Borrower. However, no comments have
been received from them.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1534-YU)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project covered the three-year slice, 1978-80, of the railways'
1976-80 Investment Plan. Within this project the loan was to be disbursed
against expenditures for track overhaul, electrification, technical assis-
tance and staff training (PCR, para. 2.10).
The project was originally intended to cover the years 1977-78
(PCR, para. 2.01), but delay in preparing feacibility studies and issues on
subsidies and tariffs resulted in a slowdown of the appraisal process until
the last quarter of 1976  (PCR, paras.  2.04 and 2.05).  Due to the same
issues not being resolved a second stage mission for completion of appraisal
in May 1977 and a third updating mission in October 1977 resulted in reform-
ulation of the project for the years 1978-80 (PCR, para. 2.05).
Physical progress with the nrctj'ct was slower than anticipated,
primarily for the following reasons: delay in procurement of track renewal
materials, and shortage of local funding caused by increasing difficulties
of the Yugoslav economy (PCR, paras. 3.04, 3.05 and 3.07). However, the
major part of* the investment plans was completed by 1981 with the result
that the railway freight traffic was able to increase by 23S from 1976-1981
(PCR, paras. 3.05 and 4.01).
The principal financial objectives of tne project were to switch
from subsidies to traffic related compensation payments by the users of the
railways and to reduce the railways' reliance on non-tariff revenue by in-
creasing  tariff revenues.   Such user  compensation  payments brought much
relief to the railway's liquidity position but after 1979 tariff revenues
were not able to keep pace with costs. In the face of inflationary pres-
sures and economic difficulties, Government approved tariff increases were
inadequate in the second half of the project period.  Although the tariff
objective was not achieved (PCR, paras. 5.03, 5.05, 5.09-5.11), the project
was successful in achieving its other major objectives by enabling the rail-
ways to improve its operational efficiency, its quality of service, and to
carry higher traffic volumes. Only the results achieved in availability of
locomotives were disappointing due largely to the country's difficult
foreign exchange position which caused a severe lack of funds for spare
parts (PCR, paras. 4.02 and 4.04). The consultancy assistance provided dur-
ing project preparation and implementation considerably helped institution
building (PCR, para. 6.04).



The re-evaluated economic returns for the project range from 15 to
30Z for track overhauls, around 15% for electrification and about 251 for
traction and rolling stock replacement. The overall ER is about 182 com-
pared to 15S at appraisal (PCR. para. 7.03).
The following points are of particular interest:
-   Division of Investment Plans into two parts (PCR, paras.  2.5
and 9.02).
- Physical progress of the project (PCR, paras. 3.04-3.08).
- Procurement (PCR, paras. 3.10, 3.12 and 9.04).
- Technical assistance (PCR. paras. 3.16, 3.21-3.23 and 9.05).
- Cost overrun (PCR, para. 3.26).
- Improvement in operational indicators (PCR, paras. 4.02, 4.03,
4.05 and 4.06); declining availability of locomotives (PCR,
paras. 4.04 and 9.07).
- 'ompensation payments (PCR, paras. 5.03, 5.04, and 9.06).
- Institution building (PCR, paras. 6.01-6.04).
- Economic rate of return (PCR, para. 7.03).
Major lessons learned from the project are:
1.   In a period of high inflation, tariff increases can at best
only be expected to offset the effects of inflation on costs.
As a result ,the dialogue between the Borrower and the Bank on
the reduction in compensation payments has continued into the
current Sixth Railwry Project.
2.   The division of the Investment Plans into two parts proved to
be a valuable measure in introducing flexibility into the plan-
ning process.
3.   The period of procurement in the implementation schedule was
not sufficient and should in future take into account the quite
substantial time needed to establish letters of credit.
4.   The lack of appropriate foreign exchange allocations for loco-
motive spare parts had a very negative impact on locomotive
availability.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1534-YU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Railways form an essential part of Yugoslavia's transport system
with the main trunk line running from Italy and Austria in the northwest to
Greece and Bulgaria in the southeast and main lines linking the trunk line
to the Adriatic coast. Although road transport now carries a bigger volume
of freight, the railways play a vital role in the economy as the principal
carrier of bulk materials over long and medium distances.  In the early
1960s the railways had experienced an extended period, going back to before
the Second World War, with only minimum investment. At that time, 2000 of
the system's 2,300 locomotives were steam driven and 70% were over 35 years
old, and two-thirds of the rolling stock was over-age. Stations, marshall-
ing yards and signalling systems were in urgent need of modernization.
1.02     In 1963, a First Railway Project from the Bank financed the con-
version of the Sarajevo-Ploce line to standard gauge with electric traction
and signalling. In 1964, a Bank loan was concluded for the Second Railway
Project to support the railways' 1964-70 Modernization Program. This was a
comprehensive program designed to modernize operations and equipment, in
particular the modernization of some 1500 km of main lines with track renew-
al, signalling, and electrification, the acquisition of motive power and
other equipment as well as the construction or extension of six major mar-
shalling yards. The project turned out to be ovfsr ambitious, and was beset
by  major  problems.   The  railways'  financial  performance  deteriorated.
Investment cost escalated due to inflation - whose effects were compounded
by delays of execution - and design changes. As a result, the Bank loan was
fully disbursed well before the Modernization Program was completed.   The
Third Yugoslav Railway Project, for which a loan was made in 1968, W-as for
the construction of the Belgrade-Bar line, a development project of great
technical complexity involving the construction of over 300 tunnels and
several major bridges.  Although the project was completed successfully,
there was a four-year delay because of technical difficulties, and soon
after the line was opened, traffic on the railway and through the port of
Bar was disrupted by the 1979 earthquake in Montenegro.
1.03     Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement
with the Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the rail-
ways with the assistance of consultants. This prepared the ground for the
Fourth Railway Project, agreed in 1974, under which the Bank's loan was al-
located to the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and to "Related
Investments" needed to maximize its benefits, all to be completed by the end
of 1976.  In contrast to earlier projects which consisted only of invest-
ments to which the Bank loan had been allocated, the fourth project was



-2-
defined as the totality of the railways' investments in 1974-76, whose cost
was estimated at US$1,138 million; the Bank loan thus amounted to about 122
of project cost and comprised one of the first Bank-financed sector
projects. Agreement was reached on measures to resolve the railways' finan-
cial problems, principally by tariff increases. An important feature of the
project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans which, given
Yugoslavia's decentralized system, were designed to contribute to a common
understanding of objectives and responsibility by all concerned.  Although
only about two-thirds of project investments were executed by the end of
1976, these were reasonably balanced to maximize system effects; the remain-
der were  included  in  the  1976-80  Investment  Plan.  Execution of  Bank-
financed "Related Investments" was substantially better (about 75%), and the
electrification of the main line traversing Yugoslavia from the Auscrian and
Italian borders to Skopje, near the Greek border was completed.
1.04     Yugoslav railways envisaged the Fifth Railway Project as a major
contributor to their principal objective of improving further the efficiency
and the competitive position of the railways mainly through track overhaul
of about 1,400 km of main lines and electrification of about 300 km of high
density routes.
1.05     This Project Completion Report is based on a report provided by the
Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) in May 1984, project supervision and on
a review of the Bank's files in Washington.



II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Origin
2.01     The Bank first considered the project in August 1974 in the course
of supervision of the Fourth Railway Project. In December 1974, a mission
visited Yugoslavia to discuss the basic framework within which a loan for
the Fifth Railway Project could be made. The main points were that the
project would probably cover ths 1977-78 slice of the railways' 1976-80
Investment Plans and would require the completion of feasibility studies for
specific items and the preparation of plans for the railways' total invest-
ment program.  It was intended that draft Investment Plans be available by
mid-1975 to provide information for the National Investment Plan for
1976-80.   In the meantime,  the railway authorities agreed to prepare by
April 1975 unofficial draft Investment Plans for 1977-78.
Preparation and Appraisal
2.02     A preparation mission in June 1975 reviewed the draft Investment
Plans for 1976-80. They showed substantial increases in annual investments
compared with actual expenditures in previous years and with the 1977-78
timeslice  previously  submitted  to  the  Beak.   The  mission  advised  the
Yugoslav railways to reduce these plans and to avoid large variations be-
tween successive years. Even after proposed reductions in the plans, the
foreign exchange component of items suggested for Bank financing was esti-
mated about US$250 million, far in excess of the tentative loan allocation
of US$40 million. The mission emphasized the importance of securing paral-
lel financing in order to meet the foreign exchange gap.
2.03     Yugoslav Railways engaged French consultants to assist in the prep-
aration of some pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, which were designed
to serve as models for the remainder to be carried out by the railways.
Consultancy services were financed by the Bank from the Fourth Railway
Project. During the June 1975 mission it was agreed with the Community of
Yugoslav Railways (CYR) that investment plans, financing plans, action
plans, income accounts, cash flows, balance sheets and various statistical
data and targets were to reach the Bank by October 1975, while final reports
on feasibility studies were to be available in November and December of
1975. On that basis, it had been hoped to start appraisal in late November
1975. However, delays in project preparation led to re-scheduling of the
appraisal mission for mid-January 1976. Subsequent uncertainties about co-
financing and tariff increases under the Fourth Railway Project as well as
to a proposed new Social Agreement on Railway Development led to further
postponements in the appraisai mission during 1976 (para. 2.04).
2.04     In May 1976, a preparation mission discussed in detail the issues
of tariffs and ad hoc payments (subsidies) and recommended a further tariff
increase in 1976. The mission also noted from the draft Social Agreement on
Railway Development, that the Investment Plans now of about 38 billion
Dinars (US$2.2 billion) at 1975 prices were significantly less than the pro-
posals of about 50 million Dinars (US$2.9 billion) made at the time of the
June  1975  mission.   It  was  agreed with Yugoslav  railways,  that  these



- 4 -
Investment Plans would be further revised to make them consistent with the
results of the feasibility studies and the revised operational plans, nota-
bly those concerned with traction and rolling stock, and signalling and
telecommunications.
2.05     An appraisal mission visited Yugoslavia  in October/November 1976
and attempted to clarify with all relevant: Yugoslav authorities the key
issues concerning Government support measures and their effect on traffic.
The main issues continued to relate to railway tariffs and subsidies, to the
financing of the project, and to the size of the proposed Bank loan.  The
mission recommended as a first step that project processing should not pro-
ceed beyond the end of February 1977 without a decision to make an adequate
tariff increase; and that a loan condition shculd be that compensation pay-
ments should decrease by at least 33S in real terms between 1976 and 1980.
The mission also recommended that revised appraisal documentation be pre-
pared by the railways on the basis of an average annual increase in traffic
units of not more than 42 between 1976 and 1980; and that steps should be
taken to improve productivity and the utilization of railway assets, which
would have to be reflected in targets to be agreed on the basis of statis-
tical data to be provided by the railways. Figures put forward by the rail-
ways showed that the investment funds identified firmly so far, covered
about 60% of the 1976-80 Investment Plans and of the proposed 1978-80 time-
slice for the project. The mission, therefore, recommended the Investments
Plans to be divided into two parts, Part A containing priority investments
for which funds were assured and Part B which included other items of lower
priority. The loan allocation was US$65 million, 31 of the cost of the
project. To obtain adequate leverage throughout the railways, the mission
pointed out that the Bank had to demonstrate its interest in the development
of each of the eight Railway Transport Organizations (RTOs) by making a
significant contribution to their investments, and recommended that the loan
allocation should be increased to US$100 million, still only about 52 of the
project.
2.06     A second stage appraisal mission went to Yugoslavia in May 1977 for
the completion of appraisal. By this time, the Governumnt had indicated its
intention to replace subsidies by payments by Communities of Interest (COIs)
consisting of railway users (para. 5.03). This was regar4ed as a major step
forward because government subsidies would be replaced by a f^rm of user
charges. The mission had found that the conditions for appraisal had been
met. At that time, the revised lending program projposed a loan of US$100
million  and an appraisal  report was  prepared on  that basis.   A  post-
appraisal mission took place in October 1977 primarily to review the new
Social Agreement on Economic Measures for the Railways which was signed in
July 1977. Its main provision was that governmental compensation payments
were to provide railways with necessary liquidity (para. 5.02). Also, a
federal law on Yugoslavia's pricing policy was being prepared. To ensure
that the next tariff increases were not delayed pending its promulgation the
mission recommended that a suitable tariff increase should be condition of
Boatd presentation.
2.07     During 1977, the Railway Transporr Enterprise (RTE) Belgrade was
reorganized  into  four  Railway  Transport  nrganizations  (RTOs),  namely



Belgrade (Serbia), Novi Sad (Vojvodina), Titograd (Montenegro) and Pristina
(Kosovo).   As  appraisal  documentation  had  been  prepared  for  the  RTE
Belgrade, the mission proposed that for the purpose of the Loan and
Subsidiary Agreements the four RTOs should jointly assume the responsibili-
ties which would have been assumed by RTE Belgrade, and that separate docu-
mentation  should  be  prepared by each RTO by a date  .o be agreed at
negotiations   The mission also suggested that CYR should have a special
responsibility for ensuring that the RTOs' financial and operational targets
should aggregate to those set for RTE Belgrade.  The suggestions were con-
sidered acceptable by the Yugoslav representatives.
Negotiations
2.08     At negotiations,  the Federal Government requested an increase in
the proposed loan amount from US$100 million to US$112 million.  This re-
quest stemmed from the desire of all the Republics and Provinces to allocate
a larger proportion of the Bank loan to RTO Pristina.  The delegation also
requested that the Bank consider making a subsequent separate loan to RTO
Pristina prior to the next planned loan for railways. The Bank advised the
Yugoslav delegation that an increase was not possible in view of the already
significant total lending to Yugoslavia during the current fiscal year.
While it was premature to decide on whether there should be a special loan
for RTO Pristina or whether it should be allocated priority share within the
next overall railway operation, it was agreed that on the basis of feasi-
bility studies the Yugoslav authorities concerned would propose specific
projects for further financing.
2.09     Negotiations lasted sixteen days and were concluded successfully on
January 20, 1978.  The loan was approved by the  Board of Directors  on
March 23, 1978 and the Loan Agreement, which was supported by four subsid-
iary agreements, :xne each between CYR and three RTOs (Ljubljana, Zagreb and
Sarajevo) and one for four RTOs combined (RTOs Belgrade, Novi Sad, Pristina
and Titograd), was signed on April 13, 1978. Due to delay in obtaining the
necessary legal decisions from Republican and Federal Governments, the loan
became effective on September 28, 1978.
Project Description
2.10     The project consisted of the 1978-80 slice of the Invfestment Plan
1976-80 and comprised the following principal components:
Components of the Fourth Railway Project (Loan 1026-YU)
-   completion of the 1964 Modernization Program, including remain-
ing program sections of electrification (15 km), signalling and
telecommunications (29 stations), and marshalling yards;
-   remaining related investments, necessary to realize the full
benefits of .he 1964 Modernization Program, consisting of track
overhaul (38 Em), signalling (3 stations), and modernization of
marshalling yards at Zagreb and Sarajevo Junction.



-6-
Components financed by the Bank under the new loan
-   track overhaul (974 km) and reconstruction of line (52 km); and
- electrification (about 200 km of lines).
Components financed from other sources
-   other investments in fixed installations, including electrifi-
cation (257 km), signalling and telecommunications (137 km of
lines), track overhaul (476 km), reconstruction of lines and
construction of new lines, and reconstruction and construction
of main stations;
-   the purchase of 54 electric locomotives, 60 diesel locomotives,
3 diesel shunters, 53 electric and 45 diesel multiple units,
152 passenger coaches and 2508 freight wagons; and
-   other investments for integrated transport, workshops and de-
pots and for data processing.
2.11     The Bank loan also financed technical assistance and staff training
to assist CYR and the RTOs, notably in preparing technical/economic studies
for reviewing the Investment Plans and preparing successive five-year plans,
and for carrying out a study of maintenance practices for electric
locomotives.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COSTS
Start-up
3.01     There were no serious start-up difficulties.  However, progress in
procurement of track-materials was at first slow, mainly due to difficulties
in evaluation of bids (para. 3.10).
Revisions
3.02     Project.  In November 1979, a request accompanied by a revised fea-
sibility study was received from CYR for the transfer of the electrification
on the line Skopje - Gevgelija (163 km, cost estimate about US$21 million)
from Part B to Part A of the Investment Plan for RTO Skopje. The feasibil-
ity study, which was based on improved traffic forecast, was found to be
satisfactory and by telex of July 3, 1980, the Bank agreed to the transfer
of the electrification into Part A of the Investment Plan. However, this
item which would complete the electrification of the main line to Greece,
was started only in 1982 and is now being completed under the Sixth Railway
Project (para. 7.03).
3.03     Bank Financed Items.  In February 1979, CYR requested that a bal-
ance of about US$7 million, resulting from the conclusion of all intended
contracts for steel track materials under favourable terms, should be used
for the purchase of additional steel track materials (about 11,700t of
rails, fastenings and 1,400 welding portions). The Bank accepted this pro-
posal in a telex of May 24, 1979 with the condition, that the new rails and
fastenings would be used only on track renewal of main lines within the
project. In addition, in a letter of May 15, 1981, the Bank agreed that the
uncommitted balance of the loan could be used for the purchase of track
maintenance equipment (about US$7.9 million). Because of unexpectedly low
prices, further purchases of maintenance equipment were made totalling about
US$1.3 million.
Implementation Schedule
3.04     General.  Physical progress on the project as a whole can be judged
as satisfactory, despite the fact, that certain project items not financed
by the Bank were completed two to three years behind schedule (Table 1).
The delay was mainly due to lack of local funding caused by increasing dif-
ficulties of the Yugoslav economy.
3.05     Bank Financed Items.  For the project as a whole, 641 of track
overhaul and only 392 of electrification were completed by the original tar-
get date. However, there were substantial differences between the RTOs:
while RTO Belgrade had finished its work on time, RTO Pristina had completed
less than 60 km out of 94 km. By the end of 1981, 83% of all track overhaul
and the electrification on the line Doboj-Bosanski Novi - with the exception
of 12 km of two branch lines - were completed. About 90% of the Bank fi-
nanced items were completed by the original closing date, June 30, 1982.
All works, except the branch line electrification and a 16 km line section
for reconstruction in the area of Pancevo, were finished by mid-1983.



- 9 -
3.06     The major reasons for delays in implementation were higher than
expected inflation and increasing difficulties in providing local funding.
The electrification of the two branch lines leading to mines near Doboj and
Bosanski Novi could not be carried out because contributions to be provided
by benefitting mines and companies were not made available.  Another example
of difficulties which had to be faced was a five years long dispute between
the RTO Novi Sad and the city of Pancevo.  It was planned to renew the track
of the line Belgrade - Vrsac in the area of the city on the existing route.
An urban development plan contained a rerouting of the line. At the begin-
ning of 1984, the city finally agreed that the track overhaul could be done
on the existing route.
3.07     Other Pr'iect Items.  Results in implementation of other items were
less satisfactory (Table 1).  Infrastructure investments were seriously de-
layed while purchases of passenger coaches and freight wagons were executed
as planned.   Increased  costs of materials  required additional  financing
which, as a rule, resulted in delay of implementation. Also, cost estimates
especially for traction and rolling made by some RTOs were too low and
resulted in cost overruns.   In general,  implementation of the Investment
Plan was made more difficult due to the slowdown in economic growth from
1980 and the effect on the financial performance of the RTOs.
3.08     Time  Schedule.   In summary,  the original time schedule was not
unrealistic.   At appraisal,  the  closing  date was estimated at June 30,
1982. In view of the delivery schedule for track maintenance machines (para
3.14), CYR request by telex of April 30, 1982 an extension of the closing
date to June 30, 1983, which was granted by Bank telex of May 21, 1982. By
telex of November 11, 1983, the Bank agreed to a further postponement of the
closing date to May 31, 1984 to allow for the financing of a consultancy
contract for the preparation of project completion reports for the Fourth
and the Fifth Railway Projects (para. 3.24).
3.09     Reporting.   Initial reporting was rather poor in quality and un-
timely but this improved gradually during project implementation. Quarterly
progress reports were received from CYR containing separate physical and fi-
nancial progress schedules for investments at each of the RTOs. These were
subject of discussion and examination by regular Bank missions, which
visited each of the RTOs accompanied by representatives of CYR. The role of
CYR as a coordination agency for Bank railway projects in Yugoslavia was
very useful and was strengthened. This development helped greatly to expe-
dite preparation of the Sixth Railway Project which followed.
Procurement
3.10     Steel  Track Materials.   Bidding documents for ICB were prepared
immediately after negotiations and bids were opened on July 6, 1978.
Proposals for award caused considerable disagreement by the Bank. There was
a clear tendency in the Borrowers original recommendations toward favouring
domestic bidders resulting in rejection of some foreign bidders on grounds
of minor deviations, delivery requirements and technical arguments. Award
of contracts for the disputed items was finally agreed in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines in December 1978. A further delay due to formalities



- 10 -
required for imports and in establishing of Letters of Credit resulted in a
revision of the delivery schedule for track materials from foreign
suppliers.  In a telex of July 20, 1979 the Bank expressed its concern that
Letters of Credit were still not issued for contracts which were signed in
1978. A letter from CYR dated June 9, 1980, shown in Annex 1, summarized
the difficulties with procurement in early 1979 and demonstrates the effects
on implementation.
3.11     Equipment for Modernization of the Line Doboj-Bosanski Novi.  The
hidding documents for electrification, signalling and telecommunications
equipment to be procured under ICB were accepted by the Bank in September
1978.  Bids were opened on November 28 of the same year.  Bank's agreement
to award of contract to a Yugoslav firm was given in a telex of February 8,
1979. There were no difficulties concerning this procurement.
3.12     Track Maintenance Equipment.  In April 1981, CYR requested to use
the uncommitted balance of the loan for the purchase of track maintenance
equipment, to which the Bank agreed in May 1981 (para. 3.03). Queries con-
cerning the justification, the number of equipment and especially the tech-
nical conditions of the bidding documents for ICB resulted in the publica-
tion of the bid as late as October 1981. Bid opening was on December 16,
1981. The bid evaluation report was received by the Bank on February 8,
1982. The Borrower's initial proposals for award tended to favour bids from
suppliers, from whom the RTOs already had similar machines, although they
were not the lowest bidders.
3.13     In a letter of January 29, 1982, CYR had requested procurement of
additional track maintenance equipment, because the prices' offered in the
first  bid  were  very  favourable  and  considerably  below  estimates.   In
April 1982, the Bank agreed to this request and suggested that all bidders
who participated in the previous ICB to submit new bid prices on L'e basis
of the existing bidding documents.  Given the fact that the loan closing
date was June 30, 1982, invitations were made by telex and a bidding period
of only three weeks was permitted, so that all procurement formalities could
be completed before the closing date. A second bid evaluation report for
the additional equipment was mailed by CYR on May 28, 1982.
3.14     The Bank agreed to some awards in April, while for most of the
items from both bids final agreements were given in June 1982. The delivery
schedule for the track maintenance machines reached into the first half of
1983, thus causing an extension of the closing date (para. 3.08).
Technical Assistance
3.15     Electric Locomotive Maintenance Study.  The Loan Agreement provided
that CYR and the RTOs should undertake a study to be financed from loan
funds establishing conditions for Achievement of Operating Target of
Yugoslav Railways in Relation to Availability and Efficiency of Single Phase
Electric Locomotives Series 441 and 461.  The Terms of Reference were ac-
cepted by the Bank in February 1979. The process of inviting proposals from
consultants and preparing a recommendation for award lasted for one year.
In March 1980, the Bank agreed to CYR beginning negotiations with a German
firm, which resulted in signing of a contract on April 1, 1981. A Yugoslav
consultancy firm was sub-contracted.



- 11 -
3.16     Works on the study began on June 1, 1981, but difficulties in ob-
taining data from some RTOs and denial of access to sites in several cases
due to a certain resistance against such an indepth review, led to an inter-
ruption on July 10, 1981, for about a year-and-a-half. An annex to the con-
tract was signed on December 22, 1982 settling the request for adjusted fees
due to the interruption and agreeing on a new time schedule. Works on the
study continued in January 1983, an Interim Report was delivered in June and
the Final Report in December 1983.
3.17     The report, which proposes a major rationalization of maintenance
facilities and which will entail considerable changes in the present work-
load and jobs between the RTOs, has been well received, both by the RTOs and
by government authorities.   Implementation of the recommendations is being
done on a gradual basis.
3.18     Rail  Cost Study.   The  study,  which  formed  part  of  the  Eighth
Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU), was completed in 1979, but, during the im-
plementation period of the Fifth Railway Project, the Bank had to press the
RTOs in order to reach a concensus on this complex and critical matter.
Agreement was reached in 1982 and the cost accounting system was tested in
1984 over a period of five months. Further extensive testing and review is
in progress.
3.19     The principal cause of delay in reaching the consensus and in im-
plementing the new costing system is the fact that it will result in changes
in allocation of revenues between the RTOs.  In addition, because each RTO
consists of a number of separate Basic Organization of Associated Labour
(BOALs), the new system will result in changes in the revenue share of BOALs
within each RTO and consequently individual earnings.
3.20     Signalling Study on other than Main Lines.  In 1977, CYR made a
decision concerning the need to establish common standards for all RTOs for
signalling on various types of secondary lines and in different traffic den-
sities. One reason for its inception was that signalling of main lines was
approaching completion, and demand seemed likely to fall below the produc-
tion capacity of Yugoslav signalling manufacturers, there being relatively
little prospect for exports.  A contract was given to a Yugoslav institute
for a survey of the existing state of signalling on all secondary lines of
Yugoslav Railways and for proposals to ensure balanced future signalling
development.
3.21     The  first  stage of  this  study was  carried  out  without  Bank's
assistance.  In February 1979, the Bank suggested that all technical solu-
tions should also be subject to economic analysis, in order to ascertain
their viability and to ensure that the most cost effective solutions are
adopted. Draft Terms of Reference for the economic analysis were prepared
in June 1979 and were finally agreed upon by the Bank in March 1980. An
annex to the contract with the institute to be financed from loan funds was
accepted by the Bank in a telex of May 6, 1981.  The delay in finalizing the
annex to the contract appears to have been due to: (i) reaching an agreement
between CYR and the RTOs about the necessity of an economic analysis; (ii)
selection of suitable lines accord ng to CYR criteria as models for an eval-
uation, and (iii) negotiation with the institute about modifications on the



- 12 -
earlier completed technical part in order to establish consistency with the
new Terms of Reference for the economic analysis.
3.22     Works on the study began in the latter half of 1981, but the first
summary report was submitted with over a two year delay in February 1984.
This delay was due to (i) proposals by CYR and the RTOs to improve the
quality of the study so that it could serve as a handbook for the prepara-
tion of feasibility studies; and (ii) difficulties in obtaining authoriza-
tion from the Yugoslav authorities to deliver the report to the Bank.
3.23     The outcome of the study was rather mixed as compared to the Bank's
expectations.   Instead of focussing on the definition of simplified solu-
tions of signalling equipment based on economic justification, the study
concentratcd more on domestically developed systems already proposed for ap-
plication on secondary lines.  The institute has prepared an annex to the
study with an evaluation of the economic viability of different combinations
of signalling modules for one line. Despite the above mentioned deficien-
cies, the conclusions provide clear recommendations for signalling solutions
based on different levels of traffic and safety requirements.
3.24     Project Completion Report.  Considering that the task of collecting
and preparing data from eight RTOs for a completion report was well beyond
the workload capacity of CYR, the Bank suggested in September 1983 that CYR
hire consultants not only to assist in carrying out this task for the Fifth
Railway Project,  but also for the overdue report on the Fourth Railway
Project.  By telex of November 11, 1983, the Bank agreed to postpone the
closing date to May 31, 1984 tc allow for the financing of a consultancy
contract for the preparation of the completion reports (para. 3.08).
3.25     Despite the short time available for this large task, the reports
were delivered on time and provided a good basis for the Bank's Project
Completion Reports on both the Fourth and the Fifth Railway Projects.
Evaluation of events and developments during the project periods was well
documented and the performance of the consultants was satisfactory.

The total cost overrun on the project in Dinar terms was 41S, due to the
much higher than expected inflation rates beginning in 1980/81. However, as
the Dinar began depreciating against the US Dollar during the same period
roughly in line with local inflation, the cost overrun measured in US Dollar
terms was only 15X. The cost overrun came primarily from spillover items
from the period of the Fourth Railway Project, and from rolling stock
purchases, where in total the RTOs bought substantially more freight wagons
than planned (Table 1) and unit prices had been underestimated, especially
for locomotives.
3.27     Disbursements.  Due to the delay in procurement on track materials
(para. 3.10) disbursement lagged wel' behind the forecast during the initial
period.  However, at the end of the three-year project period, 88% of the
loan was disbursed. Due to financing of new items (para. 3.03), the balance
was disbursed over a further period of three years. Planned and actual dis-
bursements by years are shown below:

IV. TRAFFIC AND OPERATIONS
Traffic
4.01     At appraisal, railway freight traffic was forecast to reach 26.0
billion ton-km and passenger traffic 11.1 billion passenger-km by 1980. The
corresponding forecast annual increases during 1976-80 were 5.51 for freight
and 2.82 for passengers.  Freight traffic increased faster than estimated
until 1979, reaching in'that year the target for 1980, but then declined in
1980, and increased again to 26.2 billion ton-km in 1982. The increase be-
tween 1976 and 1980 was 232 or 4.51 per year. Passenger traffic showed a
slight, but steady increase of about 1.22 per year, beginning to fall short
of the forecasts in 1979 and reaching only 10.4 billion passenger-km in 1980
and 11.3 billion passenger km in 1982 (about the level forecast for 1980)
(Tables 3 and 4). The main reason for the shortfall of freight traffic in
1980 were foreign exchange difficulties facing Yugoslavia, which led to im-
port restrictions of petroleum.  Since 1980, freight traffic has increased
at about 3.51 p.a. and passenger traffic at about 2.51 p.a.  During this
period, the railways have increased slightly their share of total traffic,
partly as a result of fuel shortages and rationing which affected road
transport.
Operations
4.02     Selected operating statistics for 1976-1981 are given in Table 3.
Operating efficiency targets were set in the appraisal report or included in
the Loan Agreement.  In general, operating efficiency improved satisfacto-
rily up to 1979, but worsened after that year considerably for reasons men-
tioned above (para. 4.01).
4.03     Total length of the railway network in Yugoslavia decreased from
9,967 km in 1976 to 9,393 km in 1981; i.e. by 574 km. This was the result
of closing uneconomic lines, of which 348 km were of narrow gauge.
4.04     Disappointing results were achieved in availability of diesel and
electric locomotives.   The country's difficult foreign exchange position,
which became apparent in 1980, was undoubtedly a serious problem in recent
years, and limited the availability of spare parte. However, the shortage
of foreign exchange was not the only constraint. For instance, the recom-
mendations   made   in   the   Electric   Locomotive   Maintenance   Study
(paras. 3.15-3.17) demonstrated serious weaknesses in the organization of
locomotive maintenance.
4.05     Other operating key indicators improved slightly during the period
1976-1981, but with substantial variations during the period. Train-km of
passenger trains increased 4.51 despite a substantial decrease in passenger
transport. Train-km of freight trains increased 13.7%, but much slower than
net-ton-km  (+22.9S),  which  shows  an  increased  efficiency  in  freight
transport. Freight wagon turnaround time varied strongly showing a slight
improvement is 1981 compared to 1976.  The average speed of freight trains
improved marginally.

4.06     Productivity, measured in traffic units1' per employee showed the
best results, improving constantly from 265.0 in 1976 to 348.5 in 1981 or by
31.52, due to substantial reducdions in staff and the increase in net-ton-km
and passenger-km.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Tariffs and Compensation Payments
5.01     Although the Fourth Yugoslav Railway Project had been generally
successful in achieving its objectives, it was not successful in its aim of
making the railways financially viable through tariff revenues.  To achieve
this end, the Government had concluded a Social Agreement on freight pricing
in 1974 by which they agreed to take all actions necessary to maintain
tariffs at levels sufficient to cover costs and to provide adequate funds
for investments. In the event however that the Government, fighting severe
inflationary pressures following the oil crisis of 1973"', held tariff in-
creases below the rate of inflation. The inevitable result of these inade-
quate tariff increases was that revenues were insufficient for the railway's
needs and, since subsidies were paid in arrears, the railways had to resort
to short-term borrowing to meet their most pressing liquidity needs.
5.02     Realizing that no railway can function efficiently with deficits
financed in arrears, but convinced that under prevailing circumstances the
answer was not to be found by tariff increases, the Federal Government, in
1976, established a commission comprising representatives of Federal,
Republican and Provincial Governments, the Chamber of Economy and CYR to
look for alternative solutions.   The result was the Social Agreement on
Economic and Other Measures to Provide Normal Economic Conditions for the
Railways (SAE), which was signed by the Federal, Republican and Provincial
Governments in July 1977 and whose main objective was to provide a sound
financial and economic situation for the railways, including a solution to
the liquidity problem, while still maintaining financial discipline.  The
SAE provided inter alia for revenues of thaw railways, in 1977/1978 and sub-
sequent years,  to be supplemented by regular compensation payments,  the
amount of which would be determined one year in advance and which would vary
with traffic volume and quality of service. The SAE provided also that the
Governments' obligations regarding the compensation payments should be taken
over by Communities of Interest (COI), comprising representatives of the
railways and its users. These communities also assumed much of Governments'
responsibilities for oversight of the railways.
5.03     The Bank accepted the system of the railways being compensated for
past tariff increases through a traffic-related contribution from the
Communities of Interest (the users of the railway), but made the provision
that, by 1980, all ad hoc payments (general subsidies) must be replaced by
traffic  related  contributions   (the  compensation  payments)  from  the
Communities of Interest and that the propoicion of these non-tariff revenues
t.o total revenues should reduce by a third from the 221 level of 1976 to no
more than 152 by 1980.  The enactment of a tariff increase in 1978, suffi-
cient to cover inflation in 1977 was made a condition of Board presentation
of the loan documents.
l/ From 1972 through 1978, the dollar cost of oil imports to Yugoslavia rose
ten-fold.



- 18 -
5.04     The switch during 1977/78 from subsidies paid in arrears to compen-
sation payments made monthly was accepted by the Bank in that it introduced
some financial discipline and efficiency stimulating affects. In effect, in
return for the compensation payments for the users, the railways are expect-
ed to meet agreed productivity and  service  standards.   The  system  also
brought much needed relief to the railways' liquidity position.  However,
the payements are based only on enterprise incomes and are not related to
the costs of moving traffic on specific lines.
5.05     During  1977-79,  inflation  in  Yugosldvia  (as  measured  by  the
Industrial Producer Price Index) continued at a relatively moderate rate and
to which tariff increases were reasonably related. However, since the rate
of inflation was increasing and tariff increases after 1976 were mainly made
later in the year rather than on January 1, they did not enable tariff
revenues to keep pace with costs. This was particularly so after the esca-
lation of oil prices in 1979 which had a serious effect on the Yugoslav
economy. The table below shows December to December inflation as measured
by the Industrial Producer Price Index in Yugoslavia compared to railway
tariff increases and shows the efforts which were made to match increasing
inflation with tariffs.

5.07     The first forecast column shown above reflects the expectation that
with the aid of the compensation payments, the railways would achieve
healthy operating ratios improving slightly from 95 in 1977 to 93 in 1980.
The second forecast column shows the expectation that increasing tariff
revenues would reduce operating ratios calculated without compensation pay-
ments from 123 in 1977 to 110 in 1980. The first "actual" column show6 the
benefit the railways received from the advent of the compensation system.
The operating ratio of 108 in 1976 was reduced to 94 in 1978 and although it
did not achieve the expectations at appraisal and rose to 98 in 1982, it
remained at healthy levels and operating revenues exceeded operating
expenditures in every year from 1978 onwards. However, in comparison to
this bright picture, the second "actual" column illustrates the increasing
reliance of the railways upon the compensation payments as tariff increases
proved inadequate to match rising costs, even though the railways' operating
performance improved and operating unit costs reduced by 10% in real terms
from 1976 to 1983.'

5.09     As can be seen above, surpluses were achieved in 1978 and 1979 but
thereafter rising interest charges changed positive net revenues into defi-
cits  which,  in years apart  from 1982,  have been  small.   However,  the
Yugoslav policy of realistic depreciation rates and regular revaluation of
assets results in an adequate depreciation provision which has still ensured
a reasonable internal funds generation.
Financial Covenants
5.10     The principal financial covenant In the Loan Agreement required CYR
and the RTOs to take all actions within their powers to implement the mea-
sures specified in the SAE, including the adjustment of freight and passen-
ger tariffs, to provide revenues as specified in the Subsidiary Agreements
and to use their best efforts to achieve the specified annual financial tar-
gets.  The relevant sections of the Subsidiary Agreements specified that
revenues should be sufficient each year to cover operating expenses, debt
service, increases in working capital and to finance a specified proportion
of each RTO's investments. The Subsidiary Agreements also specified a mini-
mum proportion of total revenues which, commencing with the year 1980,
should be obtained through tariff revenues. The proportions varied between
RTOs but together totalled 85Z of all railway revenues with the intention
that by 1980, compensation payment would be no more than 152 of total reve-
nues.  The targets contained in the Loan Agreement for the railways as a
whole, together with actual achievements, are shown below:

5.11     As discussed above, with the help of the compensation payments,
operating ratios were very close to target and a return on net fixed assets
was made each year, although smaller than  the  targets.   The  increased
liquidity that came with the compensation payments from the Communities of
Interest is shown by the Cash and Other Working Capital Fxpenses ratios.
All these indicators show the railways as being in good financial
condition. The principal financial target which was not achieved however,
as shown below, was the required increase in the proportion of tariff reve-
nues to 852 of total revenues by 1980.

The reasons for this failure have been discussed in the section on tariffs
above.  The reduction of the railways' reliance on non-tariff revenue was a
main objective of the project and was not achieved.
Financing Investments
5.12     A statement showing the railway cash flow by years from 1976 to
1982 is shown at Table 6.  The project was defined as the three year,
1978-80, time slice of the railways' 1976-80 Investment Plans.  However, the
loan became effective only at the end of September 1978 and for reasons dis-
cussed in Section 3 of this report, work on the project was substantially
completed only by the mid-1983. Since other planned investments for 1981
and 1982 were carried out during this period it is possible to show here
only the financing of total investments including these additional invest-
ments. Financing for the years 1978-80 is shown below at Table A and com-
pared to the appraisal forecast, while financing of investments for the
years 1979 to 1982, the period during which the bulk of the project was in
fact implemented, is shown at Table B.

5.13        The better comparison is between the appraisal forecast and ac-
tual figures shown at Table B. It is notable that even with the help of the
compensation payment, the percentage of investments financed from internal
resources (231) fell short of the 31% forecast at appraisal. Internal funds
generation was good but both debt service (due to the depreciation of the
Dinar) and working capital took a bigger share than forecast at appraisal.
Performance in financing investments varied very much between the RTOs with
RTO Sarajevo at the head of the list having financed 41% of investment dur-
ing the four year period from own funds. Finance from grants was more than
forecast with RTO Ljubljana, with infrastructure investments in junction
reconstruction, as the principal recipient.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     Management  of the railways in Yugoslavia was always  technically
competent in traditional railway skills and disciplines and, besides the
difficulties in carrying out some works under traffic in confined space,
most problems which arose in carrying out the project were mainly due to ex-
ternal  circumstances.   However,  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  and
Investment Plans including Operation Plans suffered initially from a short-
age of experienced staff at the railways. A substantial portion of feasi-
bility studies for major items was prepared by foreign consultants.  As a
result the close association of railway planning staff with the consultants
during the long period of project preparation was of particular benefit.
Many of the feasibility studies for the Sixth Railway Project were prepared
by RTO's own staff who had worked with Bank staff and consultants in previ-
ous years. Similarly, the preparation of Operational, Financial and Action
Plans, and their integration, greatly supported the development effort and
the performance of the railways.
6.02     Under the Fourth Railway Project, CYR had set up a panel of quali-
fied experta to assist in the preparation of bidding documents, bid evalu-
ation and in coordinating procurement.  This panel functioned well and en-
sured an orderly and efficient procurement process; it took responsibility
for reviewing the requirements for ICB and also acted as coordinating agency
between the RTOs and the Bank for all procurement under ICB. All bid evalu-
ations for Bank financed items were made by RTOs with the assistance of a
member of the CYR panel. This panel has continued its work under the Fifth
and Sixth Railway Project.
6.03     Although some targets of the Action Plans were not achieved during
the project period (paras. 4.02-4.06), the use of these plans by the RTOs as
a managerial tool was equally beneficial, especially for reaching a common
understanding by all concerned on objectives and responsibilities as well as
on the measures to be taken to improve performance and the time required for
their achievement. The plans addressed themselves to improvements in orga-
nization, planning, marketing, productivity and training as well as measures
for operational efficiency; targets and times were formulated by the RTOs
themselves. Annual reports about the achievements were the basis for revi-
sions of the Action Plans, their targets and the ways and means on how to
achieve them. Associated with the Action Plans were the Operational Plans
which provided a methodology for the assessment of future requirements of
traction and rolling stock.  Annual updates on the basis of actual traffic
and operational figures provided justification to revise the agreed purchas-
ing program.  Both Action Plans and Operational Plans continue to be used
successfully by the RTOs.
6.04     Foreign and local consultants played an important role during the
project preparation and execution period.  Despite difficulties with some
RTOs (para. 3.16), foreign consultants not only contributed to the prepara-
tion of feasibility studies but also increased the capability of Yugoslav
consultancy firms and RTO staff to such an extent that all studies for the
Sixth Railway Project were prepared satisfactorily without foreign help. A
major impact on the railways' future development with regard to locomotive
maintenance is expected as a result of the Electric Locomotive Maintenance



- 24 -
Study carried out by German consultants together with a sub-contracted
Yugoslav consultancy firm. The recommendations, which will entail consider-
able changes in the organization of maintenance and will result in a major
rationalization of maintenance facilities, have been well received, both by
the RTOs and by Government authorities (para. 3.17). A Rail Cost Study,
prepared by Yugoslav consultants, has required substantial efforts on the
part of the Bank in order to reach a consensus by all RTOs on this complex
and critical matter, because it will result in changes in the revenue share
of the BOALs within each RTO and consequently individual earnings. Further
extensive testing will be required before general acceptance (paras. 3.18
and 3.19). The outcome of the Signalling Study on other than Main Lines was
rather mixed as compared to the Bank's expectations (para. 3.23). The hand-
ling of this study by CYR and the RTO demonstrates best the difficulties and
time required in the given organizational structure of Yugoslav railways.
Bank's assistance certainly has contributed to its final conclusion but not
removed the institutional difficulties in reaching mutual agreement (para.
3.21).   The Project  Completion Report  for the Fourth and Fifth Railway
Projects required extensive assistance from consultants because the scope of
task in collecting and preparing data from eight RTOs was well beyond the
capacity of CYR staff. The performance of the consultants was satisfactory
and formed a basis for future work of this kind by CYR (paras. 3.24 and
3.25).

VII. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
7.01     The main benefits of the project were felt in the improved opera-
tional efficiency of the railways and their ability to compete in an in-
creasingly competitive transport market.   The project  provided  continued
support for modernization of the railways during the 1976-80 Development
Plan. During this periods freight traffic growth jumped from about 21 per
year to over 42 per year while passenger traffic showed modest increases of
1 to 22 per year in contrast to the earlier stagnation or even decline in
total traffic (para. 4.01). As a major component of the project, accounting
for about 352 of Part A of the Investment Plans, track overhaul of over
1,400 km of main lines enabled the railways to avoid stepped-up track main-
tenance costs, which would otherwise have been necessary,  reduced derail-
ments and attendant losses, and to reduce equipment and rolling stock
requirements through higher operating speeds.  Investments in traction and
rolling stock represented the single largest item in the program with just
under 40% of the total, with the bulk of this component covering equipment
renewal.   If equipment had not been replaced in time under the project,
either the ensuing bottlenecks in the railway system would have disrupted
economic activity and much of the traffic would have to have been moved at
higher cost by road, or the traffic would have been carried at a consider-
able increase in operating and maintenance costs. This trend was already in
evidence during the early 1970s and, together with the previous Fourth
Railway Project, the project helped stop the transfer of traffic to road
transport during the latter part of the decade.  Modernization in the form
of electrification (about 300 km) and improved signalling and telecommunica-
tions represented about 10% of the investment program. These investments on
high density lines provide direct operating cost savings through higher
operating speeds as well as savings in system operating costs.
7.02     At appraisal, the railways made a comprehensive cost/benefit analy-
sis of the investment plan as a whole which siaowed an ER of about 151. ERs
for individual parts of the plan were about 25% for traction and rolling
stock, 17X for track overhaul and about 15% for electrification and signal-
ling components.
7.03     An economic re-evaluation was conducted for a number of track over-
haul and electrification components of the plan as well as for the traction
and rolling stock items. Actual project costs and estimated benefits were
adjusted to 1983 prices and the updated benefit streams have been estimated
based on trends in actual traffic. Traffic is assumed to increase at about
3% per year overall (Table 8). However, on the Bosanski-Doboj Novi line in
RTO Sarajevo, a 101 annual growth rate is assumed between 1980 and 1985 to
reflect substantial additional traffic from a new iron ore mine at Omarska
(Table 10).  The ERs were re-estimated for eight different track overhaul
items providing a range of ERs from 15% to 301, with an overall average of
201. An example of the calculation for the Osijek-Koprivnica section is
shown in Table 9. Although track overhaul costs have increased over apprai-
sal estimates, the ERs are comparable to the appraisal estimates because of
previously conservative assumptions on maintenance savings. The renewal of
traction and rolling stock assumes that without replacement, the additional
traffic would have to be handled by road transport. The equipment renewal
program is based on detailed operational plans, providing a typical ER of



- 26 -
about 252. During the period 1979-84, there were three main line electrifi-
cation projects. The two major electrifications, which were among the Bank-
financed items, have been re-evaluated, namely the Bosanski Novi-Doboj line
in RTO Sarajevo and the Indjija-Subotica line in RTO Novi Sad which show ERs
of 15% and 162 respectively. Details of the re-evaluation of the Bosanski
Novi-Doboj project) which represents completion of electrification on the
main route between Zagreb and Sarajevo, are shown in Table 10. The third
project, which began in 1982 and is now being completed, is the electrifica-
tion of the main line between Skopje and Gevgelija (Greek border). Traffic
in RTO Skopje grew 3.82 p.a. from 1977 to 1984, slightly less than forecast
at appraisal. Although figures are not available, traffic on the Skopje-
Gevgelija section is likely to have grown in a similar way. Thus the eco-
nomic return is expected to be similar to the (post)appraisal estimate, and
in addition, the line has important indirect effects associated with the
completion of electrification of the main Yugoslav trunk line and the con-
nection with the Greek network. Taking account of the investments evaluated
above, the ER for the investment program as a whole is estimated at about
182, a figure which is above the appraisal estimate of 152.

VIII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01     The project continued and expanded the cooperative dialogue between
the Federal, Republican and Provincial authorities and strengthened coordi-
nation within the railways.  The Bank had a major impact in establishing
well-balanced Investment Plans based on realistic traffic forecasts.
8.02     The project emphasized investments  in maintaining  the  railways'
operational capability through extensive track overhaul and through purchase
of traction and rolling stock as well as in increased capacity through
equipping lines with modern signalling and telecommunications as well as
electrification projects on high density main lines.   In retrospect,  the
content of the project was appropriate. The implementation schedule suffer-
ed delays mainly due to lack of local funding caused by increasing diffi-
culties of the Yugoslav economy. When most of the program was completed in
1981, it enabled the railways to continue to play a major role in the trans-
port market at a time of increasing emphasis on bulk traffic movements as
well as restrictions on road transport operations because of fuel shortages.
8.03     The frequency of Bank supervision was adequate and the quality of
its work appears to have been good.
8.04     As in many other railway projects the Bank's expectations on the
financial performance were too optimistic. The main cause of this has been
the Government's reluctance to raise railway tariffs to compensate for ris-
ing costs at a time of rapid local inflation. As a result, the reduction of
the railways reliance on non-tariff revenue, which was an important objec-
tive of the project, has not been achieved. However, the Bank pursued its
efforts and convinced the Yugoslav authorities of t e necessity of substan-
tial tariff increases and compensation reductions under the Sixth Railway
Project.

IX.  CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The composition of the project was appropriate and well balanced.
The final completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and the remaining
related investments from the Fourth Railway Project were necessary to enable
the railways to efficiently fulfill their role of principal carrier of bulk
materials, over long and medium hauls. Also, of the Bank financed items,
track overhaul of about 1000 km was vital for the railways to maintain ade-
quate standards of operation and the electrification of about 200 km helped
to increase efficiency.  The same can be said about the other components
which were financed from other sources, such as investments in fixed instal-
lations and the purchase of traction and rolling stock.
9.02     Despite the fact that during appraisal t%  Investment Plans were
reduced by about a third, it was necessary to divide the plans into two
parts; Part A cox.sisting of investments which were to proceed as scheduled,
and Part B, whose execution would depend on adequate financial and physical
resources and on additional evidence of economic viability. As it turned
out, hardly any investment under Part B was realized, mainly due to lack of
local funding; it shows clearly that the railways overestimated their abil-
ity to finance and implement a larger investment program.
9.03     Project preparation was based on experience  with previous Bank
loans and was therefore thorough and extensive, covering all aspects of
railway activities. Project design was well conceived in that it concen-
trated on modernization of railway facilities in order to improve efficiency
and the competitive position of the railways. As the project was conceived
as a sector-type operation, it was possible to make revisions to the proj-
ect's Bank-financed items following the rapid depreciation of the Dinar
against the US Dollar.  Uncomwitted balances were used to finance other
items within the scope of the project.
9.04     Procurement under ICB appears to be an area where railway staff
were not totally familiar with the Bank's guidelines. The clear tendency in
the Borrower's original recommendations to favour domestic bidders resulted
in delay at the beginning of implementation which could have been avoided.
A lesson to be learned should be to perhaps arrange procurement seminars and
also to allow for a more realistic period for procurement in the implementa-
tion schedule taking into account the quite substantial time needed to
establish Letters of Credit.
9.05     Technical assistance by foreign consultants twice encountered dif-
ficulties in obtaining data from some RTOs. In one case, due to a certain
resistance  against  an  in-depth  review,  access  to  sites  was  denied
(para. 3.16). However, as the capability of Yugoslav consultancy firms has
increased over the years, there is now a tendency to employ local firms
rather than foreign ones and these sensitive problems have been avoided.
But, it must be pointed out that some participation of foreign consultants
remains necessary to ensure that Yugoslav railways continue to have access
to the best and most suitable technology.



- 29 -
9.06     The financial covenants, which were designed to eliminate all gen-
eral subsidies, to reduce compensation payments and to increase the rail-
ways'  financial  viability  through  tariff  revenues,  were  appropriate.
However, the authorities' commitment to adequate tariff increases weakened
in the face of a rising inflation rates partly as a result of the escalation
of oil prices in 1979.  The reduction of the railway's reliance on non-
tariff revenue was not achieved and in this respect the project failed to
reach an important objective.   As a result, financial covenants for the
Sixth Railway Project have been made more specific, while adequate tariff
increases were made a condition in the Loan Agreement.
9.07     Traffic forecasts for freight traffic were achieved but to a lesser
extent for passenger traffic, where actual results fell short of the fore-
casts for several years and only approached the target in 1981. Operational
efficiency had been improving very satisfactorily up to 1979, but worsened
after that year considerably.  Disappointing were the results achieved in
availability of locomoti-es.  The main reason was the country's difficult
foreign exchange position from 1980 onwards, and the lack of foreign ex-
change allocations for spare parts. However, the inadequate organization of
locomotive   maintenance   also   contributed   to  unsatisfactory   results.
Institution building was good. The role of CYR as a coordination agency for
Bank railway projects was very useful and was strengthened. This develop-
ment helped greatly to expedite the Sixth Railway Project which followed.
The re-evaluated rate of return on the project of 18% exceeds the appraisal
estimate of 15%. Overall, therefore, this was a successful project.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA: FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1534-YU)
Letter from CYR of June 9, 1980
The suppliers of track materials RMK Zenica and Masinska Industrija
Nis, BOAL for bolts, addressed us with a request to alter the timing of de-
livery under the concluded contracts and on that basis to approve the price
increase in accordance with contract conditions. The YR Commission in charge
with procurement of track materials considered these requests and found them
to be in accordance with contract provisions and proposed the Investors to
regulate  these  changes  in  contracts  by  annexes,  with  the  following
justification:
1. Subject to Article 7 of the Contract the Buyer is bound to submit
to the Seller 30 days before contracted delivery date the transport in-
structions. As the Contracts became effective at the end of December 1978 and
beginning of January 1979, the delivery could have been started, if there were
no other impediments, only in February 1979.  In relation to contracted de-
livery terms the delays on this account were 4 months for contracts with MIN
Nis and 1 month for contracts with RMK Zenica.
2. On the basis of the Law on Provision of Payments between Users of
Social Assets the Buyer is bound to submit to the seller before the beginning
of delivery a document by which he will guarantee that the payments against
deliveries shall be duly effected. Namely, the Buyers shall deposit with the
Bank the funds in the total value of the contract, or to get a guarantee of
their business bank for the same amount. Owing to an inadequate interpreta-
tion of this regulation the obtaining of these documents took several months
so that this legal obligation was met during the period from March 30 to June
29, 1979.
Having considered the Sellers' requests, the YR commission proposed
for delivery dates under all contract to be postponed so that the beginning
should  be  in  the  second  quarter  of  1979.   On  this basis,  the quarterly
tranches are not changed, only the delivery dates are postponed by two quar-
ters for contracts with MIN-Nis and by one quarter for contracts with RMK
Zenica.
Subject to contract provisions, the YR Commission accepted that along
with the postponement of timing of delivery the increase of prices should be
regulated.

Annex 1
page 2
For Annexes with MIN-Nis, the calculation was made according to the
agreed formula and it was found that the price increase is 31.1%. However,
subject to Section 1.6 of the Special Bidding Documents, only 82 increase is
permitted. As the contracts became effective by the end of 1978 and beginning
of 1979, the increased prices shall be applied to the deliveries scheduled for
1980 by the Annexes.
For Annexes with RMK Zenica for quantities to be delivered in 1980,
according to the Annexes, already contracted prices for that year were
calculated.
