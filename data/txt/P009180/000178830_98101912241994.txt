APPRAISAL OF
A FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Yugoslavia's 1976-80 Development Plan emphasizes the development
of industries using domestic raw and semi-processed materials, which depend
to a considerable extent on rail transport. The 1976-80 railway Investment
Plan, totaling US$2.7 billion, contains investments and priorities closely
related to the National Plan. The proposed Project would consist of the
three-year 1978-80 tranche of the railways' Investment Plan, totaling US$2.0
billion with a foreign exchange component of US$0.8 billion. The Bank's
US$100 million loan would thus amount to 5% of the cost of the Project and
12% of its foreign exchange component.
ii.       In the past, Yugoslavia's transport system has developed more
slowly than other sectors of the economy. Since 1970, it has attracted an
increasing share of investments, but much remains to be done. Traffic has
been rising fairly rapidly, at 6.5% p.a. for freight and 12.5% for passengers
during 1965-1975. Though the increase has been much less on railways than on
roads, the railways carry about 40% of Yugoslavia's total freight traffic and
24% of public passenger traffic, and have remained the dominant carriers of
heavy bulk for key industries. Government authorities have recently been
giving increasing attention to improving transport policy, and this has led to
the inclusion in the recent Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU) of studies
of road user charges and railway costs, to provide a firm basis for policy
decisions.
iii.      Eight independent Railway Transport Enterprises (RTEs) make up the
Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR). An important current development
stemming from recent Government policies is the formation of Communities of
Interest (COIs), each consisting of a railway enterprise and its users, to
which Government responsibilities for railways are being transferred. COIs
have been established for five enterprises and have already initiated action
for improving railway efficiency and for securing governmental assistance for
the resolution of surplus staff problems. Railway management is competent,
but planning and decision-making are complex processes with extensive interac-
tions between management and the workers' councils of each RTE and of its
constituent units.
iv.       Most of the main lines, comprising a quarter of the railway network,
have been electrified, largely as part of Bank projects. Modernization of
signaling and telecommunications is being completed on electrified lines,
and is needed on other lines. Modern traction and rolling stock have been
purchased, but more is needed; at the beginning of the 1976-80 Plan period
the railways were still operating a substantial number of steam locomotives
and obsolete freight cars. There is an urgent need for track overhaul,
because for some years only about half the necessary track overhaul has
been carried out, due to lack of funds.



- ii -
v.        The Bank has lent US$676 million on 15 transport projects, includ-
ing, during 1963-74, US$248 million for four railway projects. Since the
1965 economic reforms the railways have had serious financial problems, which
led to substantial delays in project execution. The last project therefore
included provisions for resolving these problems, principally by tariff
increases. However, since mid-1975 increases have been limited principally
because of the Government's anti-inflationary policies, resulting in substan-
tial increases in subsidies. The Bank made strong representations on this
issue, and under the terms of a recent Social Agreement the Government authori-
ties have agreed to "adjust freight rates in accordance with pricing policy
in the current year." Assurances have been obtained that the railways will
take all action in their power to obtain annual tariff increases to compensate
for inflation during the previous twelve-month period. Past inflation will be
dealt with by compensation payments, which are a key provision of that Agree-
ment. Those payments, which are to replace general subsidies, will be fixed a
year in advance, thus enabling forward planning and financial discipline, and
will be linked to traffic volume and operating efficiency. They are expected
to decrease as a result of increases in tariffs, traffic and efficiency, and
the RTEs have undertaken to use their best efforts so that tariff revenues for
Yugoslav Railways as a whole will comprise not less than 85% of total operating
revenues in 1980 and subsequent years.
vii.      As part of the Fourth Project the railways have implemented com-
prehensive Action Plans, addressing all facets of their organization and
activities. In particular, plans have been prepared for the procurement and
utilization of principal assets and these plans, together with feasibility
studies financed from the fourth loan, played a key part in shaping the US$2.7
billion 1976-80 Investment Plan.
viii.     The main objective of the Investment Plan is to modernize the rail-
ways so as to improve their efficiency and competitiveness. Its main com-
ponents are track and station overhaul and reconstruction (37%); signaling and
telecommunications (14%); traction and rolling stock (27%); miscellaneous
including some additional electrification (16%); and new construction (6%).
The composition of the US$2.0 billion Project is similar. The Plan has been di-
vided into Part A, consisting of investments which are to proceed as scheduled,
and Part B, whose execution will depend on adequate financial and physical
resources being available and, in appropriate cases, on additional evidence of
economic viability. Part B investments average by cost 15% of the 1976-80
Investment Plan and 19% of the 1978-80 Project. Part B investments, together
possibly with the completion of some Part A investments, may be postponed by
about two years, but this would not affect significantly the benefits of the
Project. Assurances have been received that no material changes will be made
in the Investment Plans without consultation with the Bank, and that certain
changes will not be made without the Bank's agreement. Assurances have also
been received that the railways will continue to update and implement their
Action Plans, including manpower plans which shall cover staffing requirements
and surplus staff, and plans for the procurement and utilization of principal
assets.



- iii -
ix.       Republican and Provincial Governments have undertaken, under the
terms of a Social Agreement on railway development, to make available funds
required for the Investment Plan as a whole. Funds firmly identified should
cover about 90% of both Plan and Project expenditures, with railways' internal
funds accounting for 31% of project total.
x.        The US$100 million Bank loan would be lent to CYR, and on-lent to
the eight RTEs. CYR will be responsible for loan administration and aoordina-
tion of technical assistance and staff training, and each RTE will be respon-
sible for executing its part of the project. US$92.5 million of the loan
would finance rails and other steel materials for urgently-needed overhaul of
about 1000 km of track and reconstruction of about 50 km, and US$7 million
would finance equipment for the electrification of about 200 km of line.
Procurement will be by ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. The remaining
US$0.5 million would finance technical assistance and staff training.
xi.       The Project is justified by the railways' role in the economy, par-
ticularly in view of the increased demand for transport of bulk commodities
stemming from the National Plan, and because of the Government's increased
emphasis on energy conservation and environmental considerations. The economic
rate of return for the Project, and also for the Plan, has been estimated at
15%, on the basis of decreased transport costs and improved efficiency. The
risk that this return would not be achieved is small.
xii.      On the bases of the assurances and undertakings which have been
received and which are set forth in this report, the Project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$100 million to CYR, to be re-lent to the RTEs, for a term of
15 years including three years of grace.






APPRAISAL OF
A FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(SFRY) and the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) have asked the Bank to
participate in financing the Yugoslav Railways' 1976-80 Investment Plan, which
totals about US$2.7 billion (including contingencies) with a foreign exchange
component of about US$1.1 billion. The proposed US$100 million loan to CYR
would support a project consisting of a three-year (1976-80) tranche of the
above Investment Plan. Project investments would total US$2.0 billion with
a foreign exchange component of US$0.8 billion. The loan would thus amount
to about 5% of the cost of the project, and 12% of its foreign exchange
component.
1.02      The railway investments and priorities are closely related to the
implementation of the national 1976-80 Plan, which gives increased emphasis
to the development of industries using domestic raw and semi-processed mate-
rials (coal, ores, steel, cement, etc.) suitable for rail transport. The
railway Investment Plan has been shaped to a considerable extent by planning
techniques, including feasibility studies, introduced as part of the Fourth
Railway Project. Institution-building would continue under the proposed
Fifth Railway Project and would include measures for improving the railways'
financial position and for phasing out subsidies. The proposed loan would
be the fifth for railways and the sixteenth for transport in Yugoslavia.
As previous loans, it would be disbursed against priority infrastructure
expenditures, for which other loans are not easily available.
1.03      This report was prepared on the basis of information provided by
the Yugoslav authorities, the railways, and the findings of several Bank
missions including appraisal missions which visited Yugoslavia in November
1976 and May 1977 consisting of Messrs. L. L. Alston (Engineer), J. C.
McCombie (Financial Analyst), 0. J. Rahkonen (Economist), R.A.D. Loven
(Consultant) and A. S. Chandler (Consultant).
II.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   The Transport System
2.01      Yugoslavia's transportation system is extensive and diversified,
comprising 10,000 km of railways, 98,400 km of roads, seven main ports and
15 airports (ten of which handle international flights) and a sizeable network
of inland and coastal waterways (the main one being the Danube). Pipelines
have come into increasing use in recent years. Yugoslavia borders seven coun-
tries (map) and has extensive access to the Adriatic; it is thus an important



-2-
crossroads for European traffic, including traffic to the Middle East. Its
transport system has traditionally provided sea access for central European
countries and is becoming increasingly important for international tourism.
2.02      Yugoslavia's economy has grown rapidly since World War II with per
capita income rising in real terms at about 6% yearly during the last decade
to reach US$1480 in 1975.  Increasing economic activity and personal incomes
(combined with continued diversification of the economy) have led to a fairly
rapid growth in transport demand; between 1965 and 1975 freight and passenger
traffic grew at about 6.5% and 12.5% yearly (Tables 1 and 2).
2.03      The growth of traffic by different modes has been rather uneven.
Between 1965 and 1975 the freight traffic (ton-km) on railways increased by
about 2% per annum compared to 13% on highways while passenger traffic. on
railways declined by about 2% per annum and increased by 20% per annum on
highways. The development of highway traffic is also demonstrated by the
increase in the motor vehicle fleet (Table 3) and modernization of the highway
network (Table 4). As a result, road transport has replaced rail transport as
the dominant carrier. The railways however continue to be the main carrier of
bulk materials important for key industries (Table 5) and carry about 40% of
the total freight (Table 1). The railways' share of public passenger traffic
is 24% (Table 2). River transport has retained an important and competitive
place, carrying about 10% of total freight traffic. The ports have almost
doubled their cargo handling since 1964 and currently move about 20 million
tons per annum (Table 6).
2.04      During the early 1960s transport facilities developed more slowly
than other sectors in the economy and accounted for only about 10-11% of total
investment, the lowest in Europe. The position has improved and transport has
accounted for about 16-18% of the total investments since 1970, but in view of
the considerable gaps in the transport infrastructure, the resources devoted
to the sector appear to have been insufficient and much remains to be done.
One of the most urgent needs at present facing the transport sector is modern-
ization of railways, which has been delayed for lack of funds. In this con-
text, Government support measures should be paralleled by improved utilization
of railway capacity and extensive marketing and promotional efforts. Also the
capacity of some ports needs to be increased, and many roads are still below
standard for the traffic they carry, needing improvements to handle traffic
efficiently and economically.
B.   Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
2.05      Since the mid-1960s the Yugoslav system has been increasingly
characterized by decentralization of decision-making with enterprises operat-
ing under workers' management in a market-oriented economy. Principal govern-
mental responsibility for transport was transferred during the late 1960s from
Federal to Republican and Provincial authorities. The Federal Secretariat for
Transport was replaced in 1975 by a Federal Committee, whose Chairman and Vice
Chairman are Federal officials, and other members are the Republican and
Provincial officials responsible for transport. This committee has a largely



- 3 -
coordinating function. Much of governmental responsibility is now being
transferred to Communities of Interest (COIs), which consist of one or more
transport enterprises and their users; normally, a COI covers only one Republic
or Province. It is intended to form in due course associations of such Com-
munities for coordinating purposes. Transport enterprises, including the
railways, are generally constituted as associations of Basic Organizations of
Associated Labor (BOALs), each consisting typically of a few hundred workers.
The BOALs are the prime sources of authority in the enterprise, and enjoy a
large measure of autonomy.
2.06      The extension of autonomy to the "grass roots" agencies and trans-
port organizations has increased the number of decision-making bodies, and
made the country-wide transport planning and coordination (especially between
road and rail) more difficult. Until recently there has not existed an over-
all, clearly stated transport policy, although the basic rationale for such
a policy has been implicit in the country's main economic principles: free
choice by users and competition in a market economy among autonomous transport
enterprises. In late 1976, however, with a view to creating the necessary
conditions for integrated development of transport, the Federation, the
Republics and the Autonomous Provinces mutually agreed to establish a long-
term transport policy for the country. Considerable progress has been made
in this direction, and the authorities are concluding Social Agreements on
the various aspects of future transport policy. Much of the success in trans-
lating the transport policy into a concrete action program will depend on the
decentralized decision-making process.
2.07      The Yugoslav authorities are also acutely aware of the need for a
satisfactory institutional framework within which various transport agencies
and enterprises can collaborate effectively. The Bank has contributed to
institution-building policies resulting in:
(i) the establishment of the Federal Committee (originally a
Secretariat) for Transport and Communications;
(ii) the establishment of the Secretariats or Committees for
Transport in most Republics and Provinces;
(iii) strengthening the CYR (para. 3.04).
2.08      Further improvements are still needed and, for this purpose, a
Social Agreement on Transport Policy has been signed, setting out the general
objectives of Yugoslav transport policy, indicating measures to be taken to
achieve them, and delineating more clearly the responsibilities of the Federal,
Republican and Provincial Governments and the COI's in the transport sector.
Objectives include the setting up of an optimal structure for the transport
system by harmonizing the development of the various transport modes, the
lowering of the share of transportation costs in the total costs of the
economy, and the rationalization of energy use and the reduction of energy
imports. The use of rail and water transport is to be encouraged for long
and medium distance commodity hauls and of road transport for short hauls.
The development of integrated transport facilities is also to be encouraged.



- 4 -
Emphasis is placed on the development of the public transportation sector as
compared to transport on own account. Regulations regarding permitted speeds,
axle loadings and capacities for highways generally are also to be re-examined.
Some concrete measures are already being formulated by the Republics and on
the Federal level; for example, the price of gasoline was increased in March
1977 by 35% (98 octane) to 37% (86 octane), while the price of diesel fuel was
increased by 22%. These increases will improve the competitive position of
the railway because of its greater fuel efficiency. The basic principle of
the transport policy will continue to be free competition on the market and
the main policy instruments will be pricing measures and the imposition of
minimum safety and environmental standards. For this reason, and to promote
transport coordination more effectively, the need is becoming increasingly
pressing for studies on road user charges and on railway costs to ascertain
and eventually eliminate overt and hidden subsidies or cross-subsidies.
2.09      The recently approved Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU) includes
as an important component, therefore, a study of Road User Charges as well as
a corresponding Rail Costs Study. These studies, outlined in Annexes I and 2,
are expected to provide a firm basis for the efficient and economic utiliza-
tion and coordination of transport facilities.
C.   Previous Projects
2.10      The proposed project would be the sixteenth for the transport sector
and the fifth for the railways. The Bank has lent US$676 million equivalent
to the transport sector, including US$276 million for eight highway projects,
US$108 million for two pipeline projects, US$44 million for the Port of Bar
Project, and US$248 million for four earlier railway projects. Annex 3 gives
details of these projects.
III. THE RAILWAYS
A.   General
3.01      Railway organization reflects Yugoslavia's political system.  The
Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR) is in effect an agency of Yugoslavia's
separate and independent railway enterprises. Up to the beginning of 1978
it comprised five Railway Transport Enterprises (RTEs), each serving a
Socialist Republic (SR) and named after its capital city (Table 7). Excep-
tionally, RTE Belgrade served SRs Serbia and Montenegro, and the Socialist
Autonomous Provinces (SAPs) Kosovo and Vojvodina. However, as from March
1978, RTE Belgrade will be divided into four independent enterprises called
Railway Transport Organizations (RTOs), each serving a Republic or Province. -I
1/   Each RTO is also named after its capital city (Table 7).  RTE Belgrade
will cease to exist after March 1978. There will be no significant dif-
ference in the status of RTEs and RTOs.



- 5 -
The RTOs will be associated with the RTEs in CYR. Appraisal documentation
submitted by RTE Belgrade has not yet been subdivided to correspond to the
RTOs, but the RTOs and CYR have undertaken that: (i) the RTOs will jointly
accept the obligations which would have been incumbent upon RTE Belgrade; (ii)
documentation for each RTO, including financial statements and forecasts, and
Investment Plans will be submitted to the Bank within six months of loan sign-
ing; (iii) CYR will assist the RTOs in preparing the above documentation, and
in setting financial and operational targets so that in aggregate they equal
the targets set for RTE Belgrade; and (iv) the RTOs will submit their Action
Plans (paras 4.19, 4.20) to the Bank before the loan is made effective.
Throughout this report the term RTE will embrace all railway enterprises and
organizations, and RTO will be used only where necessary to differentiate
between the new RTOs and the other RTEs. 1/
3.02      RTEs operate commercially, with CYR coordinating main decisions.
They vary considerably in size, as shown in Table 7. RTE Zagreb has about
ten times the length of line and 36 times the traffic of RTO Titograd. The
two largest enterprises, RTE Zagreb and RTO Belgrade, together carry half of
Yugoslavia's railway traffic, while the three smallest, RTE Skopje, RTO
Pristina and RTO Titograde, together carry only about a twentieth. Neverthe-
less, these small RTEs deserve special consideration because they serve some
of the less-developed regions of Yugoslavia. Traffic density is highest in
Sarajevo, serving heavy industries centered around the Zenica Mining and
Metallurgical Combine and only slightly lower in Zagreb and Ljubljana, serving
the more developed regions. The RTEs' subsidiary interests include road
transport, tourist offices, hotels, restaurants, and research and design
institutes. RTE Sarajevo operates the port of Ploce.
B.   Community of Yugoslav Railways
3.03      Three quarters of traffic is inter-enterprise, so that operations
are highly interdependent. RTEs have, by law, established the CYR, which
serves as a forum for common decisions and as an executing agency for joint
operations (for example, timetables, wagon utilization, revenue distribution,
planning methodology, and inputs to Government planning). It also represents
RTEs at Federal and International levels and sets safety and technical stand-
ards.
3.04      CYR's role diminished during the earlier part of the decentraliza-
tion process but since about 1974, with Bank support, it has been made more
active, particularly in planning and in discussions at the Federal level of
tariff increases and governmental suppcrt to all RTEs. During the preparation
of the Fourth Project the RTEs concluded a self-management agreement enabling
CYR to increase its planning, research and marketing activities, and to define
1/   When individual RTEs or RTOs are referred to the term RTE Belgrade will
be used only to designate the RTE which served Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo
and Vojvodina. The RTO which will serve Serbia (Table 7) will be referred
to as RTO Belgrade.



- 6 -
common objectives. The CYR is fulfilling a useful planning and coordination
function, and has been particularly active in recent Government discussions on
transport policies. It is the Borrower for the Bank's fourth loan, respon-
sible for reporting on the project and for coordinating technical assistance,
and will have similar functions for the fifth project. In particular, assur-
ances have been received that (i) CYR's function will be developed in connec-
tion with technical/economic analyses, and the application of the results of
the railway costing and road user charge studies (para. 2.09); (ii) CYR will
assist the RTEs in preparing and implementing their Action Plans (paras. 4.19,
4.20) and in implementing the procedures agreed for amending their Investment
Plans (para. 4.06); and (iii) CYR will assist the RTOs in preparing individual
Investment Plans and in setting targets aggregating to those set for RTE
Belgrade (para. 3.01).
C.   Communities of Interest
3.05      Government authorities are transferring much of their responsibili-
ties for railways to COIs (para. 2.05), each including an RTE or RTO and its
users. These COIs will constitute the prime link between the railways and the
economy, and will be responsible for the development and implementation of
railway policies covering traffic, financing and investment plans. COIs#have
so far been established in five out of eight Republics and Provinces. They
have already taken steps to improve railway efficiency and have secured the
assistance of Governments and local organizations in resolving problems of
surplus staff and uneconomic lines and services. Arrangements are being made
for the formation of COIs in the rest of the country (Annex 4). The system
has considerable merit because COI members will provide the bulk of compensa-
tion payments for railways (para.3.06) so that there is an inbuilt incentive
to the COIs to seek improvements in the railways' efficiency. Furthermore,
the system is consistent with the tight price controls imposed by the Yugoslav
authorities as part of their anti-inflationary policies.
D.   Social Agreement on Economic Measures
3.06      A Social Agreement on Economic and Other Measures to Provide Normal
Economic Conditions for the Railways (SAE) was signed by the Federal,
Republican and Provincial Governments in June 1977 with the aim of making the
railways financially and economically viable.  Its (iost important provision
is for the restoration of the railways' financial position by means of com-
pensation payments. The scale of compensation is to be fixed a year in
advance in order to facilitate forward planning and financial discipline but
the actual payments will vary with traffic volume and operating efficiency
and will give a strong incentive for the improvement of efficiency. The
details of making and funding the payments will be worked out separately in
each Republic and Province. In some Republics funds will be raised by a COI
levy upon its members while in others a special Government levy on economic
organizations will finance the compensation payments. In all cases COIs will
be closely concerned with the forecasts of traffic and costs on which the
payments are based as well as with the raising of funds and method of payment.



- 7-
E.   Previous Railway Projects
3.07      The Bank made four loans to Yugoslav Railways totalling US$248
million during 1963-74. Since 1965, when extensive economic and political
reforms were made in Yugoslavia, the railways have had serious financial
problems. Project execution suffered substantial delays, largely because
of these problems, but also because of deficiencies of project planning and
management. The last project therefore included provisions for resolving
the financial problems, principally by tariff increases, and for comprehensive
Action Plans to improve management and operations.
3.08      The timing of that project coincided with the energy crisis and the
economic recession which affected Yugoslavia and its trading partners. Two
large tariff increases were made, but since mid-1975 tariff increases have
been limited as part of the governments' anti-inflationary measures and
because of the railways' concern at loss of traffic (paras. 3.25 and 5.04).
This made necessary a substantial increase in Government subsidies in 1976,
and the Bank has made strong representations on this issue. The Yugoslav
authorities have now decided to replace by 1980 all general subsidies by
tariff increases and SAE compensation payments; the sum of all subsidies and
compensation payments will decrease steadily after 1977 in relation to tariff
revenues (para. 5.05).
3.09      Restrictions on tariff increases limited investment funds, and their
effect was compounded by anti-inflationary measures aimed at reducing the rate
of investment throughout the economy. As a result, only about two thirds of
project investments were executed by the end of 1976; these were reasonably
balanced to maximize system effects, and the remainder have been included in
the 1976-80 Investment Plan. The fifth project would therefore include certain
investments, estimated at 2% of its cost, against which part of the fourth
loan will be disbursed. No part of the fifth loan will be allocated to these
investments. Despite these delays, which resulted largely from financial
problems outside the railways' control, investment execution was significantly
better than for earlier projects. Meanwhile, however, institution-building
features of the Fourth Project progressed through the implementation of Action
Plans, which have had success, in particular, in sensitizing the railways to
market pressures, and in improving planning, especially for investments (paras
4.19, 4.20). More detailed information on previous projects is in Annex 3.
F.   Organization, Management and Staff
(a) Organization
3.10      Each RTE is organized as an association of BOALs (para. 2.05).
Internal organization is complex and varies between RTEs but, broadly, each
RTE has a director-general and three to five assistant directors, and each
RTE and BOAL has a workers' council to which management is responsible.
The Sarajevo organization for 1976 is shown in the chart, by way of example.
BOALs providing central services cover marketing, finance, planning, major
investments and personnel, while those responsible for operations cover
traffic, maintenance and subsidiary activities. BOALs engaged on purely
railway transport functions must by law join together in the RTE, but the



-8-
adherence of BOALs covering activities only partly related to the railways
is voluntary.
(b) Management
3.11      Management and decision-making are complex processes with extensive
interactions between management and workers' councils. Management, which has
always been technically competent in traditional railway disciplines, has
been strengthened substantially on planning and marketing during the last few
years. However, further progress is needed, especially in the evaluation of
investments, and in assessing the railways' competitive strength in relation
to other modes having regard to the results of the rail costing and road user
charge studies (para 2.09); assurances have been received that CYR will assist
the RTEs on these questions (para 3.04).
3.12      Traditionally, responsibility for executing investments had been
dispersed among specialized BOALs, whose activities had been coordinated by
central service departments. To increase the effectiveness of project manage-
ment under the fourth project, the RTEs grouped certain interdependent works
(such as electrification, signaling and track overhaul on a section of line)
into projects,, with an officer appointed for each, responsible for execution
in accordance with specifications within budget and time schedules. Although
the RTEs were short of suitable staff, this type of project management gave
satisfactory results, and the RTEs have undertaken to extend this management
system to certain works included in the fifth project. In view of the magni-
tude of this Project, assurances have also been received that the RTEs shall
be adequately staffed for planning, contracting and monitoring investments.
(c) Staff
3.13      Between 1965 and 1976 railway staff reduced by nearly 17,000 to
119,394.  Two factors hindered further reductions.  First, additional recruit-
ment became necessary because of a series of train accidents which resulted
in more stringent medical standards for operating staff and in restrictions
upon overtime work. Second, the slow-down in the economy during 1975 and the
first half of 1976 made it difficult to discharge redundant staff.
3.14      Against the present background of generally improving economic con-
ditions and with the active cooperation of governments and COIs, determined
efforts are being made to deal with overstaffing problems by early retire-
ments, re-training schemes, and direction of new industry to areas with
surplus staff. For the 1975-80 period, staff reductions of about 11,500 are
forecast including more than 5000 for the period 1975-78 (Table 8). On aver-
age, productivity is expected to increase by 10% by 1978 and nearly 30% by
1980 (Table 9). Assurances have been received that: (i) the RTEs will use
their best efforts to achieve these targets, and (ii) as part of its Action
Plan, each RTE will prepare a manpower plan which will contain future staff
requirements and probable recruitment sources, a methodology for identifying
surplus staff, and plans for retraining, transferring or retiring surplus
staff.

G.   Railway Property
(a) The Network
3.15      In 1976 there were 9967 km of railway in Yugoslavia (Table 10), 97%
standard gauge, 7% double track; 25% of the network was electrified. The
track has deteriorated for some years because only about half the necessary
400-500 km annual rehabilitation has been achieved. Much of the track is
still restricted to relatively low axle loads and speed restrictions have
been imposed. As part of the fourth project the RTEs have prepared compre-
hensive plans for track rehabilitation, which have formed the basis for the
1976-80 Investment Plans, and the proposed loan is intended to improve the
previous situation.
3.16      Modernization of signaling and telecommunications on electrified
lines is being completed under the Bank's third and fourth projects. Most
of the remainder of the railway still has mechanical signaling, substantially
as 40 years ago. High priority signaling and telecommunications investments
are included in the proposed project.
(b) Traction and Rolling Stock
3.17      In 1976 the RTEs had 1609 locomotives, including 799 diesel and
364 electric, procured mostly since 1965. Steam locomotives (43% over 35
years old) formed 28% of the total fleet but hauled only 6.5% of gross ton-kmi;
they are being phased out but some will remain in service after 1980.
3.18      The railways purchased about 9300 freight cars in the four-year
period 1973-76 to replace some 19,000 older, smaller-capacity cars. This
reduced the fleet to about 51,000 but increased capacity from 1.62 to 1.81
million tons, and left it with a fifth of the cars over 35 years old. During
the same period, 70 new passenger cars were procured and about 430 withdrawn,
reducing the fleet to about 3500, 1/ almost all built during the last 35
years. The Investment Plan contains provision for new traction and rolling
stock, summarized in Table 11, based on comprehensive Operational Plans (para
4.20) for optimizing the procurement and utilization of equipment, prepared as
part of the fourth project.
3.19      Maintenance costs for electric locomotives are higher in relation
to the cost of maintaining diesels than in other railways (Annex 8, para. 15).
CYR and RTEs have undertaken to carry out a study of maintenance practices
for electric locomotives, for which technical assistance could be financed
from the proposed loan.
(c) Operations
3.20      The share of total traffic (gross ton-km) hauled by steam traction
has fallen from over a third in 1970 to one fifteenth in 1976 (Table 10).
1/   This includes multiple unit stock.



- 10 -
Meanwhile, the share of electric traction has risen from nearly a third to one
half. One effect of these changes has been a decrease in diesel and electric
locomotive km-per-day, because diesel schedules had to include shorter runs
previously left for steam, while electric services were extended to replace
certain diesel services. Between 1974 and 1976 locomotive utilization was
also affected by the fall of traffic, but it remains satisfactory. Table 12
gives agreed targets for the utilization of traction and rolling stock, and
for locomotive availability. -
3.21      Availability had fallen below 80% for both diesel and electric
locomotives in 1972-73 due to technical factors and shortage of spares
resulting largely from lack of working capital. These problems are being
overcome; in 1976 availability was 85% for diesels and 89% for electrics,
and further improvements are expected.
3.22      Car utilization, measured in ton-km per freight car, has increased
by one third between 1970 and 1976 as bigger cars replaced the older cars.
Utilization per capacity of fleet has been stable since 1972 except for a
peak corresponding to the record traffic in 1974, but a significant increase
is now expected (Table 12). Turnaround time has been adversely affected by
the fall in traffic since 1974, but has nevertheless decreased slightly from
5.6 days in 1973 to 5.2 in 1976, and further decrease should be achieved.
Utilization of passenger cars has been satisfactory and an increase is fore-
cast.
3.23      Productivity compares satisfactorily with other European railways
as illustrated by Table 13.
H.   Tariffs
3.24      Freight rates are controlled by SFRY and passenger fares are fixed
by SRs and SAPs, but increases have been uniform for both. Common basic
freight rates apply but are adjusted for each RTE by a system of coefficients
which takes into account variations in costs and traffic densities. Standard
freight rates are increased sharply for less than full wagon loads and dis-
counts are given for large contracts. Many of the discounts are now being
withdrawn or considerably reduced as the RTEs realize that substantial revenue
has been lost by applying these reductions to bulk traffic which is captive to
railways. CYR and the RTEs have satisfactory procedures for relating tariffs
for various commodities and routes to corresponding costs, and the results of
the railway costing study (para 2.09) will be applied to tariffs through these
procedures. However, in total, both freight and passenger rates are presently
below cost because of Government restrictions on price increases as part of
its anti-inflation policy (para. 5.04).
I.   Traffic
3.25      In 1976 the railways carried 74 million tons of freight (28% inter-
national) about three quarters of which consisted of bulk commodities, and
127 million passengers (2% international) (Table 14). Between 1968 and 1974
freight ton-km rose by 41% (annual average 6%) while passenger km remained



- 11 -
virtually unchanged. Largely as a result of the slowdown of economic activity
in Yugoslavia and neighboring countries, ton-km and passenger-km fell by 9%
and 5% respectively between 1974 and 1976. However, this decline was arrested
in mid-1976 when traffic resumed a generally upward trend. Traffic forecasts
are discussed in paras. 6.04-6.08.
J.   Uneconomic Lines and Services
3.26      A methodology for the identification of uneconomic lines has been
established by CYR and has been agreed by all Governments except those of
SR Croatia and SR Macedonia (RTEs Zagreb and Skopje). Assurances have been
obtained that a suitable methodology will be applied in all Republics and
Provinces and that appropriate follow-up action will be taken on uneconomic
lines.
3.27      The railways have closed some 1900 km of uneconomic lines since
1965, including 550 km in the last two years, and a further 1400 km have been
identified by RTEs Belgrade, Ljubljana and Sarajevo and will be reviewed for
closure in the course of the next two years (Table 15), although about 160 km
of line may become private sidings. COIs in Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina
have concerned themselves directly with uneconomic lines and services and
certain passenger services have already been cancelled in RTE Sarajevo, while
in RTE Ljubljana it is proposed that uneconomic lines will become the respon-
sibility of regional COIs (Annex 4).
IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A.   General
4.01      The RTEs' 1976-80 Investment Plans (Table 16) total Dn 49.0 billion
(US$2.7 billion) with a foreign exchange component of Dn 20.4 billion (US$1.1
billion). The three-year Project (Table 17) covers investments in 1978-80,
and totals Dn 35.8 billion (US$2.0 billion) with a foreign exchange component
of Dn 14.7 billion (US$0.8 billion). The Bank's US$100 million loan will be
allocated to specific items in the project (Table 18), which total Dn 6.0
billion (US$331 million) with a foreign exchange component of Dn 2.4 billion
(US$135 million). The loan would account for 12% of the foreign exchange cost
of the project.
B.   The Investment Plan
4.02      The principal objective of the RTEs' Investment Plans is to modern-
ize railway facilities in order to improve efficiency and the competitive
position of the railways. These Investment Plans have been coordinated by
CYR, and their aggregate constitutes the Yugoslav Railways' Investment Plan.
This Plan is covered by a Social Agreement for Railway Development signed in
September 1976 between the Executive Councils of the Federation, Republics
and Provinces as part of the recent transport policy developments (para.
2.05). This Agreement indicates the approximate cost of the main groups of



- 12 -
investments needed in each RTE to enable the railways to fulfill their planned
role in the economy, and the signatories undertake to create the conditions
necessary to implement those investments.
4.03      The Investment Plans have been reduced by about a third in the
course of discussions with the Bank, and are based on planning techniques
introduced under the Fourth Project. Furthermore, at the Bank's recommenda-
tion, these Plans have been divided into two parts: Part A, consisting of
investments which are to proceed as scheduled, and Part B, whose execution
will depend on adequate financial and physical resources being available and,
in appropriate cases, on additional evidence of economic viability.  Part B
investments average by cost 15% of the 1976-80 Investment Plan and 19% of the
1978-80 Project. Part B investments, together possibly with the completion of
some Part A investments, may be postponed by about two years, but this would
not affect significantly the benefits of the Project. The Investment Plans,
about two thirds of which consist of replacements, are justified by the traffic
forecast and should enable the railways to meet their objectives in terms of
increased efficiency and quality of service.
4.04      The principal components of the Plan are:

4.05      These components include (Parts A+B) the overhaul of over 2000 km of
track; station and track reconstruction, principally to increase capacity;
modernization of signaling and telecommunications in about 400 stations; pur-
chase of 278 locomotives, 120 multiple-unit trains, 329 passenger cars and
6156 freight cars; miscellaneous investments including about 700 route-km of
electrification, and investments in marshaling yards, terminals and data-
processing facilities; new construction, including a second track about 100-km
long on a busy electrified line in RTE Sarajevo, completion of the Skopje pas-
senger station, construction by RTE Skopje of a 20-km line to a ferro-nickel



- 13 -
foundry and, in Part B, initiation of works on lines linking Skopje to the
Bulgarian and Albanian borders. 1/
4.06      CYR and the RTEs have given the following undertakings with respect
to their Investment Plans, which they have submitted to the Bank:
(i) They will not, without the Bank's consent:
(a) make any material reductions;
(b) make any changes in investments to which the Bank loan
is allocated;
(c) undertake or permit to be undertaken any group of related
investments whose cost is estimated to exceed US$10 mil-
lion, in new line construction, electrification or station
reconstruction, unless those investments are in Part A of
the Investment Plans already submitted to the Bank.
(ii)  They will not undertake or permit to be undertaken any other
material investments which are not now in Part A, unless appro-
priate technical/economic studies are made and the Bank is given
a reasonable opportunity to review them and to exchange views
with CYR or the RTEs concerned.
(iii)  They will review the Investment and Financing Plans with CYR
at least annually, taking into account traffic results and
trends, and propose any necessary revisions (in accordance with
(i) and (ii) above).
C.   Three-Year Project, 1978-80
4.07      The three-year project consists of the 1978-80 slice of the Invest-
ment Plan which is summarized below:
1/   The Plan does not include investments totaling about Dn 3.3 billion
(US$184 million) which are primarily a Republican or Municipal respon-
sibility and consist of: completion of the Belgrade-Bar line, which
constitutes the Bank's third project; construction of the Cacak-Pozega
line, which is an important feeder to the Belgrade-Bar line; and the
relocation, for urbanistic reasons, of the Belgrade Railway Station.
These investments have been reviewed and accepted during the appraisals

4.08      Three quarters of the Dn 35.8 billion (US$2.0 billion) expenditures
on the project are for infrastructure investments, and one quarter for trac-
tion and rolling stock; overall, 81% is for Part A investments. The invest-
ments to which US$99.5 million of the US$100 million Bank loan would be allo-
cated amount to about a sixth of Project expenditures and consist of track
works and electrification as detailed in paras 4.12 and 4.13 and in Table
17.  The remaining US$0.5 million would be allocated to technical assistance
and staff training (para. 4.13).
D.   Cost Estimates
4.09      Cost estimates have been prepared by the RTEs on the basis of quota-
tions and experience on similar works. For some investments they have been
confirmed by consultants. In calculating the foreign exchange component,
items were assumed to be imported only if contracts had already been placed,
or there was a high probability that they would be placed abroad. Where the
source of supply was uncertain, it was taken as domestic. However, import
contracts generally contain provision for substantial local manufacture, so
that even if the split between imports and domestic contracts differed from
forecast, the foreign exchange component would not alter substantially. In
general, cost estimates are satisfactory.
4.10      Physical contingencies of 10% have been included for all items ex-
cept those with a particularly firm limit on quantities, notably traction and
rolling stock. Estimates were based on mid-1975 prices and have been updated
to mid-1977 prices. At CYR's recommendation, which is acceptable, price con-
tingencies of 10% for each subsequent year have been allowed on the Investment
Plan as a whole. However, in calculating the Bank loan, price contingencies
were taken as 7% per annum for steel materials needed for track works, which



- 15 -
account for over 90% of the loan (para 4.12), and as 8% per annum for materials
and equipment for electrification.
E.   Financing Plans
4.11      Under the terms of the Social Agreement for Railway Development
(para. 4.02) the Republican and Provincial Governments have undertaken to make
available the finance required for the 1976-80 Investment Plans. Funds firmly
identified as yet cover about 90% of Plan and of Project costs for CYR as a
whole, but the percentages vary in different RTEs. Together with the proposed
Bank loan of US$100 million the proportion of identified finance for the
Project rises to 95% of the Project total and would be more than sufficient to
cover Part A investments in all RTEs. Internal funds including compensation
are expected to finance an increasing proportion of the Project rising from
24% in 1978 to 40% in 1980 and averaging 31% over the Project period.  Without
the compensation payments, the railways' internal funds would be insufficient
to contribute to investments during this period. Financing for the Project is
summarized below. 1/

1/   In addition, internal funds amounting to Dn 2.6 billion (US$144 million)
have been set aside by the BOALs of RTEs Belgrade and Sarajevo for local
investments not included in the Investment Plan or, in the case of RTE
Belgrade, to assist at the BOAL's discretion in financing certain invest-
ments included in the Plan. In Sarajevo, part of this amount will be
used to finance non-railway investments such as the port of Ploce.



- 16 -
The relatively small balance of funds necessary for the Plan and the Project
is actively being sought and its provision is not expected to give great dif-
ficulty. Domestic funds will be made available while additional foreign bank
loans totalling over US$30 million are currently in course of negotiation
through Belgrade banks. The proportion of firmly identified finance for the
Project is slightly better than for the Fourth Project at a similar stage and,
in view of the encouraging actions taken by governments and COIs, and partic-
ularly to the safeguard provided by the division of the Investment Plans into
Parts A and B, risks associated with the financing plan are considered accept-
able. A summary of internal resources and financing plans is shown in Table
21. Direct foreign loans and trade credits including the proposed US$100 mil-
lion Bank loan are estimated at US$400 million, about half the foreign exchange
component of the Project. The balance of foreign exchange will be made avail-
able from governmental sources.
F.   The Loan
(a) Disbursements
4.12      The proposed loan of US$100 million would finance about 5% of the
cost of the Project, and 31% of the cost of investments to which the loan
would be allocated. US$92.5 million of the loan would finance in full the
purchase of certain track materials (about 104,000 tons of rails, 38,000 tons
of track fastenings and 650 points, see Table 18) 1/ for about 1000 km of
track overhaul and 52 km of track reconstruction. These materials have been
selected for disbursing the loan for the following reasons. They are needed
for priority investments, having a far-reaching effect on railway operations.
Other loans are not normally available for them, and they ranked high on the
list of items proposed by the railways for Bank financing. Despite the
problems on earlier projects, there was little delay in the execution of simi-
lar works financed from the fourth Bank loan.
4.13      US$7 million of the proposed loan would finance a portion of the cost
of equipment needed for fixed installations for the electrification of about
200 km of line which carries substantial volumes of domestic raw materials
required for the Zenica and other steel plants and their expansion. The devel-
opment of these industries is receiving high priority in Yugoslavia's 1976-80
five-year development plan (para 6.01). Finally, US$500,000 of the proposed
loan would finance in full the cost of technical assistance and staff train-
ing, the major portion of which is expected to be provided by Yugoslav orga-
nizations. Technical assistance is envisaged for the preparation of the
Operational Plans for signaling and telecommunications (para. 4.20) and for
the study of locomotive maintenance (para 3.19), but may be extended to other
areas especially for newly-formed RTOs (para 3.01). Staff training is envis-
aged primarily for Project Managers (para 3.12).

funds remaining in the loan account after completion of the investments

- 17 -
would be used for other items in the Investment Plan which are suitable for
ICB, subject to review and approval by the Bank.
(b) Lending Arrangements
4.15      The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the Federal Government and
would be made to CYR for a 15-year period including three years of grace. Of
the loan, US$99.5 million would be transferred to the RTES by Subsidiary Agree-
ments on the same basic terms and conditions as the Loan Agreement. The loan
balance of US$0.5 million would be allocated initially to CYR for technical
assistance and staff training and transferred later to RTEs if and when neces-
sary.  The allocation of the loan is summarized below:
RTE                       US$ million
RTO Belgrade                       13.6
RTO Novi Sad                       13.2
RTO Pristina                        9.0
RTO Titograd                        4.5
RTE Zagreb                         16.7
RTE Ljubljana                      13.4
RTE Sarajevo                       18.5
RTE Skopje                         10.6
Investment Subtotal          99.5
Technical assistance and
staff training                   0.5
Total                       100.0
4.16      Conditions of loan effectiveness are that all Agreements have been
duly executed and authorized by all governmental and corporate action; that
Investment and Financing Plans already transmitted to the Bank have been duly
approved by the Enterprises and authorities concerned; that Action Plans
(including Operational Plans) for the RTEs and the Action Plan for CYR have
been transmitted to the Bank and approved by the RTEs, CYR and the authorities
concerned; and that the Republics and Provinces have adopted decisions which
will make available to the RTEs part of the funds needed for the investments
to which the loan is allocated, and also any additional funds needed for the
timely completion of those investments. Although 220 days elapsed between
loan signature and effectiveness for the fourth railway project, it is esti-
mated that only 120 days will elapse for this project because of a general
decrease in the time needed for effectiveness on Yugoslav projects and because
of preparatory work which CYR is expected to undertake before signature.
G.   Implementation
Responsibility
4.17      Each RTE will be responsible for executing its part of the project.
Technical assistance and staff training will be made available to or through



- 18 -
CYR, which will be responsible for loan administration. Undertakings were
given that the CYR panel set up for administering the fourth loan will be
strengthened; and that consultants for technical assistance and staff train-
ing will be employed in accordance with Bank guidelines, and that qualified
counterparts will be appointed.
Procurement
4.18      Contracts will be placed by ICB in accordance with the Bank's pro-
curement guidelines.  Domestic firms would be permitted to participate in the
bidding and would be accorded a preference of 15% or the customs duty, which-
ever is lower. Over 90% of the loan would be disbursed on the purchase of
steel materials for track works (para. 4.12), and in view of the world market
conditions which currently reflect substantial over-capacity for their produc-
tion, it is not possible to assess the extent to which Yugoslav manufacturers
are likely to be successful under ICB procedures; however, even if they suc-
ceeded in winning all contracts, the loan would still represent only a small
percentage of the total foreign exchange cost of the project and would be less
than the foreign exchange component of the investments to which it is allo-
cated. 1/ To achieve the full benefits of ICB, CYR and the RTEs have under-
taken to give bidders the opportunity of quoting for only some of the types
and part of the quantities of track materials.
H.   Action Plans
4.19      Railway decisions may involve, besides each RTE and its BOALs and
COI, SFRY, SR and SAP Governments as well as organizations such as the
Chambers of Economy. This led, under the Fourth Project, to the establishment
by CYR and by each RTE of comprehensive Action Plans which are an important
instrument for reaching a common understanding by all concerned on objectives
and responsibilities, and on the measures and time required for their achieve-
ment. Action Plans are also important for extending the planning process in
the RTEs and beyond. They address themselves to improvements in organization,
planning, investments, marketing, productivity, information systems, finance,
Government support and staff training. They specify actions to be taken to
achieve productivity, operational and financial targets. A summary of actions
discussed in the various chapters of this report is given in Annex 5. Appro-
priately updated, these Action Plans have a continuing role in the development
of the Yugoslav railway system. Assurances have been obtained that CYR and
the RTEs will continue to implement and update their Action Plans, under suit-
able monitoring systems.
1/   In calculating the US$102 million foreign exchange component given in the
table in para. 4.07 for investment to which the loan would be allocated,
it was assumed that steel materials for track works would be procured
locally, but some of the materials and equipments for electrification
would be imported. If all materials and equipment were procured locally,
the foreign exchange component would fall to US$99 million, which, with
contingencies, amounts to about US$130 million; these amounts exceed the
corresponding loan allocations of US$77.6 million and US$99.5 million
respectively.



- 19 -
4.20      As part of their Action Plans, the RTEs have prepared Operational
Plans to improve the utilization of their assets and to serve as a basis for
procurement, renewal and scrapping of equipment. These plans cover traction,
rolling stock (illustrated in Annex 5, paras 3-7), workshops, signaling, tele-
communications, data processing and integral transport. In general, they have
been well prepared, but some improvements are needed. Assurances have been
received that the RTEs will:
(a)  continue to update and implement their Operational Plans in
collaboration with CYR;
(b) elaborate in particular the Operational Plans on signaling
and telecommunications on the basis of terms of reference
agreed with the Bank, and with technical assistance as
required.
Risks
4.21      In light of what was stated regarding the performance under the pre-
vious railway projects (paras 3.06-3.08), it is recognized and accepted that
the continuing aim of ensuring the financial viability of the railways might
again prove difficult to attain. We do, however, have considerable grounds
for optimism, not the least being the Government's own firm commitment towards
achieving the goal. The formation of COIs is an additional reason for con-
fidence, inasmuch as they, as users of the railway, are not only concerned
with the costs of services, but also with the quality of services. There is
built-in pressure for them to become vigilant overseers of railway operations
trying to ensure that the railways work as efficiently as possible and provide
the quality and quantity of service desired. Insofar as railway deficits pose
a burden on them, they would also wish to ensure that the tariff structure is
appropriate.
4.22      Attainment of financial targets and of the forecast economic rate of
return are discussed in paras 5.06 and 6.13, where it is seen that risks are
acceptable. Insofar as physical implementation and continued improvements in
planning and operations are concerned, past experience as well as the quality
of management that is available do not suggest the presence of any significant
risks.
V. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      Railway accounts are kept separately by each RTE on a uniform
Government-prescribed basis. The accounts are kept to a good standard with
automatic data processing used to varying extents by the different RTEs.
As a result of the Bank's requirements, cash flow techniques are playing an
increasingly important role in the RTEs' accounting processes.



- 20 -
5.02      The importance of depreciation to the railways in ensuring an ade-
quate generation of internal funds was recognized by the Government which, in
1974, passed a law increasing depreciation rates for the various categories
of railway fixed assets. Fixed assets are subject to an annual revaluation
based on replacement costs and using coefficients obtained from price indices
of the Federal Institute of Statistics. Book values of assets are thus main-
tained at realistic levels and depreciation plays a proper role in funds
generation.
B.   Past Performance
5.03      Financial results show a poor record of achievement when compared
to the appraisal forecasts made for the last three loans. Forecast surpluses
have not been achieved because traffic forecasts have not been realized and
also because freight rates and passenger fares have failed to keep up with
inflation. Surpluses and deficits 1/ compared to appraisal forecasts are
shown below:

- 21 -
5.04      Rising costs and inadequate tariff increases with a consequent need
for Government subsidies have been a feature of railway finances in recent
years. In 1974 operating costs per traffic unit rose by nearly 30% and a
deficit of Dn 1.0 billion (US$61 million) resulted. An attempt was made to
remedy this position by tariff increases of 21.8% in June 1974 and 22% in
January 1975 but declining traffic and further inflation caused a 32% in-
crease in operating cost per traffic unit in 1.975 and a deficit of Dn 2.0
billion (US$118 million). A rigorous anti-inflation policy introduced by the
Federal Government with strict controls over prices brought a temporary halt
to the railways' efforts to seek viability through tariffs, and subsequent
tariff increases were limited to 8% in January 1976 and 8.5% in April 1977.
The deficit for 1976, before subsidies, reached Dn 4.6 billion (US$255 mil-
lion) of which it is estimated that about Dn 900 million (US$50 million) was
due to uneconomic lines and surplus staff. The Bank strongly urged a reversal
of this policy of subsidization and a return to viability through tariffs.
C.   Forecast Performance
5.05      Under the terms of SAE (para 3.06), the Federal, Republican and
Provincial Governments have agreed to "adjust freight rates in accordance
with pricing policy in the current year," and assurances have been obtained
that the railways will take all action in their power to obtain annual tariff
increases to compensate for inflation during the previous twelve-month period.
Past inflation, insofar as it is not yet covered by tariff increases, will be
dealt with by compensation payments 1/ made under the terms of SAE. It is
planned that these payments, which will be made currently, will decrease as a
result of increased traffic, higher tariffs, and greater operating efficiency,
and the RTEs have undertaken to use their best efforts to attain individual
financial targets so that tariff revenues for Yugoslav Railways as a whole
will comprise not less than 85% of total operating revenues in 1980 and
subsequent years. 2/  It is expected that specific subsidies will continue to
account for about Dn. 900 million (US$50 million) in 1980 and it is forecast
that by that time, non-tariff revenues (compensation payments and specific
subsidies) will have reduced as a proportion of total operating revenue by
about one third from the 1976 subsidy level as shown below:

for,RTEs Ljubljana and Zagreb.
2/   Forecasts are 79% for 1978 and 82% for 1979.



- 22 -
It was agreed that the Bank would be consulted during 1979 as to the means
to achieve further reduction and the ultimate elimination of compensation
payments after 1980. Yugoslav planning does not yet extend in detail beyond
the period of the 1976-80 Development Plan but tentative forecasts for the
period 1981-82 are for traffic growth continuing at about 4.5% per annum.
Unit costs are forecast to decrease in real terms with continued staff reduc-
tions and because of the increased traffic while compensation is seen as con-
tinuing to decrease so that tariff revenues comprise 90% of total revenues by
1982. Rate of return on net fixed assets (including compensation) is forecast
to remain at 3% in 1982 despite the fall in the compensation payments.
5.06      The principal criteria used in preparing the financial forecasts
for 1977-80 are summarized below: the main assumptions on which they are
based are given in Annex 7. Revenues reflect 1976 tariffs and forecast
changes in subsequent years and forecast traffic levels. Working expenses
are based on 1976 figures and adjusted for inflation at approximately 10%
per year, the rate assumed for price contingencies on capital expenditure
(para. 4.10). After interest charges, forecast net surpluses and principal
ratios are as shown below:

The forecast are sensitive to traffic growth and tariff increases. Traffic
results in 1977, economic developments which increase the demand for rail
transport, and the recent Social Agreements, support the view that the traffic
forecasts are realistic (paras 6.01-6.08). Assurances have been received on
tariff increases (para 5.05). If traffic or tariff deficiencies should never-
theless occur, then adjustments in expenditures could be made under the rolling
system of planning; for example, by delaying Part B investments. CYR and the RTEs
have undertaken to use their best efforts to achieve target operating ratios
shown in Annex 6. Income statements and forecasts are shown in Table 20.
D.   Cash Flow
5.07      Cash flow estimates for the project period are satisfactory.  Inter-
nal resources and financing plans are detailed in Table 21 while cash flow
figures from 1974 to 1980 are shown in Table 22. Gross internal resources
comprise more than half of total cash availability for both project and
plan periods while net internal resources should finance about 26% of the
investment plan, 31% of the project, and 39% of Part A during the project
period. Depreciation provisions are estimated to provide 78% of the internal



- 23 -
funds while the remaining 22% to be met from net revenues is considered to be
within the earning capacity of the RTEs. Cash flow should benefit particu-
larly from the change from annual deficit reimbursement in arrears to current
payment of compensation under the terms of SAE (para 3.06).
5.08      Average debt service coverage from internal funds including Govern-
ment subsidies was 1.7 in 1975 and 2.0 in 1976. This should improve to 2.8
by 1980 due to forecast increases in internal funds. An undertaking was
received that the RTEs would not incur debt beyond specified debt limitation
ratios (Annex 6) without consulting the Bank.
E.   Balance Sheet
5.09      Actual results for 1976 and forecasts for 1979 and 1980 (the end
of the project and plan periods) are summarized below while detailed figures
for the years from 1974 to 1980 are shown in Table 23.

Debt/Equity Ratio                   19/81         28/72          29/71
The increase in fixed asset values reflects the effect of annual asset revalua-
tions as well as of the investment program. The highest RTE debt/equity ratio
in 1980 is 35/65 which is acceptable. Details are given in Annex 6.
5.10      A main difficulty of the railways in recent years has been a short-
age of working capital. Inventories have been too low and operating cash, in
part due to inflation, has been inadequate. A better cash flow is expected
to improve both these figures during the plan period although the improvement
will be limited by a progressive reduction in compensation payments as tariff
revenues increase. Nevertheless, by 1980, cash and other working capital
are expected to rise on average to 8% and 22% respectively of cash working
expenses, and an undertaking was received that RTEs will use their best
efforts to ensure that in no RTE will these percentages be less than 8% and
20%, respectively, in 1980.



- 24 -
5.11      Rate of return on net fixed assets for 1976 was 1.7% reflecting the
Government's policy of limiting tariff increases and limiting subsidies to
actual deficit plus loan interest in recent years. The financial benefits
expected from the change from this policy are shown by a rate of return which
is forecast to increase steadily reaching 2.9% in 1980. Target rates of
return were agreed at negotiations as set out in Annex 6.
F.   Audit
5.12      The accounts of each RTE are subject to audit by the Social Account-
ing Service (SAS) in the course of which a considerable amount of detailed
work is carried out in verifying that the accounts are properly kept in
accordance with the prescribed accounting code. With the help of consultants,
the SAS is currently expanding its capacity for performing an audit such as
is normally required by the Bank of its borrowers but has not yet the capacity
to carry out such an audit for an organization of the size of the railways.
Assurances were obtained at negotiation that both CYR and the RTEs will have
their accounts audited in accordance with sound auditing principles consis-
tently applied, by the SAS or another competent and experienced independent
auditing organization, and that the certified accounts, together with the
auditors' reports, will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the
end of each year.
VI. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Project and National 1976-80 Development Plan
6.01      Yugoslavia's economic priorities have been recently modified as a
result of the shift over the past few years in international commodity prices.
Increased emphasis is now being given to the development of Yugoslavia's own
natural resources including energy (coal), at the expense of transforming
industries, which in the past received higher priority. The National 1976-80
Development Plan has been formulated on the basis of these revised objectives.
Relatively high growth rates, about 8.0% p.a., are envisaged within mining,
power generation and a number of other basic, heavy industries, compared with
an overall growth rate of 7.0% p.a. for the economy as a whole. The appraisal
has however been based on a slightly lower growth rate of 5.5% p.a., which is
in line with recent Bank assessments of economic performance.
6.02      In general, this shift in economic priorities will result in in-
creased transport requirements of heavy and bulky raw materials and semi-
finished products suitable for rail transport, although increased efforts are
being made to locate processing and energy-generating industries at raw mate-
rial sources. The evaluation of inter-industry linkages undertaken by the
Federal Institute of Social Planning for preparation of the 1976-80 plan
indicates that the railway investment programs will remain closely related
to the transport needs of high priority industries. This has been taken into
account in preparation of the 1976-80 plan and in drawing up the national
transport policy (para. 2.08). Furthermore, the increase in energy prices



- 25 -
and the greater emphasis being given to safety and environmental considera-
tions has let the Government give the railways higher priority than in the
past.
6.03      Parallel to the overall economic growth objectives, the reduction
in interregional disparities in development levels and generation of employ-
ment opportunities assume high priority in the 1976-80 plan. Considerable
emphasis is, therefore, being given to the development of the less developed
Republics and Kosovo, which are expected to obtain higher than average growth
rates. Much of this growth is to be achieved through expansion of the basic
industries generating substantial rail transport requirements. Although much
of the railway traffic is inter-Republic, these regional development objec-
tives result in different traffic growth rates from one railway enterprise to
another and are important in the formulation of individual railway projects
and investment plans.
B.   Traffic Forecasts
6.04      The expected development of railway freight and passenger traffic
during 1976-80 is outlined in Table 14. The overall annual growth rate for
that period, estimated at 4.6% on the basis of the depressed 1976 traffic
levels is realistic. This implies a growth rate of 2.1% p.a. for 1970-80,
which yields 37.1 billion traffic units 1/ in 1980, compared with 30.9 and
33.5 billion achieved in 1976 and 1974 respectively. Traffic results for the
first three quarters of 1977 are encouraging, being 8.3% above the correspond-
ing level in 1976, compared to the forecast 4.6% growth, or nearly twice the
annual growth rate forecast for 1976-80.
(a) Freight
6.05      Railway freight traffic has been estimated to increase by 5.5% p.a.
during the period 1976-80 (Table 14). This is realistic considering the
depressed traffic level in 1976 (for the first three quarters of 1977, freight
traffic in ton-km exceeded by 8.2% the 1976 level), the priorities of the
1976-80 Plan (para. 6.02) and the likely impact of transport policy measures
(paras. 2.08 and 2.09). The growth rate compares with Government estimates of
about 8% for all modes of transport and about 10% for that carried by road
and implies an annual growth rate of 3.0% over the 1970-80 period. The fore-
cast has been based on a detailed assessment of the future rail transport
requirements undertaken by each RTE. The preparation of such assessment is
facilitated by the fact that the railways have an extensive marketing orga-
nization with marketing and contract cells attached to all important indus-
tries or located at important terminals such as ports; as a result, above 80%
of the rail freight is carried on a contract basis. The railways possess an
intimate knowledge of the major industries and their expansion plans and
although the possibility of delay in completion of some of these plans is
recognized, the effect on the overall growth rate is likely to be minor and
can be corrected through the rolling system of planning and division of the
1/   Traffic units are the sum of ton-km and passenger-km.



- 26 -
Investment Plan into Parts A and B (para. 4.03). Setbacks in the overall
economic development (assessed at 5.5% p.a., para. 6.01) are, of course,
another factor which may affect the future development of rail traffic, but it
is expected that the gradual improvement in the railways' competitive position
(para. 2.08) will compensate for such adverse events. In preparation of the
forecast, no consideration was given to the possible effect of various trans-
port policy measures planned or undertaken, such as the increase in fuel
prices (para. 2.08), which can-do nothing else than provide further support
to the rail traffic forecast.
6.06      Bulk traffic accounts for three quarters of railway freight, which
is fairly evenly distributed over several commodity groups, none of which
accounts for more than 15% of the total. 1/ The overall growth rate is thus
not excessively dependent on a single commodity. The most important com-
modity, coal, accounted for 15% of total freight in 1976 and is expected to
grow at about 4.1% p.a., while oil products (8.2% of total freight in 1976)
are expected to grow at 5.1% p.a. This reflects a shift from the 1970-75
energy policy when coal traffic declined while oil traffic increased at about
9% p.a., and results from the Government's commitments to the development of
domestic energy sources and reduction of its balance of payments deficit.
6.07      Traffic of ores and concentrates (11.7% of total freight in 1976)
is expected to increase by about 7.6% p.a. High growth rates have been esti-
mated for cement and fertilizers, 13.6% and 8.9% p.a. respectively, but their
share of the total rail traffic is minor (together less than 5%). One of
the lowest growth rates, 3.6% p.a., is for the metallurgical industry (steel
sheets, pipes, nonferrous metals, etc.) which accounted for 13% of total rail-
way freight in 1976. These sectors are not expected to expand as fast as
basic industries, reflecting the Government's policy to reduce imports of raw
materials.
(b) Passengers
6.08      The growth in railway passenger traffic is estimated to be 2.8% p.a.
during the period 1976-80 (Table 14). This increase is fully attainable and
1/   Railway freight statistics and forecast give a breakdown by 10 major
commodities or commodity groups (Table 14). These account for about
three quarters of total railway freight. The remaining commodities are
grouped into one group ''other," and are expected to show an increase of
5.0% p.a. during the 1976-80 period. Although this group consists of a
large number of commodities, the 15 more important ones account for about
70% of the total traffic in this group; many of them closely related to
the needs and production of major industries. For some of these commod-
ities road/rail competition is likely to be considerable (e.g., textiles),
but the railways achieved a very high growth rate for this group as a
whole in the early 1970s (6.7% p.a. from 1970 to 1974). Also, the dropq
in rail transport of these commodities since 1974 was less than for
railway traffic in general. As a result, this group has increased
its share of the total rail traffic from 24% in 1970 to 27% in 1976.



- 27 -
may be even conservative in light of the recent shift to increased use of
railways. In the first eight months of 1977, railway passenger traffic was
8.7% above the same period of 1976. This increase has been explained in terms
of increased prices of fuel and private cars, and highway congestion. Although
eight months' results cannot be taken as a confirmed trend, they indicate that
the forecast growth rate of 2.8% per annum is not optimistic.
C.   1976-80 Investment Plan  -
6.09      The railways' 1976-80 Investment Plan, amounting to Dn 49.0 billion
(US$2.7 billion), has been described in paras. 4.02-4.06 and Table 16. The
economic evaluation has been undertaken by major investment components and
has been based on:
(i)  Action and Operational Plans prepared by the railways and
covering all major operational areas (paras. 4.19, 4.20);
(ii) feasibility studies for specific investments including
capital overhaul, reconstruction of lines and stations,
signaling and telecommunications, electrification, integral
transport and new line construction, undertaken by consul-
tants (Sofrerail, France) and Yugoslav transport research
institutions.
6.10      Operational Plans and feasibility studies cover about 90% of Part A
investments and three quarters of Part B. They are largely a result of the
major institution-building effort under the fourth project, which introduced
the preparation of Action and Operational Plans, supplemented by feasibility
studies for individual projects, as an integral part of the planning process,
which will be continued under the proposed project. In undertaking the eco-
nomic evaluation, all these plans and studies have been reviewed by the Bank.
For each major investment group (para. 4.07) and RTE, individual studies and
plans were selected for detailed examination; examples are given in Annex 8.
Special attention was given to investments, which appeared marginal in terms
of economic rate of return. The results were discussed with the RTEs and were
used in the formulation of the investment programs. A number of marginal
projects were either reformulated or postponed as a result of this review.
6.11      For capital overhaul and reconstruction of lines and stations, which
account for 41% of the Plan, 1/ and are essential for the efficient utiliza-
tion of locomotives and rolling stock, only the direct cost savings 2/ have
been taken into account, to the exclusion of such benefits as replacement of
1/   This includes double tracking totaling Dn 1.45 billion (US$81 million)
included under new construction in para. 4.04.
2/   Direct cost savings result from reduction in track maintenance costs;
reduction in repair and maintenance costs of traction and rolling stock;
improved utilization of traction and rolling stock through higher aver-
age speed; reduced staff costs; and increased safety.

steam with diesel and increased axle loads on some lines. Details of the eco-
nomic evaluation are in Annex 8. For some Part B investments (e.g., elec-
trification and new lines), the economic rates of return are based on optimis-
tic assumptions and will be reviewed before those investments are implemented.
The Yugoslav railways have on the above basis estimated the economic rate of
return for the Investment Plan as a whole at 15%, which is realistic.
6.12      There are no significant differences in type and priority of invest-
ments undertaken during the Plan (1976-80) and the Project (1978-80) periods
(the latter comprising a three-year slice of the total Plan investments, para
4.07). The composition of investments will not vary significantly over the
Plan period, although Part B investments represent a slightly larger share of
the Project (19%) than the Plan (15%). Part B investments generally yield a
lower economic rate of return than Part A investments. No investments in 1976
could be defined as Part B investments because they had already been under-
taken at the time of appraisal, and the same applied to some extent also to
1977. Had agreement on dividing the Plan into Parts A and B been reached in
1975, the Plan would have included the same share of Part B investments as the
Project. The Project investments have been estimated to yield on average the
same economic rate of return as the Plan, 15%. This return may actually turn
out to be even higher, as some of Part B investments are likely to be post-
poned to after 1980. In this respect the procedures for transferring invest-
ments from Part B to Part A (para. 4.06) will be important.
6.13      The economic rate of return is most sensitive to changes in traffic
growth and to increases in costs. A 20% reduction in the expected traffic
growth and a corresponding increase in investments cost would, with an un-
changed investment program, reduce the estimated economic rate of return from
15% to about 11%. A similar result would be obtained with unchanged costs but
with a 50% reduction in the estimated traffic growth. However, the risk that
the economic rate of return would experience such a drop is small. First,
there is no evidence that traffic forecasts are optimistic. On the contrary,
the 1977 traffic development (para. 6.04) is substantially above the forecast
growth rate. Second, the investment plan is under constant review through the
rolling system of planning and it will be adjusted to meet any adverse develop-
ments. The division of the Plan into Parts A and B is part of this planning
system and has been designed to reduce the risk associated with the Project
by postponing Part B investments as necessary. Finally, about 2/3 of the
total investment plan consists of replacements which need to be undertaken,
even without growth of traffic.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Satisfactory assurances and undertakings have been received regard-
ing the issues referred to in the preceding chapters. These provide in par-
ticular for the following:



- 29 -
Financial Position. In accordance with a recent Social Agreement con-
cluded between Government and railway authorities, a number of measures
are being taken to ensure the railways' liquidity, the most important
of which are the provision of incentive-linked compensation payments
(intended to replace general Government subsidies) and tariff increases.
The railways will take all steps in their power (i) to obtain annual
tariff increases sufficient to compensate for inflation during the
previous twelve-month period and (ii) to ensure that the RTEs' financial
results are such that for Yugoslav Railways as a whole tariff revenues
account for not less than 85% of operating revenues in 1980 and sub-
sequent years.
Investment Plans. (i) No material modifications will be made to the
Investment Plans without consultation with the Bank and certain types
of amendments will not be made without the Bank's agreement; and (ii)
Investment Plans will be reviewed at least annually to take into
account traffic results and trends.
Action Plans. The railways will implement and update regularly com-
prehensive Action Plans, including manpower plans which shall cover
staffing requirements and surplus staff, and Operational Plans which
shall cover the procurement and utilization of the main assets.
7.02      On these bases, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$100
million for a period of 15 years including three years of grace, at the
standard Bank interest rate.

APPRAISAL OF
A FIFTH RAILWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Study of Road User Charges
Background
1.        In many countries, as well as in Yugoslavia, certain charges for
road transport may be below cost. In particular, it is believed that road
transport by diesel trucks may pay less than its fair share of infrastructure
costs. Meanwhile, reduced traffic and restrictions upon tariffs have caused
railway operating deficits and suggestions have been put forward for a public
contribution towards infrastructure costs.
2.        In Yugoslavia the total revenue from taxes on gasoline and oil,
license fees, as well as the revenue from taxes paid by foreign motor vehi-
cles entering Yugoslavia, yielded about Dn 6.0 billion (US$0.33 billion) in
1974 compared to a total outlay of about Dn 5.6 billion (US$0.31 billion) on
the construction and maintenance of all interurban highways. But even where
they may cover overall costs, there may not be a direct relation between
specific user charges on different types of vehicles especially heavy trucks
and the infrastructure costs for which they are accountable. These practices
may lead to distortions in traffic flows within and between different trans-
port modes. The Bank has no evidence that road users as a whole do not pay
their full road infrastructure costs in Yugoslavia, but cross subsidies may
favor heavy diesel trucks which inflict the most damage on the roads, because
diesel carries less tax than gasoline. To clarify this situation with respect
to road transport in Yugoslavia, the Eighth Highway Project includes, as an
important component, a study on road user charges.
Purpose of the Study
3.        The purpose of the study is to examine the fiscal, economic and
administrative aspects of the present system of levying road user charges,
taxing vehicles and allocating resources to the highway sector in Yugoslavia.
After reviewing the existing situation and taking into account Yugoslavia's
position with respect to the European Economic Community, the study will make
recommendations concerning appropriate pricing policies and systems for levy-
ing road user charges to achieve an optimal economic utilization of present
and proposed road (including urban road) facilities. The study will also
ascertain the present distribution of revenues from each and all types of
road user charges among the recipient authorities, and the effects of any
recommended changes in road user charges on such revenues, the cost of
transport and the prices of typical commodities.

Scope of the Study
4.        The study will set out first the existing structure and level of
present road user charges for each major vehicle type and recommend the user
charges which should be levied on each of the selected vehicle types, operat-
ing on the interurban as well as the principal urban networks. The study
will consider alternative road pricing policies setting out the advantages
and disadvantages of each.

YUGOSLAVIA
Study of Rail Costs
Background
1.        Each BOAL is responsible for its own accounting and cost recording.
While a considerable amount of detailed cost information may already exist in
individual BOALs, a main task in the introduction of a costing system for the
RTEs would be in codifying and extracting this information and in ensuring the
use of standard methodology in data collection, processing and presentation.
Purpose of the Study
2.        The purpose of the study is to establish a cost accounting system
which will make available to railway management the data which is necessary
for the continuing analysis, comparison and control of costs. It will arrange
for the provision of cost information for the fixing of freight rates and
passenger fares and for a comparison of costs with different transport modes.
It will enable the evaluation of net revenue benefits which may be obtained
from operating and technological changes and from capital investments. It
will establish a methodology for the determination of the cost of surplus
staff.
Scope of the Study
3.        The study will be carried out in two phases with assistance as
required from consultants and under the direction of a steering group com-
prising external participants and RTEs' senior management. Phase I will
include a survey of basic cost data already available and of costing methods
in use and will recommend the steps necessary for the determination of the
costs of all railway services broken down by principal commodity flows and
inter-city and commuter passenger services. It will summarize and review the
existing system of rates and fares. It will detail the methodology for the
evaluation of the cost to the railways of the employment of surplus staff.
It will define costing principles and make preliminary recommendations for
Phase II.
4.        Phase II will provide for the refinement and improvement of cost
data resulting from Phase I in order to achieve a comprehensive system for
cost comparison and control. It will make detailed recommendations for the
improvement of dnt- needed for tariff setting. It will analyze the relation-
ship between tariffs and costs and, if appropriate, make recommendations for
different tariff policies and discuss their implications with reference to
government support measures. It will complete a review of uneconomic lines
under existing methodology. Completion of the study is expected by mid-1979.

Previous Projects
A.   General
1.        Total Bank lending to the transport sector has so far amounted to
US$676.4 million, consisting of US$276 million for eight highway projects,
US$108.4 million for two pipeline projects, US$44 million for the Port of
Bar Project and US$248 million for four railway projects. Two of the rail-
way loans financed investments on the main railway line which traverses
Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border, and
the other two helped finance railway links between that line and the ports
of Ploce and Bar. Much of the highway loans went towards the construction of
the Adriatic Highway and towards road improvements in less developed regions
of the country. Only a relatively small part of Bank Highway loans was for
roads parallel to railway lines to which Bank loans had been allocated. The
oil pipeline, which is to be completed in 1979, parallels existing rail routes
for much of its length but will carry imported crude oil only and its effects
have been taken into account in railways' future planning. The Port of Bar
Project complements the railway project linking the main line to the Port.
Highway Projects
2.        The first highway project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) was financed
in 1963 for the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway (422
km) and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road (174 km).  The second highway project
(Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the improvement of
367 km of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via Sarajevo and Tuzla
with the Adriatic highway. Both projects were completed within the original
cost estimates and agreed time schedules. The third (Loan 608-YU, US$30 mil-
lion), financed in 1969, comprised about 120 km of roads in Croatia, Macedonia
and Slovenia, and was completed in August 1974 with a 20-month delay primarily
due to delays in completing an access road, but which did not impede the opera-
tion of the main highway. This project had an 8% cost overrun, because of
inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The fourth (Loan 678-YU, US$40
million) was financed in 1970 for the construction of about 220 km of roads
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Vojvodina. Because of
expropriation problems in the section of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the project was
completed in December 1975 with 18 months delay. There was a 12% cost overrun
due to inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The fifth highway project
(Loan 751-YU, US$35 million) became effective 8 months late in June 1972, due
to Government administrative delays. The project comprised 153 km of roads
in Kosovo, Macedonia and Slovenia together with procurement of engineering

equipment and a staff training component. All roads are open for traffic, and
project completion is expected in mid-1977. An 8% cost overrun is estimated
because of the combined effect of inflation and foreign exchange adjustments.
The loan for the sixth highway project (Loan 990-YU, US$30 million) was made
in May 1974 and became effective six weeks later than estimated in December
1974. The project finances six road sections in Bosnia-Herzegovina, totalling
150 km, the training of transportation economists and road engineers and US$1.1
million worth of engineering and laboratory equipment. The loan for the
seventh highway project (Loan 1143-YU, US$40 million) was made in July 1975
and became effective in March 1976. The project comprises about 90 km of road
construction in Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro, and US$0.1 million worth of
technical assistance to improve preparation of highway feasibility studies
and to provide a related training program. Construction works for all seven
projects have been or are being satisfactorily carried out. A loan of US$56
million for an eighth highway project (Loan 1377-YU) was signed in April 1977.
The project is for the construction of 28 km of roads in Serbia, 53 km in
Macedonia, 40 km in Kosovo and 9 km in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and contains pro-
vision for a road user charges study and a railway costing study.
Naftagas and Oil Pipeline Projects
3.        The loan for the Naftagas Project (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million) was
made in June 1973, but, due to organizational reforms within the enterprise,
became effective only in March 1974 after six months' delay. The project is
for the expansion of the gas transmission and distribution systems in Serbia
and Vojvodina by provision of gas field compressors, pipelines, treatment
plants and distribution rings. The supply of natural gas will come from gas
fields in Vojvodina and from Hungarian imports. Due to a substantial increase
in the project costs and a reallocation of priorities in the use of natural
gas, which caused the elimination of some consumers who withdrew their finances
from the project, a delay of more than two years in project implementation has
occurred. It has been decided that the implementation will be carried out in
three phases and only the first two will be implemented now. The additional
funds required will be provided by agencies in Yugoslavia and by a supple-
mentary loan of US$11 million from the Bank under the Sarajevo Air Pollution
Control Project - Loan 1264-YU. Construction started in late June 1976 and
the project is scheduled for completion by year end 1978. This pipeline
project does not compete in the transport field with other transport modes.
The loan for the Oil Pipeline Project (Loan 1173-YU, US$49.0 million) was made
in November 1975 and became effective in July 1976 after four months' delay.
The project comprises the construction of an oil port on the Adriatic coast
at Omisalj, near Rijeka, as well as oil storage tank farms, pumping stations,
and pipelines running from the port through Croatia and Vojvodina and to the
Hungarian border. Phase I is to provide a yearly capacity of 16 million tons
and Phase II, 20 million. The international transit portion of Phase I,
which is to provide oil to Hungary and Czechoslovakia, should be completed
on schedule in 1978 but the domestic portion, due to problems of design and
procurement, will be completed a year later. Phase II should be completed on
schedule by May 1979.

Port of Bar Project
4.        A loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in November 1974 to
finance a port project complementary to the railway project for the Belgrade/
Bar line. This loan was to finance both port and railway facilities in Bar
and became effective in June 1975. The project is now about nine months
behind schedule due to delays on procurement of grain silos and retendering
and negotiations with the lowest bidder for the main items of civil works.
Railways
5.        The first railway loan was made in 1963 (Loan 316-YU, US$35 million)
to finance the conversion of the 195 km Sarajevo-Ploce line to standard gauge,
with electric traction and modern signaling and telecommunications. The
project was substantially completed and put into operation in 1970, with a
delay of four years.
6.        The second railway loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million) was made in
1964 to help finance the modernization of 1509 km of main lines traversing
Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to the Greek border. It
includes electrification, signaling, telecommunications, and six key marshal-
ing yards. This project ran into major difficulties because after the 1965
political and economic reforms the railways' internal funds fell substan-
tially below expectations, but also because of deficiencies in project plan-
ning and preparation which resulted in an underestimate of quantities and of
time needed for completion of such an extensive project. With hindsight,
this was much too ambitious a project in relation to the railways' resources.
The Bank loan was fully disbursed in 1972; the project has been refinanced
from the fourth railway loan (para. 8 of this Annex) and is expected to be
virtually complete in 1978, ten years after the original completion date, at
a total cost of about US$410 million, over twice the original cost estimate
in US dollar terms.
7.        The third railway loan made in 1968 (Loan 531-YU, US$50 million)
helped to finance construction of 370 km of the Belgrade-Bar line, with elec-
trification, signaling and telecommunications for the entire 475-km line.
This is a project of great technical complexity involving the construction of
over 300 tunnels and several major bridges; these civil works were undertaken
satisfactorily by local contractors. Completion was originally scheduled for
1973 but geotechnical and other construction difficulties delayed the opening
of the line till 1976, and project completion is expected at the end of this
year. Technical problems and inflation aggravated by delays have nearly
doubled the estimated cost of the project in US dollar terms to US$422 million.
8.        Because of problems on the second project, the Bank, in agreement
with the Yugoslav authorities, undertook a comprehensive study of the railways
with the assistance of consultants. This prepared the ground for the fourth
project (Loan 1026-YU, US$93 million), agreed in 1974, under which the Bank's
loan was allocated to the completion of the 1964 Modernization Program and to
"Related Investments" needed to maximize its benefits, all to be completed by
the end of 1976. However, in contrast with earlier projects which consisted



- 36 -
ANNEX 3
Page 4
only of investments to which the Bank loan had been allocated, the fourth
project was defined as the totality of the railway-'  mnlTestmens iTr 197A-l76,
whose cost was estimated at US$1138 million; the Bank loan thus amounted to
about 12% of project cost. Agreement was reached on measures to resolve the
railways' financial problems, principally by tariff increases. An important
feature of the project was the preparation of comprehensive Action Plans
which, given Yugoslavia's decentralized system, were designed to contribute
to a common understanding of objectives and responsibility by all concerned.
9.        In the event, tariff increases were limited as part of the Govern-
ment's anti-inflationary measures, as explained in para 5.04 of the main text.
This limited investment funds and the impact on the execution of investments
was compounded by other anti-inflationary measures aimed at reducing the
rate of investment throughout the economy. Only about two-thirds of project
investments were executed by the end of 1976; however, they were reasonably
balanced to maximize system effects, and the remainder have been included in
the 1976-80 Investment Plan. Execution of Bank-financed "Related Investments"
was substantially better (about three quarters), and the electrification of
the main line traversing Yugoslavia from the Austrian and Italian borders to
the Greek border was completed under the 1964 Modernization Program. However,
long-standing problems on that Program, especially with a contractor over
whom the railways have little control, were not fully resolved, and therefore
the rate of execution of items on which the Bank loan is being disbursed was,
on average, the same as for the project as a whole; it is now expected that
these items will be virtually completed by the end of 1978. Despite these
delays, project execution has been substantially better than on the second
project. In particular, large quantity increases, which were features of
the second project, have been eliminated.
10.       As part of the Action Plans, the railways set certain targets for
staff productivity and utilization of traction and rolling stock. Performance
on those targets has been mixed; in general, targets for locomotive avail-
ability and utilization of freight and passenger cars have been attained
except that there is some delay in reaching the target for turnaround time.
In general, the targets for locomotive utilization (km/day) have not been
reached. Difficulties in reaching targets were due in part to the downturn
of the economy and the decrease in traffic, in 1975 and 1976 (main text,
para. 3.24). However, these performance indicators constituted only part
of the Action Plans, which addressed all the RTEs' functions. These plans
contributed substantially to sensitizing the railway staff to market pres-
sures, and to improving planning processes, especially for investment.
Operational Plans have been drawn up for every major asset, such as electric
locomotives, track superstructure and integral transport, to optimize procure-
ment and utilization including the rate of replacement. These Operational
Plans, together with feasibility studies financed from the fourth loan, played
a key part in shaping the 1976-80 Investment Plans.

Communities of Interest
1.        In Slovenia the COI for rail transport and ports 1/ was formed in
1975 and has been responsible for economic and organizational policy and for
payments of compensation to railways since that time. The COI is organized
in separate sections for ports and railways. Membership extends to 2,800
economic organizations of which 800 are categorized as major railway users
and spend at least Dn 10,000 (US$550) yearly on railway services; they are
estimated to provide some 90% of the railways' compensation payment while
the remaining 10% is provided by the other COI members. The amount of com-
pensation paid to the railways is calculated as a portion of the costs of
their infrastructure under detailed rules as to what expenses qualify for
inclusion in the calculation. The COI in this Republic is now soundly
established and plans are proceeding for the establishment of regional COIs
which will deal with matters specific to their areas. One of these is un-
economic lines where the task of finding means to increase profitability will
be allocated to the regional COIs. If this proves impossible then the alter-
natives will be to close the line or for the regional COI to reimburse the
loss.
2.        In Croatia, after a slow start and a threat of Government action,
a COI for rail transport was formed in 1976 and a Social Agreement, which
lays down detailed criteria for the payment to the RTE of a traffic-related
contribution was signed in May 1977 by the Executive Council, the COI, the
RTE, the Chamber of Economy and the Transport Trade Union. The amount of the
contribution is expressed as a sum per traffic unit and has been calculated
from estimates of revenue and expense to enable the RTE to cover its operating
expenses and debt interest at planned traffic levels. The formula for payment
includes provision for financial penalties linked to various easily monitored
operational efficiency indicators but the payments in any case provide a
strong incentive to the RTE to achieve or exceed its planned traffic levels.
The planned traffic levels on which the calculations are based are contained
in an Operational Plan covering services, finance and development, and includ-
ing also staff levels and wages and salaries, which is submitted by the RTE
to the COI for its approval before the beginning of each year. Payments are
to be made monthly to the RTE. The funds for payment of the contributions
to the RTE are raised by a levy on the net income of the economic organiza-
tions forming the COI which includes economic enterprises. Funds for develop-
ment are raised in the same way.
1/   In practice, Koper is the only significant port.

3.        In Bosnia-Herzegovina the COI for rail transport is more recently
established and consists at present of 34 economic enterprises, which are
major railway users and responsible for some 80% of all railway traffic, and
eight municipalities. 1/ The Republican Government, which in the past has
been responsible for reimbursement of the RTE's deficit, is retaining respon-
sibility for specific subsidies for uneconomic lines and for wages of staff
made redundant by line closures but other payments to the RTE may come from
the COI. Consideration is currently being given in the COI as to methods of
raising funds for, and calculation of, compensation. The COI recognizes that
a major cause of the railways' losses is uneconomic lines. Closures of many
narrow-gauge lines have already taken place and closure of the remaining 200
km of narrow-gauge lines is planned in the next two years. A further initia-
tive taken by the COI has been in connection with passenger trains which do
not recover their costs. Discussions were held with Chambers of Economy and
Municipalities regarding some 160 trains which were in, or bordered upon, this
category. As a result, decisions were taken for the withdrawal of 40 trains
while 106 were allowed a further period after which their position will again
be reviewed. A further concern of the COI in Bosnia-Herzegovina is with sur-
plus staff in the RTE. As a result of the closure of lines over past years
and of a lack of opportunities for alternative employment, staff levels are
generally higher than in any other RTE. Partly due to the COI's intervention,
the Government is already paying the salaries of 2,000 men categorized as
redundant from this cause while others have received early retirement. The COI
is taking a lead through Chambers of Economy and with the banks in endeavoring
to provide funds and to direct construction of new factories to those areas
where they will have most impact upon this problem.
4.        In Vojvodina, where the COI was formed in December 1976, 600 out of
2,500 economic organizations are members but these include all major rail
users. The principal activities of the COI so far have been related to the
railways' investment proposals and operational schedules but the SAE has now
brought a new emphasis to economic and financial considerations. A joint com-
mittee consisting of members of the Executive Council, the COI and the Chamber
of Economy is currently considering proposals for payment and funding of com-
pensation and early decisions are expected. The Government has also requested
early proposals for action on uneconomic lines which are a major problem in
Vojvodina.
5.        In Macedonia, the  OI was formed in October 1977 and comprises
almost all economic organizations in the Republic. A decision has already
been taken that funds for compensation for the railways in 1978 are to be
raised by a levy on the incomes 2/ of members and a steering group is cur-
rently engaged in planning further actions.
6.        Arrangements for the formation of COIs are proceeding in Serbia,
Montenegro and Kosovo.
1/   Up to 87 municipalities may join the COI if they wish.
2/   Income is revenue less operating expenses, except for wages, and before
charging interest or taxes.

Action Plans and Operational Plans
1.        The purpose and scope of Action Plans have been discussed in paras
4.19 and 4.20 of the main text. CYR and the RTEs have undertaken to update
and implement their Action Plans under suitable monitoring systems. The
Action Plans will include:
(a) Measures needed to attain financial targets (paras 5.05, 5.06,
5.08, 5.11 and Annex 6);
(b) Manpower plans covering future staffing requirements and
probable recruitment sources; plans for retraining, transfer-.
ring and retiring surplus staff; and plans for attaining
staffing and productivity targets (para 3.14);
(c) A timetable for studying and taking appropriate follow-up
action on uneconomic lines and services (paras 3.26, 3.27);
(d) Development of CYR's functions, notably in connection with
(a) technical/economic analyses, (b) the application of the
results of the railway costing and road user charge studies,
(c) assisting the RTEs in connection with Action Plans and
Investment Plans (paras 3.04, 4.17);
(e) Execution of a study of electric locomotive maintenance
(para 3.19).
Operational Plans
2.        As part of their Action Plans, the RTEs have prepared Operational
Plans, which they have also undertaken to update and implement, in collabora-
tion with CYR. In particular, they have agreed to elaborate the Operational
Plans for signaling and telecommunications (para 4.20). Assurances have been
received that Operational Plans will include:
(a) A plan for traction, rolling stock and related workshops,
including operational targets (para 3.20 and Table 12).
Examples of calculations made for determining locomotive
and car requirements are given below;
(b) A plan for the capital overhaul of track;

(c) A signaling plan;
(d) A telecommunications plan;
(e) A data processing plan;
(f) A plan for integral transport.
Traction and Rolling Stock
3.        The analyses contained in Operational Plans will be illustrated by
examples relating to traction and rolling stock. In these examples, the
analysis is based on forecasts of traffic and vehicle utilization; the latter
is derived from past performance, amended to take into account increased
operational efficiency and changes in the quality of service. The procedure
used for locomotives is illustrated by the table below, which relates to RTE
Zagreb's electric locomotives. Gross ton km for passenger and freight traffic
are obtained from the RTE's traffic forecasts and entered in the table. The
RTE's estimates of average train weights, which are satisfatory, are entered
next. Train km are then obtained by dividing gross ton km by train weight.
Km per day per locomotive in service are obtained from RTE estimates, which
are again satisfactory and will be seen to increase from year to year. The
number of locomotives needed for train service is obtained by dividing train
km by the km per day per locomotive in service.

4.        The availability of locomotives and their utilization is obtained
from RTE estimates.  Availability depends on the age and quality of the fleet
and on maintenance facilities and procedures. Utilization depends on schedul-
ing constraints and seasonal and other traffic variations. Availability and
utilization are both satisfactory, and increasing. Dividing the number of
locomotives needed for train service by their availability, and again by their
utilization, gives the number of locomotives needed operationally.
5.        The number of locomotives on order is entered next in the table.
Finally, the total number of electric locomotives in the RTE's fleet in 1976
is entered in the last line. As all these locomotives are relatively new,
none are due to be scrapped, and the size of the fleet will vary only because
of new deliveries. The fleet in 1977-80 is calculated on that basis.
6.        It will be seen that the RTE will be short of one electric locomo-
tive in 1978 and 1979, but additional procurement does not appear justified
because, as a result of improved utilization, availability and km/day, there
will be sufficient locomotives in 1980. The shortage in 1978-9 could be made
up by improved utilization, somewhat greater use of diesel traction, or greater
use of other RTEs' locomotives.



- 42 -
ANNEX 5
Page 4
7.        The procedure used for rolling stock is illustrated by the table
below, which relates to RTE Skopje's freight cars. The first line gives the
traffic; the second, the average load per car, which is expected to improve
yearly; their quotient is the number of carloads per year (line 3). This and
the forecast turnaround time (line 4) gives the number of cars needed in
traffic (line 5). Car availability and utilization are then forecast (lines 6
and 7), based respectively on maintenance requirements and on the seasonal and
other variations in traffic demand during the year. This leads to the total
cars needed (line 8). Cars available in the base year (1976) are entered in
line 9, while cars to be scrapped and cars delivered or on order are entered
for all years in lines 10 and 11. From these data the cars in the fleet on
January 1 are calculated for 1977 and subsequent years. Line 12 shows that
during 1976-78 cars available on January 1 exceed the year's requirements, but
by less than the number of cars to be scrapped during the year. By the end of
the Plan period the fleet would match the projected car requirements to within
1%. It will be seen that these requirements increase less than the traffic,
because of better car utilization; ton-km per ton of capacity increase from
6500 in 1976 to 9000 in 1980 (Table 12).

At this stage, before the formation of COIs in most of its region, RTE
Belgrade has made the assumption that non-tariff contributions will be suffi-
cient only to increase operating revenue to the level of operating expenses
plus loan interest. The forecast marked improvements in the ratios for
Sarajevo and Skopje reflect the larger traffic growth predictions for those
two RTEs. An undertaking was received that best efforts would be used for
cost savings to attain target ratios as shown below:
1978     1979      1980
Belgrade                             97        97        97

3.        Forecast Rates of Return on Average Net Fixed Assets in Use are
shown below:

The largest forecast improvements are again from those RTEs anticipating
biggest traffic growth.  The following rates of return were agreed as targets
for the years 1978-1980:
1978     1979      1980
Belgrade                             1.3       1.1      1.3

Debt service coverage improved in 1976 despite a 10% increase in the debt ser-
vice total and further improvements are forecast. Undertakings were received
that RTEs will not incur debt to an extent where it might materially and
adversely affect their ability to carry out their obligations under the loan,
and the following debt limitation ratios 1/ were agreed:
RTE                            1978         1979       1980

Debt/Equity ratios have been generally low reflecting minimum borrowings and
equity values which have been increased by asset revaluations. Ratios rise
throughout the project period to maximum figures of 35/65 in Belgrade and
1/   Current gross internal resources divided by maximum future debt service.

A shortage of working capital has been a problem for all of the RTEs in recent
years and has been responsible for difficulty in sustaining capital expendi-
ture levels. Compensation payments to be made currently should change this
picture. A good improvement in cash and other working capital balances is
forecast and the figures are generally satisfactory. Agreement was reached
that each RTE will use its best efforts to achieve targets as shown below for
cash balances and other working capital as a proportion of cash operating
expenses. The high level of outstanding creditors reflects mainly amounts
owing for services by associated BOALs. Current legislation designed to speed
payment of accounts should ensure a considerable reduction of both debtors
and creditors and should improve both current and liquid ratios.

Main Assumptions Used in Financial Evaluation
The financial forecasts are based on the following principal assump-
tions:
Traffic
1.        Freight and passenger traffic forecasts prepared by each RTE and
summarized for CYR in Table 14.
Operating Expenses
2.        Wage rate increases based on a forecast of inflation of 10% per year
from 1976 onwards which, together with real adjustments which vary from one
RTE to another to match the expected levels for comparable sectors of the
economy in the republics concerned, average 11.8% per annum over the period.
3.        Fuel and electricity costs and other working expenses which are
estimated to rise by about 10% per year.
4.        Reductions in staff during the period (with the exception of RTE
Ljubljana) stemming from reorganization and the effects of the investment
program which will be slower than efficiency alone would dictate because of
government restrictions on the discharge of surplus staff.
5.        Depreciation charges according to rates published in SFRY Official
Gazette No. 58 of December 31, 1976 and SFRY Official Gazette No. 5 of January
21, 1977 together with fixed asset values calculated according to the law of
October 1975 requiring an annual revaluation of those assets for which rele-
vant indices have increased by 10% over original cost of previous valuation..
6.        Specific payments for losses on uneconomic lines in RTEs Sarajevo
and Ljubljana only, although payments to be received from COIs and Government
sources by other RTEs may include an element for the cost of uneconomic lines.
Revenue
7.        Revenue from traffic carried at domestic rates:
(i) For 1977 increased by 8.5% from April 30, 1977 for both
passengers and freight in all RTEs.



- 49 -
ANNEX 7
Page 2
(ii)  For each remaining year of the investment program, increased
by 10% to meet estimated inflation from the beginning of the
calendar year.
8.        Revenue from traffic carried at international transit rates cal-
culated at those rates operative in April 1977 plus estimates of subsequent
increases during the investment plan period.
9.        Payment of compensation and specific subsidies during the year to
which they relate.
Exchange Rate
10.       Foreign exchange rate of US$1.00 to Dn. 18.00.
Debt Service
11.       The proposed IBRD loan with an interest rate of 8% per annum and
repayable over 15 years including three years of grace. All other proposed
borrowings from domestic and foreign sources at terms consistent with Yugoslav
and RTEs' experience and according to debt service summaries prepared by each
RTE.

Economic Analysis
A.   Capital Overhaul and Reconstruction of Lines and Stations
1.        At 1977 prices these investments excluding contingencies amount to
(para. 4.04):
Dn           US$
Billion      Million
Capital overhaul of track                       8.24          458
Reconstruction of lines and stations            6.43          357
Total                                   14.67          815
This accounts for 36% of total investments.
2.         The economic effects of overhaul and reconstruction are similar,
the differences consisting only in the degree of improvement. Track overhaul
normally includes replacement of rails, track fastenings and sleepers, bal-
lasting and minor substructure improvements. Reconstruction involves major
realignments, changes of station layouts to improve capacity, and reconstruc-
tion of station facilities. The Bank loan would be disbursed against high
priority capital overhaul works (para. 4.12), and the railways have calculated
the economic rate of return (ERR) for each of about 60 lines to be overhauled
as part of their Operational Plan for Capital Overhaul. In addition, fea-
sibility studies have been made or are in progress for major reconstruction
works.
3.        The benefits of track improvements are:
(i) reduction in track maintenance costs;
(ii) decrease of wear and hence of maintenance costs of locomotives
and rolling stock;
(iii)  speed increases, which decrease the staff, locomotives and
rolling stock needed for a given traffic;
(iv) in some cases, increased permissible axle loads, which in turn
result in:



-51 -                         ANNEX 8
Page 2
(a) introduction of high-capacity modern cars, which
lower freight costs;
(b) reduction in locomotive operating costs;
(c) in some cases, displacement of steam locomotives
by diesel locomoLives, which lowers traction costs;
(v) increased safety (fewer derailments).
4.        The railways have included ia their calculation only benefits (i) to
(iii). The other benefits were not included although (iv)(c) is of consider-
able importance for some lines; it was excluded, as was (v), because little
empirical information was available and calculations were complex.
5.        Furthermore, the railways' analysis was essentially "before-and-
after", rather than "with-and-without", in that it largely ignored future
cost increases which would occur in the absence of capital overhaul. These
increases would arise because continued deterioration of the track would in-
crease maintenance costs for the track, locomotives and rolling stock, while
increasingly extensive speed restrictions would decrease utilization of staff
and assets, and limit line capacity. However, the railways took into account
future cost increases for track maintenance, but otherwise compared the situa-
tions before and after overhaul, thus calculating conservative ERRs.
6.        These ERRs ranged from 10.4% to 20.0%, averaging about 14%; for
lines exceeding about 10 million gross tons, they exceeded 16%. During the
appraisal, a re-evaluation was undertaken in order to assess the extent to
which ERRs have been underestimated. Table I to this Annex gives details of
the evaluation for the Kosovo Polje-Pec line (RTO Pristina) which had the
lowest ERR (10%) calculated by the railways. The evaluation showed that:
(i) If the only benefits taken into account are savings in maintenance
of track, locomotives and rolling stock and (direct) effects of
speed increases, the ERR was 10%, confirming the railway's cal-
culations;
(ii) If account was taken also of the replacement of steam with
diesel, and heavier trains (and rescheduling of freight train
operations), the ERR increased to about 17%;
(iii) If all benefits are taken into account, but it is assumed that
the line is already operated by diesel traction (as most lines
to be overhauled are), the ERR is about 12%.
7.        These results are typical.  For most track overhaul projects, the
ERR calculated by the railways was underestimated by about 20% (e.g., it
should have been 18% instead of 15%). In a few cases, as for the above line,
track overhaul makes possible major improvements in traction and operations

and even greater correction of ERR is required. Summarizing, while the aver-
age ERR calculated by the railways was 14%, an ERR of about 17% would more
closely reflect the actual cost reductions (benefits).
B.   Signaling and Telecommunications (S&T)
8.        Investments for the modernization of S&T amount to Dn 5.83 billion
(US$324 million) at 1977 prices, excluding contingencies (para. 4.04), and
represent about 15% of the total Investment Plan. Typically, they are sub-
divided as follows: 60% for signaling, 27% for telecommunications and 13% for
the common cable.
9.        The principal effects of modernizing signaling are:
(i) Staff decreases, resulting from the introduction of automation
and centralization of the signaling functions;
(ii) Increased safety, which is the prime objective of signaling,
which can be quantified as a decrease in accident costs;
(iii) Increased train speeds, resulting from the more rapid execu-
tion of signaling actions; this increases staff productivity,
utilization of traction and rolling stock, and line capacity;
(iv) Increased line capacity due to the ability to operate trains
closer to each other; this can be very important on double
track lines, but affects single line operations only if suc-
cessive trains are dispatched in the same direction instead
of in opposite directions;
(v) Changes, usually increases, in S&T maintenance costs.
10.       Modernization of telecommunications (T) is necessary because exist-
ing equipment is obsolete and inadequate for the efficient operations of the
railways. However, while T investments increase staff productivity and the
utilization of the railways' assets, they are very difficult to quantify,
especially on a line-by-line basis. These benefits have therefore been
generally understated or even ignored in these studies.
11.       The economic evaluation of a major S&T investment project is sum-
marized below at 1975 prices. It relates to the 182 km Doboj-Bosanski Novi
line in RTE Sarajevo.
12.       The investment cost is estimated at Dn 437 million (US$42.3 million).
In 1974 the line carried about 1.8 million net tons and about 2.5 million
passengers, resulting in about 325 million net ton-km and 450 million pass-km,
and a tQtal of approximately 8.5 million gross tons and 1.5 billion gross
ton-km. Most of the freight traffic is heavy bulk (raw materials for steel
industry). Traffic increases have been estimated, conservatively, at 3% p.a.
for freight, and 0.8% p.a. for passengers.

ANNEX 8
Page 4
13.       The railways have estimated that the S&T investments will have the
following effects:
(i)  there will be fewer slowdowns and stops on line and reduced
time spent in stations so that average variable train operating
costs (locomotives, rolling stock) will be reduced:
-    from Dn 47.43 to Dn 45.62 per 1000 GTKM for freight trains, and
-    from Dn 90.12 to Dn 86.68 per 1000 GTKM for passenger trains;
(ii)  line capacity will increase by about 22% due to the higher
average train speeds and reduced time spent in stations. A
capacity increase corresponding to 1.95 million gross tons
(equivalent to 1.3 million net tons) will be necessary by 1980
and, for freight, the additional traffic can be carried at a
marginal cost of Dn 8.6 per 1000 GTKM (train operating + line
maintenance costs). In the absence of improved S&T the cost
for carrying the additional traffic is assumed, conservatively,
to equal the average cost of existing traffic, and on that basis
S&T investments yield a cost saving of Dn 38.8 per 1000 GTKM;
(iii) Station personnel will gradually be reduced by 175 employes for
the whole line, resulting ultimately in an annual saving of about
7.65 million per year at 1975 prices;
(iv) annual maintenance costs of S&T equipment will increase by Dn 4.7
million;
(v) benefits from increased safety have been estimated conservatively,
on the basis of reductions in accidents, at about Dn 1.3 million
in 1980.
14.       Cost and benefits streams are given in Table 2 to this Annex.  The
economic rate of return, 18.0%, is typical for other S&T investments, which
vary from a low 10% (cutoff level) to about 30%. The average rate of return
may be estimated at about 18-20%. The main reason for these fairly high
returns is that by undertaking S&T investments, line capacity can be increased
considerably and much costlier investments in civil works can be postponed.
C.   Electrification
15.       Investments in railway electrification amount to Dn 1.6 billion
(US$88 million) at 1977 prices excluding contingencies, 5% of the 1976-80
investment program. Most of the main lines in Yugoslavia are electrified so
that the lines remaining to be electrified tend to have rates of return close
to 10%, but some yield returns of about 20%, with an average of about 12%.
Electrification usually has the following advantages:

ANNEX 8
Page 5
13.       The railways have estimated that the S&T investments will have the
following effects:
(i) Energy costs are reduced. This depends on the relative prices
of diesel fuel and electrical energy, as energy consumption is
roughly the same for diesel and for electric traction. In
Yugoslavia changing from diesel to electric traction may de-
crease energy costs used in economic analysis typically by
about half (including internal railway handling costs for
diesel fuel, taken as 10%);
(ii) Traction maintenance costs are decreased. In most countries,
maintenance costs for electric locomotives are about one third
to one half diesel maintenance costs. Maintenance costs of
fixed installation must be added to those of electric loco-
motives, but even so diesel traction costs are substantially
higher, perhaps 1.4 to 2.0 times as high. In Yugoslavia,
however, there is little difference between maintenance costs
with the two types of traction. This may be due to technical
problems resulting from design deficiencies of some electric
locomotives, but a study is needed to establish whether any
improvements of maintenance procedures are needed;
(iii) Average speed is increased. This results from the overload
capacity of electric traction, which can give higher speeds
on gradients and greater acceleration. Higher speeds increase
staff productivity, utilization of traction and rolling stock
and track capacity, but capacity increase is unlikely to
exceed 15-20% compared to what can be achieved with diesel
traction.
16.       The calculation of the ERR for the electrification of the 41 km
Sunja-Bosanski Novi line (RTE Zagreb) is discussed below to illustrate the
analysis undertaken by consultants (Sofrerail, France) for electrification
projects. This is a single track on the route between the port and indus-
trial center of Split, and Zagreb and ,other parts of the main railway network.
The topography is well suited for electrification because it includes rela-
tively high gradients (up to 1.5%). In 1980, when electrification is in-
tended to be completed, the forecast traffic is 15 million gross tons.
1974 traffic was 11.5 million gross tons (1/3 passengers, 2/3 freight),
carried with both steam and diesel traction; the line is approaching full
capacity utilization under present operating practices. 1/ Electrification
1/   For this analysis, the alternative to electrification was taken as a
continuation of mixed traction, although with an increased number of
diesels. In a separate analysis, it was assumed that diesel traction
would be enhanced to the extent needed to eliminate steam, and compared
to this situation the ERR for electrification was about 15%.

ANNEX 8
Page 6
would postpone the need for double tracking to the 1990s. The consultants
assumed freight traffic to increase by about 8% p.a. during the next few years
and by about 3-4% after 1980. This forecast is optimistic for the 1976-80
period and has been revised to correspond to the lower 3-4% annual growth
rates. The economic effects of the electrification investment have on this
basis been established as follows, using 1975 prices.
17.       The cost of fixed installations, including civil engineering works
required to increase clearances and protection of S&T facilities, is estimated
at Dn 71.9 million. In addition locomotive procurement by 1980 would account
for Dn 75.5 million, as compared with Dn 43.2 million if the present mixed
traction operations continued. In the latter case there would be an additional
cost of Dn 75.6 million in 1990 to replace the existing steam and diesel loco-
motives with new diesels. The investment cost stream has been summarized in
Table 3 to this Annex.
Savings in Traction Energy
18.       For this line cost of energy with mixed traction has been estimated
at Dn 23.1 per 1000 GTKM; the economic cost of electric energy has been cal-
culated at Dn 9.5 per 1000 GTKM. With a 1980 traffic volume of about 600
million GTKM (15 million gross tons) for existing mixed traction and 540 mil-
lion GTKM for electric traction 1/, the savings in traction energy cost would
amount to Dn 8.7 million (Table 3). The present traction costs are high, not
only because of mixed traction, but because of difficult topography.
Savings in Train Crews
19.       These have been calculated on the basis of number of trains-km and
average crew costs. For the present mixed traction, the crew costs are esti-
mated to be Dn 9.2 per train-km; for electric traction these costs would be
reduced to Dn 7.0 per train-km. With about 840,000 train-km for mixed and
665,000 train-km for electric traction in 1980 these savings would amount to
about Dn 3.08 million in 1980 (Table 3).
Traction Maintenance
20.       Traction maintenance costs have been estimated at Dn 3.6 and Dn 3.32
train-km for mixed and electric traction respectively. The savings in loco-
motive maintenance would amount to Dn 0.81 million in 1980 (Table 3). This is
an unusual result, as discussed in para. 14. It is to be hoped that improved
maintenance procedures for electric locomotives will decrease costs; this
would improve the ERR for all Yugoslav electrification projects.
Savings from Increased Capacity
21.       Electrification will result in higher average train speeds and net
payloads per freight trains. As a result, an unchanged volume of traffic can
1/   Net traffic is the same in both cases.



-56 -                          ANNEX 8
Page 7
be carried by fewer train-km (a saving of about 21% on 175,000 train-km in
1980, Table 3) in a reduced time. This will result in a reduced need for
station staff (saving in train crews have already been included) and reduced
cost for rolling stock, while the reduction in gross tonnage may reduce line
maintenance to some extent. In total, these cost reductions (excluding savings
in traction energy and maintenance, and cost of train crews) have been esti-
mated at Dn 23.5 per train-km compared to existing traction, totaling Dn 4.12
million in 1980 (Table 3).
Economic Rate of Return
22.       Total cost savings per 1000 GTKM has been estimated to amount to
Dn 24.9 million as a result of electrification. This would correspond to
about Dn 0.05 per net ton-km on approximately 10% of total costs. The eco-
nomic rate of return has been calculated to be 17.0% (Table 3).
D.   Traction and Rolling Stock
23.       Investments in traction and rolling stock amount to Dn 11.0 billion
(US$609 million) at 1977 prices, 27% of the Investment Plan (para. 4.04).
These investments have been based on comprehensive Operational Plans, and each
RTE has calculated economic rates of return which range from 13% to 35% for
the portion included in Part A. In addition, traction and rolling stock have
been included in the investment packages which have been subject to feasibility
studies. Examples of the analyses contained in Operational Plans are given in
Annex 5, paras 3-7.

costs (calculated for freight only); capacity increase fully utilized by 1985; without  S & T  investments, the alternative would be line doubling which would
be likely to increase average transport costs above the existing level.
