TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Technical Annex to the
Memorandum and Recommendation of the President
A. Project Description
1.    In addition to describing the project components, this section provides details of the reform
program as set out in GOSL's Sector Policy Letter and Action Plan and PERC's Operational Plan
(Attachments I and 2) and describes the institutional framework of the agencies being assisted. It also
elaborates on the project's institutional development and policy objectives and how they will be achieved.
Proiect Obiectives and Components
2.     The proposed project will:
(a)    assist SLTA in its transition to a more independent regulatory Commission and strengthen
its regulatory authority;
(b)    assist SLTA in (i) improving its administrative and technical capabilities to plan and
control the use of radio frequency spectrum, and (ii) establishing a computerized radio
frequency management and monitoring system; and
(c)    facilitate the divestiture of government owned enterprises, including SLT, by strengthening
the technical and administrative capacity of PERC.
3.    The project consists of two components:
(a)   technical assistance for the strengthening of SLTA, including (i) a frequency management
and monitoring system, with hardware, software, expert assistance during the initial years
of operation, and staff training; (ii) consulting services to assist SLTA in selected studies
on sector regulation; and (iii) staff training; and
(b)    assistance to PERC  in financing consultants and financial advisors for specific
transactions and strengthening of the PERC Secretariat (office equipment, training, travel,
etc.).
Relationship Between the Project and Other IDA SuDported TA Activities
4.     Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs) for the Second Telecommunications Project (Credit 2249-
CE)2 were used to assist in drafting the 1991 Telecommunications Act and establishing the regulatory
2 The December 22, 1995 supervision report for the Second Teleconmnunications Project ranked the project as
unsatisfactory regards implementation due to delays in the procurement of local networks. The original
development objectives, however, have largely been achieved satisfactoiily, despite the procurement problems
with local networks. The original project objective was a total of 50,000 lines (33,000 in Colombo and 17,000
outside). Due to lower unit prices than projected for switching equipment, it was agreed to contract about 44,000

framework. T'echnical assistance for SLTA was also provided through the recently closed Industrial
Development Project (IDP III, Credit 1948-CE)3, which helped SLTA build up its regulatory functions
after its creation in 1991.  The assistance to SLTA  under this project would support continued
strengthening of SLTA's regulatory capabilities by establishing an efficient frequency management and
monitoring system, and for its transition into a more independent regulatory Commission.
5.     IDA is supporting the recently established PERC, through the Public Manufacturing Enterprises
Adjustment Credit (Cr. 2185-CE) of 1990 and IDF financing, in designing an overall privatization program
and strategy for various sectors (such as for airlines and utilities). Assistance is being provided through
experienced consultants and privatization professionals to help develop PERC's work program over the
short and medium term. With the help of such consultants, PERC has already drafted the terms of reference
for the Financial Advisor for the privatization of SLT.
Assistance for Institutional DeveloDment
6.      Technical Assistance to SLTA. Consultants will be retained, under procedures satisfactory to
IDA, to assist SLTA in studies of service pricing, network interconnection, quality and conditions of
service, type approval of equipment, technical standards and others (Attachment 3). The findings of this
study will be used to develop GOSL's longer term regulatory policies as well as to establish suitable license
conditions for a privatized SLT. Upon its conversion into a Comrnission, SLTA's management will pass
from one Director General to five Commissioners. This will involve a reorganization of SLTA, for which
assistance will be provided for under the proposed project, but detailed TOR will be prepared only when
the Commissioners and their background and experience are known. SLTA will also need assistance in
setting up and starting operations of the radio frequency monitoring system. Such assistance will be
included under the supply contract for the equipment for at least a year after installation to ensure proper
functioning.
7.     Training.   For SLTA's radio frequency monitoring system, training will be provided at the
suppliers' facilities and on-the-job during installation. Brief courses and seminars at local and foreign
training institutes would also be arranged for concemed staff and include: system management (2 weeks),
system operations (2 weeks), network operations and management (2 weeks), basic frequency management
(10 weeks), monitoring and inspection (5 weeks), mobile monitoring operations (2 weeks) and equipment
calibration (10 weeks). Courses will be in Sri Lanka or abroad, depending on the number of participants
and the availability of suitable standard courses.
8.     Technical Assistance to PERC. Two groups of consultants will be retained. The first group will
be composed of mainly intemational specialists and consulting firms recruited on a short-term basis to
advise on specific transactions. Their main tasks will be to (a) carry out the necessary studies for policy
and strategy formulation, pre-reform packaging and implementation of privatization transactions; (b) assess
lines for Colombo and 32,000 for the regions. Even discounting the regional lines, the shortfall is, therefore, only
about 6,000 lines compared to the original objective. This shortfall should be seen against, inter alia, the 50,000
private mobile cellular lines and the 50,000 SLT Colombo "emergency scheme" lines, which were a consequence
of the sector liberalization and legal, regulatory and institutional reforms implemented as conditions of project
processing.
3 The radio frequency monitoring equipment provided under the Industrial Development Project III is fully
compatible with the equipment to be provided under the proposed project and will form part of a fully integrated
radio frequency monitoring system. Without the assistance already provided under IDP III, the proposed project
would have been about US$2.0 million more costly.

the past and present situation of the enterprises and identify key issues to be resolved to facilitate
restructuring and privatization; (c) review the existing regulatory framework, examine all regulatory issues,
and recommend changes, as necessary, to implement a successful restructuring and privatization program;
and (d) assist PERC in preparing memoranda, terms of reference and bidding documents as well as in the
transactions and all tasks leading to the sales closure. Local consultants and specialized staff (e.g. lawyers,
financial analysts and technical experts) will be hired on a long-term basis as the core staff to plan and
coordinate GOSL's privatization program. Local technical experts will act as counterparts to intemational
consultants in specific transactions, while others will provide PERC with continuous advisory services
based on their specialization. In addition, for specific large transactions (e.g., telecommunications)
reputable investment banks will be hired to undertake the assignment.
9.     PERC's planned privatization transactions and the estimated cost of transactions to be funded by
IDA under this project component are given in Attachment 2 and summarized below:
1. Colombo Gas Co.               Completed          July 1995       November 1995 (Actual)

10.    Training of PERC staff involved in privatization transactions will be provided on general issues by
IDA's technical assistance team members and consultants recruited for the project. Other training will be
on an ad-hoc basis through brief courses and seminars as the need arises. Furthermore, study tours for
professional staff will be arranged for visits to foreign countries with relevant experience in the
privatization of public enterprises.
Assistance for Radio Spectrum Regulation
11.    Current Situation. SLTA currently operates three fixed monitoring sites and a mobile monitoring
vehicle. A frequency management database, using dBase and containing primarily a frequency list exists,
4 B3ased on IDA funding of one large transaction (like SLT, Air Lanka, etc.) and three medium sized transactions
(Lanka E:lectric Co., Plantations, Manufacturing Units, etc.). The transactions for which IDA funds will be used
have not yet been identified, as the exact order of privatizations will depend on market and political considerations.

but has not been updated, and the necessary software documentation is missing. Furthermore, this software
is not based on modem standards, is difficult to use and not very reliable. An existing server and local area
network (LAN) are not being used. A 1:25,000 series of topographic maps are available on which a
digitized terrain elevation model (DEM) can be established.
12.   Proposed Frequency Management and Monitoring System (FMMS). This project component
will integrate existing equipment with the proposed frequency management and monitoring system. The
project will provide SLTA with the licensing and monitoring tools to adjust its fees for the use of radio
frequencies towards their economic value, thereby increasing the fiscal benefits as well as ensuring the
efficient allocation of a scarce resource. Rapid processing of telecommunications licenses and strict
enforcement of license conditions for the use of the radio frequency spectrum is also essential for the
orderly development of domestic telecommunications facilities and increased private sector participation in
the provision of services. The FMMS will be an integrated hardware and software system consisting of the
following eleven subsystems:
(1)    headquarters computer systems and nationwide networking
(2)    a frequency management database
(3)    frequency management application modules
(4)    a digitized terrain elevation subsystem
(5)    a Geographic Information System (GIS)
(6)    VHF/UHF monitoring equipment and stations
(7)    HF/MF monitoring equipment and stations
(8)    monitoring software
(9)    mobile measurement vehicle equipment
(10)   a satellite monitoring station and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) hub site, and
(I 1)   VSAT network
13.   The proposed frequency management system will use a server for about 14 client computers at its
headquarters facility in Colombo. The frequency management database will contain all necessary tables to
support the licensing of telecommunications services, licenses of operators (including amateur radio
operators), licenses of radio communications equipment vendors, type acceptance of radio communications
equipment, inspection services, monitoring services, the tracking of legal cases, and the accounting related
to fees for all licenses and permits as well as the necessary data for timely billing and collection of license
fees. The monitoring software will reside on client computers in the monitoring stations and will interface
with the central database over a wide area network.
14.    Two broad categories of software will be used for the frequency management; the first used for
licensing, and the second for management of interference. The principal area where automated licensing is
needed is the VHF/UHF spectrum, due to the high demand for fixed and land mobile network services. The
electromagnetic compatibility analysis software will consist of programs for the various services,
interference conditions and planning possibilities (broadcast station-station interference, inter-cell
interference, terrain profile, cellular frequency assignment, microwave frequency planning, HF links,
satellite service area coverage, etc.)
15.    To improve the efficiency in analyzing communications facilities in the VHF/UHF bands, digitized
terrain elevation models will be maintained in database tables. The project will provide the necessary
hardware (scanner, plotter, etc.) and software (for scanning and gridding, database interface, and GIS).

16.     VHF/UHF  monitoring  stations will be installed  in Anuradhapura, Colombo, Galle, Kandy,
Negombo, and Nuwaraeliya. The HF/MF direction finding sites will be located in Anuradhapura, Kandy,
Negombo, and Galle. Equipment for two additional mobile units will also be provided. A central satellite
earth station will perform the dual function of satellite monitoring and serving as the hub site for dedicated
communications between the central headquarters facilities and five VSATs located at the monitoring
stations. A wide area networking software will allow remote control of monitoring sites by operators at the
headquarters facilities.
Project Cost and Financial Plan
17.     The total project cost is estimated at US$21.6 million, with a foreign cost component of US$12.6
million. Detailed costs for SLTA's frequency management and monitoring system have been estimated in
US dollars by consultants, based on mid-1995 price levels. Physical contingencies are estimated at about
5% for civil works and other items. No price escalation has been considered for imported equipment due to
the recent price stability/reductions experienced for this kind of equipment. Detailed project cost estimates
and yearly expenditures are given in Attachment 4 and summarized in Table 1. 1.

3 GOSL/SLTA will contribute existing sites and buildings. Antennas will be installed on existing SLT towers and on rooftops
of existing buildings. Civil works and power supply mainly consist of adaptation of existing properties to the requirements of
the frequency management system and are of a minor nature.

18.   The proposed IDA Credit of US$ 15 million would finance about 69% of the total project cost and
100% of the foreign exchange costs. The remaining cost of US$6.6 million (including US$3.3 million
equivalent for taxes and duties on imported equipment) would be covered by SLTA/GOSL. The design
and specification of the FMMS for SLTA has been financed by a Japanese Trust Fund. The financing plan
for the project is given in table below:

Project Timetable
19.   The project is expected to be completed in about 3.5 years after Board Approval. SLTA's FMMS
would be tendered by July 1996, and the necessary arrangements for technical assistance and consultancy
proposals would be finalized by mid 1996. Transactions presently scheduled by PERC would proceed
according to the operational plan as agreed during negotiations (Attachment 2). A Project Implementation
Plan and timetable for the main project activities is in Attachment 5. The project is expected to be
completed by June 30, 1999.
B. Project Administration and Implementation
20.    SLTA  and PERC will be responsible for the implementation of their respective project
components. A core of professionals within each agency, coordinated by a Project Manager, will be
assigned to manage the implementation of the project (including procurement of goods and services,
implementation monitoring, accounts, audits, and reporting), to work as consultants' counterparts, and to
assist in staff training.
Procurement of Goods and Services
21.    Project TA and training will be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.
Consultants will be hired in accordance with IDA's guidelines for the use of consultants. The frequency
management and monitoring system will be procured under IDA's ICB procedures in a single package,
including detailed design, system integration, hardware, software, staff training, and assistance for the
initial operation of the system. This will encourage bidders' interest and provide single responsibility for
the proper functioning of the system. Procurement of goods costing over US$200,000 will require IDA's
prior review. All other contracts will be subject to random post reviews by visiting supervision missions.
Contracts for hiring consulting firms costing US$100,000 equivalent or more and contracts for hiring
individuals costing US$50,000 equivalent or more will be subject to prior review by IDA. More than 90%
of the value of IDA's credit would require prior review. Office equipment (upto US$70,000) will be
procured through National Competitive Bidding. Table 1.3 below indicates the proposed bid packages,
procurement methods, and estimated amounts.

2 GOSL/SLTA will contribute existing sites and buildings. Antennas will be installed on existing SLT towers and on rooftops
of existing buildings. Civil works and power supply mainly consist of adaptation of existing properties to the requirements of
the frequency management system and are of a minor nature.
C onsists of consultancies for telecom tariffs and other regulatory studies (US$0.8 million) and financial advisors and other
assistance for one major and three minor privatization transactions (US$4.6 million). Potential privatization transactions are
listed in Attachments 2 and 7, e.g. SLT, Air Lanka (major) and Orient Lanka, Lanka Electric Co. and plantations (minor).
4~ Taxes and duties on imported equipment (US$3.3 million) have been excluded.
Disbursement Arran2ements
22.    The IDA  credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100%  of foreign expenditures for imported
equipment and materials, or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally procured goods, or 70% of other locally
procured goods, and (b) 100% of expenditures for consultancy services and training. The projected
disbursement schedule is given in Attachment 6. A summary of projected disbursement is shown in Table
1.4. Advanced preparation of procurement documents should facilitate early implementation and
disbursement. The main procurement consists of one turn-key package and the projected disbursement
period is, therefore, about three years shorter than the standard profile. Full documentation would be
required for all equipment contract above US$200,000, consultant firm contracts above US$100,000, and
individual consultant contracts above US$50,000. Disbursements for contracts below this amounts and all
training expenditures would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting
documentation for SOEs would be retained by SLTA and PERC and made available for review by IDA

Accounts and Audits
23.   To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account will be established at a bank under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. This will be maintained in US dollars with an authorized allocation of
US$500,000 and would be used to cover IDA's share of eligible project expenditures of less that
US$100,000 under all disbursement categories. The authorized allocation shall initially be limited to
US$300,000 until disbursements and outstanding commitments against the Credit equal or exceed SDR3.0
million (US$4.3 million). Applications for replenishment of the account, supported by appropriate
documentation, would be submitted regularly (preferably monthly, but not less that quarterly) or when the
amounts withdrawn equal 50% of the initial deposit.
24.   The Ministry of Finance and Planning will have the overall responsibility for the project accounts.
The audit of project accounts as well as of SLTA and PERC will be conducted by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. SLTA and PERC will maintain their accounting systems in accordance with sound
international principles and practices acceptable to IDA. Each entity will provide interim and annual
financial statements to reflect its financial performance and position. Audited financial statements for
SLTA and PERC and audit reports on the project accounts, including the Special Accounts, and separate
opinions on any SOE, will be provided to IDA within six months of the closing of the fiscal year. The
audit report will include a statement of the adequacy of the accounting procedures, intemal controls, and
compliance with covenants. The accounting and financial reporting should provide adequate and timely
information to IDA for project supervision.
Monitoring, Renortine and Supervision
25.   The timely implementation of the various steps set out in the action plan of the Policy Letter will be
monitored and constitutes a major indicator of the reform progress. IDA will also monitor the overall
performance of SLTA and PERC during project implementation aided by performance indicators
(Attachment 7). Further, as part of its supervision activities, IDA will monitor procurement and project
implementation. This monitoring should assist GOSL and IDA in taking timely corrective action.
26.    SLTA and PERC will submit quarterly progress reports in a format acceptable to IDA within one
month of the end of each quarter. Project accounts will be maintained by each agency, so that the costs of
each project component and credit disbursement can be clearly established. The format of the quarterly
project progress report was discussed and agreed during negotiations.
27.    Supervision of the project will focus on the following key aspects: (a) conversion and development
of SLTA into a more independent regulatory Commission in accordance with the agreed timetable; (b)
timely and effective procurement of goods and services; (c) implementation of the privatization transactions
agreed with PERC; and (d) effective coordination by each agency of the various project components. A
mid-term review is planned for June 1997 of all project activities and would be conducted jointly by the
Ministry of Finance and Planning, SLTA, PERC, and IDA. Upon project completion, an Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) will be prepared. The total estimated IDA input for supervision is 40 staff-
weeks.

8th February, 1996.
Mr. Joseph D. Wood
Vice President
South Asia Region
The World Bank
Thro' The Secretary
Ministry of Finance, Colombo.
Dear Mr. Wood,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR POLICY
In 1995, the Government of Sri Lanka defined its policy
for further development of the telecommunications sector. The
purpose  of this letter is to provide  some details and a time
frame for the implementation of this policy.
02.               The  Government's  broad  objectives  in  the
telecommunications sector are to:
(i)  expand and improve the telecommunications
infrastructure to better support economic,
social and cultural development in Sri Lanka;
(ii) to facilitate new investment and competition in
the sector by strengthening the enabling legal and
regulatory framework; and
(iii) encourage increased private sector participation in
telecommunications development, including the
restructuring.
03.    To achieve these objectives, the Government will undertake
a sector restructuring programme which will involve the following
main activities:
(a) amendment of.the Tfelecommunications Act;
(b)  promoting competition and private participation
in the  provision of telecommunications services:
(c)  restructuring the operations of SLT

Attachment I
page 2of 4
Amendments of the Telecommunications Act:
4.           The Telecommunications Act was passed by Parliament in
1991. During the past four years the 1991 Act has been effective,
it has become evident that the duties placed on the regulator
(Director-General) are so varied that a broader based regulatory
structure would be desirable. Further, the departmental status of
the Authority limits its operational and administrative autonomy
(including salary structure) and is a major constraint on its
ability to discharge its duties efficiently.
5.          A strong and independent  telecommunications  sector
regulator is needed to ensure fair interconnection and revenue
sharing arrangements between the increasing number of service
providers.   Further, as more services are being provided by the
private sector and Government plans to restructure SLT, it is
becoming increasingly important that the consumer protection
aspects of the Telecommunications Act are efficiently implemented.
6.    An amendment to Act was therefore drafted with the objective
to convert the "Sri Lanka Telecommunications Authority" (SLTA)
into a "Commission" which would consist of five "Commissioners"who
have excelled in the  field of engineering,  accountancy,  law,
economics,   public   administration   business   and   commercial
management.   The Commission's   activities   would be financed
through licences and other operator fees rather than through
GOSL's budget and provide it with appropriate financial autonomy.
On 01st February, 1996 the Cabinet decided to amend the 1991
Telecommunications Act accordingly.
Promoting Competition and Private provision of Services.
7.         The  Government  and  the  regulatory  body    for  the
Telecommunications sector will promote competition by adopting
transparent procedures for licensing of operators, facilitating
interconnection, promoting economically sound cost-based pricing
principles, and providing adequate regulatory certainty to
invertors.   Competition will be allowed in the   provision of
telecommunications services (other than basic wired voice
telephony). Operators will be allowed to provide telecommunications
services using technology of their choice, provided the equipment
has been "type" approved and an appropriate operating licence has
been obtained. The number of competitors and the duration of their
license has been obtained.   The number of competitors and the
duration of their licenses will be determined based on market and
economic efficiency considerations.   Transparent and expeditious
procedures for licensing will be used to promote the entry of
competing service providers.   In particular,  two licensees for
radio based basic services are expected to be issued by March,
1996.



Attachment 1
Re-Structuring of SLT                                    Page3of4
8.       It is the Government's objective to transform Sri Lanka
Telecom (SLT) into a commercially operatedL and fully autonomous
entity.   A new corporate entity is to be incorporated under he
Companies Act. to which SLT's assets and liabilities will be
transferred as well as its existing telephone operations.
Within the next two years, SLT's administration and operation, is
expected to have been restructured with additional changes to be
undertaken from time to time as market conditions permit.
9.      To ensure SLT's long-term financial viability, facilitate
competition   and create a level paying  field for all  sector
operators, the Government will make all efforts to ensure that
SLT's prices to end users and its interconnection charges to other
service providers are based on financial costs. S.L.T's existing
tariffs would therefore have to be rebalanced, based on a tariff
study combined with realistic demand forecasts.  Once adequately
balanced S.L.T's tariffs will be regulated by a price cap system
which will be enforced by the regulator.
10.          The  Government  intends  to  implement  this  sector
restructuring programme as per the attached action plan and keep
the Bank informed regularly on the progress of implementation.
Yours sincerely,
K.C. Logeswaran

TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISE REFORM
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Sector Reform Program Study
1.     To assist GOSL in its long term policy formulation and sector refoim initiatives, including
the privatization of SLT and competition, a study will be undertaken by SLTA covering: (i) tariff
structure and levels; (ii) demand for connections and traffic; (iii) quality of service standards; (iv)
expansion into rural and less profitable areas; (v) market structure and (vi) interconnection and
revenue sharing arrangements. Of special interest would be an analysis of the inter-relationship
between those areas, e.g., the impact of telecommunications tariffs on demand and market
structure, including SLT's privatization. A brief description of each area follows below:
(a)    Tariffs. SLT's local tariffs are amongst the lowest in the world. The tariffs referred to are
connection fees, local call charges and monthly subscription fees. The long-distance tariffs are
relatively high, especially the domestic ones. This may have encouraged uneconomic demand for
connection of subscribers that make few long-distance calls, e.g. residential subscribers. Other
effects of this tariff structure include: relatively low revenues per annum, declining profitability of
SLT, reduced demand for other communications means, e.g. pagers, call offices, cellular facilities
etc. and costly SLT investments to catch up with demand for telephone lines that may not be
profitable.
(b)    Demand. The most recent demand study is from 1991. Since then, SLT's network has
expanded, private telecommunications operators have established themselves in the market and new
services have been introduced. A new demand study should, therefore, be undertaken. An important
element of such a study should be to estimate the residential groups ability and willingness to pay
increased tariffs, point elasticities for a basket of charges/services (monthly, local, long-distance,
and international charges) , and the impact of tariff changes on the future demand for service.
(c)    Quality of Service. SLT's service quality is inadequate and realistic annual targets for its
improvement should be established. If it is decided to rebalance SLT's local tariffs, i.e. increasing
the monthly rental and/or connection fee, this may be made more acceptable to the subscribers by
improving SLT's service quality (and billing), e.g. the increase in certain tariffs could be coupled to
the achievement of service quality standards specified in the operating license for a future private
operator.
(d)    Rural Areas. Suitable targets, license conditions and incentives should be built into the
operating license of SLT, and cellular, pay phones and other operators to expand into rural and
less profitable areas. Tariff structure, interconnection, revenue sharing and other arrangements
should be studied with a view to identify such incentives.
(e)    Market Structure. Low SLT tariffs may reduce the demand for other services which are
priced commercially, i.e. based on the cost of providing the service and market competition.
Example of such services are: paging, pay phones, cellular and data transmission. Further, the
price offered for SLT at its privatization by potential strategic investors is likely to be relatively

Attachment 3
Page 2 of 2
low if tariffi are not rebalanced. After an eventual exclusivity period for basic services, SLT's
profitable business subscriber (who generate most of long-distance calls) could be taken over by
competitors, leaving SLT with the residential subscribers (that generate few long-distance calls)
and a consequent fall in SLT's profitability.
(f)   Interconnection and Revenue Sharing Arrangements. Given the increasing number of
competitive telecommunications operators in the sector, interconnection and revenue sharing
arrangements have become important issues. The current arrangements will be evaluated to ensure
these arrangements between the various operators, including SLT, are equitable.
2.    The data collection and initial analysis of each area of the study will be contracted with
suitably qualified local consultancy firms when available. The detailed analysis and study - le
inter-relation between the various elements (e.g. the impact of various tariff structures and -vels
on demand, competition and SLT's value) should be carried out by a well qualified consulting firm
with international experience and ability to be the responsible party for the study as a whole.
3.    This study will build on relevant available information and the research of other studies
already completed, e.g.:
e the Telecommunications Act of 1991;
* the World Bank Telecommunications Sector Report of 1994;
*   relevant parts of the Technical Annex for the proposed "Telecommunications Regulation and
Public Enterprise Reform Technical Assistance Project", and
* other relevant information available with MOPT, SLTA, SLT, and IDA.
4.    The study will be initiated in mid-1996 and an interim report will be ready by end-1996.
The report will be finalized by early 1997.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Performance Indicators
1. Proiect Implementation (Project as a whole)
(a)   timely completion of steps in GOSL's Telecommunications Policy Letter (Attachment 1)
and PERC's Operational Plan (Attachment 2);
(b)   timely achievement of the implementation plans for each project component (Attachment
5); and
(c)    number and seriousness of observations in the project audit reports.
II. The Telecommunications Rezulation Component (SLTA Implementing Agencv)
I.    Inputs:
(a)    radio frequency management system; and
(b)    TA and training of SLTA staff
2.     Outcome:
(a)    radio frequency monitoring of the HF band all over Sri Lanka and the VHF and UHF
bands wherever they are intensively used; and
(b)    adequate procedures for licensing, billing of license fees, interconnection, pricing, dispute
settlements, consumer protection, monitoring of operators (including quality of service)
3.     Expected Impact:
(a)    availability of frequencies for new services as may be widely offered in more advanced
countries, e.g. USA, Sweden, and UK;
(b)   increased competition in the provision of services measured in number of service
providers, service prices, number of new services, etc. as compared with advanced
countries;
(c)    new operating licenses granted as necessary for (a) and (b) above, ideally without license
disputes and efficient settlement of disputes if they occur; if new services are not made
available or if prices are higher than in other countries, the project has not fully achieved
its objectives;
(d)   increased SLTA revenues from license fees as compared to 1996;
(e)   improved quality of service, reaching international standards by the year 2000; and
(f)    elimination of waiting lists and satisfaction of demand at cost recovery prices, including
rural and less profitable areas, by the year 2000.
