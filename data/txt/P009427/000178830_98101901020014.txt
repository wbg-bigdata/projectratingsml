BANGLADESH
RURAL DEVELOPMENT II PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has requested the International
Development Association (IDA) for assistance in financing a Second Rural
Development Project. The project is based on the experience gained under a
number of IDA supported agricultural and rural development projects which
have involved the GOB's Integrated Rural Development Program (IRDP), in
particular the first Rural Development Project, Cr. 631-BD (RD-I) and the
Shallow Tubewells Project, Cr. 724-BD. The policy framework of the proposed
second project has emerged from a Joint Review of IRDP, conducted by GOB and
IDA in 1980-81 and similar joint reviews of minor irrigation and agricul-
tural credit sectors. 1/
1.02    A team set up by GOB prepared the project with some assistance from
FAO/CP. Further preparation was required and this was merged with appraisal
of the project which started in September 1982, and was managed by the
Resident Mission in Bangladesh (RMB). Appraisal was completed in October
1982. The preparation and appraisal team comprised Messrs. A. K. Seth,
I. Ahmed, W. Kock, K. Loganathan, H. Sanger and Ms. W. Huq (IDA) and Messrs.
R. Lesire, R. Raturi and K. Selvavinayagam (FAO/CP).
II. AGRICULTURAL AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT SECTOR
A. Production and Constraints
2.01    Bangladesh's economy is predominantly agricultural and agriculture
accounts for 57% of GDP, 75% of all direct or indirect employment and over
80% of the country's exports. Out of a total land area of 35 million acres,
about 22.5 million acres are under cultivation at a cropping intensity
averaging about 150%. Rice is by far the most important crop and accounts
for over 80% of the cultivated area; jute is the principal export and
industrial raw material crop and accounts for 6%; and a variety of other
crops, such as wheat, pulses, tobacco, oilseeds, sugarcane, and vegetables
make up the balance.

2.02    Bangladesh still suffers from a chronic shortage of foodgrains,
though growth in foodgrain production has accelerated in recent years and
was 2.6% over the period 1970-1981 compared to aL population growth rate of
2.7%. However, annual production varies considerably, and in years of bad
production annual imports have reached 1.5 M tons. To achieve self suf-
ficiency, which is a major target of GOB's development programs, would
require a growth rate of 7% if it is to be achieved by 1985, the end of
GOB's Second Five Year Plan (SFYP). This would be difficult to achieve even
though the technology for achieving this growth in production exists and has
been in use in Bangladesh since the mid sixties. Full exploitation of this
new technology depends on the prompt elimination of many constraints.
2.03    Production is held back by physical, socio-economic, institutional,
and resource constraints. Practically all of the 22.5 M ac cultivable land
is fully utilized and increases in production must therefore come from
intensification. However, nearly two-thirds of the cultivable area is
affected by flood and drainage problems of varying intensities, and only
4 M ac are protected by physical works such as embankments and drains. Dry
season irrigation, which avoids the flood problem, is now available for only
4 M ac. About 70% of farms are below 2 ac in size and are often fragmented
into as many as 10 parcels. About 25% of farm families own less than one
acre, and about 40% of all land is sharecropped. The rural power structure
is well entrenched. In this situation small and marginal farmers pay dearly
for tenure and credit, and have poor access to GOB supported services and
inputs. Generally, rural areas are physically isolated due to poor road
communications, and they lack the basic physical infrastructure needed for
the development of rural industry or for effective administration of GOB's
development efforts.
2.04    Farmers, who are hard working and responsive to innovation, depend
on a number of GOB agencies for essential inputs, credit, technical advice,
and price incentives required for the widespread adoption of the HYV based
technology. Given the small scale of the average farmer-s needs for water,
fertilizer, and credit, and the small size of his marketable surplus, GOB
agencies have difficulties in effectively interacting with farmers. In
addition, poor coordination between GOB agencies providing complementary
services slows down the spread of the new technology. While actions are
underway to improve the performance of GOB agencies serving the farmer,
fiscal constraints prohibit any significant expansion. Consequently GOB is
placing greater reliance on the private sector in providing those services
which are commercial in nature and marketing of fertilizers and pesticides,
import and retailing of minor irrigation equipment and their repair and
maintenance, are being increasingly privatized.
2.05    Overshadowing the problem of small and marginal farmers is that of
the landless. Reliable data is available from the Land Occupancy Survey of
1977; a new survey is to be done in 1983. Available evidence shows that the



-3-
problem has become more acute. Even in 1977, about a third of the rural
households had no land under cultivation and a large proportion of
households (20%) were seeking employment and incomne opportunities outside
the farm sector. The rural scene is characterized by widespread poverty.
Using a daily calorie intake of 2,100 as indicating the poverty line, the
percentage of rural population below the poverty 'Line has increased from 65%
in 1964 to 87% in 1977 and this trend has continued. Such widespread rural
poverty and real low wages for agricultural labor, are limiting the purchas-
ing power of rural people and thus the effective demand for foodgrains.
GOB-s intervention to purchase foodgrains at guaranteed prices offers only a
partial and so far ineffective solution to the problem of lack of effective
demand.
B. GOB Production Strategy and Role of TCCA/KSS
2.06    The SFYP and the Medium Term Food Production Plan (MTFPP) developed
with IDA's assistance 1/ give top priority to the achievement of foodgrain
self sufficiency by increasing production from 13.5 M tons in 1978 to 20.0 M
tons by 1985. This is to be achieved by a basic strategy to make use of the
initiative of the nation's 7 million private farmers by providing them with
the resources and services that they have shown themselves to be able to use
effectively. Thus, 85% of physical investment under the SFYP/MTFPP is
concentrated on provision of water control and dry season irrigation
facilities, supply of complementary inputs and access to markets. Suppor-
tive rural institutions, credit and input supply mechanisms and extension
and research are to be strengthened. Finally, greater reliance is to be
placed on the private sector, on reduction of subsidies, and on increasing
efforts for domestic resource mobilization. The MTFPP started off well with
a 10% increase in foodgrain production in FY81 but then ran into two
unusually dry years. However, expansion of irrigation under MTFPP is
proceeding close to plans (para 2.08).
2.07    Bangladesh-s own rural development model - the so called Comilla
Model - originated in response to constraints similar to those described
above (para 2.03). An integral element of the model was the establishment
of Thana Central Cooperative Associations (TCCA) located at the headquarters
of the 450 thanas into which Bangladesh is divided administratively; and
agricultural cooperative societies - Krishi Shamabay Samities (KSS) -
located in the 68,000 villages of Bangladesh. Other components of the
Comilla Model were: (a) Rural Works Program, planned and implemented
through local councils for building local infrastructure; (b) Thana Training
and Development Center to bring together physically the various government
agencies, local councils and TCCA; and (c) Thana I;rrigation Program to

utilize irrigation equipment, and maintain them. After a decade of success-
ful experimentation in 20 thanas, the Comilla concept of TCCA/KSS was
expanded nationwide under the aegis of the Integrated Rural Development
Program (IRDP), an agency of GOB's Ministry of Rural Development and
Cooperatives; while other components were expanded nationwide under separate
programs managed by other GOB agencies. The Joint Review by GOB and IDA
reviewed the nationwide performance of IRDP. The Review, the report of
which was approved by the Cabinet in August 1982, found that the TCCA/KSS
system had been playing a useful - through far below potential - role in
furthering GOB's agricultural and rural development plans and that it was a
valuable resource to be used for achieving objectives of GOB's development
plans. As recommended in the Joint Review, IRDP has recently been estab-
lished as an autonomous Bangladesh Rural Development Board (para 2.17).
Minor Irrigation Development
2.08    In the Bangladesh context, with substantial surface water flows but
with a topography that almost excludes any large scale gravity irrigation,
farmers have traditionally depended upon small scale lift irrigation from
surface water bodies using Low Lift Pumps (LLPs) of 1-2 cusec capacity.
Since the early seventies, however, Bangladesh's large ground water resour-
ces have been increasingly exploited for irrigation in the dry season by
diesel engine operated Shallow Tubewells (STWs) of 0.5-0.75 cusec capacity
and Deep Tubewells (DTWs) of 2 cusec capacity as well as by simple manually
operated Hand Tubewells (HTWs) capable of irrigating half to one acre of
land. LLPs, DTWs, STWs and HTWs are collectively referred to as minor
irrigation equipment. Minor irrigation development is a key component of
the MTFPP, and its expansion up to end of FY82 was generally encouraging,
except for HTW and DTW programs which were constrained by poor supply of
equipment to meet farmer demand.

2.09    Groundwater resources, which are expected to provide 45% of the
irrigation water used for agricultural production by 1985, are very ade-
quate. Bangladesh is part of a geological basin which contains a major
aquifer complex saturated with groundwater. Three major inter-connected
water bearing zones, the composite aquifer, the main aquifer and the deep
aquifer have been identified. The composite aquifer, at a depth varying
from a few meters in the north to as much as 60 meters in the south, con-
sists of silty to fine sand overlaying the main aquifer. Extraction from



-5-
this aquifer is possible by shallow tubewells for irrigation as well as for
rural water supplies. The main aquifer consists of medium and coarse-ground
sandy sediments, occasionally inter-bedded with gravel, which extends to
depths averaging 140 meters. Extraction is by deep tubewells primarily for
irrigation (see Map). The deep aquifer, ranging from 150 meters to 450
meters in depth, has been mainly exploited for urban and industrial water
supplies in Dhaka and in the coastal areas. Present groundwater resources
are utilized as follows:

2.10    The policy framework for the development of the minor irrigation
sector is based on the experience gained under a number of GOB and IDA
financed projects, and was drawn up in the course of the Joint GOB/IDA
Review of the minor irrigation sector. It is now basic GOB policy to
encourage private ownership of irrigation equipment rather than their rental
from GOB as in the past, and to encourage the private sector in the import,
retailing, and subsequent servicing of these equipment, rather than operate
a GOB monopoly for these activities. IDA financed Agricultural Credit
Project (1147-BD) has assisted GOB in its first major effort to support
private sector import and retailing of STWs. STWs have for long been sold
to farmers at full cost, but sales of new LLPs and DTWs are presently sub-
sidized by 20% and 75Z respectively. LLPs and DTWs previously owned by GOB
have now been put on sale, supported by credit. GOB is gradually reducing
subsidies with the aim of progressively eliminating them. Since 1980,
rental rates charged for LLPs and DTWs which still remain with GOB have been
trebled and subsidy on sale of new LLPs has been halved, while the selling
price of DTWs has been increased by 40%.
2.11    A critical factor in the effective development of irrigated agricul-
ture is the relatively large areas (DTW 100 ac, LLP 40 ac, STW 15 ac) which
need to be irrigated for the economic operation of the existing minor
irrigation equipment, which are almost all operated by diesel engines. As
rural electrification expands, small horsepower units would become economi-
cally feasible. Given the small size and fragmentation of holdings and the
vast number of farmers to be reached, farmers have to work in groups to



-6-
optimize the use of such equipment. The Joint Review has supported the
encouragement given by GOB to TCCA/KSS for expanding their role in minor
irrigation development.
2.12    TCCA/KSS participation in the national minor :Lrrigation program has
been important and has been regularly supported by IDA under its project and
program credits.   For example, in 1980, as part of IDA's Imports X Program
Credit (Cr. 1194-BD), GOB launched a nationwide program of term credit to
TCCA/KSS for purchase of minor irrigation equipment and such purchases have
been significant in recent years as shown below:

However, less than 45% of existing  A- and  B  class KSS 1/ have irrigation
facilities.
Irrigation Management Program (IMP)
2.13    Minor irrigation equipment is currently irrigating an average of
20-25 acres for one cusec installed capacity while the potential would be at
least 50% greater. Primary reasons for the under-utilization of equipment
is the poor organization and management of user groups. To remedy this
problem, Irrigation Management Program (IMP) was introduced in the RD-I
Project in 1979-80. Under IMP, BRDB, BADC and Department of Agricultural
Extension (DAE) officers at the district and thana levels jointly support
the TCCA to increase the command area per irrigation equipment and thus
reduce the cost of irrigation. Essential features of the program are:
(a) preparation of action plans; (b) organizing KSS meetings to explain
utility of water management; (c) training of managers, and chairmen of KSS,
TCCA inspectors, village accountants, block leaders, fieldmen, and tubewell
operators; (d) preparation of land maps and land registers; (e) laying of
irrigation channels; (f) preparation of irrigation budgets; and (g) obtain-
ing credit for production costs. The program has been. very successful
1/ Since 1980, IRDP has a system of classifying KSS according to perfor-
mance on membership, loan recovery, savings, and related factors
(Schedule B); 'A  and -B  class KSS are judged to be active and viable.



-7-
(Annex 1, Table 10). During 1981-82, IMP covered 43 T(CA and 430 irrigation
units and on average increased command areas by 53%, farmer participation by
35% and yields by 15%. Because of such promising results, GOB has decided
to replicate IMP on a nationwide basis and has published a comprehensive
manual in Bengali for implementing IMP. BRDB has been given the respon-
sibility for monitoring IMP activities and Rural Development Academy, Bogra
the responsibility for training GOB staff with the assistance of an UNDP/FAO
project. IDA is supporting the implementation of IMP in three districts
under the DTW II Project (Cr. 1287-BD).
Rural Institutions
2.14    The TCCA/KSS system is the basic system of farmer cooperatives and
between 1978 and 1982, the system has grown as follows:
FY78              FY82
Number of TCCA                             250               350
Number of KSS                           27,500            48,800
% of 'A' and 'B' Class KSS                 N/A                48
Paid Membership ('000)                     844             1,690
Total Savings and Shares (Tk M)             54               163
2.15    This growth has been achieved despite a difficult environment in
which the system has been unable to guarantee the flow of services most in
demand by its members. Thus apart from 74 TCCAs, which are the
beneficiaries of projects financed by IDA and other donors, the services in
greatest demand by members - minor irrigation equipment, medium term credit,
fertilizer, and seed - have been rarely available to the TCCA, because of
the failure of the public sector agencies controlling their supply to meet
TCCA demands. These problems have not been totally absent in the case of
TCCA assisted by IDA, though the position has been much better; as has been
the performance of these TCCA compared to others. This is evident by comi-
parison between the 7 TCCAs of RD-I Project and the nationwide TCCA program:
Bangladesh   RD-I
Number of TCCA                                            350           7

/a RD-I average figure is low because for the 1,070 KSS in the
District of Mymensingh, where only DTWs are feasible, no irrigation

-8-
2.16    While the TCCA/KSS system has expanded rapidly in recent years, its
qualitative performance is far less impressive. For example, about
two-thirds of the membership of  A' and  B' class KSS does not participate
in the system's credit program, partly because of cumbersome procedures and
partly because 55% of these KSS do not yet have irrigation facilities which
tend to drive the demand for credit. At least half of the KSS which have
been organized are not active, partly because of the problem of providing
real services to their members. Problems of equity and maladministration
are pervasive even among the active KSS; for example, while the membership
of the small and medium size farmers reflects the general situation, the
managing committees tend to be dominated by larger farmers. 1/ In part
these problems arise because of the ineffectiveness of the Department of
Cooperatives in ensuring the holding of Annual General Mleetings, conducting
of timely audit, weaknesses that in part are due to ambiguities in coopera-
tive laws (para 2.22).
2.17    The Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB) which promotes the
growth of the TCCA/KSS system, was established by GOB in December 1982. Its
establishment eliminated the uncertainty that in recent years has shrouded
the status of IRDP and its staff; an uncertainty which had led to con-
siderable demoralization of the staff responsible for promoting the TCCA/KSS
system. BRDB is managed by a Governing Council, of which the Minister of
Rural Development and Cooperatives is the Chairman, and Secretary Rural
Development, the Vice Chairman, and whose other members are:
-   Secretaries of Agriculture and Forests, Fisheries and Livestock,
Irrigation, Water Development and Flood Control, Local Government,
Finance, and Energy divisions (6);
-   Chairman of BADC (1);
-   Registrar of Cooperatives (1);
-   Member (Agricultural and Rural Institutions), Planning Commission (1);
-   Director, Rural Development Academy, Comilla (or Bogra, alterna-
tively) (1);
-   Representative of a major financial institution (1);
-   Chairman, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (1);
1/ In a sample of 25 TCCAs, 44% of the members of the managing committees
were from among farmers who had more than 5 ac of land, while only 23%
of the membership was from this group.



-9-
-   five elected Representatives from the National Federation of TCCAs (5);
-   one Nominee of the National Cooperative Union (1);
-   Director General, BRDB, as Member Secretary (1).
2.18    Under its charter, the role of BRDB is to:
(a) promote village based cooperatives and TCCA so that they become, in
the shortest possible time, autonomous, self- managed and viable
vehicles for increasing production, employment and rural develop-
ment;
(b) encourage functional cooperatives for sponsoring income generating
activities for the rural poor;
(c) promote intensive irrigated agriculture as a means of cooperative
development as well as for efficient use of irrigation facilities;
(d) channel and ensure productive utilization of institutional credit
through village cooperatives and TCCA system and promote members
accumulation of deposits and savings;
(e) encourage financially viable TCCA to diversify activities, espe-
cially in marketing of agricultural inputs and produce;
(f) arrange for effective training of members;
(g) promote the growth of federations of TCCAs at the district and
national levels with a view to progressively hand over to them the
promotional, motivational and educational functions relating to
rural development;
(h) liaise with concerned agencies for mobilizing supplies, services and
support for the cooperative system; and
(i) engage competent evaluation teams and research institutions to study
and evaluate the progress made and effectiveness of the projects and
programs of the Board.
2.19    A Director General, a GOB official of the rank of Additional
Secretary, is the Chief Executive of BRDB. He is presently supported by
three Directors, responsible for Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation,
and, Finance and Administration. At Dhaka, BRDB currently has about 40
officers and in the field its strength will increase to 1,500 from 1,000 as
TCCA are established in all 450 thanas. The BRDB-s 22 district offices are
staffed by a Project Director (PD), and two Deputy Project Directors (DPDs)
with a small accounts cell. PDs monitor the implementation of BRDB's



-10-
projects, assist in promotional activities and most importantly ensure the
availability of inputs to TCCA from GOB and private sector agencies at the
district level. To facilitate the development of TCCA, BRDB recruits,
trains and seconds to each TCCA, three key staff: a Thana Project Officer
(TPO), a Deputy Project Officer, and an Accountant whose salaries BRDB pays.
The TPO works as the Secretary to the Managing Committee of the TCCA. The
committee is elected for a one year term. All other staff of the TCCA
(approximately 25 inspectors and village accountants) are paid out of TCCAs'
own earnings.
2.20    BRDB operates a Rural Development Training Institute (RDTI) at
Sylhet. The RDTI is used for staff training, but because facilities are
still incomplete, in-service and pre-service training of BRDB staff are
lagging behind requirements. Facilities of the Rural Development Academy
(RDA) at Comilla and the recently completed Bogra RDA 1/ also are used to
the extent available by BRDB for staff training. The two RDAs undertake
action research in rural development strategies and also organize special
training for innovative programs to be executed by TCCA/KSS. The RDA, Bogra
has gradually become the focal point for the training for IMP (para 2.13),
and is presently engaged in useful action research in the field of special
programs to create income generating activities for the rural poor (para
2.41).
2.21    The Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) is responsible for the
registration, audit and inspection of all cooperatives under the Cooperative
Societies Act, 1940. RCS staff, which number 2,250 have not increased as
the cooperative network has grown. RCS staff also promote and supervise the
operation of the non-Comilla type (or traditional) cooperatives, only 6-10%
of which are active. This has overburdened the RCS. As a result, as of
October 1982, audits of 12,000 KSS and 83 TCCA were overdue for more than
one year. To train the auditors responsible for KSS audit, RCS operates a
Cooperative College in Comilla (CCC), whose facilities are underutilized due
to financial constraints. Thus quality of audit has deteriorated steadily.
In recognition of this weakness, audit of TCCAs under IDA assisted projects
is currently assigned to locally recruited firms of auditors.
2.22    Following the completion of the Joint IRDP Review, GOB has decided
to merge the two cooperative systems, TCCA/KSS and traditional, starting
from the village level and also to reallocate the role of the RCS, BRDB,
TCCA and the bank which finances the TCCA so as to maintain a system of
checks and balances. The reallocated functions are:

Cooperative laws which the Registrar administers, have not been reviewed
since 1940. These laws have been found in practice to be ineffective in
dealing with credit defaulters and in regulating mis-managed cooperatives.
Current rules, because of their ambiguity, allow chairmen of defaulting KSS
to be represented on the managing committee of a TCCA. Other necessary
improvements relate to the one year term of elected member which is short
for good management, secret ballotting, reservation of one position on the
managing committee for a BSS member and creation of a bad debt fund. GOB is
undertaking an amendment of the Cooperative Act to overcome these deficien-
cies.
Rural Credit
2.23    Since 1976, when the Special Agricultural Credit Program (SACP) was
launched, Bangladesh has operated a multi-agency approach to provide
institutional credit to farmers. All six Nationalized Commercial Banks
(NCBs), Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB) and Bangladesh Shamabaya Bank Ltd.
(BSBL) which is the apex bank for the traditional cooperatives, have par-
ticipated in it. Bangladesh Bank (BB) has supported SACP by liberal
refinance, on average refinancing 40% of total agricultural lending.
However, the TCCA/KSS system was excluded from SACP and received its finance
from Sonali Bank, a nationalized commercial bank, without access to
refinance from BB. Total lending for agriculture has increased from
Tk 470 M in FY76 to Tk 4,395 M in FY 82. The relative lending operations of
credit agencies are as follows:

/a  Including BKB's diversified lending for agro industry and
tea which amounts to nearly 45% of its total lending.
2.24    GOB has placed considerable emphasis on rural credit and as a
result, the number of rural branches of NCBs and BKB has now reached 2,850.
Compared to only a third in 1972, these branches now comprise nearly
two-thirds of all NCB/BKB branches. In addition, credit is available at
27,000 'A' and 'B' class KSS. This has contributed to the expansion of
rural credit and deposits. Rural deposits account for 16% of total deposits
with the above institutions and rural advances now account for 95% of rural
deposits compared to only 34% in 1975. All TCCA deposits are kept with
Sonali Bank. In 1982, these amounted to Tk 245 M or 89% of TCCA/KSS annual
lending. About two-thirds of these deposits were thrift savings and share
deposits; the remaining were accumulated profits and surpluses.
2.25    TCCA/KSS as a group tend to reach smaller farmers and thus to sup-
port a much larger number of farming households than indicated by the sys-
tem's share of total lending volume:

2.26    Despite the uncertainty and serious morale problem that has
afflicted BRDB staff since 1976, the relative loan recovery performance of
the TCCA/KSS system is satisfactory. Loan recovery can be measured in two
ways; as a loan recovery profile, or as an annual recovery index. The
profile shows the percentage of recovery at a point in time against loans
given in each fiscal year. As loans given in a particular year are col-
lected over the following years, the profile shows an increasing trend
approaching 100% performance for good recovery and stopping at much below
100% for poor performance. Loan recovery profiles for various institutions
are shown below:

2.27    Annual recovery index measures the actual recovery in a 12 month
period of a fiscal year, against total including previous overdues, due for
recovery during the fiscal year. This index has tended to deteriorate for
all credit agencies, and GOB is taking action, which would be supported
under the project, to arrest this trend.

/b Excluding TCCA/KSS lending.
2.28    BSBL, the national apex bank of the traditional cooperatives has
often been suggested as the logical agency for refinancing the TCCA/KSS.
However, the Agricultural Credit Review has indicated that major reform of
BSBL will be required to allow it to become so.  This is now under con-
sideration of GOB but the nature of the changes is such that their implemen-
tation will require a gradual approach starting in a limited geographical
area, possibly a district or subdivision. Hence, the possibility of BSBL
being used as a channel for TCCA lending under the proposed project is
remote.
2.29    Sonali Bank (SB) is the largest commercial bank in Bangladesh with
the most experience in agricultural lending. Its total agricultural lending
was Tk 740 M in FY82, about 35% through TCCA. SB's total assets increased
from Tk 9,000 M to Tk 24,000 M between FY77 and FY81, while deposits grew
from Tk 4,500 M to Tk 9,500 M over the same period. In 1980-81 it made a
net profit of Tk 232 M. While profitable overall, 55% of its newly estab-
lished rural branches showed losses. Its accounting system is satisfactory
and bad debt reserves for agriculture (Tk 70 M) fully cover agricultural
overdues more than 3 years old. SB operates through 1,026 branches (705
rural) and has established a rural credit department with 50 professional
staff at head office, headed by a deputy general manager. Field staff
consist of about 1,000 special agricultural workers supervised by 37
agricultural graduates and farm technologists. SB has excellent training
facilities, and training in agricultural lending is being added to its
training programs.
2.30    SB is participating in all IDA and donor assisted projects providing
credit to TCCA. Current TCCA/KSS lending terms and conditions allow some
flexibility for delayed recoveries at the TCCA level, but are essentially
strict at the KSS and member level where 100% repayment of past loans is a
condition for further loans. In Bangladesh, with its complex cropping
systems, the inputs of a crop are often required before a farmer can sell



-15-
off and repay the loans for a preceeding crop. Such requirements and cum-
bersome loan sanction procedures have tended to restrict the growth in
lending volume. In addition, Sonali Bank has little incentive to lend to
TCCA since it has been denied the normal refinance available at 6% from
Bangladesh Bank under SACP. Furthermore, given that the Sonali Bank branch
manager receives his funds for lending to a TCCA at an internal transfer
price of 11% and lends it to the TCCA at 7.5%, the branch manager has no
real incentive to increase lending to TCCA. These and other factors con-
straining the credit program of the TCCA have been studied in the GOB/IDA
Joint Reviews of IRDP and of Agricultural Credit. The fact that many such
obvious anomalies have been permitted to exist for so long is one of the
most important reasons why progress in agricultural development in
Bangladesh has been less than what it would have been. The changes needed
to reform the TCCA/KSS credit system, which would be implemented under this
project, are discussed in Chapter IV.
2.31    Apart from financial procedures and interest rates, per acre ceil-
ings on loans are prescribed by BB for various crops on the basis of recom-
mendation of the Ministry of Agriculture. They have left much to be desired
and were stagnant for almost three years. These have recently been revised
to satisfactory levels based on the recommendation of the Agricultural
Credit Review:
Crop Credit Ceilings (Tk/Ac)

Tobacco                  600        1,250
Rural Infrastructure
2.32    GOB's effort to achieve rural uplift is now reflected in the
decentralization of administration to the thana level and a concurrent
emphasis on rural roads, rural electrification, development of physical
facilities at the thana headquarters, and the establishment of rural input
supply and marketing facilities. Excluding the national and district high-
ways there are 60,000 miles of village to market roads, 13,000 miles of
roads connecting union and thana headquarters, and 5,000 miles of rural
feeder roads, which connect thana HQ and important market places. Over 85%
of these roads are in need of major repair and construction. GCIB is now
strengthening its Rural Works Program (RWP) to improve these roa,ds. A rural
roads project is being prepared for IDA financing. GOB attaches; high
priority to rural electrification and many donor assisted projects including



-16-
one financed by IDA (Cr. 1262-BD), are now under construction in 100 thanas.
The Rural Electrification Board (REB) includes a representative of BRDB.
REB presently operates some 120,000 rural connections, more than 85% of
which are domestic.
2.33    Thana Training and Development Centers (TTDC) are built by GOB for
the use of its officials posted to the thana. A TTDC complex is owned by
the Thana Council and typically consists of a two-storey building with
12,000 sft. office space and a training hall, plus 15-25 ac of land to
accommodate housing, demonstration plots, TCCA buildings, workshops, diesel
fuel tanks, fertilizer godowns and other similar facilities. All but 40
thanas in the country have a TTDC. About 16 key GOB officials are eligible
to be provided with housing in the TTDC when available. Allowing for 260
donor financed units now under construction, about 820 additional housing
units are needed to provide essential housing facilities in all thanas as
shown below:

12 Units               38
16 Units                6
About 276 TCCA do no yet have an office building but about 135 are to be
built under ongoing projects.
Input Supply and Marketing
2.34    Input Supply:  Until 1978, the supply of farm inputs to farmers had
been the monopoly of BADC which owns, rents and operates 1,124 godowns
totalling 360,000 tons capacity and currently markets 850,000 tons of fer-
tilizers annually. Under a New Marketing System (NMS) introduced in 1978,
BADC has withdrawn from its Thana Sales Centers (TSC) to about 110 primary
distribution points, except in about 120 'remote thanas where for various
reasons, the response from private sector dealers has been poor. NMS now
covers the entire country. It has been judged to have been successful 1/ in
introducing the private retailing of fertilizers. Prior to the introduction
of NMS, BADC had given wholesale distribution rights in their thanas to
about 65 TCCA which either owned or rented godowns. For these TCCA the NMS
1/ A formal joint evaluation by GOB/USAID is presently underway and a
report is expected by March 1983.



-17-
has led to the loss of their market share from 55% to 17%. A greater con-
cern to GOB is that in these thanas, along with the reduction in TCCA market
share, total sales of fertilizers have declined by 35% between 1980, when
NMS was extended nationwide in 1982 (Annex 1, Table 5). GOB has now taken
action to remedy this situation by:
(a)  asking BADC to continue to provide fertilizer to TCCAs on credit;
(b)  renting BADC godowns to TCCAs at those TSC which have been closed
down;
(c)  offering fertilizer wholesalership to TCCAs in -remote- thanas; and
(d)  encouraging TCCA to extend fertilizer marketing to the KSS level
using the experience of an FAO assisted fertilizer marketing pilot
program, which has demonstrated that fertilizer sales increase
significantly when supported by credit and made available at the
KSS.
2.35    Most farm produce is marketed immediately after harvest.  Because of
the need for cash, problems of on-farm storage and need to repay crop
production loans, most farmers are unable to hold stocks over an extended
period. The private sector handles roughly 75-80% of the marketed grain
through 8,500 primary markets. Farmers have the option to sell t:heir grain
to the Ministry of Food (MOF) which operates a price support program pur-
chasing foodgrain at about 850 locations. It is estimated that only 20%
of MOF procurement of grains comes directly from farmers because farmers
find the MOF purchase centers inaccessible and purchase and payment proce-
dures complicated for the typically small amounts (2-10 mds) they have for
sale.  Since 1979 GOB has been developing a new TCCA/KSS based paddy and
rice marketing system.  The so called 'Mukta' marketing project is now in
trial operation in four TCCAs, under the IDA financed Second Foocdgrain
Storage project (Cr. 787-BD).  Under the pilot project farmers retceive
payment for their sales at the KSS at the going market price within 24 hours
and later receive two bonuses, one from KSS and the other from TCCA after
final sales. Over the last nine marketing seasons, the final price received
by farmers from TCCA after covering all operating costs has been 26% higher
than MOF official purchase prices.
Support Services
2.36    GOB provides agricultural extension services through the Department
of Agriculture. An IDA supported Extension and Research Project (Cr.
729-BD) has helped establish in five districts of the country a single
training and visit (T&V) type extension system that replaced six separate
services that operated on a separate crop basis. A follow-up Second Exten-
sion and Research Project (Cr. 1215-BD) is helping to extend the system and
unification on a nationwide basis. A farmer to extension worker ratio of



-18-
1,000:1 is expected to be achieved by 1987. Training of the extension staff
is at 14 Agricultural Extension and Training Institutes (AETIs), four of
which were built under IDA financed Agricultural and Rural Training Project
(Cr. 621-BD).
C. Special Programs for the Rural Poor
2.37    It has been estimated that if production targets of MTFPP are
reached, agriculture can at best absorb only about 20% 1/ of the expected
addition to the rural labor force expected by 1987. In an attempt to
alleviate the problem a number of programs to reach the rural poor and to
increase their incomes have been initiated by GOB. These include Food for
Work (FFW) and Rural Works Programs (RWP); programs of Bangladesh Small and
Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) and Bangladesh Handloom Board (BHB),
the work of many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs); and special programs
under BRDB.
2.38    Rural Works and Food for Work programs involve an expenditure of
about US$100 M annually and generate about 90 M person days of employment
and undertake the construction of productive physical infrastructure such as
flood control embankments, rural roads and drainage channels. The quality
of works is generally not good, especially under FFW which is often treated
as a welfare program. RWP operates through the Thana Plan Book, which
contains a phased 10 year plan for high priority infrastructure development
and include detailed maps showing location of existing structures, flooding
levels, drainage flows and proposed developments. Virtually all thanas have
a Plan Book but many have not been updated since they were first dlrawn up in
the sixties.
2.39    The Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (]3SCIC)
helps develop entrepreneurship in rural industries such as carpet weaving,
cottage industries and workshops. For this purpose BSCIC has established 20
industrial estates, limited thana level extension services, and a training
center in Dhaka. It has completed special rural industry surveys in three
districts. A BSCIC-s subsidiary, the Bangladesh Handicraft Marketing Cor-
poration (BHMC) undertakes domestic as well as export sales of handicrafts.
The Bangladesh Handloom Board (BHB) promotes the local handloom industry by
providing training to a member of a loom owning family, and operat:ing a yarn
distribution system. At 17 special weavers' centers, it now provides input
and marketing support to about 100,000 weavers.
1/ This compares with the SFYP target to absorb 39% of the incremental
labor force in crop production, 23% in non-crop agriculture, 12% in
small scale rural industries, and the remaining 26% in other sectors.



-19-
2.40    Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) have been assisting the rural
poor of Bangladesh since independence. Small but successful programs have
been carried out by Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC),
Proshikha, Grameen Bank, and Small Farmers Development Project (SEDP) of
FAO. Their activities are detailed in Annex 1, Tables 12 and 13, and
salient facts are shown below:

/a  Since inception of each program; thus figure is biased towards older ones
/b  GBP policy allows loans to remain current provided some repayments,
even if partial, are being made and thus its recovery is overstated.
The NGOs have focussed their credit program on landless laborers, marginal
farmers and disadvantaged women with simple activities such as beef fatten-
ing (20%); rickshaw pulling (11%); paddy husking (22%); oil milling (4%);
weaving (6%); pond fisheries (2%), irrigation assets (2%); and others (33%).
About 37% of the beneficiaries are women. NGO's programs have not
encouraged formal grouping of beneficiaries but informal groups of people
involved in similar activities are established and members are encouraged to
save systematically at weekly meetings. NGOs get no financial support from
GOB, except in the case of GBP for which Bangladesh Bank and NCBs bear the
cost of promotion, motivation and loan supervision. In FY82 these amounted
to roughly Tk 4 M or 20% of loans outstanding.
2.41    BRDB activities to assist the rural poor are also of recent origin
even though in the sixties a Special Cooperative Federation (SCF) was set up
in Comilla TCCA to cater to the landless and other occupational groups. The
SCF supported 24 agro-based as well as non-farm activities for these groups
and about 100 primary societies with a total membership of about 6,345 are
still operating under the SCF. BRDB started its programs to assist the
rural poor only in 1977. By 1982, it had established about 2,500 special
cooperatives for the landless with a total membership of 69,000. BRDB also
started in 1979 a special program for promoting rural women's cooperatives
under IDA supported Population Planning and Health Project (Cr. 921-BD). So



-20-
far about 100 such cooperatives have been financed and a recent survey has
shown that 15% of their members depend upon wage employment as the primary
source of income. Activities supported under BRDB programs are similar to
those discussed earlier. Major problems faced in the implementation of
these programs of BRDB have been delays in the registration of new
societies, delays in the flow of credit, training and extension support and
a lack of management focus in BRDB to implement a more extensive program.
2.42    For the design of successful programs for the rural poor some useful
lessons have been learnt from the pilot projects undertaken so far. These
are that:
(a) a group approach which brings together the rural poor with similar
socio-economic background into separately organized productive units
is necessary for dealing with the established rural power structure
and for ensuring adequate supply of inputs and services;
(b) there exist a number of traditional rural occupations which can
provide income earning opportunities for which the necessary skills
are already available with potential beneficiaries;
(c) availability of institutional credit at unsubsidized rates is essen-
tial for the rural poor to undertake productive activities and high
repayment rates can be achieved for credit given to landless groups,
under adequate technical guidance;
(d) training for the catalysts as well as group leaders is essential
to give them the necessary skills to deal with the rural poor, and
build up their confidence;
(e) design of such a program needs to be light on planning and strong on
evaluation to allow innovation and adjustments based on experience
of implementation; and that the beneficiaries need to have con-
siderable say in the choice of activities to be undertaken; and
(f) such a program can make effective contribution to help landless
women, who have generally been left out of the development process.
D. IDA Operations in Agriculture and Rural Development
2.43    Since independence in 1971 until March 1983, the Bank has assisted
agricultural development in Bangladesh with 20 credits for projects in the
agricultural sector and two fertilizer import credits. Total lending for
agriculture over this period amounts to about US$450 M, or 20% of total IDA
lending to Bangladesh.
2.44    The main thrust of GOB's SFYP, and in particular of the MTFPP, is
strongly endorsed by IDA. This is reflected in the composition of IDA's



-21-
lending program which provides strong support for achieving the objectives
of MTFPP, particularly in the areas of irrigation and drainage and flood
control. These projects are:
(a) Low Lift Pump Project (Cr. 990-BD);
(b) Hand Tubewells Project (Cr. 1140-BD);
(c) Agricultural Credit Project (Cr. 1147-BD);
(d) Deep Tubewells II Project (Cr. 1287-BD);
(e) Drainage and Flood Control I Project (Cr. 864-BD);
(f) Small Scale Drainage and Flood Control Project (Cr.955-BD); and
(g) Drainage and Flood Control II Project (Cr. 1194-BD).
Preparation is underway on a Drainage and Flood Control III Project and a
WDB Sector Credit.
2.45    As recognized in GOB's overall strategy, rural institutions must be
developed to enable Bangladesh's predominantly small farmers and landless
peasants to be provided with inputs, credit and income generating oppor-
tunities and to be organized into groups for the effective utilization of
irrigation equipment. The nearly complete RD-I Project 1/ and this proposed
second project are designed to support this institutional development
effort.
2.46    The First Rural Development Project, Cr. 631-BD (RD-I) was financed
in 1976 to test the replicability of the Comilla's TCCA/KSS approach in
seven selected thanas in two districts in northern Bangladesh. After an
encouraging start'on the training of field staff, and reorganization of
existing KSS into the Comilla type TCCA/KSS by rescheduling of old debts of
these KSS and other preparatory work, the supply of inputs like irrigation
equipment, fertilizers and technical advice to the project's TCCA ran into
serious problems. For example, procurement of minor irrigation equipment
was delayed for three years due to BADC's inability to follow the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Other inputs, which were not financed directly
under the project, were also in short supply and priority was not given by
BADC to the project area. As a result, the only service available to
farmers for the first three years under RD-I was short term (ST) credit
which was of use basically only to larger farmers who already had irrigation
facilities. Thus, KSS membership did not expand in the project area.
Morale of field staff declined rapidly, along with their creditability with
the newly established KSS. Resentment built up further since farmers in the
project area, while getting no services from the project, had to pay inter-
est at 17.5% for ST credit, while GOB's SACP, operation of which was
excluded from the project area, charged interest at only 12%. Thus, except
for the project's rural works program, there was little physical evidence of
1/ The project is expected to be complete by June 1983.



-22-
the usefulness of the project and the TCCA/KSS concept came to be ques-
tioned. Project implementation began to pick up, however, in 1980 when GOB
and IDA took a number of steps:
(a)  a core program of minor irrigation, TCCA/KSS management, credit,
completion of rural works and fisheries was agreed for concentrated
attention;
(b)  an Executive Director was appointed after a gap of 18 months and
RD-I finances were delinked from other BRDB activities;
(c)  monthly thana action plans for the core program were prepared and
monitored during intensive field supervision by the Bank's Resident
Mission to Bangladesh (RMB);
(d)  a financial incentive system for TCCA staff, based on a quarterly
evaluation of TCCA/KSS, was introduced;
(e)  a system for classifying KSS according to performance criteria, and
supplying the limited minor irrigation equipment and other services
to the best KSS, was introduced; and
(f)  procurement of STWs and LLPs, following a farmer choice system, was
introduced.
2.47    By early 1981, the project's performance had improved noticeably.
Disbursements of credit to eligible KSS and farmers increased to Tk 13 M
from Tk 2 M in FY79, while the number of borrowers owning less than two
acres increased to 76% from 57% in 1978. Credit recovery of 85% against
demand was achieved. Two of the seven TCCAs achieved a level of accumulated
savings that exceeded their annual ST loans; 110 landless fishery coopera-
tives were organized and made operational; and a pilot project for improving
utilization of DTWs was successfully undertaken. Sale of 5,000 HTWs, all
available STWs (730), and DTWs (90) was completed. Training programs for
KSS managers and TCCA staff were revitalized and the backlogs of audits and
elections for the managing committee for all  A  and  B' class KSS were
cleared. By the original closing date (June 1982), the US$16 M project was
basically complete at a cost saving of US$5 M, a part of which has since
been allocated to finance 250 DTWs for the 1,000 KSS located in Mymensingh
District, where it was found during implementation, that the plan to use STW
was not feasible. The current status of RD-I activities is summarized in
Table 1, Annex 1. Problems of audit backlogs and delays in registration of
landless BSS have surfaced. In addition, in Mymensingh, where irrigation
development has been slow due to delays in procurement of DTW, performance
of KSS has not been as good as in Bogra.
2.48    Important lessons have been learnt from RD-I.  The first orLe is that
if the principal objective is to create an institution to provide farmers,



-23-
and in particular small farmers, with the means to adopt new technology and
undertake efficient irrigation development, it is counter productive to
package investments which are not directly relevant to the basic program, in
this case, establishing viable TCCA/KSS. Attempts to implement a wide range
of activities divert the attention of project staff from the priority task
of institutional development. The second unsatisfactory aspect of RD-I
design, which appears common to similar projects financed by other donors is
the concentration on a relatively few thanas. This is unsatisfactory for
two reasons, because operation of two programs -- project and nonproject --
is confusing to district officials because of the administrative problems
involved; and further confining an intensive development program to a few
favored thanas creates local tensions which in turn adversely affect
implementation. Not least, other GOB departments expected to provide serv-
ices to projects, in these cases directed by BRDB, seem to have found it
difficult to equate the priority they had been expected to provide such
areas with their responsibilities to provide such services nationwide.
Finally, it is evident from the experience of RD-I that institutional
development cannot take place in the absence of an assured supply of inputs
and services to farmers. The strong initial farmer response to RD-I turned
into antagonism as BADC failed to complete the procurement of STWs under
ICB. Only when the farmer choice system (para 4.04) was introduced could
the procurement be completed and the institutional development efforts
revived. Even now, the poor performance of TCCA/KSS in the District of
Mymensingh is directly attributable to the failure of BADC to complete the
procurement of DTWs, which alone are feasible for the TCCA located in these
thanas. The proposed Second Rural Development Project appraised in this
report takes into account these experiences.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01    The primary objective of the Second Rural Development Project
(RD-II) would be to strengthen and expand the TCCA/KSS cooperative system
and improve the capability and performance of its promotional agency BRDB.
The project would streamline procedures for (a) the purchase by TCCA of
irrigation equipment, and (b) for the distribution of credit by Sornali Bank
to the TCCA. Efforts would also be made to diversify the activities of a
limited number of selected TCCA into crop and input marketing. Finally, the
project would assist BRDB in providing a special package of inputs through
TCCA for members, including women, of the special cooperatives (Bittaheen
Samabaya Samity - BSS) of the rural poor. About 90 new TCCA, 8,000 new KSS
and 3,000 new BSS 1/ are expected to be formed during the project's four
1/  The term  BSS' includes the separate cooperatives for women - or MSS.



-24-
year implementation period. The 210 existing TCCA would focus their atten-
tion on the 15,000  A' and  B' class KSS, but attempt also to upgrade the
7,000 KSS which have yet to reach these standards.
B. Project Area
3.02    With the exceptions set out below, all TCCA would be eligible to
participate in the project. Due to ongoing and proposed projects which are
assisting TCCA in the districts of Kushtia, Pabna and Raishahi (the ADB
financed Northwest Development Project); Jessore and Faridpur (the IFAD
financed Southwest Rural Development Project); Noakhali (the Danish Govern-
ment financed Noakhali Integrated Rural Development Project); and the Chit-
tagong Hill Tracts (the ADB financed Chittagong Hill Tracts Development
Project), it is anticipated that TCCA in the seven districts covered by
these projects would not draw on the inputs and services made available
under RD-II. However, it is expected that the institutional arrangements
employed in the seven districts would be similar to those used under RD-II
which themselves are consistent with the recommendations of the JoiLnt Review
of IRDP. Because of BRDB-s currently limited implementation capacity the
proposed rural poor and marketing components would be initially concentrated
in six districts. Eligibility criteria for the participation of individual
TCCA in project activities would take account of their needs, management
capacity and availability of complementary infrastructure and other
facilities. Assurances have been obtained that these criteria (Schedule B)
would be followed. Other BRDB programs should not be affected adversely by
RD-II; on the contrary, the strengthening of BRDB and the TCCA under the
project should facilitate the implementation of a number of project:s in
which BRDB is involved, including some financed by IDA.
C. Project Components
3.03    The principal components of the project would be:
(a)  provision of medium term (MT) credit to TCCA/KSS members for the
purchase of about 30,000 STW, 2,000 LLP, 2,300 tool kits, a,nd 2,300
bicycles;
(b) expansion of an ongoing Irrigation Management Program (IMP) to cover
about 4,400 DTW and 1,100 LLP/STW clusters; 1/
(c) provision of medium term (MT) credit to about 3,000 TCCA/BSS, under
a Rural Poor Program, for productive activities such as beef fatten-
ing, weaving, handicrafts, and pond fisheries;
1/ Where STW or LLP are employed in batteries and thus command a substan-
tial potentially irrigable area.



-25-
(d)  provision of short term (ST) credit to TCCA/KSS members for crop
production;
(e)  implementation of a TCCA Crop and Input Marketing Program in a
limited number of TCCA;
(f)  construction of basic thana facilities, the Thana Training and
Development Center (TTDC), at 20 thanas where these have yet to be
provided by GOB;
(g)  construction of essential TCCA office facilities, at 100 thanas and
the residential accommodation required for the staff of GOB agencies
who would be essential for project activities in these thanas;
(h)  strengthening BRDB  and the audit capacity of the Registrar of
Cooperatives by the appointment of additional staff and the provi-
sion of vehicles and office equipment;
Mi)  training of BRDB staff, Cooperative Department auditors,
TCCA/KSS/BSS staff and members, and thana irrigation teams in the
wide range of activities essential to the success of the project.
This component would include the construction of five new Thana
Training Units and additional classrooms and staff accommodation at
the Rural Development Training Institute (RDTI) at Sylhet; and
(j)  technical assistance required for the Rural Poor Program, marketing,
training, audit and accounts, and monitoring and evaluation - a
total of 240 man months.
D. Detailed Features
3.04    Purchase of STW and LLP (Annex 3, Table 2):  National demand of the
TCCA/KSS system for STW is estimated conservatively at 15,000 per annum and
that for LLPs at 1,500. The project would finance the purchase by eligible
KSS on MT credit provided by TCCA, of 30,000 STW and 3,000 one-cusec LLPS.
Installed units which would be mostly diesel engine driven would cost about
Tk 33,000 for a STW and Tk 27,000 for a LLP. The balance of the TCCA demand
for STW would be met from sources such as the IDA financed Agricultural
Credit Project (Cr. 1147-BD) and projects financed by other sources. The
TCCA will also require HTW and DTW, but this demand should be met fully by
ongoing IDA and other donor financed operations.  By 1987, 90% of  A  and
'B class KSS are expected to have some irrigation facilities compared to
only 45% now. Project STW and LLP together with spare parts equivalent to
at least 5% of the value of the engines would be imported, retailed,
installed and serviced by private dealers. TCCA would however have the
option to purchase STWs in bulk from dealers and install these using private
drilling contractors. Credit would also be made available to private



-26-
mechanics sponsored by TCCA, for purchase of simple toolboxes and bicycles.
Based on irrigation equipment likely to be in operation, it is estimated
that 2,300 such private mechanics would be required. These mechanics would
operate as mobile private repairmen and would be suitably trained (para
3.23). Lending terms and conditions are specified in Schedule A. For this
MT credit component to function smoothly, a number of improvements would be
required in the credit mechanism used by BB, Sonali BAnk and TCCA. These
are discussed in detail in Schedule C.
Irrigation Management Program (IMP) (Annex 3, Tables 3 and 4)
3.05    The project would meet the cost of the expansion of IMP from its
present coverage of 430 DTW/LLP units (para 2.13) to about 5,500 DTW and
STW/LLP clusters. The expansion would require (a) strengthening of the
irrigation faculty at the Rural Development Academy, Bogra; (b) training of
thana level teams; and (c) training of irrigation group leaders.
3.06    About 300 thana irrigation teams, each consisting of a BADC Section
Officer, TCCA Deputy Project Officer, Thana Extension Officer and Thana
Overseer would be trained under the project at RDA, Bogra. Funds would be
provided under this component to complete the furnishing of RDA trainee
hostel.  The FAO/UNDP's command area development team at Bogra would con-
tinue as now to assist RDA's irrigation management faculty in this work.
It is expected that all positions already approved for the irrigation
faculty at RDA would be filled by December 1983. Details of the training
program are discussed in para 3.22.
3.07    DTW schemes into which IMP has already been introduced have been
studies in detail by the Bangladesh Agricultural University. These studies
have shown that further improvements in the efficiency of irrigation can be
achieved on all existing IMP units. Generally, improved compaction of
earthen irrigation channels can result in decline of heavy seepage losses,
but special canal lining may also be justified on lighter soils or where the
command area has a topography which allows only poor embankment stability.
An allocation of US$0.5 M would be provided (as MT credit) under the project
for KSS who wish to undertake improved canal construction or lining.
3.08    Although under IMP the specific responsibilities of the thana staff
of DEM, BADC and BRDB have now been clearly defined, GOB is yet to act on
the recommendation of the Minor Irrigation Review, to formally establish
these responsibilities for the overall development of DTW/LLP command areas.
GOB has constituted a National Committee to consider proposals covering the
roles of key agencies and would formally establish their responsibilities by
October 31, 1983.



-27-
Rural Poor Program (Annex 3, Tables 6, 7, and 8)
3.09    The project would provide MT credit for productive economic.
activities to rural poor organized as BSS. Because of BRDB-s experience in
rural poor programs is limited, this project component would be small in
scale and flexible in design to allow modification as experience dictates.
3.10    The rural poor component would be implemented to start with in the
six districts of Bogra, Mymensingh, Jamalpur, Khulna, Dinajpur and Barisal
in which there are no similar activities ongoing or planned. Socio-economic
data of these six districts are in Annex 1, Table 13. Four of the districts
have a landless population above the national average while in the other two
this is equal to the national average. Only about 3% of the 25,000 villages
in these six districts have BSS, mostly in Bogra and Mymensingh where RD-I
is located. Their membership is about 21,000. Of the 2,900 new Bittaheen
Samabaya Samities (BSSs) to be formed under the project, about 400 would be
exclusively for women. Membership of the BSS would be limited as now to
those owning less than 0.5 ac of land and earning their basic livelihood
from casual labor. By year 4, BSS membership is expected to reach about
120,000 men and 9,000 women.
3.11    The major activities to be supported under the Rural Poor Program
are discussed in detail in Annex 3, Appendix 1. Pond fisheries would
involve the formation of BSS around ponds leased from GOB, excavation of the
derelict pond using funds in the form of MT credit from the project, pur-
chase of fish fries from GOB operated hatcheries or private sources and
marketing of the catch in local markets. Beef fattening would involve
purchase under credit of young calves, grazing and some supplement feeding,
and sale of mature cattle. Credit would also be available for purchase of
cows for milk production. A cattle insurance program has been introduced by
BRDB with the national insurance company and this would operate for all
project financed animals. Credit for weaving would be for purchase of semi
automatic looms and for working capital. BSS would link up with BHB's yarn
distribution centers for input supply and marketing support. Rickshaws
would be financed for members of BSS and a self insurance scheme within each
TCCA would cover the financial risk in case the rickshaw gets seriously
damaged. Cane and bamboo work would be promoted by financing credit for
working capital which is the major constraint. Pottery, a traditional
activity, would be supported under the project by funds for the purchase of
improved kilns and for working capital. BSCIC would provide extension and
training support to the BSS undertaking pottery activity. Other activities



-28-
like carpentry, oil milling or setting up biogas units 1/ would be included
should there be a demand for these.
3.12    The number of borrowers for various activities is roughly estimated
as follows:
Number of Borrowers
Activities                      Year 1   Year 2   Year 3   Year 4    Total
Pond Fisheries                         20        80       100      100       300
Beef Fattening                      3,000    9,000   12,500   15,000   39,500
Livestock for Milk Production         400       600    1,500    1,500    4,000
Weaving                               300       600      800    1,500    3,200
Rickshaw Pulling                      350       850      850    1,000    3,050
Cane and Bamboo Work                  200       400      400       500    1,500

Others to be identified               250       350      800    1,000    2,400
Total                               4,580   11,980   17,150   20,800   54,510
Incremental ST Credit for Crop Production
3.13    Essential to the success of the TCCA/KSS system is an adequate and
assured supply of short term credit for crop production. Failure to provide
such a supply (para 2.23) has been a serious constraint to TCCA/KSS develop-
ment in the past. With the expanding use of irrigation equipment by KSS and
the increasing efficiency of the use of this equipment under IMP, the demand
for ST credit will increase significantly. This demand will be enhanced by
the expected rise in prices of agricultural inputs and the increase in per
acre crop credit ceilings. For a typical 'A' and 'B' class KSS the annual
flow of ST credit is expected to increase from a FY82 figure of Tk 11,000 to
Tk 24,400 in FY83 as a result of higher ceilings; and then grow to Tk 42,000
over the following four years. KSS participating in IMP are expected to use
Tk 80,600 of ST credit annually. It is expected that the number of 'A' and
'B' class KSS with irrigation facilities will increase from 45% to 90% by
1987; and about 60% of 'A' and 'B' class KSS would be eligible to borrow as
now. The total flow of ST credit through the TCCAs in the 13 districts of
the project would increase from an estimated Tk 390 M in FY83 to Tk 2,042 M
in FY87. The incremental requirement under the project is estimated at
Tk 1,526 M (Annex 2, Table 5). Sonali Bank would be unable to meet this
demand from its own internal resources because of demands from other GOB
programs, and BB would provide 90% refinance for this program (para 4.03).
1/ Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) is
developing with BRDB a program to popularize biogas unit in rural areas
through cooperatives.



-29-
Marketing (Annex 3, Table 9)
3.14    The project would provide MT credit to TCCA for the construction of
about 10 produce marketing godowns and about 15 fertilizer godowns each of
200 tons capacity, and of an existing low-cost design. A set of moisture
testing and weighing equipment would be allocated for the 20 TCCAs expected
to participate in the crop marketing program, about half of which now have a
godown. The project's marketing activities would be built on the experience
of ongoing pilot projects (para 2.35). The ongoing FAO/UNDP fertilizer
marketing project would provide training and logistic support to the TCCA
that would take up fertilizer marketing. The FAO/UNDP project is due to
close on June 30, 1983, and GOB has sought an extension of the project.
Thana Civil Works (Annex 3, Table 14)
3.15    TTDCs have yet to be built or completed at about 20 thanas in the 13
districts of the project. These would be built under the project, using
existing standard designs (para 2.33).
3.16    TCCA offices with a gross space of 2,750 sq. ft. each would be built
for about 100 TCCA. They would be built to standard designs used in the
past and include a training room of about 575 sq. ft. To accommodate the
key TCCA staff (para 2.19) 200 twin quarters would also be built under the
project. Both the TCCA office and staff quarters would be built within the
TTDC complex where land would be readily available.
Strengthening of BRDB (Annex 3, Table 15)
3.17    All 13 BRDB district offices (para 2.19) would be strengthened with
the addition of a Deputy Project Director (DPD). In addition, for all TCCAs
taking up the IMP or rural poor programs, an additional Deputy Project
Officer would be appointed for each of the programs. For the 90 new TCCA
expected to be established under the project, BRDB would recruit TPOs, DPOs
and accountants. The cost of these incremental staff (13 DPDs, 80 TPOs, 400
DPOs, and 90 accountants) would be included in the project (Annex 3,
Table 15). TCCA which decide to expand their marketing operations or diver-
sify into other activities would need additional staff and would recruit
these on their own account. Vehicles provided under the project for BRDB
district offices would include 13 audio visual vans, 16 jeeps, about 790
motorcycles and 6,100 bicycles. These estimates of replacement needs are
based on an agewise inventory of BRDB vehicles. Motorcycles and bicycles
would be sold to BRDB and TCCA staff on a hire-purchase basis following the
pattern developed under the Extension and Research Project II (Credit
1215-BD). Essential furniture and equipment for both new and existing TCCA
would be provided, including about 200 duplicating machines and 400
typewriters.



-30-
Strengthening of RCS Audit (Annex 3, Tables 12 and 13)
3.18    The project would finance the setting up, under the RCS, of a wing
exclusively responsible for auditing the accounts of TCCA/KSS/BSS. Formal
GOB approval for the establishment of this separate section, with staffing
levels satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of effectiveness. Incremen-
tal staff totalling 390 (1 Joint Registrar, 15 Deputy Registrars, 44 Assis-
tant Registrars and 330 Audit Inspectors) would be provided. In total, it
is estimated that by year 4 about 650 audit inspectors would be working
exclusively on the audit of KSS/BSS. Vehicles (15 jeeps, 42 motorcycles and
650 bicycles) would be provided for this division as would office equipment.
The project would also provide funds for RCS to employ private firms to
undertake audit of TCCA. For RCS Comilla Cooperative College where the
audit staff are trained (para 3.28), the project would provide one minibus
and other essential equipment.
Training (Annex 2, Tables 2, 3 and 4; Annex 3, Tables 4, 5, 7, 10, li and 13)
3.19    Project training programs would focus on cooperative management,
accounts, credit procedures, irrigation management, operations of tlhe rural
poor program, crop, fertilizer marketing and audit. Details of the topics
to be covered under various training programs are in the project file (Annex
7). The volume of the project's total training program (Annex 2, Table 2)
is estimated at 3.2 M trainee days, almost 85% of this is at farmer,tKSS
level.
3.20    Project training would be conducted at the locations shown below:
Institution    Type of Trainee               Type of Training
RDTI, Sylhet   BRDB Staff           Pre-service and in-service training in
cooperative management, accounting,
credit procedures and marketing.
RDA, Bogra     BRDB Staff; Thana   Special innovative programs, like IMP
Irrigation Teams    and Rural Poor.
TTUs (17)      TCCA Staff, KSS      In-service training in TCCA activities,
Managers             credit procedures, loan supervision, BSS
promotion.
TTDC (300)     Farmers and KSS      Cooperative management, credit procedures,
Managers             IMP, marketing.
CCC            Audit                Audit training.
3.21    The project would provide classroom buildings (16,500 sq. ft.), 18
staff quarters (of 550 sq. ft. each) and other essential works to complete



,-31-
the facilities at RDTI. Two vehicles, training equipment and funds for
books at the RDTI library would be included. To ensure that financial
constraints do not hold back the execution of essential BRDB staff training,
the project would include the incremental operating costs of RDTI. Expected
utilization of RDTI facilities for RD-II purposes would be about 80%.
3.22    For IMP (Annex 3, Table 4), (para 3.06), RDA, Bogra would organize
annually 10 courses of 4-week duration. An IMP training manual has been
prepared; this is based on training materials already produced by RDA and
BRDB's training materials production unit. It is expected that a contract
satisfactory to IDA between BRDB and RDA for the latter to undertake the IMP
training would be executed by December 1983.
3.23    Training of irrigation group leaders would be organized by the
concerned TCCA with costs funded under the project. Participants would
consist of one KSS manager, six irrigation block leaders and the group's
pump operator. Each group would be given assistance in improved group
management, budgeting, credit procedures, and water sharing. Training of
private mechanics (Annex 3, Table 5) would be done by BADC and private
dealers of engines on contract with BRDB. A special 8-month training
program in three phases would be undertaken (see project file for details).
GOB would prepare for IDA review a redraft of the agreement, which was
reviewed during negotiations, between BRDB and BADC for the latter's assis-
tance for this component by October 31, 1983.
3.24    Rural poor training (Annex 3, Table 7) would consist of training for
(a) TCCA promotional staff; (b) BSS chairpersons and managers; and (c) skill
training where necessary. Training of TCCA staff would focus on how to
motivate the disadvantaged people to form BSS, create an attitude of mutual
trust and build up an absorption capacity for project activities. A
quarterly refresher course would be organized, at which cooperative leaders,
participants and BRDB staff would also review program implementation. Train-
ing courses for this program would be designed by BRDB's Director for the
Rural Poor Program. Special training for skill development in cottage
industry and handlooms would be undertaken by institutions like BSCIC, BHB
and Bangladesh Sericulture Board as well as by willing NGOs as appropriate
under contract with BRDB. BRDB has identified the assistance needed from
GOB's technical agencies as well as NGOs willing to work with BRDB in this
program. BRDB would, based on the draft reviewed during negotiations, enter
into a contract with BSCIC for the latter's assistance for this compDnent.
A redraft of the agreement would be submitted for IDA review by October 31,
1983. Training needs for traditional activities like beef fattening, live-
stock and pond fisheries would be carried out through normal GOB extension
services.
3.25    In-service training of TCCA staff (Annex 3, Table 11) would be done
in the field using the 12 Thana Training Units (TTUs) built under Cr.
621-BD. These units have residential and classroom facilities for 30, and



-32-
even though all are not yet complete, they have been useful in organizing
the IMP and Mukta Training in the RD-I thanas. Once completed in June 1983,
they would be made fully operational under the project by the appointment of
a training officer and three essential supporting staff at each TTU. Five
additional TTUs would be built to the same design to ensure that each dis-
trict office has at least one such facility at its command. Training would
focus on improving the skills of TCCA staff for undertaking TCCA activities.
New training programs with supporting training materials for these TTUs
would be designed by BRDB. Incremental operating costs estimated at
Tk 25,000 per unit annually and allowances for trainees would be included.
Utilization of TTU facilities is expected to be at least 75%.
3.26    Training of KSS managers and members (Annex 3, Table 11) would be
undertaken at the thana using the training hall of the TTDC or the TlCCAs'
own training room. Training would be in group sizes not exceeding 30 and
duration would vary from five days for new KSS manager's orientation course
to 3 days for a new Chairman. KSS managers during their weekly visist to
the TCCA to deposit savings, collect loans and settle membership problems,
would participate in a 2-hour training sessions. At this session KSS
managers would be trained in maintaining accounts and preparing credit
applications.
3.27    Training of -model' farmers - a farmer selected for a period of one
year by the KSS to bring to the village new ideas and techniques - would be
restructured. Fortnightly training would be replaced by three days of
training in four sessions before the start of each crop season. DEM staff
would assist with this training and 'model' farmers from -A- class KSS would
be among the 'contact' farmers visited by the extension staff.
3.28    Training of RCS staff (Annex 3, Table 13) who audit the TCCA/KSS/BSS
would be undertaken at CCC which would design and execute special 60-day
courses for this purpose. The cost of this training would be included in
the project. The new audit manual (draft is in the project file) would be
used for training purposes.
3.29    Finally, the recently established BRDB's training materials produc-
tion unit, which is assisted by a UK grant for equipment and technical
assistance, would be provided with funds under the project for producing
training material relevant to BRDB's program in the form of posters, book-
lets, manuals, slides and short training films (Annex 3, Table 10).
Technical Assistance (Annex 3, Table 16)
3.30    The project is estimated to require 240 man months of technical
assistance which would be funded by the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), Overseas Development Administration (ODA), and UNDP. Outline
terms of reference for the various specialist assistance are in the project
file (Annex 7). Estimated cost per man month is $12,000 for foreign



-33-
exports. It is expected that Bangladeshi expertise would be available for
about 80 man months of the total, thus bringing the average cost to about
US$8,500. Specialists would work with BRDB Directors according to their
area of activity, except for the specialist on audit who would spend a part
of his time with RCS. Technical assistance would be needed for:
(a) Marketing (36 man months): The technical assistance needs of the
project-s fertilizer marketing activities would be provided by an
extension of the ongoing FAO/UNDP fertilizer project. However, crop
marketing program would require assistance for developing software
package for the marketing of other crops and for further market
development for the Mukta program.
(b) Training (48 man months): The project would provide two types of
specialist assistance, expertise in training methodology and in
training planning. The expert on training methodology would con-
centrate on building up the capability of RDTI and TTUs while the
one on training planning would focus on BRDB staff training and
development needs.
(c) Rural Poor Program (60 man months): Technical assistance would be
required for the preparation of special surveys for districts in
which these activities would be implemented. First, in each dis-
trict an inventory would be made of potentially gainful employment
opportunities, an assessment of existing capabilities, potentiality
and identification of the skill training and special requirements
for services would be made (30 man months). Secondly, the prepara-
tion of detailed syllabus and teaching aids for training BRDB/TCCA
staff, BSS leaders and members (12 man months). Thirdly, periodic
field review of the project activities to identify implementation
constraints and needed modifications in the project approach (18 man
months).
(d) Evaluation (72 man months): Technical assistance would be required
for both ex-post evaluation of the project at completion, and for
mid term and special studies to monitor and evaluate selected
aspects of project implementation.
(e) Audit (24 man months): Technical assistance would be necessary for
updating the TCCA accounts manual and the RCS audit manual as well
as for designing training program at RDTI for TCCA accountants and
at the Cooperative College Comilla for RCS auditors.

IV. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING AND CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS
A. Project Costs and Financing
4.01    Total project costs are estimated at US$177 M (Tk 4,070 M) including
duties and taxes estimated at US$8.4 M (Tk 192 M). The foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$76.1 M (Tk 1,750 M), representing 43% of total
project costs. Base cost estimates are expressed in mid-1983 prices.
Physical contingencies and contingencies included for expected price escala-
tion over the four year project period amount to 25% of total base costs.
Physical contingencies have been estimated at 10% of civil works costs, and
5% of all other costs, except minor irrigation equipment and incremental
ST credit for which no physical contingencies have been provided. Price
contingencies are based on expected price inflation: for foreign costs 7.5%
annually, and for local costs 13% in 1983184, 11% in 1984/85 and 10%
annually for 1985/86 through 1986/87. Details of cost estimates are in

The proposed IDA credit of US$100 M would cover 59% of total project cost
net of duties and taxes (US$168.6 M). IDA financing would contribute to all
project components except rural poor program, strengthening of audit,
cooperative training and technical assistance. Canadian grant aid (CIDA) of
about US$17.2 M is armarked to finance the rural poor program, the private
mechanics program - a part of the minor irrigation program involving the
rural poor, and the related technical assistance. British grant aid (ODA)
of about US$10.5 M would contribute to three of the project com-
ponents--strengthening of audit, cooperative training, and the related
technical assistance. UNDP would contribute US$1.6 M to the remaining
technical assistance program not covered either by CIDA or ODA. Thus for-
eign aid would total US$129.3 M and cover about 77% of total project cost,
net of duties and taxes. It would finance all foreign expenditure (lJS$76.1
M) and about 58% of the local cost (US$92.5 M). The execution of the
financing agreements with the co-financiers would be a condition of effec-
tiveness.  The balance of project cost financing would be covered by
beneficiaries: KSS/BSS members and TCCA - US$6.0 M; Sonali Bank - US$12.1 M;
and GOB and BB together - US$21.2 M; as well as duties and taxes - US$8.4 M
by GOB.
4.03      KSS members would contribute 10% to the estimated cost of 'STW and
LLP in the form of cash downpayment, the remaining 90% would be financed by
a medium term loan extended by the Sonali Bank. Sonali Bank contribution
estimated at 10% of the MT loan would come from its own resources, the
remaining 90% would be refinanced by BB, which in turn would be refirianced
by GOB/IDA (see details in para 4.13). For crop production, KSS members'
entire requirements would be financed by a ST loan extended by the Sonali
Bank. BB would refinance 90% of the loans provided by SB, which in turn
would be refinanced by GOB/IDA. Due to the innovative nature of the rural
poor program, and Sonali Bank's as well as BRDB's limited experience in



-36-
financing this, BB refinance for BSS activities, which in turn would be
refinanced by GOB/CIDA, would be for 100% of SB's lending. BSS members'
contribution would range from 5-10% of their total investment. GOB would
execute a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with BB under which it would on-lend
US$95 M equivalet to BB on terms and conditions described in Schedule A.
Refinancing of SB, on terms and conditions described in Schedule A, would be
subject to the completion of a Participation Agrement between BB and SB. It
would be a condition of effectiveness that both agreements were satisfactory
to IDA and had been properly executed. GOB's contribution for the remnaining
local costs and duties and taxes would be made available to the implementing
agencies in the form of budgetary allocations. It would be a condition of
effectiveness that a Project Proforma (PP) satisfactory to IDA had been
approved by GOB.
B. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
4.04    Equipment:  Procurement by individuals, groups and KSS, would
involve relatively small investments. Typical items would be STW and LLP,
pipes and screens, toolboxes, bicycles, and locally made simple equipmaent
for the various activities under the rural poor program. For STW and LLP
engines (US$14.6 M) there are a number of approved makes of all imported
ones, which have been found to be appropriate for operation in Bangladesh
and whose dealers are setting up retail and maintenance networks. STW and
LLP engines would be procured by private dealers based on farmers' demiand
for their model and at their full cost price including transport and han-
dling margins. GOB would issue licenses, valid for two to three months, for
the import of any of the eight approved engines by importers at their own
risk for sale to project farmers. Under Cr. 1147-BD, GOB has undertaken to
allow import of other engines which are appropriate for operation in
Bangladesh conditions, and for which importers have developed acceptable
plans for a repair and service network. This would be confirmed at nego-
tiations. To ensure that the implementation of the irrigation program is
off to an early start, it would be a condition of effectiveness that :Lmport
licenses had been issued for the import of at least 5,000 STW/LLP engines by
private dealers. Locally manufactured centrifugal pumps (US$9.1 M), which
are coupled with the imported engines, are of good quality, there is ade-
quate competition in the local market and these would be procured by private
importers based on farmers' choice. Simple pipes and brass strainers
(US$19.0 M) would be procured by private dealers from local suppliers who
fabricate these using imported raw materials. Spares (US$2.5 M) would be
procured by the importer with the engines. Transport and drilling services
(US$8.1 M) would be provided by local contractors working with the dealers.
The remaining costs would be duties and taxes (US$4.6 M).



-37-
4.05    Civil Works:  The project-s civil works (US$15.3 M), each item of
which would be small in size (maximum US$75,000), would be widely dispersed
at 100 or more locations. This would preclude the use of ICB. Conse-
quently, these would be executed through local competitive bidding.
4.06    Other Goods and Services:  Since project vehicles would be required
immediately upon the launching of the project and because of the need for
after sales servicing facilities, project vehicles (US$0.5 M including
duties and taxes which amount to 50% of cost), would be procured by competi-
tive bidding advertised locally from all the suppliers of foreign made
vehicles and equipment who have a service network in Bangladesh and are from
member countries. Motorcycles and bicycles (US$1.6 M) would be sold to
about 7,500 GOB and TCCA staff on hire purchase. These will be procured
consistent with the preference of the people to whom such motorcycles and
bicycles are to be provided. Price quotations would be invited from all
local and foreign manufacturers who have a service network in Bangladesh and
are from member countries, and supplied to the applicants. Choices given
by them would be collated and orders placed by BRDB. Small items worth less
than US$15,000 would be purchased following prudent shopping procedures.
These would not exceed 1.0 M in aggregate. Incremental operating costs
(US$2.5 M) would consist of staff salaries and allowances for BRDB. Train-
ing would be totally local and would be arranged by BRDB at institutions
acceptable to IDA. The remaining costs would be for incremental ST credit
(US$66.3 M). Procurement of goods and services out of the funds provided by
agencies other than IDA would be subject to terms and condition agreed upon
between GOB and the concerned lending agencies.
4.07    Contract Review:  About 350 bidding packages are anticipated for
contracts let under the project, mostly for civil works which would be
handled by the Project Engineering and Construction Unit (PECU) of Public
Works Department (PWD). PECU has satisfactorily handled the procurement
of civil work for the IDA financed Foodgrain Storage II Project (Cr.
787-BD). For RD-II prior review by IDA would be restricted to civil works
and other contracts costing US$50,000 or more. This will result in prior
review of about 10% of the bidding packages covering nearly 30% of the value
of contracts.
Disbursement (Annex 4, Table 2)
4.08    Disbursements under the credit would extend over five years.  The
disbursement for the project is expected to be faster than the historical
disbursement profile for projects in Bangladesh because of (a) strong com-
mitment of GOB to the project; (b) advance action on the import of STW/LLP;
(c) use of existing designs for civil works for which land would be readily
available in TTDC; and (d) project emphasis on expansion of ongoing
programs. Disbursements would be made as follows:



-38-
(a) 90% of BB refinance to Sonali Bank for its MT lending to eligible
TCCA (i) for purchase by eligible KSS and farmers of STW and l]LP
(US$38.0 M); (ii) for construction of lined irigation canals and
control structures (US$0.30 M); and (iii) for construction of
godowns (US$0.20 M);
(b) 75% of BB refinance for Sonali Bank's incremental ST lending to
eligible TCCAs above a base to be established at the end of each FY
(US$37.5 M);
(c) 90% of the costs of all civil works contracts (US$9.0 M); 1/
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures ex-factory
and 60% of local expenditures for project vehicles and equipment
(US$1.75 M);
(e) 100% of training costs (US$2.0 M);
(f)  100%-70% 2/ of BRDB incremental staff salaries (US$1.25 M); and
(g)  Unallocated (US$10 M).
4.09    Disbursements against Category (c) and (d) would be fully docu-
mented. Disbursements against items in para 4.08 (a) and (b) will be made
against BB's certified statement of refinance provided by BB to Sonali Bank.
Disbursements against Categories (e) and (f) would be based on certified
statements of expenditures prepared by the DG of BRDB. Documents in support
of certified statements would be retained by BB and BRDB and made available
for inspection by staff of IDA supervision missions. All documents in
support of statements of expenditure and refinance would be independently
audited and audit reports would be made available to IDA.
4.10    Conditions of Disbursement would be against:
1/ Under PWD procedures, payment to a contractor is reduced by 10% of the
approved bill; this -retention' money is paid only six months after the
successful completion of the work and thus delays IDA disbursements for
approved expenditures. GOB has agreed that it would not subsequently
claim reimbursement from IDA for the retention money when it is actually
paid to the contractors. On this basis IDA disbursement rate is calcu-
lated as 90% of actual amount paid to contractors, net of retention
money.
2/ On a reducing basis with 100% for FY84 and 85, 90% for FY86, 80% for
FY87, and 70% for FY88.



-39-
-    Category a(ii) and b, that Sonali Bank had designated one Deputty
General manager to handle all aspects of its credit operations with
TCCA/KSS/BSS (para 5.07);
-    Category a(iii), that the project document for the continuation of
the UNDP/FAO Fertilizer Marketing Project had been executed (para
3.14).
4.11    Experience in Bangladesh has shown that on average there is a gap of
four to six months between the time a local expenditure is incurred, and the
time of IDA disbursement. In case of credit components, involving the
import of STW and LLP, scarce foreign exchange is tied up for as long as
nine months before the imported engines are sold to farmers and the flow of
credit is refinanced by IDA. To ensure adequate availability of foreign
exchange for imports of STW and LLP engines, a Special Account would be
established by Bangladesh Bank. To this Special Account, IDA would make an
advance contribution of US$4 M immediately upon effectiveness and thereafter
disbursements would be against statements of expenditure for MT credit
refinanced by BB. The advance would be recovered during year 4 of the
project from BB's claims for reimbursement against MT credit refinanced.
Assurance has been obtained that BB would make available the foreign
exchange needed by private dealers for the importation of the engines;
Bangladesh Bank would provide a quarterly statement of foreign exchage
released for the importation. It would be a condition of disbursement
against the advance that the Special Account had been established and proce-
dures had been agreed with IDA for its operation.
C. Credit Arrangements
4.12    Overall credit operations of the TCCA would be strengthened and
financing provided under the project for (a) medium term credit for irriga-
tion equipment (US$57.9 M); (b) incremental ST credit flowing through the
TCCA in the 13 districts of the project (US$66.3 M); (c) credit for the
rural poor program supported under the project (US$10.2 M); and (d) credit
for other activities (US$2.1 M).
4.13    All credit for TCCA would be channelled as now through the Sonali
Bank (para 2.29). Interest rates and financing levels for MT credit and ST
credit would be the same as those prevailing under recently approved IDA
Credits involving lending to TCCA. For the new component to finance income
generating activities for the rural poor, the rates would be equal to the
highest prevailing rates in the TCCA/KSS system. These interest rates would
be real in relation to the expected inflation and the margins available
would be satisfactory to ensure that TCCA can achieve financial viability
(para 7.07). The lending terms and conditions, which are spelled out in
Schedule A, would be embodied in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOB
and BB and the Participation Agreement between BB and SB (para 4.03).

4.14    Interest rates for all investments financed under the project are
1-5% above rates prevailing for similar investments when credit is chan-
nelled through institutions other than TCCA. In the past, TCCA/KSS members
have not been overly concerned about the actual interest rates charged under
a project provided inputs and services required by them are available
without cumbersome procedures. Thus, such interest rate differentials
between TCCA and other credit programs are not likely to adversely affect
the growth of credit under the project especially in view of the simplifica-
tion of procedures to be done (para 4.15). The overall level of agricul-
tural interest rates would be subject to GOB and IDA review as the recommen-
dations of the recently completed Joint Review of Agricultural Credit are
agreed and implemented. Assurance has been obtained that the interest rate
level and structure under the project would be reviewed annually to ensure
that: (a) such interest rate level and structure are consistent with recoin-
menations of the Joint Review; and (b) until such time as the recommenda-
tions of the Joint Review are implemented, interest rates to ultimate bor-
rowers remain positive in real terms and ensure the financial viability of
TCCA.
4.15    The procedures used by TCCA and KSS for their lending operaticins and
in turn for obtaining refinance from Sonali Bank, would be improved under
the project. The objective of the improvements would be to make the credit
operations more responsive to the needs of eligible farmers while maintain-
ing conditions essential for the productive use and good recovery of credit.
Three basic features of the changes would be:
(a) streamlined procedures and reduced flow of paper relating to loan
applications, sanctions and payments between TCCA and others;



-41-
(b) refinement of criteria for the eligibility of TCCA/KSS/BSS and
members; and
(c) establishment of guidelines and criteria for loan approvals in order
to reduce the need for reference to Headquarters by both Sonali Bank
branch manager and the TCCA.
Modifications in credit procedures and salient features of the different
credit operations of TCCA are detailed in Schedule C. A draft Banking Plan
incorporating the above improvements and modifications in the present lend-
ing operations of Sonali Bank and TCCA, prepared by GOB, was reviewed during
negotiations; and its approval by the Management Boards of Sonali Bank and
BRDB would be a condition of effectiveness.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Policy and Management
Policy Guidance
5.01    At the national level, overall policy guidance for a sound growth of
the TCCA system would be provided by BRDB's 22 member Governing Council
chaired by the Minister of Rural Development and Cooperatives (para 2.17).
This body which has high level representation from the relevant GOB Minis-
tries and agencies would include five members elected by the National
Federation of TCCAs. BRDB-s Director General (DG) (para 2.19) would provide
secretariat support to the Governing Council bringing to its attention
policy issues and recommendations to resolve them. The DG would also be
responsible for the execution of its decisions which directly concern BRDB,
and for monitoring the execution of decisions concerning other GOB agencies.
Project Management
5.02    The Director General would be responsible for the execution of the
project. His responsibilities for the project inter alia would be to:
(a) request, receive and disburse funds under the ADP;
(b) coordinate activities of BRDB with other GOB agencies through the
liaison officers designated by them;
(c) develop, maintain up to date and provide to all TCCA a Banking Plan
agreed with BB and Sonali Bank for effective execution of the TCCA's
credit programs;



-42-
(d) execute contracts and agreements with GOB and private agencies
including, as appropriate, NGOs for providing essential training and
other services to TCCA/KSS/BSS;
(e) enter into agreement with PECU to execute project civil works;
(f) prepare a master plan for, and ensure the execution of, effective
training at RDTI, TTU and TCCA;
(g) recommend the issuance of import licenses to private importers of
STW/LLP engines;
(h) monitor the execution of the project and supply of inputs to, and
performance of, TCCAs;
(i)  monitor the progress in the registration and audit of TCCA/KSS/BSS;
(j) maintain consolidated project accounts and have these audited;
(k) prepare position papers for BRDB-s Governing Council on issues
relating to overall GOB policies as these affect the sound growth of
TCCA/KSS/BSS and seek their resolution; and
(1) claim disbursements from IDA for project expenditures made by BRDB.
5.03    In the execution of his task, the DG is currently supported by three
Directors and 40 other officers at Dhaka (para 2.19) according to a staffing
plan appropriate for BRDB-s normal program of activities, as agreed under
the Joint Review. Subsequent to the Review, the field work for which was
done in October 1980, BRDB has been entrusted with the responsibility for
execution of or as a major participants in, at least seven large new donor
assisted projects 1/ (costing about US$500 M) compared to the situation in
1980, when it was implementing only four donor assisted projects costing
US$120 M. In addition, BRDB has been asked by GOB to place much greater
emphasis on developing and launching an effective program for developing
income generating activities for the rural poor and to undertake the
national monitoring for IMP. Experience to date has shown that BRDB's HQ
staffing requires some modest strengthening and that the position of Direc-
tor (Implementation) under whom all these projects, and the normal BRDB
program for support to the TCCA have been placed, is burdened beyond the
capacity of a single individual. The strengthening is currently underway as
1/ Including IDA financed HTW Project (Cr. 1140-BD), DTW II Project (Cr.
1287-BD), Agricultural Credit Project (Cr. 1147-BD); IFAD's SWRDP and
ADB-s NWRDP.



-43-
PPs for these new projects are approved. It is also necessary that func-
tions of Director (Implementation) be carried by two Directors; one dealing
with the routine credit, irrigation, marketing and cooperative programn of
BRDB, and the other dealing with the Rural Poor Program, and revitalization
of staff and member training (Chart No. 25027). The addition of this fourth
Director would be a condition of disbursement by CIDA against expenditure on
the rural poor program.
5.04    Because of the relatively young age of this organization, BRDB3 s own
full time staff have not yet reached the stage to occupy positions of Direc-
tors. Thus all Directors are appointed by GOB from the civil service., In
the past, frequent transfer of Directors has adversely affected the qulality
of BRDB operations. GOB would ensure careful selection of BRDB Directors
after considering their demonstrated ability to direct rural development
activities and continuing availability for a tenure of at least three years.
B. Participating Agencies
5.05    Other agencies involved in the execution of the project and their
functions would be:
(a) The Registrar of Cooperatives: for the (i) registration of new
TCCA, KSS and BSS; (ii) timely conduct of their annual statutcory
audit; (iii) holding of Annual General Meetings at which new manag-
ing committees are elected; (iv) training of his audit staff at CCC;
and (v) inspection of TCCA/KSS/BSS to see that cooperative laws are
enforced.
(b) Public Works Department for construction of the TTDC, TCCA offices
and TTU through its Project Engineering and Construction Unit.
(c) Bangladesh Bank for (i) clearance of the Banking Plans; (ii) estab-
lishing terms and conditions for TCCA lending; (iii) operating the
Special Account for release of foreign exchange for import of
STW/LLP by private importers; and (iv) refinancing loans made by
Sonali Bank under the project.
(d) Sonali Bank for (i) refinancing credit programs of eligible TCCA;
and (ii) establishing detailed banking plans to be used by all
branch managers.
(e) Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation for (i) field level
support in the expansion of the Irrigation Management Program; and
(ii) training of private mechanics.
(f) Directorate of Agricultural Extension to provide extension support
to tarmers and KSS especially for IMP.



-44-
(g)  Private dealers for (i) obtaining import licences and foreign
exchange releases; (ii) importing, retailing and installing STW/LLP
engines and coupling them with pumps accessories; and (iii) provid-
ing after sales maintenance service to users.
(h)  BSCIC, BHB and selected NGOs for providir.g, under contract with
BRDB, training and marketing services for BSS related activitJies.
(i)  RDA, Bogra for organizing training of BRDB staff for the irrigation
management and rural poor programs.
Inter-agency Coordination
5.06    The three key participating agencies (PWD, Sonali Bank and RCS) each
would make special arrangements for the execution of their activities under
the project. In case of PWD, the PECU established under Credit 787-BD,
which is expected to be physically complete by December 1983, would be
responsible for the construction of project facilities under the project.
PECU at Dhaka is headed by an Additional Chief Engineer; and in the field it
works through a well established engineering organization. Assurance has
been obtained that PECU would continue in existence until construction under
the project comes to an end.
5.07    Sonali Bank's involvement in externally supported projects prcividing
credit support to TCCA has also grown rapidly since 1980. Within SonaLli
Bank, ST credit operations of TCCA are managed separately from MT credit
operations by two different Deputy General Managers (DGM). The designation
of a single DGM to deal with all TCCA credit affairs would contribute immen-
sely to a more smoothly functioning TCCA credit system and such designation
would be a condition of disbursement against expenditures on incremental ST
credit and MT credit for canal lining (para 4.10).
5.08    Similarly, the RCS would designate a Joint Registrar to deal
exclusively with the registration and audit and inspection of the TCCA, KSS
and BSS (para 3.18).
5.09    Each agency would designate a senior staff member to coordinate its
activities with BRDB. In Bangladesh Bank it would be the Chief Credit
Officer; in Sonali Bank a DGM; in RCS, the Joint Registrar; in RDA it would
be the Director; at CCC, the Principal; in BADC, the Director (Irrigation);
in BSCIC, the Director (Planning); and in DAE, the Director. It is expected
that the designation of these officials as agency liaison officers for RD-II
would be completed by July 30, 1983.
5.10    Operational problems with other participating agencies, which cannot
be resolved by DG, BRDB through bilateral efforts but which are not
appropriate to be dealt by the BRDB's Governing Council headed by the Minis-
ter, would be dealt by the National Committee for Multi-sectoral Rural



-45-
Development (NCMRD). NCMRD is headed by Secretary, Rural Development with
Secretary, Agriculture as Co-Chairman and includes representatives of
relevant ministries and agencies. Presently, NCMRD has been given a small
secretariat to monitor the Southwest Rural Development Project. This
secretariat has not been functioning satisfactorily. In any event, this
secretariat would not be capable of providing the support needed for R.D-II
for identifying potential problems, seeking solutions and monitoring
implementation. This would be the responsibility of the DG. Should a.
meeting of NCMRD is convened to review any interagency problems affecting
project implementation, the necessary secretariat support would be provided
by BRDB.
C. Project Implementation
5.11    For effective field implementation, administrative and financial
power would be delegated to the district offices of BRDB. The Headquarters
of BRDB would retain responsibility for policy planning, national level
monitoring and supportive functions. At the district level, a District
Project Director, BRDB would have the primary responsibility for project
activities in his district. Additionally, he would be the Member Secretary
of a District Coordinating Committee headed by the Deputy Commissioner,
which would deal specially with inter-agency coordination and problems which
cannot be solved through bi-lateral efforts. The membership of DCC would
include: District Manager (Sonali Bank), Executive Engineer (PWD), District
Extension Officer, Executive Engineer (BADC), District Officer (BSCIC),
District Fisheries Officer with District Project Director (BRDB) as Execu-
tive Secretary (Chart No. 24717). Assurance has been obtained that DCCs
would be established by September 30, 1983.
5.12    Quarterly District Action Plans would spell out for each participat-
ing agency the tasks to be completed over the following quarter and would
follow a pattern successfully developed under RD-I and now being used in the
field activities of SWRDP. The Deputy Commissioner, with the help of Dis-
trict Project Director, BRDB, monitors the execution of these plans which
are prepared at district inter-agency meetings attended by Dhaka level staff
of all participating agencies and RMB.
Implementation Schedule (Chart I)
5.13    The project would be implemented over a four year period starting
July 1983. Supply of STW and LLP is expected to start in 1984; field
implementation of IMP would be slow initially as the teams are trained and
would build up momentum in 1985. Training of private mechanics would con-
tinue throughout the project period.  Surveys for launching the rural poor
program would be prepared towards the end of 1983. Banking Plans would be
finalized before end of September 1983 to ensure that there is adequate time
for the training of Sonali Bank and TCCA staff before the flow of credit
builds up. Training of BRDB staff at RDTI and revitalizaton of TTU level



-46-
training would be given priority attention from the start of the project.
The section in the office of RCS responsible for the audit of TCCA/KSS/BSS
is expected to be able to clear audit backlogs by July 1984. Because exist-
ing designs will be used for all project buildings and land would be readily
available in the TTDC complex, the construction program is expected to be
launched in early 1984. Finally, technical assistance, to be provided over
the entire project period, is expected to be operational within six months
of credit effectiveness. Assurance has been obtained that key project
actions would be implemented in accordance with a schedule agreed with IDA.
5.14    Smooth implementation would require that all BRDB staff and staff of
agencies participating in the various components are familiar with the
system of supply, sanction and delivery of project inputs. Guidelines for
each component would be prepared by BRDB and the participating agency, and
these would be made available to all project staff. For the credit com-
ponent, these would be in the form of a banking plan (para 4.26).
Experience with such guidelines has been generally favorable, because even
though they are sometimes interpreted too rigidly, in their absence parallel
action by two agencies is extremely difficult. Assurance has been obtained
that implementation guidelines would be provided to IDA for review by Sep-
tember 31, 1983 and would be revised regularly as changes are required.
D. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
5.15    BRDB's Director of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation would be
responsible for M&E functions under the project. Programwide monitoring
capability of BRDB would be strengthened once the consultants for setting up
a Management Information System (MIS), financed under SWRDP, have completed
their task. The consultants for the design and implementation of the MIS
are expected to be recruited by July 1983.
5.16    Evaluation activities under the project would involve in addition to
the usual mid-term and ex-post evaluation of the project, special studies as
needed to evaluate the performance of individual components. These studies
would be executed through contracts with local and foreign consultants and
would focus on the following aspects of the project:
(a)  IMP Expansion:  RDA, Bogra would be contracted by BRDB to undertake
sample basis bench mark and periodic surveys of IMP schemes to
independently check the participation levels, incremental command
areas and other benefits. Selected IMP schemes would be earmarked
for repeat surveys each year in order to follow the dynamics of
change in group management, farmer participation and agricultural
practices.
(b)  Rural Poor Program:  Special effort will be made to obtain feedback
of the problems faced in the implementation of the program to ensure
that modifications needed for successful implementation are being



-47-
made continuously. Other studies will deal with the participation
of target groups in project activities, incremental benefits
obtained, usefulness of training programs and role of women in the
BSS.
(c)  Credit Operations:  Studies would evaluate the credit procedures
in use, the availability of adequate and timely credit to eligible
members and the extent and nature of the bad debt problems; focus
would be on loan recovery performance, defaults by Directors,
presence of defaulters on managing committees and access of small
farmers and sharecroppers to the TCCA credit programs.
(d) Financial Viability and Performance of TCCA/KSS and BSS: Special
studies will be made of selected TCCA of all age groups to see how
far they are able to achieve financial viability. Financial perfor-
mance of new diversified activities undertaken by TCCA would be
specially studied.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.17    TCCA/KSS/BSS are required to maintain accounts according to a system
prescribed by BRDB. The system of accounting is a double entry commercial
system and is basically sound, though implementation has not always been
fully satisfactory. Under the project, a revised set of accounting manuals
for TCCA/KSS/BSS would be employed and accounts staff of TCCA and KSS
retrained.
5.18    The RCS is required to audit annually the accounts of TCCA, KSS and
BSS. TCCA and KSS audits are due to be completed within six months of the
close of the fiscal year. For undertaking the audit of KSS and BSS, t'he
strength and capability of the audit staff would be improved under the
project and for the audit of the TCCA, the RCS would recruit qualified firms
of auditors satisfactory to IDA to clear up the backlog and ensure timeli-
ness and quality of TCCA audits (para 3.18). A draft revised manual for
auditing the accounts of TCCA/KSS/BSS has been prepared. Assurance has been
obtained that, as of December 1983, audits of TCCA/KSS would be carried out
in accordance with the provisions of a revised manual satisfactory to IDA.
5.19    BRDB as an autonomous Board would be subject to statutory budgetary
and financial control. BRDB would receive funds from GOB for: (a) its
headquarters and field establishment costs; (b) grants to be paid to
eligible TCCA; and (c) expenditures on approved projects in the Annual
Development Plan (ADP). The ordinance establishing BRDB requires that funds
received for the purposes listed above are kept and accounted for separately
and that BRDB accounts are audited by an independent auditor, in additLon to
the statutory audit of the Accountant General. BRDB has an audit division
which is responsible for the internal audit of all BRDB funds. Bangladesh



-48-
Bank would maintain separate receipt and expenditure accounts for the Spe-
cial Account as well as for its refinancing of SB's lending to TCCA.
Similar receipt and expenditure accounts as well as accounts of loan
recovery profiles, annual recovery performance and ageing of overdues for
each TCCA would be maintained by SB for its lending activities. Assurance
has been obtained that BRDB, Bangladesh Bank, Sonali Bank and the Registrar
of Cooperative Societies would maintain these separate project accounts and
that project accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA
would be made available to IDA within nine months of the close of each
fi'scal year.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES
Cropping Patterns
6.01    The project would provide tubewell irrigation to presently unir-
rigated areas and through IMP result in an increase in the command area of
already f'ielded minor irrigation equipment. In view of this, the change
in cropping patterns assumed to result from project investments is a reflec-
tion of aL change from unirrigated to irrigated agriculture.
6.02    Since the project is national in scope, an average cropping pattern
has been prepared to reflect the present situation, as well as the chanlges
expected as a result of the project. Basic cropping systems in Bangladesh
are determined primarily by the water regime. Broadly, an unirrigated,
rainfed cropping pattern is typified by a local aman crop produced in the
monsoon season, followed by crops, such as oilseed and/or a legume crop
using residual moisture in the dry season. Cropping intensities of
130-140% are usual under this type of regime. It is assumed that the provi-
sion of irrigation would lead to the introduction of a HYV T. Aman crop
(supplemented by irrigation if necessary), and the replacing of low-yielding
oilseeds/pulses by irrigated Boro and/or HYV wheat, or other high-value cash
crops. For the purposes of analysis, the dry season crops are represented
by irrigated Boro and HYV wheat. While in some cases, cropping intensities
of over 200% can be expected with the introduction of irrigation, an average
cropping intensity of 180% has been assumed for farmers benefitting from
irrigation investment financed under the project.
Yields and Production
6.03    Yield estimates, both with and without project, reflect average
situations for unirrigated and irrigated agriculture. The availability of
an assured water supply, under direct control of KSS/farmers, would
encourage farmers to take greater risks; this combined with strengthening of
the TCCA/KSS system as a credit disbursing and input supply channel, is,
estimated to lead to the increased and more effective use, by farmers, of
high yielding varieties, fertilizers and pesticides, and thus to higher



-49-
yields.  Yield assumptions under different cropping patterns are summarized
below:
Cropping Pattern (ac)   Yields (mds/ac)
P        W             P       W
Aman (Local)                   1.0       -             20      -
T. Aman (HYV)                  -        1.0             -     35 /a
Boro                                    0.5             -     32 7a
Wheat (HYV)                    -        0.3             -     25 7
Oilseeds                      0.2        -              6      -
Pulses                        0.2        -              6
Total Cropped Area            1.4       1.8
Net Cultivated Area           1.0       1.0
Cropping Intensity            140%      180%
/a  Areas brought under IMP would obtain 5% higher yields.
6.04    Total incremental production due to the project is based on the
conversion of 510,000 ac of recently unirrigated land to irrigated agricul-
ture through the sale of 30,000 STW and 3,000 one-cusec LLP. In addition,
for the 4,400 DTW and 1,100 two-cusec LLP to be brought under IMP, it is
assumed that the command area of a DTW would increase by 20 ac and of a
two-cusec LLP by 10 ac, thus adding 99,000 ac to the already existing com-
mand area. The total incremental production expected as a result of the
project at full development in year 4 is expected to be 744,000 tons of
paddy and 174,000 tons of wheat.
Marketing
6.05    Marketing of the incremental production of foodgrains, arising as a
result of the project, is not expected to pose a problem. Given the chronic
situation of inadequate food production in Bangladesh, it is likely that
much of the incremental grain production would be absorbed locally within
the areas in which it is produced. Surplus would be handled by the tradi-
tional marketing system which is well developed and producers would also be
able to use the GOB foodgrain procurement system.
Prices (Annex 6, Table 1)
6.06    With a rapidly increasing population, leading to an increased demand
for food, crop prices in Bangladesh are largely determined by the supply
situation. The latter, in turn, is determined to a large extent by weather,
and prices vary significantly between locations, seasons and from one year
to another. In an attempt to stabilize prices, GOB provides guaranteed
support prices, and intervenes in foodgrain marketing through its procure-
ment system. However, its impact on effective price stabilization has so



-50-
far been limited and farmers in most cases do not receive the guaranteed
price. In view of this the actual three year average (FY80-FY82) farmgate
prices have been used for financial projections in this report. For the
main outputs, financial prices used are Tk 119/md for Aman paddy, Tk 116/md
for Boro paddy and Tk 121/md for wheat. Input prices used, including those
for labor (Tk 15 per man day) and draft power (Tk 22 per ox-pair day), are
based on prevailing market prices.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND COST RECOVERY
A. Farm Incomes
7.01    The impact of the project on farm incomes has been analyzed boith on
an irrigation group basis, as well as on the basis of a one acre farm. The
latter is as typical as any for the small holders, who are expected to be
the main beneficiaries of the project.
7.02    The ultimate command area of a STW is expected to be 15 acres, and
that of 1 cusec LLP 20 acres, and it is assumed that it would take three
years for these areas to come under irrigation. Based on these assumpl:ions,
and those described in the preceeding chapter incremental net incomes, as
well as financial rates of return have been calculated for STW and LLP
irrigation groups. Details of the analysis are shown in Annex 5, Tables 4
and 5 with the salient features summarized below:
STW                    LLP
Present  Year 5 /a      Present  Year 5/a
.................. (Tk) ....-.....
Net Farm Income per

Average Farmer /b                  2,100      3,206         2,100      3,527

Internal Rate of Return                   38%                        56%
NPV (at 12% discount rate)                77,545                  138,351
/a  At full development.
7T  Incomes shown are after debt servicing.
7.03    Net farm incomes of average one acre farmers are calculated to
increase by 53% or Tk 3,206 in the case of STW groups and by 68% or to
Tk 3,527 in the case of LLP groups. Based on a norm for subsistence of 15.5
ounces of grain per capita per day, and an average family size of six (four
adult equivalent), farm families would move from a position where production



-51-
from a one-acre farm is presently unable to meet this norm and thus whose
incomes have to be supplemented by other activities; into one where there
would be a small surplus from the families direct farming operations.
Importantly the cash flow projections show that members of STW and LLP
irrigation groups would have no difficulties in servicing their loans.
B. Income from Activities under the Rural Poor Components
7.04    Based on experience from ongoing programs in Bangladesh for which
financial and other data are available, an analysis has been undertaken to
assess the probable returns from, and the financial viability of the
activities to be supported under the project. The results of this analysis
are detailed in Annex 5, Table 6 and summarized below:
Investment       Present         Net       Incremental
Medium     Working   Net Cash   Cash Inflow   Net Cash
Activity            Term Loan  Capital    Inflow    with Project   Inflow
....... .... (Tk) .                           ..
Pond Fisheries       21,115      2,047      1,500           2,080            580
Beef Fattening        1,300       -         1,500           2,914         1,414
Livestock for Milk   3,200        -         1,500           3,847         2,347
Handloom              4,000    15,300       2,400           5,722         3,322
Oil Milling           3,000      7,500      1,500          10,887         9,387
Rickshaw Pulling      3,800       -         3,900           7,085         3,185
Cane and Bamboo        -         2,400      1,500           5,150         3,650
Carpentry             3,000      8,667      3,000          14,484        11,484
Pottery               3,500      1,283      1,500           5,925         4,425
7.05    In estimating present earnings, it is assumed that rickshaw pullers
are hiring rickshaw at a fee, while weavers are working as hired labor in
large handloom units.  In all other cases it is assumed that present earn-
ings are derived from working as laborers.  Based on interviews in the
field, as well as the results of various studies, it is estimated that a
laborer finds work for an average of four months in a year at wages between
Tk 10-15 per day. Cost and benefit profiles for each activity have been
derived from interviews in the field, as well as from information obtained
from ongoing activities of various NGOs and GOB agencies.
7.06    Cash profiles for all activities show that beneficiaries  total net
cash inflow with the project would increase significantly. In all cases,
except pond fisheries and beef fattening, total net earnings would be able
to meet the minimum subsistence requirements of a typical rural family.
Financial rates of return to all resources (except the family labor), used
in the enterprises would be quite high - ranging from 31% in the case of
handlooms to over 160% in the case of cane and bamboo work. Cash flow
projections indicate that for all proposed activities borrowers would be
able to service their loans.



-52-
C. Financial Performance of a Participating TCCA
7.07    Income and expenditure projections have been prepared for both a
TCCA typical of the 210 existing TCCA and one typical of the 90 new TCCA
expected to be developed under the project. These projections, based on
present and projected flow of both short term and medium credit as minor
irrigation development spreads to KSS, are in Annex 5, Tables 8 to 13. They
are based on the following key assumptions:
(a)  for an existing TCCA, the percentage of -A  and  B  KSS borrowing ST
credit would remain constant at 60%; the current national average is
60% and in the seven TCCA of RD-I, it is 98%;
(b)  based on the total number of different types of irrigation equipment
projected to become available over the future, and the past perfor-
mance of TCCA, it is estimated that over the next five years
approximately 90,000 STW equivalent 1/ units would be sold nation-
wide through the TCCA/KSS system; an average of 52 STW equivalent
units by year 5 compared to the current figure per TCCA of 56;
(c)  the average ST borrowing per 'A  and -B  KSS is expected to go up in
the case of a new TCCA, from Tk 12,000 in year 1 to Tk 42,400 in
year 8, while for an existing TCCA it would go up from Tk 24,400 to
Tk 42,400 in year 5.  The volume of ST credit per 'A  and  B  KSS in
FY82 was Tk 10,500 and rose to Tk 20,000 when crop limits were
raised recently;
(d)  the recovery profile for ST credit based on past performance, would
show a 98% recovery of principal and interest over a six year
period. This is below the 99% recovery achieved by June 30, 1982
for loans more than six years old. For MT credit, for which
experience is not yet adequate, a recovery profile similar to that
for ST credit is assumed. For both ST and MT credit, a bad debt
expense equivalent to 2% of the amount disbursed is charged in the
year of loan disbursement;
(e)  shares and savings deposited by KSS with a TCCA would be deposited
with Sonali Bank and would earn interest. Fivesixth of interest
earned on the deposit of savings would be given to KSS. On ST
credit outstanding the TCCA would earn a margin of 7% per annum and
on MT credit, 4%;
1/ Various minor irrigation units are converted into STW equivalents in
terms of MT credit associated with the sale of various types of equip-
ment.



-53-
(f) TCCA would meet the salaries/allowances of all its staff including
those provided by BRDB and its operating expenses. However, expen-
ditures on member training have not been included since it is
believed that this is a legitimate expense of BRDB.
7.08    Based on the above assumptions, the income projections show that a
new TCCA should be able to cover all its expenditures, including the
salaries of key staff seconded by BRDB, by year 6 when the annual lending
volume is expected to reach Tk 2.1 M. An average existing TCCA should be
able to achieve a similar status in year 2 when the annual lending volume
is expected to reach Tk 2.7 M. For a new TCCA, about 90% of the income
would be from margins earned on ST and MT credit operations, while for an
existing TCCA it would be 85%. The remaining 10% and 15% respectively would
be from interest earned on deposits. In case of a new TCCA, salaries of
staff and office operating expenses would constitute 90% of the total expen-
ditures in year 1 and decrease to 70% in year 10; for an existing TCCA these
costs would decrease from 75% in year 1 to 55% in year 10.
7.09    Sensitivity Analysis:  The above outcome is dependent on two key
variables: (i) the growth is ST credit over the years; and (ii) the number
of minor irrigation units financed by the TCCA. To test the possibility of
a slower build up in sales of minor irrigation equipment and thus MT and ST
credit, a sensitivity analysis has been done. For existing TCCA, the volume
of ST credit for  A  and  B  class KSS is assumed to remain static at
Tk 24,400 and the number of STW equivalent units sold per TCCA is reduced by
half.  For a new TCCA, ST credit for 'A  and  B' class KSS is assumed to
increase from Tk 12,000 in year 1 to Tk 24,400 in year 4 and thereafter to
remain static and the number of STW equivalent units sold per TCCA is a:Lso
reduced by half.
7.10    Such slower growth in minor irrigation sales and thus in MT and ST
credit would delay the equalization of expenditures by income to year 8 for
a new TCCA. For an existing TCCA, the income would still exceed expend:Lture
in year 2, but would be by a 55% reduced margin. Deficits in income over
expenditure are covered by BRDB in the form of grants to cover salaries and
expenditures of key staff.
TCCA Grants
7.11    BRDB provides TCCA with an annual grant to cover the cost of train-
ing and also pays the salaries and travelling allowances for the key staff
seconded to TCCA. Training grants would continue to be given but be re:Lated
to the actual training conducted by a TCCA rather than be in the form of
fixed amount of grant in aid. Annual accounts for training expenditures
would be provided by each TCCA, and audited by BRDB-s internal audit diviL-
sion.



-54-
7.12    Grants for expenditures on the salaries of key staff of the TCCA
would be required by a new TCCA at least for the first six years after its
establishment. BRDB would constantly review the need for continued grants
for a TCCA and would link the extent of the cost of the salaries of key TCCA
staff that it bears, to the growth in a TCCA's credit volume. A suitable
formulation would be:
Annual Volume of Credit (Tk M)        % of BRDB Grant for Key Staff
Less than 2.0                             100
2.5                             75
3.0                             50
3.5                             25
4.0                            Nil
Assurance has been obtained that BRDB would by June 30, 1984 and annual:Ly
thereafter, provide IDA with an analysis of the financial performance oiE all
TCCA which have been operating for at least six years as of December 31 of
the previous year; and cause the TCCA which are achieving an adequate level
of credit operations to bear a proportion of the costs of key BRDB staff
according to a schedule agreed with IDA. Technical assistance would be
available to BRDB to undertake this analysis which would involve a study of
the loan recovery situation, classification of overdues and assessment of
income accrued and realisable over a three year period.
7.13    To provide an incentive to TCCA staff to work towards profitability,
the cooperative rules provide that up to 2% of TCCA profits may be used to
give bonuses to staff. GOB has already decided to introduce this provision
in those TCCAs which reduce to below 50% their dependence on BRDB for grants
to cover salaries of key staff.
Produce and Fertilizer Marketing
7.14    Some TCCAs are already carrying out marketing of paddy and milled
rice on a profitable basis. Based on their experience, an analysis of the
financial viability of paddy marketing operation has been done (Annex 5,
Table 9). The profitability of such a venture is sensitive to the price
received from the sale of rice, as well as the price paid for paddy. It is
projected that such a venture would yield a significant net cash inflow,
after debt servicing, in the case of better quality rice, but would suffer a
loss while handling coarse rice. As at present, TCCA marketing operations
are unlikely to cover coarse paddy.
7.15    Annual costs which a TCCA would have to incur in running a 200 ton
fertilizer marketing godown are:

Tk
Staff Wage Costs /a                          16,000
Maintenance and Overhead Costs                7,500

/a Storekeeper, Assistant and Night Watchman.
/b Based on a loan of Tk 250,000 at 14% interest
p.a., and a repayment period of ten years.
Within the present pricing system, TCCA receive a commission from BADC of
Tk 105/ton for wholesaling fertilizer. Based on this, a TCCA would have to
sell at least 680 tons of fertilizer per annum in order to earn enough
commission to break even. Past experience, including that of the FAO
assisted fertilizer marketing project, shows that this would be feasible for
many TCCAs.
D. Cost Recovery
7.16    While STW are sold at full cost, DTW and LLP still carry a subsidy
of 75% and 20% respectively. GOB is committed to phase out these subsidies
and thus all STW and LLP (US$57.9 M) would be sold on a full cost basis.
For other credit components of the project (US$83.8 M), interest rates would
be at 17.5% for ST and rural poor credit and 14% for others. These are the
highest rates prevailing in the agricultural sector in Bangladesh and in
relation to expected inflation, these rates would be real. None of the
inputs supplied under the rural poor program are expected to be subsidized.
7.17    GOB would bear the full cost of physical facilities provided foi,
training, i.e., TTU and RDTI buildings, TTDC buildings, and project staff
quarters (US$11.9 M). Part of the costs for TCCA facilities (US$3.4 M)
would be recovered through a rent paid by the TCCA for their facilities.
Costs of key staff provided to TCCA by BRDB, currently met by grants from
GOB, would be phased out over a six year period.  Cost of project vehicLes
(US$1.65 M) would be borne by GOB, but motorcycles and bicycles (US$1.8 M)
for GOB field officers and TCCA staff would be supplied to such officers on
a hire-purchase basis. Finally, all training costs and operating costs of
GOB staff and agencies (US$14.6 M) would continue to be borne by GOB as
would the cost of technical assistance (US$2.45 M).

VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01    The principal benefits from project investments would be increased
agricultural production and employment and income generation for the rural
poor including women. They would be achieved basically through the
strengthening of the TCCA cooperative system as a channel for rural credit,
inputs and sale of irrigation equipment; the strengthening of IMP, and by
activities designed to directly benefit the rural poor. These later
activities would be on a comparatively limited scale but would have a sub-
stantial demonstration effect that should lead to their subsequent expansion
outside the six districts covered under the project. The project would
improve the financial viability of the TCCA and enable them to operate as
self managed farmer institutions. These stronger institutions are expected
to improve the quality of interaction between farmers and GOB development
agencies as well as the implementation of agricultural and rural development
programs. Importantly, the project would reduce Bangladesh's dependence on
imported foodgrains.
8.02    Below, the more specific benefits arising from the project are
discussed. However, a project of this nature, with its emphasis on institu-
tion building, has significant secondary benefits which cannot be quan-
tified. These would arise out of linkage and multiplier effect caused by
the promotion of a stronger cash economy in rural areas.
8.03    Employment Impact:  Increased agricultural activity under the
project, as well as the rural poor component, would lead to increased
employment in rural areas. The increase in annual on-farm work is estimated
as 45 M person days at full development. This would be due to the increased
employment of farm-family members andl hired labor as a consequence of
irrigation in the dry season. The rural poor component is expected to
create an additional 5 M person days of annual employment at full develop-
ment. Finally, temporary employment would be created as a result of con-
struction works implemented under the project. This is estimated at about
6 M person days over the four year project period.
8.04    Income Distribution Impact:  Based on the past profile of TCCA/lKSS
borrowers by size of landholdings, and the projected profile with more
active participation of smaller farmers in a strengthened TCCA/KSS system
under the project, the likely distribution by landholding of beneficiaries
under the project is shown below:

/a  Source:  Joint Review of IRDP.
/b  Excluding beneficiaries of ST credit program.
Based on the farm models prepared for STW and LLP groups (para 7.03) the
average net farm income per acre would go up from Tk 2,100 to Tk 3,300. For
a family of six, holding 1 ac of land, the latter would amount to Tk 550 per
capita annually, and for a similar family owing 3 ac of land to Tk 1,650.
This compares with a national per capita income estimated at about Tk 2,650.
In addition to the above, an estimated 59,000 families are expected to
benefit from the rural poor program including 2,300 under the private
mechanics program. These beneficiaries have present earnings averaging
around Tk 1,500 annually which is much below the national average. Thus, a
large majority of direct beneficiaries under the project are expected to be
people who are presently among the lowest income group in the rural economy.
8.05    Balance of Payment Impact:  Increased grain production would result
in reduced grain imports. The gross value of annual incremental grain
production at full development is estimated at US$195 M. Direct foreign
exchange expenditure (fertilizer, pesticides, diesel), excluding debt ser-
vicing and other secondary foreign exchange expenditure, is estimated at
US$35 M annually, at full development.
8.06    Economic Analysis:  The economic analysis of the project as a whole
employs the following assumptions:
(a)  Exchange Rate and Standard Conversion Factor:  The official value of
the Bangladesh Taka has recently been linked to the US dollar and in
recent months this rate has fluctuated between Tk 22.0 and Tk 24.0
per US$1. An exchange rate of Tk 23 per US Dollar has been used in
this analysis. All goods and services have been valued at their
border prices. For traded commodities, border prices at farmgate
level have been derived from prevailing and projected world market
prices. Non-traded commodities, the prices of which include various
locally created distortions, have been valued a border prices by
applying a standard conversion factor of 0.83 to their local prices.



-58-
(b) Value of Unskilled Labor: The economic value of labor is estimated
at its opportunity cost, in terms of production foregone in alterna-
tive activities, valued at border prices. Given the prevailing
conditions of under and unemployment in Bangladesh, the opportunity
cost of unskilled labor (both on-farm and off-farm) is estimated at
68% 1/ of the prevailing average market wage rate of Tk 15 per day,
i.e., Tk 10.20 per day. Valued at border prices (by applying SICF),
the economic price of unskilled labor is estimated at Tk 8.50 per
man day.
(c) Investment and Operating Costs: All investment costs (excluding
price contingencies), valued at border prices, have been included in
computing the project ERR; duties, taxes and subsidies have been
excluded. A specific construction conversion factor of 0.77 was
used to convert financial costs of building construction into
economic values. This is based on the assumption that the unit cost
of building construction includes a 33% foreign exchange componient,
32% local non-traded materials and skilled services, 30% unskilled
labor, and 5% taxes. Provision has been made for the replacement
cost of engines and pumps for irrigation equipment, as well as the
replacement of vehicles and other equipment, over the period of
analysis. Finally, all incremental operating costs (training,
staff, vehicles operation, building maintenance), related to the
institutional support component (BRDB, TCCA, KSS, RCS), have been
included. It is assumed that the cooperative training costs, as
well as those related to IMP, Rural Poor Program, and audit wou:Ld
continue beyond the project period, for the full benefits of the
project to be achieved.
(d) Production Costs: All incremental on-farm production costs have
been included (based on per acre requirements shown on Annex 5,
Table 2), as well as the operating and maintenance costs for irriga-
tion equipment (Annex 5, Table 3). On-farm benefits and costs are
deferred by one year, and an incremental working capital stream is
introduced. Assuming two cropping seasons, working capital is
estimated to amount to 50% of incremental operating costs of the
following year. Total working capital is recovered at the end of
the project period. These adjustments are made to allow for the
time lags occuring between incremental costs and benefits. Total
production costs for the rural poor program have been derived from
cost profiles for each activity. Incremental labor provided by the
1/ The opportunity cost of labor is likely to differ between different
areas, depending on the prevailing levels of economic activity in the
respective areas. However, as the project is national in scope, an
average has been used for the purpose of the analysis.



-59-
head of the household has been valued on the same basis as for other
components. Labor provided by other family members (wife and
children) has been valued at 10% of the computed economic value of
labor to reflect the value of additional consumption required to
undertake these activities.
te)  Benefits:  Direct incremental benefits from the irrigation equipment
financed by the project, and from the area brought under IMP, have
been included in the economic analysis. These are derived from an
increase in cropping intensity, due to dry season cultivation made
possible by irrigation, increased yields caused by the use of high
yielding varieties, fertilizers and pesticides, and a marginal
increase in yields on presently irrigated areas which would be
brought under IMP with the project.  Similarly, only direct benefits
from the rural poor program have been included. These include the
incremental quantities of fish, beef, milk, oil extracted from oil
seed, oil cakes, wood, clay and bamboo products, and coarse cloth
which would be produced under the project. 1/ No weights have been
assigned to reflect the favorable income distribution impact of the
project.
(f) Phasing: Based on the phasing of area per unit of irrigation equip-
ment (Annex 5, Table 1), the full development STW/LLP irrigated area
of 510,000 ac, and the 99,000 additional area irrigated under IMP
would be reached in year 6. A gradual increase in yields per acre
with the project, has been assumed, leading to full development, in
terms of incremental production, in year 9.
8.07    ERR and Sensitivity Analysis:  Based on the above assumption, the
economic prices of the main inputs and outputs as shown in Annex 6, Table 1,
and a period of analysis of 21 years, the ERR for the project as a whole is
estimated to be 79% (Net Present Value, at a 12% discount rate, of Tk 12,505
M).  The ERR of the rural poor program is estimated at 37% (NPV of Tk 55 M,
at a 12% discount rate). Since returns from IMP are expected to be high in
relation to costs, a rate of return has been calculated for the total
project, excluding the benefits from IMP. This is estimated to be 72%.
1/ With the exception of oil extracted from oil seeds, all other outputs
from the rural poor program are treated as non-tradeables, as these
would not have a balance of payments impact.



-60-
8.08    Switching values 1/ were calculated at a discount rate of 12%, to
test the sensitivity of the above result to changes in values of key vari-
ables. With the exception of paddy yields and prices, the analysis reveals
that the project is not sensitive to changes in the values of the other
variables. As shown in the table below, yields would have to be 31% lower
than those assumed in this analysis for the total project ERR to fall to
12%.
Switching
Variable               Unit              Value %
Paddy Yield            Mds/ac               -36
Paddy Price            Tk/md                -55
Other sensitivity tests show the ERR would decline to 41%, if irrigation
development and consequently on-farm net incremental benefits, were delayed
by two years while physical and training investments were carried out on
schedule. The very favorable rate of return is essentially the result of
the highly productive and well proven technical package proposed to farmers
under this project; namely irigation water and modern inputs. Moreover,
this combination has the additional advantage of having a short gestation
period, yielding benefits within one year of the investment. Finally, the
RD-II project being primarily a follow-up project, major physical and
institution-buildng investments took place during past years.
8.09    Project Risks:  While the project faces no major overall economic
risk, particularly in view of the estimated high rate of return, elements
of risk are associated with the possibility of delayed irrigation develop-
ment as in case of RD-I, with the possibility of slower development of TCCA
as effective institutions, and with the expansion of BRDB's rural poor
program. The success of the project will depend on an effective procurement
system for the minor irrigation equipment, which under the project has been
put in the hands of the private sector. Private dealers who so far have had
only one year to develop a mechanism to deal with the TCCA for the timely
supply, installation and payments for STW/LLPs, have faced some initial
implementation difficulties. The project incorporates a number of measures
to expedite licensing procedures as well as to improve the system for
processing of credit and payment to dealers by TCCA. Equally important
would be GOB efforts to constantly monitor and remove the administrative
obstacles in the way of the develoment of an effective private sector import
and retail system for minor irrigation equipment.
1/ A Switching Value for a variable is defined as that value which, at the
given discount rate, would make the net present value of the project
equal to zero.



-61-
8.10    The institution building effort of the project critically deperLds
on the effectiveness of BRDB. In recent years, BRDB's performance has
deteriorated mainly due to the uncertainty in which it was left by GOB with
regard to its future role and status, a situation which seriously affected
staff morale. However, recent Government measures to finally provide, after
10 years of uncertainty, an independent Board status for BRDB and to
decentralize BRDB's management, are indications that GOB seriously intends
to revitalize BRDB. The project emphasis on strengthening BRDB's total,
program rather than focussing on the integrated development of a limited
geographical area is also aimed to make BRDB a more effective institution.
8.11    The success of the project will depend also on the establishment
of an effective credit distribution system.  Credit distribution to TCCA/KSS
and their credit recovery performance have deteriorated in recent years--as
it has for the rest of the agricultural sector--due to a number of reasons
for which BRDB/TCCA are only partly responsible. While the joint GOB/IDA
Agricultural Credit Review will address all aspects of the overall agricul-
tural credit system and the project Incorporates major changes required in
the TCCA/KSS system to remedy the present situation, it must be recognized
that agricultural credit is closely entertwined with social and political
factors prevailing in the countryside, which may be difficult to overccme.
Loan recovery performance poorer than that achieved in the past would not
affect the economic impact as significantly as it would the institution.
building and cost recovery objectives of the project.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT II PROJECT
Lending Procedures for TCCA Credit Operations
A. Medium Term Credit
1.      Steps involved in processing a MT credit application would be as
follows:
(a) an irrigation sub-group under a KSS would make an application for
the purchase of a STW or for construction of lined channels.
Application would be on TCCA's standard form showing each member s
land holding, and would be supported by legal papers for joint and
several responsibility for loan repayment. A minimum potential
irrigated area of 12 acres would be required for an application to
be considered;
(b) using thana irrigation maps available in many thanas, and after
conducting a field inspection, the TPO would recommend the appLica-
tion of eligible KSS to the TCCA managing committee;
(c) a consolidated list of applications approved by the managing commit-
tee, would be sent to the Sonali Bank branch manager for forma:L
sanction of the loans; this list would be accompanied by all
relevant data requested by the Sonali Bank, but all supporting
papers would be retained by the TCCA;
(d) TCCA would make an application for the insurance of the minor
irrigation equipment with the Shadharan Bima Corporation and forward
the insurance policy to the Sonali Bank branch manager;
(e)  upon installation of the minor irrigation equipment, the purchasing
KSS would approve the supplier's bill requesting payment, TCCA would
make the payment to the supplier by check using a line of credit
established by Sonali Bank, and would charge a loan to the KSS; and
(f)  Sonali Bank would charge a loan to the TCCA when the check issued to
the supplier is presented for payment.
2.      Eligibility criteria for TCCA/KSS and members would be revised as
follows:
(a) for a TCCA to be eligible for finance from Sonali Bank for MT credit
given to eligible KSS, it would have to (i) achieve a minimum
recovery during the previous 12 months of 65% of the total demand



-75-
ScheduLe C
Page 2
for all MT credit; (ii) allocate at least 2% of the interest margin
it had received on previous loans to bad debt reserve; and (iii)
submit a statement showing overdues by age;
(b)  for a KSS to be eligible for financing from TCCA for MT credit, it
would have to (i) achieve a minimum recovery during the previout, 12
months of 100% of the total demand for all MT credit; and
(c)  for a member of a KSS to obtain finance for MT, he would have to
repay 100% of all amounts due.
3.      Guidelines for branch managers and regional managers would be estab-
lished by Sonali Bank to help them determine without reference to HQ the
annual credit limits for eligible TCCA for MT credit.  These limits would be
related to the classification of TCCA (Schedule B) and would be higher for
'A  class TCCA than for  B  class TCCA.  Sonali Bank would also introduce
monthly and quarterly reports from branch managers to report exclusively on
the activities of the SB branch relating to its MT credit operations with
the TCCA.
B. Short Term Credit
4.      Steps involved in obtaining ST credit would be as follows:
(a)  a KSS manager would prepare a KSS production plan -- a document
which records the land holding, cropping plan, input and credit
needs of the members of a KSS; these plans in the past have been
prepared on a seasonal basis but, under the project, this would
shift to an annual basis; the production plan when submitted to the
TCCA with a supportive resolution of the KSS managing committee
would constitute a loan application;
(b)  TPO would consolidate the loan applications of all eligible KSS; as
the number of KSS has grown the preparation of one consolidated
application for all KSS has led to delays in loan approvals; thus,
under the project, consolidated applications would be prepared for
about 20 KSS;
(c)  TCCA management committee would approve the loan application and
forward the consolidated applications with all essential supporting
information to the Sonali Bank branch for sanction. All supporting
papers would be retained at the TCCA to be available for inspection
by authorized staff of the Sonali Bank; the past practice of
applications being forwarded by TCCA to District Project Directors
and BRDB HQ would be discontinued; and
(d)  by writing checks to suppliers and KSS, TCCA would draw against the
sanctioned credit limit approved by Sonali Bank.
5.      Eligibility criteria for TCCA/KSS members would be revised as follows:



-76-                            Schedule C
Page 3
(a) for a TCCA to be eligible for finance from Sonali Bank for ST
credit, it would have to (i) achieve a minimum recovery during the
previous 12 months of 65% of the total demand for all ST credit;
(ii) allocate at least 2% of the interest margin it had received on
previous loans to bad debt reserve; and (iii) submit a statement
showing overdues by age;
(b) for a KSS to be eligible for financing by TCCA for ST credit, it
would have to (i) achieve a minimum recovery during the previous 12
months of 100% of the total demand for all ST credit;
(c) for a member of a KSS to be eligible for ST credit, he would have to
repay 100% of all amounts due; a member would be eligible to borrow
for a following crop even when previous loans are outstanding but
not overdue.
6.      Guidelines for Sonali Bank branch and regional managers would be
established to enable them to determine the credit limits for a eligible
TGCA without reference to SB Headquarters. Calculation of the annual credit
limit of the TCCA would be linked to its classification (Schedule B).
C. Rural Poor Credit
7.      Under the project, a credit program would be established by Sonali
Bank through the TCCA for lending to eligible BSS. Steps involved in
obtaining such a loan would be as follows:
(a) a BSS manager would prepare a BSS activity plan grouping members
according to specific activities for which they have been trained or
already have the skills; the activity plan would record the input
and credit needs of the members, and when forwarded to the TCCA with
a supportive resolution of the managing committee, would constitute
a loan application;
(b) TPO would arrange for the activity plans to be reviewed by
appropriate GOB technical agencies and recommend the application of
eligible BSS to the management committee for approval;
(c)  TCCA will forward the consolidated plan, with supporting information
and the report of the technical review, to the branch of Sonali Bank
for sanction of loan; and
(d)  once the total TCCA loan is sanctioned by Sonali Bank, payment to
suppliers or BSS would be made by TCCA upon presentation of a bill
approved by the beneficiaries; TCCA would charge a loan to the BSS
at the time of payment to supplier; and
(e)  Sonali Bank would charge a loan to the TCCA at the time the check
issued by the TCCA is presented for encashment.



-7 7-
Schedule C
Page 4 -
8.      Eligibility of the TCCA/BSS members for loans would be established
as follows:
(a) a TCCA to be eligible for finance from Sonali Bank for loans under
the rural poor program would have to be 'A' or 'B' class, and would
have to (i) achieve a minimum recovery during the previous 12 months
of 65% of total demand of loans given to BSS; (ii) allocate 2% out
of interest margin it had received on previous loans to bad debt
reserve; and (iii) submit a statement showing overdues by age;
(b) for a BSS to be eligible for finance from TCCA, it would have to
achieve a minimum loan recovery during the previous 12 months of 75%
of the total demand for all loans to members;
(c) for a member to be eligible for loans from a BSS, he or she would
have to repay 90% of all amounts due; the normal KSS requirement of
depositing 10% of the loan amount as shares/deposits would be
relaxed to 5% in case of BSS members.
9.      Guidelines for Sonali Bank and TCCA would be established to enable
them to determine loan limits without reference to their respective HQ.
These guidelines would allow a branch manager to approve loans, once these
have been appraised by the appropriate GOB agency, without reference to HQ
provided the TCCA and BSS both meet eligibility criteria.
D. Diversified Lending
10.     This lending will be for selected TCCAs to invest in marketing and
fertilizer godowns. Loan applications would be appraised by Sonali Bank.
In case of fertilizer godowns, Sonali Bank's appraisal would focus on the
likely TCCA turnover of fertilizer in its thana of operation (para 7.15); in
case of crop marketing loans for crops other than paddy, careful scrutiny
would be required to assess the seasonal variations, processing and handling
costs and prices obtainable in retail markets. Sonali Bank branch managers
would refer these application their Headquarters, using proforma prescribed
by Sonali Bank.

4/  Due to a all round substitution of 2 cusec LLPs by 1 cusec LLPs, the numbers of equipment being supplied    H
exceed the MTFPP requirement; however the total cusec capacity is still not exceeded; it is estimated               _
that a gap of about 13,000 1 cusec units still exists.

fund by allocating to it 5% of the initial loan, and this fund is used to
maintain program recovery levels against repayment difficulties of individual
borrowers.
/ Since July 1976.
/ Since July 1979.

/  Since January 1975.
8/  Because of differing inception dates for various programs, the recovery % is
not strictly comparable being biased towards older programs. However, data.
on annual recovery against demand is not available.

J/  Loan limits will be increased from Tk 700 to Tk 900 per acre for T. Aman;  Tk 800 to Tk 2,000 for HYV Boro;  Tk 650 to Tk 1,000 for
Aus/LIV Boro; Tk 550 to Tk ',500 for Wheat;  Tk 1,000 to Tk 4,000 for Potato;  and Tk 600 to Tk 1,250 for Tobacco.
j/  Assuming total loan mix will change from 28 Aman;  51% HYV Boro;  16% Local Aus and Boro;  3,5% Wheat;  1.5% Potato and Tobacco .Q
20%, 65%, 5%, 5%, 5% respectively by 1987. The average limit will increase to Tk 1,545 and shift to Tk 1,825 as loan mix changes.
2/  It is expected that each EiS will have equivalent of 4 STWs, about 40,000 KSS can be covered .on this basis by the total minor irrigation
equipment likely to.be available to TCCA (Annex 1, Table 4); of these 25,000 are expected to be under RD-II.
i/ A conservative projection for increase in demand for ST credit an irrigation expands to cover 9(% of 'A' and 'B' claase M5S.
5/  From a FY 82 average of Tk 10,500 per 'A' and 'B' KSS, the average will increase to Tk 24,400 due to higher crcp limitz.
i/  Loan mix is assumed static at 2C0 Aman; 65% Boro; 15% others as in 1982.
I/  Ur.der the project, IM1P will expand starting from a base of 300 in FY 83 to additional 495 KSS in Year 2; 1,485 in Year 3; 2,970 in Year 4;
and 4,950 by FY 88; credit per IMP KSS will increase from EY 81 average of about Tik 33,000 to Tk 80,600 due to higher loan limits.                           X
8/  Loan iimits will be regularly revised to reflect agricultural input price increases, which have been assumed to be in line with
contingiPncy factors shown on Annrc 3,Table 1.
k/ 'oreign exchange cost of the items (cash inputs) financed by LT credit is estimated at 4t.

Note:  Physical Contingencies - In estimating total project cost, no physical contingencies have been provided
on minor irrigation equipment, 10% on civil works, and 5% on all other costs.
Price Contingencies    - These have been calculated on the basis of the following:
i) Base costs are expressed in mid 1983 prices, by applying, to mid 1982
prices, a 13% inflation factor on local oDsts and 8% on foreign costs.
ii)  Anticipated inflation during the project period is assumed as follows!
Foreign Costs : Year 1 to 4 - 7.5% p.a.
Local Costs   : Year 1 - 13%; Year 2 - 11%; Years 3 & 4 - 10% p.a.

RURAL DEVELOPMENT II PROJECT
RURAL POOR PROGRAM
A Profile of Income Generating Activities for the Rural Poor
1.      While BSS members would have the opportunity to decide the activities
they would like to pursue, from the experience of ongoing programs, some
promising activities have been identified which would be initially supported
by the project. These are discussed below. Other suitable activities iden-
tified in the special surveys to be done in each district would be included
during implementation.
Pond Fisheries
2.      Pond or tanks suitable for fish culture are a major national resource
in Bangladesh. There are about 1.1 M tanks covering 360,000 ac of which
nearly 40% are classified as derelict.
3.      GOB owned ponds, as distinct from joint family owned fish ponds,
offer an excellent potential for cooperative fish farming. Some of the
landless fish cooperatives established so far have demonstrated that with
credit, training and extension, they can produce good yields of fish.
However, several constraints impede proper exploitation of the full poten-
tial. These are: delays in issuance of a long term lease to these coopera-
tives; improper excavation of derelict ponds under Rural Works Program (RWP)
and poor extensicn support. Only recently has GOB finally taken a policy
decision to give priority to landless cooperative societies for issuing
leases to GOB owned fish ponds. The lease period has also been fixed at 10
years.
4.      Fish fries and fingerling of the popular species -- 'Katla,' 'Rohui,'
'Mrigal,' 'Calbaus,' Catfish and Chinese Carp -- would improve as the
hatcheries in Jessore (under IDA financed Oxbow- Lake Fisheries Project),
Raipur (under IDA financed Yarnafuli Irrigation Project) and an ongoing
UNICEF assisted project are completed. Training facilities are also avail-
able at these centers where selected members of these cooperatives can be
trained. To overcome problems faced in the past when pond excavation was
done before cooperative groups were established, BRDB now establishes
cooperatives and ensures their registration before ponds are excavated. In
the past, ponds have been excavated under RWP and the experience with the
cost and quality of excavation has rnot been fully satisfactory. Potential



-117-                         ANNEX 3
Appendix 1
Page 2
returns from pond fisheries are judged to be sufficiently high that the past
practice of providing 50% of the cost as a grant is not considered necessary.
Thus, the project would introduce a MT credit program for BSS to develop
about 300 ac of GOB owned derelict fishponds for which the BSS would be given
leases which extend for a minimum of 10 years. Extension support would be
provided by Thana Fishery Officer, one of whom is being posted in each thana
and GOB has launched special training programs for these officers.
Beef Fattening and Livestock
5.      This activity has been a popular one in all ongoing rural poor
programs. Cattle are generally looked after by women and children. Most
livestock graze on roadside grasses, marginally supplemented by concentrate
feed, the cost of which does not exceed the value of the cowdung. Marketing
the cattle or milk is no problem. So far, TCCA was trying to operate a self
insurance scheme to protect the borrowers from the financial risk arising
from the death of the animal. More recently, a general cattle insurance
scheme has been agreed between BRDB and the Sadharan Bima Corporation, to
operate in special projects. The premium for this insurance is set at 5% of
the purchase value of the cattle and is to be paid out of the loan amount.
6.      The project would provide credit for a member to purchase either a
mature cow for milking or a young calf if he or she wishes to fatten it. The
field staff of the Directorate of Livestock will, as now, inspect the cattle
being financed, and vaccinate them and also supply to BSS members, seeds and
planting material of lencaena bucocephala (Ipil Ipil) for planting either on
homesteads or other common areas. Efforts to introduce chemically treated
straw as cattle feed have been successful under BRDB's Noakhali Rural
Development Project, assisted by DANIDA. This concept is now being
propagated through demonstration units located in the TTDC.
Weaving
7.      This activity has been pursued by landless weavers in a number of
ongoing programs. Some socioeconomic 1/ indicators of handloom weaving are
given below:

8.      Handloom weaving is carried out intensively in Dhaka, Pabna, Comilla,
Tangail and Chittagong Hill Tracts but a large number of weavers also exist
in other parts of the country. Unlike other cottage industries, incidence of
wage employment is quite high in handloom weaving. BHB in its surveys has
found that the economic conditions of weavers have deteriorated in recent
years as prices of raw materials have increased while flow of institutional
credit has not been established. The major products, sarces, and 'lungee,'
are readily marketed locally in the rural areas.
9.      According to BHB, there exists a distinct potential to promote this
activity in some selected pockets, mainly in Barisal and Khulna. The project
would provide loomless weavers with term credit to procure semi-automatic
looms and for working capital. BRDB would enter into a contract with BHB for
(a) identifying areas of concentration of loomless weavers, (b) providing
input supply support, extension services and training facilities. BHB has
already set up yarn distribution centers in two thanas of Khulna and Barisal
districts and these would be used under the project. BHB would also appraise
the investment plans of BSS for this activity.
Oil Milling
10.     This activity is widely carried out in areas where mustard and
coconut is grown. In 1980/81, area under mustard was 500,000 ac and coconut
over 70,000 ac. The present production of edible oil seeds meets less than
one-fourth of domestic requirement. In FY80, about Tk 11.53 M was spent on
import edible oils and seeds.
11.     Some socioeconomic indicators of oil milling are presented below:
Family                            Contribution
Rural      Labor in      Female    Capital/ to value added          Labor
Industrial  Total Labor  Partici-   :Worker        by Rural       Productivity/
Employment   Employed    pation        Ratio    Industries            Hour
(%)          (%)         (%)         (Tk)         (%)               (Tk)
2           89           43        100-250        1                1.26-2.00
Most oil milling is done by the traditional ghani (oil pressing machine).
Most rural oil millers do not possess bullocks to pull the ghani but use
family labor.  About 75% of the millers procure raw materiaTlsdirectly from
cultivators and 90% sell the oil directly to consumers. Major constraint
identified by rural oil millers has been the lack of credit for investment
and working capital.
12.     The project will provide MT credit to about 1,500 oil millers
organized as BSS to acquire oil presses and bullocks and for working capital.
The potential to promote oil milling is good in districts of Barisal and
Mymensingh

Supplies of mustard and oil seeds should improve as new varieties are intro-
duced by BARI, based on successful introduction trials completed under the
IDA financed Agricultural Research Project, Credit 828-BD.
Rickshaw Pulling
13.     Rickshaw -- manually operated tricycle -- is a convenient means of
transport in the rural areas. Rickshaws are generally owned by relatively
wealthier persons and rented out to rickshaw pullers at rates (Tk 35 per day)
which are considered high by the rickshaw pullers. Many ongoing rural poor
programs have successfully extended credit to landless people to purchase and
operate their own rickshaws. As rural economic activities increase, demand
for rickshaws will also increase.
14.     The project would provide MT credit to about 3,050 members of BSS to
purchase rickshaws. An insurance scheme would be established by each TCCA to
protect the borrowers from the risk of credit default in case of serious
damage to the rickshaw.
Cane and Bamboo Work
15.     This activity is carried out all over the country.  The items mainly
produced are mats and baskets for which there is great demand in the rural
areas. Some socioecnomic indicators for this activity are given below:
% of Rural  % of Family                     Capital:          Labor
Industrial    Labor        % of Female        Worker       Productivity
Employment  Employed        Participation  Ratio (Tk)        Hour (Tk)

16.     Major constraints identified in the Rural Industry Survey on the
expansion of this activity were the lack of working capital and also the need
for skill training in product diversification. The project would provide
skill training and credit for working capital to about 1,500 artisans as
members of BSS. BSCIC, under a contract with BRDB, would supply quality
tools and equipment, train members in improved techniques, provide market

Appendix 1
Page 5
information to encourage the development of new products and appraise the
investment plan of BSS for this activity.
Carpentry
17.     Rural carpenters produce simple wooden furnitures, bullock carts,
agricultural and non-agricultural implements and country boats. Labor
productivity in this activity is one of the highest among rural occupations
and rural demand for these is highly elastic and likely to build up as
incomes increase. The project would provide to about 1,000 members of BSS
credit for investment and working capital. BSCIC under a contract with BRDB
would supply standard tools and equipment, training facilities, as needed,
and appraise the investment plans of BSS for this activity.
Pottery
18.     This is a traditional family based occupation.  There are at present
about 100,000 pottery workers in Bangladesh, about 50% of whom are women.
This activity provides for about 61% of rural industrial employment. There
are infinite variety of pottery products ranging from utilitarian ones to
decorative items. Pottery products have both domestic and foreign markets.
BSCIC is assisting village potteries by giving technical advice about
soft-glazed pottery, providing designs for new products for glazing and
testing clays from different regions for identifying their best use.
19.     This activity is carried out extensively in the project area, espe-
cially in Khulna and Barisal districts. The project would provide credit
for improved kilns and working capital. BSCIC under a contract with BRDB
would assist in selection of villages suitable for this activity, provide
skill training and technical expertise to upgrade pottery products and
appraise the investment plans of BSS for this activity.
Irrigation Assets for the Rural Poor
20.     Irrigation assets are generally owned by those who own land.  As a
consequence, the benefits of increased production due to irrigation tend to
accrue to landowners. Several NGO's like BRAC and Proshika and more
recently, BRDB, have launched programs to provide irrigation assets to land-
less and marginal farmers who sell water and in this manner supplement their
incomes. Several women have also acquired HTW for irrigation purposes.
21.     The project would provide STW and LLPs on MT credit to rural poor
groups who are interested in operating these assets for providing irrigation
water to others.

21 Full development yields under the project are expected to be reached in three years time, once irrigation
becomes available.
/ Yields in areas under IMP are higher.  It is expected that due to the project, yields in these areas would
be between 5-10% higher than in non-IMP irrigated areas. For the purposes of the analyses, it is assumed
that yields would be between 5-6% higher in the IMP project areas, due to activities undertaken through
the project.
j/  It is assumed that 50% of draught power requirements are hired.

I/   For the purposes of IRR calculations all benefits and costs, except
investment, are deferred by one year, and the incremental working
capital stream is introduced. This is to allow for time lags
occurring between incremental costs and benefits.
g/   Life of engine 5 years, and pump 10 years; salvage value of 10%
assumed.
S/  See Annex 5, Table 3.
A/   Assuming two cropping seasons, working capital is estimated at 50%
of the incremental operating cost of the following year. Working
capital is recovered at the end of the project period.
S/  Medium Term Credit at 14  p.a. interest, to cover 90% of investment
cost, with one year grace period and maturity period of 9 years.
*S/ Medium Term Credit to finance replacement engine, assumed to be
recovered in 5 years for the purposes of this analysis.
il   Short Term Credit at 17.5% p.a. interest, to finance cumulative
incremental working capital.
8/   Farmer's contribution of 10% to investment cost.
9/   Average farmer assumed to have a holding of one acre.
10/ Based on minimum consumpt:ion requirements of 15.5 ounces per day
and a family size of 6 (4 adult equivalent).
11/ Deficits reflect families holding an average of 1 acre, either living
below the minimum subsistence levels, or having to supplement income
from other sources.

j Details are available in project file. Profiles given here are for a selection of the activities likely to be taken up under the project.
21  In all cases financing is required in Year 1 of the activity.  Medium Term loans are at 14% interest p,a., and working capital Short Term
loans at 17.5% p.a.
/ As varying periods are required to reach full development for the different activities, figures in parenthesis show average net cash inflow p.a.
over the total period of investment.
A/  Present income in most cases is assumed to be obtained from working as hired labour.  Based on various data, it is assumed that on average a
landless person is working about 125 days in a year at an average wage rate of Taka 12 per day (wage rates vary between Taka 10-1S per dav).
/ In computing Internal rates of return, all benefits and costs, with the axception of Investment and Working capital costs, were deferred by one
year to allow for time lags between incremental costs and benefits.
/ Investment required is per acre of pond; cash flow figures are expressed as per member, assuming a group of 20.
/  The activities would not involve foregoing present income.
8/  All loans fully repaid before reaching full development.
