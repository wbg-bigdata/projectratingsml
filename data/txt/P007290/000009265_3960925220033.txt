Attached is the- Project Completion Report on flati - Fourth Education and
Training Project. (Cr. 1592-HA) prepared by the Latin Americ and the Caribbean
Regonal Offce. No comments hav bee recived from the Borrower.
The PCR give an adequate accont of the project experience. Its
preparation was made diffcult by the impossblity of sendin a.mission to the countryan
by the acute lack of data.
When IDA suspended dbusmnsto Haiti in the wake of the September
1991 coup, 20 percent of the SDR 10.4 nlmilo Credit remained undisbursed and was
cacele  ith the Closure on March, 11, 1993.
While hardiy any data are available on projectipeetto other thn
thos relati  to covenants and dibreet,ther cam be litlPdut that the pojwets
overal achievments are unsatisfactor, its nstitution buildig resuts neglgible and thie
sustanabilty of the fimite development impeac unftkey. Mhi was all but inevitable given
the extreme volatility of county conditions (with nine Goverments following one anothe
since the st  of te project in 1985).
N  audit is planned.

ii    The policalbul    e which followed the Foru   1986 ose of Prsidt
Duvalier had an adverse effec on proect      ion (pam  11). Durn  1986-90, the
education refm became ts             of nine ministers of education.  h led to lack
of rong, continu om mimet t          form, as ministes came to power with their own
agndas nd wero m     p      d  with i pitical survival As a result% the projec and

importat obdacle to pject        tti, feling delays (par. 15). Whle tBank
team sougt auances during nepda   on the timely provision o fiuds, in pracice this
did not occur, and IDA agreed to Inc    its dre of some ci work activities. In pte
of the imporbtnce attce to ag          in-house procur t cap tes in the Projtt
Completion  Report (PCR) for the prvo   IDA-funded educaon    in, he pject stil

'staff unovee and 'lack of stog polit    swp    for the eduation re' shoud hae
also ben added to the Ist (pam  1'7).
vii   The analysis of prject results has been hampeed by the inabit to cy Ou  Id
work, de to the susxnsion of IDA acviis, and to lack of detl  inran  on prjct

Soon Omeprjec              theMinistry of ,ducaton took away some of theduatof

Sutanalitywas also hanpered by the lac of strong political commitment and
community parcipation, and extensve Wace o in    t    consun (e.g.,
procurement agents, fanci analysts), which did not res  in a tnusfer of
knowledge to local staff. Against te  neatv facors, it must be emphsised that
the IDA prect did contribute to edcatond          and In its absence, litle

X.   The lessom    ned from th pect  a  24), which  n be addressed in
the desig and supeisi  of future IDA education proet can be      sdzed 
follows:
(a) Political comtment and comust be mobiUizd at an
eadystage of project prepation, even if this imflies shoit delays in
lning new projects. IDA (ould request eviden  of      k    through
'up front' polic acdons. Community artiI    in the mannt  d
Mahah        'Of sCOho lkas we las i nthCe t     of the e    is a
cric  eement which must be    porat  ito fur prjects.
(b) An  t donal cocsultan sbould be rearuied as  si      Poje%
,Managers to eure smooth projec impo and recuiment of
qu ed personnel, to mitigae the adver  efets of staff turnover, and to
fiwclhket a tsero mangeia and               sk 
(c) A higher prirty should be gie in proje  desi  to        loal
procurement expeise at the Pjct l    nta  Unit, as aleady
ggedd under the Tird Eation Proec PCI. Pariu        should
be devoted to staff training at an eay  age of project pepioand an
international procurement agent should be contacted for the init  years of
project imple, and be given th explicit mandateto tn local staff.
(d) Future projects suld have tghter fian    contols, ensuring that funds
are better accountd for. No special accounts should be set up with IDA
fiuds until appoprae procedus ar put -i place to eo.sumre      in
the           anmtd utlizationo project funds
(e) A concetted effort shoud be made to ensure contnuty of IDA task
