    3. Program Description

3.a Description of the Program

1.      Tanzania launched the participatory Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) in 1999 with the
preparation of an interim PRS followed by the approval of a full PRS in 2000. The PRS built on the
1997 National Poverty Eradication Strategy (NPES), which set out long term poverty reduction goals
consistent with international development goals, and the medium term expenditure framework
(MTEF), which focused on resource allocation to the priority sectors.

2.      The PRS has focused on three main areas of outcomes: (i) reducing the breadth and depth of
income poverty, including reducing basic needs poverty and food poverty with a particular focus on
rural areas where poverty is more prevalent; (ii) improving the quality of life and social well being:
this entails improving human capabilities, enhancing longevity and survival, and social well-being
(social inclusion and personal security), improving nutrition, and containing extreme vulnerability
(mainly through safety nets); and (iii) creating an environment conducive to development that can be
sustained. The environment encompasses macroeconomic stability and good governance.

3.      The first and third area entail cross-sectoral and institutional measures and the second is
primarily dealt with through sector-specific interventions in areas such as health, education and water
which are designated as priority sectors. As part of the PRS process the government has prepared,
realigned and approved sector development programs for basic health, basic education, agriculture and
water. These now provide the framework for supporting the implementation of the PRS targets that are
specific to the sectors.

4.      The first, second and third PRS progress reports were endorsed by the Bank's Board on
November 27, 2001, May 29, 2003 and June 2, 2004, respectively. At present, the Government of
Tanzania is in the final stages of preparing its second PRSP (i.e. the National Strategy for Growth and
Reduction of Poverty - NSGRP). A second draft of the NSGRP was presented to stakeholders during
the Poverty Policy Week in early November 2004. It covers the period (2004-2008) and builds on the
achievements and lessons of implementing the first PRSP (2000-2003).

3.b. Description of the Operation

5.      The implementation of the above reform program is supported by a series of Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and PRSC-1 is the first in a series of three single tranche
operations. PRSC-1 was approved by the IDA Board on May 29, 2003. Programmatic adjustment
lending was proposed under the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) to support the
implementation of policies and institutional development programs for sustainable growth and poverty
reduction. PRSC-1 selectively supports the implementation of key priority areas of Tanaznia's
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The key feature of the PRSC-1 operation is that it focused on cross
cutting and institutional issues. In coordination with other external assistance programs, the PRSC-1
supported Tanzania's effort to scale up growth, broaden the impact of growth on reducing poverty and
improve access to and quality of public services. The operation aimed to support actions to raise the


                                                     3

level of private investment, enhance competitiveness and productivity of the Tanzanian economy
create an attractive environment and reduce bottlenecks in the growth of the rural economy and
support cross cutting reforms in public sector management.

6.       The design of the PRSC takes into account requirements for coordination and harmonization
with other development partners particularly the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS) donors.
The motivation for this effort derives from the clear desire of both GoT and the development partners
to ensure that all operations adopt :

     · a clear poverty focus guided by the homegrown PRS,
     · coherence in policy dialogue at cross-cutting levels and in sector wide programs,
     · enhanced efficiency in policy dialogue and performance assessment and
     · enhance flexibility and predictability of resource flows.

7.       PRSC-1 has been harmonized with the PRBS with respect to both substance and process. The
Policy Action Framework(PAF)/Policy matrix, including the set of prior actions and triggers for
PRSC-1 was developed in close cooperation with the government, the PRBS donors and the Bank. As
part of the support to the PRS and in the context of the PRSC-1, the Government has carried out the
following key policy actions :

4. Achievement of Objectives and Outputs

8.      The assessment of progress under PRSC-1 has three core elements. Firstly, progress in the
implementation of the PRS is assessed in the second PRS progress report with a focus on outcomes.
Government has developed a list of key indicators which are also part of the PRSC assessment to
monitor results. Secondly, budget formulation and implementation is assessed in the context of PER
process through the external evaluation. Finally, government, PRBS donors and the Bank jointly
reviewed progress in the implementation of the PRSC supported reform agenda during the annual
review.

9.      Overall PRS implementation: The Second PRS progress report (covering the period July
2001-2002) and the related Joint Staff Assessment (Report No. 25859), which were presented to the
Board together with PRSC-1, confirm that Tanzania continued to make significant progress both in the
implementation of the country's PRS, and in further refining the strategy. With respect to policy,
sound macro-economic management and further articulation of the key agricultural and rural strategies
are highlighted. Progress against the targets set out in the PRSP has been generally good, with the
growth and education targets surpassed, but slower-than-hoped for progress on health indicators.

10.     Public expenditure performance: The government-led, participatory Public Expenditure
Review and Medium Term Expenditure Framework processes are the key mechanisms for translating
the PRS into annual budgets. The FY03 PER (Report No. 26807-TA) shows that real per capita
spending in the sectors and areas defined as pro-poor has more than doubled between FY99 and FY04.
The PER also suggests important improvements in public finance management, but points towards
remaining weaknesses in fully aligning sector spending plans with the PRSP.


                                                       5

11.     Implementation of actions identified in the Performance Assessment Framework: The
government has satisfied all original triggers and benchmarks related to PRSC-1. Under the
Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Tanzania and the donor group providing
programmatic support to the implementation of the PRS, progress in implementing the actions in the
Performance Assessment Framework was reviewed during the joint annual review in October 2002
and the mid-year review in March 2003. Both reviews assessed overall progress as being satisfactory.
Policy measures undertaken under PRSC-1 are discussed in Table 1 in Annex A. Given the lag in
translating policy actions into impacts, outcome achievements will be discussed in the programmatic
ICR for the last PRSC of the series.

12.     Next Planned Operation: PRSC-2 was approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors
on July 29, 2004 upon completion of all prior actions. Overall progress in the implementation of the
PRSP and the Performance Assessment Framework remains satisfactory and PRSC-3 is under
preparation.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

13.     Strong leadership from the top and broad ownership of the reform agenda by government were
critical factors in the progress achieved under PRSC-1. Continued political and macro-economic
stability created a conducive environment for the implementation of PRSC-1.

14.     The comprehensiveness of the reform agenda stretched the very weak capacities in
Government to their limit. Complementary technical assistance was thus important in facilitating the
implementation of the reform program, together with efforts to strengthen public sector capacities and
incentives.

15.     An important aspect of the Tanzanian program is also the progress in donor harmonization
achieved with PRSC-1. Achievements include both greater consistency in the government-donor
dialogue as well as a reduction in transaction costs which is important, given government's weak
capacities.

6. Bank and Borrower Performance

16.     Bank Performance : Overall Bank performance has been satisfactory. PRSC-1 was prepared
by the country team with significant contributions by country office staff (TTL based in the country
office) which played a crucial role in both substance (by providing local knowledge) and contribution
(coordination with Government, donors and HQ). Cross sectoral cooperation and coordination have
been effective. The operation complied with all relevant Bank environmental and business policies.
The Bank through its country office presence under the direction of a proactive Country Director has
provided an effective voice to implement the series of PRSC's through its lending policies outlined in
the CAS. Through direct supervision on the ground, Bank resident staff helped ensure the smooth and
successful supervision of the operation.

17.     The interaction with the IMF was also satisfactory, with the Bank complementing the Fund's
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility. In addition, the team also cooperates with multilateral and
bilateral donors to ensure an appropriate division of responsibilities in support of the country's PRS.

18.     Borrower's Performance : The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania played an
active role in the preparation of the Credit under the direction of the Senior Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Finance and the sense of program ownership was strong among the government officials.
Reflecting this strong ownership, the government implementation of the program was effective and
satisfactory. The PRSC group maintained a continuing economic dialogue with Bank and PRBS
donors, coordinated and monitored the program under the direction of the Senior Permanent Secretary
and helped carry out the policy actions called for in PRSC-1 before Board presentation and
effectiveness. Government of Tanzania was proactive in meeting the requirements called for by the
Credit.

7. Findings and Implications for Subsequent Operation(s) in Series

19.     In Tanzania, a stable political environment has contributed to the successful implementation of
macroeconomic and structural reforms. The forthcoming presidential election in October 2005 may
divert attention from macroeconomic management and slow down market oriented structural reforms.
However, the government appears to be committed to sustain the reform program over the medium
term by improving outreach activities to broaden consensus on the direction of reforms.

20.     Development and implementation of a common performance assessment framework and a joint
review process, which harmonizes general budget support of 12 donors, is a major achievement. At
the same time, it also poses significant challenges for the Bank to adjust its internal requirements to
the government-led harmonization process on the ground.

21.     Weaknesses in government processes such as the poverty monitoring system or the budget
system impact directly on the ability of the PRSC program to present adequate results orientation and
monitoring frameworks. It will be important to continue focusing on improvements in the underlying
government processes rather than attempting to circumvent these problems and weaknesses by
developing separate PRSC processes.
