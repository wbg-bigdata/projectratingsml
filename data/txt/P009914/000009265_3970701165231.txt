Project
Description:    The project would build on a successful dialogue between
GOI and the Bank on cement subsector strategy and policy
and support broadly the GOI thrust of liberalization of



- vi -
key productive subsectors. It will enable the cement
industry to modernize its facilities, reduce operating
costs, meet environmental standards, train operating
personnel and generally improve its competitiveness in
preparation for the intended policy of complete or
virtually complete decontrol of pricing and output by the
end of the Seventh Plan period in 1989/90. To this end
the Project would assist six private sector cement plants
(Associated Cement Companies' Madukkarai and Shahabad
plants, Birla Jute and Industries Satna plant, India
Cements Limited Sankarnagar plant, KCP's Macherla plant
and Sri Digvijay Cement Co. Limited, Sikka plant) and one
public sector plant (Cement Corporation of India's
Mandhar plant), in a conversion from the inefficient wet
process technology to modern dry process, precalciner
technology (Part A). In addition, the Project would
support smaller scale rehabilitation and modernization
investments at other cement plants in need of improving
energy efficiency, productivity and meeting environmental
standards and in improving marketing and distribution
systems (Part B). Finally the Project would support
training programs, both at individual company levels
(Part CO) and for the industry as a whole (Part C2), and
provide technical assistance for project management,
training and curricula development.
Benefits & Risks: The Project will allow the seven converted plants of six
well-run, progressive and efficient cement producers to
improve fuel efficiency by 42% on the average while
increasing production by 46%. The seven plants will
demonstrate to the rest of the industry the benefits of a
well-designed application of modern technology. The
pre-tax financial internal rate of return on the six
conversion projects for which appraisals have been
completed ranges from 18% to 37%; post-tax incremental
financial rates of return are higher, and range from 22%
to 45%, due to the substantial tax incentives provided by
GOI for new investment. The seventh plant is also
expected to show similar rates of return based on the
preliminary estimates of costs and benefits. The other
components of the loan will permit a number of other
cement plants to carry out minor modernization and/or
rehabilitation projects and improve their performance in
respect of energy efficiency, productivity and
environmental control. The technical assistance
component will encourage the cement industry to focus on
and address the critical problem of training a sufficient
number of plant operators in the skills required to
operate the sophisticated modern cement plants. No
specific risks are envisioned except those created by
infrastructural problems such as rail service, coal and
power supply which affect most sectors in India.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested % Bank loan of
US$165 million equivalent to help finance the conversion of seven existing
wet-process cement plants, of which six are in the private sector, to the
modern dry process technology (Part A). In addition, GOI has requested a
separate Bank loan of US$35 million to ICICI as a line of credit for
smaller scale modernization investments in proven technology, energy
conservation and environmental control at a number of other plants, mainly
in the private sector (Part B), as well as finance a program of technical
assistance and training to support technology transfer and development in
the cement industry (Part C). Part A of the Project consists of the
conversion of the following units: Associated Cement Companies (ACC)
(Shahabad plant, Karnataka and Madukkarai plant, Tamil Nadu); Birla Jute
Industries (Satna plant, Madhya Pradesh); India Cements (Sankarnagar plant,
Tamil Nadu); KCP Ltd. (Macherla plant, Andhra Pradesh), and Sri Disvijay
Cement Company Ltd. (Sikka plant, Gujarat), all in the private sector; and
Cement Corporation of India (CCI) (Mandhar plant, Madhya Pradesh). An
overall capacity increase of around 46Z would be achieved with the
introduction of modern dry process technology.
1.02      Project financing requirements, including price escalation,
contingencies and interest during construction, are estimated at
US$470 million, of which about US$112 million equivalent would be in direct
foreign exchange and about US$99 million in indirect foreign exchange. The
Bank loan, therefore, would cover nearly 95% of the foreign exchange and
44% of the total financing requirements. The balance of US$270 million
will be provided by term loans from the two major financial institutions,
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) and
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) and a blend of internally
generated funds, new equity and convertible and non-convertible debenture
issues.
1.03      Bank involvement in the Project arose from initial discussions
with the Government in June 1979, and Bank missions in September and
November 1979 to study the cement industry in detail. The major
recommendations contained in the Cement Subsector Report (Report
No. 3141-IN) with respect to improvements in pricing policies, energy
conservation and modernization in the industry have been instrumental in
promoting subsequent policy changes that have stimulated the large increase
in private investment in the subsector. In June 1980, the Bank appraised a
project comprising a major expansion in the public sector but processing
was discontinued when agreement could not be reached with GOI on the timing
for the implementation of pricing policy reforms. However, following
further discussions within the Bank, with GOI and the cement industry
representatives, it was decided to move away from a concept involving only
capacity expansion in the public sector to one of supporting already
establishad plants in the private and public sectors in introducing
measures aimed at energy conservation, improvement of the environment and



cost reduction. Project appraisal was completed in May and September
1985. Staff from ICICI and IDBI participated in the appraisal.
II. INDIAN CEMENT INDUSTRY _/
A. Historical Development
2.01      Cement manufacturing is a well-established industry in India,
accounting for about 3.5% of total production in the industrial sector. In
1984/85, the gross value of cement output (at selling prices less taxes and
subsidies) has been estimated at Rs 18,900 million (US$1,588 million)
representing about 1.0% of the year's GDP at: factor cost. Cement sector
employment in 1983/84, including those employed in the limestone quarries,
was over 100,000 or around 1.2% of total employment in the organized
industrial sector in India; employment in cement plants alone was over
70,000 or 0.8% of total industrial employment.
2.02      India's first cement plant was set up in 1914.  The industry grew
only slowly until the mid-1930s, when a policy of discriminating protection
to incipient industries was enacted, thereby providing a stimulant for
growth. As a result, the cement industry expanded rapidly and capacity
reached 3.8 million TPY in 1950/51. This was followed by a period of
accelerated expansion between 1950-69. The growth of the industry slowed
down during the decade of the 1970s, when GOI's industrial licensing policy
restricted the expansion of larger companies, and pricing policy failed to
ensure an adequate return on investment. Between 1969/70 and 1973/74
(Fourth Plan), cement production capacity increased by about 5.7% per
year. Output, however, grew at only 1.5% per year due to various
infrastructure and input constraints - chiefly shortages of railway wagons,
interruptions in power supply and labor problems. Consequently, capacity
utilization averaged only 74% during this period. Consequent to the first
oil shock in 1973, the cement industry responded by increasing capacity
utilization immediately thereafter. During the Fifth Plan (1974/75 to
1977/78), increases in the retention price of cement were initially
inadequate to allow for a sufficient return on new investment and capacity
growth stagnated at around 2.6% per annum. Although substantial price
increases in 1975, 1977, and 1978 were enacted by GOI, capacity growth was
initially slow and did not accelerate until the late 1970s. Production
increases, however, averaged 7.2% per year due to higher capacity
utilization (over 88%).
2.03      The end of the Fifth Plan marks a watershed in the development of
the Indian cement industry. Changes in GOI pricing, output control and
distribution policies have been particularly significant in stimulating
rapid growth of the industry in the Sixth Plan period which started the
decade of the 1980s. At the start of the current decade, a gap remained
between potential and actual production due to poor capacity utilization in
1/   Recent performance and prospects of India's industrial sector is
discussed in Report No. 5593-IN, -India - Structural Change and
Development Perspectives,' dated April 24, 1985.

the industry, caused mainly by shortfalls in power availability ard labor
problems. As a result, and compounded by excess and growing domestic
demand, a significant black market emerged. Imports were canalized and
prices and distribution fully controlled. However, the encouraging
investment and production response to price increases in 1979 led to the
dual pricing and liberal imports policy announced in February 1982. As a
result, capacity and production increased further to the point where in
1984/85 there have been only nominal cement imports,2/ the black market
has disappeared and market clearing prices, the so called "non-levy" prices
have come down.
2.04      Installed capacity grew by nearly 10 a year during 1980-85, and
nearly doubled from the level at the end of the Fifth Plan. Although over
half the current installed capacity in the industry has been added since
1982, average capacity utilization declined to 72.7% mainly because of
disruptions caused by declining coal quality, shortages of coal,
electricity and rail wagon allotments, continuing maintenance and labor
problems and the start-up of new or expanded units. In order to counteract
the problems caused by interruptions in power supplies, the industry began
to install captive facilities, particularly in conjunction with expansion
and greenfield plants, and has sharply reduced its reliance on public power
generation capacity. On the other hand, due to their age and mechanical
condition, cement plants installed in the 1950s, and which still account
for about 30% of the total installed capacity in early 1985, row have begun
to experience lower capacity utilization and greater downtime. Problems
associated with high ash coal and declining coal quality in general have
become more acute in the older plants based on the wet or semi-dry process
technology. This has underscored the urgent need for modernization by the
industry as a whole.
2/ Imports peaked at 2.0 million tons in 1983/84 and dropped to
300,000 tons in 1984/85.

B. Present Structure of the Industry
2.05      At the start of the 1985/86 financial year, the Indian cement
industry comprised 107 plants, of which there were 73 integrated plants,
1 clinkerization unit, 6 grJnding units, 1 white cement plant and 26 mini
plants (i.e., clinker capacity less than 200 TPD) with a total ins lled
capacity of 42.6 million TPY. About 58% of the total kiln capacity was
based on the more energy-efficient dry or semi-dry processes, and the
balance (in 34 plants) on wet process technology. Kiln sizes employed in
the industry range from 30 TPD to 3,000 TPD; most plants are multi-kiln
plants. At present, there are 15 plants which, through the use of multiple
kilns, have annual cement capacities between 0.8 million and 1.6 million
tons. At least another six 1-million TPY plants are under advanced stages
of construction and are expected to go onstream by the late 1980s. At the
end of the Seventh Plan, over 35% of installed capacity will be provided by
12% of the plants in the 1.0 million ton-plus category, and a further 39%
of capacity by 212 of the plants in the 500,000-1,000,000 TPY category (see
Annex 2-1). The average size of plants will increase from 535,000 TPY in
1984/85 to 650,000 TPY by 1989/90, despite a substantial increase in the
number of mini plants (Annex 2-1).
2.06      The industry has been developed almost entirely by the private
sector which accounted for 82% of installed capacity at the start of
financial year 1985/86 (Annex 2-2), and for 86% of total cement production
in 1984/85.  Over 60% of annual output is controlled by a few major



industrial groups, namely, ACC, various branches of the Birla House, the
J.K. Singhania Group, Sahu Jain Group, Bangurs, and India Cements
(Annex 2-3).  Although the public sector'R entry into the industry goes
back several years - the first such plant was built in 1938 - significant
capacity was not added until the late 1960s and 1970s. At present, the
public sector provides about 14Z of India's cement output (Annex 2-3) and
is made up of the Cement Corporation of India (CCI), accounting for 6.6% of
domestic output, as well as eight smaller State Government-owned
companies. GOI has moved away from a deliberate policy of capacity
expansion in the public sector and CCI, which had been expected to attain
25Z of total installed capacity by the end of the Seventh Plan, will not
exceed about 9% (Annex 2-2). Mini cement plants employing mainly rotary
kiln technology now account for 2.22 of total installed capacity and
produced 2.1% of the 1984/85 output (Annex 2-4). About 68% of installed
capacity is located in the South and West regions. The trend in the next
five years is for further concentration of cement plant capacity in the
states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra
and Karnataka, mainly as a result of the extensive availability of
limestone and the relative ease of coal supplies. Over 95% of new capacity
will be added in the above states. Over 74% of installed capacity will be
concentrated in the Western and Southern Regions (Annexes 2-2 and 2-4).

b/ White cement plants and mini-plants are included in the private sector;

2.07      In 1984/85, three major types of cement accounted for 98% of the
total production: ordinary portland cement (OPC), 25%; pozzolana portland
cement (PPC), 53%; and portland slag cement (PSC), 15% of output.
Retention prices are nearly the same for all types of cement (para 3.13),
and the market has not been very demanding of product quality. Moreover,
as production costs are lower for PPC and PSC than for OPC, the share of
production of PSC and PPC has increased over the past five years by 43%
relative to OPC. This situation may be expected to change over the next
few years as decontrol measures are implemented.
2.08      Along with the growth in the cement industry, India has developed
substantial capabilities in cement equipment manufacture.  At present,
there are five large manufacturers of cement equipment and numerous small
manufacturers supplying components.  Together, these firms have the
capacity to supply annually the major portion of equipment for plants up to
a combined capacity of 3 million TPY, which is adequate to meet the bulk of
the Indian cement industry's expansion plans over the foreseeable future.
The largest plants delivered by the local industry to date include modern
3,000 TPD (approximately 1.0 million TPY) plants, although some
sophisticated components and instrumentation systems (up to 20-25% of total
equipment cost) still must be imported.
C. Prices, Costs and Viability
2.09      Cement prices have been subject to Government control.  Under the
dual pricing policy instituted in 1982, cement units (other than
mini-plants) are required to sell a specified portion of their output
at a fixed (levy) price; the remainder may be sold at the open market
price. The levy quota has been based on a percentage of rated capacity
with pre-1982 plants having to provide a higher share of their output as
levy cement. The levy cement is itself dispatched to different regions of
the country by a complex allocation process administered by the Office of
the Cement Controller. A system of freight equalization operates in a
manner to ensure a uniform levy price throughout the country, theoretically
compensating the regions furthest from cement plants for the additional
transport costs involved. The bulk of the levy cement allocations serve to
meet the requirements of central and state governments. The levy cement
retention pri_e (i.e. price ex-factory net of taxes and packing) was fixed
at Rs 339/ton in 1982, when the dual pricing scheme was put into effect and
it has been increased since then to Rs 379/ton. Retention prices (FOB
plant) for the non-levy cement, i.e., open market sales, which reflected
the scarcity of free sale cement in the early 1980s, have declined steadily
from around Rs 800-850/ton in 1982 to around Rs 600-650/ton today. This
drop in the free market price and the narrowing of the gap between the levy
and free market prices have come about mainly as a result of increasing
cement supplies in the open market. Stagnant government investment has
also slowed the growth of levy cement purchases and has resulted in higher
amounts available for sale in the open market. Imported cement in the
coastal areas has recently been sold for about Rs 60/bag (i.e.,
Rs 1,200/ton) including duties and taxes, or Rs 878/ton net of taxes and
duties.



2.10      The decontrol measuyes instituted by the Government in 1982 have
been accelerated further in recent months and the levy 'quota' was reduced
in June 1985 to 60% for pre-1982 plants and 40% for post 1982 plants. The
basis for the quota has also been changed from rated (or licensed) capacity
to actual production (see Annex 2-5). This change undoubtedly was aimed at
halting the industry-wide practice of underrating plant capacity to ensure
low volumes of levy cement and then operating the plant at greater than
100% of the nominal capacity. It is also expected to benefit older units
now operating at below 75-85% of rated capacity ard unable to benefit from
so called -sick unit" status 3/ for extended periods.  GOI has confirmed
that it intends to continue further reductions of levy quotas and changes
in levy price to bring it on par with the market price in order to
substantially achieve its objectives of enhancing efficiency, removing
distortion with regard to production, distribution and consumption of
cement and providing adequate incentives, through appropriate price
structure and levels, for capacity expansion and plant modernization needed
to develop the subsector to its full potential. GOI intends to achieve the
above objectives substantially by the end of the Seventh-Plan period, i.e.,
by March 1990. This would also coincide with the expected completion of
all project components and the coming on stream of all the converted plants
under the Project.
2.11      India continues to be an economic producer of cement, despite
steadily increasing capital costs of new installations and fuel and power
costs. The 1985 investment cost of a one-kiln plant of 1 million TPY
capacity is estimated at between US$90-120 per annual ton of cement in
India compared to about US$170-200 internationally. This substantially
lower investment cost in India is attributable to the high degree of
domestic manufacture, fabrication, and installation of cement plants at
competitive domestic labor rates, as well as to lower civil works and
engineering costs. The average Indian plant's operating costs, currently
estimated at US$30 per ton of unbagged cement (including depreciation and
interest charges) for the newer installed plants employing dry process
technology, has increased in recent years. They are now higher than costs
at large-scale, low-cost European producer plants in Spain and Greece (most
of which were set up in the mid-1970s), but are still comparable to costs
of plants in other European countries such as France, West Germany and UK.
Much of the Indian advantage in operating costs derived in the past from
the low price of Indian coal relative to fuel oil which was then being used
in many European plants, as well as the low wage rates for Indian labor,
which more than offset its lower productivity. This advantage has now
eroded, particularly for the older, wet process plants where average
operating costs are already much higher at US$45/ton. Further
deterioration will occur if urgent steps are not taken to modernize
existing plant and equipment, improve operational efficiency and product
3/   This permitted the older plants to be treated like post-1982 plants;
i.e., lower levy quota, so that the owners would have an incentive to
modernization/rehabilitation by increasing cashflow significantly.
The -sick status was only available for a maximum three-year period.

quality, institute better environmental control, and upgrade operator
skills. This objective of improved fuel efficiency, productivity and cost
minimization is the primary thrust of GOI's policy and strategy in the
Seventh Plan. Without this modernization, which has already begun in a
number of units, the industry, as a whole, cannot prepare itself to meet
the challenges of the changing market environment.
D. Key Subsectoral Issues
2.12      Pricing and decontrol have traditionally dominated the range of
issues confronting the Indian cement industry, particularly over the past
decade. The industry has been split on the issue of decontrol - smaller
single plant companies continuing to favor some controls and a maintenance
of the allocation system largely in its present form, the larger and/or
more aggressive producers favoring a totally decontrolled market. However,
a consensus appears to be growing in favor of the latter position, partly
in response to recent GOI overtures and liberalization measures that have
begun to be felt in other sectors of the economy. GOI had seriously
considered abandoning the dual pricing and control system at the start of
the current Plan period. However, partly in response, to industry concerns
on its state of preparedness to deal with an open market environment, GOI
has decided to proceed with decontrol in a gradual manner, and thus to
achieve the objective of substantial decontrol, only by the end of the
Seventh Plan, i.e., in 1989/90 (para 2.10).
2.13      The cement industry's current lack of readiness for total
decontrol is based on the continuing obsolescence of a large part of its
plant and equipment, the existence of nearly 42% of capacity still in the
wet process technology, the lack of significant marketing organization and
distribution systems, the inattention to product quality fostered by years
of cement shortages and output allocation, the inadequate attention to the
long-term development of the limestone resource base, the continuing
dependence on poor quality coal, and the lack of adequate industry-wide
operator training programs.
2.14      The first priority that is clearly felt is the upgrading of older
plant facilities, as a basic step to lower production costs and to match
the higher quality cement being shipped from the newer plants to an
increasingly sophisticated market. Operator training both for improving
maintenance of existing plant and for operation of newer technologies is
also of high priority. The proposed Project addresses these priority areas
through a three-pronged approach, i.e., large-scale process conversions,
smalle--scale modernizations and a technical assistance and training
package. As the market becomes more competitive, all producers will be
forced to bring cement quality closer to international norms (see also
para 3.17). The issue of limestone resource development is closely tied to
improvement of coal quality which can only be achieved by long-term
programs. The ongoing program of modernization in the coal sector, for
which assistance is being provided under a series of IBRD-financed projects



- 9 -
will address the coal quality problem on a broad basis.4/ Improvement in
coal quality would extend the life of limestone reserves, improve cement
quality and smooth out large variations in kiln operating conditions and
increase kiln refractory life significantly. The issue of improved
limestone resource management can be tackled only at a subsequent stage of
the industry's development. The issue of improved marketing and
distribution systems (see paras 3.11 and 3.16) is being addressed now, only
by the larger private sector cement manufacturers. As the pace of
decontrol accelerates in the coming years, industry in general will be
forced by competitive market pressures to build up and improve marketing
and distribution systems, including installation of bulk handling
facilities and ready mix batching operations at major consuming centers. A
final issue concerns the management and performance of cement units owned
by various State Governments. CCI, as the premier public sector unit, has
performed relatively well, considering its role of developing cement
manufacture in remote areas, which were shunned by the private sector, and
has developed a well-trained cadre and continues to be a major source
(besides ACC) of trained manpower to the rest of the industry. However,
State Government units have performed, in general, below the industry
norms. GOI's long-term concern is to improve the efficiency of these
plants so that eventual devolution to the private sector may be possible.
GOI also is pursuing a deliberate policy of diminishing the role of the
public sector in the cement industry by reducing and/or eliminating
proposed allocations in the Seventh Plan for expansion of CCI capacity.
2.15      An estimate of total financing needed for modernization of the
Indian cement industry has been prepared by CMA. At the start of the
1985/86 financial year, there were 34 wet process plants in operation. Of
these, 10 had already started conversion programs or were committed to
carrying out major investments; another 10 were planning conversions,
although commitments have not been made yet. Of the remainder, 7 plants
will not convert due to technical and/or economic reasons (dwindling
limestone resource, plant too old for economic conversion at the particular
location, more attractive expansion alternative at other plant locations,
etc.), and 7 plants have not made any plans. The estimated cost of
converting the 20 plants already committed or planned is about
US$1,100 million in June 1985 terms, based on average unit costs developed
under the proposed project. Modernization of other cement plants with
small-scale investments in specific process areas and introduction of
environmental controls could be expected to add another US$250-300 million
in financing requirements. In addition financing for new capacity
increase will require about US$1.5 billion at current investment costs of
about US$120 per installed ton. Thus, total financing needs of the
industry, if they are to meet the projected cement demand over the next
five years (see para 3.09), could exceed US$2.8 billion equivalent.
Although the industry, in general, is in good financial health, in part due
to the decontrol measures of recent years, and has sufficient tax and other
fiscal inducements from GOI for further investment and modernization, its
current level of internal cash generation will cover only about 25-30% of
4/   Dudichua Coal Project (Ln. 2393-IN) and Jharia Coking Coal Project
(Ln. 2498-IN).



- 10 -
the total financing requirement; the remainder must be raised in the market
place from the Indian financial institutions and external sources,
including the proposed Bank loan. In addition to demands for financing,
the modernization and expansion process will place heavy demands on trained
manpower, which will require special efforts both at the secondary
technical education levels prior to entry into the industry and at the
pO9 t-entry on-the-job levels. These concerns also are proposed to be
addressed under the Project.
E. Role of the Bank Group
2.16      The Bank's role in the preparation of the proposed Project
continues the active dialogue initiated under the 1980 subsector study.
The complex nature of the conversion programs, and the lack of significant
prior experience in India in such projects, led to the proposed structuring
of the project into two parts; the main part, channelled through ICICI and
IDBI in their traditional roles as lead financial institutions for the five
companies but with all subprojects fully appraised by the Bank; and Part B,
passing through ICICI as the financial intermediary, for the smaller scale
modernization programs. In this manner, Bank involvement has also resulted
in the use of international competitive bidding procurement procedures and
the limited turnkey- concept for major equipment supply packages under
Part A of the project (para 5.09), thereby opening the way for acquisition
of modern technology not yet readily available in India and the improvement
of plant installation and start up capabilities of the industry. Bank
involvement in the detailed appraisal of the six conversion subprojects
stressed the need to consider long-term company strategy in project design
and evaluation of options. The Bank has also played a leading role in the
introduction under the Project of electrostatic precipitators and bag
houses for satisfactory environmental control. The acceleration of
industry trends to greater energy conservation is also related to the
Bank's involvement in the subsector. In the future, the Bank's role will
be to redirect industry attention to the technological issues mentioned in
paras 2.12-2.14 and assist the subsector in realizing its long-term
potential.
2.17      The IFC has been active in the cement subsector since 1981, when
it made its first investment in a greenfield plant for Coromandel
Fertilizer Limited. Subsequent investments have included greenfield plants
and/or major expansions for the Indian Rayon Corporation Ltd., Modi Cements
Limited, Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing Company and the most recent,
Larsen and Toubro Limited. IFC has also been instrumental in arranging the
financing for large-scale greenfield and expansion plants for mainly new
entrants to the cement industry, encouraged by the liberalization of the
rules for entry for large industrial houses by the improving pricing policy
and decontrol situation and by an array of fiscal incentives offered by
GOI. The IFC-assisted portfolio covers about 4 million TPY of new cement
manufacturing capacity that is expected to be fully operational by 1989/90,
representing about 10% of present installed capacity and about 8% of the
expected capacity at the end of the decade. As IFC's cement portfolio now
represents nearly 32% of IFC's total exposure in India, it is likely that
IFC's role in financing new capacity in the cement subsector will be



- 11 -
somewhat lower in the next four to five years, or until the present wave of
new plants under construction is commissioned and attains steady state
operations. Modernization and rehabilitation will remain higher priorities
over the next five years.
III. THE INDIAN CEMENT MARKET: DEMAND, SUPPLY,
DISTRIBUTION AND PRICING
A. General
3.01      The main objective of the Project is to assist the Indian cement
industry in achieving higher operating efficiency by process conversions
and technological improvements and it will not alter the cement
supply/demand balance to any significant extent. The seven subprojects
combined would cause a net increase in production capacity of only
1.82 million TPY which corresponds to about 3% of the projected industry
capacity in 1988/89 and 1989/90 when most of the subprojects enter into
commercial production.
3.02      During the last two decades India has suffered from a continuous
shortage of cement which the industry was unable to close. To a limited
extent, part of the excess demand was met by imports, but during these many
years, a large unsatisfied demand has continued to exist. Cement
distribution was based on allocation, and a black market emerged. This
situation is changing rapidly due to the decontrol measures of the past
three years and the encouraging increase in cement plant investment. Since
1982, the industry's installed capacity has increased by 45% and supply and
demand are moving close to balance. The Planning Commission projects a
slight excess of supply for the near and medium term (para 3.09), but many
industry representatives still believe that the cement shortage will
continue, although to a lesser extent. The Bank's analysis supports that
view.
B. Apparent Consumption & Production
Apparent Consumption
3.03      Cement consumption in India increased from 14.6 million tons in
1974/75 to 30.5 million tons in 1984/85, representing an average annual
growth rate of 7.6%. There have been three distinct growth periods during
this time span - two periods of high growth, from 1974/75 to 1978/79 and
1981/82 to 1984/85, when consumption grew by 9.6% and 10.8%, respectively;
these two high growth periods were interspersed with a period of negative
growth (-2.4% annually) from 1978/79 to 1980181, when industry production
suffered because of chronic shortages of coal, power and transport
facilities. Table 3.1 below shows historical capacity, production,
consumption, export and import figures for the last ten years.

The low per capita cement consumption was most likely due to the persistent
cement shortage. The allocation system resulting from Government controls
on sales, distribution and imports prevented potential consumers from
acquiring cement and the cement producers had little incentive to promote
the sales of cement.
Cement Production
3.05      The production growth rate averaged 7.4% per year during the
decade from 1974/75 to 1984/85. As seen in Table 3.1 the yearly production
increased during the last three years from 21.1 million tons to
30.2 million tons, corresponding to a growth rate of 12.7%. This growth
rate parallels the 13.4% growth rate in installed capacity. Capacity
utilization during recent years has averaged close to 73% 5/ which is on
the low side. Problems with power supply, coal supply and rail service had
a major effect on the utilization factor during the years 1980-84, with
power supply being the most critical. The industry has alleviated some of
the problems with power supply by installing captive power-generating
facilities in the plants.
5/   100% capacity utilization is defined in India as obtaining an annual
production corresponding to 330 days of kiln operation at rated
capacity. By international definition it would be calculated as 90.4%
capacity utilization.

Forecast of Production
3.07      The production forecast is calculated from the indicated year-end
installed capacity, based on known commitments by the various cement
companies. The Bank forecast is more conservative, reflecting past
experience with project delays and historical capacity utilization rates.
The lower utilization rates also take into account the commonly expressed
concern regarding the ability of the railroads to meet the total national
demand during the Seventh Plan. On the positive side can be listed the
existing tendency to understate plant capacity for the new projects and on
the negative side the shortage of skilled personnel to operate the
sophisticated new plants.
Cement Demand
3.08      For demand projections the Planning Commission has relied on
regression methods using traditional variables (i.e., capital formation in
construction, gross domestic product, relative price of cement). However,
following the partial deregulation in February 1982, market and consumption



- 15 -
patterns have changed so drastically that the use of regression methods for
cement demand forecast is no longer applicable. Instead the demand
forecast must be based on the recent consumption trends following the
partial deregulation.
3.09      After two decades of cement shortage, unsatisfied demand is still
a factor and in April 1984, the Working Group for Cement Industry, Seventh
Plan (WG) estimated it to be 20% of apparent consumption. The Bank
appraisal assumes a much lower figure of 7% in the belief that higher
availability of cement during the last three years has helped to reduce
unsatisfied demand. While the actual growth in consumption during the last
ten years was 7.6% p.a., it rose to 10.8% p.a. during the last three years,
when partial decontrol was in effect. In particular, non-levy shipments
show an even higher growth rate as indicated in Table 3.4.
Table 3.4
India - Cement Dispatches, Levy and Non-levy
(million tons)

Total      24.04       26.12      29.12
Source:  Cement Controller (estimates).
Levy cement shipments have remained essentially constant and most sources
indicate that the public sector consumption is likely to remain flat at
approximately 15 million tons per year. Non-levy shipments have increased
at 27.6% p.a, and, as a percent of total shipments, increased from 34.2% to
45.9% during this period. Annex 3-2 shows non-levy shipments to 15
individual states 1982-85 and the non-levy growth rate for each state. The
growth rates for the 15 states average 38Z on a non-weighted basis, a
growth rate which obviously cannot be sustained over a long period. Part
of this increase has served to reduce the unsatisfied demand. The
appraisal mission has chosen a 9.5% p.a. growth for forecasting cement
demand on the grounds that, as deregulation progresses and an increasing
percentage of the cement production is sold in the free market (non-levy
cement), the cement manufacturers will actively promote sales of cement by
establishing proper distribution systems to reach markets and sectors
previously ignored (such as for instance the large rural private sector).
In addition concrete will be promoted against other road and construction
materials. The Bank demand forecast (based on actual 1984/85 apparent
consumption of 30.5 million tons and assuming 7% unsatisfied demand and
9.5% p.a. growth) is shown in Table 3.5, where it is compared to the
Planning Comnission estimates for the Seventh Five-year Plan. The Planning
Commission estimate uses a 6% p.a. growth and is based on a much higher
1984/85 demand.

Currently, the North and East are deficit regions and the West and South
surplus regions, and the forecasts show that this pattern is further
reinforced by 1989/90. The main reason for the regional imbalance is that
the major known deposits of limestone, the main raw material for cement
manufacture, are concentrated in the South and West. Cement plants



- 17 -
traditionally are located close to the source of limestone for
transportation considerations (it requires 1.3-1.5 tons of limestone to
produce 1 ton of cement). The North and East regions contain smaller
deposits of lower-quality limestone which are difficult to exploit. The
policy of freight equalization, which GOI has practiced since 1956, has
provided no incentives to the cement manufacturers to develop the more
difficult limestone deposits in the North and East. It is expected that
decontrol and elimination of freight equalization (para 2.10) will provide
the necessary incentives for the industry to consider much more carefully
the optimum location for both cement plants and cement terminals.
D. Marketing and Distribution
3.11      Government control of distribution and pricing of cement has been
in effect in India for many years (para 2.09). As discussed in para 2.10,
GOI policy is moving steadily towards complete decontrol of price and
output. However, in the short run, the remote deficit areas in India could
experience a sharp increase in cement prices as a result of decontrol and
consequent abandonment of the freight equalization system.6/ One way to
alleviaLe short-term hardship would be for GOI to subsidize explicitly
cement sales in remote areas until distribution systems improve and more
cement is available for wider distribution at lower cost to the industry.
3.12      As increasing amounts of cement enter the free market the present
cement distribution system is becoming inadequate. During the many years
of cement shortage under the cement controller's allocation system, cement
was sold long before shipping, and manufacturers saw no need to establish
distribution facilities and to maintain cement stocks away from the
plants. The requirements are different today as a much higher volume of
the cement is shipped to the free market without prior commitment by an end
user. The cement companies are now establishing warehouses adjacent to
rail spurs with a storage capacity on the order of 2,000-5,000 tons. The
cement is sold through stockists, who function both as a retailer and a
wholesaler. Some cement companies have chosen to develop a strong sales
staff who will operate the warehouses, while other cement companies prefer
to operate through independent wholesalers. The lack of inventory capacity
is creating problems in marketing. On a number of occasions the delay of
cement trains into Bombay has caused prices to fluctuate by 5-8% on a daily
basis, and these fluctuations are sometimes misread as price manipulation
by the manufacturers. The physical distribution is cumbersome, since 100%
of the cement is shipped in bags and all handling is manual. The
predominant packing material is jute bags which leak, and as a result the
customer cannot expect to receive the stipulated net weight. The industry
recognizes that as the free market develops, marketing and distribution
must become more sophisticated. The development of bulk handling
facilities and acquisition of related transport equipment will be
necessarily at a pace consistent with gaining market acceptance of bulk
6/  Under freight equalization, the freight cost for levy cement is
averaged for all shipments in India and charged on a per ton basis so
that consumers close to the point of shipping are subsidizing levy
cement consumers at locations distant to the point of shipping.

cement and ready-mix batch operations, particularly in the large urban
demand centers.
E.  Cement Pricing
3.13      Levy Cement.  The price of levy cement as bulk cement is
controlled at the FOB plant level. Including Rs 4/ton of allowed selling
and distribution cost, the present FOB plant price is Rs 364/ton for PPC
cement and RS 379/ton for OPC and other types of cement. A price-control
mechanism was established in 1981, which should assure the cement industry
a post-tax return of 12% on net worth according to defined assumptions.
When partial decontrol took place in February 1982. allowing a certain part
of the production to be sold in a free market (non-levy cement), it was
assumed that the weighted average price of levy and non-levy sales should
provide the same 12% return on net worth. CMA and GOI entered into an
understanding whereby levy prices would be adjusted periodically in
response to increases in input costs. In practice, GOI has not adjusted
levy prices at the same reae as input costs have increased and CMA has
claimed that the levy price is currently about Rs 85/ton below what it
should be according to the pricing formula.7/ However, it appears that
GOI has chosen to allow an increasing percentage of the production to be
sold as non-levy cement, rather than adjusting levy prices in line with
input cost increases. In fact, the average retention price to the
manufacturers has increased in accordance with the increasing share of
production sold in the open market. The gap between levy and market prices
has also decreased since mid-1982 from over Rs 500 to under Rs 300/ton now
(see Annex 2-5). Recent discussion between GOI and CMA have focussed on
the steep increases in input costs such as coal and power and the rapidly
escalating capital investment costs of new plants, which may be acting as a
brake on new investment in the industry. GOI is now considering other
policy initiatives (in addition to further decontrol) to stimulate new
investment which is needed if India is to close the gap between demand and
supply (para 3.09). Annex 3-4 shows the variation in the FOR stockist levy
prices over the last five years. Of the September 1985 price, the
manufacturer retains approximately 42%, and taxes and state and government
fees amount to 26%.  The price diff.,:ence of Rs 15/ton bet-een OPC and PPC
cements is quite unrealistic when compared to both manufacturing costs and
quality of the two types of cement and the industry anticipates that as the
market becomes competitive the share of PPC cement will drop drastically.
7/   As discussed in para 6.02, the average realization price of a
representative sample of cement plants is about Rs 655/ton (inclusive
of packing charges) which compares with an average manufacturing cost
of about Rs 536/ton bagged (including financial charges and
depreciation) for wet process plants established prior to 1982; and
about Rs 528/ton bagged due to the impact of expected cost savings
arising from modernization and conversion. The higher variable
operating costs of older wet plants is nearly balanced by the higher
depreciation and financial charges of the newer, modernized
installations. However, greenfield plants would reqdire a higher
margin to cover additional financial and depreciation charges
corresponding to approximately 50% higher capital costs as compared to
the typical converted plant.



- 19 -
3.14      Non-levy Cement.  At the time of partial decontrol, the cement
manufacturers voluntarily agreed to a price ceiling for non-levy cement,
which was Rs 60/bag (Rs 1,200/ton) In Kerala, Maharashtra, Goa, Jamam and
Kashmir and the Northeastern states, and Rs 56/bag (Rs 1,112/ton) for all
other states.  In recent months, CMA ceilings have been increased to
Rs 69/bag and Rs 64/bag, respectively.  As explained in para 3.11, these
are ex-stockist prices (exclusive of local taxes varying from 3-10%
depending on the state). However, short-term retail level fluctuations
have brought price levels to as high as Rs 85/bag in some urban areas such
as Bombay and Delhi. GOI has not intervened in such cases.
3.15      Table 3.7 shows a typical price buildup for levy and non-levy OPC
cement.

non-levy shipments. The premium can go as high as Rs 450/ton, and if this
non-levy cement had been sold at the ceiling price of Rs 69/bag
(Rs 1,380/ton) the premium would have been Rs 270/ton.
F. Imports
3.16      Imports have not been a major factor in the Indian cement
market. During the years 1978/79 to 1983/84 when shortage of cement was
most acute, annual imports peaked at 2 million TPY (corresponding to 10% of
apparent consumption) and in 1984/85 when the cement shortage had eased, it
fell to 0.3 million TPY (1%) as seen in Table 3.'. Cement imports are
controlled by GOI and, since 1983/84, are channeled exclusively through the
State Trading Corporation (STC). In the past, GOI authorized cement
imports to cover the expected shortfalls in domestic production. Since
1982, GOI has begun to use imports as a means of partial price
stabilization in the open market. The Indian ports are quite congested and



- 20 -
lack bulk handling facilities for cement. Therefore, cement must be
imported in bags with consequent high handling and transport costs. In
spite of the low (15X)tariff protection, this reduces the competitiveness
of imported cement except in and around the port cities. For example, STC
currently contracts for bagged cement at $27/ton FOB and $50-55/ton C&F.
After applying 15% duty, Rs 205/ton counter-vailing duty (excise duty),
Rs 100/ton for handling and adequate allowance for insurance, financing and
profit, the cement is sold FOB port city at Rs 60/bag, corresponding to
Rs 1,200/ton. This compares to Rs 1,050/ton for levy cement and
Rs 1,400/ton for non-levy cement. For inland consumption another
Rs 150-200/ton must be added to the price of imported cement and that would
remove any price advantage of imports.
3.17      Currently the approximately 20% higher strength of imported over
domestic cement is the main reason why mostly state and central government
agencies consumers are willing to pay Rs 150/ton extra for imported cement,
a difference of only 9% over the retail price of levy cement. In the
future, the quality factor will become less significant as the domestic
producers improve product quality in response to a more competitive
market. On the other hand, until bulk handling facilities and improved
distribution systems are available, imported cement will not be a
significant factor in reducing open market prices even in the port cities.
The present distribution structure and rapid increase in domestic
production does not provide sufficient incentives for development of bulk
import facilities. The lack of sophistication in the market also
discourages such a development in the short run.
3.18      In light of the above, GOI policy is to maintain import controls
on cement in such manner as to permit orderly development of domestic
marketing and distribution systems, while, at the sam time, providing
incentives for continued capacity buildup and quality improvements in the
market. GOI policy has been justified by the emergence of a much stronger
and modernized cement industry that is generally competitive by
international standards and remains an economic producer of cement
(para 2.11). Any sudden change in import policy and rapid increase in
imports would only cause dislocations in the existing marketing and
distribution channels, overload already congested port and rail facilities
and, lead to profiteering by middlemen. For the above reasons, there would
not be any significant economic gain to the country.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01      The project responds to the three pronged subsector strategy
outlined in para 2.14. Its first objective is to assist the cement
industry in improving operating efficiency of older wet process cement
plants, particularly as it pertains to fuel-efficiency. Rapidly increasing
coal prices have made it impossible for these old plants to rpmain
financially viable, and have made it necessary either to change to more
energy-efficient technology or shut down operations altogether. As
described in para 2.15, ten wet process plants are already committed to



- 21 -
conversion; of these three are under implementation and one has been
completed; the remaining six are the focus of the proposed project. The
seventh plant is a second phase of a plant conversion program, the first
phase of which was completed in early 1985. The feasibility studies have
clearly demonstrated their suitability with respect to raw material sources
and markets to be served. The second objective is to assist industry in
effecting other improvements in operating efficiency, environmental
controls, product quality, labor productivity and marketing and
distribution systems and in providing a part of the estimated funding
required over the next five years (para 2.19). Finally, the project aims
to assist the cement industry as a whole in upgrading plant operator
skills, organizing regular training and technical assistance schemes,
obtaining knowhow in specific areas such as plant start-up procedures,
computerized controls, and other aspects of modern cement plant operations.
B.  Project Description
4.02      The project consists of three parts, with Part A, the main
component, providing the financing for the seven plant conversion
subprojects, Part B, financing for smaller-scale efficiency improvement
projects and Part C, financing for technical assistance and training.
Part A
4.03      The seven subprojects, six in rhe private sector and one in the
public sector, comprise the following elements:
(a) conversion of the kiln system from wet process to dry process
preheater, precalciner system; and
(b) upgrading of the other plant process areas to assure sustained
plant operation at the new rated capacity.
In the six cases which have been fully appraised, all options for
conversion were identified and analyzed in order to select the most cost
effective approach. Typically the following areas were examined:
(a) capital costs; (b) future operating costs; (c) adequacy of raw material
reserves; (d) capacity of existing infrastructure; (e) market conditions;
and (f) ability to operate existing facilities during implementation. For
every subproject it was found that the optimum option comprised the
replacement of the existing old kilns with one preheater, precalciner kiln
of a somewhat larger capacity (on an average capacity was increased by
46%). All process areas upstream and downstream of the new kiln system
were examined for adequacy in relation to the new project capacity, and
deficient process areas were upgraded and rehabilitated. A brief
descriptior -f the project sponsors is given in Annex 4-1. More details
are present in the Project File Items 4-1-4-6). Subproject locations are
shown in Maps 19204 and 19205.
4.04      The seven subprojects entail a total production increase of
1.82 mil-ion TPY, corresponding to 46% of the present total cement capacity
of the s.x plants. This capacity increase is equivalent to 3.0Z of the
projected industry capacity in 1989/90. The average improvement in fuel



- 22 -
efficiency for the six subprojects already appraised is 42%. The basic
features of all subprojects are tabulated in Table 4.1 below. Detailed
project descriptions of the six already appraised are found in Annexes 4-2
to 4-7.

4.05      ACC - Madukkarai Plant.  The project comprises installation of
two additional flotation cells for the limestone beneficiation plant, a new
vacuum filter plant and a crusher/dryer for dewatering of the kiln feed,
new dry process kiln department (3-stage, preheater, precalciner kiln) and
a 6 MW diesel generator for captive power (corresponding to 32% of total
demand). The company controls two limestone deposits with total combined
reserves of 87 million tons, corresponding to 130 years of operation. The
deposits are difficult to mine and 70% of the limestone must undergo a wet
beneficiation process, resulting in a 35% moisture content of the kiln
feed.8/ The project employs a novel process for dewatering the kiln feed
to permlt utilization of a preheater, precalciner kiln. The drying process
relies on the preheater exhaust and the number of stages in the preheater
has been limited to three in order to obtain a high enough exhaust
temperature. As a result the fuel efficiency is approximately 15% lower
than for a 4-5 stage preheater. The inherent high cost of beneficiation
8/   The conversion is thus from an existing wet process to a semi-dry
process as rawmilling remains a wet process.



- 23 -
can be accepted for this project because of the favorable location of the
plant in relation to the market (details in Annex 4-2.)
4.06      ACC - Shahabad Plant.  New equipment under this project comprises
a limestone crusher, aerial ropeway for transportation of crushed
limestone, preblending facilities for limestone, new dry process rawmill
and kiln departments with efficient dust collection equipment, preblending
facilities for coal, one rotary cement packing machine. The present plant
includes an old 10 MW coal-fired power plant which must either be
rehabilitated or replaced in order to provide higher captive power
capacity. Including the reduced output of the old captive power plant and
new DG sets to be installed the plant will have captive power generation
corresponding to 63% of the 18 MVA required for the converted plant. ACC
controls 25 million tons of limestone reserves corresponding to 17 years of
operation of the new kiln. Another major deposit adjacent to the plant is
being prospected and will be leased as and when needed (details in
Annex 4-3.)
4.07      Birla - Satna Plant.  Major equipment purchases under this
project comprise some quarry equipment, dry process rawmill and kiln
department with high efficiency dust collecting and packaging machines.
One of the existing rawmills will be converted to a cement mill. The
company has ample reserves of good quality limestone corresponding to 26
years of operation. The company will have captive power-generating
capacity of 20 MW corresponding to 65% of the total combined demand of the
Satna plant and the adjacent Vikas plant, which commenced production in
1983 (details in Annex 4-4.)
4.08      CCI - Mandhar Plant.  Project purchases comprise quarry
equipment, limestone preblending facilities, new dry process rawmill and
kiln departments with efficient dust collection equipment, cement storage
silos, and a rotary cement packing machine. The existing rawmills will be
converted to cement mills. The plant has 2.4 MW of captive
power-generating capacity corresponding to 20% of the new power
requirement. The plant controls 29 million tons of limestone reserves,
corresponding to 45 years of operation. The plant has a contract with the
steel plant at Bhilai, 40 km from Mandhar, for the supply of 200,000 TPY of
granulated slag. CCI would have liked to double the contracted amount of
slag, but Bhilai Steel is unable to deliver more. Consequently CCI will
grind the incremental clinker production into pozzolan cement (details in
Annex 4-5.)
4.09      ICL - Sankarnagar Plant.  New equipment under this project
comprises a limestone crusher, limestone preblending system, new dry
process rawmill and kiln system with efficient electrostatic precipitator
for gas cleaning, clinker storage silo, a rotary packing machine and a 4 MW
diesel-generating plant. The plant will have 10 MW of captive
power-generating capacity corresponding to 40% of the total power
requirement. Currently 10X of the total kiln fuel consumed consists of
lignite and ICL intends to double that percentage to improve cement
quality. The limestone reserves amount to 25.5 million tons when mining to
a depth of o0 meters, and by mining to 72 m an additional 30.3 million tons
of reserves Jre added, and the reserves would suffice for 28 years of
operation (details in Annex 4-6.)



- 24 -
4.10      KCP - Macherla Plant.  Project purchases comprise quarry
equipment, new dry process rawmill and kiln departments which will use the
existing high-efficiency dust collection equipment, and two new rotary
cement packing machines. One existing rawmill will be converted to cement
mill. The company controls 32 million tons of limestone reserves
corresponding to more than 50 years of operation. The plant has not
experienced problems with power supply and the project does not include
provision for any captive power-generating capacity (details in Annex 4-7).
4.11      SDC - Sikka Plant.  The project would finance the company's
proposed second phase conversion of the Sikka plant, located in Jamnagar
district, Gujarat. The converted plant would have a clinker capacity of
1.77 million tons, an increase of 38X from its existing capacity of
1.285 million tons, from an existing 600 tpd wet process kiln and a
recently converted 2,000 tpd dry process kiln. The wet process kiln would
be replaced by another 2,000 tpd dry kiln. Cement capacity would increase
from 1.025 million tpy to 1.51 million tpy; the company also operates two
cement grinding units with a total capacity of 300,000 tpy. Equipment to
be procured under the project includes quarry equipment, limestone crushing
plant, aerial ropeway, belt conveyor, limestone preblending system, a new
dry process raw mill, a kiln system with electrostatic precipitator for gas
cleaning, clinker storage silo, cement silo and rotary packing machine, a
coal mill for kiln precalciner and associated coal feeders and duist
collection equipment.
Raw Materials and Other Input Materials
4.12      Adequacy and suitability of raw materials were examined for all
six subprojects under Part A. For purchased input materials source and
location were specified and in all cases the reliability of supply was
confirmed as evidenced by long-time supply associations. Coal linkage,
which is critical for a greenfield plant, is not an issue for the projects,
since the plants already have coal linkage. The CCI Mandhar plant will
require a 15% increase in coal supply but all other conversion projects
will result in reduced coal consumption.
Infrastructure
4.13      Power requirements will increase for all the plants, mainly
because of the increased production but also because of the higher specific
power consumption of the dry process (approximately 10% higher than wet
process). Upon obtaining the industrial license, the plants are
automatically assured of receiving the incremental power required. All
have been required to install transformers dnd substations to receive power
at 132,000 volts, which has become the standard, and the indicated capital
costs provide for this requirement. Nearly all of the projects include
installation of captive power generation, where needed, to permit continued
operation of the kiln system during power cuts which are still common in
many states. Water supply is not a problem for any of the plants,
particularly because the water requirements are reduced with the
application of dry process operation.

Environmental Impact and Pollution Control
4.14      The major source of pollution in a cement plant is dust emission
originating with kiln and mill exhaust and conveyor transfer points. India
has recently introduced standards for source emission of solids, equivalent
to 250 mg/NM3. These standards are deemed satisfactory. All projects
comprise pollution control equipment for rawmill and kiln exhaust which
will comply with the new Indian standards. Three project sponsors (i.e.,
Birla Jute, CCI and ICL) have provided for well-designed dust collection
equipment for the clinker cooler exhaust to comply with the emission
standards. KCP is reviewing technical options and will finalize its design
choice within the next 2-3 months. After technical discussions with ACC,
it has been agreed that appropriate dust collection equipment would be
installed as part of a corporate-wide program that will be carried out
independently of the project. Agreement was obtained that all subprojects
will meet Indian environmental standards.
Part B
4.15      This component provides a line of credit of US$35 million
covering the estimated foreign exchange financing requirements for
smaller-scale modernization, rehabilitation, energy conservation,
environmental control and balancing schemes that are expected to be carried
out over the next 2-3 years at other existing plants, and for developing
improved marketing and distribution systems. It would assist companies
which are not included in Part A to acquire advanced technology and modern
operations know-how and to improve productivity, fuel efficiency and
environmental control features in their plants. Typically, a subproject
under Part B would include the acquisition of software for process control,
the installation of modern instrumentation and control systems,
energy-saving devices, dust collection equipment and debottlenecking
equipment (balancing of process units which, due to insufficient capacity,
prevent the rest of the plant from attaining rated capacity). The
component would also finance technical assistance to improve operations and
management. ICICI has already obtained expressions of interest from
several companies. Of the total estimated financing of US$250-300 million
needed by the industry for these smaller scale modernization programs, only
about 30% could be met from internal sources (para 2.15); the remainder,
i.e. US$175-200 million, would need debt financing; the proposed line of
credit would thus provide about 20% of this eAternal requirement covering
foreign exchange needs, for commitment over 2-3 years. Subprojects will be
identified and appraised by ICICI. The average size of loan financing from
the line of credit would be about US$5-8 million equivalent, and the
average project size would be about US$10-15 million equivalent.
Appraisals for subprojects, whose total funding requirements from the
proposed line of credit exceed US$6 million equivalent, would be subject to
prior Bank review and approval.
Part C
4.16      This comprises two sub-components and provides financing for
technical assistance and training. The Indian cement industry is expanding



- 26 -
rapidly with many new companies entering the industry, and an acute
shortage of skilled plant operators has developed. This expansion has
coincided with a revolution in technology (dry process precalciner kilns)
which has compounded this problem. The scope and content of the two
sub-components are as follows: (see Annex 4-8).
(a) Part Cl: Improvement, upgrading of ACC and CCI owned and
operated training facilities and project/company-related
technical assistance and training for the five companies under
Part A. The upgrading of ACC and CCI facilities would include
purchase of modern training equipment and related software,
construction of new dormitory facilities, and use of experts from
well-established firms of international repute to design training
programs, train trainers and generally upgrade the overall
quality of ACC and CCI training efforts. About 6 man-years of
expert assistance would be provided for these two companies. In
addition, this component would cover training needs of plant
operators at each of the conversion sites, as well as project
management assistance (including review of technical
specifications prior to bidding, assistance in bid evaluation,
supervision of detailed engineering design, and overall project
management) from external consultants where specialized expertise
is required. Consultant selection is under way. About 100
man-months of total consultant assistance would be needed for
this purpose. Funding for the above needs is included in the
loan allocation for Part A of the Project (see paras 5.05 and
5.10).
(b) Part C2: At the subsector level, under the sponsorship of the
Cement Manufacturers' Association (CMA) (see Annex 4-1),
consultants would assist in preparing development strategy for
the cement industry covering manpower needs, training
requirements, and the strategy plan for medium- and long-term
manpower development. Using the results of a manpower survey,
the consultants would propose the actions needed at individual
company- and industry-wide levels to upgrade existing skills to
respond to changing technology requirements, to train new
personnel at pre-entry and post-entry stages, and to develop
suitable curricula and upgrade training facilities in existing
academic institutions and in possible new training center(s) to
be established by the industry.  The consultants yould also
evaluate the feasibility of developing jointly owned and operated
training centers for the industry as a whole. The strategy study
would be completed by December 31, 1986. Terms of Reference have
been agreed; consultant selection is under way. Assistance would
also be provided to the existing regional technical training
institutes in India for the development of curricula related to
fields where the industry's most pressing needs would be felt in
the near and medium terms. These areas include training of
maintenance personnel, plant operators, first-level supervisors,
and would focus particularly on instrumentation and process
control, electronics, and mechanical, electrical machinery. Some



- 27 -
provision for purchase of training equipment and teaching aids
would be made. A total of 50 man-months of expert assistance
would be required. Funding for Part CZ of the Project would be
provided under the allocation for Part C, shown in para 5.10.
Detailed equipment lists and Terms of Reference for technical assistance
experts have been prepared by ACC and CCI for their particular needs and
reviewed by the Bank (Annex 4-8). Terms of Reference for the proposed
manpower study are also shown in Annex 4-8, which also shows the agreed
timetable for implementation of the technical assistance and training
component of the Project.
C. Project Management and Implementation
4.17      All but one of the project sponsors have retained qualified
Indian consultants to assist in formulating project concepts and to perform
the feasibility study.9/ All project sponsors have retained consultants
to prepare bid specifications, assist in bid evaluation, prepare
construction drawings, and provide construction management and assistance
during commissioning. All consultants and most of the cement companies
have recent experience in cement plant design and erection. The individual
project management organizations and implementation schedule are described
in connection with project descriptions in Annexes 4.2-4.7. Table 4.2
summarizes the implementation schedule for the subprojects. The schedule
for the seventh subproject (SDC - Sikka plant) will be reviewed when
appraisal is completed in 1986.

The most critical element in the implementation schedule is delivery time
for major equii ment. Most equipment of Indian make requires 18 months from
date of order, wh'le overseas equipment may only require 12 months from

- 28 -
date of downpayment. The 24-30 months estimated by the project sponsors as
time required from signing of the major equipment contact to completion of
construction will require careful planning. However, since the
construction takes place at existing plant sites with staff and
infrastructure in place, and with staff experienced in construction from
ongoing rehabilitation programs, there should be no problems in achieving
the indicated schedules. Allowing for any slippages, the subprojects would
all be completed by June 30, 1990. The Sikka plant is also expected to be
comleted by the above date; the company has completed a first phase
conversion project and is well experienced in the details of implementing
such a project. Detailed schedules will be reviewed during 1986 when
appraisal would be completed by ICICI/IDBI and the Bank.
D. Training and Manpower Development
4.18      For all subprojects, the conversion has provided opportunity to
increase labor productivity as several old inefficient production units are
replaced by one unit of higher capacity. Some of the companies plan to
negotiate severance arrangements or early retirement of the redundant
personnel, while others will wait for normal attrition to reduce the
staff (Annexes 4-2-4-7). All of the companies have increased their staff
of engineers and skilled personnel to secure a smooth project
implementation and start-up. The personnel selected to operate the new
machinery will be trained in India either in modern plants belonging to the
same company or in competitor plants. A few of the project sponsors will
send selected personnel to receive training abroad. All sponsors will
avail themselves of services provided by the equipment suppliers both
during equipment installation and during commissioning. The most
critically needed training is in maintenance and operation of instrument
and computer control systems. The project provides financing for
establishment of a training function in these and other related operational
areas (see para 4.16).
V. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Capital Cost
5.01      The total capital cost for Parts A and C of the project is
estimated at Rs 4,359 million (US$335 million equivalent). The total
foreign exchange component is estimated at US$159 million equivalent (i.e.,
47% of the total. Interest during construction is estimated at
Rs 594 million (US$46 million equivalent) of which US$16 million equivalent
(34%) in foreign exchange. Total financing requirements for Parts A and C
amount to Re 4,953 million (US$381 million equivalent). Part B of the
project is estimated to cost Rs 1,155 million (US$89 million equivalent).
Incremental working capital needs at start-up of the new kilns are marginal
and are not shown in the cost table. As all companies are going concerns,
all incremental working capital needs at start-up and in subsequent stages
of production would be met easily from established credit lines with
commercial banks.

5.02      The base capital cost estimates were prepared by the companies
and their consultants from ac_ual recent quotations under Indian conditions
for the principal packages for equipment and services and/or their
experience with projects presently under execution. (Summaries of capital
cost estimates by plant are shown as Annexes 5-1 through 5-6, and Project
File Items 5-1 through 5-6 show details of the cost by major and minor bid
packages.) The cost for outside assistance (including consulting fees,
travel and subsistence expenses) has been estimated on the basis of an
average rate of US$12,000 per man-month, with an estimated 250 man-months
required (para 4.16). The base cost estimates compare very favorably with
other projects outside India, since they include a substantial element of
local manufacture.10/ Despite a high degree of confidence in the base
cost estimate, physical contingencies have been set at 10% of base costs
for civil works and certain categories of equipment purchases to allow for
certain possible design modifications in several plant departments.
However, for most equipment and machinery, only a 5% contingency has been
applied as this would be sufficient given the status of engineering and
design in most cases. Decisions on final equipment choice and layout will
be taken during technical evaluation of bids prior to contract signature.
The estimates include provision for price escalation using factors in
accordance with IBRD guidelines applied to the base cost estimate plus
physical contingencies and take into account the expected project
implementation schedule of individual subprojects under Part A with project
completion projected for 1989/90. The price escalation amounts to only an
average of 14.8% on the base cost plus physical contingencies and reflects
the mix of project implementation schedules.
5.03      The incremental working capital at start-up of the kilns under
the conversion subprojects is low and is well within the capacity of the
companies to finance out of existing sources and ongoing operations. The
main elements to be financed would include annual stocks of spare parts and
consumable items, as well as increasing receivables arising from the
expected increase in sales volumes. As the subprojects also include a
basic stock of spares at the outset, no separate additional pr-vision for
incremental working capital at start-up has been made in the cost table.
Interest during construction of US$45.7 million is derived using the
expected subproject implementation schedules under Part A and the assumed
terms for debt to be raised for the project as detailed in the financing
plan (para 5.04).  The estimates of total financing required z e
reasonable.
B. Financing Plans
5.04      The total financing requirements for the project are proposed to
be met as follows:
10/  A typical 1.0 million TPY plant without social infrastructure, built
in Western Europe or the USA, would cost at least US$170-200 per
capacity-ton (total installed cost in current terms), as compared to
US$120 per ton for recent greenfield plants under Indian conditions
including social infrastructure (see also para 2.11).

The subprojects under Part A of the oroject involve financing plans ranging
from 50% debt and 50% internal cash generation to a maximum of 80% debt and
20% internal cash generation (including new equity and/or subordinated debt
issues). The debt financing would be provided in approximately a 62/38
ratio between the proposed Bank loan and the two financial institutions out
of their convertible rupee funds and through convertible and
non-convertible debenture issues to be floated by some companies. The Bank
portion of the financing for the main project components is based on the
total estimated cost (excluding duties and taxes) of those bid packages
that are expected to be awarded following ICB procurement in accordance
with Bank guidelines, and to the financing of the technical assistance
programs identified with each sponsor, including the upgrading of ACC and
CCI training facilities as described in para 4.15 (Part Cl of the
project). The detailed financing plans for each subproject already
appraised under Part A are shown in Aanezes 5-1 to 5-6. All subloan



- 33 -
covenants with the six main sponsors will include provision for cost
overrun financing to be provided on terms and conditions deemed
satisfactory by the Bank.
C. Onlending Arrangements
5.06      The Bank loan for Parts A and C would be made to the Republic of
India on standard World Bank terms. GOI would onlend the funds in the
following manner:
(a) Parts A and Cl. The funds would be onlent in equal proportions
to ICICI and IDBI (in their roles as lead financial institutions
to the six companies). The onlent amounts would be in rupee
terms. GOI would retain the foreign exchange risk.
-    from GOI to the institutions:  standard interest rate
applicable to Rupee lending from GOI to financial
institutions, currentl; set at 10.25% per annum
-    from institutions to subborrowers:  prevailing rates for
Rupee loans (currently 14%)
The repayment of the amounts onlent by GOI to the institutions
would be on the basis of fixed amortization schedule over 20
tears including 5 years' grace, i.e., on the same terms as the
Bank loan to GOI. Terms to subborrowers would be a maximum of 13
years, including up to 4.5 years' grace.
(b) Part C2. The funds under Part C2 would be provided as a
non-reimbursable grant by GGI to ICICI who would administer the
funds for the account of the CMA and the regional technical
training institutes to carrr .ut Part C2 of the Project.
5.07      The Bank loan for Part B would be made to ICICI on standard terms
with guarantee of the Republic of India. ICICI will repay the loan on a
fixed amortization schedule of 20 years, including a grace period of 5
years, consistent with recent Bank practice. As ICICI is now allowed to
have an overseas account, it would protecc itself against the foreign
exchange risks by relending funds in the same currency. Onlending terms to
subborrowers would follow recent Bank practice on its lines of credit to
ICICI, with repayments spread over 7-10 years, including up to 2 years'
grace period. Exchange risk would be borne by subborrowers.
5.08      Effectiveness of the Bank loan to India would be subject to:
(a) the signature of subsidiary loan agreements between GOI, on the
one hand, and ICICI and IDBI, on the other hand, on terms and
conditions deemed satisfactory by the Bank;
(b) the signature of a Grant Agreement between GOI and ICICI for use
of funds allocated under Part C2, on terms and conditions deemed
satisfactory by the Bank.



- 34 -
No special condition of effectiveness would attach to the Bank loan to
ICICI. Disbursement of funds under Parts A and Cl for each subproject
would be subject to signature of subloan agreements between ICICI, IDEI and
each project sponsor, on terms and conditions deemed satisfactory by the
Bank.
D. Procurement
5.09      International competitive bidding (ICB) under Bank guidelines
will be used for all Bank-financed goods under Part A of the project;
prequalification would be used for major equipment packages. A preference
margin of 15%, or the applicable rate of customs duties if lower, would be
provided to domestic equipment suppliers in evaluation of bids received
under ICB. Under Part A, the Bank has already identifie1 and agreed with
each project sponsor (for the six subprojects already a:.praised) the
bidding packages for ICB procurement and the prequalification procedures
have been completed by most of the sponsors.ly Most major packages would
include supervision of erection/installation to ensure satisfactory
performance guarantees, and may include in some cases a limited -turnkey-
bid including erection/installation and engineering. Civil works would not
be included in any of the proposed equipment supply/erection packages. A
total of 54 packages at a base cost of US$106 million equivalent have been
defined with the 5 sponsors for the 6 appraised subprojects; of these, 4
packages for a combined base cost of US$43.4 million (or 41% of all ICB
packages) exceed US$5 million equivalent in base costs, and another 14
packages for a combined base cost of US$31.2 million equivalent (or 29% of
the total) exceed US$1.5 million equivalent. Prior Barnk review of bid
awards would be required for all contract packages exceeding the equivalent
of US$1.5 million. This would ensure that i8 packages valued at a total
US$75 million in base costs and representing 70% by value of all contracts
expected to be awarded following ICB would be subject to prior Bank
review. The remaining packages average US$1 million equivalent base cost
and may be bid singly or grouped at the bidder's preference. The packages
are sufficiently attractive to stimulate interest among foreign bidders.
The bie packages for the seventh subproject are expected to follow a
similar pattern. Consultant services would be procured following IBRD
guidelines. For Part B, ICICI's standard bidding procurement procedures,
which are based on the evaluation of at least three quotations, and used in
other line of credit ope ,tions with ICICI will be followed; only the
direct foreign exchange content of equipment purchases will be financed by
the Bank loan. In accordance with DFC practice, eligible expenditures
incurred up to 90 days prior to the Bank's receipt of a subloan application
would be eligible for financing. Procurement arrangements are summa.ized
in the table below. Details of the bid packages by subproject and
estimated costs are in the Project Files Items 5-1 to 5-6.
11/  A minor amount of equipment procurement under Part A would be on the
basis of international shopping to ensure compatibility with existing
facilities. The total amount of such procurement would be less than
US$3.0 million equivalent, mainly comprising diesel generating sets at
the ACC plants, and other miscellaneous items.

detailed in Annex 6-3 and summarized below:

5.11      It is expected that, of those items to be financed by the Bank,
about US$102.0 million (about 62% of the Bank loan to India) will be for
contracts awarded to local suppliers following ICB. In order to simplify
disbursement procedures and lower the administrative burden, letters of
credit under Part A of the project would be established by ICICI for
contacts valued at less than US$1.0 million equivalent witnout seeking the
Bank's special commitment guarantee. Under the Bank loan to ICICI for
Part B of the project, the same would apply for contracts valued at less
than US$250,000. As ICICI has well established banking channels, this
procedure would allow for speedier disbursements by eliminating prior
review on about 70% of the expected contracts valued at about 30% of the
total amount expected to be financed by the Bank loans (see also
para 5.09).
5.12      The expected disbursement schedule of the proposed Bank loan is
shown as Annex 5-7. It takes into account the advanced stage of
procurement at several of the proposed conversion subprojects and uses the
profile for private sector industrial and technical assistance projects in
India and the South Asia Region. As all project sponsors are well
organized for project management, the use of the standard profile results
in a conservative forecast compared to what was achieved under the recently
completed Tamil Nadu Newsprint Project (Loan 2050-IN), which was a
greenfield site and involved more complex contracting arrangements. As for
the loan to ICICI for Part B of the project, potential subprojects have
been identified and commitments are expected to be made over the next 24-36
months. The subprojects would all have shorter implementation periods than
the major conversion subporjects, and disbursements would be completed
substantially by March 31, 1990 (i.e., at the end of the Seventh Plan



- 37 -
Period) and fully by December 31, 1991. No retroative financing is
proposed for this part of the Project. The bulk of the loan disbursements
are on the loan to India, expected to take place during the first three
years following loan signatures, and this loan is expected to be
substantially disbursed for the major conversion projects by December 31,
1990, and fully disbursed for all components by December 31, 1991.
5.13      ACC and India Cements have signed or are expected to sign
technical assistance contracts with overseas consultants for assistance in
project management, technical bid preparation and review. A small amount
of the loan to India would be disbursed against expenditures incurred after
July 1, 1985, but not earlier than nine months prior to actual loan
signature. A maximum of US$1.5 million may be expected to be disbursed in
this manner.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions Used and Forecast of Production Costs
6.01      Details of the assumptions used in the financial projections for
the six subprojects already appraised are provided in Annex 6-1. Appraisal
of the seventh subproject would follow the same methodology and is expected
to yield similar results. The projections are made through to the steady
state in current terms when all the subprojects reach full capacity (90%
capacity utilization) and held constant thereafter. The actual and
projected unit cost of cement produced at each of the subproject plants is
shown as Annex 6-2. In each of the six subprojects, the conversion from
wet to dry process technology results in savings in coal consumption as
detailed under Annexes 4-2 to 4-7 and that translates into financial
savings as follows:
Table 6.1
Coal Cost Savings
Coal Cost/Ton of OPC
Cement (1985 Rs)          Difference
Wet          Dy              (X)
ACC Madukkarai                            239.9         153.3          -36.1
ACC Shahabad                              194.2          98.2          -49.4
Birla Jute Satna Works                    115.3          71.2          -38.2
CCI Mandhar (Slag Cement)                  50.1          28.2          -43.7
ICL Sankarnagar (incl. Lignite)           222.0         131.6         -40.7
KCP Macherla                              157.5          99.0          -37.1
The magnitude of the savings is expected to increase as coal prices are
expected to rise about 2.5% a year in real terms. These savings translate
into the main benefits of the conversion programs.
6.02      The production build-up assumes a realistic kiln capacity
utilization of 70%, 80% and 90% in the three years after start-up (as



- 38 -
explained in para 3.05, l00X capacity utilization is defined at 90.4% usage
by international norms). Sales revenues are projected using prices for
levy and non-levy cement existing in 1985 through 1989/90. Full decontrol
of cement is assumed from 1990/91, and a price of Rs 600 is used for the
projections from that year onward, except in the case of the plants in
Tamil Nadu and Karnataka which are located closer to major deficit areas
(para 3.11). This is illustrated in the table below; the average price
under decontrol is not substantially higher than the actual average net
realization prices being obtained by the cement plants under existing
controls.

Birla Satna                    472          494                    575
CCI Mandhar                     477         499                    600

KCP                             474         500                    600
Note: Difference between wet and dry prices under existing controls is due
to GOI rules under which levy quota on incremental production would
be calculated on basis of new plants, thereby reducing the
levy/non-levy ratio of 60/40 for the old plants to an average 50/50
(see Annex 6-1).
6.03      Operating cost estimates are based on a detailed evaluation of
labor, raw material, coal, power of individual plants in the consolidated
financial projections of multi-plant companies (i.e. ACC, Birla Jute and
ICL) and overhead costs at existing operations as well as at each of the
companies' plants (including those of the Project), which are planned to
come into operation over the forecast period. In the case of KCP and Birla
Jute, the consolidations include company projections of sales, costs, and
profitability at other non-cement operations. Coal prices are assumed to
increase 2.5Z in real terms, in line with the expected realignment of coal
prices as part of the organized coal sector development programs. Other
operating zosts are assumed to remain constant in real terms. As seen in
Annex 6-2, all the wet process plants in the private sector and the public
sector are comparable, with the exception of ACC's Madukkarai and ICL's
Sankarnagar plants, which have substantially higher costs of limestone
quarrying and much higher coal prices due to their distance from the main
coalfield belt (see Map 19204). These two plants therefore are running
losses under current realization prices. The substantial improvement in
coal efficiency will enable these and the other plants to achieve
profitable operations.

B. Financial Projections
6.04      A brief summary of the main companies' past performance and
current financial position for the last five years is provided below and a
more complete description iz in the Project File, Items 6-1 to 6-5 and
summarized in Annexes 6-3 to 6-7. Forecast consolidated income statements,
balance sheets and funds flow statements for each company are provided in
Annexes 6-3 to 6-7 and summarized in tables under each section below. All
the companies analyzed had historically been strong financial performers,
have had sound capital structures and the pr..jects are expected to enhance
even further both their competitiveness and profitability. Except for CCI,
all the companies are actively traded in the stock market, and are
considered very attract:ive for both institutional and individual
investors. Even CCI has been able to raise funds in the financial markets
through public debenture issues, which have been oversubscribed.
6.05      It is very important to note that although the financial
projections have assumed that the production of the old wet process
facilities being replaced will stop when the new dry-process units come
onstream, five oi the six plants will be able to run both facilities
concurrently until production from the new units is stabilized. In
financial terms this means that production losses resulting during the
start-up period will be minimal and that in all likelihood, sales revenues
will be higher than forecast.
ACC (details Annex 6-3)
6.06      ACC.  The company is the leader in the cement industry accounting
for about 25% of the domestic cement production. Owing mostly to levels of
capacity utilization well above the industry's average and good overall
operating efficiency, ACC has had profitable years prior to the partial
decontrol of the cement prices. In addition ACC has avoided significant
production losses through the installation of captive power plants which
can now meet about 60% of its power requirements. With the impact of
decontrol, average return on net worth has improved to 18.5% compared to
13.5% for the period 1977/78-1981/82. At the end of the current fiscal
year, ACC's financial position remained sound with a current ratio of 1.3,
a debt/equity ratio of 64/36 and a debt/service coverage of 2.2 times.
Dividend payout ratio for the last five years has averaged 17.2%.
6.07      The company's cement production is expected to increase by 31%
from 7.3 million tons in 1984/85 to 9.6 million tons in 1991/92, when,
apart from other ongoing projects, both Madukkarai and Shahabad are
expected to reach steady state. At this production level, ACC will
continue to remain the largest cement manufacturer in India. As a result
of the benefits derived from other ongoing projects and the Bank project,
namely: {i) improved power and fuel efficiency with dry and semi-dry
process as opposed to wet process technology; and (ii) lower labor costs
per ton due to economies of scale from larger sized plants, operating
profits will more than double from 14.1% to 28.9% by 1991/92. Similarly,
over the same period, cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will
decrease by 14% from 91% to 78%.

Debt Service Coverage Ratio     1.4   1.9   1.8   1.9   2.4    1.4    4.0
6.08      The table above shows that the Company's total sales are expected
to grow about 132 p.a. over the next seven years. During the period
1989/90 onwards when production from the new units takes place, sales
revenues rise rapidly and the Company's profitability improves acrordingly
although by 1991/92, after-tax profits decline slightly as the tax burden
becomes heavier with the expiration of tax incentives. The ability of the
Company to service its obligations to existing and proposed project lenders
appears adequate. As a result of demands placed on its cash generation
during 1986/87-1988/89 to support not only the Project, but also other
substantial capital expenditures, ACC will resort to short-term borrowings
during the project implementation period to cover its working capital
needs. This will result in a mild deterioration of the current ratio from
1.4 in 1986/87 to 1.3 from 1987/88 through 1989/90. The large rise in debt
service in 1990/91 is a result of the redemption of non-convertible
debentures being used to fund ACC's ongoing capital expenditure program.
Liquidity improves rapidly thereafter in line with increased sales
revenues. The debt/equity ratio appears adequate at all times. A
sensitivity test has been carried out assuming substantially lower net
realization prices for the company as a whole, either due to delays in GOI
decontrol policy or due to temporary oversupply in the market leading to a
drop in free-market prices. Even if the total value of ACC's sales were to
drop by 20% as a result, ACC's financial position remains satisfactory.
Debt service coverage remains at around 1.5, and although profitability is
substantially lower, it is still satisfactory at about 5% after tax. To
ensure the maintenance of a sound financial position, no additional
covenants, except those stated in para 6.23, will be required to be
included in the ACC subloan agreements.
Birla Jute (details Annex 6-4)
6.09      Birla Jute.  The diversified operations of Birla Jute, which
include jute, cement, carbide and synthetics, have helped the company
maintain a fairly steady performance for the last two decades despite the
l



- 41 -
poor performance of its jute division which accounts for 15% of total
sales. The cement division, which started commercial operations in 1959,
and at present accounts for 66% of total sales, has consistently helped
Birla Jute maintain steady earnings growth. After the commissioning of the
Vikas plant adjacent to its Satna plant in November 1984, Birla Jute's
cement capacity increased to 2.4 million tons, thereby lifting the state of
Madhya Pradesh to top position among cement-producing states (para 2.10).
The cement division has also had to contend with numerous infrastructural
problems but has sought to minimize the impact of power shortages through
the installation of captive units which now account for more than half of
its requirements. Following the initial effect of partial decontrol in
1981/82, return of net worth has declined from 19.8% to 4.9% in 1983/84,
mainly as a result of higher depreciation charges, but the company reduced
the level of dividend payments substantially in order to finance the
additional fixed assets with minimal borrowing. The Company, however,
remains highly attractive to investors and its first ever public issue of
convertible debentures in 1984 was oversubscribed six times. At the end of
the current fiscal year, the company's debt/equity ratio stood at 28/72,
current ratio at 1.8 and debt service coverage at 1.7 times.
6.10      The Company's cement production is expected to increase from
1.9 million tons in 1984/85 to 2.7 million tons in 1990/91, a 42% increase,
when both the Chittorgarh and the Satna plant would have achieved expected
steady state. The increase in cement production and the benefits derived
from converting from wet process to the more fuel-efficient dry process
technology are expected to reduce cost of goods sold as a percentage of
sales by 15% from 72% in 1984/85 to 61% in 1991/92.

6.11      As indicated in the table above, the Company is expected to
maintain a strong financial position throughout the implementation of the
Project and thereafter on account of its solid capital structure.



- 42 -
Throughout the period 1986/87-1991/92 the debt service coverage is 3 or
higher, even when the Project's maturities become due in 1989/90. Also in
this period, net profit as a percentage of sales ranges between 13_17Z and
debt/equity ratio is not higher than 32/68. Birla Jute's overall cement
manufacturing facilities will be relatively new after the conversion of the
Satna plant; after decontrol, its average retention price will only
increase about 20X compared to ACC, which has a higher proportion of older
plants. Birla Jute's operations are substantially more robust as a
result.  A sensitivity test indicates that the Company could sustain a
total sales drop of over 30% through a combination of stagnant prices and
low volumes before any of the critical financial ratios (debt service
coverage, current ratio, profit after tax) would be impaired. No
additional covenants, other than those mentioned in para 6.23, will be
sought in the Birla Jute subloan agreement.
CCI (details Annex 6-5)
6.12      CCI.  Despite low profitability or losses during the late 1970s,
mostly associated with inadequate retention prices, high depreciation and
interest charges of new units and infrastructural problems, the Company's
financial situation remained sound, reflecting the conservative financing
of CCI's past projects which, according to Government practice, were
financed 50% debt and 50X equity with equity funds being provided first.
In the period 1981/82-1982/83 profits soared to an average of 50% of sales,
not only as a result of decontrol, but also to high levels of capacity
utilization (83%) and that the company marketed 7.2 million tons of
imported cement. Although profits have fallen due to increased input costs
and higher depreciation charges, at the end of 1984/85 debt/equity ratio
stood at 45/55, current ratio at 1.3 and debt service coverage at 1.2
times.
6.13      CCI's cement production is expected to increase almost threefold
during the next six years, when all its ongoing projects including the
Mandhar project would have achieved steady state. As a result, total
production will grow from 1.9 million tons in 1985/86 to 5.1 million tons
in 1990/91 thus becoming the second largest cement producer in india after
ACC. Due to the resulting benefits that will accrue from improved
economies of scale (i.e., by 1990/91 CCI will operate four plants with
capacities between 750,000-1,000,000 tons per year) and reduction in
operating costs attributed to the ongoing modernization conversion projects
costs of goods sold as a percentage of sales will decline from 88% in
1984/85 to 67% in 1990/91.

6.14      As shown in the above table, CCI's total sales are projected to
grow at about 24% p.a.  Profit after tax as a percentage of sales will turn
around from a loss in 1985/86-1986/87 as a result of heavier depreciation
and interest charges of the new projects of Tandur and Neemuch to 10.6% in
1988/89 when all the projects are at a steady state, although it will
decrease thereafter as a result of higher income tax payments. In all
probability, however, profits will be higher since further investments will
be made to shield taxable income. The ability of the Company to service
debt of the ongoing and future projects is tight in 1985/86, when the major
expansion projects now under way are not yet been commissioned and the
Company's cash generation is low; however, starting in 1986/87, cash
generation improves rapidly and debt service coverage remains adequate
throughout the remainder of the period. CCI's long-term debt/equity ratio
which has been satisfactory in the past, reflecting the Government's
conservative financing practice (50% debt; 50Z equity) for new projects,
will remain so mainly due to the increase in cash generation after
decontrol. A sensitivity test has been carried out on CCI's ability to
weather any adverse stagnation of cement prices. As in the other cases,
CCI's net sales value could fall by at least 25% (implying stagnant prices
and a 10% drop in production), before its ability to service existing and
projected debt would be impaired. The Corporation has not projected any
additional long-term borrowings.  No additional covenants other than those
mentioned in para 6.23 will be sought in the CCI subloan agreements.
ICL (details Annex 6-6)
6 15       ICL.  Owing to increased capacity utilization resulting from the
availability of additional captive power, improved performance of the
Company's quarrying operations and the impact of partial decontrol, ICL's
financial situation has improved gradually since 1981/82. For example the
debt/equity ratio improved from 71/29 at the end of 1981/82 to 38/62 at the
end of 1984/85. Debt service ranged between 1.7 and 3.8 times during the
same period while its current ratio (excluding customer advances from



- 44 -
current liabilities) is a satisfactory 1.8. On account of losses carried
forward and investment allowance resulting from recent capital investments
in quarry modernization, ICL has effectively shielded a large part of
profits from taxation. During the period 1979/80-1981/82 the company did
not pay dividends, but resumed dividends in 1982/83; over the last three
years, dividend payout ratio has averaged 16.2%.
6.16      By expanding the Sankarnagar plant capacity to 3,000 TPD, India
Cements expects to double its sales revenue from Ras 958 million at present
to Rs 1,885 million in 1992 when the Project reaches its steady state. In
the meantime, a comprehensive renovation and maintenance program is being
carried out to keep both Sankarnagar and Sankari plants operating at a high
level of capacity utilization until the Project is completed. While the
total financing requirements of both investments (about Rs 1.036 million)
will strain the Company's financial position, ICL's profitability may be
affected only during 1988/89-1989/90 due to the more than doubling of
depreciation and interest charges. ICL has, however, put together a
financing plan which includes the following innovative features: (i) a
convertible debenture issue in 1986/87 of Rs 98 million on a rights basis
of which 25% will be converted at a Rs 5 per share premium; (ii) a rights
issue of Rs 36 million in 1987/88; and (iii) an equity linked
non-convertible debenture issue of Rs 98 million in 1987/88. These
features which would raise nearly 25% of the funding needs for the major
conversion project and would serve to reduce the debt service burden due to
the conversion features (which essentially capitalizes interest during the
project implementation period and issues equity shares in lieu of the
capitalized interest payment at project completion).

6.17      As shown above, heavy demands will be placed on the Company's
cash generation during the wind-up of project implementation when both
payments of interest and principal on long-term debt reach about 78% of
cash generation. In this year also, debt service coverage is at the lowest
point of the forecast period but recovers quickly in the following years as



- 45 -
the Project increases capacity utilization and the initial impact of price
decontrol is felt. In 1990/91, ICL would also convert a part of the
debenture issues being used to fuik d its conversion project. This results
in a lower debt service burden and consequent improvement of ICL's
liquidity position. Similarly, as retained profits increase quickly
(partly as a result of tax shields), ICL's debt/equity position also
improves rapidly to a comfortable 58/42 in 1990/91. ICL's average
retention price is expected to increase only about 17%, after decontrol, as
the Company presently realizes a substantial premium on free market sales
due to its advantageous location in a deficit-ridden area. A sensitivity
test has been carried out on ICL's ability to withstand a stagnant cement
price situation and a lower sales volume. The results indicate that ICL's
sales would need to fall over 25% before the Company's ability to service
its total debt obligations and maintain satisfactory liquidity is
impaired. ICL's liquidity will remain sound throughout the period, never
falling below 1.5.
KCP (details Annex 6-7)
6.18      KCP.  The Company's activities include cement, sugar, engineering
and distillery operations. Cement sales turnover accounts for about one
third of total revenues. Unlike southern cement plants, KCP's unit has not
been hampered by power shortages. Furthermore, management's close
attention to the operations of the cement plant, and various modernization
programs implemented during the last ten years, have produced levels of
capacity utilization which are among the highest in the industry. For the
last ten years KCP has sustained profitable operations, the company is
conservatively managed and has relied mostly on internal funds and
long-term debt to finance capital investments. The current ratio has
improved from 0.8 in 1980/81 to 1.8 in 1984/85 and it would be much higher
if advances from customers, which represent a claim on future production
rather than a cash liability are excluded. At year end 1984/85 the
Company's debt/equity ratio stood at 38/62 and its debt service coverage at
1.6 times.
6.19      KCP's total sales revenue is projected to increase by 40% from
Rs 796 million in 1985/86 to Rs 1,122 million in 1990/91 as a result of
more than doubling its cement sales revenue, and a 73% increase in sugar
sales revenue due to the expansion of the Company's sugar cane crushing
facilities. Sales of the engineering unit are forecast to decrease by
about one fourth to reflect conservatively the competitive situation of the
equipment manufacturing industry.

6.20      Although the Company will experience losses in 1987/88 and low
profitability in 1988/89-1989/90 due to lower capacity utilization during
start-up of the new dry-process facilities and higher depreciation and
interest charge also associated with the new equipment, KCP's financial
position will remain good with adequate cash generation to service debt.
In fact the lowest level of projected debt service coverage of 1.2 occurs
only in 1988/89-1989/90 and quickly improves to 3.1 in the following fiscal
year. On the whole, the Company's projected financial position is sound
and its forecast revenues dependable based on its past ability to sustain
production at highest level of capacity utilization. Liquidity throughout
the period is adequate at all times with current ratio never falling below
1.6 and the low debt/equity position at all times will support the planning
of future capital investment. KCP's cement operations are sufficiently
robust to withstand continued price stagnantion and lower sales volumes.
As the Company's financial position is strong, a sensitivity test shows
that cement sales could drop by over 20% before KCP's ability to service
its existing and future debt burden or to maintain satisfactory liquidity
would be impaired.
C. Financial Rate of Return
6.21      The financial rates of return for the six plants are summarized
in Table 6.8 below and the details are given in Annex 6-8. A sensitivity
test on key assumptions as regards decontrol prices, capital cost increases
and project implementation has been performed and results are indicated in
the table below. The tests indicate that all conversion subprojects are
robust even at the extreme assumption that average realization prices would
remain stagnant under decontrol. The switching value indicated in the
table is the percentage of sales value (i.e., price times volume) at which
the TRR falls below 12%.

D. Financial Covenants, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
6.22      Audit of public sector accounts is performed at three distinct
levels: continuous audit by the company's internal audit department;
year-end audits by the statutory auditors; and audits by the Auditor
General's office as required of all public sector enterprises. The private
sector has to abide by the first two levels. The internal control and
accounting systems employed by all project entities are well maintained and
provide a satisfactory basis for management control and decision making.
The subloan agreements would provide for (i) audit reports by the company's
statutory auditors to be submitted within four months of the end of the
Company's fiscal year; and (ii) periodic project progress reports and
financial statements to be submitted on a timely basis. Reporting to the
Bank by ICICI/IDBI as the financial intermediaries would follow the above
schedules. After completion of the Project, each company will be requested
to prepare and furnish a comprehensive report on the Project, its
implementation, initial operation and the costs and benefits derived and
expected to be derived therefrom. Audits of ICICI's and IDBI's financial
performance will follow existing practice. The two institutions will
prepare Project Completion Reports along established lines.
6.23      To ensure the maintenance of a sound financial position, in
addition to the covenants relating to the financing of the Projects
(para 5.05), subloan agreements will provide for the following: (i) the
companies will maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.2 times and a
debt/equity ratio not greater than 67:33; and (ii) the companies will not
incur additional debt if to do so would cause the companies' debt/equity to
exceed 67:33 or its projected debt service coverage to fall below 1.5
times.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions Used
7. 01     Amounts for capital and operating costs used in the financial
projections have been adjusted in the economic analysis by excluding taxes
and duties contained therein. Power, which represents approximately 20% of
the financial operating costs for the Project, has been adjusted upwards to
reflect its economic costs. The economic cost of power is estimated to be
1.5 times the prevailing electricity tariff rates. In the case of coal,
economic costs are assumed to be equi alent to the financial costs. The
quality of coal received at the cement plants is of very poor quality, the
ash content varying from 30% to 40%, and thus assumed non-tradable. All
other costs are adjusted by using the standard Conversion Factor of 0.82
for India. The output of the Project is valued at the 1985 price of
imported cement, C&F Indian ports, of US$55 per ton. This is based on
current FOB prices Mediterranean ports and Korea of around US$27/ton for
bagged cement and about US$23/ton C&F charges to Indian ports, plus port
handling and insurance charges of Rs 119/ton. If cement could be imported'
in bulk carriers, the average costs/ton delivered Indian ports would be
US$37/ton to which local handling and packing charges would add another
Rs 195/ton, thus providing a total price for bagged cement at the border of
US$52/ton (at US$1 - Rs 13). The sensitivity test in Table 7.1 above
assumes a situation where international prices fall to a long-term low of
US$20/ton for bulk cement, and a minimal US$15/ton for transport to India,
plus local handling and packing charges of only US$13/ton (Rs 169/ton),
thus giving a long-term low international price of US$48/ton.
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.02      The economic rates of return for the subprojects already
appraised and the sensitivity tests are summarized below and detailed in
Annex 7. The switching value is calculated as the percentage of sales
value (i.e., price times volume) at which the economic rate of return falls
below 12%. A sensitivity test has also been carried out with other
combinations of adverse events, including a 25% increase in capital costs
and a drop in output prices to US$45/ton. In all cases, the economic rate
of return remains above 12%.

C. Other Benefits
7.03      Aside from the foregoing quantifiable benefits, the chief impact
of the Project will be to increase domestic supplies of cement - the
combined incremental output of the Project by 1992/93 is estimated at
1.3 million tons or 2.2% of projected domestic demand in that year. The
Project will thus contribute to the development of the Indian economy by
reducing future shortages of this basic commodity, the periodic
unavailability of which in the past has created severe bottlenecks and
disruptions to economic activity in user industries. The Project will also
create substantial additional employment among domestic equipment
manufacturers, which are expected to supply about 65% to 75% of the
equipment requirements for the Project, and in downstream industries,
particularly in the construction sector.
7.04      The Project will also play a role in institution building through
the provision of outside technical assistance to strengthen the various
sponsors' expertise in the implementation and operation of large-scale
projects. The technical assistance component, to be established under the
Project, will also contribute to the pool of in-house expertise and enhance
the companies' expertise.
D. Major Risks
7.05      The mission identified a number of risks which could affect the
projects, and evaluated their likely impact.
General Project Risks
7.06      Inefficient Implementation Capability and Project Delays.
Sufficient capabilities for project evaluation, design, management and
implementation have been developed in India. Practically all large
industrial concerns have developed their own design and engineering staff,
and some have entered equipment manufacturing as well. Some of the smaller



- 50 -
cement companies cooperate directly with the equipment manufacturers for
design and engineering. All of the project sponsors have assembled
competent staff, and most of the companies have recent experience in
project design and execution.  In addition, all sponsors have retained
competent and experienced consultant/engineers to assist in most or all
phases of project implementation. With regard to past complaints against
local manufacturers for delays in the supply of equipment, it should be
noted that many of the time-consuming procedures for import of materials
and components have been removed. Indian suppliers do not have heavy order
books at this time, and it appears that they can observe the 18-month
maximum delivery time, which is generally assumed to be the international |
norm. All foreign suppliers are underbooked and operate with minimum
delivery times. The considerable activity experienced within the
construction sector during the last three years has permited construction
contractors to mechanize and become efficient, and this subsector should
have ample capacity to permit compliance within the schedules.
Non-attainment of Rated Output Due to Various External Factors
7.07      Power Cuts.  This has been a serious problem during recent
years. During the years 1979/80 up to 1982/83 an average 10.6% of rated
production was lost I?-S we of power cuts, which to a large extent were
caused by a drought situation. In spite of heavy investments, power
generation will remain a problem in some of the states; however, the cement
industry has overcome this problem to a significant degree by installing
captive power-generating capacity. For example, all companies under the
project can generate between 20-65% of their power needs thus reducing
substantially the impact of power shortages. Although their use of captive
power is more expensive than normal electricity, it is economically
desirable if the alternative is to stop production.
7.08      Coal Supplies and Rail Transport Capacity.  The timely and
adequate supply of coal to the indian economy (the worlds fifth largest
consulmer in terms of tonnage of hard coal) will remain a major challenge
for many years to come. The most recent estimates 12/ indicate that
thermal coal supply and demand will be broadly in balance through 1989/90
(although large pithead stocks were built-up in 1983/84) and occasional
surpluses and shortages may arise in particular years depending on the
future performance of the economy. To this extent, the fuel savings
created by wet to dry conversions will reduce the coal tonnage and would
enable the companies to perform better within their present coal
allotments. On the other hand, rail transport capacity, which has suffered
from under-investment for the past decade, will be slow in meeting full
traffic demand. While the measures taken 13/ to improve the Indian
railroads are expected to result in future improvements in coal haulage,
some disruptions can be expected in the future. In the past, the impact of
these shortages on the cement industry has not always been fully

- 51 -
identified. GOI is now limiting the issuance of new licenses to projects
located in areas where rail capacity appears adequate. However, even if
these problems persisted through the life of the Project, it is unlikely
that capacity utilization would fall below 70-75%. Even at such levels
(which are below average historical capacity utilization of the companies
analyzed), the economic rate of return of the companies would remain
between 16% and 25%, underlying the desirability of the proposed
investment.
7.09      Financial Viability.  A final risk relates to the future
financial viability of the companies, should decontrol measures be
implemented more slowly than has been assumed in the financial projections
(Annex 6-1). This could lead to future shortages in the company's internal
cash generation. Since partial decontrol in early 1982 and the more recent
relaxation of the levy quotas (para 2.14), the resulting higher average
price has strengthened the financial position and profitability of the
companies. Furthermore, the level of debt required is considered well
within their borrowing capabilities on account of their strong
capitalization at the end of 1984/85. In any case, the future retention
price of Rs 600/ton which has been assumed after full decontrol is, on the
average, only about 18% higher than the average retention price which the
companies are now realizing under existing controls. As the bulk of the
incremental benefits in each subproject originates from improved fuel
consumption, overall gains in efficiency and incremental production, due
to the conversion process, the risk that decontrol may not be effected as
predicted, is minimal. Economic and financial rates of return show
relatively little change as the economic price assumed is close to the
average realization prices presumed to prevail after decontrol; as

INDIA - CEMENT IN USTRY PROJECT
GOI Policy for Promoting Growth and Development
of the Cement Subsector
1.        Over the past several years, the GOI has pursued a number of
measures including a deliberate policy of progressive decontrol of cement
prices and output, with a view to: (i) stimulating growth of capacity in
the Indian cement industry, particularly in light of shortages of cement
that were expected to continue for some time; (ii) to improving utilization
of existing capacity; (iii) to providing incentives at the producer level
for major programs of modernization, rehabilitation and energy
conservation; and (iv) ensuring that overall efficiency and productivity in
the industry were continually improved. Many of the policy initiatives in
this regard have also pervaded other subsectors of industry.
2.        As shown in the attached table, over the past 3-1/2 years since
the 1982 cement decontrol order, GOI's policies of progressive decontrol
and other measures have been effective and have resulted in: (a) a
substantial reduction in the percentage of cement subject to levy
arrange nets; (b) a substantial increase in levy prices; (c) a substantial
increase in the average retention price to producers (FOB plant); and
(d) increasing parity between the average of levy and non-levy prices and
the price of imported cement.
3.        With regard to planned Government actions, GOI policy objectives
are to (a) enhance efficiency; (b) remove distortions with regard to
production, distribution and consumption of cement; and (c) provide
adequate incentives through appropriate price structure and levels, for
capacity expansion and plant modernization in order to develop the
subsector to its full potential. GOI intends to take the following
measures in order to attain the above objectives: (i) assistance to the
industry to rehabilitate, modernize and balance obsolete plant and
equipment for improving overall capacity utilization, reducing operating
costs, mainly through conversion of outdated wet process plant technology
to the modern dry process technology, and raising productivity, through
appropriate training programs; (ii) with sufficiently enhanced production,
a progressive reduction in levy quotas leading eventually to their virtual
elimination, and changes in levy price to bring it to par with the market
price; (iii) assistance to the industry to develop and extend its marketing
and distribution capabilities to prepare itself to actively market its
products in a future market-oriented environment. These measures are
expected to accelerate under the proposed project for which IBRD financing
has been sought. In implementing these policies, GOI will take into
account the needs of the remote and cement-deficit areas. From time to
time, GOI will review all the above measures with a view to substantially
achieving the above objectives by the end of the Seventh Plan period.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
The Companies - Organization and Ownership
I.        The organization of most of the private sector companies is
similar. The Board of Directors of the companies, which include nominees
of certain state governments and representatives of financial institutions,
formulates the policies/objectives and determines the direction of the
company's activities. Except for the nominees from the financial
i-stitutions and the state government, others are appointed by the
shareholders. The Managing Director is appointed by the shareholders, but
his appointment is subject to GOI approval.
2.        As for the public sector, CCI is headed by a ten-member Board of
Directors composing the Chairman-cum-Managing Director, four executives of
CCI (Administration, Projects, Operation, and Finance) as well as one
representative each from the Ministry of Industry, Development Bank of
India (IDBI) and Life Insurance Corporation of India. The latter four are
only part time members of the Board. The Chairman and representatives of
the Ministry of Industry are appointed by the Government. The Board of
Directors sets policies and controls CCI's activities under the framework
of CCI's Articles of Association. Individual plants operate as profit
centers and are each headed by a Manager of Operations.
3.        The stocks of most of the private companies included in the
project are traded on the Indian Stock Exchange. The companies generally
are owned by three major groups of shareholders: the company promoters,
financial/investment institutions and the general public. CCI is wholly
owned by GOI. Details of the organization and brief history of each of tie
beneficiary companies under Part A of the project are to be found in the
Project File, Item 5-1, and summarized in Annex 5-1.
4.        Associated Cement Companies (ACC).  The company started in 1936,
when ten existing companies were merged into a single organization. Today,
ACC plays a major role in the cement industry, producing almost one quarter
the national output of cement at its 20 plants with an installed capacity
of 8.8 million tons of cement. With the expertise gained in the operations
of its various factories, ACC has undertaken design and manufacture of
plants to meet its own expansion needs, and for other producers in India
and abroad. The company has highly competent and experienced personnel in
the fields of geology, planning and engineering, computer technology,
research and development; it also has highly trained teams of civil
engineers, erection and commissioning staff. The company has the ability
to implement projects from initial geological prospecting to a turn-key
erection, comnissioning and start up. ACC's paid-in capital on July 31,
1984 was Rs 332.5 million, consisting of 3.3 million shares of Rs 100 par
value. The Company's shares are actively traded; individual shareholders
number over 61,000 and own over 60% of the shares; Government bodies and
Statutory Corporations own nearly 37% of the equity shares. The company
also has controlling interest in its subsidiary, ACC-Babcock Ltd. and



ANNEX 4-1
-  64                            Page 2
Associated Tyre Machinery Company, Ltd. (ATMC). ACC-Babcock manufacture
boilers, cement machinery and foundry products, while ATMC produces tire
manufacturing machinery and foundry products, brake assemblies and other
automotive-related fabrications.
5.        Birla Jute and Industries Ltd.  The company was incorporated in
August 1919, under the Indian Companies Act of 1913 and started business as
'The Birla Jute Manufacturing Company Ltd". The name of the company was
changed to Birla Jute and Industries Ltd" irt 1983. From initially
processing jute, the company has diversified over the years to include the
manufacturing of cement, polyester and viscose blended yarn, calcium
carbide, oxygen and acetylene gases and steel castings. The company's
first cement plant at Satna (Madhya Pradesh) went into production in 1959
with an initial capacity of 750 tpd which was later expanded to 1,750 tpd.
The company has also installed another plant of 2,500 tpd adjacent to the
existing plant, which went into coamercial production in 1983. The company
is in the process of converting its plant at Chittorgarh (Rajasthan) from
1,200 tpd to 2,225 tpd, which will go into operation in June 1986. The
company also has a slag grinding plant at Durgapur (West Bengal) with a
grinding capacity of 600,000 tpa. The present cement manufacturing
capacity of the company is 2.7 million tons. The company's paid in share
capital on March 31, 1985 amounted to Rs 87 million, consisting of 8.7
million ordinary shares of Rs 10 par value. The major shareholders of the
company are the Public Financial/Development Institutions (29%), companies
registered under the Companies Act (35%), and the general public (32%). Tle
company has 100Z shareholdings in its subsidiaries, India Linoleums, Assan
Jute supply Co. Ltd and Bharat Overseas Corporation.
6.        The India Cements Limited (ICL).  India Cements was incorporated
as a public limited company in 1946, with is registered office at
Madras. The company set up its first cement plant in 1949 at Sankarnagar,
Tamil Nadu, with an installed capacity of 0.12 million TPY. India Cements
operates two wet process cement plants with a total capacity of 1.4 million
TPY.  One is located at Sankarnagar and the other at Sankari, both In Tami'
Nadu in the Southern region. The Sankarnagar plant, which first started
production in 1949, consists of five kilns. The Sankari plant, which first
started production in 1964, has a capacity of 0.6 million to TPY and
consists of three kilns. In addition to the two cement plants, the company
operates a modern malleable cast iron foundry, with an installed capacity
of 5,280 tonnes a year.
7.        India Cements' paid-in share capital on March 31, 1983 amounted
to Rs 52.35 million, consisting of 9.8 million ordinary shares of Rs 5 par
value each and 33,500 preference shares of Rs 100 par value each. The
major shareholders of the company are the financial institutions and the
general public, with 48.5% and 47.3% of the shareholdings, respectively.
The company is adequately staffed with Senior Management of high caliber.
The technical personnel at the plant site are also of high caliber and
knowledgeable in the wet process technology. However, once the Sankarnagar
plant is converted, plant personnel need to be trained in the dry process
technology. India Cements proposes training most personnel locally.

8.        Cement Corporation of India (CCI).  The CCI was founded in 1965
under the companies Act of 1956 and it wholly owned by the Government of
India (GOI). Apart from a few small to medium-sized state-owned cement
companies it is the only public sector company in the industry and operates
nation-wide. In 1970, fCI started up its first cement plant of about
200,000 tpy capacity (wet process) in Mandhar, Madya Pradesh. At present
CCI operates nine plants with a total capacity of 2.7 million tpy,
representing about 6Z of total cement production capacity in India.
Besides the proposed conversion project at the Mandhar site. CCI has under
construction, a greenfield cement plant of I million tpy capability at
Tandur and is undertaking expansion/conversions at three other plants
(Madhukunda, Neemuch and Yerraguntla) from total expansion in installed
capacity of 3.9 million to tpy. In addition to manufacturing cement, CCI
provides services such as training, research and development, as well as
technical assistance in raw material exploration and operations, not only
for its own operations, but also for other companies in the cement
industry.
9.        CCI operates under the control of the Ministry of Industry and
functions according to its own Articles of Association of January 1965.
For major investments, CCI prepares feasibility studies and obtains
approval from: (i) the Ministry of Industry (Department of Industrial
Development), (ii) the Bureau of Public Enterprises; (iii) the Planning
Commission; (iv) the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of
Finance; and (v) the Public Investment Board. After their concurrence, the
Cabinet gives final approval to the investment projects submitted to it.
Annual investment programs and operating budgets are prepared by CCI
management, approved by the Ministries of Industry and Finance and executed
under CCI's own responsibility. Only major changes or substantial
deviations from the budget have to be cleared with these Ministries. While
these procedures appear involved, CCI enjoys a large degree of freedom in
proposing investments, setting personnel and operating policies and
carrying out its operations.
10.       (KCP).  The KCP Limited is a large industrial house in South
India, operating a 6,500 TPD sugar plant at Vuyyuru, Andhra Pradesh - one
of the largest plants in Asia, a heavy machinery workshop at Tiruvottiyur
in Madras, manufacturing and supplying compete sugar plants and cement
plants on a turnkey basis and general engineering items, and a cement plant
of 750 TPD capacity at Macherla in Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh. The
KCP Limited commenced its operations in 1943 and has built up a good
reputation for the quality of its products in India and abroad. It has
built up considerable financial strength and has registered a steady
increase in operations and profits over the years. Its turnover for the
year 1982/83 was about Rs 673 million with a profit of Rs 89 million before
depreciation and tax.
11.       CKA.  The Cement Manufacturers' Association was started in 1960,
with the primary objective of providing a forum through which the cement
industry could make known to the Government its views on policy and
regulatory matters affecting the industry's performance and prospects.



ANNEX 4-1
- 66-                           Page 4
Over the past 25 years, the CMA has been an effective industry spokesman
that has presented alternatives, carried out independent analyses of
Government policy and been successful ir lobbying for a number of changes.
CMA has also provided a forum for informal price stabilization by providing
suggested price ceilings as a means of dampening public criticism of
perceived or actual industry excesses (i.e., price gouging, unfair trade
practices, etc.). Membership in the CMA has been limited to cement plant
owners with rated capacities in excess of 100,000 TPY (approximately
300 TPD); the newly emerging mini cement plant owner/operators have only
been admitted as Associate Members. At the start of FY85/86, there were 47
registered members, representing nearly all manufacturers with currently
operating cement plants, and 15 associate members, of whom 7 were operating
mini zement plants and the others had large-scale projects under
construction. CMA's administrative costs are supported by annual
membership assessments.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
ACC Madukkarai Project Description
1.        Project SuMMary.  The project consists of converting the
Madukkarai plant, located in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu from wet to
semi-wet process. The five present kilns have a clinker capacity of
358,000 TPY corresponding to 380,000 TPY of OPC cement. In the conversion
the five kilns will be replaced with a new 3-stage preheater precalciner
kiln with a rated capacity of 1,500 TPD corresponding to 520,000 TPY of
OPC. The five old kilns consume 0.44 tons of coal per ton of clinker
compared to 0.26 tons for the proposed new kiln (1,656 kcal/kg clinker
versus 1,040 kcal/kg clinker, a savings of 37%). At the lower coal
consumption a higher cement strength will be attained and because of the
proposed high efficiency dust collection equipment the specific raw
material consumption will be reduced by 6%. Specific electric energy
consumption will increase from an average of 117 kWh/ton of cement to about
120 kWh/ton cement.
2.        Options Considered.  The existing kilns, installed in 1934, 1937,
1943, 1950 and 1966, are in good operating condition, however, the high
fuel consumption causes the plant to operate at a loss. The limestone is
high in silica and requires upgrading by froth-flotation. The high
moisture content resulting from flotation makes the semi-wet process the
most efficient process option. The novel approach recommended by ACC's
foreign consultants utilizes wet grinding of raw materials (carried out in
the existing rawmills), reduction of kiln feed moisture from 35% H20 to 17%
H20 by the use of vacuum filters, and drying of the filtercake in a
crusher/drier with the exhaust gases from the 3-stage preheater. The kiln
will receive dried kiln feed and function as a conventional preheater
precalciner kiln except for a slightly lower fuel efficiency due to the
drying requirements of the crusher/dryer. The 1,500 TPD preheater
precalciner kiln is the most favorable option since it requires no new
mills to be installed and none of the mills to be converted. The
froth-flotation plant (installed in 1968) is in good condition and will be
expanded by addition of two new cells as part of the proposed project. The
existing cement grinding mills are capable of producing 500,000 TPY at
about 70% operating time without any modification.
3.        Equipment Requirements.  Review of the various plant departments
identified the following equipment groups:
(a) Equipment To Be Modified - Craneway for new clinker-handling
system.
(b) Equipment To Be Abandoned - Five wet process kilns, clinker

(c) New Equipment
(i) Flotation Plant - 2 additional flotation cells.
(ii) One new vacuum filter plant with capacity of 2,400 TPD of
kiln feed.
(iii) Kiln Department - One 1,500 TPD 3-stage p_eheater kiln with
integral flash drying, clinker cooler, clinker dust
collector, clinker handling system, and coal mill.
(iv) Laboratory - Off-line X-ray and digital computer for cement
compound calculation.
(v) Power - 6 MW diesel standby power.
4.        Role of the Bank in Technical Appraisal.  Diring technical
discussions at the plant several suggestions were made to improve the
project which were accepted in principle by management. They were:
(a)  Install a trommel screen at Walayar quarry to capture some 72,000
tons of high grade limestone fines which are currently wasted.
Cb)  Change process control from total carbonate to lime saturation
factor by use of off-line X-ray.
cc)  Replace the proposed multiclone clinker dust collector with
higher efficiency dust collection equipment.
(d)  Provide 'clean rooms- to house central control room and off-line
X-ray.
The project is well planned with the proposed new equipment well integrated
with the existing plant and it permits the existing plant to operate
without interference during construction. Downtime will be held to a
minimum during changeover to the new kiln, probably less than 60 calendar
days.
5.        Raw Materials.  There are two major limestone quarries described
below.
(a)  Walayar Deposit.  Mining lease of 161 acres.  The deposit occurs
on the flank of a hill and extends into contiguous flat land with
no overburden. Foreign inclusions of clay and intrusions of
feldspars require selective mining and screening. Recent
geologic investigation has proven about 19,000,000 tons of
limestone. The haul to the plant is 19 km by truck over a well
improved asphalt road. The quarry produces 1,200 TPD in
3-shifts, 7 days per week. An hydraulic rock breaker will be
acquired to break the numerous "dobies" into sizes the crushing
plant can handle. The quarry production rate will be increased
to match the crushing plant capacity, 1,400 TPD.

Page 3
(b)  Madukkarai Deposit.  This deposlt is long and narrow.  Quarry
trucks haul stone 5 kn to the plant crushing plant. The two 4J"
jaw crushers with a cLosed circuit cone secondary crusher have a
capacity of over 1,200 TPD of 3/4" size. Production is currently
800 TPD and it will be expanded to 1,200 TPD in the near future.
The long narrow deposit requires multiple faces for efficient
operation. Sideburden is a problem and limits the depth to which
quarrying can be performed. As at Walayar quarry, intrusives
control the boundaries (limits) of high grade stone. Two
horizons of stone occur (42Z to 44% and 44% to 46% CaO), which
are quarried and stored separately for proportioning at the
plant. The chemical composition is ideal for preheater
operation. Total estimated reserves in the Madukkarai quarry are
68,000,000 tons with a sideburden ratio averaging 0.5 tons per
ton of limestone.
(c) Total Reserves. Total reserves are estimated to be:
Walayar    19,000,000 tons
Madukkarai 68,000,000 tons
Total    87,000,000 tons corresponding to over 100 years' life.
6.        Other Materials
(a)  Gypsum.  The source is Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd.,
Cochin. This by-product gypsum is hauled by road 240 km.
(b) Hematite. Annual consumption 6000 tons.
(c) Pozzolan. Annual consumption 46,000 tons.
(-) Coal. Proportion of the three sources varies:
Singareni         1,200 km      Rail
Western            1,400 km     Rail
Eastern           2,200 km      Rail
Neyvelli Lignite    500 km      Rail
7.        Power.  The present supply of 9,500 kVA at 22 kV are furnished by
Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. Percentage of downtime due to power outage
has been: 1981 0.2%, 1982 1.75%, 1983 0.5%. 18,500 kVA will be required
at project completion and a new 110 kV substation will be built. ACC plans
to increase the capacity of diesel generation, which presently is 3.14 MW.
8.        Rail.  Rail facilities are adequate (broad gauge).
9.        Road.  The plant is well connected to the road net and is only
about 40 km from Coimbatore.

for all input materials and for cement name of material, location of
source, distance from source to plant, mode of transportation (rail or
truck). Tabulation as showed for Shahabad.
12.       Environmental.  The plant design except for the proposed
multiclone dust collector for the clinker cooler vent will be adequate to
meet proposed Indian standards for particulate. No solid waste or liquid
effluent problems exist.
13.       Project Management.  The overall responsibility for project
management will rest with the projects division of ACC. A project
coordinator at Lhe projects division and a project manager at the project
site have already been nominated for the implementation of the project.
The project manager at the site will have under him a group of managers and
engineers drawn from various disciplines like civil engineering, mechanical
engineering, electrical engineering, construction planning and accountants
who will form a composite team reporting directly to the head of the
projects division. ACC's central erection team will be responsible for
installation. The detailed design for the project will be carried out by
the projects division assisted tv operations division, Madukkarai works and
by the consultant. The procurement will be done by the projects division
in close coordination with the materials, management division. A progress
and inspection unit will be set up to inspect all major and critical
machinery prior to dispatch and to monitor progress at the supplier's
works.
14.       Consultants.  Rugby Cement Consultants Ltd., UK, will be the
overall technical collaborators for the project and will be responsible for
technical aspects of the process.
15.       Implementation.  The attached implementation chart shows award of
the major machinery contract October 1985. ACC has placed this contract
with ABL, a wholly owned machinery manufacturing subsidiary. As ABL
provides the technical design data the specifications for the thirteen :CB
packages will be prepared. Civil works will start August 1986 and
commissioning will take place March 1988, 29 months after placement of the
major machinery contract.
16.       Training and Commissioning.  ACC has 17 operating cement plants.
Key personnel that will be assigned are rotated among the various plants.
The Central Training Department in Bombay will provide technical training
for various categories of technical personnel. Junior supervisors and
artisans are trained at Kymore cement works. La Farge group of France will
provide, under a current agreement, training of personnel on-site for the
new plant as well as at La Farge plants in France. Supervisors and

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
ACC Shahabad Project Description
1.       Project Summary.  The project consists of converting the present
Shahabad plant, located in the Gulbarga district of Karnataka State from
wet to dry process. The present rated capacity of the four wet kilns is
1,440 TPD of clinker corresponding to 500,000 TPY of cement. One 2,400 TPD
preheater precalciner kiln will replace the old kilns. The proposed plant
will have a clinker capacity of 3,400 TPD corresponding to 830,000 TPY of
cement. The present wet kilns operate at a fuel consumptien of
1,650 kcal/kg of clinker. The proposed new kiln will operate at
850 kcal/kg. This corresponds to a reduction from 0.442 to 0.23 tons of
coal per ton of clinker (equivalent to a savings of 48Z). Power
coLsumption is presently close to 140 kWh/ton cement and the converted
plant is expected to operate at 120 kWh/ton of cement.
2.        Options Considered.  Age and poor mechanical condition have
rendered the existing kilns obsolete and the main considerations of this
project were location, layout and capacity of the new facilities. As a
standard procedure the existing infrastructure, the market and limestone
reserves were carefully analyzed before project capacity was determined.
In this case the project layout permits a future doubling of capacity. A
large percentage of the existing equipment was found unsuitable for
integration with modern equipment and for that reason the converted plant
will contain new equipment to a high degree. The new facilities are
sufficiently separate from the existing equipment that construction can be
undertaken with a minimum interruption of the existing equipment and permit
operations to continue uninterrupted.
3.       Equipment Requirements.  Analysis of the process areas identified
the following groups of equipment:
(a) Equipment to Be Modified
(i) modification of the gantry to accept stone from a new aerial
tramway;
(ii)  upgrading of existing finish mill department.
(b) Equipment To Be Abandoned
(i) existing primary and secondary crushing system;
(ii)  existing wet process proportioning, raw milling, slurry
handling, blending and storage, wet kiln, clinker cooler and
clinker handling;
i         .t
(iii) existing coal-fired 10 MW power plant.



ANNEX 4-3
- 74 -                        Page 2
(c) New Equipment
(i)  Quarry.  New 600 TPH impact crusher; 5 km, double line,
aerial tramway, automatic discharge into the existing gantry
(storage).
(ii) Raw Material Storage. Blending/storage retrieval systems
for both limestone and coal.
(iii) Raw Mill Department. A new vertical roller mill of 250 TPH
capacity.
(iv) Kiln Feed Department. Homogenization and storage
facilities.
(v)  Kiln Department.  One 2,400 TPD 4-stage prelxeater kiln,
clinker cooler and dust collector, coal mill and coal mill
dust collector.
(vi)  Cement Storage and Packing.  One 12-spout rotary packer with
dust collector.
(vii) Electrical Power Supply and Distribution
(viii) Process Control. 1 X-ray analyzer with 'clean room".
4.        Role of the Bank in Technical Appraisal.  During technical
discussions, Bank technical staff recommended replacement of the proposed
multiclone clinker dust collector in order to meet proposed Indian emission
standards and persuaded ACC to provide 'clean room' conditions for the
central control room and X-ray room as part of the project.
5.        Raw Materials.  The present quarry utilizes a small narrow gauge
railway to haul crushed limestone 4.5 km to the plant. Detailed study
indicated that a new ropeway and a new impact crusher would he the most
favorable alternative. The quarry is extensive with the working face 2 km
long. Overburden is 1 to 3 meters in depth, no water problems and a
relatively flat, smooth floor provides excellent working conditions. The
present deposit hae 17 years' reserve at the proposed new rate.
Acquisition of contiguous reserves, estimated to contain 42 million tons of
limestone, is in progress. The chemical composition of the limestone is
favorable for preheater operation.
6.        Other Materials
(a)  Gypsum.  A blend of natural and synthetic gypsum is used, shipped
by rail for a distance of 538-1,868 km. Current consumption is
about 28,000 TPY.
(b) Red Shale. 124,000 TPY (low-grade limestone from quarry).

(c) Hematite. 12,000 TPY purchased.
(d) Pozzolan. 140,000 TPY.
(e) Coal. 220,000 TPY. Singareni, 500 km rail and truck; Western
Coal Field, 850 km rail and truck.
7.        Electric Power.  Power is received from Karnataka State
Electricity Board (KSEB) at 132,000 volts. The present contract is for
12 MVA and an application for 18 MVA will be filed for the new plant.
Power cuts have been severe; during the last two years they have varied
from 28% to 80%. The plant contains a thermal captive power plant, which
because of age and the poor quality coal is only able to produce 5 MVA.
The company plans to install two DG sets each of 3.2 MVA, which would bring
the combined captive power generation capacity to 11.4 MVA, corresponding
to 63Z of the peak requirement.
8.        Rail.  The plant is on a main broad gauge line with direct
service to Hyderabad and Bombay. More than 80% of cement is shipped by
rail.
9.        Road.  The plant is well connected to the road network in
Karnataka and enjoys truck service for input materials and 20% of cement
shipments. The nearest town is Gulbarga, some 30 km northwest.
10.       Water.  The source of water is the Kagna River which supplies the
plant and colony by a 3 km pipeline. Supply has been adequate.
11.       Transport Analysis.  Following is a summary of the transport
requirement for the plant:
Volume ('000 tons)
Distance (km)       Rail      Road
Input
Limestone                     4.5          684,000

Output
Cement                         -           660,000  170,000
12.       Environmental.  The plant design will incorporate particulate
emission discharge levels appropriate to meet the proposed Indian emission
standards of 250 mg/Nm3, which will be a great improvement over present
operation. No solid waste or liquid effluent problems were reported.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Satna Project Description
1.        The project comprises the conversion of Birla's Satna plant,
located at Satna city in Madhya Pradesh, from wet process operation to dry
process operation. The three existing wet process kilns with a combined
capacity of 1,750 tpd will be replaced by a single new preheater,
precal-iner kiln with a rated capacity of 2,250 tpd. As a result the rated
capacity of the Satna plant will increase by 29%, from 581,000 tpy to
750,000 tpy. Birla intends to file a letter of intent with the Directorate
General Technical Department (DGTD) for a license to increase the capacity
to 750,000 tpy. A 2-year-old production unit, Birla Virkas, located
adjacent to the Satna production unit, has a rated capacity of 800,000 tpy,
and with the new project the total capacity would become 1,380,000. The
contemplated incremental increase of 170,000 tpy would correspond to 12.3%
of the present total capacity.
2.        Options Considered.  The Birla engineering department considered
the following options:
(a)  modification of the existing kilns to dry process operation; and
(b)  replacement of the existing wet process kilns with a new
efficient dry process kiln.
Operation (a), modification of the existing kilns, was rejected for the
following reasons:
Ci) it would require stoppage of each of the kilns for possibly
nine months during modification with resulting loss of
production;
(ii)  the cost of modification and updating to modern controls
would become as high or higher than installing a new kiln;
and
(iii)  the resulting plant would still be based on equipment 25
years old with the inherent high maintenance costs and r4k
of breakdown.
Consequently, option (b), the installation of a new kiln, was decided on.
The 2,250 tpd capacity of the new kiln is the maximum capacity which can be
accomodated by the existing plant and quarry infrastructure. Two sites
were available as locations for the new production line - one adjacent to
the 2-year-old Vikas unit of the Satna plant (comprising a 2-year-old
800,000 tpy preheater, precalciner plant) and the other adjacent to the
original old Satna plant. The latter was chosen and this project
description is based on that location. The new kiln will operate at
830 kcal/kg clinker compared to 1,535 kcal/kg clinker in the present
kilns. Fuel savings will be on the order of 46%.

3.        Equipment Requirements.  Analyses of material flows in each of
the process areas determined which equipment should be abandoned, and which
to be modified and identified new equipment to be acquired as follows:
(a) Equipment To Be Modified
(i)  One of the existing wet rawmills will be converted to a
cement mill, which in conjunction with the existing four
cement mills will allow grinding of the rated clinker

4.        Role of Bank in Technical Appraisal.  The project is well
conceived and well prepared and no significant suggestions for change or
modifications were required. The one area where additional assistance
seemed desirable was in the area of ICB procurement where the mission
recommended that consultants with the proper experience be retained for
drafting of bid documents and for bid evaluation.
5.   Raw Materials and Other Input Materials
(a) Limestone: Birla leases from the Madhya Pradesh government 10
square kilometers of limestone deposits located 5 km from the
plant. The lease period is 20 years and the present lease must
be reviewed in 1995. Crushing will be done in the quarry in the
two existing crushers and the crushed stone is transported to the
plant by an aerial ropeway. Up to 3 meters of overburden is
found in some areas of the deposit and the deposit consists of a
12-13 meter layer of high quality limestone with a gentle dip of
only 5, which makes it easy to mine. A major geological survey
carried out in 1979 by professional geologist on an area of 1.15
square kilometers comprising 36 drill holes proved reserves of 27
million tons within the 1.15 sq km surveyed. The yearly
consumption of limestone for the new project and the Vikas unit
combined will be 2,300,000 tpy compared to an estimated 60
million tons of reserves remaining or 26 years. The chemical
composition of the limestone is well-suited for precalciner
operation as proven after two years of operation of the
precalciner kiln in the Vikas unit.
C)  Iron Ore and Laterite:  Estimated incremental yearly requirement
4,400 tpy. Birla has long-term leases on laterite deposits
200 km from Satna and purchases iron ore from various suppliers
approximately 100 km from the plant.
(c)  Gypsum:  purchased from gypsum mines in Rajastan owned and
operated by government agencies. Distance 1,100 km.
(d) Pozzolan: Birla contracts with local operators who manufacture
synthetic pozzolan from clay and coal ash provided by Birla.
Distance from the p7aat: 1-2 km.
(e) Coal: Supply allocated by the Coal Linkage Committee from
Western Coal Fields. Distance to plant 200-300 km. Price
controlled by India Coal Limited, a Government-owned company.
Infrastructure:
(a) Power: Contract with Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board (MPEB) for
8.5 MW, and captive power generation capacity of 7.5 MW.  The
present demand is 14 MW and the conversion will result in only a
minor increase in power demand.   Birla is in the process of
installing 8 MW of diesel generator capacity and 12 MW of thermal
power generating capacity.  The Vikas plant will share in the use
of lower cost captive power.

(b) Water: With the convetrsion to dry process the water consumption
will be reduced by 30D. The source of water is the Santa River
5 km from the plant.
(c)  Rail:  The plant has broad gauge spur to the S*tna railroad
station with excellent facilities.
(d)  Road.  The plant has an excellent 2 km long road to Nr,tional
Highway No. 7.

6.          Environmental Matters.  The project is designed for compliance
with the recently proposed but not yet enacted Indian standards for
pollution control. The plant will have no problems with liquid emissions
or solid waste disposal.
7.        Project Management.  Birla has been implementing two cement plant
projects during the last four years. The first project, Birla Vikas, was
commissioned in 1983 and the next project will be commissioned in early
1986. The company has a highly competent staff, and will manage and
implement this project with its own people. A consultant will be retained
to assist in preparation of bid specification, and outside contractors will
be utilized for civil works and erection and installation.
8.        Implementation.  The attached implementation chart shows award of
the major machinery contracts by December 1986 and start of civil works by
July 1986. Commissioning will take place in December '.988, 24 months after
placement of the major machinery orders.
9.        Trainin and Commissioning.  Birla is training all itq personnel
in the Birla Vikas plant, which comprises a modern 2,500 tpd precalciner
kiln. In addition the company will make use of start-up specialists
provided by the equipment suppliers. The present plant employs 800 people
and the company plans to reduce this number by natural attrition.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
CCI Project Description
1.        Project Summary.  The project consists of converting the present
Mandhar plant located in the Raipur district, Madhya Pradesh, from wet to
dry process operation. The present plant capacity is 600 TPD of clinker
corresponding to 380,000 TPY of slag cement. The converted plant will have
a rated clinker capacity of 1,200 TPD and will produce 700,000 TPY of
cement consisting of 400,000 TPY of slag cement and 300,000 TPY of pozzolan
cement. The project will improve fuel efficiency substantially. The
present kiln operates at a fuel efficiency of 1,575 kcal/kg clinker or
0.366 tons of coal per ton of clinker, while the proposed new preheater,
precalciner kiln will operate an 850 kcal/kg clinker corresponding to a
coal consumption of 0.20 ton of coal per ton clinker. Because of the
addition of 50Z slag in slag cement the corresponding fuel consumption per
ton of cement wilL be 709 kcal/kg cement and 484 kcal/kg cement,
respectively, for the present and the converted plant corresponding to a
fuel saving of 32%. The specific power consumption will increase from 96
kWh/ton to 107 kWh/ton of cement.
2.        Options Considered.  Conversion from wet to dry process can be
done by either modifying the existing kiln or by replacing the old kiln
with a new one. The capital cost of modifying a kiln is lower than the
cost of installing a new one, however, the benefits derived from a new
kiln, such as higher fuel efficiency and production and longer equipment
life will in most cases make the installation of a new kiln the best
option. In the early phase of this project eight different options were
analyzed, four of which involved semi-wet operation and four dry process.
Seven of the options were based on utilizing the existing kiln after some
modification, and the eighth option comprised the installation of a new
preheater precalciner kiln.
3.        Options 1 to 7 offered limited flexibility bcause of equipment
configuration, particularly in respect of capacity. Option 8 provided
flexibility in respect of capacity and the optimum capacity of the new kiln
was determined by considering factors such as: cement market, raw
materials reserves and plant infrastructure. After careful analysis CCI
and the consultants concluded that mainly because of plant infrastructure
considerations a kiln production of 1,200 TPD was optimum. A kiln with
1,500 TPD rated capacity will be installed in order to assure sustained
production of 1,275 TPD (85% utilization). At that capacity the raw
material deposit will last 45 years. The advantages of this option are:
L.o downtime and loss of production of the existing equipment during
construction, and low future maintenance and operations costs because of
entirely new raw mill and kiln departments.
4.        E4uipment Requirements.  Analysis of material flows in the
various process areas identified the following approach in respect of
equipment:



ANNEX 4-5
- 84 -                          Page 2
(a) Equipment to be Modified: the present raw mills to be converted
to open circuit cement mills
(b) Equipment to be Abandoned: existing wet process kiln with slurry
storage, handling and feeding equipment, clinker cooler and coal
crushing and grinding equipment
(c) New Equipment
(i)  Quarry:  Loaders, drills, compressors, and dumptrucks
(ii) Raw Material Storage: Linear preblending stockpile
(iii)  Raw Mill Department:  1 x 3,200 HP dry ball mill, 120 TPH
(iv)  Kiln Feed Department:  2 homogenizing and storage silos
(v)  Kiln Departuent:  1 x 1,500 TPD 4-stage preheater kiln with
optimum precalciniag (according to coal quality), clinker
cooler, coal mill, dust collection equipment.
(vi) Cement Storage & Packing Plant: Cement storage silos and a
packing machine
(vii)  Electrical Infrastructure:  Transformer, motor control
centers and new powerlines to quarry
5.        Role of Bank in Technical Appraisal.  During discussions of the
technical features the mission suggested various modifications which could
reduce power consumption. The mission also convinced CCI to utilize
efficient dust collection equipment for dedusting of the clinker cooler
rather than utilizing multiclones which would have prevented compliance
with the new Indian specifications for pollution control. In general, the
project concept is sound and the layout is sensible. The modified plant
will be relatively easy to operate and maintain.
6.        Raw Materials.  The raw material deposit at Pathri, 11 km from
the plant, provides both high-grade and low-grade limestones, and only 1.OZ
of additives (iron ore) must be added in order to obtain proper mix. The
chemical composition of the limestone is favorable for dry process
operation. Chemical analysis of 361 composite samples prepared from core
samples showed potassium, sodium and chloride contents to be well below the
levels critical to preheater operation. The thickness of the limestone
varies from 30 m to 35 m and it is overlaid by up to 7 m of overburden. An
exploration program based on a 150 m grid patt(Ern was performed on the 365
acres leased and 1,223 core samples were collected. The measured reserves
of limestone add up to 29 million toas of raw materials, corresponding to
45 years of operation at the proposed plant capacity.



ANNEX 4-5
- 85 -                          Page 3
7.        Other Materials
(a)  Slag:  CCI has contracted for 200,000 TPY of slag; from the
Bhilar steel plant, located 40 km from Mandhar by road.
Transportation by truck.
(b)  Gypsum:  34,000 TPY arrives by rail from Simka Chalam, a distance
of 560 km.
(c)  Iron Ore:  from Sihora purchased 475 km, rail, 8,000 TPY.
(d)  Pozzolan:  41,000 TPY arrives by truck from Raipur, only 16 km
from the plant.
(e)  Coal:  Coal is transported 200 km by rail in open wagons from the
Banki Coal Mine, Central India Coalfields (CIC). CIC suffers
from production problems, and although the plant has not run ou:
of coal recently the plant is seldom able to inventory more than
17 days of coal consumption. The present coal linkage is for
72,000 TPY per year, and the application for the new plant calls
for 80,000 tons per year. The new linkage will be confirmed as
part of the PIB license, which has been applied for.
Infrastructure
B.        Power.  The plant receives power from Madya Pradesh State
Electricity Board (MPSEB) at 33,000 volts. Peak requirement is 7 MW and
the contract calls for 9 MW. Interruption of power has been common in
recent years because of drought. The percent of power interruption was 9%
in 1979/80, 13% in 1980/81 and 14% in 1981/82. CCI completed in 1983 the
installation of a 2.4 MW diesel generating plant, which has enough capacity
to operate the combined raw mill and kiln departments of the planned new
facility. The new plant will require 12 MW. Approval of the new linkage
is automatic with the PIB license, which is pending.
9.        Rail.  The plant rail spur connects with the Mowrah-Bombay main
line (broad gauge line), and the plant reports satisfactory service.
Recently established regulations now require shipment of cement by .nit
trains of no less than 1600 tons per train. As a result CCI is extending
the track lengrh at the plant. Presently 80% of the Mandhar's production
is shipped by rail. Adequate rail service is expected.
10.       Road.  The plant is well connected to the road net, and located
only 20 km from Raipur.
11.       Water.' Water is pumped in from the Khorun river for a distance
of 10km, and no supply problems have been ;geported. Once -he plant
converts to dry process operation the consumption of water .ill be reduced
to less than 1/3 of the present consumption.
12.       Transport Analysis.  The transport requirements for the plant are
sumarized In the table below:

Cement                       -                  560             140
13.       Environmental.  The plant and the equipment will be designed to
comply with the new standards drafted by the Indian StandarIs Institute for
particulate emission, which set a limit of 250 mg/Nm3. No problems with
solid waste or liquid effluents exist.
14.       Project Management.  The Mandhar project will be executed by
CCI's project department, which has completed four 400,000 TPY cement plant
projects during the last four years, and has three projects, each of 1
million TPY capacity, under implementation. During the course of all these
projects the CCI staff has acquired extensive experience in designing and
executing cement plant projects. For this project design and engineering
will be provided under turnkey arrangement in connection with the large ICB
equipment package. Equipment will be procured under ICB for the major
packages (to be financed by the Bank) and by local competitive bidding for
the small items produced in India.  Civil _orks and erection will be
awarded under local competitive bidding in two major packages (according to
location). Electrical installation will be bid as part of electrical
supply contracts. A project general manager, located at Mandhar, will have
overall project responsibility, and the project will be closely monitored
by a project group at headquarters, which will receive project progress
reports at regular intervals. A site manager, reporting to the general
manager of project, will be responsible for the day-to-day activities in
the field. CCI will act as general contractor for the project.
15.       Implementation.  The attached implementation chart shows award of
the major equipment package by May 1987 and start of civil works by July
1987. Commissioning is scheduled for December 1989. The most critical
stage is project approval by GOI through the Public Investment Board (PIB).
16.       Training and Commission.  CCI does not plan to contract outside
help for training nor to send CCI personnel overseas for training. CCI's
existing, modern dry process plants and the training facility at Neemuch
provide ample facilities for training the Mandhar operations personnel. In
addition, CCI has the opportunity tc participate in an industry-wide,
infirmal arrangement for sending operating perscnnel for training at
competitor plants with modern equipment. A special commissioning team will
be assembled of personnel from the varicus plants with recent start-up
experience. Considering the size and complexity of CCI's other projects



ANNEX 4-5
7 -                             Page 5
(and in particular the green fields projects) it should be easy for CCI to
manage this project and the decision not to retain outside consultants
seems justified. Between plant and quarry 806 people are employed. CCI
plans to operate the converted plant without any additional hiring.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
India Cement Ltd.: Sankarnagar Project Description
1.        Project Summary.  The project consists of converting the present
Sankarnagar plant located in the Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu, from wet
to dry process operation. The present capacity of the five wet process
kilns is 2,200 TPD of clinker corresponding to 726,000 TPY of clinker. The
converted plant will have a clinker capacity of 3,000 TPD (990,000 TPY)
corresponding to 1,042,000 TPY of cement. In addition to increasing
production, the project will significantly improve fuel efficiency. The
present kilns operate at a fuel consumption of 1,430 kcal/kg or 0.338 tons
of coal per ton of clinker, while the proposed new kiln will require 850
kcal/kg or a coal consumption of 0.201 tons of coal per ton of clinker.
The specific power consumption will increase from 106 kWh/ton to
116 kWh/ton of cement.
2.        Options Considered.  The process conversion can be done either by
modifying the existing kilns or replacing them with a new one. The capital
cost of modification of the existing kilns is lower than the cost of
installing a new one, however the benefits derived from a new kiln, such as
reduced fuel consumption, increased production, longer equipment life, and
higher capacity utilization will in most cases make the installation of a
new kiln the superior option. In the preparation of this project ICL
authorized a detailed study of a semi-wet conversion for consideration and
also evaluated dry process plants of 2,600 TFD and 3,000 TPD capacities.
Table I presents a comparison of production capacities, energy consumption,
energy cost and capital cost of the existing plant and the three proposed
options.

a/ Average for all cement, OPC + PPC at 50% each.
After careful analysis of the four options it was found that option IV
provided the best return on investment. The 3,000 tpd capacity is the
maximum which can be sustained by the existing infrastructure.
3.        Equipment Requirelments.  Analysis of material flows in each
process area identified equipment to be modified or abandoned.

(a) Equipment to be Modified: one 2,000 HP wet rawmill to be
ca=verted to cement grinding if the existing cement mills will
not attain rated output, two existing coal mills to fire the new
kiln.
(b) Equipment to be Abandoned:
(i) the existing wet raw mills (one may be modified to grind
cement);
(ii) slurry storage and kiln feed systems;
(iii) five wet process kilns including clinker coolers and dust
collection equipment; and
(iv) four of the six coal mills.
(c)  New Equipment:  Primary limestone crusher, limestone and coal
preblending, storage and reclamation system, raw grinding and
drying system, 3,000 TPD preheater-precalciner kiln and clinker
cooler, electrostatic precipitator for cleaning kiln and raw mill
exhaust gases, a 35-40 TPH coal mill with ESP dust collector,
clinker silo, one rotary cement packing machine, a 110,000 volt
substation and transformer, and a 2/4 MVA diesel generator.
4.        Role of Bank in Technical Appraisal.  During discussions of the
technical features of the feasibility report, the mission suggested various
modifications to the material handling system to reduce power consumption.
The mission was also able to dissuade ICL from using multiclones for
dedusting clinker cooler exhaust air which would have prevented ICL from
complying with the new Indian standards for pollution control.  In general,
the project concept is sountd, well laid out and should provide a plant that
is relatively easy to operate and maintain.
5.        Raw Materials.  Proven limestone reserves (to a depth of 30
meters) total 25.5 million tons of which 14.4 million tons is contained in
ICL leased land and 11.1 million tons in land operated by independent
quarry operators under contract to ICL. By quarrying to a depth of 72
meters an additional 30.3 million tons of limestone becomes available
(currently classified as -indicated- reserves). The quarries are located
from 3 to 15 km from the plant. Based on an annual consumption of
1,584,000 tons of limestone the present reserves would supply the proposed
plant for 28 years. The geology of the limestone is complicated by local
intrusives. The limestone is steeply dipping (80), folded and intruded by
igneous rock. By harvesting stone from a large number of quarries
simultaneously, suitable chemistry can be maintained without sacrificing
reserves. An overburden to limestone ratio of 2:1 will result by mining to
a depth of 60 meters. Alkali and chloride levels are low enough to assure
stable preheater operation. Some areas of the deposit are high in MgO but
by careful blending from the various quarries, a suitable MgO level can be
maintained without sacrificing reserves. An overburden to limestone ratio



ANNEX 4-6
- 91 -                           Page 3
of 2:1 will result by mining to a depth of 60 m. Alkali and chloride
levels are low enough to assure stable preheater operation. Some areas of
the deposit are high in MgO but by careful blending from the various
quarries, a suitable MgO level can be maintained. ICL has initiated a
comprehensive mining program which includes a major part of the quarry
equipment necessary for the new plant. In addition, they are installing
picking tables to improve limestone quality and extend quarry life beyond
that currently proven.
7.        Other Materials
(a) Red Mud: Iron-rich waste from the nearby Mettur aluminum plant
which is used as a raw mix component. Ample quantity is
available to supply the projected 30,000 TPY required. Delivery
is by truck.
(b) Pozzolan: Two materials are used. They are fly ash and surki
(a synthetic). Fly ash comprises 60% of the requirement. Both
materials are trucked to the plant.
Cc) Gypsum: The deposit at Tuticorin, some 100 km distant, supplies
current needs by truck delivery. Ample quantity is available.
(d) Coal: The present linkage is for 244,000 TPY. The estimated
future consumption is 210,000 TPY. Shown below are sources of
supply and modes of transportation estimated for the proposed
plant.

a!  By ship to Madras, then truck to plant.
b/ Loaded at mine on standard gauge rail but transloaded to narrow gauge
for final delivery to plant.
Coal supplies have not been reliable both as to quality and delivery. ICL
initiated use of lignite in 1982 and currently uses some 15-20% blended
with coal.
Infrastructure
7.        Power.  The plant receives power at 11,000 volts from Tamil Nadu
Electricity Board (TNSEB) under a contract for 15 MVA of capacity. The new
plant will require 25 MVA, which has been the linkage applied for. Drought
conditions during the last two years reduced power supply by about 50%.
Accordingly, the plant is in the process of completing the installation &f
6 MVA of diesel generating sets, and 2/4 MVA of additional diesel generator



ANNEX 4-6
- 92                ~             Page 4
capacity will be installed in connection with the proposed project. The 10
MVA of captive power capacity will permit the raw mill and kiln departments
to operate during power cuts. In connection with the higher demand, grid
voltage will be increased to 110,000 volts and new poverlines will be
installed together with new substation and transformer station.
8.        Rail.  The plant is served by both broad and narrow gauge rail
facilities. All of the coal shipments by rail originate on board gauge
lines and are transloaded to narrow gauge before arriving at the plant.
All shipments of cement leave on board gauge rail cars. ICL reports that
plans have been worked out for replacing the narrow gauge rail by broad
gauge so that transloading of coal will be eliminated.
9.        Road.  The plant is located on State Highway 7 near Tirunelveli
and receives the majority of supplies and raw materials by truck.
10.       Water. The Tambraporni River supplies plant water.  Adequate
supply is reported. Consumption will drop to less than half the current
rate. Pumping distance is 10 km.
11.       Transport Analysis.  The transport requirements for the project
are summarized in the following table.

12.       Environmental Considerations.  The plant will be designed and
equipment specified to comply with the new standards drafted by the Indidn
Standards Institute for particulate emission, which limits such particulate
to 250 mg/Nm3. No problems with solid or liquid effluents exist.
13.       Project Management.  ICL will set up a project management group
as shown on the attached organization chart. The company intends to retain
a highly experienced foreign consultant who will be responsible for:



ANNEX 4-6
93                            Page 5
selection of process, plant layout, preparation of bid specification, bid
evaluation, periodic project review, training, commissioning. The foreign
consultant will also install a microcomputer system for project management
and financial monitoring. An Indian consultant will be responsible for
construction drawings and design of infrastructure. The major equipment
packages will be bic tartly as turnkey.
14.       Implementation.  The attached implementation chart shows award of
the major machinery contracts by November 1986. Civil works commences
April 1987 and commissioning -- -1 take place October 1988, 23 months after
placement of the major machin    orders.  The schedule is tight, but ICL
has an experienced construction team, which has managed the ongoing
rehabilitation projects. The equipment manufacturers both in India and
overseas are not booked heavily and ICL can expect to obtain short delivery
time on the equipment.
15.       Training and Commissioning.  ICL proposes to send key personnel
to major machinery suppliers for training and within India for start-up and
operations training on similar equipment. ICL also proposes to contract
the foreign consultant for in-house training and for training of selected
personnel abroad. The same consultant will also assist in plant
commissioning. In addition, the company has dedicated a full-time repair
and maintenance crew for commissioning and start-up, reporting directly to
the project manager. The plant employs 2,314 people between plant and
quarry. ICL plans to reduce this number to 1,554. Of the reduction of 760
people, 425 will be obtained by natural attrition, and 335 by severance
arrangement.

INDIA - CENENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
The KCP Ltd. Macherla Cement Factory
1.        Project SuImary.  The project consists of modernizing the present
Macherla plant located in the Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, by
replacing the two present kilns with a new precalciner, preheater kiln.
The capacity of the two present kilns (one wet process and one dry process)
is 730 TPD of clinker corresponding to 254,000 TPY of cement. The new kiln
will have a capacity of 1,200 TPD of clinker corresponding to 370,000 TPY
of cement. The old kilns operate at 1,600 kcal/kg clinker while the new
kiln will produce at 800 kcal/kg, a savings of 50Z. The new plant will
have greater power efficiency with a projected consumption of 120 kWh/ton
cement compared to 133 kWh/ton in the present plant.
2.        Options Considered.  Five options were considered for the process
conversion or modernization of the plant. Two involved conversion of the
wet kiln to dry process, and two considered a new preheater kiln without
precalciner. The fifth involved the present configuration which was found
optimum when layout, infrastructure limitations, market and raw material
reserves were considered. The advantages of the chosen option are listed
as:
(a) latest technology;
(b) low operating cost;
(c) no loss of current production;
(d) large reductions in fuel and electrical energy;
(e) ability to use lower-grade coal;
(f)  ability to use lower-grade limestone which extends reserves and
reduces quarry cost; and
(g) improved plant layout resulting in lower capital cost.
3.        Equipment Requirements
(a) Equipment To Be Modified. Convert the limestone tramway from
manual to mechanized unloading; secondary crusher by increasing
grate openings; convert one dry rawmill to cement grinding;
increase capacity of limestone tramway by new, larger motor drive
and additional buckets. All buckets will be modified to bottom
dump.
(b) Equipment To Be Abandoned. Existing wet and dry process kilns,
with all auxiliaries.



- 96 -                           ANNEX 4-7
Page 2
(c) New Equipment
(i) quarry, one 3.2 m3 loader, one 35 t dumper, lighting,
miscellaneous tools for shop;
(ii) raw material handling and storage: one overhead traveling
crane (10 t);
(iii)  raw mill department:  one 125-TPH vertical roller mill;
(iv)  kiln department:  one double-deck homogenizing and storage
silos with 6,000 tons capacity;
(v)  kiln department:  one 1,200-TPD, 5-stage preheater kiln
precalciner, one 17 TPH coal mill and dust collection,
clinker cooler with baghouse and heat exchanger, clinker
deep bucket conveyor;
Cvi)  cement packing and bag-handling equipment:  two new 60-TPH
rotary packing machines and related handling equipment;
(vii) electrical infrastructure: new incomer panel boards,
switchgear, breakers, motor control centers, metering, and
distribution systems and captive power installation; and
(viii)  instrumentation and process control:  electronic
weighfeeders, weighbins, PID controllers, programmable
controllers, central control room, analog controllers for
sequence interlocking, off-line x-ray analyzer utilizing
manual sample preparation.
4.        Raw Materials.  The raw material deposits leased by KCP are
located on the Macherla-Srisailam road 10 km from the plant. Total
reserves exceed 32 million tons of which 13.6 million tons are contained in
the Polepally leased area and 18.7 million tons in the Mandadi leased
area. Thickness of the limestone averages 12.5 m and is covered with 1-8 m
of calcareous clay. The limestone dips at 5-10SE. The content of alkalis
and chlorides in the raw materials are only in trace amounts which make
them suitable for the project. By installation of a preheater, precalciner
coal ash absorption will be reduced to a significant degree which will
permit use of lower-grade limestone and extend reserve life of the
deposits. The proven reserves total 32 million tons which will provide
approximately 50 years of limestone at a production rate of 400,000 TPY
(clinker), the proposed plant capacity.
5.        Other Materials
(a) Laterite. Purchased from Kavali, Nelur, A.P., 250 km.
(b)  Bauxite.  Purchased from Belgaum, 500 km.



97 -                             ANNEX 4-7
Page 3
(c)  Gypsum   20,000 tons per year by rail from Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu,
a distance of about 600 km.
(d) Coal. Coal is transported by rail 300 km from Singareni. The
future requirement is 90,000 TPY which is less than the present
consumption of 110,000 TPY. At present the rail is meter gauge
but Indian Railways is constructing a standard gauge line to
Macherla which may be completed in 1987. In times of shortage,
coal is obtained in bulk and hauled to the plant by truck about
200 km from the Hyderabad area.
Infrastructure
6.        Power.  The plant has installed equipment for receiving power at
132 volts, and is awaiting hook-up.  The present sanctioned electrical
demand is 6.5 MW but the converted plant will require 10 MW which has been
applied for. APSEB has supplied adequate power without major outages and
the additional power required will not present a problem.                 1
7.        Rail.  Macherla is presently served by a meter gauge line which
creates delays in shipments of materials in and cement out. A broad gauge
line is under construction and is planned to be in operation serving
Macherla in 1987.
8.        Road.  Macherla is well connected by roads to Guntur, Hyderabad
and Vijaywada. The nearest city, Guntur, is about 120 km from the plant.
A road exists between the quarry and plant which can be used to haul
limestone in the event of tramway failure.
9.        Water.  Well water is available in ample quantity at the plant
site.
10.       Transport Analysis.  The transport requirements for the plant are
summarized below:
Distance              Volume in 1,000 tons

(250,QOO)
11.       Environmental.  The plant will install suitable cost control
systems in order to comply with the proposed Indian Standard emission limit
for particulate matter of 250 mg/Nm3. No solid waste or liquid effluent
problems are known to exist.



ANNEX 4-7
- 98 -                           Page 4
12.       Project Management.  The Macherla project will be executed by a
team consisting of Senior Managers and engineers from the plant and
corporate office. A consultant was retained to prepare the initial
feasibility study and project report. ENTEC Consultancy Bureau of Madras
will assist KCP with engineering for the electrical, instrumentation and
control systems. KCP will receive assistance from their overseas partner
throughout the project and during commissioning. A project manager located
in their Madras office will have overall project responsibility. A Bombay
civil contractor has been retained for the civil works. A site manager,
reporting to the project director, will have day-to-day authority and
responsibility for all field activities, providing liaison between contract
operations. In order to prevent interference with the existing operatiots,
a separate task force will be established to supervise erection, start-up
and commission the new plant. A full-time maintenance crew will be
available to the task force during start-up and commissioning to enhance
schedule.
13.       Implementation.  The attached implementation schedule shows award
for the major machinery contract by February 1986. KCP will place this
order with KCP-Fuller, a joint venture between KCP and Fuller-USA. The
specifications for the four ICB packages will be prepared as soon as the
technical design data are received from KCP-Fuller. Civil works will
commence November 1986 and commissioning is scheduled for December 1987,
22 months after placement of the major machinery order.
14.       Training and Commissioning.  A training program for key operating
personnel will be conducted by KCP's US partner. Mechanical, electrical
and instrumentation maintenance personnel will receive training as well as
process control and laboratory personnel. Training methods will include
lectures, case studies, process simulation and actual operation experience
in other similar existing plants. The plant employs 400 people only and 50
people in the quarry. The company will rely on natural attrition to reduce
staff. No additional personnel will be hired.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Technical Assistance to Cement Industry
Introduction
1.        The Indian Cement Industry is going through a phase of
unprecedented growth in installed capacity. The Government of India (GO)
has projected the installed capacity to rise to about 60 million tons by
1989/90, the last year of the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, from the
present capacity of 42.5 million tons per year. It has further projected
the capacity to increase to about 99 million tous by 2000.  Due to this
unprecedented growth, the demand for trained personnel has also grown very
rapidly and individual cement plant units are experiencing a hign turn-over
rate at the operational and technical level as a result of competition
among companies for the insufficient number of skilled staff. Unless
intensive and systematic efforts are undertaken to develop a aufficiently
large pool of human resources, the long-range growth of the cement industry
itself could be jeopardized.
Manower Needs
2.        GOI appointed a panel to survey manpower requirements for the
Indian cement industry. According to the findings of the panel, the
present total direct employment in the cement industry is estimated to be
about 100,000 and it is expected to go up by about 25,000 during the
Seventh Five-Year Plan, i.e., 1985 to 1990. The direct employment is
further expected to increase by about 60,000, thus reaching a total figure
of 185,000 by 2000. The bulk of additional requirements during the Seventh
Five-Year Plan period is expected to be in the categories of skilled
technicians, operators, foremen, and junior officers. It is evident that
the 25% increase in manpower cannot be met without large-scale planned
efforts to train personnel in specific, identified disciplines. Failure to
attain the required skills of cement plant personnel would prevent the
industry from obtaining the projected capacity of the many new plants. The
new large plants utilizing sophisticated control system are particularly
sensitive to the skill level of plant operators and training should,
therefore, be planned to meet this high-level skill resulting from the
change to higher level technology.
Scope of the Training Component
3.        The training component will be directed to all levels of cement
company staff, but will emphasize both the pre- and post-entry training of:
(a) lower-level maintenance technicians: fitters, welders,
instrument mechanics, diesel mechanics, and masons;
(b) higher-level maintenance technicians engaged in instrumentation
and processes control, electronics, power electronics, and



ANNEX 4-8
- 101 -                       Page 2
programmable controls, who will receive specialized training on
the following equipment: gear boxes, material-handling
equipment, fluid-handling equipment, pollution control equipment,
and cement manufacturing equipment (e.g., mills, kilns);
(c)  plant operators:  kiln operators (burners), mill operators,
control room operators, heavy equipment operations, and
laboratory technicians.
(d) first-level supervisors, i.e., whose training poses an uncommon
problem in that insufficient numbers are being supplied through
promotion and will have to be recruited from among fresh diploma
holders and then trained in both the technical and supervisory
aspects of cement plant operations and maintenance.
4.        To define medium- and long-range manpower and training needs and
a subsector strategy for addressing those needs, the Cement Manufacturers'
Association (CHA) will sponsor a comprehensive manpower development study
(see Terms of Reference, Attachment 1). The study will include, inter
alia, an assessment of alternative training arrangements such as (a) the
feasibility of expanding industry-owned training facilities and
'b) technical and physical inputs needed by the country's Industrial
Training Institutes (ITIs) and Advanced Training Institutes (ATIs). These
institutions are the source of basic training for maintenance technicians t
the lower and higher levels respectively. Additional inputs would enable
them to teach cement technology at the pre- and post-recruitment stages.
5.        Besides the manpower development study and inputs to the ATIs and
ITIs, the project will finance training equipment, training consultancy
services, and overseas training required by the six subproject companies
(see breakdown of lending and schedule of implementation in Attachments 2
and 3). For each subproject unit, there will be funds available to acquire
process simulation software and requisite hardware. Associated Cement
Companies Limited (ACC) and the Cement Corporation of India (CCI) will
upgrade and expand in-house training facilities through the purchase of
equipment, as well as through consultancy. It is envisaged that this
technical assistance vill build up in-house capacity to develop curricula
and training trainers to the point of reaching training self-sufficiency
(see Attachment 4). Several companies will sent staff overseas. Technical
and managerial staff will receive specialized training in operations and
maintenance at suppliers" plants, and company training officers will be
trained how to organize and develop fully the training function at the
company and plant levels.

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Manpower Development Study
Terms of Reference
Introduction
l.        The Indian Cement Industry is going through a phase of
unprecedented growth in installed capacity. The Government of India has
projected the installed capacity to rise to about 60 million tons by
1989/90, the last year of the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, from the
present capacity of 42.3 million tons per year. They have further
projected the capacity to increase to about 99 million tons by 2000. Due
to this unprecedented growth, the demand for trained personnel has also
grown very rapidly. As a result, individual cement plant units are
experiencing a high turn-over rate among at the operational and technical
level as a result of competition among companies for the insufficient.
number of skilled staff. Unless intensive and systematic efforts are
undertaken to develop a sufficiently large pool of human resources, the
long-range growth of the cement industry itself could be jeopardized. The
advent of modern technology and higher degree of mechanization provides an
opportunity to establish new standards for labor productivity.
2.        The Cement Manufacturers' Association (CMA) proposes to carry out
a study leading to the development of a comprehensive subsector manpower
development strategy. The study will identify and describe the industry's
requirements for skilled manpower through 1995, which would permit the
attainment of optimal levels of operational efficiency and resource
utilization in cement production. The strategy would enhance overall
manpower planning at the macro and micro levels in terms of both numbers
and skill needs of cement company personnel. It would provide for optimal
utilization of existing human resources and underpin systematic
retraining. Through the efficient use of new technology, it would lower
production costs and upgrade the quality of cement.
Objectives of the Study
3.        The objective of the study would be to identify practices and
procedures for developing the skills necessary to operate and maintain
cement plants and to apply the latest technology, by:
(a) assessing the requirements of the industry for pre- and
post-entry training, as well as those for recycling-and
retraining of staff;
(b) assessing the present and potential contribution of training
institutions operated by the national and state governments;
(c) examine and evaluate existing plans and proposals for
industry-sponsored training facilities; and

(d)  prepare (i) terms of reference for technical assistance programs
to review and modify curricula and to train trainers at internal
and external training institutions, and (ii) equipment lists for
these institutions.
Scope of the Study
4.        The study will be carried out in three phases: Preparation,'Data
Collection, and Data Analysis and Report Preparation.
Phase I:  Preparation
5.        During this phase, the consultants will be responsible for:
(a)  assisting TAG in drafting a charter.  TAG will have overall
responsiblity for supervision, guidance, and monitoring of the
consultants' work;
(b)  clarifying with TAG terms of reference and the kind and amount of
logistical support that TAG can provide the consultants;
Cc)  selecting, in consultation with TAG, a representative sample of
companies to be visited by the cont-ultants;
(d)  preparing a standard set of formats for manpower and in-service
training inventories to be distributed to all cement companies in
India. All formats will show breakdowns of staff categories in
the following way: a separate category for each benchmark
position in which the incumbent is a graduate engineer, diploma
holder, or skilled worker engaged in mining, processing, or
maintenance, with remaining staff grouped into the broad
occupational categories of corporate planning, administrative
support services, financial support services, and unskilled
workers. The formats will be designed to quantify:
(i) current staffing strength with breakdowns by age group;
(ii) highest level of educational attainment, to include a
separate breakdown for engineers with MBAs; and
(iii)  in-service training broken down by mode (i.e., formal, or
institutionalized, and non-formal) and category of training
(i.e., induction training, basic training, refresher
training, retraining, management development). In-service
training will be quantified in terms of both trainee places
and man weeks of training. In addition, explicit
instructions for completing the forms and a glossary of
training terminology will be attached;
(e) preparing questionnaires to accompany the above forms, requesting
information on:

benchmark positions or broad occupational groupings) that
must be improved to remove those bottlenecks;
(ix)  institutional weaknesses and the specific skills that must
be improved to strengthen managerial capacity;
(x) use of educational aids and media production, including
mimeographed handouts;
(xi)  mechanisms for evaluating training effectiveness;
(xii)  constraints to manpower development (e.g., budget
allocations, training staff, inability to retain qualified
staff, inaccessibility of in-service training
resources/facilities);
(xiii) quality and relevance of pre-entry education and training,
with particular attention to the Advanced Training
Institutes (ATIs) and Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs)
and their potential contribution to pre- and in-service
training;
(xiv)  demand for in-service training facilities shared with other
cement companies; and
(xv)  in the professional judgment of the consultants, all otber
matters relevant to the objectives of the survey and its
analytical and reporting requirements;

described in paragraphs (c) and (d) above;



ANNEX 4-8
Attachment I
- 105 -                    Page 4
(g)  planning and organizing a Management Seminar on Manpower
Development of two to three days' duration. The objective of the
seminar will be to introduce the methodology of the study and
explain the purpose of the data collection exercise, as well as
providing adequate background information and guidelines on
completing the forms. The seminar will include lectures on
topics such as manpower forecasting and planning, institutional
analysis, performance appraisal, training needs assessment, and
management development followed up by workshops and small group
discussions on the data collection forms intended to help solve
problems of definition, nomenclature, and personnel/training data
classification. It is expected that at least one senior manager
and one personnel or training officer from each cement company '"n
India, and a number of director-level staff from external
training support agencies, will be in=-ited to participate in the
seminar;
(h) establishing together with TAG criteria for review and analysis
of data; and
1i) agreeing with TAG on the structure, content, and format of the
final report.
Phase II: Data Collection
6.        During this phase, the consultants will be responsible for:
(a) conducting the Management Seminar on Manpower Development;
(b)  visiting educational and training agencies and institutions, such
as the National Cement and Building Materials Institute (formerly
called the Cement Research Institute), Institute of Manpower
Development, Directorate of Employment and Training (Ministry of
Labor), selected ATIs and ITIs, and corresponding state agencies
responsible for the ITIs, to define the scope of their
contribution to industry manpower development and to explore
their future roles. Two ATIs will be selected in consultation
with TAG, with a view of introducing a follow-up course relevant
to cement technology. Four to six ITIs will be selected in
consultation with TAG, on the basis of geographical proximity to
areas vith heavy concentrations of ceaent plants, with a view to
establishing six-month, specialized training programs for the
cement industry at the pre-recruitment stage. Discussions with
officers at all agencies and institutions will focus on the
training of maintenance technicians, plant operators, and
first-level supervisors, with particular emphasis on
instrumentation and process control, electronics, mechanical
equipment, maintenance, and heavy earth-moving machinery; and
(c) visiting companies' headquarters and plants to assist with the
data collection exercise by further clarification of methodol gy



ANNEX 4-8
Attachment 1
- 106 -                   Page 5
and terminology to ensure the reliability and uniformity of the
data. The visits will also involve interviewing senior officials
and engineers to follow up on and clarify data being supplied in
the questionnaires (para. 5(e)).
Phase III: Data Analysis and Report Preparation
7.        During this phase, the consultants will be responsible for:
(a)  assessing existing manning levels and forecasting the industry's
requirements for trained manpower through the end of 1995, by
benchmark position and broad occupational grouping, consistent
with international standards for establishing manpower
coefficients to optimize labor productivity;
(b)  assessing existing training activities, programs, and resources
both within and external to the industry in terms of their
qualitative and quantitative ability to satisfy new skill
requirements precipitated by modern technology and higher degree
of mechanization;
Cc)  assessing serious operational deficiencies and institutional
weaknesses resulting from lack of skills, with a ranking of
corresponding benchmark positions in terms of priorities for
short-, medium-, and long-term corrective action; and
Cd)  outlining in depth a range of alternatives for addressing the
industry's requirements for trained manpower over the next ten
years. These alternatives would take into account:
(I) training approaches for correcting skill deficiencies,
particularly those resulting from the introduction of modern
technology;
(ii) advantages and disadvantages of establishing new training
facilities and modifying existing ones within the
subsector. The consultants will specify various financing
and funding arrangements and means of apportioning trainee
places among cement companies, and geographic location of
possible facilities. They will raise and provide advice on
critical issues relating to ownership of, and operating
responsibility for, various training facilities, i.e.,
should new or expanded training centers be owned and
operated by individual companies, through bilateral and
multilateral agreement, or under the auspices of CKA? and
(iii) advantages and disadvantages of establishing linkages with
formal vocational training systems under the Ministry of
Labor and state governments. The consultants will assess
the viability of desirable linkages and specify additional
inputs needed by these institutions to build up their



ANNEX 4-8
Attachment 1
- 107 -                    Page 6
capacity to teach cement technology. Such inputs are likely
to include technical assistance for (a) curriculum
development and the training of trainers, and
(b) procurement of laboratory and workshop equipment,
including the costs and financial arrangements for these
inputs.
Final Reports
8.        The consultants will submit th-ree separate final reports
covering:
(a) findings of manpower and training studies, with issues and
alternative solutions, including a plan for building up training
expertise industrywide through training of in-plant trainers and
training officer corps, and through improving the management,
instruction, and curricula at company-owned training centers;
(b) proposal for additional training facilities to be owned and
operated within the industry, including blueprints, equipment
lists, and a detailed investment plan; and
(c)  detailed action plan for upgrading ATIs and ITIs, and any other
training institution identified in the study as a potential
source of pre- and in-service training, in respect of the
introduction of cement technology. This will include terms of
reference for technical assistance for curriculum development and
training of trainers, to be funded under the proposed Bank loan,
and preparation of detailed training equipment lists, also to be
financed under the proposed Bank loan.
Consultant Team
9.        The study would require a total of 33 man-months of consultancy
over a six-month period. It is expected that foreign consulting firms
bidding for the contract will make an effo_z to rely on local consultant
expertise to the extent it is available. An inter-disciplinary team, which
will report directly to TAG, will be composed of six experts with following
backgrounds and lead responsibilities:
(a) One industrial training specialist, with ten years' internatibnal
experience in implementing training programs in both private and
public sectors, who will lead the team by preparing a detailed
work program and assigning tasks and additional responsibilities
(six months);
(b)  One chemical or industrial engineer, with ten years' operational
experience in the cement industry and at least five years'
experience in management and training, who will delineate

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Cement Corporation of India
Training Consultancy
Terms of Reference
Introduction
1.        The Cement Corporation of India (CCI) takes a systematic,
comprehensive approach to manpower development. The training function ia
well established companywide, and it is being expanded to provide each unit
within the company with one part-time training officer and one full-tise
instructor. In fact, the company is close to becoming self-sufficient in
training. Technical assistance, proposed by CCI and reviewed with the Bank
post-appraisal training mission, is needed for curriculum review and
training of trainers to address special training needs arising from recent
technological advance in the conversion to dry processing. The emphasis
will be on helping the professional training staff at the company's
Neemuch Training Institute (NTI) to accomplish these objectives theirelves
rather than performing the tasks for them.
ObJectives
2.        The objectives of this training consultancy would be to update
the curriculum at NTI and train in-plant instructors, and at the same time
help CCI become self-sufficient in training by strengthening the capacity
the NTI staff to develop its own training modules and train its own
trainers.
Curriculum Review
3.        The consultants will be responsible for assisting NTI staff in:
(a) describing, within each broad occupational grouping
(executives, supervisors, operations), key benchmark positions,
i.e., job categories with functions critical to the company's
planned expansion in installed capacity, conversion to dry
processing, and overall objectives. Such description is to
include functions, duties, responsibilities, tasks, and skills
needed to carry out those tasks, specifically including those
skills required by the introduction of new technology (6 weeks);
(b)  interviewing key plant personnel at all levels to
identify performance bottlenecks and, in aggregate, the specific
skills (matched against standard bencbhark requirements) that
must be improved in order to remove the bottlenecks, including
the removal of skill deficiencies arising from the introduction
of new technology (5 weeks);



ANNEX 4-8
Attachment 4
- 114 -                     Page 2
(c)  interviewing key administrative and financial personnel at all
levels to identify institutional weaknesses and, in aggregate,
the specific skills (matched against standard benchmark
requirements) that must be improved in order to strengthen
mnnagerial capacity (3 weeks);
(d) assessing the content and methodology of existing training
programs, as well as their relevance to training needs and the
training situation or purpose (i.e., whether the program is
intended as induction training, basic training, refresher
training, retraining or management development). This will
include monitoring and evaluation and strengthening CCI's
capacity to assess and meet its own training needs (7 weeks); and
(e) implementing recommended improvements to the training programs,
including monitoring and evaluation, and strengthening in-house
capacity for curriculum development (16 weeks).
Training of Trainers
4.        The consultants will be responsible for:
(a) asssisting in developing or adapting a set of modules for the
training of trainers specific to the cement industry and
conversion to dry processing. These modules will correspond with
the broad areas of expertise of the existing instructors at the
Neesuch Training Institute and will introduce new areas in which
upgraded skills are needed (12 weeks);
(b) deliverying the complete set of modules to all instructors
through lectures, seminars, and workshops (8 weeks);
(c) coaching each instructor in training of trainers in his
respective area of expertise. The objective would be to provide
him with the capability of training instructors at operating
units to develop the skills and knowledge of plant personnel in
respect of subjects and operational functions relevant to the
area of expertise (4 weeks); and
(d) monitoring and evaluation of the transfer of the complete set of
modules to selected units to ensure the self-contained,
self-sustaining ability of CCI to train its own in-house trainers
(16 weeks).
Consultant Team
5.        The consultancy would require a total of 57 man-months over a
19-month period.  It is expected that foreign consultiag firms Lidding on
the contract will make an effort to rely on local consultant expertise to
the extent it is available. The consultant team will be composed of:

INDIA - CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
Main Assumptions Used in the Financial Analysis
1.        The main assumptions used in financial projections for all
companies are listed below. Detailed assumptions used in the company
projections can be found in the Project File.
2.        The financial analysis has been carried out in two parts:
(a) The incremental before and after tax financial rate of return of
analysis of each conversion subproject; and
(b)  the projection of financial performance of each company,
including all cement plant operations and non-cement segment
operations, with the proposed conversion investments taking
place.
3.        The main assumptions in the incremental analyses are:
(a) All projections have been carried out in current terms through
1990/91 and in constant terms thereafter.
(b) The levy/non-levy ratio (60% for pre-1982 plants and 40% for
post-1982 investments) would remain in effect until 1989/90. As
the ratio is now based on actual production, it is assumed that
all converted plants would provide 40% of incremental production
as levy cement. From 1990/91 onward full cement decontrol i
assumed and no levy quota would be required.
(c)  Until 1989/90 a minimum of 30% of levy cemenr has been assumed to
be provided as Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC).
(d)  Production build-up after conversion has been estimated at 70% of
capacity in the first year, 80% in the second year, 90% in the
third year and 90% from the fourth year onward (with only minor
variations - i.e. 65Z, 75% and 85% for Mandhar).
(e) No real increases have been assumed to the levy price of
Rs 379/ton (OPC) and Rs 364/ton (PPC) whi.ch was effective as of
June 1985.  Non-levy prices vary between plants as shown in
para 5. The non-levy price has been maintained at existing
levels of between Rs 795 (in the Southern plants) and Rs 575 (in
the Northern plants) until 1989/90. No real increases have been
assumed for these non-levy prices either. From 1990/91 under the
assumption of full cement decontrol, all prices (at plant level,
not including packing charges) have been maintained at Rs 600 per
ton, except as shown in para 5.



ANNEX 6-1
-124-                           Page 2
(f)  Production costs are based on a detailed evaluation of new
material, labor, coal, power and overhead costs provided by
individual companies for their existing pl8nts and planned new
facilities. Operating costs are assumed to escalate at the same
rate as revenues; coal prices have been estimated to increase by
2.5% a year in real terms. Annex 6-2 shows the details by plant
before and after conversion.
(g) The post-tax return is calculated following an analysis of the
possible tax savings arising from spplication of the 25%
investment credit (for investments capitalized by June 30, 1987)
and accelerated depreciation rates (i.e., 15% on declining
balance WDV method basis). Only the tax consequences of the
incremental investment are taken into account (i.e. only the tax
shields available as result of the project are taken into account
to modify the pre-tax stream of benefits). All other investment
consequences are being estimated to occur with and without the
particular conversion project. The post-tax return on equity is
based on incremental net cash flow to equity holders on the
incremental internal cash that is used to finance the incremental
investment stream. All the projects are financed with a high
proportion of debt and the gearing assures equity holders a high
incremental post tax return.
4.        The main assumptions in the financiaL projections of company
performance are:
(a) Projections are carried out in the 'with- Project case in current
terms through 1991/92 when all projects are expected to have
attained steady state operations.
(b) Inflation assumptions are based on the following parameters
consistent with Bank guidelines:
CY86  CY87  CY88  CY89  CY90  CY91  CY92
Foreign Goods & Services  7.0   7.0   7.5   7.7   7.5   4.5   4.5
Local Goods & Serv'tces    7.0   7.5   7.5   7.5   7.5   5.0   5.0
(c) Detailed working capital requirements for cement plant operations
are to be found in the Project File (are shown against individual
company projections).
(d) Interest on new long-term debt taken as follows:
Foreign Currency Portion of IBRD Loan         - 14.0%
Rupee Portion of IBRD Loan                    - 14.0%
Other Loans (weighted average)                - 14.0%
Debenture issues                              - 15.0%
Short Term Loans (Bank overdraft facilities) - 17.5%

Repayment of loans in maximum of 14 semi-annual installment
starting no more than 2 years after plant commissioning.
(e) No asset revaluations have been assumed to take place.
