EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Bank's involvement in the cement sub-sector of India began in 1979/80 with the issue of a
report on the sub-sector. A heavy regulatory regime was prevailing, inhibiting private sector investments
and causing cement shortages. The Bank first appraised an expansion project in the public sector, but
lack of agreement on the policy issues resulted in the project being dropped. In 1982, the Government
announced partial deregulation measures. The consensus in the industry was that decontrol should be
done in a gradual manner, and in recognition of the new policy initiatives of the Government, the Project
under review was appraised in late 1983, reappraised in May 1985 and approved by the Board in March
1986. The project was designed to benefit primarily the private sector cement plants.
Project Objectives
2.    The proposed project was to build on the successful dialogue between GOI and the Bank on
cement subsector strategy and policy and support broadly the GOI thrust of liberalization of key
productive subsectors. It was also to enable the cement industry to modernize its facilities, reduce
operating costs, meet acceptable environmental standards, train operating personnel and generally improve
its competitiveness in preparation for the intended policy of decontrol of pricing and output by the end of
1989/90. These objectives were well conceived and successfully achieved, ushering in a competitive
market economy.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The cement industry was decontrolled from March 1989. As a result, cement capacity increased
from 29 million tons in 1981-82 to 69 million tons in 1993-94.
4.    Under the project, one component covered six specified private sector and one public sector
cement plant for conversion from the inefficient wet process technology to the modern dry process,
precalcinator technology. With later substitutions for three of the originally selected plants,2 withdrawn
by their project sponsors, finally, six dry process plants have been commissioned. In one public sector
plant (different from the originally selected plant), the dry process unit is expected to be commissioned by
March 1995. These conversions have led to cost savings in coal and electricity beyond appraisal
estimates, production of increased quantity and better quality cement and limiting of particulate emissions
well below the maximum prescribed under Government's environmental regulations.
2/    ACC Shahabad, Shree Digjave Cement and CCI Mandhar were withdrawan.



- iii -
5.     Amendments to Loan Agreement No. 2660-IN facilitated the substitutions as mentioned above,
and inclusion of three subprojects for rehabilitation and improvement of energy efficiency in existing
plants. Loan Agreement No. 2661-IN had provided a credit line to ICICI for small-scale rehabilitation
and modernization investments for improving energy efficiency, productivity and meeting environmental
standards. Twenty subprojects were successfully implemented under this line, and their stated objectives
were achieved.
6.     The training component under Ln. 2660-IN was directly implemented by GOI effectively. Under
this component a comprehensive manpower development study was made by an international consultant.
The recommendations made in the study led to the setting up of four regional training centers, specially
tailored to the requirements of individual plants within the region; and, they provided effective training
and earned deep appreciation of the industry.
Project Sustainability
7.     Prospects for project sustainability are very favorable. Substantial reduction in operating costs
has been achieved in the subprojects as commissioned. Cement productivity and production have also
gone up with quality improvements. On the demand side, India's per capita consumption of cement is
low and is expected to double within a decade. With the increased capacity and improvement in cement
quality, India has started exporting cement mainly to neighboring countries and expects to increase it
further.
Project Cost. Financing. Time Schedules
8.     Project Costs under Loan 2660-IN (US$165 million) were estimated at US$365 million during
appraisal, and the actual costs are at US$350 million. The savings in costs are primarily due to change in
Indian Rupee/US$ Dollar parity as well as due to restructured portfolio under this line of credit.
Implementation delays of about two years behind original estimates occurred, partly due to some
subprojects having had to be substituted as explained in para 4 and partly because of the slower learning
curve of the private sector entities of ICB procurement procedures, delayed delivery of equipment and
constraints from governmental regulations while they lasted.
9.     Loan 2661-IN (US$ 35 million) was provided to ICICI as a credit line to support operational
improvement of small subprojects. ICICI provided subloans, which were substantially utilized to improve
the efficiency of twenty subprojects. The closing date for both loans was extended from June 30, 1992 to
June 30, 1994 to enable effective project implementation. Under Ln. 2660-IN, out of US$165 million
loan, US$161.4 million were disbursed and balance of US$3.6 million were cancelled. lInder Ln. 2661-
IN, out of US$35 million, US$34.5 million were disbursed and US$0.5 million cancelled).
Major Factors Affecting Achievement
10.   Two of the participating companies, IDCOL Cement Ltd., in the public sector and Kalyanpur
Cement Ltd., in the private sector, have faced capital structure problems. The equity base of IDCOL
Cement has been strengthened as an outcome of a dialogue between the Orissa State Government and
Bank staff and strong support of the Ministry of Industry (MOI). The problems of Kalyanpur Cement
Ltd. have been highlighted to GOI and a resolution thereof through the good offices of GOI is awaited.
IDCOL, which is the only company which has not yet commissioned its conversion project, has also had
some institutional problems, particularly, due to not taking timely action for training of personnel in the



- iv -
skills needed for the dry process technology. With Bank staff's intervention, necessary arrangements for
training have since been made.
11.   Inspite of the fact that a most modern plant has been installed at Kalyanpur, the financial
situation of this company is highly unsatisfactory. It has been highlighted by the Bank to GOI.
IDBI/ICICI are currently working on proposals for financial restructuring of this company in order to
strengthen its performance.
Bank and Borrower Performance
12.    The performance of the Bank and the Borrower is considered "highly satisfactory" in view of the
complete fulfillment of the several objectives. The cooperation among the multiple agencies involved,
namely the Bank, GOI and the concerned State Governments, IDBI/ICICI and several beneficiary cement
companies (mostly wholly in the private sector) was exemplary. The encouraging experience with this
project, even in the early stages, led to a follow-on project , "Cement Industry Restructuring Project",
approved by the Board on May 15, 1990 which is currently being implemented.
Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons
(i)    Commitment to a project by the Government and its continuing support in the
implementation has proven to be an essential factor contributing to the success of the
project.
(ii)   A well-designed program for policy reforms and incentives for investment led to major
capacity increases by the private sector, and the establishment of a freely functioning
market.
(iii)   Regular supervision by Bank staff contributed towards timely resolution of the problems.
(iv)   Finally, in a project with broad objectives for developing an industry, the participation of
financial intermediaries, like IDBI/ICICI, has been of crucial importance. Their
interaction with the Bank has been helpful in developing a better perspective for
IDBI/ICICI staff on modern technology, environmental and other issues addressed in the
beneficiary sub-projects.
(v)    The project has demonstrated that, if one or two subprojects are appraised by Bank staff,
these can serve as a model for the financial intermediaries to appraise other subprojects
thus achieving the institution-building objectives of the Bank. The private sector, which
initially was skeptical of the Bank's participation, has acknowledged that it has learnt
significantly in technical, financial, procurement, institutional and environmental aspects;
and it would appreciate catalytic role of the Bank in future projects.
(vi)   During the ICR mission, future operating plans were prepared by the participating project
sponsors and agreed with IDBI/ICICI and the Bank. These plans highlight the future
performance of these companies. Financial restructuring plans for IDCOL and Kalyanpur
cement are currently under review by IDBI/ICICI.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDIA
CEMENT INDUSTRY PORJECT
(Loan 2660/2661-IN)
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.    The Bank became interested in the cement subsector in India in 1979. It issued a Cement Sub-
sector Report in 1980. This report highlighted that a heavy regulatory regime (comprising licensing of
plant capacities, price control, freight equalization, distribution quotas etc.), had discouraged the private
sector from investing in the sub-sector and the country had suffered through years of cement shortages.
GOI accepted the findings of the subsector report. It was agreed that the Bank would consider a capacity
expansion project of the Cement Corporation of India (CCI) in the public sector with the objective of
achieving possible liberalization of the controls. However, following appraisal of the proposed project, the
dialogue with the Government of India (GOI), did not progress to the satisfaction of the Bank and the
pursuit of the project was given up just prior to negotiations. In early 1982, GOI announced partial
decontrol measures, and subsequently the Cement Industry Project, which was to assist the private sector
primarily, was conceived so as to provide much needed foreign exchange to the industry and to substitute
polluting and energy-wasting wet-process units by efficient dry-process units. This project was first
appraised in late 1983, but a reappraisal for various reasons (explained in para 4) had to be done in May
1985. The Project has been implemented successfully. It has been followed by the Cement Industry
Restructuring Project (Ln. 3196-IN), approved by the Bank in May 1990, and is currently under
implementation.
2.    Indian cement industry capacity increased from 29 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in 1981-82
to 69 MTPA by the end of 1993. The concept of modernization by process conversion and adoption of
the state of the art technology as applied under this loan, resulted in significant increases in productivity,
and profitability, and acted as a catalyst for the private sector for further investments in the industry. At
the same time, the Indian cement industry has established international contacts, and has become fully
aware of new developments in cement manufacturing technology. With the liberalized economic policies
and financial reforms, many of the Indian cement companies who have benefited from the Bank loans,
have accessed international capital markets and raised funds by Euro equity issues/bonds for
expanding/modernizing their plants.
B. Statement/Evaluation of Obiectives
3.    The main objective of the project was rapid development and improving operational efficiency of
the cement industry with a view to support GOI policy of liberalization and decontrol. The second
objective was to convert to modern dry process technology in seven identified cement plants and
selectively upgrade a number of other units to attain of higher energy efficiency and improved pollution
control. In 1985, only 42% of the industry was based on outdated inefficient wet process characterized
by heavy consumption of coal. The high consumption rate of Indian coal with its high ash content
seriously affected the kiln capacity utilization and cement quality. A third objective was to upgrade skills
of cement plant personnel through training to enable them to run modern plants efficiently.



- 2 -
4.     Looking back, it is clear that these were the right objectives and that the problems of the industry
had been well understood when the project was identified and prepared. According to Bank procedures,
the major beneficiary units - (seven projects were chosen at that time under Loan 2660-IN) - were
individually appraised, and much time was required. Later three of the seven units dropped out after the
loan became effective, two decided to defer conversion to the dry process and the third unit dropped out
because of change in ownership. Amendment to the Loan Agreement became necessary and the scope of
the Project had to be broadened in August 1988 (24 months after Board approval) with consequent delay
in the loan closing date, to provide for inclusion of "such other companies as shall be agreed upon
between the Bank and ICICI or IDBI to be participating entities" that could acquire "equipment and
spares for conversion of their plants with a view to improving operating efficiency, environmental
controls, product quality, labor productivity and marketing and distribution systems". Five subprojects
were substituted for the three subprojects which were withdrawan by project sponsors. These events
suggest that, with well defined project criteria, one or two units only need to be appraised in depth (to
serve as models) and latitude then left for other units to be subsequently added. If financial intermediaries
and cofinanciers are involved, such as IDBI and ICICI in this project, they may be encouraged to
carryout appraisals of other units later under the Bank's supervision, do the ground work and provide all
data and other information to the Bank for review of the appraisals.
C. Achievement of Objectives
Macroeconomic and Sector Policies
5.     The rapid development of the Indian cement industry during the nine years since the project
appraisal has proven that the chosen strategy and objectives have produced the desired results.
Deregulation was carried out in phases and completed by GOI by March 1989. The annual cement
capacity has increased from 29 million tons in 1981-82 to 69 million tons in 1992-93. The dry-process
operation as a percentage of the total capacity has increased from 42% in 1985 to 84% in 1992-93. The
market has become competitive, supply exceeds demand slightly, and India has commenced to export
some cement.
Physical Obiectives and Attainment in the Sub-Projects
6.     The implementation completion mission's aide-memoire dated July 22, 1994, attached as Annex 1
together with the "Operating Plan" attached to it, gives details of the status of the nine major sub-projects
and the operating targets achieved and to be achieved. As of October 1994, only one of the nine major
sub-projects, i.e. IDCOL Cement Ltd., remains to be physically completed and commissioned (expected
in March 1995). In all cases, the targets of savings in coal and power consumption and increases in
clinker/cement production have been achieved or would be achieved in the projects under completion.
Atmospheric emissions have been or would be reduced well below the norms prescribed by the
government. In respect of the twenty small sub-projects under Loan 2661 IN, the set objectives have
similarly been achieved. Objectives to be attained had been well defined in the SAR, and later applied in
the appraisals carried out by IDBI/ICICI (and reviewed by the Bank) in sub-projects selected subsequent
to Board approval. Timely action by GOI, IDBI, ICICI and the Bank in modifying the project scope in
the substituted projects (para 4) contributed in achieving the project objectives over a broadened horizon
than anticipated in the SAR.



-3-
Financial Objectives
7.     The Project had the specified targets for the original seven sub-projects selected for Bank support
under Ln. 2660-IN in the areas of: reduction in cost of productionlton of cement, and acceptable financial
and economic rates of return on an incremental basis. Individual financial objectives were not prescribed
for the small sub-projects under Ln. 2661-IN, and had also not been identified at appraisal.
8.     For the four large plants which were appraised in the SAR and were converted to the dry process,
about 23 percent reduction in manufacturing cost per ton of cement on average was achieved. The
savings in "Cost of Sales" (See Section II1, Table 9A) indicated that in all cases, the savings have
exceeded SAR estimates. The FRRs and ERRs, as estimated for the nine subprojects under Ln. 2660-IN,
range from 16% to 28% and hence are satisfactory. (See Section III - Tables 9B & 9C). In some cases,
e.g. the current FRR and ERR estimates, although satisfactory, are lower than appraisal estimates (Table
9B and C, Section III), e.g. for KCP, FRR is estimated at 20.9% compared with SAR estimate of 37.3%.
It is explained by the fact that appraisal estimates were made on the assumption of constant exchange rate
of US$1 =Rs. 13.0 during the period 1986-94. However, the exchange rate increased to US$1 =Rs 31 in
a series of uneven steps which affected the costs of sub-projects unevenly, depending upon the respective
implementation schedules of the sub-projects. It is to be added that the rates of return for the IDCOL
subproject which is to be commissioned in March 1995 only, and for the Kalyanpur cement project may
require revisions since the former is not completed and the latter has financial problems to be resolved.
Social Obiectives
9.     The Project was prepared in 1985 at which time poverty alleviation and gender concerns were not
explicitly addressed. Nevertheless, since cement plants are situated in remote areas of the country in
proximity to deposits of limestone, the growth of the industry has triggered improvement in the economy
in those areas. The owners have provided for the welfare of the employees and their families by
providing health care facilities, educational institutions and supporting women's welfare associations,
setting up of family camps and promoting educational and employment opportunities for women.
Environment
10.    Pollution Control Boards in India have specified a maximum of 150 mg/NM3 for atmospheric
emissions in protected areas and 250 mg/NM3 in non-protected areas. Bank financed subprojects required
all beneficiary plants to control pollution in the stacks and material transfer points through use of
electrostatic precipitators, high efficiency separators, cassette filters, bag filters and bag dust collectors, as
necessary. The plants regularly monitor stack gases and ambient air quality. Actual emission levels
achieved are better than the regulations (all less than 150mg/NM3, some in the 75-100 mg/NM3 range).
11.    All participating cement plants have developed green belts by planting trees. One company, for
example, is in the process of planting over 240,000 trees in an area of 600 acres. Tree planting is also
part of the governrnent's scheme for replacing trees equivalent to those lost in mining lease granted in
forest areas.
12.    Most State Governments have introduced regulations for cement plants to submit annual
environmental impact statements, reporting on levels of pollutants discharged in water and air, also on
disposal of hazardous and solid wastes. The SAR for Ln. 3196-IN took note of these regulations and
incorporated standards acceptable to the Bank.



-4-
Institutional Development
13.    An aspect of development which has been of commnon benefit to the industry has been the
establishment of four regional training centers (RTCs) for providing pre-entry, entry and refresher
courses, as well as special courses tailored to the needs of individual plants from time to time. A
component of Loan 2660-IN was a study on training needs which was undertaken by a well known
consultant. The study correctly identified the unique structure of the Indian Cement Industry and its
particular needs for training, including both skills and manpower requirements. The study outlined
recommendations for a comprehensive training program based on the creation of 4-6 regional, demand
driven training centers, with emphasis on 'training of trainers'. The study met with good response from
the industry. The recommendations of the consultant were discussed and developed further between the
Bank supervision missions and the Development Commissioner of the Cement Industry and implemented
with the latter's enthusiastic support.
D. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
14.    Appraisal reports by the Bank of the original sub-projects for conversion, as well as appraisal
reports by IDBI/ICICI of the major sub-projects selected later had assessed project implementation time
ranging from 24 to 39 months. But the actual project implementation time ranged between 41 and 51
months. Excluding two of the major sub-projects involved (IDCOL and Kalyanpur which are discussed in
the succeeding paragraphs), the most common reasons for the delays were: (i) Private Sector sub-
borrowers took more time than anticipated to become familiar with ICB procedures; (ii) GOI regulations
(since abolished) for issuing licenses for capacity increases and approvals to import and engage
consultants took unduly long time; and (iii) unexpected delays occurred in many cases of foreign suppliers
delivering equipment and materials. In regard to project costs, the total costs for the nine major sub-
projects (the appraised estimate versus the actual) show decrease in US$ terms, from $365 million to
$350 million. This is a result of the exchange rate changes from $1 =Rs. 13 in 1985/86 to the currently
prevailing $1 =Rs .31.
15.    Two project sponsors (IDCOL and Kalyanpur) which are converting to the dry process under
Loan 2660-IN needed financial restructuring. Originally, Hira Cement Works was a division of Industrial
Development Corporation of Orissa (IDCOL), a Government of Orissa Company. IDCOL had financial
problems which until early 1993 affected implementation of HIRA Cement project. Bank missions
reconmmended to the Government of Orissa to establish Hira Cement Works as an autonomous subsidiary
company, with infusion of sufficient new equity. It was accepted by the State Government. IDCOL
Cement Ltd., was accordingly formed on March 31, 1993, and the Unit Trust of India subscribed to 40%
of its equity (Rs.350 million) in January 1994. IDCOL Cement Ltd has now overcome the financial
problems. However, its management has to adjust to its new status as an independent company to be run
purely on commercial lines. The company has urgent training needs to equip itself for running the new
dry-process plant. After extensive dialogues with Bank supervision missions, IDCOL has recently
finalized training arrangements including on-the-job training by experts during the commissioning of the
plant, expected in March 1995.
16.    Kalyanpur Cement Ltd., was a 'sick' unit when the Bank approved ICICI/IDBI's
recommendations in April 1990 to make it a beneficiary under Loan 2660 IN and allocated $27 million of
the loan proceeds. At that time, the company's share capital of Rs. 18.75 million had been wiped out by
carry-forward losses of Rs.52.4 million.The term debt amounted to Rs.400 millions. It was anticipated
that the conversion to dry-process with an increase in capacity from 0.4 million TPY to one million TPY



would significantly improve its financial performance while meeting a substantial share of the demand in
cement deficit areas of Bihar, Bengal and Nepal. GOI had also supported this project through grants
from a Cement Development Fund which was to be created for the cement industry, and the Government
of Bihar had proposed certain sales tax benefits. However, these measures did not materialize.  IDBI
and ICICI recommnended assisting the company and provided Rs.321 million (equivalent to $20 million at
the time). The Bank agreed with IDBI/ICICI and approved the sub-loan. In doing so, the Bank implicitly
accorded exemptions with respect to these sub-projects to the financial covenants with IDBIIICICI
regarding current ratio (1.2:1), debt/equity ratio (67:33) and debt service coverage (1.2).
17.   Kalyanpur continued to be beset with financial problems, mainly due to implementation delays
and the adverse impact of Rupee/US$Dollar parity. IDBI/ICICI are working out financial restructuring
plans with Kalyanpur management. The converted plant was commissioned in August 1994, about nine
months behind the original schedule. A logistical problem which also requires urgent resolution is the
improvement of the 25 km road which leads to the rail head and highways. This road is a bottleneck
which impedes truck movement and affects cement production. GOI's pointed attention has been drawn to
this problem.
18.    On hind-sight, the Bank should have insisted upon financial restructuring as a precondition for
approving these subloans for Kalyanpur and IDCOL projects.
E. Proiect Sustainabilit
19.   Technically, renovation and modernization have bestowed a new life on every plant covered by a
sub-project. While the project focussed on replacement of the kiln and upgrading of the other plant
process areas to assure sustained plant operation at new rated capacities, many of the participating
companies have since carried the renovation and modernization further by replacing/ adding cement mills
and other auxiliaries. Table 6 (Part II) shows that targets for reduction in coal and power consumption
and costs of production have already been achieved by some of the plants in their first years of operation
after conversion; the others would achieve these economies soon. The commercial outlook, however, in
a free market is not entirely predictable on a year to year basis, though the long term promises to be
favorable. The industry, based on historic increases in demand, had expected 1992-93 to be a boom year
for demand, but demand stagnated; however, 1993-94 recorded a 6% growth, with exports of 2.8 million
tons inclusive of clinker. Capacity utilization for this year was 86%.
F. Bank Performance
20.   The Bank performance was very satisfactory in identification, preparation, appraisal and
supervision. At the identification stage, the Bank correctly diagnosed what was ailing the industry and
identified the need to import the latest technology, the need to dismantle government controls etc.. With
the Government willing to provide industry incentives on a phased basis, the Bank organized the
preparation of a large number of sub-projects. The appraisal dealt with technical, financial, economic,
environmental and training aspects. Concurrently, the Bank maintained a lively dialogue with the
Governmnent on policy strategies. An important aspect of the appraisal exercise was participation by
IDBI/ICICI representatives, giving them exposure to the Bank's appraisal procedures. When some of the
original sub-projects had to be dropped later, the appraisal of substitute sub-projects was carried out
effectively by IDBI/ICICI. The IDBI/ICICI appraisal reports were reviewed and cleared by the Bank, and
the funds were reallocated for these sub-projects. All supervision missions included representatives from
IDBI/ICICI. During these missions, Bank staff tended to concentrate on ICB procurement (financed by



-6 -
the Bank) and technical and physical progress, with IDBI/ICICI staff furnishing the supplementary inputs.
21.   The Bank mounted supervision missions twice a year, during the early years (a task manager cum
financial analyst, a cement expert and a procurement specialist) and two members in the years since 1991
(a task manager cum procurement specialist and a cement expert). The cement expertise has come from
the same individual in all the years, from identification to ICR; the present procurement specialist was
associated with the project for four years continuously. Their contribution was appreciated by the
borrower and the cement companies as reflected in the views expressed in the aide-memoire (paras 7.3 &
7.4 at Annex 1).
G. Borrower Performance
22.    Various agencies, i.e. GOI, IDBI, ICICI and the subproject sponsors were fully committed to
successful implementation of all the sub-projects and, their performance was highly satisfactory.
IDBI/ICICI, along with the Bank, instituted monitoring and reporting procedures by sub-borrowers.
However, later on, GOI gradually removed all controls and regulations on the cement industry but its
officers in the Ministries of Finance and Industry were always keen to exchange views and comments
with Bank supervision mission and to remove obstacles. IDBI/ICICI maintained a cordial working
relationship with all the cement companies and assisted them in processing their disbursement requests
expeditiously. In the initial years (1980-89), project progress was slow due to delay in processing of ICB
procurement documents and obtaining clearances/licenses from the government agencies. The participating
cement companies, by and large, managed the implementation with due speed and efficiency, except when
faced with local problems (e.g. IDCOL's problem of finding local cost financing). Consultants and
contractors were generally competent. The study and training aspects, as discussed in para 13, were
implemented under the direction of the Ministry of Industry (MOI).
H. Assessment of Outcome
23.   In the sub-projects covered by Loan 2660 IN, the main performance indicators, are coal
consumption, power consumption, clinker and cement output (capacity utilization) and pollution control.
Agreements were reached with the beneficiary cement companies on the performance parameters to be
maintained. These parameters were met and in some cases exceeded. (The details are given in Annex 2
of the mission aide memoire under "Operating Plan").
24.   The project outcome is rated as 'highly satisfactory'. The objectives of modernization, cost
reduction, energy saving, environmental improvements and increases in output of clinker and cement have
largely been fulfilled. The implied objective of a free market for cement has also been achieved. Financial
and economic rates of return, on present estimates, are seen to be about 20% for the project as a whole.
25.    The Bank loan acted as a catalyst for industry-wide investment in modern technology, and the
capacity which was 29 MTPA in 1981-82 increased to 69 MTPA in 1992-93. It was also instrumental in
turning the county from a cement shortage to cement surplus status by 1992-93, when it exported nearly
three million tonnes of cement/clinker. Some companies have obtained ISO-900 certification for quality
assurance and are setting up export oriented units. The Indian cement industry has become internationally
competitive.

I. Future Operations
26.    The Bank has an ongoing role in the Indian cement industry through Loan 3196-IN, in which the
objective is cement capacity expansion in the deficit regions and the strengthening of four regional
training centers and introduction of bulk cement transport technology through a pilot project. Bank
missions which supervise that project would continue to monitor performance of the two cement plants
involved under Loan 2660-IN; Kalyanpur Cement, and IDCOL Cement (which remained to be
commissioned during the visit of the Bank's ICR mission in July 1994). Future investments in the cement
subsector are planned to be met entirely by the private sector. However, GOI initiatives and support
would be required by investors in the areas of innovative technology, infrastructure improvements and
energy conservation.
J. Key Lessons Learned
27.    This project has demonstrated that:
(a)    commitment to a project by the Governrment and its continuing engagement in the
implementation is an essential requirement for success.
(b)    policy reforms to free the market for production and trading are highly rewarding.
(c)    IBRD could assist in developing the private sector using the right instruments.
(d)    In a project with broad objectives to develop an industry as such, all sub-projects do not
have to be appraised in depth at the SAR stage. Detailed criteria should, however, be
formulated and only selected sub-projects need initially be appraised. Appraisal of other
sub-projects should be undertaken as they are identified, within a stated period of time
after loan approval. Where financial intermediaries are participating, subsequent appraisals
could be done by them with the Bank reviewing the reports and ensuring that the
appraisals conform to the Bank standards.
(e)    Financial restructuring of the beneficiary entities should be taken up-front prior to
approving the financing of their investments.
(f)    Supervision by Bank missions must be regular and comprehensive. Trouble shooting, as
in the case of IDCOL Cement, naturally falls in the domain of the Bank; traditionally
Bank missions have focussed on identifying problems and proposing remedies, which
underlines the importance of regular supervision. It is important to include
representatives of cofinanciers/financial intermediaries at appraisal and supervision of the
projects.

Aide Memoire
INDIA CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECTS
SUPERVISION MISSION
JUNE-JULY 1994
1.     A World Bank Mission comprising Messrs Uruj Kirmani (Mission Leader),
Mogens Fog and P. Venugopal (Consultants) visited India from June 22, through
July 22, 1994 :
(a)   To  review  the  progress  under  Ln  3196  IN-  Cement  Industry
Restructuring Project.
(b) - To prepare   Project/Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on
closing of Loans 2660 and 2661-IN on June 30, 1994.
2.    The aide memoire consists of two parts.  Part A reviews the progress under
Ln 3196-IN and other issues. Part B highlights the Mission's findings on the
projects under Lns 2660/2661-IN, which will later be reflected in the ICR.   The
findings of the Mission, the agreements reached and recommendations made are
summarized in Parts A and B as described above. A formal communication will be
sent from Washington DC  to confirm   or amend  the  Mission's  findings  as
appropriate.
3.    The Mission takes this opportunity to express  its gratitude for the
excellent cooperation and constructive discussions held with the officials of
Department of Economic Affairs  (DEA)  in the   Ministry of Finance  (MOF),
Department of Industrial Development in the Ministry of Industry (MOI),
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India (ICICI), Orissa State Government Officials and Hon'ble Chief
Minister of Orissa, Mr. Biju Patnaik and executives of sub-project entities. A
list of officials met is given in Annex - 1.
4.    The Mission visited  ACC  (Gagal)  and  Gujarat  Ambuja projects  under
implementation in Himachal Pradesh,  IDCOL   Cement Limited  (ICL) at Bargarh
Orissa,  India Cement - Sankernagar (Tamil Nadu)  and KCP Macherla in Andhra
Pradesh and Regional Training Center at Dalmiapuram (Tamil Nadu) and reviewed the
project activities with the field staff.
s.    Ln 2660-IN (Loan amount US S 165 million),
Ln 2661-IN (Loan amount US $ 35 million)
The original loan closing date June 30, 1992 was extended twice to enable
the projects under implementation to be completed. These loans have been closed
on June 30, 1994. As on June 30, 1994 an amount of US$ 151.8 million has been
disbursed  under Ln 2660-IN and US $ 31.8 million under Ln 2661-IN.  Further
disbursements from the loan will be made for withdrawal applications received at
the Bank Headquarters or at its New Delhi office by close of business on October
31, 1994 in respect of eligible expenditure incurred on or before the closing
date (i.e. Payments made for goods, work and services which have been Drovided
prior to the closing date).   IDBI and ICICI are now working on the final
withdrawal applications for disbursement of the remaining amounts.

PART B
7.    CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT (LOANS 2660 IN & 2661 IN)
7.1   The project was approved by the Bank Board on March 20, 1986 and the loans
(borrower GOI for one loan of $165 million with onlending of $163.5 million
equivalent to IDBI and ICICI in equal proportions l, and ICICI for the other loan
of $35 million) became effective on November 10, 1986. The initial loan closing
date was June 30, 1992, but two extensions of one year each became necessary. The
loans were finally closed on June 30, 1994 with disbursements as follows- $151
million as of June 30, 1994 under Loan 2660 IN, however with most of the balance
of the loan expected to be drawn down during the grace period of 120 days; and
$31.8 as of June 30, 1994 under Loan 2661 IN, however with the balance of the
loan expected to be drawn down similarly.
7.2   With the enthusiastic cooperation extended to the mission by GOI, IDBI,
ICICI and 'the participating companies (ACC, India Cement, Birla Jute, KCP,
Kalyanpur Cement and IDCOL among others), the mission decided to initiate
processes for preparing an "Implementation Completion Report" (ICR- OP 13.55 of
April 1994) in preference to proceeding to prepare a "Project Completion Report"
in terms of the guidelines of June 7, 1989. Accordingly, this aide-memoire first
presents the views of IDBI/ICICI (both as cofinanciers and as virtual borrowers
in terms of the Project Agreement of July 22, 1986) , the participating companies
and the mission itself on the implementation of the project and its operation.
7.3   In reverse order,  the record of views  starts with the participating
companies. Nine sub-projects under Loan 2660 IN were involved, in general with
modernization of the cement plants and introduction of state of art dry process
in place of the out moded wet process/ older dry process. The cement industry in
1985 was controlled by GOI in many respects, prices, distribution, licenses,
foreign exchange releases etc. Demand was far in excess of supply, yet the
industry was not growing. The Bank stepped in at a critical juncture with a
number of goals to be achieved. The dry process to be adopted would result in
higher production of cement, it would save substantially on coal and power
consumption, allow more consumption of lower grade limestone, improve quality of
cement and almost eliminate pollution. All these results have been achieved/are
in the process of being achieved. Cost of production was reduced/would be
reduced, not only as a consequence of the superior technology adopted, but also
due to the governmental exemptions from duties when IBRD loans are availed of,
as well as in the government bearing the foreign exchange risks. Steps taken by
the government to deregulate partially, then fully in March 1989, also delicense
the industry in July 1991, under the Bank's active encouragement, have had
salutary  effects  on  cement production,  even  exports  having  begun.  The
participating companies thus believe that the first "line of credit" (loans 2660
IN and 2661 IN) was a watershed in the history of the cement industry '. Loan
2661 IN assisted 20 small projects to rehabilitate and bring about technical
improvements.
1 GOI retained $1.5 million for direct technical assistance to the Cement
sector.
2 The views recorded here were universal, but were given more articulate
expression by Mr.N.Srinivasan. MD India Cement also the President of the Cement
Manufacturers' Association and the Chairman of the Development Council for Cement
Industry.

7.4   IDBI/ICICI fully endorse the views of the participating companies. When the
project was prepared in 1985, loan 2660 IN was intended to cover seven sub-
projects, all for conversion from wet to dry process. As it happened, four out
of the original seven became beneficiaries under the loan with the other three
being dropped. ACC sold off the Shahabad unit, while CCI Mandhar and SDC had
financial constraints. The scope of the project was broadened in August 1988 and
following that five new sub-projects were appraised and selected for IBRD cum
IDBI/ICICI financing. The later induction of these sub-projects required that the
loan closing date be extended by two years. Although the loan has closed on June
30, 1994 and disbursements (to the participating companies) effected, two sub-
projects remain to be physically completed; Kalyanpur Cement Ltd., (entrant in
April 1990) would be commissioning the converted plant in August 1994, with IDCOL
(entrant in February 1990) expected to do so in March 1995. All objectives have
been or would be met and the project benefits would be sustained over the full
life of the plants.
7.5   The mission considers the project a success in the direct and indirect
impact it has had on the economy of the country and the environment. Cement
capacity reached 71.19 million tons in December 1993 and production in 1993 was
56 million tons. India now ranks fifth among the cement producing countries after
China, Russia, Japan and USA. Dry process capacity which was 51 in 1982 of the
total rose to 83% in 1993. The Mission was gratified to see during its plant
visits how much pollution had been cut down and particulate emissions brought
below the norm of 150 mg/Nm3.
7.6   An operation plan was evolved during discussions with the companies
concerned. Annex 3 outlines the brief understanding of the mission on the plan.
7.7   The mission also provided advice and support to the borrower for preparing
its own contribution to the ICR. IDBI and ICICI have already initiated action to
prepare the evaluation report and will complete it in about two months.
8.    Further to the above observations, the mission has the following additional
comments on some sub-projects.
8.1   Kalyanpur Cement Ltd. (KCL)   The company  continues  to be beset with
financial problems. It was a "sick" company in 1990 when Bank authorization was
given for onlending by IDBI/ICICI of $27 million under LN.2660 IN, on the basis
of a comprehensive financing plan for the sub-project. The project cost at that
time was placed at Rs. 720 million (but then under revision to Rs.950 million).
The estimate now stands at Rs.1906 million mainly due to delays in supply of
imported machinery and equipment, meanwhile the dollar/rupee exchange rate having
changed considerably and interest on outstanding loans having accumulated. The
critical issue presently is that the company is short of cash and its financial
ratios are unsatisfactory. It has a capital restructuring plan (raising more
equity) which it has placed before IFCI (letter dated May 30, 1994), which may
help it to tide over the problem. This plan calls for immediate attention by
ICICI/IDBI/IFCI. ICICI/IDBI should keep in view the financial covenants which
they had undertaken to enforce on the participating companies, which Kalyanpur
Cement Ltd. has not been complying with. The mission appreciates that the
company,s financial position will change dramatically when the dry process plant



3 3   _
is commissioned and the additionally produced cement (150% increase in capacity)
is marketed, but the effect of this change on the finances of the company will
come after a time lag. It is the interim position which has to be handled
adequately and effectively. On project implementation, KCL's association with
Holderbank (equity participation in KCL, technical assistance etc.) has been of
considerable help. Nevertheless, the carefully planned project implementation has
been affected by delays in delivery of equipment and unforeseen soil conditions.
The kiln was lighted in February 1994, but due to a number of teething problems,
commercial production is likely to commence from August 1994 only.
8.2   IDCOL Cement Ltd. IDCOL had financial problems too and was not in a
position to bring in its contribution to meet the local cost financing. As
suggested by an earlier supervision mission, a  solution was found in first
setting up a new company IDCOL Cement Ltd., (in place of Hira Cement Works, a
division of IDCOL), with effect from March 31, 1993 and second by raising its
share capital, with 40t of the equity (equal to Rs.350 million) being subscribed
by the Unit Trust of India in January 1994, and the balance 60% being retained
by IDCOL. The present problems of IDCOL relate to time slippages in
implementation of the project. As of now, mechanical completion is about 65%
complete, electrical about 40-45%, and control system installation about 10-15a.
Commissioning may not be expected earlier than March 1995. Project management
requires tightening up and monitoring closely on critical activities through
PERT/CPM charts and aids. A matter of urgent concern is training of key operators
for the new processes. Steps being taken by IDCOL with the advice given by the
mission, supplementing such other arrangements it had made earlier, have been
outlined in para 6.10.3 of Part A.
8.3 Technical Assistance (TA).  GOI retained $1.5 million of the loan amount
under 2660 IN to provide technical assistance to the cement sub-sector (Part D
of Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement of July 22, 1986) . Study by consultants
(Holderbank) seems to have cost $642,324.60 which amount was released by GOI to
ICICI who had administered the contract with the consultants. A sum of $0.9
million has been allocated to DCCI for organizing the HRD. To this amount a
DANIDA grant of $5.0 million and an amount of $1.5 million from Loan 3196 IN have
been added. While the $0.9 million under Loan 2660 IN has been expended, steps
have been taken only recently for claiming reimbursement from the Bank. It is
necessary that a proper accounting and classification of the amount of $1.5
million allocated to GOI under Loan 2660 IN be taken up by GOI.

OPERATING PLAN
The participating companies under Loan 2660 IN have indicated the following as
their operating plans. (No operating plan for the several mini-projects under
Loan 2661 IN is prepared, nor is it necessary.)
ACC
Madukkarai Unit
Madukkarai expansion to 520,000 tons from 380,000 tons/pa of OPC cement has
been operational from May 1989. The performance achieved against the SAR
estimates has been as follows:
Project estimate         Achieved
Output of kiln                 1500 tons/per day         1600 tons/pd
Heat consumed                  1040 kcal/kg of           959 kcal/kg
clinker
Power                          120 kWh/ton of            103 kWh/ton
cement
The unit plans to maintain the better than estimate performance , as above,
in the coming years.
Madukkarai's production of cement during 1989-94 was as follows:
1989-90     1990-91      1991-92      1992-93     1993-94

Madukkarai would thus maintain an above capacity production in the future
also.
Gacral Modernization & Rehabilitation
This sub-project selected subsequent to loan effectiveness went into
commercial production in March 1993. The parameters as expected to change and as
achieved are as follows:

Mines Modernization and Enerqv Savincqs Scheme
The sub-project, a later inclusion, since completed and executed at a cost
of Rs.412 million (IBRD share being Rs.278 million) has already resulted in
reducing manpower and consumption of stores and spares in nine cement plants
owned by ACC. The pay back period is four years and the benefits achieved are
permanent.

THE K.C.P. LTD.
This sub-project for modernizing the Macherla plant was completed in
December 1989. Cement production in FY89 had been a low 137,749 tons. Following
the commissioning of the modernization scheme and introduction of the new dry
process, production of cement has been continuously increasing and the energy
efficiency parameters registering improvements as follows:

SAR estimates of 0.375 MM tons/pa of cement production have been realized
and will be maintained. SAR estimates of 800 kcal/kg heat use per ton of clinker
(corresponding to coal at 22t), against 1600 kcal/kg in the old plant have been
more than fulfilled and will be maintained for the rest of the plant life. Power
consumption was forecast at 120 kWh/ton of cement, compared to 133/kWh in the old
plant. The present rate of consumption is slightly higher. But a new state-of-
the-art cement mill will be installed within 24 months and that will help to
reduce the power consumption significantly.
The atmospheric and fugitive emissions have been controlled to less than
75 mgm/Nm3 against the statutory norm of 150 mgm/Nm3. This will be maintained.
K.C.P Ltd. has instituted a quality assurance system in conformity with ISO
9002. Lloyds Registered Quality Assurance Ltd. certification is expected in
August 1994.
NDI .CEMENTS LTD.
This sub-project for conversion the Sankarnagar plant from wet to dry
process was commissioned in August 1990. It achieved results as follows:

* The company has ordered a new cement mill which will be operational in
October 1995. The new mill will help to reduce power consumption further.
The company functions in a fierce competitive environment. It recognizes
that its present old fashioned open circuit milling system limits the capability
to attain higher fineness of  cement. Therefore it has decided to install a
modern milling system which will enable it to increase the fineness.

The company expects to maintain and improve on all the parameters in future
operations. In financial terms, the reduction in variable costs has been about
20t as between the earlier wet process and the new dry process, which has made
the operations profitable, a position which will be maintained.

The variable cost reduction has been about 25% as between the wet and the
dry processes. All improvements will be maintained through the plant life. The
plant would have sustained overall losses under the old process, instead of which
it has attained a profitability position as a result of the conversion.
BIRLA CEMENT WORKS & CHITTOR CEMENT WORKS
This sub-project was selected subsequent to loan effectiveness. The plant
was to be modernized by upgrading all two stage pre-heaters to five stage pre-
heaters, also various balancing equipments were to be installed to reduce thermal
energy consumption and to increase production. The sub-project is under
commissioning and commercial production will begin in september 1994.

SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S EVALUATION REPORT
INDIA CEMENT INDUSTRY PROJECT
LOANS 2660-IN/2661-IN
INTRODUCTION
1.    Prior to 1980s, due to inadequate production and supply the Indian Cement Industry
was subject to price and distribution control. With the GOI bringing about policy changes, the
installed capacity grew. However, problems related to high ash coal and poor coal quality
were acute in wet process plants. In consultation with GOI, The World Bank decided to
support the industry by extending two Lines of Credit Ln 2660-IN and Ln 2661-IN for
modernization of wet process plants and expansion of installed capacity in the country.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.    The project was expected to assist the cement industry in India in improving operating
efficiency, environmental controls, product quality, labor productivity and marketing and
distribution systems. Plant conversion subprojects were ACC: Madukkarai, Birla Jute: Satna,
India Cement: Sankarnagar, KCP: Macherla, Kalyanpur Cements and IDCOL Cement. The
modernization subprojects were ACC: Gagal, ACC:Mines modernization, Energy Savings and
Coal Washery (MEC), Birla Jute: Chittorgarh. Both Kalyanpur Cements and IDCOL Cement
and the modemization subprojects were later included to substitute 3 projects earlier included
in the SAR which were withdrawn by project sponsors.
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.    All the subprojects have been satisfactorily completed/expected to be completed. In
view of the late entry of Kalyanpur Cements and IDCOL Cement in the project portfolio, the
implementation period was extended by 2 years necessitating the extension of the closing date
of Bank loans by 2 years.
ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
4.    All the completed projects have achieved and in some cases exceeded the technical and
financial parameters set out at the time of appraisal. The projects under implementation -
IDCOL Cement and Kalyanpur Cements are also expected to achieve their objectives as
estimated. The technical assistance objective has been achieved by completion of study for



- 45 -
assessing manpower training needs. Implementation of this resulted in setting up of four
Regional Training Centers in different parts of the country for imparting training in technical
and managerial skills required in the cement industry. The policy liberalization objectives
have also been achieved as visualized during appraisal. The cement sector is now deregulated
and is now operating under a free market economy.
PERFORMANCE OF BORROWER
5.    Of the total loan of US$ 165 million, GOI channelled US$ 163.5 million through
IDBI/ICICI in equal proportion for onlending to cement projects. An amount of US$ 1.5
million was utilized for training component by GOI. IDBI/ICICI extended all the required
assistance and helped the subborrowers in complying with the various requirements of World
Bank.
PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK
6.    The initiative taken by the World Bank in extending the first line of credit to the
cement sector provided the impetus for quicking the pace of its growth and acted as a catalyst
to the private sector for undertaking modernization program using state-of-art technologies
and in attaining environmental and social objectives.
KEY LESSONS LEARNT
7.    IDBI/ICICI as also the subborrowers were able to develop a broader perspective on the
proven state-of-art technology in the cement sector as well as better knowledge of
environmental policies of the World Bank and pollution control measures and strategies in the
cement industry on a global scale.
Closer co-ordination between the World Bank, GOI, IDBI/ICICI and subborrowers has
resulted in the successful achievement of the objectives.
For performance monitoring, regular interaction and joint supervision with the World
Bank Missions has proved highly productive.

BORROWER'S FINAL EVALUATION REPORT ON INDIA CEMENT
INDUSTRY PROJECT LN. 2660-LN/2661-IN
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1  Indian Cement Industry
The cement industry which had a capacity of 3.8 million tonnes per annum (tpa) in
1950-51 underwent a period of accelerated expansion between 1950-69. The growth of the
industry slowed down during the decade of the 1970s as the regulated industrial environment
and controls on pricing and distribution acted as deterrant. At the start of the 1 980s capacity
utilization in. the industry was poor mainly due to power shortage and labor problems. The
GOI brought about changes in pricing and distribution policies which stimulated rapid growth
of the industry. Installed capacity grew by nearly 10% a year during 1980-85. To
counteract the problems caused by interruptions in power supplies, the industry began to
install captive power plants, particularly in conjunction with expansion and greenfield plants.
However, problems associated with high ash coal and declining coal quality had become more
acute in the wet process plants. At the start of seventh Five Year Plan in 1985-86, the total
installed capacity was 44.6 million tpa. Only 58% of the total kiln capacity was based on the
more energy-efficient dry or semi-dry processes and the rest on wet process technology.
1.2  Involvement of the World Bank
The GOI had initial discussions with the World Bank in June 1979 and the Bank
mission came in September and November 1979 to study the cement industry in detail. The
major recommendations contained in the cement sub-sector project in respect of pricing,
output, control and distribution policies and energy conservation and modernization in the
industry were adopted by the GOI. Following further discussions with GOI and cement
industry representatives, the World Bank decided to support the industry in introducing
measures aimed at energy conservation, improvement of the environment and cost reduction.
Project appraisal was completed in September 1985.
The project was approved by the Bank Board in March 1986 and the loans (borrower
GOI for one loan of $165 million with onlending of $163.5 million to IDBI and ICICI in
equal proportions, GOI US$ 1.5 million for conducting comprehensive study for skills and
manpower requirements in the cement industry and ICICI for the other loan of $35 million)
became effective in November 1986. The scope of the project was broadened in August 1988
and following that five new sub projects were appraised against the three projects dropped
out and selected for IBRD cum IDBI/ICICI financing. The initial loan closing date was June
30, 1992, but two extensions of one year each became necessary, mainly because of the late
entry of two sub-projects. The loan was finally closed on June 30, 1994.

II. PROJECT DESIGN
2.1   The project consisted of four parts with Part A & C (Ln. 2660-IN) - financing for
plant conversion sub-projects and technical assistance, Part B (Ln. 2661-IN) - financing for
small scale efficiency improvement projects and Part D (Ln. 2660-IN) - formulation of
manpower development strategy. While Part A and C were to be administered by IDBI and
ICICI, Part B by ICICI, Part 'D' was administered first by ICICI and then by Development
Commissioner for Cement Industry. Part 'D' was provided as a grant by GOI for assessing
the training needs for cement industry personnel. A study was conducted by the consultants
and its recommendations implemented by formation of 4 regional training centers in the
country.
LINE 2660-IN
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES & DESCRIPTION
3.1   The objectives of the project were to assist the cement industry in India in improving
operating efficiency, environmental controls, product quality, labor productivity and marketing
and distribution systems, and to train local personnel in the skills required in the cement
industry.
3.2   Plant Conversion subprojects
ACC: Madukkarai, Birla Jute: Satna, India Cement: Sankarnagar, KCP: Macherla,
Kalyanpur Cement and IDCOL Cement were the subprojects covered for conversion of the
wet process kiln with a high capacity dry process kiln with preheater/pre calciner.
3.3   Modernization subprojects
ACC Gagal, ACC Mines Modernization, Energy Savings and Coal Washery, (MEC),
and Birla Jute: Chittorgarh plants were modernized by installation of energy efficient
equipment and also balancing equipment to attain higher levels of production.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
4.0   Proiect Costs
The project costs as given below for some of the sub-projects indicate a saving
in US Dollar terms primarily due to changes in the Rupee/Dollar parity ( US$=Rupees 13 in
1986 at SAR stage and US$=Rupees 31.3 in 1994).  However, in Rupee terms , the cost
overruns occurred due to exchange rate as well as increase in local costs (about 30% increase
in the costs of indigenous equipment).



- 48 -
4.1   ACC: Mladukkarai
The project was completed in April 1989. Commercial production commenced in May
1989 with a time overrun of 12 months. This was due to time taken to learn ICB procedures
as also problems arising out of expiry of rupee payment under bilateral agreement made by
the Government. Further operational problems at machinery suppliers resulted in delay in
delivery of major pyroprocessing machinery.
The completed cost of the project was US$31.80 million (Rs. 455 million) against the
SAR estimate of US$32.65 million (Rs. 424 million). The main components of the overrun
in rupee terms were increase in cost of plant & machinery, preoperative expenses and finance
charges.
4.2   Birla Jute: Satna
The commercial production which was slated for May/June 1989 could only be
achieved by January/February 1990 due to delay in obtaining import licenses, permission from
GOI for engaging consulting services for design, erection and commissioning of the plant.
The actual project cost was US$41.91 million (Rs. 722.10 million) as compared to
US$48.34 million (Rs. 628.41 million) originally envisaged. The cost overrun in rupee terms
was due to increase in the price of steel and other construction materials and inclusion of
additional equipment not originally envisaged as also foreign exchange fluctuation.
4.3   India Cement: Sankarnagar
The plant was scheduled for commissioning by October 1988. However, it was
actually commissioned in August 1990, i.e. time overrun of 22 months due to delay in
obtaining Government approval for appointment of foreign consultants leading to delay in
placement of orders.
The cost of the project originally envisaged was US$72.51 million (Rs. 942.6 million)
while the completed cost was US$60.85 million (Rs. 1064.8 million). The cost overrun in
rupee terms was due to time overrun and foreign exchange fluctuation.
4.4.  KCP: Macherla
The project was scheduled for completion by December 1987 but was delayed by 2
years and finally conmmissioned in December 1989 due to delays in civil construction, supply
of process control and instrumentation system. The cost of the project originally envisaged
was US$18.34 million (Rs. 304 million) but the completed cost was US$24.43 million (Rs.
381.91 million) which was mainly due to increased cost of machinery consequent to
enhancement in the rate of import duty, additional expenditure on civil works and delay in
project implementation.



- 49 -
4.5   Kalvanpur Cements: Baniari (KCL)
KCL was chronically beset with financial problems. It was, however, included for
assistance under the Line because of its location in a cement deficit region and the fact that
conversion from wet to dry process would turn the company around. The project cost at the
time of sanction was estimated at US$58.43 million (Rs. 950 million) which now stands at
US$57.60 million ( Rs. 1800 million). The overrun in rupee terms was mainly due to change
in scope of the project, high preoperative expenses as a result of delay in implementation and
foreign exchange fluctuation.
Delay in implementation of around 17 months occurred as the company was unable to
tie up finances and later on delay in the supply of equipment.
4.6   IDCOL Cement: Bargarh
Owing to delay in obtaining clearances from various Govermment bodies, inadequacy
of internal generation due to unfavorable market conditions for the cement industry and
inability of State Governrnent to provide timely equity support as committed, there was
substantial delay in project implementation. The cost of the project was originally estimated
at US$63.13 million (Rs. 1010 million) while the present estimate is US$46.46 million (Rs.
1640 million). The cost overrun in rupee terms was mainly on account of foreign exchange
fluctuation, increase in prices of equipment and delay in implementation of the project. The
project is now expected to be completed in March 1995 i.e. a time overrun of 24 months.
4.7   ACC: Gagal
Commercial production commenced in March 1993 when all systems were
commissioned except Air Separator and Cement Silo which were completed in September
1993. Project completion was delayed by 5 months which was due to non-availability of
labor due to extreme weather conditions and remoteness of site.
The cost of the project originally envisaged was US$22.29 million (Rs. 390 million)
while the cost of completion was US$12.02 million ( Rs. 378.58 million).
4.8   ACC: MEC
The procurement of original mining equipment and installation of the coal washery
was on time. Energy saving equipment were installed 3 months after schedule.
The original cost of the project was US$13.54 million ( Rs. 237 million) while the
completed cost was US$13.08 (Rs. 412 million). in May 1992, IBRD approved the
procurement of additional equipment as utilization in US$ terms was low due to exchange
fluctuations.



- 50 -
4.9   Birla Jute: Chittorgarh
The commercial production was originally envisaged in September 1992, but was
achieved only in September 1994 about two years behind schedule. The main reason for
delay was rebidding of one of the ICB Packages because of unsatisfactory response.
The completed cost of the project is estimated at US$29.75 million (Rs. 878 million)
as against US$33.14 million (Rs. 580 million) originally envisaged. The cost overrun in
rupee terms was on account of foreign exchange fluctuation on imported equipment and
increase in local costs.
4.10  Technical Assistance and Training
GOI effectively utilized US$ 1.5 million under this loan, for conducting
comprehensive study for skills and manpower requirements in Cement Industry. The
recommendations emerging from this study led to setting up of four regional training centers
with excellent facilities for training of cement plant operators, supervisors and line managers.
V. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
5.1   ACC Madukkarai
Clinker production' of 1500 tpd was achieved within 8 weeks of plant commissioning.
Presently the plant is producing 0.6 million tonnes per annum of cement . Guaranteed fuel
consumption was achieved and fuel consumption is less than 959 kcal/kg. The power
consumption has been reduced from 120 kWVhtonne to 103 kWh/tonne.
5.2   Birla Jute :Satna
After conversion from wet to dry process the company has been able to raise the
clinker production from 1750 tpd to 2350 tpd, reduce coal consumption from 34% to 18%
and power consumption from 119 to 109 kWh/tonne of cement.
5.3   India Cement: Sankarnagar
The envisaged increase in capacity to one million tonnes per annum of cement has
been achieved. The plant has necessary equipment for environmental control to achieve the
1/    One tonne of clinker yields approximately 1.05 tonne of OPC.



- 51 -
required emission level of 250 mg. per NM3 and emission level is well within norms (about
100 mg per NM3.
Power consumption has come down from 120 kWh/tonne to 119 kWh/tonne of
cement. Fuel consumption is 827 kcallkg of clinker as against 1419 kcaL/kg under the wet
process.
5.4   KCP: Macherla
With the replacement of wet process kilns the coal consumption dropped from 45% to
less than 20% by weight of clinker while the power consumption came down from about 140
to about 124 kWhltonne of cement. The atmospheric and fugitive emission are controlled to
less that 75 mg/NM3.
5.5   Kalyanpur Cements: Baniari
The project was completed in August 1994 and is on trial run. The capacity utilization
in the year of normal operations has been assumed at 90%. Power consumption is expected
to come down to 98 kWh/tonne from 125 kWhltonne and coal consumption from 36% to
22%.
5.6  IDCOL Cement: Bargarh
The project is still under implementation and is expected to be commissioned by
March 1995 i.e. time overrun of 24 months.
The capacity utilization in the year of normal operations (1996-97) has been assumed
at 95%. Power consumption is expected to come down to 100 kWh from 110-115 kWh per
tonne of cement.
5.7   ACC: Gaaal
Production of cement has gone up to 0.86 million tonnes per annum. The output of
the 2 cement mills has increased to 90 tph each. The current fuel consumption is 859 kcalUkg.
of clinker.
5.8   ACC: MEC
The setting up of a coal washery in a cement plant for improving the quality of coal
which is beset with high ash content and lots of impurities is first of its kind in India. ACC
has achieved reduction in man power from 2065 to 1720 and has realized Rs 40.9 million
from sale of old machines.
The evaluated benefits for these investments aggregate Rs 113.10 per annum due to
energy savings, reduction in man power and cost of stores and spares (Rs. 51.10 million),



- 52 -
additional cement production (Rs. 60.00 million) and reduction in the loss by way of higher
interest burden due to higher inventory holding (Rs. 2.00 million).
5.9   Birla Jute: Chittorgarh
After modernization, the company has been able to achieve a coal consumption of
19% as against 22% prior to modernization and power consumption of 110 kWh/tonne as
against 120 kWh/tonne earlier. The cement capacity has increased from 0.95 million tpa to
1.40 million tpa.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF IDBI/ICICI
6.1    During the loan period extending over 8 years from 1986 to 1994, a lot of changes
have taken place at the macro level in the country as also in IDBI/ICICI. The loan being
rupee tied, a number of cement units with wet process approached for foreign currency loans
under the Line which conferred on them a lot of benefits. IDBI/ICICI on their part, extended
all the required assistance and helped the sub-borrowers in observing the ICB procedures for
availing assistance. Even earlier, GOI, IDBI and ICICI were seriously thinking of converting
the highly polluting and energy inefficient wet process cement plants into dry process plants
with modem technology. Right from the stage of appraisal of the project, IDBI/ICICI have
been active in sanctioning, disbursing and implementing the projects. When some of the
original subprojects included in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) did not materialize,
IDBI/ICICI identified other substitute subprojects.
6.2  IDBI/ICICI have been co-ordinating the follow-up supervision visits undertaken by
the World Bank mission regularly and arranging meetings with the concerned officials in the
Ministry of Finance/Ministry of Industry, GOI, the Development Council for Cement
Industry, coal authorities, railway authorities as also the Consulate General in the Danish
Embassy and sub-borrowers.
VII. PERFORMANCE OF WORLD BANK
7.1   The Bank loan was given effect to at a time when foreign exchange for importing
machinery was scarce in the country and was highly regulated by GOI. Cement industry was
in need of modernization by induction of latest state-of-art technology. Consequently, a
number of cement plants operating on wet process were covered under the Line and got
converted into energy efficient dry process. This had the demonstration effect since all the
new greenfield plants set up thereafter also adopted the modern technology for their plants.
Thus the Bank assistance under the loan was a pace setter for dry process plants. As already
mentioned in the introduction, the installed capacity of 44 million tpa increased to 65.0
million as on March 31, 1993 marking an increase of 48%. The World Bank acted as a
catalyst in removing the control on prices and distribution of cement in India. With free
market cement becoming easily available, it has opened channels for exports which have



- 53 -
picked up considerably. From cement scarcity, India has come to a stage of cement surplus.
With the encouraging experience gained in the first Line, the World Bank also extended the
Second Line for an enhanced amount of US$300 million. GOI has asked the World Bank to
consider extension of another Line for the development of infrastructure and abatement of
industrial pollution.
VIII. OPERATION EXPERIENCE/KEY LESSONS LEARNED
8.1   The Loan was approved at a time when cement companies were averse to undertake
modernization as import of machinery would have exposed them to foreign exchange risks.
GOI agreed to bear the foreign exchange risk for assistance under the line of credit. The
Line being Rupee-tied, the sub-borrowers availing assistance for import of machinery could
repay in rupee.
8.2   The ICB procedure, though perceived as cumbersome by some sub-borrowers,
conferred benefits of exemption from import and excise duties to the sub-borrowers. In most
of the cases the indigenous machinery manufacturers won the bids , which encouraged them
to expand and modernize to become internationally competitive.
8.3   Regular interaction with the sub-borrowers throughout the monitoring and review
period enabled IDBI/ICICI to assess the factors that contribute to effective project
implementation.
8.4   IDBI/ICICI were able to develop a better perspective on proven state of art
technologies in the cement sector as also better knowledge of environmental protection
policies of the World Bank and pollution control measures and strategies in cement industry
on a global scale.
8.5     Social Obiectives
With the conversion of wet process into dry process plants, coupled with enhancement
of the plant capacity, the profitability of the units assisted under these loans had shown
definite improvement. The plants had necessarily to increase the employment which meant
alleviation of poverty and in the unskilled sector, employment to the local and tribal people.
The modernized plants also developed selfcontained townships with essential arnenities like
schools, hospitals, banks etc.. All the cement units have grown gardens and taken up
afforestation on a massive scale.
8.6   Environmental Protection
With the insistence of the World Bank/GOI/IDBI/ICICI the pollution control measures



- 54 -
have tightened and the guidelines are being scrupulously observed and monitored. Cement
plants have become conscious that controlling the particulate emissions increases production
of cement in addition to pollution abatement.
IX. IMPACT OF PROJECT ON THE INDUSTRY
9.1   The project helped in the development of the cement industry in many ways.
9.2   While the line was in operation, the World Bank could take up with GOI, the case of
decontrol of distribution and price of cement. Adoption of the latest state-of-art technology
resulted in increased production, cost reduction and improved profitability in addition to
pollution control. Though only nine subprojects benefited under the Line, cement plants
subsequently set up in the country were all based on dry process only.
9.3   The subborrowers benefited in many ways. Foreign exchange assistance was free from
exchange risk. Clearance of licenses etc. for import of machinery was available under one
roof. Under the ICB procedure borrowers got the benefit of exemption from excise duty and
their gain was around 20-25% of the total machinery cost. Introduction of the Line for
cement industry in India and the benefits thereof gave impetus for extending a new line
(Ln. 3196-IN) for greenfield projects, which was well received.
9.4   The cement industry has shown remarkable progress in the last few years, with an
annual growth rate of about 7% and today India is the fifth largest producer of cement in the
World after China, Russia, Japan and USA. As a result of decontrol of prices and distribution
of cement, the industry has grown 2 1/2 times in terms of total installed capacity in 1980-81
to 1992-93. Presently, 84% of the total capacity is based on energy efficient and environment
friendly dry process technology. The quality of cement produced has improved and the
industry is now in a position to meet not only domestic but also the export demand. Many of
the quality conscious units have obtained ISO-9000 certifications for quality assurance to be
competitive in the global markets.
9.5.  The cement industry in India has come to robust health as is evident by a number of
cement companies accessing the global capital markets for taking up further projects, with the
GOI adopting economic and financial reforms.
9.6   With exports picking up, some of the cement companies are setting up Export Oriented
Units. This is a clear indication that Indian cement is of international quality and globally
competitive.



- 55 -
X. OPERATING PLAN
10.1  During the ICR Mission in June/July 1994 , an Operation Plan by the participating
companies was prepared and agreed to by IDBI/ICICI and the World Bank mission and the
plan became part of the Aide Memoire (Annex 3). Four companies - ACC, Birla Jute, India
Cement and KCP which were appraised originally in the SAR and which have completed
their projects and are financially sound and profit making companies. They are being regularly
monitored by IDBI/ICICI by way of quarterly progress reports, periodical field visits and
reports submitted by the Directors nominated by IDBI/ICICI on the Boards of these
companies. These reports contain exhaustive details on the companies' performance in respect
of production, efficiency parameters and profitability.
10.2  IDCOL Cement    This substitute project, approved in August, 1991, has since
tied over the local cost financial problems and is in the process of restructuring its
management. IDBI/ICICI are closely monitoring compliance with the agreed restructuring
program. After implementation of the modernization and expansion scheme in March, 1995,
the company's profitability is expected to improve further since its input costs would go
down and, being located in a cement deficit region, it sales realization would be higher.
10.3  Kalvanpur Cements  This project approved in July, 1988, is beset with financial
problems. Notwithstanding the then weak financial position of the company, IDBI/ICICI
chose to finance this modem dry process project in the hope of turning around the company
and the World Bank agreed to it. With the implementation of expansion cum modernization
scheme, based on state-of-art technology, the company is expected to make improved
profitability by achieving economies of scale. The Indian cement industry is presently doing
well and the project, being located in the cement deficit State of Bihar, would also cater to
adjourning large markets of Bengal and Nepal.
A plan for capital restructuring of the company including infusion of fresh
equity is being worked out. IDBI/ICICI are not only intensively monitoring the
operations/performance of the unit but also extending assistance to formulate a restructuring
plan for its revival.
LINE 2661-IN
XI. SMALL SCALE MODERNIZATION PROJECTS
11.1  The Line was directly lent to ICICI for import of equipment to provide support for
small scale projects with the exchange fluctuation risks passed on to the subborrowers.
However, not many subborrowers were willing to bear the foreign exchange risks and the
immediate response to the Line was poor. Hence GOI later agreed to bear the foreign
exchange risk and the scope was also widened to cover Rupee expenditure. This led to



- 56 -
speedy disbursement of funds under this loan.
11.2  Proiect Benefits  Assistance under the Line was extended to 20 subprojects. The
funds were mostly used to supplement the ongoing modernization programs of the sub-
borrowers for import of latest technical know-how and equipment. All subprojects have been
completed. The project sponsors have benefited not only by way of improvement in energy
consumption/cost reduction of cement plants but also by installation of coal washeries,
improvement in captive power plant, research center equipments, etc. The objective of the
Line to provide quick disbursal of funds to a large number of small scale modernization
projects was thus achieved.
