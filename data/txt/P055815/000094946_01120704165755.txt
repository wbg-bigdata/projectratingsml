THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
THIRD ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ADJUSTMENT LOAN (ECAL III)
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:                     The Republic of Tunisia.
Amount and Terms:             EURO 281 million (US$252.5 million equivalent) customized
commitment-linked Fixed-Spread Loan (FSL) to be disbursed in one
standard tranche of EURO 144.69 million (US$130 million
equivalent), a capitalized front-end fee of EURO 2.81 million
(US$2.5 million equivalent), and three floating tranches of EURO
44.5 million (US$40 million equivalent) each. The three floating
tranches are respectively linked to structural reforms to: (a) improve
the private investment climate, (b) further strengthen the financial
sector, including insurance, and (c) liberalize the information and
communication technology sector. The lending rate applicable is
6-month LIBOR plus a fixed spread for FSLs denominated in
EURO. The loan repayment period will be 16.5 years, including a
five-year grace period. Interest and other charges will be payable
semi-annually on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The final
reimbursement date is May 15, 2018.
Loan Description:             The proposed loan is the third in a series of policy reform operations
and supports the Government's program to enhance the international
competitiveness of Tunisia's economy. It is aimed at promoting
private investment, strengthening the financial sector, and
liberalizing the information and communication technology sector,
while maintaining a stable macroeconomic framework. The loan
builds on reforms in the real sector initiated under ECAL I and seeks
to deepen improvements in performance and efficiency in the
financial sector supported under ECAL U1.
Benefits:                     Sound   macroeconomic   performance  and   private  sector
competitiveness are recognized by Tunisia as prerequisites for
achieving its ambitious growth, investment, and employment targets
for 2002-2006. The impact of the policy measures supported by this
loan is expected to be substantial. In particular, the loan will benefit
Tunisia's public and private sectors through efficiency gains and a
more transparent investment climate, with continued disengagement
of the State from the economy. It will contribute to the soundness
and transparency of the financial sector, thereby improving access to
financial services for enterprises and individuals while reducing the
cost of these  services.   The  loan  will also  open the
telecommunications sector to competition and private participation,
lowering prices and improving access to service for consumers.



ii
Risks:                          A sudden worsening of international economic or security condi.nons
could slow reform and propel short-term macroeconomic
stabilization to the top of Tunisia's economic agenda. There is a risk
of slow implementation due to the need to consult with labor un3ons
to implement certain insurance sector reforms. Finally, the effective
introduction of competition in the telecommunications sector may
take more time than projected, in light of the relatively tight financial
situation of most operators worldwide. The operation is not expected
to present any substantial social or environmental risks. Its measures
are not foreseen to require lay-offs or to have a negative impact on
incomes or employment of any specific group. Any environmental
issues arising from the sale of government-held shares to private
entities will be addressed in the context of Tunisia's environmental
legislation and will comply with the Bank's safeguard policies.
Risk Mitigation:              The risk of a slowdown of the reform program following an
unexpected deterioration of the international economic or security
environment is limited for the following reasons.  First, the
authorities have identified additional macroeconomic stabilization
measures to be put in place if needed. Second, Tunisia has an
established record of commitment to structural reforms. Finally, the
proposed loan structure of three floating tranches will allow the
Government to disburse a specific tranche once reforms have been
implemented in a single sector, rather than waiting for completion of
all reforms covered by the program.  This flexibility will be
especially helpful if faster disbursement is required due to additional
pressures on the country's balance of payments. With regard to
reforms in the insurance sector, the Govemment's gradual approach
based on careful, though time-consuming, internal consensus-
building presents a risk of delay rather than non-completion of the
planned measures; this risk is also mitigated by the floating tranche
structure.  In telecommunications, the authorities' open and
transparent selection process for the second GSM operator represents
the best guarantee to attract sound proposals from qualified bidders.
Further incentive to implement the reform program is provided by
parallel financing, based on the same policy reform matrix, from the
African Development Bank and the European Union.
Estimated Disbursement:       The loan will be disbursed in one standard tranche and three floating
tranches. The release of the floating tranches will be conditioned on
continued satisfactory macroeconomic performance, adequate
implementation of the overall reform program for each sector, and on
the implementation of specific policy measures linked to each
floating tranche, as specified in the Loan Agreement. The closing
date of the proposed loan will be June 30, 2003.
Co-financing:                 AfDB: EURO 216 million equivalent
European Union: EURO 80 million
Project Identification Number:  TN-PE-55815



REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED THIRD ECONOMIC
COMPETITIVENESS ADJUSTMENT LOAN (ECAL III) TO THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.     I submit for your approval the following report and recommendations on a proposed
Third Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL III) to the Republic of Tunisia in an
amount of EURO 281 million (US$252.5 million equivalent). The loan supports a reform
program including actions to improve Tunisia's private investment climate, strengthening
competition and corporate governance; reinforce the regulatory and supervisory framework in the
financial sector, in particular in insurance; and liberalize the telecommunications sector. The
proposed program is largely based on the work of the authorities in preparing the forthcoming
10f' five-year development plan and on the recommendations of four recent Bank reports: the
Private Sector Assessment Update, the Social and Structural Review, the Review of External
Sustainability, and the Information and Communications Technology Strategy.1
2.     The loan supports Tunisia's macroeconomic stability in the face of weakening external
conditions. Tunisia has demonstrated its firm commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies
and has established credibility among international investors and domestic economic agents.
Tunisia's external environment, however, has deteriorated recently with export demand, tourism,
remittances, and capital inflows all negatively affected by weakening world economic
performance, particularly in Europe. Uncertainties in the external environment could lead to
additional pressures on the balance of payments by increasing financing requirements or by
temporarily raising the cost of borrowing on international markets.  In response to this
challenging external environment, the authorities have strengthened their domestic financial
policies and stand ready to adopt additional measures if necessary.
3.     The proposed operation would be the third in a series. The first ECAL (ECAL I)
introduced wide-ranging first generation actions aimed at promoting private sector development
(PSD); the second ECAL (ECAL II) supported improvements in the soundness, efficiency, and
competitiveness of the banking system. ECAL III consists of a broad range of second generation
measures aimed at enhancing PSD, pursuing financial sector reform and expanding it to the non-
bank financial sector, and supporting the liberalization of the telecommunications sector.
4.     The proposed loan is consistent with the base-case scenario reflected in the Bank Group
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tunisia discussed by the Executive Directors on April 27,
2000. The proposed loan amount represents a US$100 million increase in the level of adjustment
lending foreseen in the CAS, reflecting a faster pace of reform in some areas identified by the
CAS as high-case triggers (financial sector reform and liberalization in the telecommunications
sector). This increase is proposed in response to worsening external economic conditions and a
slowdown in tourism and export receipts. Combined adjustment and investment lending levels,
however, remain in line with CAS projections. The proposed operation has been prepared in
collaboration with the European Union (EU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB) who
will support the Government's program on the basis of a common action matrix with,
respectively, a grant of EURO 80 million and loan of EURO 216 million equivalent. In addition,

the macroeconomic framework and performance indicators for this operation have been defined
in close collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
II.    RECENT ECONoMIc DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPECTS
A.     MACROECONOMIC BACKGROUND
5.     After successfully implementing stabilization and structural adjustment programs, ' hich
begun in the late 1980s, the authorities have, since the mid-1990s, turned their attention to
creating the conditions needed to integrate the country with the global economy, in particular
with Europe, and rapidly converge toward developed countries' living standards. The strategy
has included securing a WTO membership as of 1994 and signing the Association Agreement
with the European Union (AAEU) in 1995. International financial markets have responded
positively, and since 1994, Tunisia has consistently improved its access to the sovereign hond
markets. Sovereign debt has thus become a prominent source of foreign financing, as non-clebt
sources of financing remain low. Notwithstanding its strong macroeconomic framework, the cost
of accessing the sovereign debt market for Tunisia can change with developments in other
emerging market economies or at the global level. For example, after the September 11 th terrorist
attacks in the U.S., the spreads quoted for Tunisian bonds increased, though to a lesser extent than
for many other emerging market economies. Similarly, Tunisia's spreads increased after the
1997 East Asian financial crisis, causing the authorities to give up borrowing from financial
markets in 1998 and instead tap their already low international reserves.
6.     Historically, Tunisia has mitigated or managed the impacts of external shocks-including
the mid-1980s oil shock, the Gulf war, the early 1990s economic slowdown in Europe, andl the
1997 East Asia crisis-through sound socio-economic policies. This resilience rests in pail on
the fact that external financing for the whole economy is, by and large, mobilized by the public
sector, and that capital inflows and outflows are subject to controls. If the private sector is to play
an increasing role in mobilizing external financing, capital flows will be more sensitive to
external shocks. Going forward, it is therefore critical to preserve the strong macroeconomic
framework and ensure a close monitoring of external vulnerabilities.
7.    In 2000, economic growth rate, at 4.7 percent, was lower than the average for the
previous five years (5.2 percent) and markedly lower than the 6.1 percent achieved in 1999 (see
Table 1). The somewhat weak outcome for 2000 was largely caused by a contraction in
agricultural value-added and to a lesser extent by slower growth in the services sector. The
manufacturing sector continued to grow at a healthy pace, despite the challenge of liberalization
of manufactured imports from the EU and from some partners in the Arab world. The
unemployment rate declined slightly in 2000 thanks to a sizeable increase in job creation outside
agriculture; however, unemployment remains high, at more than 15 percent, considering
Tunisia's good record of economic growth and its ambitions for the future.

8.      The current account deficit widened significantly to 4.2 percent of GDP in 2000,
compared to 2.1 percent in 1999 and 3.4 percent in 1998. Factors underlying this deterioration
were partly exogenous. Insufficient rainfall caused a deterioration of the food balance; high
energy prices worked to deteriorate the energy balance; and the appreciation of the dollar vis-a-
vis the dinar boosted external debt service and inflated some import bills.2 In addition to these
exogenous factors, imports of equipment goods and raw material by investing firms increased
markedly; this, however, bodes well for the future because these investments are likely to
contribute to future exports. On the financing side, foreign direct investment more than doubled
2   It is noteworthy that those exogenous factors may not be short-lived, as insufficient rainfall and high energy prices
continue to affect the current account deficit adversely in 2001 and may do so again in 2002.

in 2000, largely due to the successful sale of two state-owned cement companies to foreign
investors for a total of about US$268 million. Also, Tunisia mobilized the equivalent of
US$459 million on the Global Samurai bond market in the summer of 2000 at very favorable
spreads. However, overall external financing in 2000 fell short of the amount needed to maintain
international reserves at 3 months of imports, the level achieved in 1999 and originally targeted
for 2000 by the authorities.
9.     Overall, Tunisia's economic performance in 2000-and indeed over the past decade or
so-has been underpinned by prudent macroeconomic policies. The overall fiscal deficit was
reduced from 6.2 percent of GDP in 1990 to 3.3 percent in 2000.3 The monetary stance has been
prudent, and the exchange rate management fairly flexible. The growth of monetary aggregates
has gradually been brought into line with nominal GDP growth, and inflation declined from an
average of 4.7 percent during 1992-97 to 2.9 percent during 1998-2000. The Central Bank has
discontinued its policy of financing all the liquidity needs of commercial banks, thus encouraging
them to use the inter-bank money market more actively. Since late 2000, the Central Bank has
been allowed to undertake open market policy. Thanks to the flexible management of the
exchange rate, supported by capital controls, the authorities have managed to prevent a significant
real appreciation of the currency vis-a-vis Tunisia's trade partners.
B.     SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM PROSPECTS AND FINANCING NEEDS
10.    The prospects for the Tunisian economy presented below are based on the assumptions
about the global economy contained in the lower part of Table 1. The September 11 terrorist
attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., have already led to significant revisions in prospects
for the global economy as well as for Tunisia. If the impacts of the recent events on the world
economy were to be worse than currently projected, the prospects for Tunisia would also be
lowered.
11.    Year 2001. Preliminary data suggest that the authorities have been able to maintain a
sound macroeconomic framework in 2001 despite drought conditions affecting agricultural
production and an economic slowdown in Europe and industrialized countries in general. Overall
GDP growth is expected to reach 5.2 percent. Both manufacturing (excluding agro-industry) and
construction are expected to have grown at high rates. Agricultural value-added is expected to
decline by 0.5 percent year-to-year, and the weak agricultural season will entail high food imports
and low agricultural exports, having a large adverse impact on the trade balance. High oil prices
in the first three quarters have also adversely affected the trade balance, because Tunisia is a net
oil importer. These adverse effects will be compounded by the impact of the September 11"'
events on fourth quarter tourist arrivals and tourism receipts. Overall, however, these adverse
effects will be offset by the very good performance of tourism and manufactured exports during
the first three quarters of 200 1,4 and the current account deficit should be similar to the 2000
level, at about 4.3 percent of GDP. High international petroleum prices during most of the year
have created a significant gap between import prices and controlled domestic sale prices, leading
to important budgetary outlays. Although some food prices have been increased, food price
subsidies and the increase in the wage bill will also represent a weight on the budget. Despite
these pressures, the budget deficit will be approximately 2.8 percent of GDP, lower than the 2000
level, largely due to a strong increase in tax revenues.
3 The deficit numbers quoted in the text refer to the consolidated deficit of central government and the social
security funds.
4 Tourism receipts increased by 14 percent during January-September 2001 compared to the same period in 2000;
manufactured exports increased by more than 19 percent (with exports of mechanical and electrical equipments
increasing at a strong 33 percent).



5
12.    Year 2002. Perspectives for 2002 are not as good. Based on current assumptions on
economic activity in Europe as well as on agricultural production in Tunisia, overall GDP growth
should reach 4.9 percent in Tunisia in 2002, a significant decrease from the 5.8 percent projected
before the September 11t events. Some pressures could arise on the current account deficit.
Indeed, although the trade liberalization strategy works to create a more favorable external
environment for domestic businesses by providing better access to foreign inputs at world prices
and better access to global technologies through joint ventures, in the short-term it could, as
happened in 2000-2001, lead to higher imports of capital goods and some substitution of
domestic production for imports. Expected low value-added in the agriculture sector due to
insufficient rainfall (at least up to October 2001) will continue to pull exports downward while
pushing imports upward. The economic slowdown in the world economy, in particular in the
Euro zone and with regard to the tourism sector, represent additional challenges for Tunisia in
2002.
13.   Aware of these challenges, the authorities are pursuing policies that can help contain the
current account deficit at about 3.8 percent of GDP in 2002. First, public savings will be
increased by bringing the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio down by 0.5 percentage points, to
2.3 percent of GDP. This will be achieved through tighter expenditure control and further
strengthening of the tax base. At the same time, the authorities will better monitor the finances of
public enterprises while ensuring these public enterprises deliver goods and services more
efficiently. In addition, the authorities will create the conditions for improved private savings by
strengthening the insurance sector (and specifically promoting life insurance) and continue efforts
to improve loan recovery in the banking sectors.
14.   External Financing Needs and Financing Plan. External financing needs for 2001 are
estimated at US$1.95 billion (Table 2). With grants estimated at US$56 million, foreign direct
investment at US$364 million, and short-term outflow estimated at US$287 million, borrowing
needs would amount to about US$1.8 billion. In March, Tunisia mobilized the equivalent of
about US$460 million from the international sovereign bond market at very favorable spreads.
Currently, the country continues to enjoy a good rating. However, given uncertainties in
international financial markets after the September 11 events and in certain emerging markets, the
Tunisian authorities feel that an additional bond issue in 2001 is not desirable, especially as the
March issue mobilized an amount already as high as yearly amounts mobilized in the past. To
avoid another dec4ine in the reserves level and coverage after that of 2000, the authorities are
making every effort to ensure that much of the financing from official sources in the pipeline for
2001 is realized. Thus, first tranche disbursements under the proposed operation and related
parallel financing could contribute about US$229 million (of which about US$132.5 million from
the IBRD loan and about US$97 million from the related AfDB loan). Additional multilateral
and bilateral loans and trade financing and other forms of financing received by the private sector
throughout the year would amount to about US$724 million and US$400 million, respectively.
With this financing plan, the end of year reserves level is expected to be at US$1.7 billion,
equivalent to 2.2 months of imports. This low level of reserves is in part due to the postponement
of the issuance of the second global system mobile (GSM) license originally planned for 2001.

15.    For 2002, Tunisia's financing needs are projected to amount to about US$2.6 billion as a
result of a fairly large current account deficit and amortization bill, as well as the targeted sizable
increase in reserves so as to be able to attain an import coverage of 3 months by 2003. These
financing needs would be met through a balanced mix of borrowing from the intemational
financial markets and multilateral development finance institutions, foreign direct investment, and
grants. Financing from public sources and grants would include all three of the floating tranches
from the proposed IBRD loan in a total amount of about US$120 million, about US$97 million
from the related AfDB loan, and about US$72 million from the related EU grant. Projected
foreign direct investment includes the sale of a second GSM license to a private telephone
operator as planned in the program supported by the proposed operation. The end of year
reserves level is expected to reach US$2.4 billion, equivalent to some 2.9 months of imports.
16.    There are, however, downside risks to this financing plan. Even though expected lower
interest rates in developed countries might allow for a lower cost of borrowing, intemational
financial markets might demand higher spreads for emerging market borrowing due to possible
uncertainties at the global level. Moreover, if the recession that started in the fourth quarter of
2001 in the U.S. were to be prolonged and spread to Europe, Tunisia's growth rate would be
lower and its current account deficit higher in 2002 as result of lower tourism activities, exports,
and possibly workers remittances. Access to intemational financial markets could tighten, and
some FDI projects could be postponed. In such a scenario, the larger current account deficit and
difficulties in accessing intemational financial markets could create a significant financing gap in
2002.
17.    To respond to such a shock and bridge the financing gap, as described below, the
authorities are committed to implementing short-term adjustment measures and accelerating the
implementation of a number of medium-term structural reforms. The acceleration of structural
reforms in an environment of slow global growth would send a strong signal to investors that
Tunisia is a sound alternative to other emerging markets, thus possibly allowing Tunisia to attract
larger amounts of FDI.
18.    Medium Term. In the medium term, Tunisia's economic fundamentals are expected to
remain strong, and external financing is expected to be forthcoming to help achieve GDP growth
in the range of 5.7-6.0 percent during 2003-04. However, given that the current account deficit is



7
relatively high at present and that projected high GDP growth will require somewhat higher
private investment, the authorities plan to increase their adjustment efforts. These efforts include
increasing public savings by bringing down the budget deficit to 2.0 percent of GDP or less.
Given that the savings rate is likely to increase only slowly, however, the faster GDP growth rates
will have to be underpinned by higher productivity growth so as to ease pressures on the current
account balance. Therefore, in addition to measures to improve domestic savings, the authorities
will continue to implement policies aimed at increasing efficiency, easing the transfer of
technology, and reducing the cost of doing business in Tunisia.
III.   THE GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS PROGRAM
19.    The 10'h Development Plan objectives include achieving an average annual growth rate of
5.7 percent during 2002-2006, and a corresponding increase in per capita income of 4.8 percent,
compared to 3.9 percent during the 9 Plan.5 To achieve these goals, the Govemment recognizes
the need to intensify reforms to create conditions more conducive to private sector development.
An important element of the reform program is the continuing, progressive dismantling of trade
barriers under the AAEU. To be fully effective, the AAEU needs to be complemented by
widespread reform to improve the efficiency of domestic markets and attract foreign investors
and partners.
20.    To this end, in September 2000 a commission was put in charge of defining the
Govemment strategy for promoting private investment and competitiveness, drawing upon
conclusions from the Bank Private Sector Assessment Update Report. The commission held a
national conference in November 2000 and prepared an action plan which includes the following
key components:
(a)    Creating a private investment climate that facilitates business startup, operation,
and exit and creates opportunities for private participation. The commission
focused on four key aspects of the private investment climate: (i) investment
promotion and incentives; (ii) administrative procedures; (iii) laws and
regulations relating to corporate govemance; and (iv) privatization and the
opening of key sectors to private investment.
(b)    Mobilizing finance for private investment by promoting: (i) efficient financial
intermediation through a competitive banking sector and a dynamic and deep
capital market; and (ii) reforming the insurance sector, which in the medium to
long-term will be essential to mobilize long-term financial resources for private
investment.
(c)    Reducing the cost and improving the quality of information and communication
technologies, a sector which the commission and the Government have identified
as critical for a modem and open economy.
The components of this strategy have been incorporated into the Govemment program, which is
underpinned by the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework and is being supported by
the ECAL III. The Govemment's program is detailed in the Letter of Development Policy
(Annex I), while its most salient features are described in this chapter.
5  This growth objective requires an increase in total factor productivity (TFP) to account for 44 percent of
production compared to 36 percent during the 9th Plan; an increase in export growth to 7 percent p.a. in an increasingly
competitive environment; and an increase in private investment to account for at least 60 percent of total investment by
2006.



8
A.     MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK AND MEASURES
21.    This component of the program consists of four sets of measures: (a) maintairing a
sound and stable macroeconomic framework; (b) integrating information on extemal debt;
(c) introducing active debt management techniques for public debt; and (d) creating the Conseil
National de la Fiscalite (CNF) to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability and improve efficiency
and equity.
22.    Maintaining a Sound Macroeconomic Framework. With an increasingly liberalized
external environment and greater reliance on international financial markets, it is critical to
preserve Tunisia's sound macroeconomic framework. In the context of this operation, the
macroeconomic framework will be assessed against the indicators set forth in Table 3, selected
for the role they play in achieving economic competitiveness. The levels indicated in Table 3 are
based on the assumptions indicated in Table 1 above. The assessment of macroeconomic
developments in the country as they relate to the loan will benefit from data and other information
that the authorities will send to the Bank on a quarterly basis. In case of events that jeopardize
the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework, or in case of marked deviations from the
macroeconomic framework agreed upon and set forth in Table 3, the authorities will initiate
consultations with the Bank and the International Monetary Fund so as to identify the sources of
the deviations, and design and implement adequate policy responses.

23.   Integrating Information on External Debt. A cornerstone of risk management is the
adoption of a system for comprehensive information on extemal debt. Following unsuccessful
attempts during the 1990s, the authorities have been able to put in place an integrated and
computerized debt database in 2001.
24.    Introducing Active Debt Management Techniques. The authorities also plan to introduce
active debt management techniques for external and domestic public debt so as to minimize the
cost of debt service in the future. The need for active debt management has increased with:
(a) the presence of Tunisia in the international financial markets; (b) increasing exposure to
changing borrowing conditions for emerging market economies and exchange rate fluctuations;
and (c) increasing dependence on market-determined prices for domestic bonds following the
recent reform of the domestic bond market. At the same time, there are better conditions today



9
for active debt management, with the emergence of a secondary market for tradable Government
domestic bonds and the deepening of the secondary market for Tunisian debt instruments on the
international sovereign bond market. Hence, the authorities will design institutional and legal
arrangements for active debt management, drawing from the recommendations of a study to be
launched by end-2002.
25.    Creation of a National Taxation Council.  As envisaged in the Code des Droits et
Procedures Fiscaux (2000), a National Taxation Council (Conseil National de la Fiscalite or
CNF) has been created (Decree No. 2001-1250 of May 28, 2001) with the aim of continuously
assessing the tax structure and ensuring its ability to raise revenues in an efficient and equitable
manner. The CNF is a consultative body with broad membership which includes representatives
from relevant Ministries and other public agencies, professional organizations and associations,
and individual experts. Moreover, the president of the CNF can invite any other person whose
presence is deemed useful to deal effectively with the issues on a CNF meeting's agenda. The
Council is expected to play an important role in modernizing and reforming Tunisia's tax system
in light of changing economic and social needs.
B.     PRIVATE INVESTMENT CLIMATE
B.1    Current Situation
26.    Role of the Private Sector.6 The private sector accounts for 63 percent of Tunisia's GDP,
a slight increase from 60 percent in 1990. In terms of value added and employment, the private
sector dominates agriculture, fishing, and the bulk of manufacturing but has little participation in
most infrastructure activities. Apart from a few dozen enterprises which employ more than
500 workers and belong mostly to the public and financial sectors, the majority of Tunisian firms
are small private units.' An offshore sector was created through special incentives to counter the
anti-export bias of the protected domestic economy in the 1970s and 1980s, and although it fueled
the country's strong export performance and facilitated Tunisia's entry into world markets, the
offshore sector has insulated the domestic private sector from pressure to improve
competitiveness. In fact, the offshore sector has developed very few linkages with the onshore
economy. While the private sector's share in GDP and total investment has remained low
(51 percent), the sector's contribution to the growth of value-added of non-financial enterprises
has increased steadily since the mid-1990s.
27.    Remaining Constraints. The results of the Private Sector Assessment Update indicated
that many Tunisian enterprises are apprehensive about market demand and competition. They
also face a complex investment incentive regime, taxation and other administrative constraints,
difficulties in access to finance (especially for Small and Medium Enterprises, or SMEs), high
cost of telecommunications and marine transport, and insufficient supply of industrial land. In
addition, government involvement in sectors such as telecommunications, transport, and banking
continues to inhibit increased private investment.
28.    Investment Incentives. The Government has established a generous system of tax and
financial incentives for business investment for specific activities, priority regions, and certain
categories of entrepreneurs. The most significant beneficiaries of this system have been offshore
6 For more information, refer to the Republic of Tunisia Private Sector Assessment Update: Meeting the Challenge
of Globalization, December 14, 2000, Report No. 20173-TUN.
7   Out of about 87,000 formal sector firms, only 1,400 employ more than 100 workers. In the industrial sector, firms
with fewer than 20 employees account for almost 60 percent of all active private companies, and companies with fewer
than 250 employees account for more than 94 percent of all companies.



10
enterprises; the Tunisian investment incentive regime needs to be further simplified and
streamlined if it is to encourage private investment in the onshore sector. Tax and financial
incentives have had a significant fiscal cost, but their results appear mixed in terms of impact on
increasing private investment. In addition, unless equitable incentives are put in place for
onshore and offshore firms, when full implementation of the AAEU lifts remaining bariers
currently protecting onshore enterprises, these enterprises are likely to be at a strong
disadvantage.
29.    Administrative Barriers to Business Start-up and Operations.  Despite significant
progress in reducing administrative barriers to private sector activity, some rigidities remain,
especially for onshore enterprises. These barriers increase transaction costs, discourage local, and
foreign private investment, and reduce Tunisia's external competitiveness. The one-stop shop
(guichet unique) of the Agence de Promotion de l 'Industrie (API), which was certified ISO 9002
in June 2000, has greatly facilitated business registration and startup in the manufacturing sector
by assembling in one place all the general steps required for business startup. Delays occur,
however, when a new    project requires authorizations.  Prior authorizations relating to
environment, labor, and sectoral regulations are still relatively numerous and also hamper
business startups in non-manufacturing sectors.
30.    Significant progress in streamlining and improving customs procedures has recently been
made. The modernization of the Customs' Computer System (Systfme Informatique des Douanes
or SINDA), the adoption of normalized and simplified documentation (liasse unique) for
administrative procedures involved in external trade transactions to replace a multiplicity of
documents, and the implementation of an electronic data interchange (EDI) system at Tunisie
Trade Net (TTN) have also been supported by the World Bank' and the EU. To reduce steps and
costs involved in trade transactions, TTN's system now needs to interface with customs, banks,
trade forwarders, shipping agents, Ministry of Commerce's systems, and other actors involved in
trade transactions. While much progress has been made to develop this interface, the link with
customs SINDA system remains to be completed.
31.    Ports are also a major bottleneck. Goods in Tunisian ports spend up to 18 days in
storage. Much of this time is voluntary, as traders use the port as a substitute for inland storage,
but retention is sometimes also involuntary, due to administrative procedures or inefficiencies in
port services, including restrictive labor practices, and imposes an economic burden. The
Government has taken steps to address these bottlenecks, but much remains to be done. The
Code des Ports Maritimes de Commerce (1999), allows for private participation in service
provision in all Tunisian ports, but Societe Tunisienne d 'Acconnage et de Manutention (STAM),
a public enterprise, still enjoys a monopoly in Rades, where most unitized cargo is received. The
two pending and somewhat interrelated issues, namely the lack of competition in Rades and the
dockers' monopoly nationwide, are being addressed under the Transport Sector Project.9 T arget
dates have been set for privatization of STAM, elimination of the dockers' monopoly, and
opening of Rades to competition. Cargo handling will also be reorganized, and new conditions
for access to the market will be set to facilitate creation of private companies with enough means
to invest in port equipment.
32.    Tax procedures constitute an additional administrative constraint. Value added tax
(VAT) credit reimbursement procedures are cumbersome, creating liquidity problems for
enterprises. Enterprises can get an advance of 15 percent on the amount owed to them. but
The Tunisia Export Development Project (Project 55814, Loan 44750-TUN), in the amount of US$35 million
equivalent, was approved on May 20, 1999.
9  Loans 43570-TUN and 43580-TUN (Project 43700) for a total of FRF 300.7 million equivalent, were approved on
June 23, 1998.



11
reimbursement can still take up to six months. Long delays also occur for exempted imports, and
there is a lack of clarity in the relationship between enterprises and tax administrators. Tunisian
firms complain about the arbitrary process followed by the tax administration in determining the
amount of the tax to which they are subject, and the lack of clarity in ex-post controls and the
determination of penalties in case of erroneous declarations. These elements make it difficult for
the private sector to carry out advance tax planning. The problems are due in part to the
multiplicity of tax regimes and tax procedures and frequent changes in the tax regime, and in part
to the tax administration's need to strengthen its capacity to apply the tax regime in a uniform
manner.
33.    Access to industrial land is difficult, especially in the area with the most dynamic
economic growth (northeastern coastal zone). Reasons include: (a) the slow pace of construction
of industrial estates by the Agence Fonciere de l'Industrie (AFI), in part due to lengthy bidding
procedures governing the procurement of engineering consulting services; (b) the scarcity of
undeveloped land classified for industrial use; and (c) difficulties in private developers' access to
finance, as the cumbersome land titling system does not allow them to register the land in time to
make it available as collateral.")
34.    Legal and Regulatory Issues. Recent legal and regulatory reforms should be deepened to:
(a)    Facilitate company entry, operation, and exit, by (i) incorporating the concept of
corporate conglomerates in the revised Company Law to regulate a number of
corporate issues such as minority shareholders rights; (ii) reinforcing creditor
rights concerning collateral to facilitate access to finance; (iii) removing limits on
foreign direct investment in the offshore sector; (iv) accelerating the revision of
Bankruptcy Law and streamlining bankruptcy procedures; (v) introducing
explicitly electronic data transfer and credit card transactions in the Commercial
Code; and (vi) regulating franchising and factoring contracts, and updating the
Code des Obligations et des Contrats to reflect technological advances in
communications.
(b)    Improve enforcement capacity and the judicial system to handle business-related
issues, through measures such (i) strengthening training of magistrates, judges,
court registrars, and court reporters; (ii) improving access to legal information;
(iii) completing the reform of commercial arbitration; and (iv) strengthening
independent competition authorities.
(c)    Secure property rights, by updating the law on commercial, industrial and
intellectual property.
35.    The Government enacted a competition law in 1991 which was amended in 1995 and
1999. This law abolished margins on retail prices in 2000 and created a Competition Council.
The Council is still developing as an institution and so far has acted on only a very small number
of cases presented by the private sector and the Ministry of Commerce. It will be necessary, in
particular, to include experts in economics and other relevant fields to strengthen the capacity of
the Council to identify competition issues, make recommendations, and advise the Government
on any draft legislation related to competition.
36.    Public Sector Involvement. Public enterprises (PEs) are present in most economic
activities and dominant in banking, telecommunications, and transport, despite the fact that the
Government has increasingly been disengaging from economic activity. Many PEs have

12
performed poorly, with significant adverse impacts on the budget and on the banking sector. The
Bank has supported the Government's disengagement efforts since 1987." Under ECAL 1, a
more ambitious program of privatization and consolidation was initiated, and by the end of 1998,
95 public enterprises (including two large cement companies) had been privatized or liquidated,
with cumulative sales proceeds from privatization reaching TD 810 million (about
US$735 million at end-1998 exchange rate). Under ECAL II, the settlement of nonperforming
bank loans to public and semi-public enterprises amounted to TD 321 million (about US$255
million at end-1999 exchange rate) and involved 20 enterprises. Three of those enterprises were
liquidated under that operation, and others were restructured. The General Directorate of
Privatization (Direction Generale de la Privatisation or DGP) of the Ministry of Economic
Development lacks the resources to fulfill its mandate of monitoring privatized PEs, which may
become a critical issue as the Government embarks on its policy of granting concessions in the
infrastructure sector. A program to strengthen the DGP is being developed with the EU's
support.
B.2.   Government Program
37.    In order to address the constraints discussed above, the Government will follow a multi-
pronged approach for improving the private investment climate.
38.    Promoting Private Investment. The authorities intend to carry out an in-depth study of
the current policy framework and investment incentive regime to identify options to promote
private investment.
39.    Streamlining Administrative Procedures.  The Government is taking the following
actions to eliminate barriers to business startup and operation:
(a)    Tax administration.  The Government program includes several measures to
simplify tax procedures: (i) the new Code des Droits et Procedures Fiscaur is
expected to become effective on January 1, 2002, improving the transparency of
the relationship between firms and the tax administration, especially with respect
to tax controls; (ii) the VAT management is being streamlined by strengthening
the information and control system for VAT and accelerating VAT credit
reimbursement procedures for exporters to a maximum of 30 days; (iii) the
Ministry of Finance is training 2,800 agents in order to improve tax assessment
and collection; and (iv) measures will be adopted to provide incentives and
means to firms to increase the transparency and accurateness of financial
statements and tax declarations.12
(b)    Customs procedures for onshore enterprises. The Government program includes
implementation of the normalized, simplified administrative and trade
documentation for external trade transactions (liasse unique), reduction in the
number of customs documents, and implementation of an electronic system for
the payment of customs duties. In addition, customs procedures would be
significantly accelerated by clearing goods before arrival in ports. To reduce
steps and costs involved in trade transactions, Tunisie Trade Net's EDI system
will be interfaced with custom's SINDA.
'I The first Bank-supported program in 1987 focused on restructuring and privatizing small and medium-sized public
enterprises (mainly in textiles, tourism and construction) but was modest, leading to privatization or liquidation of
43 small enterprises.
12 Standards for tax control will be updated, and the authorities are planning to provide support and incentives to
SMEs in order to increase transparency and improve determination of their situation vis-a-vis taxation. The mise a
niveau program already provides an incentive to that end, as firms are compelled to provide certified financial
statements to receive subsidies.



13
(c)     Business startup procedures.    The Government has taken steps to streamline
business startup procedures further by eliminating 60 percent of all prior
authorizations. A presidential decree has also established the procedure unique
(single procedure) with an interlocuteur unique (single counterpart) for the
creation  of individual    enterprises  in  services  and  industry.    Regional
commissions have been set up to study files that require any prior authorization,
therefore speeding up the authorization process. The Government program also
involves extending the one-stop shop to the non-manufacturing sectors.
(d)   Access to industrial land.     To increase the supply of industrial land, the
authorities have decided to develop new industrial zones, including four zones in
the suburbs of Tunis in 2001.
40.     Improving Corporate Governance.       Drawing on recommendations from the November
2000 conference, the Government is implementing several measure to modernize its regulatory
framework and improve corporate governance and the competitive environment.
(a)     Enact updated laws on companies, holding companies, and conglomerates. In
November 2000, the Code de Commerce was revised, and the Code des Societes
Commerciales (Company Law) was promulgated. The draft law on corporate
conglomerates (Loi sur les groupes de societes) was also submitted to the
Chamber of Deputies recently. This will serve improve corporate governance by
providing a framework for future measures to strengthen minority shareholder
rights and defining clear taxation rules for groups.3 The accounting standards
will, in parallel, be updated to comply with international standards for the
treatment of holding companies and conglomerates.
(b)     Design and enforce the legislative framework governing bankruptcy.           The
Government has recently embarked on a process to revise provisions in
bankruptcy law to facilitate exit and protect creditors' rights.
(c)     Competition Council.     An action plan has been prepared to strengthen the
Competition Council and improve its ability to advise the Government on
competition issues.14
(d)     Public import monopolies. The Government plans to undertake a study to review
the functions of import monopolies (which represent some 40 percent of
consumer expenditures).
41.     Privatization. The following steps continue the Government's process of transforming
PEs into more financially sound and efficient entities.
13  The Code des Societes Commerciales (a) introduces new rules for the creation, management, transformation, and
mergers of companies; (b) puts together all legislative texts relating to securities without any major change;
(c) incorporates new concepts such as the Soci&td Unipersonnelle a Responsabilite' LimWite (in order to reduce risks for
sole entrepreneurs) and the Groupement d'Intdrdt Economique; and (d) revises the rules governing all socidids de
capitaux.
14  Key elements of the action plan: (a) financial autonomy of the Council for Competition; (b) restructuring of the
General Management for Competition and the services of the Economic Control in order to: (i) introduce missions and
studies relevant to competition, and distinct from active control activities; (ii) establish a specialized body of highly
qualified competence in cases and investigations on competition; (iii) establish a specialized unit to promote growing
public awareness of the rules and culture of competition, in response to the needs of the operators; (c) extend, in
accordance with the recommendations of the strategic study on commerce, the scope of the activities of the Price and
Supplies Observatory relative to the monitoring of the evolution of the market, in addition to monitoring the evolution
of the prices; (d) introduce training programs for personnel working with the competition authorities.



14
(a)    Opening the capital of major public enterprises. The Government Program
includes opening the capital of at least one large public enterprise to a strategic
investor.
(b)    Allowing private participation in key infrastructure sectors. The Government
plans to issue at least one large concession by the end of 2002. IMIore
importantly, the Govemment is currently preparing a private participation in
infrastructure (PPI) strategy with Bank support.
(c)    Continued disengagement from the banking sector. In line with its program,
supported under ECAL II, to disengage from the banking sector progressively,
the Government intends to withdraw fully from two commercial banks, and
examine alternatives for restructuring or privatizing the six development banks.
C.     FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
C.A.   Current Situation
42.    Banking sector. Financial intermediation in Tunisia is dominated by commercial banks,
which are also majority owners of many other financial institutions and assets, including leasing
companies, mutual funds, and other stock market assets. The Government retains close control of
the three largest public banks: Banque Nationale Agricole (agriculture), Banque de l'Habitat
(housing), and Societe Tunisienne de Banque (SMEs and PEs). Under a recent change in
Tunisian corporate law, corporations can replace their single board of directors (Conseil
d'Administration) with a dual board system composed of an executive management board
(Directoire), responsible for the day-to-day administration of the bank, and a supervisory board
(Conseil de Surveillance), which oversees management. This governance structure is based on
systems used in the EU and could provide more transparent governance of public banks.
43.    Banking sector soundness improved in the late 1990s, partly as a result of actions
supported under ECAL II related to PE debt restructuring and tighter prudential controls and
supervision. However, throughout the banking sector, the level of nonperforming loans (NPLs)
remains high (20 percent of GDP) compared to international standards and raises the cost of
financial intermediation. A significant percentage of NPLs are secured by real estate, exempting
them from provisioning requirements under BCT regulation. Although this practice is common
around the world, it is problematic in Tunisia because the judicial process for real estate
foreclosure can take several years, and some banks have been very slow to take action against
nonperforming borrowers whose loans are fully secured by real estate. As a result, a significant
amount of banks' assets are not producing income and not available for reinvestment in the
private sector. In addition, in order to avoid provisioning in the case of default, some banks
require borrowers to provide real estate collateral as a condition of obtaining even non-real estate
loans, creating a barrier to access to financing, especially for SMEs, which are less likely to have
such assets.
44.    Measures are needed to improve banks' lending decisions by encouraging them to rely
more on analysis of borrowers' repayment capacity and less on collateral-based lending. In order
to make this change, banks need access to reliable, transparent information on borrowers' credit
histories and financial situations. Banks should also be encouraged to act more quickly to
repossess real estate collateral, and in cases where foreclosure does not happen within a
reasonable timeframe, to protect against capital erosion by making additional provisions. In
recent years, banks have had an improved fiscal incentive to provision adequately because
provisions have been tax-deductible up to 75 percent of profits. This deduction was increased
from 50 percent to 75 percent under ECAL II.



15
45.    Capital markets. In recent years, the role and efficiency of the capital markets have been
enhanced by various policy measures, but Tunisian companies' recourse of to market finance
through equity and bond issues remains limited, despite the offer of strong fiscal incentives
(a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent). The primary constraints to
the development of the capital markets are: the cost of transparency and capital, the impact of
inter-related groups and cross-participations; financial culture; and the lack of specialized,
independent operators prepared to promote new products. Of the above, the most important and
most frequently cited constraint seems to be the cost of transparency that a public issue would
imply.
46.    Insurance Sector. Over the past decade, the insurance sector in Tunisia has grown in line
with the economy but remains underdeveloped compared to other countries. A robust insurance
sector is vital to the development of a strong financial system because insurance companies are
usually the largest institutional investors, stimulating capital markets development by providing
long-term resources for private investment. In addition, insurance companies provide a crucial
social safety net by protecting individuals and companies against financial losses due to accidents
or other crises.
47.    Certain past policies weakened the Tunisian insurance sector. First, regulated premiums
on compulsory motor third-party liability (MTPL) insurance were held constant for most of the
1990s despite increasing repair costs and court awards, creating operating deficits in the
automobile branch of the sector. Second, one company has been allowed to operate with
accumulated losses exceeding the combined total of its authorized capital and technical
provisions. This company drives down prices for the whole sector and is the most financially
troubled in the market. Third, the sector suffers from long settlement delays (an average of nearly
two years, with five years for MTPL), reflected in the high level of required technical provisions.
These delays are partly due to inefficiencies in the judicial system but also reflect inefficient
operations at the company level. Finally, certain companies with significant market share have
been operating with inadequate capital and provisions. Reform is therefore needed to allow the
Tunisian insurance sector to fulfill its social safety net function and to build financial depth in
order to stimulate capital market development in a meaningful way.
48.    Audits of the insurance companies were completed in early 2001 and show a substantial
shortfall in technical provisions for the two state-owned companies (one of which has since been
privatized) and the financially troubled company referred to above. An analysis of the audits
reveals that the total deficit of troubled companies is TD 160 million (about US$109 million).
This exceeds the total capital of the strong insurance companies, meaning that the insurance
sector as a whole operates with negative equity of TD 78 million (about US$53 million). Some
corrective measures, such as the appointment of a provisional administrator for the most
financially troubled company, have been taken. It is important to note that several private
companies do have strong balance sheets and sound prudential ratios.
49.    A potentially problematic development for the insurance industry is the decision to
mandate the transfer of basic group health insurance to the national social security entities. This
would deprive insurance companies of 20 percent of their business, although group health
insurance is only marginally profitable and the transfer is predicated on alleged social efficiency
grounds. Workers compensation insurance was transferred to the national social security fund in
1995, thereby addressing the chronic deficits of this compulsory personal line. Moreover, the tax
treatment of insurance was simplified, with more generous incentives for life insurance.
However, a clearer application of fiscal incentives for group contracts is needed to encourage the
growth of group life insurance.



16
C.2.   Government Program
50.    In order to ensure the availability of adequate financing for private investment, the
government is taking action to improve the efficiency of financial intermediation in the baiking
sector and capital markets and to strengthen the insurance sector. Tunisia recently participa:ed in
the joint Bank/IMF Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which should help determine
priority financial sector reform measures in the short and medium term.'5
51.    Improving the Efficiency of Financial Intermediation. The Government reform program
in the banking sector and capital markets aims to: (a) further strengthen bank soundness, (b)
improve the financial sector govemance, (c) improve information available to lenders, and (d)
encourage the development of a dynamic capital market.
(a)    Continuing Measures to Strengthen Bank Soundness.    Under ECAL I[. the
Government took actions and implemented new laws and regulations to improve
the quality of banks' loan portfolios and strengthen their financial viability, The
Government is now planning to reinforce those actions through the following
measures:
*   Amending the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedures to improve the
efficiency of certain judicial procedures related to realizing collateral
securing nonperforming loans. In addition, the Central Bank of Tunisia
(BCT) will conduct a study on the impact of these reforms and if necessary,
put in place measures to encourage credit institutions to foreclose -nore
rapidly on real estate securing NPLs.
*   Extending until at least 2006 the tax deductibility of loan loss provisions up
to 75 percent of profits, and making this deduction available to all credit
institutions (banks, leasing companies, and factoring companies). This
deduction, although potentially limited by a financial institution's
profitability, provides a fiscal incentive for banks to provision more
adequately'6.
*   Relaxing the conditions for writing off NPLs. Under current Tunisian law,
banks are only allowed to make tax-deductible write offs of NPLs meeting a
very strict set of conditions, leaving many NPLs on the balance sheet for
years after any realistic hope of repayment remains, thus inflating total assets
and distorting the image of banks' financial condition. The GoT is relaxing
write-off conditions, aligning them more closely with international pract:ces.
(b)    Improving Governance of the Financial Sector. The Govemment will put in
place dual board Directoire/Conseil de Surveillance structures at Scciete
Tunisienne de Banque and Banque Nationale Agricole. This structure could
allow public bank management to become more autonomous and make the
government's control of these institutions somewhat more "arm's-length".
15 FSAP missions were conducted in February and May 2001, and the final report is expected to be released to the
authorities in November 2001.
16 The tax deduction for loan loss provisions is currently set at 75 percent of banks' profits but is scheduled to revert
to the less desirable limit of 50 percent of banks' profits at the end of 2001.



17
(c)     Improving Information Available to Lenders. The Government is taking the
following actions to improve the transparency and reliability of information
about borrowers which is available to providers of financing:
*   Creating a record of individuals' credit histories at the BCT.
*   Requiring companies with significant debt to provide audited financial
statements (for companies with total financial sector debt exceeding TD 5
million) and to be listed on the stock exchange or be rated (for companies
with total financial sector debt exceeding TD 25 million).
*   Tightening risk concentration limits.  These measures will limit bank
exposure to a single client or group of clients17 and encourage portfolio
diversification and should also encourage large companies to seek financing
through the capital markets.
(d)    Promoting Securities Market Development. The CMF will carry out two studies,
one on its own organizational structure and information systems, and the other on
how to reinforce and expand the role of the financial markets in the Tunisian
economy. The CMF will then develop and implement an action plan based on
the recommendations of the two studies.
52.    Strengthening the Insurance Sector.     By restructuring the insurance sector, the
Government can reinforce an important social safety net and create a more dynamic group of
institutional investors for the economy. Areas to be strengthened include: legal and institutional
frameworks, auto insurance, life and personal insurance, treatment of financially distressed
insurance companies, and contractual savings mobilization.
(a)    Insurance Code. The Government is amending the Insurance Code, as well as
accounting rules, to upgrade the legislative, regulatory, and accounting
framework for the insurance sector. Prudential regulations will also be redefined
to bring them  more into line with international standards.   The proposed
amendments include the following measures:
*   Modification of the articles of the law relating to minimum capital and
establishment of a solvency margin specific to life insurance;
*   Establishment of a list of clear rules for the computation of technical
provisions (reserves) as well as their coverage by specific assets ("arr&e" of
the Minister of Finance);
*   Introduction of on-site and off-site supervision of insurance companies
without the requirement of a preliminary authorization (Ordre de Mission) by
the Minister.
(b)    Institutional Framework.   The General Directorate of Insurance (Direction
Gen&rale des Assurances or DGA) has adopted a new organizational structure
that will place strong emphasis on the efficient discharge of its supervisory
functions, with a clear separation between the Government's functions as (a)
supervisor of the sector and (b) owner of state insurance companies.
17 The total amount of commitments must not exceed (i) five times the bank's net capital, for all clients having
commitments equal to or greater than 5 percent of the bank's net capital, and (ii) two times the bank's net capital, for
all clients having commitments equal to or greater than 15 percent of the bank's net capital.



18
(c)    Auto Insurance. Planned measures to improve auto insurance should make this
branch more efficient and more profitable:
*   Implementing a system of settlement of claims based on objective criteria";
*   Establishing a system of tariff schedules and increasing auto insurance rates
over the period 2001-2002.
(d)    Life and Personal Insurance. New legislation is being adopted to improve the
definitions, accounting treatment, and calculation rules for various types of life
and personal insurance. The treatment of fiscal and social charges for group
insurance rates will also be modified. These measure should ensure more
equitable treatment of the insured and encourage the growth of this insurance
branch.
(e)  Treatment of Undercapitalized and Under-reserved Companies.    In order to
improve the overall soundness of the sector and to prevent insolvent companies
from operating in ways which distort the market, the Government is developing
scenarios to restructure the troubled companies.
(f)  Contractual Savings Mobilization.    In  addition  to the  authorization  of
bancassurance, the fiscal treatment of life insurance premia will be clarified.
These measures are likely to provide a major boost to the development of
contractual savings through the promotion of group life insurance policies and the
creation of company pension plans. In the long term, better protection of the
interests of policyholders and members of pension plans will encourage the
development of a long-term annuity market and contribute to the mobilization of
long-term contractual savings.
D.     INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
D.I.   Current Situation
53.    The information and communication technologies (ICT) sector is playing an increasingly
important role in Tunisia's economic competitiveness, for two main reasons: (a) efficient and
competitive telecommunications is critical to a modem and open economy, and (b) the ICT sector
itself can serve as an engine of growth and employment generation.'9 During the past two years,
Tunisia has made substantial progress in establishing a coherent policy and regulatory framework
conducive to growth and employment generation in the ICT sector, and the Government has
taken several steps to reform the ICT sector. However, the range, quality, and price of ICT
services could be much more competitive, alleviating a constraint to private sector development
(Table 4).
54.    Most telecommunications services (local, long distance, and international fixed and
cellular voice services) in Tunisia are provided on a monopoly basis by Tunisie Telecom (TT), a
public enterprise with limited financial and operational independence from the Ministry of
Communication Technologies (Ministere des Technologies de la Communication or MTC). The
lack of competitive pressure has led to delays in service provision and limited service innovation.
The monopoly in basic services has affected both the availability and prices of services. TT's
monopoly situation allows it to maximize prices on GSM services and to charge leased-line prices
18 The system would include measures such as the creation of a claims settlement system distinguishing between the
rules applicable to the driver and to others; the use of specialized doctors to appraise claim-related injuries; and the
definition of the notion of third party to make it broader, ensure equity among victims, reduce delays in paying claims,
and set the rules of interaction between social security and the insured for auto claims and work-related accidents.

that are higher than international benchmarks; this hampers the development of many
telecommunications services, particularly data, internet, and value-added services, and limits the
potential for private or independent networks because private corporations cannot bypass TT.
55.     Fixed-line services are well developed, with over one million lines at the end of 2000.
This brings fixed line penetration above many regional benchmarks (see Table 4). This network
expansion is coupled by an increase in productivity (from 105 to 150 lines per employee in the
last two years). Mobile services have grown to more than 370,000 GSM subscribers. However,
mobile service penetration (3.7 percent) is low compared to other emerging economies (such as
Chili, Morocco and Malaysia), which have brought penetration closer to OECD levels. Data and
internet services have been marginally liberalized: TT, through the Agence Tunisienne de
l'Internet (ATI), operates the backbone network, over which value added, data, and internet
services are offered by a small number of private providers. Bottlenecks in the data segment are
demonstrated by the fact that Tunisia is one of the few countries in which the number of top-level
internet hosts has decreased in recent years. In addition the absolute number of hosts in the
country is far from average international levels. In terms of service quality, network reliability
has improved, since the fault rate (number of faults per 100 lines per year) has decreased from 60
to 27 percent between 1997 and 2001. In fact, other emerging economies (e.g., the Philippines),
have brought the fault rate close to OECD standards (4-5 percent). Customer assistance has
improved, and more than 85 percent of faults are now repaired within 48 hours, according to the
MTC.

56.     To close the gap in sector performance with other emerging economies, there is
consensus from the Government and the private sector that the ICT sector, particularly
telecommunications, should be opened to competition and private participation. This, in turn,
will require the deepening of present ICT reforms to ensure:
(a)     more    regulatory    independence      for   the    Instance   Nationale     des
Telecommunications (INT);
(b)     a clearer interconnection regime for a competitive multi-operator environment:
(c)     communication to investors of a liberalization timetable to signal the sustained
commitment of the Government to the introduction of competition;



20
(d)    better enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPR), notwithstanding the
presence of a good legal framework for IPR protection (software as well
content);
(e)    fewer restrictions on the development and hosting of web activities and the
development of digital content in Tunisia; and
(f)    minimized regulation for service provision, especially with respect to new
services which can be provided by the private sector on a fully competitive basis
(such as call centers and tele-services).
D.2.   Government Program
57.    The main axes of the Government's ICT sector reform are: (a) development of a new
sector policy, as well as legal and regulatory framework for telecommunications, to encourage
competition and private participation; (b) introduction of effective competition in
telecommunications; and (c) establishment of a regulatory framework for electronic commerce,
including certification of electronic transactions.
58.    Telecommunications Policy and Legal and Regulatory Framework. The Government
program builds on the progress initiated by the Telecommunications Code (Code des
Communications) of 2000, to encourage effective liberalization of the telecommunications sector.
The Code allows for the entry of licensed operators into all market segments (fixed and cellular
voice, data, internet, etc.) in competition with TT. The following implementation regulations for
the Telecommunications Code have been promulgated: (a) interconnection decree; (b) rights of
way decree; (c) telecommunication equipment certification decree; and (d) arrete on numeration.
These represent fundamental steps towards creating an adequate regulatory framework for
telecommunication in an open and liberalized environment.
59.    By end 2002, the Government also plans to introduce implementing regulations in the
following areas: (a) radio frequency planning and regulation and (b) tariff rebalancing and price
regulation, with a view to establishing clear, cost-oriented rules to determine telecommunications
end-user charges. In parallel, TT is expected to introduce cost accounting by 2003.
60.    The Government program also involves increasing the independence of the regulatory
agencies. The Telecommunications Code established a frequency agency (Agence Nationale des
Frequences or ANF) under the MTC, as well as TNT, an independent regulatory body for
telecommunications. The INT' s President and commissioners have been appointed.  An
amendment to the Code des Communications is expected to be introduced by mid 2002 to
increase TNT's autonomy.
61.    Effective Competition in ICT. The Government plans to introduce a second GSM
operator and increase the number of internet service providers (ISPs). The GSM transaction, in
particular, is expected to change the telecommunications landscape. The licensed operator should
become a strong competitor to Tr, as it will: (a) have the possibility to build and lease its own
long distance infrastructure network, up to the point of interconnection; (b) offer international
services to its own clients, as soon as commercial launch date; and (c) have freedom to set prices.
In addition, the Government will publish its timetable for sector liberalization, thereby clarifying
its commitment to introduce effective competition in the various segments of the sector in the
medium term (2002-2006). By reducing the regulatory and policy risk faced by investors, the
publication of the liberalization calendar should contribute to enhanced revenues from new
licenses.



21
62.    Regulatory Framework for Electronic Commerce and Certification of Electronic
Trantsactions. Tunisia is very advanced, compared with other countries in North Africa, in terms
of establishment of a regulatory framework for electronic transactions. The Government has
recently (August 2000) enacted the e-commerce law (Loi relative aux echanges et au commerce
electronique), introducing regulations for digital signature and certification of electronic
transactions, and establishing the Agence Nationale de Certification Electronique (ANCE). The
implementation decrees for the e-commerce law were approved, including the regulation and
standards for the certification of electronic transactions.
IV. BUILDING ON PREVIOUS OPERATIONS
63.    The proposed operation is the third in a series of operations aimed at improving the
international competitiveness of the Tunisian economy following the signing of the AAEU.
ECAL I supported a broad liberalization agenda with measures aimed at (a) strengthening the
macroeconomic framework in anticipation of forgone trade tax revenue and (b) preparing the
domestic economy for increased competition in local and export markets. ECAL II focused on
strengthening the banking sector to increase its effectiveness in supporting the domestic
economy, as well as preparing the sector for the future opening of financial services to external
competition.20
64.    The Bank's evaluation of ECAL      I21 indicates that Tunisia made considerable
improvements in macroeconomic performance during 1996-1997, allowing the country to borrow
on the U.S. dollar Euromarket for the first time in 1997. Progress on tariff reduction was also
significant, and Tunisia achieved AAEU ratification in 1997. The Government's disengagement
program resulted in the sale of about 60 firms, including two large cement producers which
brought a total price of over US$400 million. However, although OED evaluators agreed that
progress had been made in privatization, they stated that it was not clear that the "state's role in
commercial sectors had been substantially reduced". Despite ECAL I's success, two technical
waivers and one partial waiver were required in order to make the release of the second tranche
possible, and little progress was made in reforming the shipping and telecommunications sectors.
The post evaluations highlighted the need for more focused adjustment lending, complemented
by technical assistance and grounded in solid economic and sector work, as well as the need to
collaborate more closely with other key development partners.
65.    ECAL II was more narrowly targeted at upgrading the performance of the financial sector
and of the banking sector in particular. In addition to the settlement of public and semi-public
enterprises' NPLs, which composed a significant part of the overall reduction of NPLs from 1997
to 1999, the authorities privatized, liquidated, or restructured many PEs so as to prevent the
recurrence of significant bad debt in that sector. Legal and regulatory reforms made under the
ECAL II program also supported modernization of the financial sector. The longer term impacts
of ECAL II have yet to be assessed, but preliminary evaluations indicate that, coupled with the
accompanying analytical work carried out in the context of the Private Sector Assessment
20 ECAL I (Loan Nos. 40690 and 40691) was a 2-tranche operation of USS75 million with parallel financing of
US$120 million by the EU. The loan was approved on July 25, 1996, made effective on December 6, 1996, and closed
on June 30, 1998. ECAL II (Loan 44610) was a 2-tranche operation of US$159 million, approved on April 20, 1999,
with parallel financing consisting of a grant of EURO 80 million from the EU and a loan of US$140 million from the
AiDB.
21 For more information, see the ECAL I Implementation Completion Report dated 12-29-98 (Report No. 18752)
and the OED Project Evaluation Report dated 6-23-99.



Update, the operation substantially increased the BorTower's overall understanding of, and
proactivity in, strengthening the banking sector.
66.    Lessons drawn from both prior operations have been incorporated into the proposed
ECAL III. First, underlying work (including a Private Sector Assessment Update, an ICT
Strategy, and a Structural and Social Sector Review) has provided the analytical foundation and a
solid basis for internal consensus-building within Tunisia and has been integrated into the
preparation of ECAL III. Second, a targeted sectoral approach has been chosen for each floating
tranche. Finally, coordination efforts with other donors have led to the use of a common matrix
of policy measures with the EU and AfDB. In sum, the preparation of a coordinated, focused,
and analytically well-supported operation has strengthened the Bank's dialogue with the
Borrower and its development partners, especially with regard to reforms in the
telecommunications and insurance sectors.
V.     PROPOSED LOAN
A.     LOAN RATIONALE AND THE CAS
67.    The 2000-02 CAS recognizes that further and bolder refonns are needed to strengthen
Tunisia's external competitiveness and macroeconomic framework. In this regard, the program
of refonns supported by the proposed loan are essential steps for the Government to meet its
growth and employment targets over the 1 0"' Plan period while completing the implementation of
the AAEU. Thus, in line with the CAS, ECAL III will support refonns to: (i) enhance the private
investment climate by improving the business environment and corporate governance and
developing private sector participation in infrastructure via concessions and further privatization
of state enterprises; (ii) deepen Tunisia's financial sector by further strengthening banking
regulation, accelerating the development of capital markets, and reforming the insurance sector;
(iii) improve ICT regulation and private provision of telecommunications services; and (iv)
strengthen further the macroeconomic framework and management.
68.    While support from the Bank and co-financiers for these reforms represents only about
10 percent of Tunisia's external financing needs, it is expected to give a positive signal to
financial markets and foreign investors. This signal is especially important in a context where the
countly's balance of payments continues to be vulnerable to structural changes and shocks in the
external environment. Under the assumption that there will not be a major unforeseen downturn
in the existing extemal environment or a significant tightening in the country's access to
international financial markets, Tunisia's financing needs for the next two years, though relatively
important, are likely to be met without major difficulties. In 2001, out of a total financing need
estimated at US$1.95 billion, the proposed loan will directly contribute about US$132.5 million
(through its first tranche), and parallel financing from the AfDB will contribute about an
additional US$97 million. In 2002, out of a total financing need projected at US$2.6 billion, the
proposed loan is likely to contribute US$120 million, and parallel financing from the AfDB and
the European Union will contribute about US$97 million and US$72 million equivalent
respectively. With the proposed loan, the IBRD lending portfolio will be in line the base case
lending scenario outlined in the CAS.
69.    As per the CAS, a temporary tightening of extemal financial markets or a slow-down in
export receipts due to regional or global uncertainty would warTant a high lending scenario. If
indeed the September 1 lt' telTorist attacks and their aftermath were to have dire consequences on
the global economy, the financing needs of Tunisia would likely be higher, and more importantly,



23
the ability of the country to mobilize financing from private international financial markets would
likely be much curtailed, possibly requiring additional lending from the Bank. Thus far, Tunisia
has weathered external shocks (the Gulf War, instability in neighboring countries, severe
droughts, tightening of financial markets following the East Asia crisis) reasonably well.
However, global and regional uncertainties, combined with Tunisia's rather strong dependence on
tourism receipts and workers' remittances, mean that for the foreseeable future it would be
important for the Bank and other donors to increase assistance levels in the face of an external
shock. In such a situation, the Bank may positively consider a request from the authorities to
temporarily increase its lending to the levels foreseen under the high lending case. In doing so,
the Bank would coordinate with the IMF to ensure that an appropriate macroeconomic framework
and required macroeconomic policy adjustments are in place.
B.     LOAN AMOUNT, TRANCHING AND KEY ACTIONS
70.   In response to the above challenges and higher uncertainty that Tunisia has to face in the
international environment, the operation design has been revised to strengthen macroeconomic
conditionality, increase the amount of the loan as compared to the CAS projection, and offer
tranching arrangements that provide more flexibility for Tunisia to access Bank funds. The
proposed loan, in the amount of EURO 281 million (US$252.5 million equivalent), will be made
to the Republic of Tunisia in the form of an adjustment loan to be disbursed in one standard first
tranche of EURO 144.69 million (US$130 million equivalent), a capitalized front-end fee of
EURO 2.81 million (US$2.5 million equivalent), and three equal floating tranches of EURO 44.5
million (US$40 million equivalent), linked to reforms, respectively, in the areas of private
investment climate, financial sector, and information and communication technologies. The
proposed structure is designed to allow the Tunisians more flexibility in accelerating
implementation of the reform program in selected areas (telecommunications may be the best
candidate), thus giving the Government the possibility to disburse the loan more quickly, if
needed.
71.    First Tranche. The Govemment has carried out a series of actions which constitute the
basis for the disbursement of the first tranche of US$130 million equivalent expected to take
place at end-December 2001. These measures are detailed in Annex II, and some key actions are
highlighted below.
(a) Macroeconomicframework. The Government has:
* Maintained a stable macroeconomic framework, meeting the indicators set out in Table 3.
* Put in place a unified, computerized database on foreign public and private debt.
* Published the Decree establishing the CNF.
(b) Private Investment Climate. The Government has:
*  Prepared the terms of reference for a study on promotion of and incentives for private
investment.
*  Submitted the draft law amending the Code des Droits et des Procedures Fiscaux to the
Chamber of Deputies.
*  Presented the draft Law on Corporate Conglomerates to the Chamber of Deputies.
*  Adopted an action plan to reinforce the institutional framework for competition.



24
(c) Financial Sector. The Government has:
*   Submitted to the Chamber of Deputies draft amendments to the Civil and Commercial
Procedures Code relating to loan recoveries.
*   Adopted a BCT regulation requiring auditors' certification of financial statements and
mandatory rating or stock market listing for all corporations with debt exceeding
specified limits.
*   Launched studies on (i) the development of capital markets and (ii) the organization and
information systems of the CMF.
*   Submitted a draft law amending the Insurance Code to the Chamber of Deputies.
*   Increased auto insurance rates (civil responsibility) by at least 8 percent.
*  Presented technically acceptable restructuring scenarios, which exclude all prior use of
resources from the Guarantee Fund, for the most troubled insurance company in the
Tunisian market.
(d) Information and Communication Technologies. The Govemment has:
*   Adopted key implementation regulations for the new Telecommunications Code.
*   Adopted the Law conceming exchanges and electronic commerce.
*   Launched an international bidding process for the granting of a second GSM license,
including the selection of an investment bank of intemational reputation to assist the
authorities in granting this license.
72.    Floating Tranches.   The release of each of the three floating tranches would be
conditioned on: (i) the maintenance of a stable macro-economic framework, which will be
monitored based on the performance indicators outlined in Table 3 ;22 (ii) progress on the
implementation of reforms in each of the three areas of the program; and (iii) the following
specific actions linked to each tranche and covenanted in the Loan Agreement:
(a) Private Investment Climate.
*   Finalization of the study on private sector investment promotion and incentives and
adoption of an action plan based on the recommendations of the study.
*   Adoption of regulations required for the implementation of the Code des Droits et des
Procedures Fiscaux.
*   Adoption of regulations required for the implementation of the Company Law and
publication of new accounting standards relating to the consolidation of financial
statements and the treatrnent of corporate conglomerates.
*   Offering for sale, through a competitive and transparent bidding process, of all public
shares in UIB and Banque du Sud.
*   Offering for sale, through a competitive and transparent bidding process, of at least 25
percent of shares in one large public enterprise to a strategic investor.
*   Finalization of a study on the reform of public import monopolies.
22 The evaluation of macroeconomic developments in the country as they relate to the loan will benefit from data and
other information that the authorities will send to the Bank on a quarterly basis. In case of marked deviations from the
macroeconomic framework agreed upon with the Borrower, the Bank, in consultation with the IMF, will initiate
discussions with the Tunisian authorities in order to identify the causes of deviations and the most appropriate policy
responses.



25
(b) Financial Sector.
*  Finalization of a study on foreclosure of real estate collateral and adoption of any new
necessary measures to accelerate the recovery of loans and the foreclosure of real estate
collateral by credit institutions.
*  Putting in place the human resources and equipment necessary for the DGA to exercise
its supervisory function, in accordance with the Action Plan.
*  Adoption of a regulation providing for a 3 percent increase in auto insurance premium
rates, and adoption of a medium-term action plan with the objective of eliminating the
deficit of the automobile branch of the insurance sector.
*  Submission to the Chamber of Deputies of draft amendments to Laws 60-21 and 62-23
with the objective of revising the system of indemnification in automobile insurance.
*  Launching of the restructuring of the most troubled insurance company; agreement
between the DGA and three undercapitalized, under-provisioned insurance companies on
corrective plans to meet capital and provisioning requirements.
(c) Telecommunications and Information Technology.
*  Adoption and publication of a liberalization timetable, for the period of 2002-2006;
selection of an investment bank with a view to launching the bidding process for at least
one V-SAT license.
*  Submission to the Chamber of Deputies of a draft law amending the Telecommunications
Code to strengthen the autonomy of INT.
*  Granting of the second GSM license through a competitive and transparent bidding
process; publication of a standard interconnection offer.
C.     FISCAL IMPACT
73.    The medium to long-term fiscal impact of the measures supported by the loan is likely to
be positive and large. Most importantly, the loan will contribute to the medium to long-term
objective of improving the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy and will help Tunisian firms
expand more easily and more rapidly, generating larger profits and thus more fiscal revenues in
the form of corporate taxes. The measures envisaged in the operation will also contribute to
higher economic growth and higher personal incomes and will therefore expand the income tax
base.
74.    Regarding the short-term fiscal impact, the measures included in the policy reform matrix
supported by the operation can be divided in three broad categories:
* The first category is made up of measures which entail a small short-term fiscal cost
either due to increased expenditures required to improve the efficiency of the
Administration, or reduced fiscal revenues so as to reduce counterproductive taxation.
Such measures include the creation of the CNF, the establishment of an interface between
Tunisia Trade Net and SINDA, acceleration of the reimbursement of VAT credits to
firms, extension to 2006 of the fiscal deduction for loan loss provision up to 75 percent of
profits, reduction of the time required before a NPL can be written off, institutional
strengthening of the DGA, fiscal deductions for group insurance, and the creation of the
INT and ANF. It is important to stress that the medium to long-term positive fiscal
impact of all these measures is likely to outweigh the short-term fiscal cost.



26
*  The second category includes measures that entail generally significant short-term
positive fiscal impacts as they would generate important revenues for the government
budget. This category includes the sale of a second GSM license, privatization of banks
(UIB and Banque du Sud), opening of the capital of a large public enterprise, and
issuance of a data transmission license (V-SAT).
*  The third category includes measures which entail no direct fiscal impact but either help
reduce contingent liabilities (and thus reduce the risk that fiscal expenditures may
increase in the future on account of risks born by the Government budget) or improve
transparency and market efficiency. These measures include the improvement of
information on external debt and the adoption of an active debt management strategy,
implementation of a new fiscal code, adoption of a new company law, adoption of a new
law and new accounting rules for groups and conglomerates, creation of a credit history
database to facilitate credit checks, the requirement that companies should have audited
financial statements and be publicly traded or have a rating if their debt exceeds a certain
threshold, and the adoption of a new credit concentration ratio.
D.     BENEFITS AND RISKS
75.    The benefits of the proposed loan include: (a) enhancement of Tunisia's prospects to
meet its ambitious growth, investment, and employment targets for the 10i Development Plan
period (2002-2006) by accelerating its competitiveness program while maintaining a prudent
level of foreign exchange reserves in an uncertain external environment; (b) development of a
more transparent private investment climate, with continued state disengagement from the
economy; and (c) improvement of the efficiency of the financial and telecommunications sectors.
The combined effect of the above will have a positive impact on private sector competitiveness
and economic growth, thus contributing to employment generation and poverty alleviation. t^Jther
benefits expected to accrue to citizens will include improved access to financial products such as
insurance, and a greater range of telecommunication services.
76.    There are, however, risks to the proposed operation. A sudden worsening of international
economic or security conditions could slow reform and propel short-term macroeconomic
stabilization to the top of Tunisia's economic agenda. There is a risk of slow implementation due
to the need to consult with labor unions to implement certain insurance sector reforms. Finally,
the effective introduction of competition in the telecommunications sector may take more time
than projected, in light of the relatively tight financial situation of most operators worldwide.
77.    Several actions are being considered to reduce the potential risks facing the operation.
The Bank and the authorities recognize that additional financing may be required from the Bank
and other sources to alleviate the potential macroeconomic effects and social impacts of further
external shocks in 2002. Moreover, the risk of a slowdown in the reform program following an
unexpected deterioration of the international economic or security environment is limited for the
following reasons. First, the authorities have identified additional macroeconomic stabilization
measures to be put in place if needed. Second, Tunisia has an established record of commitment
to structural reforms. Finally, the proposed loan structure of three floating tranches will allow the
Government to disburse a specific tranche once reforms have been implemented in a single
sector, rather than waiting for completion of all reforms covered by the program. This flexibility
will be especially helpful if faster disbursement is required due to additional pressures on the
country's balance of payments. Further incentive to implement the reform program is provided
by parallel financing, based on the same policy reform matrix, from the AfDB and the EU. In
addition, to reduce the social impact of competitive pressures, the authorities are launching an
employment study, with support from the Bank, to look into avenues for increasing the
economy's employment generation capacity even in the face of increased external competition.



27
With regard to reforms in the insurance sector, the Government's gradual approach based on
careful, though time-consuming, intemal consensus-building presents a risk of delay rather than
non-completion of the planned measures; this risk is also mitigated by the floating tranche
structure. In telecommunications, the authorities' open and transparent selection process for the
second GSM operator represents the best guarantee to attract sound proposals from qualified
bidders.
E.     ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS
78.    Environment. Tunisia's legal and environmental regulatory framework for environment
is strong. In the context of any privatization activities under the loan, the authorities have
undertaken to (i) screen PEs which are being sold to determine past environmental liabilities and
(ii) assign responsibility for those liabilities and define the measures needed to tackle them, in
accordance with regulations in force in Tunisia. The Ministere de l'Environnement et de
l'Amenagement du Territoire is responsible for the enforcement of these measures and for the
enforcement of environmental legislation once a privatization has taken place.
79.    Social Safeguards. No social safeguard issues are expected to arise from this operation,
but the foreseen compulsory increase in motor vehicle insurance premiums will have an impact
on the costs incurred by the insured. However, as measures proposed in the insurance sector are
likely to result in the offering of improved products and services to consumers by companies
under stronger competitive pressure, insured individuals are also likely to benefit from speedier
settlement of insurance claims, and reforms should result in a net gain in this area. The direct
impact of the reforms on employment cannot be calculated at this stage. The Government,
however, is undertaking a study with the support of the Bank to identify sources of employment
growth. Tunisia's past handling of changes in employment patterns has been prudent, sensitive,
and aimed at minimizing hardships, and no major negative social impacts are expected as a result
of the operation.
F.     DISBURSEMENT, FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND AUDITING
80.    The disbursement of funds under ECAL III will follow  the Bank's simplified
disbursement procedures for structural adjustment operations. The proceeds of the loan in the
amount of EURO 281 million (US$252.5 equivalent) will be disbursed in one standard first
tranche of EURO 144.69 million (US$130 million equivalent), a capitalized front-end fee of
EURO 2.81 million (US$2.5 million equivalent), and three equal floating tranches of
EURO 44.5 million (US$40 million equivalent) against satisfactory implementation of the
adjustment program in specific areas. In accordance with the Operational Directive on the
Simplification of Disbursement Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sectoral Adjustment
Loans (February 8, 1996), disbursement will not be linked to any specific purchases, and no
procurement requirements will be needed. Upon notification by the Bank of the effectiveness of
the loan, the proceeds of the first tranche will be deposited by IBRD in an deposit account (DA)
opened at the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) at the request of the Borrower. The Borrower will
open and maintain a DA in the BCT to receive the proceeds of the adjustment loan and will
comply with the contractual provisions of the Loan Agreement and related documents.
Subsequent tranches will be deposited in the same account once the agreed conditions are met. If,
after deposit in this account, the proceeds of the loan are used for ineligible purposes as defined in
the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to (a) either return the amount to the
account for future use for eligible purposes or (b) refund the amount directly to IBRD, in which
case the Bank will cancel an equivalent amount from the loan.



28
81.    The administration of the loan will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Intemational
Cooperation and Investment, which will ensure that all withdrawals from the DA are for budgeted
expenditures and not for purposes such as military expenditures or for other items on the Bank's
negative list. The BCT will maintain records of all transactions under the loan in accordance with
best accounting practices. The Borrower will be required to submit to the Bank regular reports on
the withdrawal of funds in local currency from the DA, producing evidence that the said sum was
paid into a treasury account used to fund budgetary expenditures.
82.    Specifically, the borrower will:
* open and maintain a DA in the BCT to receive the proceeds of the adjustment loan;
* comply with the contractual provisions of the Loan Agreement and related documents;
* indicate to the Bank details of the Government bank account to which the local currency
equivalent of the loan proceeds will be credited. This account will be subject to budget
control;
* ensure that all withdrawals from the deposit account are for budgeted expenditures, and
not for purposes such as military expenditures or for other items on the Bank's negative
list;
*  submit to the Bank for each tranche, starting with the first tranche of the loan and ending
with the last tranche, a report showing: (i) the receipt of the tranche in question and (ii) its
transfer and deposit in local currency into a treasury account used to fund budgetary
expenditures. The final report will show that the balance on the DA has been reduced to
zero.
83.    The Borrower will also appoint independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank to carry out
the loan audits. The audits will be conducted at the end of the first year following the
disbursement of the first tranche, and each ensuing year until the closing date of the loan. The
audits shall be carried out in accordance with the terms of reference agreed between the Bank and
the Borrower. The audit will certify that funds disbursed have been received by the BCT and are
subject to its normal policies and controls, and that the local currency equivalent of these
proceeds has been paid into an account subject to normal budgetary policies, procedures and
controls. The closing date of the proposed loan will be June 30, 2003.
G.     COFINANCING
90.    The loan is being co-financed by an AfDB loan for EURO 216 million equivalent and by
European Union grant for EURO 80 million on the basis of the matrix of policy measures found
in Annex II.
H.     BANK ExPosuRE
91.    The proposed IBRD loan and the related parallel financing would not significantly affect
Tunisia's debt and exposure indicators. Tunisia's excellent record of servicing its external debt
and its solid export receipts allow for a reasonable level of confidence that the proposed loan
would be adequately serviced, without tying down an inordinate share of the country's resources.
The debt-to-GDP ratio will increase from 55 percent in 2000 to 57 percent in 2001 due to a
combination of market borrowing and acceleration in the disbursement of official loans.
However, the ratio is projected to decline during the period 2002-04 (see Annex VI). The debt
service ratio, which increased markedly in 2000 due to the reimbursement of maturing sovereign
bonds (the Samurai Bonds II and III), will decline to 16 percent in 2001 and maintain a declining
trend until 2003, before temporarily increasing in 2004 due further maturing sovereign bonds.



29
92.   IBRD's exposure will improve during the period 2001-04. First, the preferred creditors'
share in total public debt service is projected to remain fairly high; however, it will be lower than
in previous years (averaging 41.4 percent during 2001-04 compared to 46.5 percent during 1996-
2000). Second, good export performance has helped keep the ratio of IBRD debt service to
exports receipts at levels far below the indicative 5 percent. In fact, the ratio is projected to be
below 3 percent during 2001-04. Third, IBRD debt service as a share of public debt service will
remain below 20 percent. From an average of 18.9 percent during 1996-2000, the ratio will
decline to an average of 16.2 percent during 2001-04 (this average is higher than the 2000 level
because the ratio was exceptionally low that year due to the high debt service to private lenders
due to the repayment of Samurai Bonds as mentioned above). Fourth, IBRD's share in total debt
will average 11.7 percent during 2001-04 down from 12.6 percent during 1996-2000.
VI.    RECOMMENDATION
93.    I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
