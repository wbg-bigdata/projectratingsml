1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1        Context at Appraisal

1.     The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) prepared the Sustainable Development and
Poverty Reduction Program-2002 (SDPRP) to address the development challenges facing
Ethiopia at the turn of the twenty first century. This plan, along with subsequent policy
documents, 1 underscores the need to make substantial investments in infrastructure as a
means to create opportunities for diversified and inclusive growth.

2.     Transport infrastructure plays a vital role in facilitating economic development in
Ethiopia. In particular, road transport provides the predominant means for movement of
people, utilization of land and natural resources, improved agricultural production and
marketing, access to social services, and opportunities for sustainable growth. Road
transport accounts for 95 percent of the country’s passenger and freight traffic and is the
only means of access to rural communities. In spite of the relative importance of road
transport, the condition of the infrastructure at appraisal was poor. Therefore, improving
the quality and extent of road infrastructure was rightly considered a priority for the GoE.
By the end of the twentieth century, Ethiopia’s classified road network as measured by
density and quality was severely inadequate to meet the growth aspirations of the
country 2.

3.      To address the constraints in the road sector the GoE formulated the Road Sector
Development Program (RSDP) in 1997. RSDP is a multi-phased program 3 supported by
contributions from various development partners. The overall aim of RSDP is to restore
the essential road network and create adequate capacity in the road sector 4.

4.      The World Bank support to RSDP was designed as a four stage Adaptable
Program Loan (APL 1-4). The goal of the APL stages was to provide sustained support to
the RSDP. APL1 which started in June 2003 was a US$126.8million IDA Grant designed
to assist the GoE in improving the quality of priority federal roads, strengthen road sector
reforms and enable private sector participation in the road sector. APL2 (US$160.9
million IDA Credit) was designed to build on APL1.

5.      The rationale for World Bank’s involvement in APL2 was the continuation of
support provided through APL1 and the subsequent stages (i.e. APL 3 and APL 4). The
World Bank also had the potential to add value to RSDP by drawing on
international/regional experience in similar programs. At the time of preparation for
APL2, the World Bank was also providing road sector reform assistance in the region and

and Transformation Plan (GTP) 2010-2015

  At appraisal the road network was estimated to include 33,000 km - 16,000 km classified as federal and 17,000 km as regional roads.
Only 12 percent of the road network was paved
3
  The first RSDP was officially launched in September 1997 and ended in 2002. RSDP II started in 2002 and ended in 2007. The third
phase (RSDP III) commenced in July 2007 and ended in June 2010. The fourth phase (RSDP IV) commenced in July 2010 and will
end in 2015

  Assessment of 14 Years Performance of the Road Sector Development Program, ERA Nov 2011

                                                                 1
could therefore create an appropriate framework to shape the implementation and
monitoring. The World Bank’s participation could therefore support long term road
development in Ethiopia and contribute to economic growth aspirations of the GoE.

1.2       Original Program Objectives

6.     The primary objective of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) 5 is to provide
support to restore and expand Ethiopia’s road network in order to reduce poverty and
increase employment through promoting growth and access in a socially and
environmentally sustainable manner.

Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) of APL2 and Key Indicators

7.      The objectives of APL2 (the project) 6 as outlined in the Project Appraisal
Document were to increase the road transport infrastructure and improve its reliability;
strengthen the capacity for road construction, management and maintenance; and create
conditions conducive to private sector participation in the road transport sector. These
objectives were to be achieved through: (a) construction, rehabilitation, upgrading and
preserving the priority federal and regional road network; (b) strengthening of Ethiopia
Road Authority (ERA) reform program; (c) developing the capacity in program
implementation; and (d) improving rural travel and transport services.

8.      According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the key project indicators
against which the project was to be measured were:

     Increase road density from 30.8 km/1000 sq. km in 2003 to 36.24 km/1000 sq. km by
      2009.

     Increase proportion of roads in good condition from 32 percent in 2003 to 50 percent
      by 2009.

     Improve the social, environmental, economic and planning management capacity of
      the clients.

     Enable ERA District Maintenance Organizations (DMOs) to operate as profit centers
      by July 2005 and commercial centers by July 2006.

     Increase the share (percentage) of periodic maintenance (in value terms) contracted
      on a competitive basis to domestic contractors.

     Increase the share (percentage) of routine maintenance (in value terms) contracted on
      a competitive basis to domestic contractors.

1.3       Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

9.     The indicators relating to enabling the operation of ERA DMOs as profit centers
and increasing the share of domestic contractors in road maintenance were revised in
April 2010 at the time of the second additional financing. It was clear that since the scope
of APL2 did not include periodic and routine maintenance and ERA was already
reforming its approach to road maintenance these indicators could be dropped.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

10.     The main beneficiaries are not explicitly identified in the PAD for APL2. It may
however be inferred from the PDOs and key indicators that APL2 was expected to benefit
the general population and ERA. Successful implementation of APL2 would also benefit
local consultants and contractors who would be targeted for increased participation.

1.5       Original Components

11.   The original components as presented in the Project Appraisal Document for
APL2 are:

         Component 1 - The upgrading of Federal Trunk and Link Roads which consists
          of: (a) Assela-Dodola-Goba and Shashemene - Dodola section (316 km) of the
          Nazareth-Dodola/Shashemene-Goba federal trunk road; (b) GobGob-Weldiya
          section (194 km) of the Woreta-Weldiya federal link road; (c) Shire-Adwa-
          Adiabun section (83 km) of the Adigrat- Shire federal link road, and (d)
          consultancy services for construction supervision of the road works, and
          implementation of the associated environmental, safety, and resettlement plans
          and adverse social impact mitigation.

         Component 2 - Construction of Federal Link and Regional Rural Roads which
          consists of: (a) the construction of Magna-Mechara section (119 km) of the Dera-
          Mechara federal link road to a high standard gravel road; (b) The upgrading of
          existing and construction of new sections of the Assosa/Sherkole-Guba regional
          road to a gravel road surface standard (137 km); and (c) consultancy services for
          construction supervision of the road works, and implementation of the associated
          environmental, safety, and resettlement plans and adverse social impact
          mitigation.

         Component 3 - continued support to the Ethiopia Rural Travel and Transport
          Program (ERTTP) focused on preparation of additional Wereda studies and
          augmentation of existing TA support.




                                              3
            Component 4 - continued support to ERA (ERA) to enhance its capacity to plan
             road network maintenance and improvements; (a) by integrating Pavement
             Management System with Highway Development and Management Model 4
             (HDM4); (b) refining ERA’s financial management and management information
             (MIS) systems; and (c) technology transfer to and training of ERA staff in the
             relevant fields to further enhance ERA’s capacity.

            Component 5 - preparation of follow up operations in APL Stages 3 or 4,
             including feasibility of private sector participation in financing and
             implementation of road programs nationally as well as in Addis Ababa.

1.6          Revised Components

12.    The original components were not officially revised. However, the GoE took over
funding and delivery of the Shashemene-Dodola section which was constructed by
domestic contractors and supervised by domestic consultants. It was completed in 2009.

1.7          Other Significant Changes

13.     In September 2004 the Bank approved an IDA credit of US$160.9 million to
support the RSDP II. The IDA Board approved two packages of additional financing
during the life of APL2.

14.     The first additional financing was approved on June 22, 2006. Additional credit of
US$87.3 million was approved to address financing shortfalls between the estimates for
civil works at appraisal and contract bids 7.

15.    The second additional financing of US$100 million was approved on May 27,
2010. This additional financing was due to design changes and increases in quantities of
various works items 8 ; principally change of pavement designs for Assela-Goba and
Gobgob-Gheshena roads from Double Surface Treatment to Asphalt Concrete.

16.   The scope of APL2 was also changed when the GoE took over financing of the 70
km Shashemene-Dodola road. This was eventually completed by domestic contractors in
2009.

2.           Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

17.    APL2 contributed to enabling the RSDP to achieve its overall objectives. The
road projects constructed under APL2 are critical to the development priorities of the
GoE and the objectives of the RSDP. However, APL2 experienced significant cost
increases. The project had two separate cases of additional financings - US$87.3 million
in June 2006 and US$100 million in April 2010 respectively. The initial cost of APL2 at

                                                                 4
project appraisal was US$255.9 million. This increased to US$603.23 million at project
close in June 2012.

18.      In brief, the cost increases were largely associated with the engineering designs at
project preparation. In some instances the designs were incomplete, and in others the
initial designs did not fully take account of realities on ground. Consequently, changes
had to be made during implementation leading to cost increases. Subsequent paragraphs
highlight how these factors affected project implementation and outcomes. A discussion
of the reasons for the cost increases is given in Annex 2.

2.1       Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

19.     APL2 was responsive to the needs of the GoE to significantly increase investment
in road infrastructure as a means to create conditions conducive to economic growth. The
drive to improve road infrastructure was steered by the GoE and hinged on the RSDP. As
a result there was a strong commitment from the GoE from the start of APL2.

20.     The focus of RSDP was on improving the quality and extent of road infrastructure
in Ethiopia. Given the policy directions and the financing shortfalls needed to achieve
road network targets, APL2 was therefore well placed to support the GoE in its growth
aspirations.

21.     The final packaging of APL2 resulted from changes in World Bank support to
RSDP. Initially, World Bank support to RSDP was designed as a three stage Adaptable
Program Loan (APL). However, the funding ceiling for stage one (APL1) could not
accommodate the identified scope. As a result, stage one was divided into two phases - a
grant and loan portion respectively. This led to a four stage APL with APL2 covering the
five roads that could not be funded under APL1. The engineering design and feasibility
studies for the respective roads had been undertaken as part of APL1. Hence in
preparation for APL2, the projects prepared in June 2003 under APL1 were simply
carried forward to APL2 in August 2004.

22.     The cost increases in APL2 and the need for additional financing can be traced to
project preparation, quality of engineering design and construction risk management at
project preparation stage. Although a Quality at Entry review carried out in July 2003 9
(as part of APL1) rated the project’s technical soundness as Satisfactory, it became clear
during implementation that the project costs in APL2 could have been controlled if the
engineering designs had been advanced to a point where reliable cost estimates were
obtained.




9
 Projects in APL2 were originally designed as part of APL1. Due to funding constraints in APL1, some of the project roads were
eventually packaged as APL2 which was appraised soon after APL1 commenced. Hence a separate Quality at Entry review was
considered unnecessary.

                                                                5
2.2       Implementation

23.    The principal factors that affected implementation are related to impact of pre-
construction decisions, and project management and supervision of contracts.

Impact of Pre-construction Decisions

24.     The project got off to a challenging start with high bids relative to the Engineer’s
estimate 10 (with bids up to 200 percent higher than the Engineer’s cost estimate).
Moreover, four contracts received single bids at high prices – 150 percent more. These
bids were re-tendered but three of them were awarded to one contractor. To address the
shortfall resulting from the disparity between the engineer’s estimate and the bids,
additional financing of US$87.3 million was needed 11. It was asserted in the additional
financing project paper that the disparity between engineer’s estimate and the bids was
related to increased prices of fuel and bitumen between project conception and project
effectiveness 12. While this explanation may have some merit, the lack of realism of the
Engineer’s estimate cannot be explained simply by changes in commodity prices. Best
practice shows that realism of prices usually results from complete designs and accurate
information for developing cost estimates 13. Lack of realism in cost estimates can also
result from limited understanding of construction processes 14 . The differences in the
Engineer’s cost estimate and bids received from contractors may have been averted with
rigorous project risk management and value engineering to get a better understanding of
potential sources of cost increase and contingency requirements. Such a course of action
would have led to review and updating of the Client’s cost and budget estimates in line
with optimal engineering designs and prevailing market rates for key construction
materials.

Project Management and Supervision of Contracts

25.     By Mid Term Review in October 2007, most contracts were underway and the first
additional financing had covered the differences between the engineer’s estimate and the
bids received. The main emerging project challenge was that several of the contracts were
substantially delayed due to incomplete designs and bidding documents, and issues with
project supervision consultants 15. Annex 2 summarizes the specific issues with respective
projects and contains a detailed case study to elaborate on the highlighted issues.

26.    In April 2010, a request was made for a second additional financing of US$100
million to cater for design changes in road pavement from double bituminous surface
treatment (DBST) to Asphalt Concrete (AC). It was explained that the design changes
were necessary to take account of increased traffic; more than was anticipated during the

design stage of the Assela-Dodola-Goba and Gob Gob-Gashena road projects. In
addition, increased quantities of various work items (such as changes in urban and town
sections) were alleged to have contributed to the cost increases. The need for this second
additional financing could have been avoided with better project management.
Experience from several projects demonstrates the value of completing much of the
technical engineering design and agreeing on a project execution plan before
commitment to construction 16. Moreover, the details of traffic growth and its impact on
design of the project roads should have been taken into consideration and concluded
during project appraisal 17.

27.     In order to get to the root causes of the cost increases relative to project award, a
detailed analysis of all the projects was carried out during the ICR mission. The reasons
for cost increase in APL2 are summarized in Annex 2. In brief, the cost increases resulted
from variation orders and changes in design/correction of design errors and the associated
impact on price adjustments 18 . The variation orders resulting from design changes
amounted to US$87.78 million across the road projects and led to project delays of 2-3
years on several projects. Concomitant price adjustments and extension of time amounted
to US$168.5 million19. For example in the case of Shire-Adiabun which is detailed in
Annex 2, the contract award price of US$48.52 million increased to US$108.85 million.
This increase was principally due to changes in design of town sections and a by-pass
round the UNESCO world heritage site in Axum. The changes in design resulted in 682
days extension time and an associated price adjustment of US$36.4 million. In the case of
Dodola-Goba the contract price of US$33.28 million increased to US$116.82 million due
to a change from DBST to AC worth US$9.38 million and price adjustment of US$41.7
million (other design changes included widening in town sections, and new access
culverts). In both cases such design changes should have been taken care of as part of the
pre-construction engineering design and management. Similar observations can be made
for Megna-Mechara, Geshena-Woldiya and Assela-Dodola all of which were
characterized by significant cost overruns.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design

28.     The project indicators were agreed upon during project preparation. The
expectation was that ERA would provide a point of contact for monitoring the outcomes
and providing data for the World Bank team to monitor project progress. However two
fundamental aspects of the M&E design were not well articulated or missed altogether.
First, the design of the capacity building component could have been more thorough.

17

18
   Price adjustments are contractual provisions to respond to price volatility of construction materials and supplies such as asphalt, fuel,
cement and steel. In many cases, prospective bidders cannot obtain firm price quotes from material suppliers for the duration of the
project. This leads to price speculation and inflated bid prices to protect against possible price increases. Price adjustment allows the
contracting agency (the Client) to take on a portion of these risks and in return get lower bids.
19
   According to the price adjustment formula used for APL2 contracts, adjustments have to made for the cost of foreign labor,
equipment, fuel, bitumen and steel. The formula and indices were agreed at contract award. Any delays in project or client initiated
changes in scope would have the effect of increasing the value of price adjustment and hence cost of the project.

                                                                    7
Genuine capacity building is supposed to enable the institution to diagnose the shortfalls
in capacity and capability and to map-out a growth and maturity path. Second, the project
indicators should have been more specific, relevant and measurable. Due to the
weaknesses in M&E design, it is difficult to relate the key indicators to APL2. For
example, the first and second indicators focused on increasing road density and
percentage of roads in good condition across the entire 54,000 km of classified road
network under ERA. This indicator is useful for measuring the progress of the entire
RSDP. However, it is difficult to attribute improvements in such indicators to APL2
which is less than one percent of Ethiopia’s classified road network. ERA has an annual
road budget of US$1.5 billion whereas the average annual disbursement for APL2 was
US$50-70 million. Consequently, while it is possible to argue that APL2 contributed
towards improvement in overall road density and condition of ERA’s classified network,
it is not realistic to attribute such improvements to APL2. The same can be said of the
indicators related to participation of domestic contractors in routine and periodic
maintenance as APL2 never had any maintenance or indeed participation of domestic
contractors.

29.     In summary, it is obvious that the indicators chosen for M&E in APL2 would not
be used for similar projects today. With the benefit of hindsight and improvements in
Bank wide design of results indicators, it now seems that more pragmatic measures of
impact such as reduction in travel time, improvement in riding quality of project roads
and savings in vehicle operating costs could have been used at the program level, while
measuring the delivery of physical infrastructure i.e. kilometers constructed at the project
level. These would have provided measurable indicators that could be directly attributed
to the investments in APL2.

M&E Implementation

30.    For the chosen indicators, a baseline was established for APL2 based on the
RSDP. ERA supplied the relevant data and Bank followed through on the progress
through regular supervision missions.

M&E Utilization

31.     The data required to produce the indicators was readily available. At the start of
the project, the baseline for chosen indicators was established and the indicators were
tracked throughout the project. Of course as noted above, the M&E could have been
better designed.

2.4    Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

32.     At appraisal, the project triggered a category A rating as safeguards were
identified in two areas: Environmental and Involuntary Resettlement.

33.     Environment and Social safeguards compliance - For the most part, overall
safeguards compliance and compliance with environmental safeguards was rated
Satisfactory. However in June 2008, a number of issues relating to workers health and

                                             8
safety, and environmental protection begun to be highlighted in the implementation status
and results report 20 . It was only in October 2009 21 that safeguards compliance issues
were reflected in the respective ISR ratings. The environment compliance was
downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. The same rating was maintained till the end of
the project. Several environmental and social safeguards issues persisted till the end of
APL2 22 . Nonetheless, it was evident during the ICR mission that the implementing
agency had started taking steps to address these issues. These included reinforcing of the
Environment Monitoring Unit and more recently an industry wide training on
environmental and social issues. These efforts are commendable and need to be
supported.

34.     Procurement and Financial Management – In April 2004, the World Bank carried
out a procurement assessment of the capacity of the implementing agency to carryout
procurement actions in compliance with World Bank requirements. As a result of this
assessment, additional staff was recruited to support the procurement function and several
training sessions were held to address the shortfalls. However as noted earlier in section
2.2, the quality of the client’s engineering designs affected the cost estimates and
procurement of the projects. Moreover, the bid evaluation and contracts award stage were
faced with challenges of limited competition. The lowest evaluated bids were much
higher than the engineer’s cost estimates and the client eventually rejected four of the
bids and chose to retender the contracts as the received bids were much higher than both
the budget and the Engineer’s cost estimates. As highlighted earlier these procurement
challenges relate to project preparation decisions and the fact that the client’s cost
estimates had not been updated to reflect realistic market prices.

35.    During project implementation, one of the contractors, as well as a shareholder of
a second contractor were debarred. These decisions did not influence the completion of
the works. However, the final variation orders for both contracts were not cleared for
Bank-financing. At the time some funds associated with these variation orders were
already disbursed. Government of Ethiopia will be required to refund the ineligible payments
associated with contract amendments that were not approved by the Bank.

36.     ERA received support from several donor organizations to implement financial
management improvement in various areas such as internal controls, auditing,
accounting, flow of funds, reporting and monitoring. The project seems to have
benefitted from these efforts in addition to the country’s discipline in executing budget
and compliance with the government’s regulations for projects. To a large extent, ERA
has complied with the financial management covenants with the exception of the delays
in submission of the entity audit reports.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

37.     APL2 was part of a four stage program with specific triggers. As a result APL3
was triggered after overall average disbursement of 30 percent of on-going civil works in
APL2. As the APL program comes to an end, the post completion phase needs to refocus
on areas which have exposed weaknesses in APL1 and APL2. Any future engagement of
the World Bank to support the sustainability of the APLs and the RSDP needs to focus
on:

a) Strengthening the focus on technical engineering design in the early stages of each
   new project and contract management during implementation - most of the cost
   increases across APL2 can be traced to inadequate or flawed engineering designs. It
   was evident from the Implementation Completion Results (ICR) mission that ERA
   has several competent and dedicated technical staff. The experience of APL2 should
   therefore trigger a mechanism for consolidating various competencies to scrutinize
   individual projects and identify/mitigate risks resulting from inadequacies in
   engineering designs. In addition, emphasis needs to be placed on contract
   administration and engineering project management during implementation. Both are
   operational responsibilities that focus on achieving time, cost and quality objectives
   of selected projects. A central part of the client capacity and capability building has
   got to tackle the weaknesses exposed in delivery of APL2. Such efforts should
   necessarily seek to introduce best practice in risk management, design management,
   value analysis and engineering, cost control and contract management. It may even be
   possible to develop a specific engineering project management framework such as is
   common in many international public sector client organizations.

b) Road asset management- In order to support the sustainability of the investments
   made through the APL (and more broadly the RSDP), the pavement management and
   asset decision support systems need to be exploited more fully. This means that use of
   software (such as HDM4) should be part of a broader context addressing processes,
   procedures, culture, values and technological enablers. All other aspects of improving
   overall road asset management should receive equal focus so that the system may be
   used for making decisions about prioritizing new road construction or rehabilitation
   efforts. Such an approach would influence policy decisions about contract strategy
   and asset management such Design & Build contracting or performance based
   maintenance contracts which have been piloted as part of APL3. ERA has recently
   introduced the new directorate of asset management which has the mandate of
   looking after the road assets. For the long term sustainability of RSDP, this new
   directorate needs to be supported and strengthened by adopting best practice from
   other countries that have been successful in asset management. Moreover, the three
   directorates (planning, operations and asset management) need to have a mechanism
   for integrating activities and focusing on the whole life cycle of individual projects.

38.     A road map articulating how the above areas will be addressed would go a long
way in supporting the next phase of World Bank engagement and the future of the RSDP
after 2015.

                                           10
3.        Assessment of Outcomes

3.1       Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

39.     APL2 contributed to enabling the RSDP to achieve its overall objectives. The
road projects constructed under APL2 are critical to the development priorities of the
GoE and the objectives of the RSDP. Support to the RSDP continues to remain a priority
for the partnership between the World Bank and the GoE 23.

3.2       Achievement of Project Development Objectives

40.  The objectives of APL2 24 (the project) were identified in the Project Appraisal
Documents. The following paragraphs assess achievement of these objectives.

     Achievement of objective 1 - increase the road transport infrastructure and improve
      its reliability. The investment in physical infrastructure under APL2 contributed to
      increasing the road density and condition of good roads under ERA. By the end of
      APL2 the eight critical road construction projects were completed; adding 790 km of
      upgraded roads to the classified road network. However, as discussed in section 2.3, it
      is difficult to attribute achievements in road density and condition across the entire
      classified road network under ERA to APL2.

     Achievement of objective 2 - create conditions conducive to private sector
      participation in the road transport sector. Similar to several of the road projects
      under ERA, domestic consultants participated in joint venture partnerships with
      international consultants in APL2. However, achievement of this objective cannot be
      attributed to APL2. There was no participation of local contractors on any of the road
      projects financed under APL2 (except the 70 km Shashemene-Dodola road section
      which was eventually financed by the GoE). Furthermore, the project indicators for
      percentage of domestic contractor participation were dropped at the time of second
      additional financing as there was no road maintenance in APL2.

     Achievement of objective 3 - strengthen the capacity for road construction,
      management and maintenance. This objective was partially achieved. The
      investments in pavement management systems, financial management systems and
      management information systems have provided needed support towards efforts to
      reform ERA. Interviewees in the ICR mission also observed that Bank processes and
      the experience of APL2 contributed towards the current program by ERA to improve
      awareness of environmental and social safeguards among ERA staff and in the wider
      industry. However, the time delays and project cost overruns under APL2 indicate
      that there is still some way to go in fully achieving this objective. Specific

      strengthening is needed in areas such as engineering design, value engineering, risk
      management and contract administration. This will become especially critical if ERA
      moves towards performance based contracts and design & build type procurement
      strategies which require adequate knowledge of assets and more sophisticated client
      skills to productively engage with the private sector and to obtain value for money.

3.3        Efficiency

Efficiency measured from Outcomes

41.     At project appraisal, an economic analysis was conducted for the civil works
components of the project which constitute 90 percent of the total project financing.
HDM3 analysis was carried out against a ‘do minimum’ case and +/- 20 percent
sensitivity to cost increases. All project roads were reported in the PAD to have positive
Net Present Values (NPV) and Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR) of more than
10.23 percent 25. Table 1 below shows the appraisal costs and Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) for the roads for which an ex-post economic evaluation was done 26.

42.     For comparison purposes, the original project roads evaluated at appraisal and
associated assumptions have been applied to project close. The ex-post economic
evaluation was done for rehabilitation and upgrading of three feeder roads for which
actual traffic data was available at appraisal and end of project. Of course, as earlier
indicated the final project construction packages differed from the appraisal packages.
Shashemene-Dodola was funded and delivered by the GoE, Gobgob-Weldiya was
delivered as two projects, Assela-Dodola and Dodola-Goba were also packaged as
separate projects. Nevertheless, in order to make comparison possible, the original
appraisal packaging has been maintained. The costs are given in ETB 2004 prices.
Annex 3 provides details of the economic and financial analysis.

43.     To compare the appraisal and final actual costs, 2011 prices were discounted
using the Ethiopian price index. The ex-post evaluation was done by first replicating the

appraisal economic evaluation results and then updating the project costs with the actual
upgrading costs. The ex-post ERR for the first two roads declined relative to appraisal
ERR, but are still above the threshold of 10.23 percent. The decline may be attributed to
the cost increases and delays in completion. The ex-post ERR of the third road (Shire-
Adiabun) decreased to 24.3 percent from the 30.2 percent estimated at appraisal, due to
the higher upgrading costs. In sum, it is evident that while the project experienced
significant cost increases, the economic indicators seem to show that the benefits are
greater than the final costs. Most of the benefits relate to savings in travel time and
vehicle operating costs.

Efficiency measured at Performance

44.    The performance of APL2 was affected by pre-construction decisions related to
engineering design of the project roads. The initial bids were much higher than the
estimates on which project appraisal was based. As a result the project required additional
financing. During implementation, the cost of civil works increased considerably due to
changes in design and /or incomplete designs.

3.4       Justification of Overall Outcome. Rating – Moderately Satisfactory

45.     APL2 contributed to increasing the essential road transport infrastructure in
Ethiopia. During the project life of APL2 the road density increased from 30.8 km/1000
sq. km in 2003 to 48.10 km/1000 sq km in 2012. APL2 also contributed to the increase in
proportion of roads in good condition from 32 percent in 2003 to 88 percent in 2012.
However, as earlier discussed GoE has been investing approximately US$1.5 billion per
year in upgrading the road infrastructure. While the improvements in road density and
condition cannot be attributed to APL2, the investment certainly contributed to the
achievements of the RSDP. APL2 could have made a more significant impact on RSDP
and the development objectives of Ethiopia if the project costs were better managed at
project preparation.

3.5       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

46.     Gender aspects and social development – APL2 and the associated investments
in road infrastructure will have a significant impact on the affected populations. The
project roads will contribute to opening up potential opportunities for the local population
to access the main urban centers as RSDP reaches the goal of connecting every citizen
within 2 km of an all-weather road by 2015. This may have both economic and social
benefits as improvement in transport will enable youth and women to have better access
to social services such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, as the GoE prioritizes
modernization of agriculture, good roads will be the back bone. The Transport and
Poverty Observatory Studies 27 show that access to roads directly affects the activities of



27
   Commissioned by the GoE to monitor poverty impacts of road project investment at local community and at household level and to
assess the development impact of road infrastructure and transport operations in terms of accessibility, mobility and income

                                                               13
women - for example, by easing access to healthcare and business opportunities. The new
roads were also observed to encourage production and use of intermediate modes of
transport for rural to urban travel. Implementation of the Wereda Integrated Development
plans will benefit from investment in roads by enabling easier access to services for
women (water, grinding mills, schools, health care facilities etc.).

47.     Institutional change - The overall responsibility for RSDP lies with ERA which
is the implementing agency. ERA also manages and administers the Trunk and Major
Link Roads Program. ERA was initially organized into three departments – Regulatory
and Engineering Services, Planning & Operations and Human Resources & Financial
Management. During the life of APL2, a new Asset Management directorate was created
as part of the ERA modernization agenda. As a result of the various efforts under the
RSDP and support from donors, ERA has evolved and attracted relatively competent
staff. However, the remuneration of the staff has not kept pace with investments in
physical infrastructure and growth in the economy and the domestic construction sector.
The organization has therefore experienced high staff turn-over; especially at mid-level
and among technical staff. Several of these individuals have been attracted to the private
sector which has more competitive wages. This is an issue which will have to be
addressed as the long term sustainability of investments in the road infrastructure hinge
on the availability and continuity of competent staff in ERA and other public agencies.

48.     Given that ERA and the Road Fund are fully operational and have registered
improvements in project delivery, the risks to development outcome is considered
moderate. The GoE and associated development partners are committed to the growth of
the road sector. APL2 has provided much needed funding for improving the road
infrastructure. The main challenge in the future will be provision of funding to maintain
the condition of the infrastructure and the management ability of ERA in Road Asset
Management, Engineering Project Management and extracting value for money from
engagements with the private sector. Addressing the future challenges hinges on ERA
being able to attract, train and retain high quality staff with the relevant informed client
competencies.

49.    Overall at the time of ICR review, it is considered unlikely that the roads
constructed under APL2 will receive less attention from the Borrower and implementing
agency. The main risk to sustainability of the outcomes relates to the institutional issues.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

a) Ensuring Quality at Entry. Rating – Moderately Unsatisfactory
50.     The rating at entry is based on the fact that APL2 as a source of funding for the
road infrastructure was responsive to the needs of the GoE to improve the extent and
quality of the road network. In this sense the project was therefore timely and relevant.
However, as noted earlier, most of the cost overruns can be traced to project preparation.
Insufficient engineering design led to costly changes and modifications during
construction. Several of the interviews during the ICR mission observed that while the
Bank provided ample advice on addressing environmental, social, procurement and
financial management safeguards, there was limited engineering advice during project
preparation. Part of the value-added by the World Bank should have been the potential to
draw on global experience in best practice of engineering design and project
management. This would have led to more robust engineering designs and hence avoided
the cost overruns.

51.    Moreover, there was sufficient experience from the region to design the capacity
building and technical support components to enable institutional growth while filling the
competency gaps that led to cost overruns.

b) Quality of Supervision. Rating – Moderately Satisfactory

52.     The rating is given because the Bank supervision was regular. The interviews
during the ICR mission also confirmed that towards the latter part of the project, the Bank
provided support in procurement and technical engineering aspects of the project due to
new recruitment of appropriate Bank staff. This also led to improved response times for
issues relating to the second additional financing and requirements for ‘no objection’.

c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance. Rating - Moderately
      Satisfactory
53.     The Bank team exercised good judgment in capturing the needs and potential
impact of APL2 on development agenda of Ethiopia. However, project development
objectives were not properly designed, hence complicating M&E of the project. Also
many of the critical problems experienced during implementation have their origin in pre-
construction decisions over which the Bank had much influence.

5.2     Borrower Performance. Rating - Moderately Satisfactory

a)      Government Performance. Rating – Moderately Satisfactory

54.    The provision of adequate road infrastructure is seen as central to the
development ambitions of Ethiopia and as such the various phases of the RSDP have
continued to receive increasing support from the GoE. This commitment has given the

                                            15
development partners an anchor to provide support when needed. However, the GoE
remains the greatest contributor to the road infrastructure development program (70
percent of the road budget was funded by the GoE between 1997 and 2011). The
Government was responsive to project needs and fulfilled their obligations relating to
covenants and agreements. This included provision of extra funding to cover the cost
overruns (150 percent more than was anticipated at appraisal). The GoE also ended up
funding the 70 km Shashemene-Dodola road. It is therefore evident that the GoE
supported the project. To derive the maximum benefits from the investment in the sector,
the Government needs to continue the same commitment towards maintenance of the
road assets and strengthening ERA and providing competitive remuneration to attract and
retain high caliber staff.

b) Implementing Agency performance. Rating – Moderately Unsatisfactory

55.      ERA was the executing agency for APL2. The institution has developed
considerably since the formulation of the RSDP. However, the experience in both APL1
and APL2 demonstrate the need to strengthen technical and managerial capability of
ERA (see section 2). Of course, building capacity must be seen in a wider context of the
original base and it must be acknowledged that improving the capacity of public
institutions is a long term undertaking which could not be addressed within the limited
scope and timeframe of APL2. The relative improvements must be noted.

56.      At an operational level, ERA was ultimately responsible for supervision of the
road projects. In general, all projects in APL2 were characterized by cost overruns, costly
design changes, delays in schedule, issues with quality of work and engagement with
consultants and contractors. The experience demonstrates that there is still scope for ERA
to improve in areas of project and design management, construction risk management,
value engineering and asset management. While addressing the challenges of high staff
turn-over, a more holistic approach to institutional maturity has to be developed; perhaps
initially alongside Technical Assistance in specific areas.

c)   Justification of Rating of overall Borrower Performance Rating – Moderately
     Satisfactory

57.    The overall performance of the Borrower is rated Moderately Satisfactory
principally because the targeted roads are essential to the development of Ethiopia. All
the roads in APL2 were eventually built. However this was achieved at considerably
higher cost than anticipated, with major issues of quality and long after the anticipated
time schedule. It may be argued that some of the factors that contributed to these
challenges were beyond the scope of ERA (such as the volatile cost of materials).
Nonetheless, the most significant factors were within the control of ERA as a client. One
of the main reasons for the incomplete designs seems to have been the pressure from the
Government to speed up preparation of projects. This may have affected the quality of
designs which would have benefitted from more time for preparation.




                                            16
6.     Lessons Learned

58.    Through the experience of APL2 several project-specific and more general
lessons for similar undertakings may be learned:

59.     Technical engineering input during project preparation – the main factors
affecting implementation and outcomes in APL2 are rooted in the early project stages.
Ultimately, the responsibility for this stage rests with the implementing agency. ERA has
many competent staff and the reform program has adapted to the increased budget
received by the road sector. Nevertheless, the experience of APL2 shows that it may be
helpful to create a client hub made up of individuals from ERA (or bought in as required
from external sources) to support project preparation. The ICR therefore proposes that
ERA set-up a Technical Panel to focus on risk management and value engineering of
projects during preparation. This panel would carry out detailed review of engineering
designs for new projects and cost estimates. This would also provide an anchor for skills
in areas such as: contract management, contract negotiations, risk management, value
engineering and design management. Recent Bank funded projects in Ethiopia have
started to support ERA in shifting their focus on technical input in the project preparation
process by allocating more resources for technical design review.

60.     Strategically driven and holistic capacity building, and competitive
remuneration to attract and retain the best staff in ERA - It is widely accepted that an
organization’s performance is closely linked to the people working within it. Hence the
success or otherwise of the public sector client in delivering infrastructure necessary for
supporting economic growth is closely linked to identifying, attracting, training and
retaining the right individuals. Unfortunately in the case of ERA the growth in the
economy has contributed to a high staff turn-over as many are attracted to better
remunerated opportunities in the private sector. Organizational reforms that reflect the
roles of key staff alongside market competitive salaries are needed. Perhaps even more
important is the need to align the needed skills sets to the evolving role of ERA through a
top-down and holistic approach to capacity building rather through ad hoc training.
Ideally, an institutional maturity approach which allows the organization to diagnose
competency needs alongside enablers such as processes, systems, procedures and goals
would be a better approach. It would then be possible for the organization to map-out a
maturity strategy aligned with current and future needs.

61.     Project management and thorough investigation of the reasons for cost
increase across the entire ERA portfolio of projects – at the operational level, the
project management skills needed to control time, cost and quality need to be addressed.
The cost overruns in APL2 and issues with delays and quality could have been alleviated.
For the future, ERA needs to focus on improving cost effectiveness by better analysis of
the reasons for high costs, understanding the reasons for cost variations and working
collaboratively with contractors to reduce costs across the entire project portfolio. The
need for this kind of approach should have been highlighted in earlier projects and
included in the design of APL2.


                                            17
62.     Results chain and design of measurable M&E framework – APL2 delivered
on the main project components; albeit at a higher cost. The challenge during the ICR
review was attributing achievements in the results indicators to the project. In the future
design of similar projects should enable the design of indicators for which direct
attribution is possible. Following the results chain, indicators for the project should have
included such attributes such as rate of delivery of physical infrastructure for the outputs
and intermediate indicators of progress in key activities. The outcome indicators could
have been factors such as the riding quality of the constructed roads, savings in travel
time and reduction in vehicle operating costs. These are results oriented indicators which
are specific, measurable and perhaps more importantly can be attributed to the project.

63.     Need for strategic focus on infrastructure asset management – the new asset
management directorate needs to work closely with the planning directorate. In order to
support the sustainability of the investments made through the APL (and more broadly
the RSDP), the pavement management and asset decision support systems need to be
exploited more fully to support maintenance management of the entire road network.
This means that use of software (such as HDM4) should be part of a broader context
addressing processes, procedures, culture, values and technological enablers. Such an
approach would influence policy decisions about contract strategy and asset management
through performance based contracts which have been piloted as part of APL3. ERA
needs to reconcile short-term priorities focused on upgrading roads and the long-term
plans for whole life asset management. For this to be possible ERA needs clear focused
asset management plans and better inventory of road assets. Also as part of the strategy
for better asset management, the pilot projects utilizing the performance based approach
to contracting and design & build contract strategies need to be expanded while taking
into account the skills sets needed to make them successful.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

a)     Borrower/Implementing Agency

64.    The official comments of the Government are in Annex 5. Most of the
observations and analysis in the ICR was discussed with the implementing agency during
the ICR mission. In the comments received, the implementing agency raised two issues:

 (i)   Reasons for the cost increase – ERA observes that in addition to design changes
       the high cost of projects could be attributed to turbulence in commodity prices,
       the global recession, high inflation and shortage of construction materials. As part
       of the ICR mission, each project was analyzed in detail. Annex 2 of the ICR
       summarizes the sources of cost increase. It is obvious from figures 2.1 and 2.2
       and table 2.1 that price adjustment which made the greatest contribution to cost
       increases is affected by the issues highlighted by ERA. However, the need for
       price adjustment which contributed to the cost increase is rooted in design
       changes and associated delays. These issues are discussed in section 2 of the main
       report.



                                            18
(ii)    Reasons for ERR of project roads – ERA notes that decrease in ERR for Assela-
        Goba/Shashemene-Dodola and Gobgob-Weldiya is not due to low traffic but
        rather cost increases. As shown in Annex 3, the traffic on the two roads actually
        declined relative to appraisal. Nonetheless, the discussion of table 1 acknowledges
        the dual impact of traffic and cost of construction.

b)      Cofinanciers

65.     Comments were received from the European Union (EU) and Department for
international Development, UK (DfID). Both organizations contributed to the Ethiopia
Rural Travel and Transport Programme (ERTTP) and the Wereda studies. The studies
were successfully implemented and pilot implementation is complete. The following
observations were made about points raised in the report.

 (i)    Cost overruns – It was noted that the report highlighted a long standing shortfall
        of ERA. The cost overruns and delays in project schedule are wider issues. The
        performance appraisal mechanism of contractors and consultants and its
        effectiveness to date should offer great insight into the problems of cost overruns.
        While the impact and role of contractors and consultants cannot be
        underestimated, in the specific experience on APL2, the cost increases relate to
        preconstruction inadequacies and incomplete engineering designs. The reasons for
        this conclusion are discussed in section 2 and annex 2.

(ii)    Competition in the Sector – It was observed that market is dominated by a limited
        number of contractors potentially resulting in collusion. As noted in section 2.2
        APL2 had limited number of contractors. This can reasonably be expected to
        affect competition. However, the ICR preparation did not find evidence of
        collusion.

(iii)   Capacity of ERA and high Staff turn-over - it was noted that ERA has limited
        capacity to supervise technical designs and that the issue of high staff turn-over
        due to disparities in remuneration relative to the private sector has been
        highlighted on several occasions. The ICR fully concurs with the observation. The
        evidence from this ICR should add to the calls for the Government of Ethiopia to
        revisit this issue which is central to obtaining value for money and the long term
        sustainability of significant investments being made by development partners and
        the GoE.

                                        Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The objectives of the APL2 (the Project) were to increase the road transport
infrastructure and improve its reliability, strengthen the capacity for road construction,
management and maintenance, and create conditions conducive to private sector
participation in the road transport sector. These objectives were to be achieved through:
(a) construction, rehabilitation, upgrading and preserving the priority federal and regional
road network; (b) strengthened ERA reform program; (c) developing the capacity in
program implementation; and (d) improving rural travel and transport services. The
project had five components.

Component 1 - Upgrading of Federal Trunk and Link Roads 28

2.      The roads under this component of APL2 were originally earmarked for
rehabilitation and/or upgrading under APL1 (IDA Grant H049-ET). Hence, the feasibility
studies, environmental impact assessments, and engineering designs for all road projects
were carried out as part of preparation of seven road projects financed under APL1.
Component 1 originally involved upgrading of 593 km of Federal trunk and link roads
from gravel to bituminous paved road surface standard.

•    Upgrading of the Assela-Dodola & Shashemene-Goba road (246 km). The
     project road lies entirely in Oromiya Region in the South Eastern part of Ethiopia and
     begins at Assela town, which is situated about 170 km away from Addis Ababa. The
     original scope consisted of the upgrading of the Assela-Dodola & Shashemene-Goba
     section of the Nazareth-Dodola/Shashemene-Goba gravel road to a double
     bituminous surface treated standard. At appraisal, the overall road condition was
     classified as poor. The road is classified as a trunk road and was targeted for upgrade
     from gravel to double bituminous surface treated road with a 7.0 m width carriageway
     and 1.5 m wide shoulders. At appraisal, this project was anticipated to cost US$79.48
     million.
•    Upgrading of Shashemene-Dodola Junction (70 km). This road is classified as a
     trunk road and was to be upgraded from gravel to double surface dressing with a 7.0
     m carriageway and 1.5 m wide shoulders. The works were expected to be packaged as
     5 lots and contracted to enable increased domestic contractor participation. This
     project was anticipated to cost US$17.44 million. Actual achieved at completion – 70
     km at a cost of US$47 million, financed by GoE.

•     Upgrading of the Gob Gob-Gashena -Woldiya road (194 km). Involves
     upgrading of (i) the Gob Gob-Gashena (86 km) section of the Woreta-Weldiya road
     from gravel to a double bituminous surface treated road, and (ii) the Gashena–
     Woldiya (108 km) section of the Woreta-Weldiya road from gravel to an asphalt
     concrete surface with carriageway width of 7.0 m and 1.5 m wide shoulders. The


28
  Figure 2.1 shows the cost profile of the individual roads under component 1 and component 2 at contract award and completion. It is
evident that most projects were characterized by significant cost increases. Figure 2.2 and Table 2.1 outline the reasons for cost
increases. The reasons for changes in cost profile for each road are subsequently discussed.

                                                                21
    Woreta-Weldiya road covering a total length of about 293 km lies entirely in the
    Amhara Region. It is of high socio-economic importance and serves as a major traffic
    collector, traversing mostly difficult terrain to connect the Wollo and Gondar sub-
    regions. At appraisal, the road was reported to be fully engineered with a gravel-
    surfaced road first constructed between the 1977 and 1983. As a result of a major
    maintenance program, re-gravelling of this road was done under ERRP. The
    mountainous nature of the area traversed by the road had become a cause for erosion
    and surface wear; hence, its recommendation for upgrading. This project was
    anticipated to cost US$45.02 million.

•   Upgrading of the Adwa-Shire road (83 km). The road is part of the Adigrat-
    Axum-Shire road that provides an important east-west link between the two primary
    North-South trunk roads in the northern region of Tigray. The mountainous terrain,
    which the road traverses, makes transportation difficult during the wet season. The
    existing road at project appraisal was a fully engineered gravel surface road with
    carriageway width of 7.0 m covering an underlying Telford base. The Telford base
    was exposed over some sections of the road in spite of being re-graveled under the
    ERRP. This road classified as a major link road and the upgrading was expected to
    improve it to an asphalt concrete surface. This project was anticipated to cost
    US$25.46 million. Actual achieved at completion – 83 km at a cost of US$79.18
    million. Upgraded to an asphalt concrete surface.

Component 2- Construction of Federal/Link and Regional Rural Roads

3.      The priority under the RSDP I was focused on the rehabilitation and strengthening
of the highest priority trunk roads that were found in a dilapidated condition. The RSDP
II focused on improving road density by opening up new potential development areas and
increasing connectivity, along with completion of the rehabilitation and upgrading
requirements of the road network. As a result, IDA’s support to the RSDPII also involved
the construction of Federal/Link and Rural Roads namely the Magna-Mechara (119 km),
and the Assosa/Sherkole-Guba (137 km) roads, respectively,

•   The construction of the Magna-Mechara road (119 km). This road section is part
    of the Dera-Mechara road (239.10 km) project, which is located in the central part of
    Ethiopia in the Oromiya region. The road starts at Magna and connects to the Dera-
    Mechara (119 km) section financed as part of APL1. Project works on the proposed
    federal road link were foreseen to be constructed to a 6.0 m wide carriageway with
    1.5 m shoulders and a gravel surface pavement. The Dera-Mechara road branches off
    at Dera town from the Nazareth-Assela trunk road 24 km from Addis Ababa, and runs
    in a northeasterly direction towards Mechara from where it connects to the Addis
    Ababa – Dire/Dawa trunk road. The population and economy of the area traversed by
    the road is almost totally dependent upon agriculture and livestock. The sector
    employs more than 90 percent of the economically active population in the project
    area. The construction of the road was expected to make a significant contribution to
    improving some of the constraints on agricultural and livestock development in the
    project area. This project was anticipated to cost US$29.16 million.

                                           22
•   The construction of the Assossa/Sherkole-Guba road (137 km) to gravel
    standard. The road is located in the western part of Ethiopia and the Benishangul
    Gumuz Region, interconnecting two of the most isolated zones of the Benishangul-
    Gumuz Region. Improving the road would provide a north-south transport backbone
    that is crucial for effective integration of the region. The proposed direct route was
    expected to reduce travel time and generate significant economic interaction between
    the regions. At the time of appraisal the section from Sherkole to the Abay River was
    impassable for motor vehicles and other sections of the road were routinely closed in
    the wet season. This project was anticipated to cost US$17.87 million.


•   Construction Supervision. - This involved the provision of consultancy services for
    the supervision of civil works and the implementation of associated environmental,
    safety, and resettlement plans and adverse social impact mitigation. The cost of
    supervision of the road projects in component 1 and 2 was estimated at US$13.79
    million. Eight supervision contracts were signed for the above civil works. Actual
    cost at completion – US$16.5 million

Component 3 - Support to the Rural Travel and Transport Program (US$2.05
million)

4.      This component was expected to support the implementation of the ERTTP by
financing (i) the preparation of 60 Wereda development plans for future implementation
under APL3, other IDA programs and or other source of funding; and (ii) institutional
strengthening of ERA in its role as the lead agency for the implementation of the ERTTP
and Secretariat of the Central Program Coordinating Board.

•   Preparation of 40 Wereda Integrated Development Plans – WIDP. This sub-
    component was to assist with the preparation of the Wereda Integrated Development
    plans as part of the planned expansion of the pilot implementation of the ERTTP
    concept and approaches in eight Weredas under joint funding with Ireland Aid and
    Department for International Development, UK during APL1. The plans were to be
    prepared using the methodologies and frameworks contained in the 'Guidelines for
    Preparing Wereda Plans’. The WIDPs were expected to contain interventions for (a)
    improvement of community/wereda road networks including mechanisms for their
    sustainable maintenance; (b) promotion of the use of IMTs; (c) provision of small
    scale infrastructure facilities (e.g., water wells, health clinics, etc.) which contribute
    to reducing the travel and time burdens of the community; and (d) improving the
    institutional and financing frameworks for sustainable service delivery.

•   Support to establishment of ERTTP institutional. The ERTTP embodies many
    ideas and concepts, the successful implementation of which required ERA to be able
    to discharge its mandate as the lead agency for the implementation of the ERTTP and

                                             23
   Secretariat of the Central Program Coordinating Board. This sub-component was
   expected to assist in financing expansion of the ERTTP Unit within ERA so that it
   would eventually be able to provide technical guidance to implementers, undertake
   studies into specific issues arising during ERTTP implementation and the distillation
   of the lessons and experience emerging.

Component 4 - Institutional Strengthening of ERA (US$1.60 million)

5.       The focus of this component was on supporting (i) updating the Pavement
Management System and calibrating it with HDM4 for Ethiopia to enable more effective
network planning and management, (ii) refining ERA’s financial management system
and interface with Management Information System (MIS) at head office to effectively
support, administer and manage the process of commercialization of some functions of
ERA’s DMOs and head office; and (iii) organizing technology transfer and training
activities with regard to the effective implementation of the above two updated systems.

Component 5 - Support to Accomplishment of Program Objectives

6.      The purpose of this component was to provide consultancy services to carry out
feasibility studies, and ESIA studies, as well as, design and design review for road
projects to be included under follow-on operations. The possible projects were those that
were planned to be executed under the APL3, 4 and thereafter. This component was
anticipated to cost US$0.8 million.

Reasons for Cost Increase on Project Roads
7.      Overall, the changes in design associated with widening town sections and the
change in pavement structure from double surface treatment to asphalt concrete had a
significant impact on the cost of the roads under APL2. Moreover these changes also
affected the progress of site activities with associated impact on price adjustment for the
main imported materials (fuel, bitumen and steel) and cost of construction equipment.
Other modifications in the original design also led to increases in quantities of materials.
For example on the Assosa-Sherkole (Blue Nile) the original cost of the contract went
from US$22.62 to US$36.30. A total of US$16 million was the result of increased
quantities beyond the original estimates.

8.      FIDIC conditions of contract in keeping with most other conditions of contract
allow for price adjustment at the time of tender. Price volatility of construction materials
and supplies such as asphalt, fuel, cement and steel can often result in significant
problems for contractors in preparing realistic bids. Prospective bidders may find it
difficult to obtain firm price quotes from material suppliers for the duration of projects
which are typically two to three years long. To hedge these risks prospective bidders may
be forced into price speculation and inflated bid prices to protect against possible price
increases. Price adjustment provisions allow clients to take on some of these risks
associated with price volatility of major materials often resulting in lower bids.

9.      In the case of APL2 most projects experienced major changes in design and
delays of up to three years. Hence the impact of price adjustment was significant and
greatly contributed to the cost increases. A total of US$168 million of the final cost of
APL2 (57 percent of the original contract price) was the result of price adjustments on the
various contracts. These are legitimate payments to contractors which are included in
contract documentation. The only way to alleviate the impact of price adjustment is to
control the number of client initiated changes to the original scope of the project and
control the schedule parameters to ensure project delays are not significant.
Uncharacteristically, the claims associated with extension of time as a result of the design
changes were not significant (less than 2 percent).

10.     A detailed case study of the Shire-Adiabun road which was visited during the ICR
mission provides further details to elaborate on the reasons for the cost increases on a
specific project to illustrate the issues highlighted above.

                        Detailed Case Study - Shire-Adiabun Project

Summary Project Description

11.     The Shire – Adiabun road is located in the northwestern part of Ethiopia and is
one of the oldest trunk roads in the Country. It is part of the Adigrat – Adwa – Shire road
that connects the regional states of Amharic and Tigray. It also provides access to
Ethiopia’s neighbors. The mountainous terrain, which the road traverses, makes
transportation difficult during the wet season. The project objective was to upgrade the
existing gravel road to an asphalt concrete surface.

12.     At project appraisal the road consisted of gravel base 5.0 - 7.0 m wide and
approximately 150 mm thick, with 0.5 m to 1.0 m earthen shoulder. The project road was
designed as an upgraded 7.0 m carriage way asphalt concrete (AC) surface with 1.5 m
gravel shoulder in plain and 0.5 m to 1.0 m shoulder in hilly terrain. The project
preparation was based on an old design which was reviewed by another design consultant
in January 1998 as part of APL1. The project package was eventually funded under
APL2. As shown in Table 2.3 below, the project experienced cost overruns and
variations. The cost at appraisal was 91 percent lower than the final contract award price
and final project cost as at June 30, 2012 was 124 percent more than the contract price.
Moreover the project was delivered 2 years later than anticipated. The aim of this case
study is to provide in-depth consideration of the reasons for this outcome and to illustrate
the challenges experienced by all the projects under APL2.

Reasons for Variation Orders and Cost Overruns

•   Design and construction of the Axum By-pass - The project road traverses a region
    with the historical town of Axum which is a registered UNESCO World Heritage site
    due to its archeological and historical value. The design review included an outline

                                               29
    description for protecting the archeologically sensitive areas from possible damages
    during construction. The decision to introduce a by-pass to the town was made at the
    procurement stage of the works, and it was indicated that design and construction of
    the bypass for Axum town would be undertaken during the construction phase. This
    was also indicated in the Contract Documents (addendum-2 of the bid documents and
    Volume-IV: cross section drawings); it was stipulated that the detail design of the
    alignment on the bypass would be carried out by the Supervision Consultant.
    Although the contract agreement states that provisional quantities are included for
    Axum by pass in the original design, it was noted during implementation that no
    quantities for the bypass were actually included in the original Bills of Quantities.
    Consequently, the Supervising Engineer had to quantify the works and estimate the
    costs. In the end 6.59 km long bypass with 7 m wide double carriageway (2 m wide
    Central Island and 4 m walkway on both sides) and pipe side drains were designed.
    The cost of civil works on this bypass is US$11.86 million.

•   Widening of carriageway in town sections – During construction local residents in 5
    towns along the project roads and their respective administrations requested for town
    sections to be widened in Shire, Selklaka, Wukromaray, Adiabun and Axum. The
    supervising consultant therefore recommended variation orders. See summary in
    Table 2.4 below. Of course the obvious question is why this was not carried out
    during project design. Consultation with local residents and completed engineering
    designs would have captured the need for widening in town sections and the extent of
    such widening. Thus averting the need for variation orders and associated disruptions

•   Other changes in engineering designs - From the start of the project, the dated
    designs resulted in various changes and modifications that affected the progress of
    work and had direct and indirect impacts on project costs (see figure below). These
    include:

          Wrong survey data and non-existent bench marks. The entire project road had
           to be re-surveyed since many of the benchmarks in project documents were
           either erroneous or non-existent. This affected the contractors progress and
           added to project costs.

          Drainage structures – several culverts and bridges had to be redesigned as the
           engineering designs supplied to the contractor missed out over 100 culverts
           and 18 bridges.

          Wrong alignments – in several locations the horizontal and vertical road
           geometry had to be redesigned with impacts on quantities on cuts and fill
           sections and hard/soft excavations.

          Treatment of road bed – further investigations were needed to establish
           accurate extents and treatment of areas with expansive soils.

          Extent of right of way in road alignment.

          Design for safety in accident black spots and mountainous road sections.

Status of the Project at ICR Mission

13.     Following the issuance of the variation order No. 1 (modification of the town
section design of Shire, Seleklaka, Wukromaray, Adiabun and construction of Axum by
pass) the Contractor has been granted an additional extension of time (682 Calendar
days) which revised the contract completion date of the project to June 30, 2012. The
contractor has now been awarded certificate of substantial completion. In accordance
with the Contract Agreement, the Contractor has provided assurance to finalize
outstanding project works before December 30, 2012. The Outstanding works include:

       Rectification of defective asphalt works
       Junction road construction in Seleklaka and Wukromaray towns
       Protection Works installation
       Remaining type A and B side ditches construction
       Road Marking and guardrail installation
       Additional culvert provision at two locations
       Shoulder treatment

Critical Review of Lessons from the Shire-Adiabun Case Study

14.     The detailed case study of Shire-Adiabun highlights the impact of decisions at the
early stages of project preparation on the final outcome of a project. The need to upgrade
this vital link was indisputable from the start of the RSDP. The Shire Adigrat Federal
road is vital for the economy of the region and the Nation as it provides connections for
the regions of Tigray and Amhara. It also completes the North-South circle to the Capital
Addis Ababa from both the Eastern and Western parts of the country. The roads along
this circle are a priority for the GoE and the final sections are under construction. Hence
it was fitting for the Shire-Adiabun road to be included as part of World Bank support to
the RSDP. The project is substantially completed and will serve the national interest and
the aspirations of the GoE. Nevertheless, the road has been delivered at a high cost. Some
of the reasons for the cost increase can be attributed to factors outside the control of any
party that participated in the identification, conception and implementation of the project.
However, a significant portion of these costs could have been averted by better
engineering design and project management. In this respect Shire-Adiabun road project
provides vital lessons for future schemes.

•   Realistic/market based cost estimates at appraisal and the tender process – the
    estimated cost of the Shire-Adiabun road at appraisal was US$25.46 million. A
    review of project documentation reveals that the estimate was based on designs
    carried out in 1997 – approximately 10 years before the project went out to tender. A
    design review was carried out in 2003, but the terms of reference where limited. As a
    result no investigations were carried out with regards to road geometry, hydrology,
    survey data, soil investigations, drainage structures, etc. Unsurprisingly, bids from
    contractors were 90-200 percent higher than the client’s cost estimate. This should
    have been a warning signal that the client’s cost estimates were grossly inadequate
    and should have prompted cancellation of the tender process and redesign of the

                                            34
    entire project; in spite of the political pressures to deliver the project. In the end the
    lowest bid was US$48.52 million.

•   Detailed Engineering design and the construction phase – fundamentally the root
    cause of the unrealistic estimates would have a more significant impact during the
    construction phase. As illustrated above the flawed designs had a detrimental impact
    on the project – it was delayed by 2 years and the final cost is approximately
    US$108.85 million. This translates to more than 300 percent above the original
    estimate. The variation orders worth US$25 million could have been avoided if the
    design involved proper consultation with the towns and synchronization with the
    urban master plans which were already in the preliminary stages of development. It
    was known from the start that a bypass round the heritage sites and town of Axum
    would have to be designed but this was not undertaken. Moreover, during tender,
    contractors were not even asked to offer a priced bid for the by-pass. Many of the
    other design changes were avoidable. The changes and associated delays attracted
    price adjustments worth US$36.4 million. It was fortunate that the contractor was not
    overly claims oriented and in the end withdrew several claims in exchange for
    extension of time. The basic lesson here is that having the engineering design
    advanced to a point were limited changes are required and information supplied to
    contractors is reliable is core to the projects outcome. More complete and reliable
    engineering designs also reduce the risk of disputes and claims during the
    construction phase.

•   Whole life performance of road infrastructure – From the site visit it was also
    evident that many of the solutions proposed during construction did not benefit from
    design based on analysis of whole life considerations. For example, the drains in the
    urban sections which were part of the variation orders have been completed covered
    with prefabricated slabs. Some of them have already been filled with debris from
    recent rains. It is unclear how these drains will be desilted and maintained after
    demobilization of the contractor. In several sections of the road, the choices of
    drainage design and road furniture also leaves questions about long term
    maintenance.

Economic and Financial Analysis at Appraisal

a) Economic Analysis

1.      For the identified national and regional road projects, the PAD explains that
specific traffic counts and projections, as well as preliminary engineering designs were
prepared to appraise their economic feasibility. The feasibility studies of the four main
roads were undertaken in November 1999 as part of the first phase of RSDP. The
feasibility studies for the rural roads under component 2 were carried out in September
2001. These studies on the economic viability of the roads were updated in December
2003. A discount rate of 10.23 percent has been used throughout the analysis.

Assumptions, Input Data and Methodology

2.     Traffic Levels: Table 3.1 below shows the Average Annual Daily Traffic for the
base year, for the project roads.

         Table 3.1 - Average Annual Daily Traffic in PAD –Base year (2002)

3.      Traffic Projections:      According to the Appraisal documentation, traffic
projections on project roads took into account past and future trends in GDP growth,
population increase, agricultural activities, tourism, average annual daily traffic, vehicle
fleet and fuel consumption. These are among the major factors influencing traffic growth
rates. Two sets of growth rates were estimated for 2003-2013 and 2014-2024.

4.      It was assumed that the base traffic would grow at fairly high rates but eventually
tapper off as the economy stabilizes to steady growth.

5.      Costs: Construction was assumed to start in 2005 and last for three years, thus
the roads would be open to traffic in 2008. An analysis period of 20 years was assumed.

6.     Methodology: The HDM 3 model (in HDM Manager) was used for the analysis.
The proposed option was compared with a “do minimum? case. The “do minimum case?
assumes that a minimum amount of maintenance of the existing road will be carried out.
The economic analysis is based on benefits to road traffic (in terms of savings in VOCs &
road maintenance costs) compared with the costs of rehabilitation/upgrading and
                                            36
maintenance. Discounted benefits are then compared to discounted costs to produce
measures of worth. Sensitivity analysis was done taking into account three scenarios
namely a 20 percent increase in costs, a 20 percent decrease in benefits and the worst
case (costs +20 percent & benefits -20 percent).

7.      Benefits: The proposed road rehabilitation/upgrading would have essential
benefits to the nation’s economy as well as to the environment including:
• Reduced vehicle operating cost (e.g. fuel consumption, maintenance cost)
• Reduced travel time
• Increased road safety
• Reduced noise and air pollution and
• Area development.

b) Financial Analysis

8.      The financial costs of construction and maintenance were estimated based on the
engineer’s client estimates and converted to economic costs by applying a conversion
factor of 0.83.

Economic and Financial Analysis at End of project

9.     During the ICR mission preliminary economic and financial analysis was carried
out in accordance with the framework established for M&E. The Borrower provided
input data for economic and financial analysis. Further analysis was undertaken by the
World Bank expert. Normal traffic was based on ERAs most recent classified traffic
count carried out at the end of 2011.

10.     The appraisal evaluation was done for rehabilitation and upgrading of four feeder
roads: (i) Magna-Mechara, (ii) Gob Gob–Weldiya (iii) Adwa/Adiabun-Shire, and (iv)
Assela-Goba/Shashemene-Dodola, and the construction of the Assosa-Sherkole-Goba
road to gravel standard. The ex-post economic evaluation was done for the rehabilitation
and upgrading of three feeder roads for which actual traffic data is available. Table 3.2
below shows the appraisal costs and Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the roads for
which an ex-post economic evaluation was done. The costs are given on ETB 2004

in poor condition with daily traffic ranging from 303 to 1,252 vehicles per day in 2002.
Table 3.3 below shows the project roads characteristics before the improvement works.
The roads were upgraded to an asphalt concrete standard with a 50 mm asphalt concrete
surface layer over a 25 mm base and 200 mm sub-base with a width of 7.0 meters.

15.     The ex-post evaluation was done first by replicating the appraisal economic
evaluation results using the Roads Economic Decision Model (RED) and then updating
the evaluation with: (i) actual upgrading costs and (i) actual annual traffic growth from
2002 to 2012. Table 3.7 below shows the ex-post Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for
each road and the appraisal estimates. The ex-post ERR for the first two roads decreased
to 15.7 and 17.2 percent respectively due to the lower actual traffic growth rate and
relatively high construction costs. The ex-post ERR of the Shire-Adiabun road decreased
to 27.8 percent because the increase in the upgrading costs was not compensated by the
increase in the annual traffic growth rate. All roads have an ex-post ERR above 10.23
percent threshold for infrastructure projects in Ethiopia.

Page 16, b)

1.      It is known that APL2 road projects were completed with considerably higher cost
than anticipated. Other than the changes in Design, this high costs were mainly due to the
turbulent of external environment with commodity price surges, global recession,
relatively high inflation, shortage of construction materials which forced to import from
outside.

2.      Given the above situation, it is not clear how the report concluded that the most
significant factors for high cost were within the control of ERA as a client.

Page 39, paragraph 15

3.      The report concluded that the decrease in ERR for Assela-Dodola-Goba,
Shashamane-Dodola and Gobgob-Gashena to 15.7 percent and 17.2 percent respectively
are due to lower actual traffic growth rate and high construction cost. However, the Bank
knows that because of the low traffic forecast assumed in previous studies for these road
projects, a change in the pavement wearing course from DBST to AC were proposed.
Therefore, the main reason for decrease in ERR values from appraisal estimates are
mainly due to the increase in costs and not low actual traffic growth rate.

       Annex 6. Comments of Co financiers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
1) Comments from EU

1.     Thank you for consulting the European Union on the Implementation Completion
and Results Report (your letter WB/CD/330/11/08/2012).

2.     We found many interesting information and we'll take in account the main
conclusions in the formulation of our Third Road Sector Policy Support Program (SPSP
3); we would like also to discuss about it in the next Transport Sector Working Group,
which should take place at the end of November.

3.     I would like to add some specific comments on some points raised in your report:

Design and cost estimation Versus Works Contracts

4.      This has been an issue since a long time. Almost each and every contract have had
a cost and time overrun mainly because of design issues and associated claims (cost and
time). ERA had started some time ago a performance appraisal mechanism of both
Consultants and Contractors for its government financed projects so as to enable itself
devise/formulate ways in decision making during tendering and implementation phases.
But this was limited to local contractors and consultants. And its effectiveness to date is
not known. So it is good to know how far this mechanism is adopted in the Bank's or
other donor's procedures as there are obviously limitations to do that.

5.       Moreover, it appears that since a couple years back the market is dominated by a
limited number of contractors (mainly Chinese) who are well established here in the
country and mainly government controlled corporations with subsidies from their
government (financial support) and with high comparative advantage in tendering. There
is also the issue of collusion on offers to influence/control tenders.

Capacity of ERA in Design and tendering

6.      Since recent years ERA follows a procedure where by designs are checked and
verified on site by its own staff but the capacity to mobilise its resources to each and
every design contract is limited.

High turnover of staff

7.      This has been an issue raised by most donors for decades in almost every annual
stakeholder's meeting but ERA's hand is tied due to the government regulations; no
matter how much it tried to improve its salaries to its staff and organisational structure it
is very clear that it could not reach at a comparable level/pace as the private sector. This
issue will definitely persist for some time to come. In one of the stakeholders meeting
ERA director General has clearly stated that they have no other choice but simply
continue recruiting new engineers when the experienced ones leave.

                                             43
2) Comments from DfID

A. On the Relevance of the Adaptable Programme Loan (APL2) Project

1.     We believe that supporting the road sector is key to growth and poverty reduction
in Ethiopia and the Adaptable Programme Loan (APL2) of the World Bank has been
contributing towards this end.

B. The ERTTP Project and its completion scoring

2.     As highlighted in the APL2 Implementation Completion and Results report, DFID
has been supporting the Ethiopian Rural Travel and Transport Programme (ERTTP) –
component 3 under the APL2 programme.

3.     The project was very instrumental in successfully demonstrating the impacts that
could be achieved by combining road provision with non-transport projects to improve
access and mobility. It has also enabled the development and dissemination of Low
Volume Roads Design Manual which would be useful for road works financed by other
interventions such as the Productive Safety Nets Programme (PSNP).

4.     The project was successfully completed and project completion report was
prepared by independent Consultants (see the attached).

5.    ERA has demonstrated commitment and leadership for the effective
implementation of the programme.

6.      So, based on the above considerations the consultancy team put the overall rating
of the project as “satisfactory?.

C. On the APL2 Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR)

7.      The report has clearly documented the project development objectives, key
factors affecting implementation, assessment at outcome level, etc. That is appreciated.

8.     It would have been great if the section analyzing the performance of the project
component by component clearly detailed the current status of the projects (what has
been achieved) compared to what is planned. For example, for the ERTTP component,
the report indicated what is expected under this project and does not show what has been
achieved. This would help enhance our understanding on which component work better
than others and what should be done to enhance performance in less performing
components.

9.     We found the lesson learning a bit thin and could be expanded. It might be good if
