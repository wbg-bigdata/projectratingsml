                         1.        Out of eight civil works contracts under APL2, five contracts have been substantially completed. The contracts which have been completed are : (i) two contracts under
                         Assosa Guba project completed in August 2010; (ii) one contract under Magna-Mechara project completed in March 2011; and (iii) two contracts contract under Woreta-Woldia
                         project completed between March and December 2011. Following substantial completion there has followed a 12 month defects liability period (DLP).

                         A further contract, Assela-Dodola Junction (116 km) was certified as substantially complete and handed over to ERA in November 2011. However, the mission notes that there
                         remains significant works to be completed in urban sections (e.g. walkways, vehicular and pedestrian accesses) as well as within inter-urban sections (e.g. bridge railing repairs,
                         treatment of spoiled material, grassing and reinstatement of borrow pits and quarries). The quantum of work remaining to be done during the DLP will be a challenging task,
                         particularly in view of the approaching rainy season and the credit closing date of 30 June 2012.

                         Dodola Junction-Goba (132 km) has been partly completed and 82 km was handed over to ERA in November 2011, although there is still outstanding works, including slope
                         protection, reinstatement of borrow and quarry sites and stabilization of large volumes of spoil material along the mountainous section, demanding intensive works before the mid-
                         year rainy season and the credit closing date.

                         The last works contract under this project, Shire-Adiabun (92 km), has some outstanding works including 1km of road works in Adwa town, 25km of concrete lined side drains,
                         rehabilitation of 5 bridges and installation of road furniture, all of which needs to be done prior to the closing date to maximize use of the remaining credit. Although the contractor
                         forecasts completion by November 2012 , which is well beyond the Credit closing date (June 30, 2012), during the mission the client held discussions with the contractor to explore
                         ways in which the remaining work could be accelerated in order to reach completion by June 30, 2012.

                         In regards to overall disbursements, as most of the major civil works are compete, disbursement has now reached 96% (as at April 6, 2012) showing an increase of 6% in the last six
                         months. It is likely that the remaining 4% of the credit (US$ 50 mil.) will be disbursed prior to the credit closing date.

                         2. With regard to technical assistance services (TA), all are complete except the Financial Management study, the contract for which was signed in September. The study is expected
                         to be completed in June 2012.

                         3.      Although many of the problems raised in previous missions have been addressed, poor quality of works in urban sections, uncontrolled spoiling, unprotected cut slopes and
                         inadequate attention to environmental and safety issues all remain of concern, and require enhanced supervision and close follow by ERA.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Three of the works contracts have been delayed and there is a substantial volume of outstanding works remaining to be completed before the Credit closing date of 30 June 2012.
                         This requires enhanced supervision and proactive follow-ups by ERA in order to ensure that outstanding works are completed and contractors comply with agreed contractual and
                         performance requirements in terms of quality, safety and environment protection works. This is indeed a big challenge for ERA considering the very limited time remained before the
                         Credit closing date.

                         Restructuring History
                         There has been no restructuring to date.
