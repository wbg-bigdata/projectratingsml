Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:          Korea Technology Development Corporation (KTDC)
Guarantor:         Republic of Korea
Loan Amounts       US$50 million equivalent
Terms:             11 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Terms:   KTDC would pass on the proceeds of the Bank loan to the
final beneficiaries using the following financial
instruments: (a) conventional loans to subborrowers with a
maximum term c. 10 years including three years grace at
interest rates which provide adequate spreads to KTDC;
(b) conditional loans that would provide KTDC with a
partial claim on sales revenues in the case of successful
projects but, if no sales revenues are generated, would
allow KTDC to recover only a portion (commonly 302) of the
loan; (c) equity participation in companies set up to
commercialize the results of research and development; and
(d) leasing of equipment (purchased with loan funds) for
use in industrial technology development projects. For at
least 802 of loan funds, the foreign exchange risk would be
borne by the subborrowers.  KTDC would, however, offer an
option to certain small- and medium-scale industries which
could pay KTDC a premium to bear the foreign exchange risk.
For the inherently risky equity investments and conditional
loans, KTDC would bear the foreign exchange risk.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION
AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO TEE KOREAN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
FOR A THIRD TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
*        1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
US$50 million to the Korea Technology Development Corporation (KTDC), with the
guarantee of the Republic of Korea, is submitted for approval. The proposed
*        loan would be for a term of 11 years including 5 years of grace at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate and would help finance a third technology
development project.
2.       Background.  Initially, Korea's impressive post-war industrial
development took advantage of superior labor produetivity and organization
skills. Since the early 1970s, the Government has recognized the need to
deepen the country's industrial base and to promote industrial technology
development (ITD). Consequently, science and technology infrastructure,
including facilities and programs for research, standards, testing, and
technical education, were developed and a range of fiscal incentives were
provided to industry for carrying out research and development (R&D). To help
finance ITD, KTDC was established in 1981. Since then, the Government has
liberalized restrictions on technology i-',orts and foreign investment, and
provided incentives for stimulating ventare capital investment. With Bank
assistance under two previous projects, KTDC has developed into the country's
leading financial agency for ITD.   In view of the important role that small-
and medium-scale industries (SMI) can play in many industrial subsectors, as
well as their growing demand for financing of ITD, KTDC's lending has
increasingly gone to SMI, which in 1986 received more than three quarters of
KTDC's total amount of financing. KTDC's success has in par- stimulated the
formation of venture capital companies and its expertise has )een widely
tapped by industry, prompting Government to delegate to KTDC responsibility
for appraising nationally-funded R&D projects. While KTDC is far less rigid
and conservative than much of Korea's financial sector, it has on'y recently
become venturesome in supporting an increasing proportion of higher-risk
projects.
.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Continued Bank support to KTDC is in
line with Bank recommendations to move Korean industrial policy away from one
in which the Government takes the lead in "picking winners" toward one which
emphasizes functional intervention in such areas as ITD and development of SMI
and venture capital, where market imperfections and externalities exist.
Assistance to KTDC complements Bank involvement in science and technology
education and support for SMIs, including technology extension. The Bank can
also help KTDC manage its transition from a mixed public-private enterprise
dependent on government support to a private finance company with limited
government assistance in an increasingly liberalized financial sector. For
its part, KTDC desires continued association with the Bank to gain advice on
divestiture procedures and to assist it in mobilizing increased private sector



- 2 -
funds. Bank involvement, although somewhat small in relation to KTDC's
overall operations, will be directed toward helping KTDC maintain its
leadership role as a model ITD financial institution. For the Bank itself,
experience gained in the course of KTDC's further development and the progress
of ITD in Korea would be useful in assisting other countries planning to
embark on similar efforts.
4.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would build on the
accomplishments of previous Bank projects aiding Korea to foster the
transformation of its industrial structure. The project aims to further
strengthen KTDC by helping the Corporation and its newly-established venture
capital subsidiary, the Korea Technology Investment Corporation (KTIC), to
expand gradually into projects with greater risk and to adjust to a changing
financial market and industrial environment.
5.       Project Description.  The project would consist of:  (a) financing
KTDC and KTIC lending to enterprises for the import, adaptation, and
development of industrial technology; (b) assistance to KTDC in upgrading its
project appraisal and supervision capabilities, especially for nrojects
involving risk-sharing financial instruments (i.e., conditional loans and
equity investment); and (c) assistance to KTDC in the development of KTIC.
The project would finance the costs of goods and services needed for
technology subprojects carried out by firms and financed by KTDC. The
majority would be imported, although locally-manufactured equipment purchased
by SMIs would also be eligible for partial financing. Project funds would
largely be on-lent on conventional terms which provide dn adequate spread to
KTDC. A small percentage of the loan is expected to be used for leasing
operations, and possibly, for conditional loans and equity investments.
Between 1988 and 191, KTDC's total financing would be US$633 million, of
which the Bank would provide nearly 10X. A breakdown of the financing plan is
presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement,
and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project procesaing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are
shown in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7019, dated January 20,1988 is also attached.
6.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with Government on
(a) exchanging views with the Bank on the conditions and transition
arrangements for the divestiture of KTDC; (b) providing KTDC with loans of
W 27 billion in 1988, ar.u (c) providing guarantees to KTDC debentures for W 10
billion in 1988. Agreement with KTDC has been reached on: (a) carrying out
the project in accordance with its key operating policy documents, including
the Institutional Policy Statement agreed at negotiations; (b) reviewing
annually with the Bank, various operational and financial plans and programs,
particularly, those for staff training, portfolio monitoring system, support
to SMI, interest rate policy, and the use of various financial instruments;
and (c) maintaining its debtlequity ratio within the maximum limit of 6:1.
In addition, the loan would be made effective after KTDC adopts the
Institutional Policy Statement.
7.       Benefits.  The proposed project would continue the institutional
development of KTDC under the country's changing regulatory,' policy, economic
and financial environment. It would also support more rapid ITD, especially
in SMIs and component industries of key subsectors like automobiles and



-3-
electronics manufacturing. The increased availability of funds by ITD would
encourage greater and earlier technological improvements and development in
Korea's most important industries thus maintaining the country's longer-term
industrial competitiveness.  The project would also encourage the continued
testing of various financial instruments for supporting ITD.
8.       Risks.  The-project involves no major risks.  KTDC management and
staff have shown the resolve and entrepreneurship to develop KTDC into a prime
ITD financing organization.  Regular exchange of views with the Bank in the
course of the project should aid in KTDC's adjustments to the changing
economic and financial environment. After government divestiture. continued
KTDC leadership in ITD financing would be safeguarded through the maintenance
of KTDC's existing policies.
9.       Recoumendation.  I dm satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

THIRD TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Procurement Method and Disbursements
Since most KTDC zabloans are relatively small (US$440,000 equivalent,
on average) and finance many hardware and software iters. available only from a
limited number of suppliers, procurement w=der the f.rqt and second Bank-
assisted ITD projects was carried out through internatianal or local shopping
in accordance with standard procedures acceptable to the Bank. This would be
continued under the proposed project and would apply to leasing operations as
well.
Disbursements
The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against: (a) 1002 of
foreign exchange expenditures for directly imported goods and services for
subloans, (b) 1002 of total expenditures for consulting services and overseas
training for KTDC, and (c) 602 of local expenditures for and services procured
locally for subloans. Item (c) would not be available for large corporations.
All subloans below US$250,000 equivalent as well as consulting services and
overseas training for KTDC would be disbursed against statements of
expenditures (SOEs). Related documents would be retained by KTDC and made
available for inspection by Bank supervision missions. Subloans for amounts
above US$250,000 equivalent would require full documentation. A special
account for US$5 million equivalent would be established to facilitate the
disbursement process.
