MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CEINA
FOR A DISEASE PREVENTION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 67 million, the equivalent of $100
million, on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance the Disease Prevention
Project. The Government of China would allocate $2.24 million equivalent of the proceeds of the
credit to its Ministry of Health (MOH) to carry out a National-level Component and would make
available $97.76 million equivalent of the credit proceeds to the: (a) provinces participating in the
Immunization Component at a fixed annual interest rate not to exceed 1.1 percent per annum for 20
years, including a grace period of 5 years; and (b) jurisdictions participating in the Health Promotion
Component at a fixed annual interest rate not to exceed 2.5 percent for 20 years, including a grace
period of 5 years. The provinces would make the proceeds available to their counties on a grant basis
or on terms at least as favorable as the terms on which they receive funds from the Borrower, and the
provinces would bear the foreign exchange risks. The jurisdictions would make the proceeds
available to their counties on the same terms as they receive the funds from the Borrower, and the
jurisdictions would bear the foreign exchange risks.
2.    Sector and Project Background. Since 1949, China's achievements in health have been
remarkable and by the 1980s reached mortality levels comparable to middle-income countries. The
1995 World Development Report (WDR) indicates that in 1993 China's average life expectancy at
birth was 69 years, compared to 62 years for low-income countries, and the infant mortality rate was
30 per 1,000 live births compared to 64 for low-income countries. A young and healthy adult
population gives China an overall burden of disease that is less than that found anywhere outside the
established market economies and the formerly socialist economies of Europe. China's successes in
disease prevention are based on achievements in improving educational standards, in lifting most of
the population out of absolute poverty and in creating a comprehensive network of health services
covering all counties. Specific health education and disease prevention programs were able to build
on the political and health systems established in China. Epidemic and endemic diseases, such as
plague, cholera, malaria, smallpox and schistosomiasis, which were uncontrolled in the first half of
this century, were reduced or even eradicated. Other infectious diseases, such as common childhood
respiratory and diarrheal illnesses and adult tuberculosis, while still important public health problems,
have been greatly reduced.
3.    With an increasing life expectancy, a declining overall rate of death and illness caused by
infectious diseases and a rapidly growing economy, China is now experiencing a dramatic health
transition. The proportion of older persons has been increasing fast and steadily: 12 percent of the
population will be 60 years or older by 2010 and 20 percent by 2030. Consequently, the disease
patterns have also undergone dramatic changes, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) already
account for over three-quarters of all deaths in China. The most important causes were heart
diseases, stroke, lung diseases, and cancer. The World Bank's last health sector reportl' indicated
that the annual probability of death from infectious disease for adult men and women in China (ages
15 to 60) was just over one percent; rural men had almost twice the chance of urban men of dying of
1' China: Long Termn Issues and Options in the Health Transition (No. 7965-CHA), 1990.



- 2 -
infectious disease (1.4 percent versus 0.7 percent); and rural women four times that of urban women
(1.4 percent versus 0.34 percent). In contrast, the death rate from chronic disease, injury and suicide
was almost 15 times greater for men and 10 times greater for women.
4.    Changing Risk Factors. Smoking, hypertension, poor diets, overweight and obesity and
pollution are becoming the most important health risk factors in modem China. Over 70 percent of
men and 7 percent of women smoke, making China the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, and
the consumption of cigarettes is growing. The prevalence of hypertension is also increasing: from
5.11 percent (or 30 million people) in 1959, to 7.73 percent (60 million) in 1979, and to 11.88
percent (90 million) in 1991. The rate is over 20 percent in some urban areas. Over 10 percent of
the Chinese population carry the hepatitis B virus. China's environmental pollution is very high,
contributing to a chronic obstructive lung disease rate that is among the highest in the world.
Industrial pollution, accidents and work related injuries are also high and rising. Finally, increased
mobility, economic freedoms and changing behavior have contributed to a very dramatic rise in
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in China. Though
still relatively very low in prevalence, the number of cases has been increasing very fast each year
with real potential for explosive growth.
5.    The Government is fully alert to the challenges and potential threats posed by NCDs, STDs
and HIV. On NCDs, the Government has prepared a National Outline of NCD Control describing its
strategies based on multi-sectoral involvement and primary prevention. The main approaches are to
include community-based prevention, training of general practitioners and improvements in primary
health care. Concerning STDs and HIV, the Government emphasizes preventive measures with four
main strategies: (a) information and education to promote safe sex and other healthy behavior and to
discourage intravenous drug abuse; (b) effective STD case management regimes to control the spread
of STDs/HIV; (c) screening of blood donations; and (d) promotion of condoms.
6.    Project Objective. The project has two objectives:
(a)    Prevent and control vaccine-preventable diseases to reduce morbidity, disability and
mortality, especially in the poorest provinces of China. This would be carried out by
improving the immunization services and by introducing policy measures to improve
vaccine quality and to ensure access of all population groups, and to add new vaccines
to the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI); and
(b)   Improve the capacity of the health sector to design and implement health promotion
programs to prevent and control the rising prevalence of NCDs, STDs, HIV and
injury. This would be accomplished through policy and institutional improvements
and by implementing pilot programs, including surveillance, staff training, health
education and other health promotion interventions, at selected locations.
7.    Project Description. The project comprises three main components: (a) immunization; (b)
health promotion; and (c) the national level programs. The Immunization Component would be
implemented in ten of the poorest provinces of the country -- Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei,
Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Xinjiang and Yunnan - and consists of four sub-components: (i)
cold chain improvement; (ii) health workers' training; (iii) management and surveillance; and (iv)
information, education and communication (IEC). A majority of cold chain equipment for storage
and transport of vaccines at all levels is now either damaged or approaching the end of its expected



service life. Any breakdown in the cold chain can seriously damage vaccine potency. To ensure the
sustainability of the immunization program, a 20-year needs assessment was prepared for new
installation and regular replacement of the equipment. The proposed project would finance the first
five years' requirements, including urgently needed replacements of aging equipment, new
installations in deficient areas, and spare parts and maintenance. The project would improve technical
and managerial skills of all staff involved in the immunization program at all levels of the epidemic
prevention network by establishing a system of regular in-service training. The management
improvement activities would include training, development of guidelines and manuals, improvements
in program supervision, monitoring, reporting of vaccine coverage, and measles and neonatal tetanus
surveillance. Finally, the sub-component for IEC would facilitate identification of behavioral factors
and attitudes that contribute to lower immunization coverage and implement a suitable
communications program to counteract these and to increase community awareness and participation.
8.    The Health Promotion Component would be implemented in seven cities spread throughout
the country -- Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Chengdu (Sichuan Province), Liuzhou (Guangxi Province),
Luoyang (Henan Province) and Weihai (Shandong Province), and to a more limited extent in Yunnan
Province. The project would be the first phase of a long-term plan to develop capacity and gain
experience in implementing effective health promotion strategies and interventions to control NCDs,
STDs/HIV and injury, as part of a comprehensive health policy. This component will consist of the
following sub-components: (a) institutional development and policy reform; (b) human resources
development; (c) surveillance; and (d) community-based interventions. The institutional development
and policy reform sub-component will improve institutional and coordination arrangements, help
mobilize multi-sectoral participation, and establish a policy environment for the behavior changes
necessary for reducing NCD, STDs/HIV and injury. The human resources development sub-
component would help improve knowledge and skills in health promotion for health workers and for
relevant personnel in non-health sectors and the community. This component would also help each
city to establish a sustainable system for surveillance of behavioral and environmental risk factors for
the target conditions and to improve monitoring and analysis of health trends. Finally, the
community-based intervention program would design, implement and evaluate a number of pilot
measures to control NCDs, STDs/HIV and injury in different settings such as schools, work-places
and neighborhoods as well as city wide. Yunnan Province, which has the highest concentration of
HIV/AIDS in China, would participate in the Health Promotion Component only with respect to the
prevention and spread of STDs[HIV, with policy reform, training and interventions to promote inter-
sectoral collaboration, increase community awareness, promote condom use and improve case
management of STD.
9.    The National-level Programs Component would provide necessary coordination among the
many provinces and cities and their health agencies involved in this project and would supervise and
monitor the progress of various components of the project. It would also be responsible to provide
technical assistance to project entities, to carry out activities of common interests and to eventually
disseminate the lessons learned from the project to other areas of the country. National level policy
guidance and leadership would be particularly important in developing new surveillance systems and
in health promotion human resources development. For the Health Promotion Component a network
of participating areas and the center would also be formed to share development tasks and ensure that
all can benefit from the existing experience and capacity in each location.
10.   Project Cost and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at $162.62 million including
taxes and contingencies. The proposed credit of $100 million equivalent would finance 62 percent of



the total project cost (100 percent of the total foreign exchange cost and 49 percent of local costs).
The provinces, cities and MOH would contribute the balance and annually make budgetary allocations
for the recurrent expenditures required during project implementation. The distribution of the credit
among the provinces, cities and MOH is based on the individual proposals and the justifications for
the investments. In order to facilitate an efficient and prompt start of the project, retroactive
financing of up to SDR 4.7 million ($7 million equivalent) is recommended to cover payments for
eligible expenditures after July 1, 1995. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, disbursement categories and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank loans and IDA
credits in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A project map (IBRD No. 27285) is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14912-CHA, dated November 8, 1995 is being
distributed separately.
11.   Project Implementation. The Ministry of Health would be responsible for overall
coordination, supervision and reporting requirements. A Project Leading Group has already been
established under the Minister of Health, and the MOH Disease Control Department has been
strengthened to enable it to provide technical leadership. The responsibility for implementing most of
the activities under the Immunization Component would lie with the concerned provincial health
bureaus and for the health promotion activities with the concerned city (and Yunnan Province) health
bureaus. The provinces' and the cities' organizational arrangements would mirror that of the central
levels.
12.   Project Sustainability. The additional recurrent cost requirements created by the new
investments have been estimated and then examined in relation to projected recurrent expenditure
constraints in health budgets. For the operating cost in the sixth year and thereafter, the project
jurisdictions would need a total of $4.93 million annually (RMB 40.9 million at a 1995 exchange
rate). Thus, the financial burden on the government will be quite negligible because this figure
represents only about one percent of the projected total recurrent government health budget of RMB
4.5 billion in 2000 in the project jurisdictions. The governments' willingness and ability to sustain
these costs are already demonstrated by increased contributions to preventive care in their health
budgets. Other measures including community risk sharing and user fees have been introduced in all
provinces, confirming that the incremental recurrent cost will be well within sustainable limits.
13.   Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned. Lessons learned from previous Bank Group
projects in China and elsewhere have benefited the design of this project. In addition, non-Bank
experience in the fields of immunization, communications, health promotion and management of
chronic diseases, HIV and AIDS has been considered. Close attention has been given to drawing
upon the Government's and other agencies' experience in relevant fields in China. The Bank Group
has supported six health projects in China since the early 1980s. Lessons learned from these projects
include the need to ensure: well-organized and adequately staffed project management offices at all
levels; advance planning to ensure adequate counterpart financing; and flexible project design that can
respond to changing circumstances, which is especially important in China's rapidly transforming
economy. The project design has fully taken these lessons into account. All provinces and cities
have already established project management offices, designated key staff, and provided full
commitment for budgetary provisions for necessary counterpart funding.
14.   There is a large storehouse of experience, both inside and outside China, on the design and
implementation of immunization programs. The major lessons considered in this project include: that



strong national commitment and target-setting can result in a high level of achievement, but there may
be a risk of over-reporting; that certain sections of the population (especially the poorest) can be
under-covered in the absence of special targeting; and that it is important to include an effective
communication strategy. The proposed project would not only strengthen China's immunization
surveillance system, but it would also include special cluster surveys. To respond to the need for
improved communications for the immunization program, the project would include a separate IEC
sub-component that would build on the experiences of similar projects in the Philippines, Bangladesh
and Ecuador.
15.   As China's experience in health promotion for the prevention of chronic diseases, STDs and
HIV is limited, the project draws heavily from the Bank Group and other international agencies'
worldwide experience. On chronic diseases, the project design has benefited from the international
findings of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the successful Finnish and
Australian experience. The behavioral risk factor assessment, the IEC programs and on-site
intervention programs will all benefit from such experience. In HIV/AIDS prevention, Bank Group
experience in Brazil, Burkina Faso, India, Uganda, Zaire and Zimbabwe has particularly guided the
development of the following project components: (a) surveillance and evaluation; (b) institutional
development for inter-sectoral coordination and improved program management and laboratories' staff
skills; and (c) improved management of STDs. Finally, based on the lessons learned, attempts were
made to keep the project design simple and flexible.
16.   Rationale for IDA Involvement in the Project. The proposed project reflects the Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy presented to the Board on June 1, 1995. The overall strategy
for China emphasizes poverty alleviation and human resource development, and the health sector
strategy focusses on helping the Government to meet basic health needs, particularly in poor areas,
and to reinvigorate initiatives on disease prevention. The project would support attainment of all of
these goals. In addition, as a result of the Association's involvement in the project, the provincial
allocations for immunization will increase substantially, reversing the recent years' trends of declines
in disease prevention budgets. Finally, IDA's involvement will enable China to benefit from the best
international technical knowledge and practices that were otherwise difficult to access. This is
especially relevant in the case of health promotion to control chronic and non-communicable diseases,
STDs and HIV, where China's experience is extremely limited.
17.   Agreed Actions. Assurances have been obtained from the Borrower that it would make
Project Implementation Arrangements (PIAs) with at least seven out of the ten provinces participating
in the Immunization Component and at least five out of eight entities participating in the Health
Promotion Component, as a condition of credit effectiveness. Making PIAs with each remaining
entity would be a condition of disbursement for that entity's respective part of the project. For the
Immunization Component, the PIAs would, inter alia, require the provinces to: (a) make available
the credit proceeds to its counties, as far as possible on a grant basis, otherwise on terms at least as
favorable as the terms on which they receive funds from the Borrower; (b) continue to provide
throughout the project period free EPI vaccines to cover the whole population; (c) prepare a long-
term strategy for cold chain replacement with a view to its adoption after the project period; (d) make
special efforts to increase immunization access to the poorest families, and carry out six rounds of
vaccination sessions each year; and (e) procure only reusable syringes and needles consistent with the
recommended policy of the World Health Organization (WHO), and ensure that all syringes and
needles are sterilized and disposed of in a manner consistent with this policy. For the Health
Promotion Component, the PIAs would require each city and Yunnan Province to, inter alia: (a)



- 6 -
submit its annual plans and proposals for implementation of the health promotion interventions,
including its plan to reduce smoking, to the MOH so that the Ministry can fumish the Association
with the summary, in a manner satisfactory to the Association; (b) ensure that the treatment of STD
and HIV patients is based on the policy of anonymity; and (c) provide training to private practitioners
treating STD and HIV patients. In addition, the Borrower would be required to: (a) as a condition of
disbursement of the Health Promotion Component, employ a consulting institution to benefit project
areas from the international best practices in health promotion, with qualifications, experience, and
temis of reference satisfactory to the Association; and (b) not later than December 31, 1998, furnish
to the Association a report of a mid-term evaluation carried out by the Borrower to further the
project's objectives, in accordance with guidelines acceptable to the Association.
18.   Poverty Category. The proposed project is a Program of Targeted Interventions, geared to
increase the access, coverage and quality of immunization coverage throughout ten of China's poorest
provinces, especially in rural and poor urban areas. Such disadvantaged areas are presently under-
served; they will benefit particularly from the new immunization programs, which are designed to
reach those who currently have the least access to satisfactory immunization services. All Chinese
provinces were ranked on the basis of income, percentage of population under the poverty line and
disease incidence, and the ten provinces ranked as the most disadvantaged under these criteria were
selected for the project. The population in the project areas has a significantly larger proportion of
poor people than China's population as a whole. The expected improvements in protection against
mortality and morbidity caused by measles, polio, pertussis, diphtheria and tuberculosis will most
directly benefit about six million infants born each year.
19.   Environmental Aspects. The environmental category assigned to this project is "C". The
project would have no adverse environmental impact, although the immunization program would add
to the total amount of needles and syringes that would have to be collected and disposed.
Participating project provinces will collect and dispose of needles and syringes separately from
general household wastes using special procedures in accordance with WHO's recommended policy.
Compliance with the WHO-recommended practice is a condition of each province's participation in
this project. Training in disinfection and destruction of needles and syringes to be discarded is
included in the project as well. The Health Promotion Component is expected to contribute to
significantly better urban environments because of the health education programs, particularly those
involving smoking bans and cessation campaigns.
20.   Participatory Approach. Stakeholder involvement in the preparation process has been very
high. First, each of the ten provinces prepared proposals for the Immunization Component, based
upon county proposals and other inputs from the lower levels. Similarly, each of the seven cities
(and Yunnan Province) prepared its plans under the Health Promotion Component. Most of the
provinces and cities were visited by joint teams from MOH and IDA for discussions. Finally, three
comprehensive project preparation and review workshops were carried out for each of the two main
components. These workshops provided forums and opportunities for: (a) thorough examinations of
the findings and recommendations of the joint MOH-IDA missions; (b) exchange of views among the
local officials and between the Chinese and international experts; and (c) provision of feedback to the
MOH and IDA teams to improve the project design. At the province, city and county levels, the
project proposals were developed through a consultative process, with leading and technical groups
having representation of health, finance and planning sectors, and community and local government
leaders. These groups will remain active in monitoring and guiding project progress. Planning of
specific health promotion interventions in different settings will require leadership and participation of



-7 -
local groups, with coordination, training and other technical support from the city health bureaus.
21.   Project Benefits. Through its Immunization Component, the project would most directly
benefit about six million infants born each year in ten of China's poorest provinces by more
effectively protecting them against mortality and morbidity caused by measles, polio, pertussis,
diphtheria, tetanus and tuberculosis. The project will also make tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B
vaccines more accessible to families, thus reducing the risk of death due to neonatal tetanus and
protecting the population from the long-term consequences of hepatitis B infection. The main
beneficiaries would be those who currently have the least access to satisfactory quality immunization
services. The project will not only help China narrow the health gaps between the poor and rich and
between urban and rural populations, it will also help significantly to reverse the declines in resource
allocations to preventive health care that have resulted in reduced coverage and quality of
immunization in China. The project also includes specific interventions designed to improve planning
and management capacity of the national, provincial, and county governments to prepare and
implement immunization programs, hence reducing unnecessary wastage of vaccines. The project
addresses the need for periodic in-service training, operational costs of preventive programs and
program management and, at least in part, alleviation of the problem of inability to pay for essential
disease prevention services, all of which are expected to demonstrate to government the value of
maintaining such recurrent costs.
22.   Through the Health Promotion Component, the project will spearhead a program to improve
China's capacity to develop and implement effective measures to control and prevent NCDs, STDs,
HIV/AIDS and injury. It would benefit the entire population of seven major cities, and to a more
limited extent Yunnan Province, through exposure to health promotion policies and programs.
Eventual benefits would accrue to residents of other areas as the project experience spreads. The
project's benefits will be greatest for those with behavioral risk factors for chronic diseases or STDs,
HIV/AIDS, and those in work-places or other locations with specific intervention trials. The project
would help combat STDs, which is one of the most effective strategies for inhibiting the spread of
HIV. Similarly, the project is expected to help control rising trends in mortality and morbidity from
a number of chronic diseases over the long-term, following implementation of a strategy to decrease
smoking, alcohol consumption and unhealthy diets, and following improvement of a clinical response
capability for related diseases. Added gains in efficiency and more effective care will result from the
improved professional training and health services management techniques provided through the
project. These measures will significantly contribute to control China's health expenditures in the
long run.
23.   Risks. A number of measures have been built into the project design to minimize the effects
of possible risks foreseen at this stage. First, there is a risk that some provinces or cities will not
provide adequate counterpart financing for the project. The central Ministry of Finance (MOF) is
aware of this risk and therefore has taken the initiative to announce that no province or city would be
allowed to participate in the project unless MOF is fully satisfied that the funding arrangements have
been agreed at the appropriate level and budgetary provisions have been made. The provinces and
the cities are highly motivated to reverse the recent decline in disease prevention activities by taking
advantage of the technical and financial resources that would be obtained from the proposed project.
Therefore, this risk is not considered excessive. Second, there is a risk that the coordination and
implementation of the project activities would be inadequate. To minimize this risk inherent in a
project with multiple components, all key project coordination and implementation arrangements have
been put in place and key staff have been recruited. Third, there is a risk that the jurisdictions



- 8 -
participating in the Health Promotion Component will not have adequate technical guidance for
capacity building and program implementation. To minimize this risk, a strong National-level
Component has been included in the project, MOH has established a separate Health Promotion
Division in its Disease Control Department (DCD), and arrangements have been made to contract a
team of international consultants to advise DCD as well as the project jurisdictions on a regular basis.
Fourth, there is a risk that the program implemented under the project would not be sustained. As
stated (para. 12), this risk has been kept within an acceptable limit. Finally, there is a risk that the
poorest and migrating ("floating") families may not be able to fully benefit from the improved
immunization program. Although special care has been taken to ensure that the provinces incorporate
specific measures to prevent this risk, the situation will be continuously monitored through regular
reporting and special studies.
24.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
