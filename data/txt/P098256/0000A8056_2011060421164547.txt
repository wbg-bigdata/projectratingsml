                         This interim ISR is based on the third and fourth quarter progress reports submitted by the project to the Bank. The formal Implementation Support Mission (ISM) will take place from
                         June 14 - 29, 2011. At the end of the ISM this ISR will be updated and the Aide Memoire and Management Letter will be attached. Overall, the Horticulture and Livestock Project
                         (HLP) has made remarkable implementation progress since the last supervision mission of October 2010. Both the implementation and progress towards achieving its development
                         objective are satisfactory. The HLP's achievements between October 2010 and March 2011, in terms of increasing productivity and production can be summarized as follow: (a)

                         received training from extension workers. The project developed 12 extension messages according to the Farmer Field School (FFS) principles. According to the 2010 outcome
                         monitoring survey, about 90 percent of the of participating female poultry producers adopted improved production practice. Farmers continue to contribute 25 percent of the costs of
                         production, which indicates that they value the quality of services and benefits provided by the project.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The closing date of the HLP is December 31, 2011. The total cost of HLP is US$55.7 million, which includes IDA grant of US$21.82 million and ARTF grant of US$34.3 million. By
                         March 31, 2011, about US$39.3 million were disbursed (approximately 71 percent of the total costs), leaving a balance of US$15.82 million. Out of this, only US$4.5 million are
                         available for project implementation to the closing date. In view of this, the Government of Afghanistan has requested the Bank to consider its request for project extension with
                         additional financing. This request will be discussed during the upcoming ISM.
