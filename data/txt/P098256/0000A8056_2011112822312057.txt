                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Overall, the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) has made remarkable implementation progress in the last two years. Both the implementation and progress towards achieving
                         its development objective are now satisfactory. The HLP's achievements for the last 12 months (between October 2010 and September 2011), in terms of increasing productivity and
                         production can be summarized as follow: (a) on the average, 52 percent of target farmers have adopted the introduced improved horticulture practices in focus districts (slightly
                         exceeding the target of 50 percent); (b) 66 percent of target farmers (all women) adopted the introduced improved poultry husbandry practices in focus districts (exceeding the target
                         of 60 percent); (c) about 1,050 hectares of new orchards were established in focus districts, which brings the cumulative new plantings to 3,187 hectares (representing 106 percent of

                         doing well; and (f) 424 male horticulture producer groups and 358 female poultry groups received training from extension workers. The project developed 12 extension messages
                         according to the Farmer Field School (FFS) principles. According to the 2010 outcome monitoring survey, about 90 percent of the participating female poultry producers adopted

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The current closing date of the HLP is December 31, 2011. The total cost of HLP is US$56.8 million, which includes an IDA grant of US$22.5 million and an ARTF grant of US$34.3
                         million. The IDA grant has been fully disbursed, while about 84 percent of the ARTF grant has been disbursed as of November 2011. The balance of US$ 5.6 million is expected to
                         be fully disbursed by mid January 2012.
