REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA
FCIR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$4.0 million to
help finance a second education project. The loan would be on standard
Third Window terms of 25 years, including a grace period of 7 years, with
an interest rate of 4-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Liberia in March 1973.   Its
report "Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic Economic Report"
(No. 462a-LBR dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the Executive
Directors. An updating report entitled "Liberia: Economic Memorandum"
(No. 873-LBR dated September 15, 1975) has also been distributed subse-
quently. Country data sheets are contained in Annex I.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings, and contribute a sizeable share of
government revenues and wage employment. Iron ore mining is by far the
largest single activity in the enclave sector, accounting for about three-
quarters of value-added. There are only limited linkages between the
enclaves and the rest of the economy. As a result, the benefits of growth
have beenunevenly distributed. Annual repatriation by foreigners of profits
and savings is equivalent to about 20 percent of gross domestic product.
4.        Traditional agriculture, at the other extreme, has minimal
interaction with the monetized economy; however, it supports the majority
of the population -- perhaps as much as 70 percent. About 4 percent of
Liberians have per capita income levels above US$3,000, while the vast
majority live at near subsistence level with average incomes of less than
US$100 per annum. To help redress this imbalance the Government is trying
to increase its earnings from the concessions and use the resources to
diversify the economy withi increased participation of Liberians.
Development Plan
5.        In order to achLeve these objectives the Government has prepared
a four-year Development PLan covering the period from July 1, 1976 to
June 30, 1980. In the preparation of the Plan, it was assisted by a
planning team financed joLntly by the Bank, UNDP, USAID and the Government

(Reference President's Memorandum to the Executive Directors, No. R74-61
dated March 25, 1974). The Plan identifies the basic, long-term objectives
of Liberia's socio-economic development as: (a) diversification of
production; (b) dispersion of sustainable socio-economic activities through-
out the country; (c) total involvement of all Liberians in the development
effort; and (d) equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth
and diversification so as to ensure an acceptable standard of living to
the people throughout the country.
6.        The Development Plan attaches a high priority to agriculture as
the cornerstone of the Government's diversification strategy. The objective
here is to diversify and modernize agricultural production, increase
productivity, improve associated rural economic activities such as marketing
and processing, and provide social and physical infrastructures to improve
the quality of life in the rural areas where most Liberians live.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries,
was hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong
world demand for Liberia's major exports brought large gains in export
prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries signifi-
cantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export commodities
-- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance continuing to be
largely a function of enclave activities, real growth of GDP -- which
averaged 5.9 percent a year in the 1964-1973 period -- dropped to 3 percent
in 1974 and came almost to a halt in 1975.
8.        However, because of good fiscal management, government finances
did not come under pressure. In 1974, revenues grew by 20 percent and,
despite increased government spending, an overall budgetary surplus of
US$15 million was realized. In 1975, revenues increased by 10 percent over
1974 and recurring expenditures by 12.5 percent, the latter largely reflecting
the effects of imported inflation on public expenditure. The following
factors enabled the Government to manage its finances despite a deceleration
of the economy: (a) the renegotiation of concession agreements that
improved Liberia's share of the profits; (b) a further increase in the new
contract prices for iron ore (in 1975 prices were on the average 55 percent
higher than in 1974); and (c) higher maritime revenues from vessel regis-
tration under the Liberian flag of convenience.
Balance of Payments
9.        Since Liberia uses US dollars as the medium of exchange, balance
of payments analyses are at best tenuous. In the 1964-1972 period exports
grew at 10 percent and imports by 5.9 percent annually. Thereafter, from
1972-1974, following accelerated international inflation, imports rose by
29 percent annually, exceeding the export growth of 22 percent a year. Oil
imports increased from US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974, and
US$47 million in 1975. Nevertheless, Liberia achieved a trade surplus of
US$96 million in 1974 and about US$75 million in 1975.



- 3 -
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was
estimated at about IJS$168 million as of December 31, 1975. The debt
service ratio was 4.8 percent in 1975, as compared to 5.3 percent in 1974
and 7.2 percent in 1972. The ratio is projected to fall further in the
next few years as the final portions of the heavy debt incurred in the
early 1960s are paid off. The proportion of outstanding debt owed to the
Bank/IDA is currently about 15 percent. Even with an expanded public
borrowing program Liberia's debt service ratio through the 1980s is
expected to remain relatively modest unless there is an unexpected deterio-
ration in external conditions. However, it should be remembered that
Liberia's exports are highly concentrated in a few commodities (mainly iron
ore and rubber) with notoriously unstable world market prices. Its
balance of payments is therefore essentially as vulnerable as that of most
mono-crop economies. Moreover, given the fact that the vast majority
(over 90 percent) of Liberians live at near subsistence level with average
incomes of less than US$100 per annum, and taking into account the country's
satisfactory performance in economic management, Liberia is considered
eligible for Third Window loans from the Bank.
PARr II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank Group has made 11 loans for projects in Liberia totaling
US$60.2 million; 4 IDA credits totaling US$17 million; and one technical
assistance grant of UJS$200,000 for development planning (paragraph 5). IFC
has made one equity Lnvestment of US$250,000 in the share capital of the
Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI). The Bank loans have
been for roads, port expansion, power and LBDI. IDA credits havp been for
education and agricuLture. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as at March 31, 1976, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:   (a) to help increase
the absorptive capaci.ty of the economy and enable Liberians to take greater
initiative in developing their own resources for the benefit of their own
people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to a broader sharing
of the fruits of econ!omic progress; (c) to help the Government in broadening
the economic base; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development
resources for sound projects from other external agencies.
13.       The proposed Second Education Project would help promote these
objectives by: (a) improving access to education for rural children and
adults, (b) improving the quality and expanding the output of trained primary
school teachers, and (c) strengthening education administration and planning.
In addition, a DFC project has been appraised and is expected to be sub-
mitted to the Executive Directors in the next few months. An agricultural
development project for Bong County to be co-financed with USAID, a technical
education project, a rubber rehabilitation project benefiting small indigenous
plantations, and a forestry development project are under preparation.

PART III: THE EDUCATION SECTOR
Background
14.       The education sector is inadequately developed and suffers from
an uneven geographical distribution of school places and weaknesses in
administration and planning. Public and private investment in educational
facilities was traditionally concentrated in Monrovia and the south-eastern
counties of Sino and Maryland. Despite some progress made over the past
ten years in expanding education facilities to previously neglected areas
of the country, educational oportunities are still unequally distributed.
For example, the six north-western counties (excluding Monrovia) still have
average primary enrollment ratios of about 40 percent, compared with an
average of over 70 percent for Monrovia and the south-eastern counties (see
map). At the secondary level, over 60 percent of those who complete grade
12 come from schools in Monrovia.
15.       The Ministry of Education is responsible for primary, secondary
and technical education. It suffers from administrative weaknesses, short-
ages of well-qualified staff and inadequate budgetary allocations. The
education and training budget of about US$13.3 million in 1974 was equal to
about 14 percent of the national budget and 2.7 percent of GDP -- a relation-
ship which is low relative to that in many other developing countries. The
bulk of the budget is absorbed in staff salaries and the remaining funds
are insufficient to provide an adequate supply of teaching materials and
equipment.
Manpower Planning and Training
16.       The education and training system is not producing sufficient
Liberians with the technical, managerial and administrative skills to man
the economy at current levels of activity. At the same time, the Government's
development plans, particularly for the rural areas, are constrained by the
limited supply of trained manpower and by weak local administration. A start
has been made under the first education project to determine manpower needs
as a basis for planning in education and training.
17.       In pursuit of a rational manpower development policy, the Govern-
ment has: (a) established a manpower planning unit within the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Affairs which is developing essential statistical
reporting and evaluation systems; (b) created a Civil Service Agency through
which it has inaugurated a program of public sector job classification, an
examination of the civil service structure, and a review of the entire
structure of public sector remuneration with a view to establishing a public
service career with an effective and equitable system of incentives; and
(c) established an Institute of Public Administration for purposes of upgrading
middle and upper-level manpower in the public sector by offering training
courses and by providing consulting and advisory services to Government
ministries in a variety of subject areas.



-5-
18.       The shortage of Liberians to manage the economy has been com-
pensated for in the past decade by technical assistance from USA and inter-
national agencies. This has been concerned primarily with manning the
economy rather than ulth training Liberian replacements, and Liberia remains
heavily dependent upon foreign technical assistance. Unit costs of such
experts have increased significantly in recent years. The measures required
to train more Liberians to man the economy include a more positive approach
than in the past on the part of Government and technical assistance personnel
to counterpart training and fellowship schemes and support for education
and training projects in Liberia.
19.       In its plans for manpower development, the Government is particularly
concerned with training Liberians for public and private sector jobs   in
skills that will bring immediate benefits, notably those associated with
exploiting the country's agricultural, mineral and forestry resources. Th!s
approach is sound, as economic diversification and a more efficient management
of resources are esseatial for the continuous growth of the economy over the
long term.
20.       In December 1975, the Government established a National Council
for Vocational and Technical Education and Training to: (a) plan, coordinate
and set policy for aLL Liberian public and private sector programs of voca-
tional training, technical education and industrial skills training; (b) for-
mulate guidelines and procedures for institutions operating vocational and
technical education and training programs; (c) recommend the allocation of
funds for training programs; and (d) establish vocational training standards,
testing procedures and criteria for certification. This important step,
which places responsibility for vocational training in the Ministry of Labor,
should result in clarifying the differentiation between vocational training
and technical education.  The Council will oversee the creation of an
apprenticeship system for which legislation is being prepared and will include
representation from thle Ministries of Planning and Economic Affairs, Labor
Youth and Sports, Education, Agriculture, the labor unions and employers.
Development Strategy
21.       The Government's educational strategy includes the following
features: (a) an increase in Government's responsibility for providing
physical facilities, trained teachers and an appropriate curriculum for
primary schools; (b) closer links between secondary schools and the Liberian
labor market; (c) establishment of a program of vocational and technical
training relevant and responsive to the country's manpower requirements;
(d) provision of increased opportunities for literacy among-adults as part
of a broad national effort to improve rural productivity and living standards;
(e) training of middle-level forestry staff required for the development
of the country's forestry resources; and (f) improvements in educational
administration and planning at both central and county levels.



- 6 -
22.      At the primary level, a community schools program is being imple-
mented to improve education in rural areas. This program provides improved
physical facilities for primary schools that can also serve as adult literacy
centers in the evening. Through this program the Government hopes to raise
the national enrollment ratio for the 6-11 age group from about 60 percent
in 1974 to about 80 percent by 1985; special efforts are being made to
improve the ratio for girls which at present is 36 percent of total enrollment.
23.      At the secondary level, the Government plans to expand science and
practical subject content and will evaluate the impact of the two multilateral
high schools financed under the First Education Project. Institutions offering
technical education and vocational training would place emphasis on developing
links with private and public employers. The Government plans to establish
a center for vocational training in Monrovia to offer basic training and skill
upgrading courses in the electrical, mechanical and building trades. In
adult education, the Government would focus on promoting literacy, using part-
time teachers and community schools.
24.      In higher education, the Government has recently completed a develop-
ment plan for the University of Liberia. It is now reviewing the manpower
and financing implications of the plan. The issues to be resolved are:
(a) the feasibility of moving the main campus out of Monrovia, and (b) a
choice between consolidation and expansion in the number as well as in the
range of disciplines offered.
25.      The Ministry of Education is engaged in improving its organizational
structure and cost effectiveness of government expenditures. Also, to make
the education system relevant to the needs of the country, it is devoting
attention to curriculum development, educational testing and the production
of teaching materials.
26.      Government's strategy combines a modest expansion of facilities
for the period 1976-1980 with project preparation and planning for later
years. Specifically, the Government plans to expand the community schools
program, strengthen the Ministry of Education and introduce more practical
and relevant programs at all levels of education and training in the country.
The proposed second education project would assist the Government in attaining
its objectives.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project Background
27.      The First Education Project (Credit 305-LBR of May 1972) financed:
(a) constructing, furnishing and equipping two rural multilateral secondary
schools, expansion of a rural primary teacher training institute and con-
struction of a new College of Agriculture and Forestry; (b) equipment for
science eduation and technical teacher training; and (c) technical assistance
for manpower and educational planning, project administration, technical
teacher training and secondary education and fellowships for educational and



manpower planning. The implementation of this project has been slow due to
difficulties in selecting suitable architectural consultants, in reaching
agreement on designs and in following satisfactory bidding procedures for
civil works. The problems have been resolved, and implementation is now
proceeding satisfactorily. The first of the construction contracts has been
awarded; and the full project is expected to be completed by around March
1978, about six months behind the original schedule,
28.       The proposed Second Education Project would provide US$4.0 million
to assist in: (a) supporting a community schools program which aims to improve
access to and quality of primary education and adult literacy in rural areas;
(b) strengthening educational administration,particularly in improved admini-
strative systems and procedures and in ability to re-orient the education
system towards local needs; and (c) preparing future projects in vocational
and forest ranger training. The project was identified by the Government and
the Bank and prepared joinatly by the Government, UNESCO and the Bank. The
project was appraised in November 1975,and the Appraisal Report entitled
"Appraisal of a Second Education Project in Liberia", No. 1036b-LBR dated
May 13, 1976 is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A loan and project summary is given in Annex III to this report. Negotiations
for the proposed Third Window loan were held in Washington on April 19-23,
1976,with the Liberian delegation led by Mr. Gerald Padmore, Deputy Minister
of Finance.
Project Description
29.       The proposed project comprises:
(a) assistance to the community schools program by providing for;
(i)   const:ruction, furnishing and equipping of 100 primary
school units in about 50 villages and the expansion
and improvement of a rural teacher training institute;
10 mun-years of technical assistance and 12 man-years
of fellowships in primary teacher training;
(ii)  2 man-years of technical assistance, 10 man-years of
fellcwships and equipment to establish an efficient
administrative system for adult education; and
(iii) 2-1/2 man-years of specialist services, equipment and
supplies to evaluate the program.
(b)  strengthening of the Ministry of Education by providing
for:
(i)   minor works for preparing a building for textbook produc-
tion;
(ii)  14-1!2 man-years of technical assistance, 12 man-years
of specialist services, 25 man-years of fellowships,
equipment and supplies to effect administrative reform,



and improve curriculum development, testing, textbook
production, planning, project administration and a
feasibility study on educational broadcasting; and
(c) preparation of future projects by providing:
(i)   1-1/2 man-years of technical assistance for vocational
planning and 4 man-years of fellowships in the training
of forest rangers;and
(ii) funds for architectural studies and design work on two
training centers - one for tradesmen and craftsmen, the
other for forest rangers.
Community Schools Program
30.       The project would provide 100 units of about 2,250 square feet each
for replacing,or adding to,existing primary schools or establishing new
primary schools in about 50 villages located in the counties of Bong, Lofa,
Cape Mount, Grand Bassa, Nimba and Montserrado where enrollment ratios are
lowest in the country. This would provide about 12,000 places and increase
enrollments by 4,000. The Zorzor Rural Teacher Training Institute (ZRTTI) would
be improved and expanded by provision of a new 70-place women's hostel, 3 new
staff houses, a new agricultural workshop and improvement to existing staff
houses, demonstration school, teaching spaces for home economics, arts
and crafts and biology/agricultural science and electricity and water supply.
Five expert teacher trainers for two years each would replace departing
bilateral volunteer staff until Liberians trained on fellowships have returned.
A new curriculum reflecting the rural and literacy concerns of the community
schools program would be introduced and the Institute's extension service
strengthened for more systematic liaision with primary schools and the com-
munity. The adult education service of the Ministry would be strengthened
through technical assistance, vehicles for transport and audio-visual teaching
equipment to supervise and guide the village literacy centers. Ten Liberians
would be trained under fellowships to serve as county adult education super-
visors. The project would also finance the evaluation of the entire community
schools program.
Strengthening of the Ministry of Education
31.       The Ministry of Education does not now reach the rural areas with
effective educational and administrative services. The project would assist
the Ministry of Education in a thorough review of its structure and organi-
zational procedures and methods of operation. The Institute of Public
Administration would conduct the review and would recruit specialists financed
by the project to assist in this. The project would also provide fellowships
for training in key areas of procurement and financial management and equip-
ment for establishing a personnel records system and vehicles for transport
of supplies. The project would strengthen the Ministry's capacity to improve
relevance and raise standards of education by expediting curriculum develop-
ment, expanding its testing program and producing suitable textbooks.



- 9 -
Specialist services, fellowships, equipment and supplies would be financed
for these purposes. Thus, the ability of the Ministry of Education to
provide better educational and administrative services and deliver them to
all parts of the country would be improved. The project would also provide
necessary expert services to: (a) finalize the long-range education plan
now at an advanced stage of preparation; (b) conduct an educational broad-
casting feasibility study as a possible future option in formal and non-
formal rural education; anad (c) assist in project administration and
fellowships for training educational planners.
Preparation for Future Projects
32.       The project wouLd finance:  (a) architectural studies for two
training centers -- a vocational training center in Monrovia and a forest
ranger training center; (b) technical assistance to plan the development of
vocational training, including the center, and to assist in launching the
newly established Nationa:L Council for Vocational and Technical Education
and Training; and (c) feLlowships for orest ranger training, Preparation
work will be carried out on these two training centers for possible inclusion
in future projects.
Project Implementation
33.       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) established under the
Ministry of Education for the first project would be responsible for the
execution of the second project. The second project would thus benefit
from the experience PIU has gained in Bank Group project implementation
procedures. PIU would be assisted by staff in the government ministries
and agencies concerned with the second project. The Ministry of Labor Youth
and Sports and the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs would each assign
liaison responsibilities to an official for vocational training; the Ministry
of Agriculture would do the same for forest ranger training and the various
divisions of the Ministry of Education would do the same for the relevant
project components. This would ensure full integration of the project with
on-going operations wherever applicable. The Unit would be staffed by a
director, two deputy directors, an architect, an accountant and other support
personnel. The proposed loan would include a provision for 30 man-months of
technical assistance for the services of the architect and one of the deputy
directors.
Project Costs and Financing
34.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$5.4 million,
net of taxes and customs duties, with an offshore component of US$4,0
million. The proposed Third Window loan would finance the entire foreign
exchange component representing 74 percent of the total cost of the project
net of taxes and duties. The Government of Liberia would provide US$1.43
million, or 26 percent of total project cost, to finance local expenditures
(see Annex III for the breakdown of project cost and financing plan).
Retroactive financing of about US$60,000 is recommended to cover the costs
of the services of experts engaged prior to loan signing for architectural



- 10 -
designs of primary school units and the teacher training institute and the
planning of vocational training. The cost of technical assistance totaling
28 man-years is estimated to average about US$40,000 per man-year (of which
about US$27,000 is estimated to be for salaries, including post adjustment
allowance). These estimates are based on the most recent experience of ILO,
UNESCO and the Government in recruiting technical assistance personnel for
Liberia.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.      Civil works for the teacher training institute (US$300,000),
furniture (US$609,000), and equipment (US$742,000) would be procured on the
basis of international competitive bidding. The renovation of two staff
houses for the ZRTTI staff (US$34,000) and minor works for adapting and air-
conditioning the publications unit (US$50,000) would be undertaken on force
account by the ZRTTI staff and by the Ministry of Public Works, respectively.
Furniture, equipment, vehicles and other items which cannot be grouped in
packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent each or which are not suitable for
international competitive bidding may be procured on the basis of quotations
in accordance with local procedures acceptable to the Bank. Local manufac-
turers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preferential margin of
15 percent of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the applicable
customs duties and import taxes, whichever is lower.
36.       The Government would build the 100 primary school units, valued
at US$1.74 million, using Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere (CARE)
as its executing agent. CARE, a non-profit organization, has successfully
constructed 35 such schools for the Government under an on-going (1974-1976)
program. It would promote local capability for construction and encourage
self-help and private/community initiatives at the village level. This
arrangement, requested by the Government, would ensure continuity between
the on-going primary school construction program implemented under a contract
with CARE and the rural community schools program under the proposed second
project. CARE, whose costs, on the basis of past experience in Liberia, are
normally about 50 percent of those quoted by commercial contractors for
comparable work, has proven itself to be efficient in this type of construc-
tion. It would also train local staff in basic construction skills and in
the management of school building programs.
37.        The proposed Third Window loan is expected to be disbursed during
FYs 1977-1980 (details in Annex III). Disbursements from the loan would
cover: (a) 45 percent of total expenditures for civil works; (b) 100 percent
of foreign expenditures for direct imports and 80 percent of total expendi-
tures for locally procured furniture; (c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
for direct imports and 75 percent of total expenditures for locally procured
equipment; (d) 70 percent of total expenditures for consultants' services;
(e) 80 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance; and (f) 100
percent of foreign expenditures for fellowships.



Project Benefits and Justification
38.        The government of Liberia wishes to reduce the heavy dependence
of its national economy on the performance of the enclave sector. Conse-
quently, its development strategy aims at economic diversification; and
the cornerstone of the diversification objective is integrated rural
development and the deveLopment of human resources.   The proposed second
education project would promote a closer link between the education system
and the country's economLc development objectives. It would assist the
Government in: (a) making basic education accessible to rural children and
adults; (b) increasing the output and improving the quality of trained
teachers to serve in rural schools; and (c) training and giving experience
to a corps of Liberians t:o administer the education sector.
39.        The project would also assist the Government in correcting the
traditional geographical imbalance in the distribution of school facilities:
the primary community schools to be assisted under the project would be
located in north-western Liberia (the counties of Bong, Lofa, Cape Mount,
Grand Bassa, Montserrado and Nimba). It would help improve and strengthen
the Gvoernment's administrative and planning machinery for the achievement

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 617-LBR            Port Development Project:  US$3.6 million
Loan of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
March 31, 1977.
This port project involved dredging the approaches and an area
within the Monrovia port to accommodate bulk ore carriers and tankers;
provision of two tugs and a pilot launch, as well as additional buoying and
lighting of the navigable channels; consultants' services for individual
advisers and feasibility studies for the development of road approaches to
the port. Project execution has been satisfactory. The Bank has agreed to
the Government's request that funds still undisbursed be used to help finance
an overall study of port development needs in Liberia, which was stipulated
in the project. Government signed a contract in May 1974 for the first phase
of port development study, and is now assessing the results of this phase
before undertaking the second phase of the study.
Loan No. 684-LBR            Power Projects:  US$7.7 million Loan of June 4,
1970 (fully disbursed); US$7.6 million Loan of
Loan No. 778-LBR            October 26, 1973; Closing date:  December 31,
1975; and US$1.8 million Loan of August 1, 1975;
Loan No. 1150-LBR           Closing date:  June 30, 1979.
The loans to the Public Utilities Authority (PUA) have helped finance
the expansion of the Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, the installation of two
gas turbines at the Bushrod (Monrovia) plant; procurement and erection of 42
miles of overhead lines in Monrovia and 54 miles in outlying areas; establish-
ment of a new substation and related facilities. There have been cost overruns
mainly due to international currency fluctuations and the purchase of larger
generators than originally anticipated. A supplemental loan of US$2.9 million
was provided in October, 1973 to cover the cost overruns, and project implementa-
tion is proceeding satisfactorily. On July 8, 1975, the Board approved a
technical assistance loan of US$1.8 million for PUA. Project implementation
is underway.

Credit No. 306-LBR          Agriculture Project: US$1.2 million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Closing date: December 31, 1976;
Credit No. 577-LBR          and US$6 million Credit of August 1, 1975;
Closing-date: December 31, 1981.
The first agriculture credit includes feasibility studies and
preparation of detailed investment proposals for integrated rural development
projects; a physical survey and detailed study of the Liberian-owned rubber
industry; a pilot rubber scheme to provide Liberian rubber farmers with credits
to rehabilitate untapped or poorly tapped rubber; improving rice research;
reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and training for Liberians to
prepare investment projects. A second agriculture project was approved in
1975. It includes the following elements: provision of seasonal and develop-
ment credit to assist project farmers develop and improve production of
5,600 hectares of upland rice, 1,900 hectares of swamp rice, 2,800 hectares
of coffee and 2,300 hectares of cocoa; construction of 100 village wfells;
provision of schistosomiasis surveillance unit; construction and operation
of staff and farmer training centers; recruitment and training of Liberians
for extension, cooperative credit and project management; introduction of
an agricultural credit system through new institutional arrangements such as
creation of a special revolving fund and the establishment of a branch of the
Liberian Bank for Development and Investment at the project center in Voinjama.
Loan No. 839-LBR            Development Finance Company:  US$1 million
Loan of June 26, 1972; Closing date:
Loan No. 1055-LBR           December 31, 1976 and US$4 million; Loan of
December 3, 1974; Closing date June 30, 1979.
The first loan contributed to foreign exchange costs of industrial
projects financed by LBD]: in 1972 and 1973. This loan is fully committed.
The second loan would help LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar year 1976.
Credit No. 907-LBR          Highway Project: US$3.0 million Loan of June 13,
1973; Closing date: December 31, 1977;
Loan No. 395-LBR            US$2.6 million Credit of June 13, 1973; Closing
date: December 31, 1977; and US$27.5 million
Loan No. 1156-LBR           Loan of August 28, 1975; Closing date: December 31,
1979.
Implementation of the maintenance program, which started about six
months behind schedule, is progressing slowly. Further delays were caused
by a US$4.0 million cost overrun on the US-financed maintenance equipment,
and a delay in its delivery. USAID has agreed to provide supplementary
financing. Contracts for all engineering studies have been signed, and work
progress is satisfactory. The construction contract for the Monrovia Bypass
has been awarded and work has begun. Implementation of the project being
financed under the last loan is well underway. Contracts have been awarded
for Mesurado Bridge, Totota-Ganta Road, UN Drive and for Supervision Consul-
tancy.

Credit No. 305-LBR          Education Project:  US$7.2 million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Closing date: March 1, 1978
The education credit is helping to finance construction of, and
provide equipment for, two new multilateral high schools in the north and the
east, each offering a wide curriculum in agriculture, mechanics and academic
subjects; construction of and equipment for a new college of agriculture and
forestry; expansion of a rural teacher training institute and construction
of an adjacent demonstration school, technical assistance and fellowships
for manpower and education planning, technical teacher training, secondary
education and project implementation. The implementation of this project has
been slow due to difficulties in selecting suitable architectural consultants,
reaching agreement on designs and following satisfactory bidding procedures
for civil works. The problems have been resolved and implementation is now
proceeding satisfactorily. The first of the construction contracts has been
awarded; and the project is expected to be completed by around March 1978,
about six months behind the original schedule,
