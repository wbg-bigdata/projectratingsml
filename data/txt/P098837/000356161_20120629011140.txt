SUDAN - NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
                      (NETREP – P098837)

                                RESTRUCTURING PAPER




  A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed changes involve: (a) an extension of the project closing to complete the
on-going road project which is stalled due to insecurity situation in the Blue Nile State; (b)
reallocation within and among components to: (i) avail funds to institutional development to
continue with the capacity building activities; (ii) provide additional funding to supervision
services to cover the increased cost of supervision, during the extended period of roads
contracts execution; and (iii) allocate the balance of the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Sudan
National Secretariat (MDTF-NS) allocation for the first section of the Damazin-Kurmuk road
to the second section of the Damazin- Kurmuk road contract to cover additional financing
requirements due to the insecurity, increase in quantities of existing bill items and escalation
of prices; (c) drop activities that would not be implemented under the National Emergency
Transport Rehabilitation Project (NETREP); and (d) revision of targets to reflect the changes.
The MDTF-NS Grant closing date is proposed to be extended to June 30, 2013, to allow the
completion of ongoing contracts.

2.      NETREP was approved by the Oversight Committee (OC) on August 28, 2006, and
became effective on January 29, 2007. The original cost estimate for phase 1 of the project
was US$140.36 million and funded in the proportion of US$43.50 million from MDTF-NS
grant and US$96.86 million from the Government of National Unity (GONU). An Additional
Financing (AF) in the amount of US$43.75 million was made available to the project in 2009,
raising the MDTF-NS contribution to US$87.25. The purpose of the AF was mainly to
increase the allocations for the road improvement component to improve accessibility on the
entire length of Kadugli – Kaouda Road and Section 2 of Damazin – Kurmuk Road.
However, due to the taking over of the Kadugli-Kaouda road by the State Administration of
South Kordofan, which was construed as mis-procurement US$19.75 million was cancelled,
reducing the MDTF-NS contribution to US$67.5 million.

3.      NETREP was prepared and implemented in post-conflict environment, but it has
overcome the inherent challenges of lack of implementation capacity, meeting the Bank’s
fiduciary and safeguard requirements and started delivering results, through: (a) full
commitment of the Implementing Entities; (b) strong support of the Bank’s project
management team to procurement and contract management tasks; (c) technical assistance;
and (iv) applying risk mitigation measures concurrent to project implementation. In the latest
ISR, archived on March 11, 2012, the project development objective (PDO) and
implementation progress are rated “moderately satisfactory?, mainly due to the suspension of
the contracts on Damazin – Kurmuk road, because of conflict and insecurity in the project
implementation area, which will be addressed by the measures proposed under the
repackaging section (para 12). The ISR rating for safeguards, project management,
procurement, and counterpart funding are moderately satisfactory, due to delays in the
preparation of Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, procurement, and release of
counterpart funding. Except for the latter, the issues have been overcome. The Client, the
Project Implementing Entities and the Program Management Teams (PMT) are complying
                                               1
with key covenants specified in the Grant Agreement. The Project Implementing Entities
have established an acceptable accounting and reporting system for the project that will also
be applied to the restructured project. Timely release of counter-part funding to the ongoing
road contracts is a challenge re-emerging from time to time. The government has reconfirmed
its commitment to meet its obligation, and the Project Team and the Country Management
Unit have to follow up this covenant regularly for the remaining life time of the project.

4.     There are no unresolved fiduciary, environmental, social or other safeguard issues.
The audit for the year ended December 31, 2011 is in progress. The Interim Financial Report
(IFR) for the quarter ended March 30, 2012 did not indicate any significant financial
management issue. Financial management, procurement arrangement, and institutional roles
and responsibilities remain unchanged. There are no changes to the PDO, except the
adjustment of the outcome targets on reduction in travel time, beneficiary population, and
increase in traffic volume, due to the completion of the upgrading of part of the Damazin –
Kurmuk road.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

5.       The project has three components, namely: component 1 – Rehabilitation of Critical
Rail Infrastructure and Services, component 2 - Institutional Strengthening and Improvement
to River Transport Services, and component 3- Road Improvement in the Three Areas.
Project implementation progress is at a very advanced stage. The Babanusa – Wau rail line
rehabilitation project was completed in March 2010 and rail transport services have resumed
after 25 years of disruption. The upgrading of Kadugli – Kouda Road Lot B (30 km) and
Gadamai – Hamashkoraib Road (81.5 km) has been completed. The engineering design of
945 km of national and rural roads has been completed. The feeder roads study will be
completed by the end of June 2012. The studies on the private sector participation (PSP) in
rail transport, Port Sudan trade facilitation, and Inland River Navigation Diagnostics, as well
as the preparation of the National Transport Master Plan (NTMP) have delivered sound
sector development policies and strategies, and implementation is in progress.

6.      However, the contracts for the Damazin – Kurmuk road (Sections 1 and 2) have been
suspended since September 2011 due to conflict and insecurity in the project area (Blue Nile
State). The government and the contractors are monitoring the situation and indications are
that the situation has normalized and would allow the contractors to resume works. The two
contractors with representatives of the Client jointly visited the project site in March 2012 to
assess the damages and finalize claims for compensation. The visit confirmed the contractors’
willingness to go back to work as they have noticed improvement in security in the project
area. However, remobilization and recommencement of works will follow fulfillment of
certain conditions put forward by the contractors e.g. payment of outstanding counterpart
funds for Section 1 and compensation of damaged contractors’ properties.

7.      Studies under the institutional development component have been completed.
Currently Technical Assistance services in support of the Planning Directorate and the
Environmental and Social management Unit (ESMU) are in progress. In addition, the
Ministry of Transport, Roads and Bridges (MTRB) is coordinating the implementation of key
recommendations of the studies carried out under the support of the MDTF-NS, including: (a)
separating/splitting rail infrastructure management responsibilities from rail transport
operation; (b) shortening the duration for clearance of goods at Port Sudan; and (c) promoting
the establishment of an independent Road Fund.

                                               2
  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

8.       The Project Development Objectives remain unchanged which is “to facilitate the
country's economic and social recovery through improved physical access to goods, markets,
and administrative and social services?. The outcome targets for reduction in travel time,
beneficiary population, and increase in traffic volume, will be reduced to reflect the impact of
the changes in the Damazin – Kurmuk road. The section along the Damazin – Kurmuk road
to be fully upgraded by the end of the proposed grant closing date of June 2013 will reduce
from 92 km to 45 km. For example, the baseline and target values for travel time reduction
will change from the original - from 11.6 hours per trip to 1.3 hours to, from 11.6 hours to 2
hours. Also, the number of the beneficiary population will reduce from 301,000 to 287,500.
The expected increase in traffic volume on Damazin –Kurmuk road from 40 trucks per day to
110 trucks per day will not be realized until the entire section will be upgraded. Nonetheless,
the original objective of creating all season access between Damazin-and Kurmuk through
spot improvement has been achieved, as the contractors have reconditioned the existing 92
km embankment, and the Blue Nile State Government has improved the remaining section up
to Kurmuk. As an outcome the entire road is passable during the rainy season. Further, the
upgrading of the remaining part of Section 1 of the Damazin-Kurmuk road is expected to be
fully financed by the government.

9.      The Results Framework (RF) is updated and revised as part of this restructuring to
reflect the changes and reflect standard/commonly used indicator descriptions and Core
Indicators.

10.    The Client, based on the request from the implementing institutions, has proposed the
following changes:

11.     Repackaging the Damazin – Kurmuk road and trading off funds between the two
sections of the road as proposed by the Ministry of Finance and National; Economy
(MoFNE): To complete section 2 of Damazin – Kurmuk road, which was suspended due to
the conflict and insecurity in the Blue Nile State and compensate the contractor for damages
caused due to the conflict MoFNE, by a letter dated April 23, 2012, has proposed swapping
the provision for compensation (claims settlement) for section 2 of the Damazin – Kurmuk
road with the MDTF-NS allocation for the gravel works on section 1 of the Damazin –
Kurmuk road. The proposal is to apply US$6.59 million earmarked by the MDTF-NS for
section 1, for the compensation of the damage on section 2, while GOS takes over the
responsibility for fully financing the outstanding works for section 1, including the
completion of the road up to sub-base level. Subsequently, section 1 of the Damazin-Kurmuk
road has to be dropped from NETREP, and be taken up by GOS, as there will be no sufficient
funding under the MDTF-NS to cover the gravelling work of section 1 and raise the
additional resources required to complete section 2.       Any additional compensation for
section 2 will be borne by GOS. Further, this requires the Bank to verify eligibility of such
payment. In addition, the Government has to confirm that the area would be safe to carry out
construction activity and will ensure the provision of adequate security coverage around the
project site.

12.    Due to the separation of South Sudan, the ferry boat that was to be provided for Sobat
River crossing near Malakal in Southern Sudan will be dropped from NETREP as requested

                                               3
    by the Client. The amount of US$240,000 allocated for this activity will be reallocated to
    other activities.

    13.   Project Costs: The Financing Arrangement is proposed to be amended to reflect the
    changes, as presented in Table 1.

    14.    As a result of the proposed changes, the contribution from MDTF-NS will reduce
    from US$67.5 million to US$64.7 million. Likewise, the contribution from GOS, in a form of
    counterpart funding, will reduce from US$68.71 million to US$65.82 million, as the
    counterpart payments for the services concluded at a lower price than budgeted and activities
    dropped from NETREP will not be required. However, GOS has to provide out of NETREP,
    additional funds to complete the section 1 of the Demazin - Kurmuk road.



    Reallocations:

    15.           The proposed reallocations, by disbursement category, include:

             a.      Category 9: An increase of US$190,000 for project coordination and
                     implementation support and Technical Assistance to MTRB.

             b.      Category 10; An increase of US$310,000 to cover the additional funds required to
                     pay for works executed before repackaging of section one of the Damazin-
                     Kurmuk road.
