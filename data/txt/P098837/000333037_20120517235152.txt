                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER

SUMMARY
1.      The proposed changes involve: (i) reallocation within and among components to: (a)
avail funds to institutional development to continue with the capacity building activities; (b)
provide additional funding to supervision services to cover the increased cost of supervision,
during the extended period of roads contracts execution; and (c) utilize the savings from low
bid amounts to augment t he financial pr ovision t o t he ongoing r oad c ontracts t o cover
additional financing (AF) requirements due to increase in quantities of existing bill items; (ii)
dropping activities that would not be implemented under the National Emergency Transport
Rehabilitation Project (NETREP); and (iii) reflecting in project documents the cancellation of
the allocation for Lots A, C, D and E of Kadugli – Kaouda Road due to mis-procurement, and
(iv) extension of the Grant closing date by 12 m onths, from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012,
to allow the completion of ongoing contracts.

2.      Further, t o improve i mplementation performance and e nsure t he a chievement o f the
Project D evelopment O bjectives ( PDO), i t i s proposed to carry out t he construction o f
Section 1 of the Damazin – Kurmuk road to an all-weather gravel road (up to sub-base level)
with full financing from the Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)
   3.
4.      . The outstanding base course and asphalt concrete works would be executed under a
separate arrangement, o ut of NETREP, fully financed by Government of N ational U nity
(GONU), as a complementary project.

Background

5.      NETREP was approved by the Oversight Committee (OC) on August 28, 2006, and
became effective on January 29, 2007. The original cost estimate for phase 1 of the project
was U S$140.36 million and f unded i n the pr oportion of US$43.50 million f rom MDTF-N
and US$96.86 million from the GONU. The project development objective of NETREP is to
improve physical a ccess t o g oods, markets, and administrative and social services by
rehabilitating c ritical rail i nfrastructure a nd services, a nd improving river transport services
and roads. The project focuses on key trade routes linking the North and the South with Port
Sudan, and a ddressing the i solation of c ommunities in the three a reas affected by the civil
war, a major impediment to recovery and development.

6.      An AF in the amount of US$43.75 million was made available to the project in 2009.
The purpose of the a dditional financing was mainly t o increase the allocations f or the road
improvement c omponent to improve accessibility on the entire length of Kadugli – K aouda
Road and Section 2 o f Damazin – Kurmuk Road. At the same time, as part of AF process,
the Grant closing date of NETREP was extended to June 30, 2011. The original Grant closing
date w as D ecember 30 , 2009. T he A F pr ocess ha d a r estructuring e lement, know n a s t he
second restructuring, which dealt with Grant closing date extension and reallocation. The first
restructuring w as c onducted i n 2008 to r eallocate funds a mong components a nd drop out
                                                 1
some r iver t ransport r elated activities, following the pr ivatization of t he R iver T ransport
Corporation ( RTC). S ubsequently, t he Ministry of Transport, Roads a nd Bridges took over
the responsibility of implementation of river transport related activities from RTC.

7.      NETREP was pr epared and i mplemented i n post-conflict e nvironment, but it h as
overcome the i nherent c hallenges of lack o f implementation capacity, meeting t he B ank’s
fiduciary and safeguard r equirements a nd s tarted d elivering r esults, t hrough: ( i) f ull
commitment o f the I mplementing Entities; ( ii) s trong s upport of t he B ank’s pr oject
management team to procurement and contract management tasks; (iii) technical assistance;
and (iv) a pplying risk mitigation measures concurrent to project implementation. C urrently,
project pr ogress i s pi cking-up a nd t he r ating f or i mplementation pr ogress i s m oderately
satisfactory while the rating f or achieving p roject d evelopment objective ( PDO) i s
satisfactory. The Recipient, the Project Implementing Entities and the Program Management
Teams (PMT) a re c omplying w ith ke y covenants specified i n t he G rant A greement. T he
Project I mplementing E ntities have e stablished a n acceptable accounting and r eporting
system for the project that will also be applied to the restructured project. Timely release of
counter-part f unding t o the ong oing r oad contracts i s a challenge re-emerging f rom t ime to
time. The government has reconfirmed its commitment to meet its obligation, and the Project
Team and t he C ountry Management U nit have t o f ollow-up this c ovenant r egularly for t he
remaining life time of the project.

8.       There are no unresolved fiduciary, environmental, social or other safeguard issues and
project implementation is m oderately satisfactory. T here a re no c hanges to t he PDO or the
project out come indicators. F inancial management, procurement arrangements, and
institutional roles and responsibilities remain unchanged. The resettlement of businesses a t
two villages a long t he Damazin-Kurmuk r oad is c ompleted and t here i s no unr esolved
safeguard issue.


PROJECT STATUS
9.       The Babanusa-Wau rail line rehabilitation project was completed in March 2010 and
rail transport services have resumed after 25 years of disruption. The engineering design for
the Abu Gebeieha – T alodi – K adugli r oad ( 310 km) is c ompleted and design services,
including t he E nvironment a nd s ocial I mpact A ssessment ( ESIA) and t he associated
safeguards instruments for 685 km of national and rural roads are expected to be completed
before J une 30 , 2011 . T he pr ogress of t he Gadamai- Hamashkoraib r oad ha s g ained
momentum a nd the overall pr ogress ha s r eached more than 50 p ercent. NHA and t he
contractor are assuming that this contract would be completed in June 2011. The contractor
for the Kadugli-Kaouda (Lot B) had substantially completed the works by end of December
2010. The construction works on Section 2 of the D amazin - Kurmuk road a re i n progress
and about 35 percent of the works were completed and the contract is expected to reach to a
substantial completion stage by June/July 2011.

10.     However, the progress on Section 1 of the Damazin – Kurmuk road is slow. The road
construction contractors a re w orking under serious f inancial constraint, m ainly due t o
persistent d elays i n t he r elease of the counterpart por tion o f p ayments f or works executed.
These di fficulties are c ompounded by delayed payments f or ot her government contracts in
hand, not financed und er MDTF t hat are also a ffecting t he liquidity of t he contractors. I n
order to minimize further delays the implementing agency (NHA) has to develop, as a matter

                                                2
of urgency, a strategy for the completion of Section 1 of the Damazin –Kurmuk road whose
contract completion time elapsed in September 2010.

11.     All t he above r oad projects have defects liability pe riods of one y ear after t heir
substantial completion da tes. T his means that their f inal completion and handover to t he
client will be towards June 2012, with the exception of Kadugli – Kaouda (Lot B) road which
will come to the end of its defects liability period by the end of 2011.

12.     Institutional de velopment a ctivities a re progressing well. T he studies on P rivate
Sector P articipation (PSP) i n r ail transport, Port Sudan Trade F acilitation a nd I nland River
Navigation D iagnostics, as w ell as the preparation of the National Transport Master P lan
(NTMP) were completed and the studies have delivered sound reform principles and sector
development strategies. The Taskforce, e stablished by the f ormer M inistry of T ransport,
Roads a nd Bridges ( MTRB) i s pl aying i ts c oordination r ole. Currently, t he t askforce i s
focusing on five priorities: (i) Promoting the establishment of rail transport community; (ii)
Separating/splitting rail i nfrastructure m anagement r esponsibilities from r ail t ransport
operation; (iii) Shortening the duration for clearance of goods at Port Sudan; (iv) Promoting
the establishment of an independent Road Fund; and (v) Adoption of the NTMP.


PROPOSED CHANGES
13.    The PDOs and outcomes remain unchanged.

14.    The R ecipient, ba sed on t he request f orm the implementing institutions, ha ve
proposed the following changes:

15.      Reallocation within component and among components of NETREP: A bout
US$150,000, from C omponent 3 (Road I mprovement) is pr oposed t o be r eallocated to the
Institutional D evelopment ( Component 2) . T his a mount c orresponds t o a por tion of t he
unutilized pr ovision f or de-mining of US$780,000. T he r eallocated funds w ill be us ed to
provide m uch ne eded f inancing t o the strengthening of the P lanning Directorate a nd t he
Environment and Social Management Unit (ESMU) of the Ministry of Transport (MOT). Part
of the r eallocated m oney will be us ed t o s upplement t he c osts o f the P roject Coordination
over the extension period. The Coordination Unit will also continue to provide support to the
Taskforce overseeing the implementation of sectoral policy reforms initiated under NETREP.
The balance of the provision for de-mining, about US$630, 000 is suggested to augment the
reallocations needed to cover increases of supervision services fees for the road contracts as
well a s some costs on the w orks c ontracts, due to une xpected i ncreased quantities i n some
items of civil works. B alance from the road improvement G rant categories that may not be
utilized under the current contracts - due to bids received being lower than the estimated cost
amount - will be applied to their respective contracts to cover costs of additional works. The
reallocations details are presented in Annex 2.

16.    Focusing the engagement of NETREP on activities that would help to achieve the
Project Development Objective (PDO): Repackaging the civil works contract of Section one
of the Damazin –Kurmuk road: The progress on Section one of Damazin – Kurmuk Road is
slow as mentioned above a nd there is a concern that by the proposed Grant closing date of
June 30, 2012 the project may not be able to provide all weather access to the project target
population. To address this challenge the Recipient is intending to focus the engagement of

                                                3
NETREP o n activities t hat w ould help t o a chieve the pr oject d evelopment ob jective, “to
facilitate t he country's e conomic a nd s ocial recovery through i mproved physical a ccess to
goods, m arkets, and a dministrative a nd social services?. In l ine with this i t is proposed to
complete t he c onstruction of S ection one of the D amazin –Kurmuk road to a n a ll-weather
gravel road (up t o sub-base level - s ub-base i nclusive) under the c urrent c ontract with one
hundred percent financing from the MDTF.

17.     The scope of works would be reduced through a variation to the current contract by
omitting the base and asphalt wearing course. O n the other hand, the outstanding base a nd
asphalt wearing c ourse w ould be packaged in a nother contract and i mplemented unde r a
separate arrangement out of NETREP, with one hundred 100 percent financing from GONU,
as a complementary project, a s part of t he c ountry’s r oads network development program.
This approach in the short term (6 to 12 months) will ensure the achievement of the objective
of providing all-weather access to the population. I n the long run (in about two years time)
GONU is committed to deliver an asphalt paved road by completing the remaining activities.
The latter would also help to ease the pressure of funding requirement from the government
for this specific r oad. A ccordingly, i t is proposed to a mend t he G rant A greement for
NETREP to reflect the one hundred percent financing of the road to all-weather gravel road
(up t o sub ba se level) f rom MDTF. C oncurrently, t he project financing a rrangement i s
proposed to be m odified t o r eflect the changes of executing the ba se a nd asphalt wearing
course und er a s eparate arrangement by GONU, a nd s ubsequently the a mount for the
execution of the base and asphalt wearing course, equivalent to US$12.6 million is reduced
from GONU’s contribution for NETREP.

18.      The contractor may request for compensation for the omission of significant portion
of the works ( base and asphalt w earing c ourse) from t he c urrent c ontract as a variation.
Further, the contractor undertaking the contract financed by MDTF may delay works due to
non-payment on the GONU financed contract. To mitigate the former risk, the Implementing
Entity, N ational H ighways Authority ( NHA) has c onfirmed to t he B ank that a separate
contract for the base and asphalt wearing course will be signed concurrent to the issuance of
the variation, and this ensures that the contractor will have two contracts covering all works.
In a ddition, N HA will submit t o t he Bank a variation prepared i n l ine w ith the proposed
arrangement f or the works up t o s ub-base level (omitting ba se and asphalt w earing course)
and initialed by both NHA and the contractor confirming the acceptance of the variation by
the contractor. To mitigate the latter risk, the contract financed by GONU (base and asphalt
wearing course) is taken out of NETREP and the MDTF financed projects will run separately
and t here will be no ground f or the c ontractors to l ink non-payment by G ONU t o pr ojects
under N ETREP. I t is w orth t o not e that the proposed r epackaging and fully f inancing the
works up to sub-base level will be an incentive to the contractor, in terms of getting paid on
time, and will help to complete the works up to sub-base level in a short period of time. The
remaining work to have a completed road up to sub base/ gravel level is limited and could be
completed within shorter time and the risk of slippage beyond June 30, 2012 is low, and thus
the likelihood of achieving the PDO, through provision of all-weather gravel road access, is
high.

19.    The moderately satisfactory rating of pr ocurement i n t he I SR a rchived in J anuary
2011 is mainly related to the absence of decision by the Recipient on t he way forward with
Section one of the Damazin - Kurmuk road contract whose contract completion period was
September 2010. A s p art of this r estructuring, the Recipient ha s c ome t o t he solution
described a bove. T he v ariation f or reduced scope to the c urrent contract and a separate

                                               4
contract f or t he ba se a nd a sphalt w earing c ourse a re und er pr eparation and e xpected to be
signed s hortly. T his action w ould r esolve t he pr ocurement and contract m anagement
challenges the project is currently facing.

20.     Reflect in the project documents the activities that were dropped from NETREP: Due
to the presence of mines along the alignment, the design of Kadugli – Higlieg road (130 km)
has to be dropped. In addition, because of mis-procurement related to the taking over of the
Sections A, C, D, and E of Kadugli – Kaouda Road (94.km) by the State of South Kordofan
while the tender process by t he NHA was in progress, the sections have been dropped from
NETREP. However, these sections are under construction by the State Administration and the
beneficiaries w ill have access as e nvisaged during pr eparation of N ETREP, thus, still
contributing towards achievement of the intended project development objectives. F urther,
NHA ha s i ndicated t hat i t i s c onsidering the opt ion of preparing bi dding doc uments for
performance based m aintenance c ontracting, f or the roads t o b e improved unde r N ETREP,
from i ts ow n f inancing s ources, upon completion of the c onstruction c ontracts. T he Bank
may provide technical support to NHA, during preparation of TORs and bidding documents,
as requested.

   Financing

21.    Project Costs: The project cost, in t he amount of US$19.75 million, h as be en
cancelled due to declaration of mis-procurement of Lots A, C, D and E of Kadugli – Kaouda
Road.. These Sections were taken over by the State Government of South Kordofan while at
procurement stage by the Implementing Entity.

22.     The financing source for Section one of the Damazin - Kurmuk road is proposed to be
modified. Accordingly, MDTF i s proposed t o fully finance t he c ost up t o s ub-base l evel
(inclusive) while GONU will be fully financing the remaining works (base course and asphalt
wearing course), under separate arrangements.

23.     GONU will be financing the base and asphalt wearing course, amounting to US$12.6
million separately, out of NETREP.

24.     Due t o completion of some c ontracts unde r t he c ontracted a mounts and bi ds l ower
than estimated costs the contribution of GONU has reduced by US$690,000.

25.    The c hanges i ndicated in 23 and 24 above will reduce t he G ONU’s to US$68.71
million, making the overall share of GONU to NETREP 50.4 percent.

26.    The Financing Arrangement is pr oposed t o b e amended to r eflect the c hanges, a s
presented in Table 1.
