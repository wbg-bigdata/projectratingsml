APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Rapid urbanization and industrialization, deficient sewer systems
and uncontrolled discharges of industrial wastewaters have resulted in severe
pollution of Greece's coastal waters and shown the need for upgrading the
country's sewerage sector policies. The Government has selected the cities of
Salonica and Volos for implementing new sectoral policies because their sewer
systems are especially deficient and their different degrees of industrializa-
tion provide a good range for the study of industrial wastewater management.
ii.       Water and sewerage services have hitherto been mainly the respons-
ibility of municipal authorities. The trend has been towards the establish-
ment of semi-autonomous authorities to run these services, under the general
supervision of the Ministry of Public Works or the Ministry of Interior.
Where such organizations have already been established, considerable stream-
lining of their administrative arrangements is desirable.
iii.      Apart from the physical construction of sewerage systems in
Salonica and Volos, the major goal of the project is to improve the planning
and design of sewerage projects and to develop local expertise in water pollu-
tion control procedures and industrial wastewater management. The project is
also intended to initiate and develop sectoral reforms in accounting and fi-
nancial administration.
iv.       The project will comprise the construction of interceptors, treat-
ment and disposal facilities for Salonica; construction of sewer networks,
interceptors, pre-treatment and an ocean outfall in Volos; industrial waste-
water surveys; oceanographic studies; design of additional treatment facili-
ties in Salonica; accounting, financial control and tariff studies; and
training.
v.        Project costs are estimated to total US$113 million with the esti-
mated foreign exchange component of US$36 million to be covered by the pro-
posed Bank loan. The major part of the loan would be on-lent to separate
project entities, on Bank terms, towards physical construction costs. The
Government would retain a small portion towards the cost of studies and
training. Pending the establishment of adequate technical and administra-
tive capability in the project authorities, the supervision of construction
would be undertaken, on their behalf, by the Ministry of Public Works.
vi.       All procurement would be in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Advance contracting might be necessary for oceanographic studies and final
project design. This may result in the Bank being asked to finance retro-
actively up to US$100,000 of approved contract expenditures. It may be
appropriate for certain works, up to a maximum of US$1.0 million, to be
carried out by the staff of the two project entities.



- ii -
vii.      The project is technically and economically sound.  The construction
components are the least-cost solution for meeting the sewerage needs of each
city and will make significant contributions to the public health and environ-
ment in and around these towns. The studies will contribute towards the es-
tablishment of more rational management of the sector.
viii.     Sewerage charges will have to be significantly increased in each
city to permit full long-term cost recovery of the provision and operation of
the system, and to provide a reasonable proportion of funds for expansion.
ix.       Agreement having been reached on the various matters referred to in
the report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$36 million to the
Government of Greece for a period of 15 years, including a 3-year grace
period, with on-lending of portions of the loan to the Salonica Sewerage
Authority and the Volos Water and Sewerage Organization, as outlined in the
report.



APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Greece has requested a Bank loan to help finance
the first construction stages of the Salonica and Volos sewerage programs.
The Government intends these projects to serve as pilots for institutional
development of regional water and sewer authorities as well as vehicles for
improving national expertise in industrial wastewater management, operation
of wastewater treatment facilities and water pollution control. The proposed
construction, which, with related studies, is estimated to cost US$113 million,
constitutes the first stage of works to be constructed in accordance with the
sewer master plans for both cities.
1.02      Engineering feasibility studies for Salonica were prepared by OTME
Hydraulic Projects Ltd. (Greece) and D. Balfour and Sons (England) and, for
Volos, by Alex G. Macheras S.A. (Greece) and Balasha-Jalon (Israel). Finan-
cial and institutional studies were conducted by the Hellenic Industrial
Development Bank (ETVA) with the assistance of Arthur Andersen and Company.
Oceanographic studies were conducted by the Institute of Oceanographic and
Fishing Research (IOKAE) and industrial wastewater surveys by ETVA.
1.03      During 1975, various project preparation missions composed of
Messrs. Thys, Jones, Cuellar and Gunnerson (consultant) reviewed the work
being conducted by IOKAE, ETVA and the consultants and agreed on the project
scope and its basic design criteria.
1.04      A mission composed of Messrs. Jones and Cuellar appraised the
project in February-March 1976. This report is based on the consultants'
reports and the mission's findings.
II. THE SEWERAGE SECTOR
A.   Existing Sewer Systems
2.01      The main Greek cities are located on the coast and have tradi-
tionally discharged their wastewaters into the sea. Their sewer systems
usually consist of laterals and multiple trunk mains discharging at the
shore into surface waters. Only parts of Athens and Salonica have in-
tegrated sewer networks discharging through submarine outfalls. Inland
communities have depended mainly on septic tanks and percolation pits and
only recently have started construction of sewer systems. These systems
lack treatment facilities and usually discharge into the nearest water
body. Even though the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) now requires sep-
arate sanitary sewers in all new projects, most of the existing systems
are still of the combined (waste and storm waters) type.



- 2-
B.   Urbanization and Industrialization
2.02      During the last census decade (1961-1971), Greece registered a high
tempo of urbanization, of 4% per year, which was due mainly to the accelerated
industrialization of the country. Projections based on this demographic
trend indicate that urban population, which in 1971 constituted 53% of the
total population, would reach 76% by 1996.
2.03      To date, the internal migration has been absorbed almost exclusively
by Athens and Salonica, which together now contain about 38% of the country's
population. To improve the spatial distribution of migration, the Government
is advancing regional development programs and encouraging growth of smaller
cities such as Volos by improving their public services and promoting their
industrialization.
C.   Pollution
2.04      The intensive urban growth and uncontrolled discharge of industrial
wastewaters have caused severe pollution of rivers and coastal waters. Con-
struction of poorly planned submarine outfalls in Athens and Salonica and
the establishment of arbitrary industrial effluent standards have failed to
abate the growing pollution and have shown the need for development of local
expertise in environmental engineering.
2.05      Greece expects to shortly join the European Common Market and will
therefore have to impose upon its industries environmental protection stand-
ards, comparable to those of other member countries. The Government will
also have to step up its efforts on water pollution control in accordance with
the spirit of the recently signed Barcelona Agreement for pollution abatement
in the Mediterranean and also to prevent further damage to its important
tourism and fishing industries.
D.   Sector Organization
2.06      Traditionally the water supply and sewer systems have been operated
by the municipalities. However, urban development across municipal bound-
aries has already led, in Athens and Salonica, to the creation of regional
water and sewerage authorities responsible to the central government and is
bringing regionalization in other urban areas. In Athens and Salonica, the
Government opted for separate water supply and sewerage authorities but its
present thinking favors the eventual merging of regional water supply and
sewerage under single authorities for each urban area.
2.07      Design and construction of new water supply and sewer systems and
important expansions or upgrading of existing systems have been usually fi-
nanced by central government grants and loans and constructed by private con-
tractors under the direction of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). Smaller
constructions have been usually financed through low interest loans provided
by the provincial governments and conducted by the municipalities through
private contractors or force account.



- 3 -
2.08      Design and construction of sewerage projects are conducted by pri-
vate consultants and contractors under the supervision of the MPW and are
governed by generally out-dated design standards and construction specifica-
tions. Staged sewer construction is rarely practised so that overdesign is
common. Construction is usually good and local contracting capacity is
adequate but present specifications need considerable updating to incorporate
new materials, equipment and construction processes. The MPW intends to use
the experience gained from the Salonica and Volos sewerage projects to update
the existing standards and specifications.
E.   Reorganization of the Sector
2.09      The Government is aware of the shortcomings of its institutions in
the sewerage field and it has requested assistance not only from the Bank but
also from the UNDP and WHO. WHO has already conducted a preliminary study of
the institutional aspects of the establishment of a national environmental
protection agency. UNDP offered financial assistance for the feasibility
studies of the Athens sewerage system and WHO has been assisting the MPW in
selecting consultants for this work.
2.10      From the preparation of the Salonica and Volos sewerage projects
and from the studies conducted by UNDP/WHO, the following proposals have
emerged for improving the organization of the sewerage sector:
(a) creation of a Wastewater Department within the MPW
to serve as an advisory and regulatory agency for
the sector;
(b) creation of a Project Appraisal Department within
the MPW to review the technical, economic and finan-
cial feasibility of water supply and sewerage projects;
(c) creation of semi-autonomous water supply and sewerage
authorities with responsibility for design, construction
and operation of their systems;
(d) financing of new water supply and sewerage projects by
the central or provincial governments through commercial
type loans together with the introduction of cost-related
tariff policies; and
(e) strengthening of the capabilities of the Institute of
Oceanographic and Fishing Research (IOKAE) for surveying
and monitoring fresh and ocean waters.
III. THE PROJECT AREAS
A.   General
3.01      Detailed descriptions of the project areas and of the existing water
supply and sewerage systems of Salonica and Volos are given in Annexes 1 and 2.



-4-
B.   Greater Salonica
3.02      Greater Salonica is located in northern Greece at the head of the
Thermaikos Gulf and is the second largest population and industrial center of
the country. The metropolitan area extends for about 60 km along the shores
of Salonica Bay, covering an area of about 24,800 ha and including six munici-
palities and 22 townships. Its present population is estimated at 690,000.
3.03      Three industrial zones are located north of the City and a fourth
one is under development on the eastern bank of the Axios River. Today
these industrial zones cover an area of about 1,800 ha, provide employment
for about 70,000 people and house 240 industries.
3.04      During the last census decade (1961-1971) Salonica became the
fastest growing of the Greek cities with an average growth of 3.8% per year.
This accelerated growth is largely due to its privileged geographical position
as the gateway of the Balkans and Central Europe to the Mediterranean. A pro-
posed expansion of Salonica's port facilities and ongoing improvements of the
road network connecting northern Greece with Central Europe should maintain
its importance as an international port.
C.   Greater Salonica Water Supply System
3.05      The Salonica Water Authority (SWA) supplies water to almost the
entire urban area. It operates a 750 km distribution system and six well-
fields located within the metropolitan area. Well construction has never
kept up with the urban growth and Salonica has suffered chronic water short-
ages. As a result, the City has also a large number of privately owned wells.
3.06      Including consumption from privately owned wells, domestic water
consumption during 1974 was estimated at 23.7 million m3 and industrial
consumption at 18.6 million m3. The SWA estimated its total water sales in
1974 at 34.5 million m3 and the population connected to its system at 612,000.
Water production by the SWA was estimated at 47.5 million m3.
3.07      Two new well fields, with an expected combined yield of 265,000
m3/day, are being completed and should provide sufficient water to serve
the expected population and industrial growth up to 1995.
D.   Greater Salonica Sewer System
3.08      Since January 1, 1976 the sewer system has been operated by the
recently created Salonica Sewer Authority (SSA). The system has a length
of about 250 km, partially covers six municipalities and 13 townships and
serves a population estimated at 463,000. The remaining population is
served by an estimated 40,000 septic tanks.



3.09      The downtown area of the City was sewered during the 1930's with
a combined network discharging into the inner Salonica Bay through a sub-
marine outfall. This system has been gradually extended to the north and
northeastern sector of the City causing heavy overloading of the outfall.
The south-eastern part of the City which constitutes its higher-cost resi-
dential zone extends along the coast and its numerous apartment buildings
discharge directly into the sea. The lower cost residential areas occupy
the north-western part of the City, are far away from the ocean and lack
a defined sewer system.
3.10      Two of the industrial zones discharge part of their liquid wastes
into the municipal sewers and the remainder into the Dendropotamos River.
The third zone (Esso) has some pre-treatment facilities and a separate sewer
to the sea.
3.11      The pollution of Salonica Bay has been minimized by the excellent
dispersion resulting from the existing disposal pattern of multiple discharges
into surface waters. However, this type of disposal favors the blooming of
algae which have washed upon the shore where they decompose, producing foul
smells which envelop the City during part of the summer.
3.12      Because of frequent fish killings and high bacterial contamination
of the coastal waters, the City has closed the beaches and forbidden fishing
in the inner Salonica Bay.
E.   Greater Volos
3.13      Greater Volos is located in Central Greece on the northern shore of
Pagasitikos Gulf and ranks fourth in population among Greek cities. The
metropolitan area covers two principal municipalities, several smaller town-
ships and an Industrial Estate with a presently combined built-up area of
about 1,600 ha. Present populations are estimated at 82,600 for the City and
at 97,300 for the entire metropolitan area, excluding the considerable numbers
of tourists which visit Volos during the summer.
3.14      An Industrial Estate developed by ETVA as part of the regional de-
velopment effort, houses today 19 industries. Within the City, there are also
57 smaller industries.
F.   Greater Volos Water Supply System
3.15      An important aquifer underlies the City; lesser aquifers underlie
adjacent areas and numerous springs flow on the slopes of Mount Pilion so that
the metropolitan population has always had an abundant water supply.
3.16      The metropolitan area is served by two main systems operated by
the municipalities of Volos and Nea Ionea plus a new system built by the
Industrial Estate and some minor systems operated by the townships. The
main sources of water are the underground aquifer.



3.17      During 1974, these systems pumped a combined total of 4.3 million
m3 and sold a metered total of 3.2 million m3. It is estimated that an
additional 0.6 million m3 were pumped from privately-owned wells.
3.18      There is concern in Volos that the City aquifer is being contami-
nated by sea water intrusion and by seepage from the numerous septic tanks.
Because of this fear, the City is completing construction of Kaliakouda Spring
aqueduct and is advancing plans to use other springs further away from the
City. With the addition of the Kaliakouda aqueduct, the City will have an
abundant water supply, so agreement has been reached to delay construction of
major additional new water sources until the extent of the aquifer's contamina-
tion can be established by adequate monitoring.
G.   Greater Volos Sewer System
3.19      Within the City only about 110 ha of the coastal area, housing a
population of about 8,400 are presently sewered, through a system composed
of about 15 km of sewers. The rest of the City and all the adjacent villages
and townships are served by septic tanks.
3.20      The area already developed of the Industrial Estate (160 ha) is
served by a recently constructed sewer network discharging into the Xerias
Creek, which flows into the Volos Bay.
3.21      There is little deterioration in the water quality of the inner Volos
Bay, which is reasonable since most of the City is served by septic tanks and
the multiple outfalls provide good sewage dispersion. In the NW corner of the
Bay, near the mouth of the Xerias Creek there is, however, a strong dissolved
oxygen depression and high nutrient concentration. For the two bathing beaches
within the metropolitan area, bacterial contamination appears permanent but
moderate at Goritsa beach (eastern end of the City) and only sporadic at
Alykes beach (western shore of Volos Bay).
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives
4.01      The primary objective of the proposed project is to assist Greece
in implementing the reorganization of the sewerage sector, as outlined in
paragraph 2.10. Two priority pilot sewerage projects, for Salonica and Volos,
which have also major direct benefits, have been chosen for this purpose. In
pursuit of these sectoral objectives the project includes oceanographic, waste-
water reclamation, industrial wastewater and financial studies which have been
specifically designed to strengthen national capability for planning and carry-
ing out properly designed and financially sound priority investments in the
sewerage sector.



-7-
B.   General
4.02      The Salonica and Volos sewerage projects proposed for Bank financing
constitute only the first construction stage of the sewerage program for each
city. IBRD Maps Nos. 12212 and 12213 and Annexes 3 and 4 describe the entire
sewerage programs for both cities as well as the proposed schedules for subse-
quent construction stages. Population and water consumption projections used
in the preparation of these programs are tabulated in Annexes 5 and 6.
C.   Greater Salonica Sewerage
4.03      The proposed project, to be constructed during the period 197771981,
includes partial rehabilitation of the existing sewer network and extensions
of the network to the low-cost residential areas, plus the structures needed
to intercept, treat and discharge into the Axios River the wastewaters pre-
sently flowing into Salonica Bay. This project contemplates only physico-
chemical treatment of the wastewaters. Biological treatment (including
stabilization ponds) is not considered viable until the Government establishes
a program for controlling industrial liquid wastes and capable of effectively
preventing discharge of the toxic substances likely to inhibit biological pro-
cesses. Specifically, the project includes:
(a) installation of about 65 km of secondary sewers, 17 km of
trunk and force mains, and three pumping stations to serve
the coastal area and the Lagadas and Esso industrial zones;
(b) installation of about 8 km of gravity interceptors, 1 km of
force mains, and three pumping stations to intercept the
trunk mains discharging into Salonica Bay;
(c) construction of about 25 km of the main interceptor between
White Tower and the Axios River;
(d) construction of a physico-chemical primary treatment plant
with an initial capacity of about 3.9 m3/second; and
(e) purchase of equipment for sewer inspection and maintenance.
D.   Greater Volos Sewerage
4.04      The proposed project, to be constructed during the period 1977-1981,
includes the infrastructure to serve the population projected up to 1995,
pretreatment of the wastewater and all the secondary sewer networks which
can logistically be installed during that five-year span. Specifically,
the project includes:
(a) installation of about 113 km of secondary sewers, 18 km of
trunk and force mains and five pumping stations;
(b) construction of a pre-treatment plant with an initial
capacity of about 0.44 m3/second;
(c) installation of a collector of about 4 km, to carry waste-
water from the industrial estate to the pre-treatment plant;
and



-8-
(d) construction of a temporary effluent pumping station, an
8.1 km final interceptor and a 0.7 km ocean outfall to dis-
charge the pre-treated wastewater into the Pagasitikos Gulf.
E.   Studies and Training
4.05      The project also includes*the studies and surveys listed below.  At
the request of Government these studies and surveys have been designed to pro-
vide not only the data required for the Salonica and Volos sewerage projects
but mainly to develop guidelines and techniques which can be employed in other
cities. Detailed terms of reference are given in Annexes 7 to 10 and cost
estimates in Annex 11, pages 4 and 5. The studies and surveys are:
(a)  feasibility studies for the Mega Emvolon sewerage system
which would serve the southeastern part of Salonica metro-
politan area and which would be constructed by SSA as part
of its future investment program. These studies aim to
establish the first pilot project in Greece on the use of
wastewater effluents for irrigation and it is expected that
their results can be applied in other areas of the country;
(b)  industrial wastewater surveys in Salonica and Volos aimed
at establishing country-wide procedures on industrial waste-
water management;
(c)  oceanographic studies of the Thermaikos and Pagasitikos
Gulfs designed to establish country-wide procedures for
monitoring and evaluation of ocean water quality. They
include:
(i) monitoring of the receiving waters once the proposed
sewerage projects enter operation; and
(ii) establishment of a mathematical model to forecast the
cost of treatment for different types of industrial
developments and various criteria of water quality;
(d)  a review of accounting, financial control and tariff systems
of the Salonica Water Authority, Salonica Sewerage Authority
and Volos Water and Sewerage Authority, with a view to the
eventual implementation of systems more appropriate to the
operations of semi-autonomous water and sewerage authorities
throughout the country.
4.06      The project also includes provisions for training of senior staff
of the proposed Wastewater and Project Appraisal Departments of the MPW and
selected senior staff of the Ministry of Interior (MI) through short visits
to sewerage organizations and systems abroad.

4.08      The cost estimates were prepared by the mission, in consultation
with MPW and its consultants. Foreign exchange costs are based on the mis-
sion's estimate of the identifiable foreign exchange components of all ex-
penditures based on the assumptions about contracting explained in paragraph
4.12. Physical contingencies have been provided for as follows: 10% for
the collection system and 15% for treatment works and pumping stations. For
the Volos submarine outfall, which represents less than 1% of the total es-
timated project cost, a physical contingency of 25% has been used since data
on underwater subsoil conditions is not yet available. The project costs are
expressed in prices prevailing in January 1976 with provision for price in-
creases as follows:
Civil Works       Equipment
1976                                            14               10
1977 - 1979                                     12                8
1980 - 1982                                     10                7
G.   Implementation of Project
4.09-     The selection of engineering consultants for final project design
is a critical step for timely project execution. Agreement has been reached
that suitable consultants will be appointed for project final design and
supervision of construction before December 31, 1976 in accordance with terms
of reference acceptable to the Bank. Agreement has further been reached that
the Government will also appoint, before June 30, 1977 suitable consultants for
conducting various studies included in the project.
4.10      A tentative construction schedule for the entire project is given
in Annex 12. Agreement has been reached that the Government will prepare, in
consultation with the Bank, detailed construction schedules, which the Govern-
ment will review and update from time to time, as necessary, throughout the
construction period.
4.11      Project construction in each city will require the acquisition of
land and rights of way and the relocation of a small number of households.
Agreement has been reached that the land and rights of way will be acquired
in a timely manner, so as to prevent delays in the construction of the project.
Greek law provides for relocation of displaced residents.
H.   Procurement
4.12      Materials and equipment contracts estimated to cost more than
US$200,000 will be procured after international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank Group's guidelines. For awarding materials and equipment
contracts, it is proposed that qualified domestic manufacturers will be given
a margin of preference of 15% or customs duties, whichever is lower. Civil
works contracts expected to cost more than US$500,000 and which are estimated
to total about US$45 million, will be awarded after international competitive



- 11 -
bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's guidelines. Other equipment and
civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertised locally and in accordance with the procedures of the Ministry of
Public Works, which are acceptable. Pre-qualification of contractors will be
required for the Salonica treatment works and the Volos ocean outfall. In
other contracts the procurement procedures of MPW may also require pre-
qualification. Agreement has been reached that contracts will be grouped in
a manner acceptable to the Bank so as to facilitate the most efficient use of
international competitive bidding procedures. Minor works, such as service
connections and rehabilitation or replacement of secondary sewers, may be
carried out by SSA and/or VWSO, under arrangements acceptable to the Bank, up
to a total value of US$1.0 million.
4.13      Contracts for the supply of equipment for the sewage treatment plants
and pumping stations are expected to be awarded to foreign contractors. All
civil works contracts are expected to be won by Greek firms. In order to con-
tinue the necessary oceanographic studies and to enable final design to be
started, advance contracting is contemplated for work in 1976 by IOKAE and by
engineering consultants. Retroactive finance of up to US$100,000 is recom-
mended for expenditures on these studies and surveys incurred after June 30,
1976. About 220 man-months of consultants' services (including about 20 for
foreign consultants) are provided for, under the project, to carry out the
various studies. An additional 1200 man-months (250 foreign) are provided for
final design and project supervision of the two construction components but
this may be reduced by the additional involvement of MPW staff.
I.   Disbursements
4.14      The proposed loan would be disbursed over a 5-year period as follows:
(a)  24% of total expenditure on civil works carried out by contractors
and by SSA and/or VWSO, representing the estimated foreign exchange
component;
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures on contracts for equipment awarded
under international competitive bidding, or 100% of local ex-
penditures, ex-factory, in the unlikely event that such contracts
are won by local firms;
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures for consulting services; and
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures for training of staff.
The disbursement percentage under (a) related to civil works would be ad-
justed, if necessary, in order that withdrawals from the loan account would
continue throughout the implementation period of the project. Disbursements
for expenditures related to the work referred to in sub-paragraph (a) above,
by SSA and/or VWSO would be made against a statement of expenditures, with the
supporting documentation retained by the MPW and held available for inspection
during the course of a supervision mission. Normal documentation would be
required for all other items. Savings, if any, on completion of the project,
would be cancelled. An estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 14.



- 12 -
J.   Monitoring Criteria
4.15      Annex 13 shows the indicators which should be monitored by the
respective authorities and by the MPW during and after execution of the
project to measure the achievement of the technical, financial and admin-
istrative goals set for the project. These criteria were discussed during
negotiations and agreement reached that they will be implemented and reported
upon to the satisfaction of the Government and the Bank.
K.   Environmental and Health Impacts
4.16      The proposed Salonica sewerage project will prevent further deterio-
ration of the water quality of Salonica Bay, will eliminate the stench which
affects the City during part of the summer and eventually will allow the re-
establishment of fishing and the re-opening of bathing beaches. Within the
City, the project will eliminate the unsanitary conditions created by the
overloaded septic tanks serving the poorest areas and by the present discharge
of raw sewage into almost dry inland water courses. Adverse effects will
result from the discharge of primary effluent into the Axios River. Even
though these effects will be minimised by the use of chemical coagulation at
the treatment plant, they are expected to become serious enough to require,
by about 1995, either the upgrading of treatment or the construction of an
effluent sewer to the sea. Since the affected part of the Axios River is not
presently populated, these adverse effects will be far outweighed by the re-
sulting benefits of improved sanitation in and around the city.
4.17      In Volos, the proposed sewerage project will allow closing down a
large number of the septic tanks which constitute a serious threat to the
City's underlying aquifer and will stop the incipient deterioration of the
Bay's water quality. The preliminary oceanographic studies indicated that
at the proposed outfall location the sea can provide adequate dilution of
the pollutants expected up to 1995. Accordingly, no significant detrimental
effects are expected from the proposed outfall operation.
4.18      The oceanographic studies and industrial wastewater surveys included
in the project should have a country-wide impact on environmental matters since
they should lead to the establishment of adequate industrial wastewater manage-
ment and to effective measures for water pollution abatement.
V. THE BORROWER AND PROJECT ENTITIES
A.   General
5.01      The main objective of the present project is to initiate implementa-
tion of the Government's new policy for the sewerage sector outlined in para-
graph 2.10. The Salonica and Volos sewerage systems are considered pilot
projects to obtain this objective but it is understood that during their
construction, there will be a transition from the old to the new sewerage
sector policies. As indicated below, this transitional period has been an
important factor in the procedures agreed upon with Government for the exe-
cution of the project.



- 13 -
5.02      The new sewerage sector policy calls for the construction of new
sewerage systems by the local sewerage authorities. However, it has been
agreed that major responsibility for the management of the project should be
asssigned to the MPW because of the following:
(a) The Salonica Sewerage Authority (SSA) started operation only
in January 1976 and the Volos Water Supply and Sewerage
Organization (VWSO) is only now being created by Government
and, therefore, they have not yet developed the expertise to
undertake this large project.
(b) The industrial wastewater surveys and the oceanographic and
other technical studies included in the project were designed
to develop country-wide policies in water pollution control
and industrial wastewater management so that it is logical
that their supervision be assigned to the MPW.
5.03      The MPW is expected to award all contracts required for the execu-
tion of the project. It is intended, however, that the MPW will use the
project for training the local sewerage authorities so that they can under-
take, on their own, full operation and future expansions of their collection
systems (networks, trunk and force mains, interceptors and pumping stations).
It is expected therefore, that an increasing number of staff of the sewerage
authorities will be attached to the MPW units in charge of managing the
project. It is intended that by midway through the execution of the project,
the routine supervision of design and construction of collection system
components will be carried out, as part of their training, by staff of the
sewerage authorities working under the direction of the MPW. Supervision of
the design and construction of treatment and disposal facilities and of the
industrial and oceanographic surveys, wiil continue to be carried out by the
MPW staff but personnel of the sewerage authorities will participate in this
work to the extent required to enable them to operate and maintain their
entire sewerage systems. Agreement has been reached on specific proposals
for the management of the project in accordance with the above objectives
and a timetable established for attaching personnel of the local sewerage
authorities to the MPW units managing the project. MPW will keep financial
records of the project adequate to ensure that the books of the respective
project entities can record all necessary information to manage their finan-
cial operations to the satisfaction of the Government and the Bank.
B.   Ministry of Public Works
5.04      A description of the organization and administration of the Hydrau-
lics Division of MfPW is given in Annex 15. MPW conducts, through private
consultants and contractors, the design and construction of all important
sewerage works in the country. The design and construction are governed by
generally over-detailed and out-dated specifications and guidelines covering
only the collection components of sewerage systems as there is no experience
in Greece in wastewater treatment.



- 14 -
5.05      The preliminary oceanographic surveys conducted by IOKAE for the
MPW in Salonica and Volos were the first attempt made in Greece to evaluate
the environmental impact of sewerage projects. These surveys, made in accord-
ance with the terms of reference prepared by the Bank proved so successful
that MPW has requested IOKAE to conduct similar surveys for other sewerage
projects presently under study. To accomplish this work, IOKAE is expanding
its laboratory and recruiting additional staff. Since adequate monitoring of
the receiving waters is a basic requirement for any water pollution control
program, the Government intends that the proposed project be used to develop
IOKAE's expertise on monitoring of fresh and ocean waters.
5.06      MPW is fully aware of its shortcomings in the sewerage field and
to correct this situation is now in the process of establishing a Wastewater
Department within its Hydraulics Division. MPW intends to develop within this
department expertise in water pollution control, industrial wastewater manage-
ment and wastewater treatment and disposal processes. In accordance with the
Government's new sewerage sector policy, MPW expects to gradually shift its
responsibility for design and construction to the local water supply and
sewerage authorities so that the new Wastewater Department becomes eventually
a purely regulatory and advisory body at national level.
5.07      MPW will also establish within the Hydraulics Division a Project
Appraisal Department comprising engineers, economists and financial analysts
for appraising future water and sewerage projects. In addition, arrangements
will be made, through MI and MPW, as appropriate, for advising the local water
and sewerage authorities on financial management.
5.08      It is expected that specific training in sewage treatment, indus-
trial wastewater management and financial administration will be needed for
the staff of the newly established departments, and perhaps, also, by existing
staff of MI. Such training is likely to mainly comprise short visits, by
selected staff, to study relevant operations outside of Greece. The project
includes provision for the costs of such training.
5.09      Agreement has been reached that by June 30, 1977, staffing and train-
ing proposals will have been prepared, in consultation with the Bank, for the
Wastewater and Appraisal Departments of M.PW, and training proposals prepared
for the staff of MI. Such proposals are thereafter to be implemented to the
satisfaction of the Government and the Bank.
C.   Salonica
5.10      Public water supplies in Salonica are provided almost exclusively
by the Salonica Water Authority (SWA). Although SWA will not be directly
concerned with the construction aspects of the project, its levels of pro-
duction and distribution of water are crucial to the design and operation
of the sewerage systems. SWA will also act as agent in the collection of
sewer charges based on water consumption. Details of the present organiza-
tion of SWA are given in Annex 15.



- 15 -
5.11      Since January 1, 1976, sewerage services in Salonica have been
operated by the SSA. Details of the organization and administration of SSA
are given in Annex 15. At present, SSA is responsible for only part of the
Greater Salonica area and it is, therefore, necessary that its jurisdiction
be extended to cover the entire metropolitan area. A draft decree to ac-
complish this jurisdictional change has been submitted to the Bank. Passage
into law of relevant legislation satisfactory to the Bank is to be a condition
of loan disbursement on the Salonica project component. In addition, approval
of either this decree or of the legislation for Volos (para 5.19) is to be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
5.12      SSA is not expected to be fully staffed until the end of 1976.  The
present organization appears to have taken over its responsibilities in a
satisfactory manner and the staff already appointed are carrying out their
initial responsibilities competently. However, the authority is subject to
the civil service procedures and regulations described in Annex 15 which will
become an increasing constraint upon efficient operations. Furthermore, its
present accounting system is inadequate for providing meaningful information
for management, planning and financial control. These problems are addressed
in paragraphs 5.22 and 5.23 below.
5.13      Until now, the financial direction of SSA has been in the hands of
temporary staff. Agreement has been reached that SSA will appoint a qualified
and experienced finance director and will otherwise be staffed with adequate
numbers of qualified personnel.
5.14      There is consensus for the merging of SSA with SWA into a joint
water supply and sewerage authority. It is recognized, however, that present
administrative and financial procedures in SSA and SWA are unsatisfactory and
must be modified in accordance with the results of the financial studies in-
cluded in this project (Annex 7), before the merger can take place. Further-
more, during the immediate future, SSA will need to devote its resources to
developing its responsibilities for the existing sewerage system and to the
gradual taking over of responsibility for supervision of project construc-
tion.
5.15      The terms of reference for the financial studies (Annex 7) provide
that they should be conducted considering the eventual merging of SSA and SWA,
but agreement has been reached that no merger will take place until the
studies have been completed.
5.16      Prior to any intended merging of SSA and SWA, the Government should
present to the Bank a draft of their proposals, including financial forecasts
and details of the accounting and financial control procedures which will
govern the joint authority. Agreement has been reached that no merger will
take place until the Bank is satisfied that the joint authority will be able
to operate in a financially viable manner, and that the merger will not be
detrimental to its technical operations.



- 16 -
5.17      Unless and until SSA and SWA are merged, it is expected that SWA
will continue to collect sewerage charges on behalf of SSA by appropriate ad-
ditions to the billings of water consumers connected to the sewerage system.
The present computerized billing system appears satisfactory, and it has
been agreed that joint billing for water and sewerage charges will continue,
unless adequate alternative arrangements are developed to the satisfaction
of the Bank.
D.   Volos
5.18      As indicated in Annex 15, there are several water supply systems
operating in the greater Volos area. The principal water authority is the
Volos Municipal Water and Sewerage Authority (VMWSA), which also operates a
limited sewerage system and (on an agency basis) the water supply system of
the Industrial Estate. The Municipality of Nea Ionea and the various town-
ships within the metropolitan area operate small water supply systems and
some consumers are supplied by privately owned wells.
5.19      The Government has agreed upon the need for regionalization of water
and sewer services and has prepared draft legislation to create a Volos Water
and Sewerage Organization (VWSO) for the entire Greater Volos area. 1/ This
draft has been discussed with Bank staff and a revised draft is now under
preparation. The new law proposes to establish an authority independent of
the various municipalities, but with municipal representation on its managing
board. Government administrative supervision will be by the Ministry of
Interior (MI). The law is to contain a clause to enable its provisions to be
extended to other areas in Greece, as appropriate, by Presidential Decree.
The passage into law of relevant legislation satisfactory to the Bank is to be
a condition of loan disbursement on the Volos project component. In addition,
approval of either this legislation or of similar legislation for Salonica
(para 5.11) is to be a condition of loan effectiveness.
5.20      VMWSA, which is expected to form the nucleus for VWSO, is reasonably
well operated but is subject to similar financial and administrative controls
to SSA and SWA and its accounting and budgetary systems are inappropriate.
There is no general manager, and heads of departments report directly to the
Mayor of Volos, as Chairman of the authority. The financial regulations re-
quire the involvement of board members in certain of the day-to-day opera-
tions, such as certifying the proper receipt of purchased goods.
5.21      VMWSA has a competent chief accountant, its financial controls and
procedures work as intended and the computerized billing system is reason-
ably effective. In the reorganization, VWSO will need to recruit a general
manager and increase its engineering capability. Agreement has been reached,
therefore, that VWSO will appoint a competent general manager within six
months of the passage into law of legislation establishing VWSO and other-
wise will be adequately staffed. VWSO will maintain separate accounts for
its water supply and sewerage services.
1/   Formally titled the "Water and Sewerage Municipal Organization for the
Greater Volos Area".



- 17 -
E.   Accounting and Financial Control
5.22      As indicated in Annex 15 all three authorities to be concerned with
the project (SSA, SWA and VWSO) must comply with detailed government regula-
tions and financial controls based on civil service procedures. These are
largely inappropriate. Concurrently, budgetary and accounting arrangements
are kept on a simple cash basis which do not facilitate the type of financial
planning and decision-making necessary for an authority of this type.
5.23      Consequently, the project includes a study of accounting and finan-
cial controls at the three authorities, to be carried out by a competent firm
of accounting consultants. Suggested terms of reference for this study are
given in Annex 7. Agreement has been reached that before June 30, 1977,
suitable consultants will be recruited to perform this study in accordance
with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. Following the receipt of
the consultants proposals, suitable accounting systems and financial controls,
satisfactory to the Government and the Bank, will be implemented by each of
the three authorities, with the assistance of the reporting consultants or
other suitable consultants.
F.   Audit
5.24      At present, the three authorities do not prepare appropriate annual
financial statements nor are they subject to adequate audits. Each authority
prepares an analytical statement of cash receipts and disbursements which is
forwarded with supporting documents and vouchers to an audit office of the
Ministry of Finance. Here the documents are checked, but it is often several
years before they are returned to the originating authority. This is unsa-
tisfactory.
5.25      It is the law and practice in Greece for certain independent authori-
ties financed and controlled by Government (e.g. the Greek Telephone Company)
to have their accounts audited by "sworn accountants" who are members of a
special institute set up for this purpose. Such audits do not, at present
apply to water and sewerage authorities. The members of the institute have
received an accounting education and are required to follow accounting rules
prescribed by Government. The audit practices of the institute are not neces-
sarily consistent with those adopted by international accounting firms.
5.26      Agreement has been reached that SSA and VWSO will prepare suitable
annual financial statements, which will be audited in a manner acceptable to
the Bank, by qualified and independent accountants satisfactory to the Bank
and be submitted to the Bank within four months of the close of each fiscal
year.

VI. FINANCE
A.   General
6.01      The borrower would be the Government of Greece, with proportions on-
lent to SSA and VWSO towards their respective project construction costs. The
Government will enter into subsidiary agreements, satisfactory to the Bank, with
each of the two beneficiaries. The execution of either of these agreements is
to be a condition of loan effectiveness and the execution of the other a condi-
tion of disbursement on the project component to which it relates. Each agree-
ment will cover on-lending conditions, other financing, project implementation
and obligations undertaken on behalf of each beneficiary under the loan agree-
ment. The proceeds of the Bank loan would be allocated as follows:
US$ Million
Salonica Construction                 29.5
Volos Construction                     6.1
Studies and Training                   0.4
36.0
The Government will provide counterpart funds for the various studies and
make available capital finance, in the form of loans or equity contributions,
to cover the balance of project costs in Salonica and Volos, to the extent
not covered from other sources. Agreement has been reached that the Govern-
ment will provide all necessary funds (including funds to cover costs in
excess of present estimates) to ensure timely completion of the project, to
the extent that such funds are not available from other sources. Such funds
are to be provided on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
B.   Salonica
Present Financial Position
6.02      The responsible project authority, SSA, began full operations only
on January 1, 1976. Pro-forma financial statements are given in Annex 17
and explained in Annex 18. The income statement for 1976 indicates that if
SSA kept its accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples, it would incur a loss of about Dr 30 million, mainly because the re-
structured accounts recognize depr-eciation as an operating expense, whereas
SSA's present budgetary procedures ignore this. However, the funds flow
statement shows that, without borrowing, SSA is expected to have a cash sur-
plus amounting to about Dr 5 million at the end of 1976. The pro-forma bal-
ance sheet of SSA as of January 1, 1976 prepared from such data as available
and using rough engineering estimates for the value of the present *sewer sys-
tem, is as follows:



- 19 -
Dr (million)
Fixed Assets (at valuation)                1,200.0
Current Assets
Investments                             175.5
Cash                                      9.7
Equity Capital                             1,385.2
6.03      No loans were apparently taken over by SSA from its predecessors,
so it began its operations with a debt-free system. Investments represent
mainly the balance of property tax collections from 1972, the proceeds of
which are retained in a separate bank account, and not available for general
use without ministerial authority.
Financing Plan
6.04      The following table shows SSA's total funds requirements for the
period of project construction and the sources from which they would be met.

/1   Excluding Dr 165.9 million (US$4.7 million) estimated to be disbursed
in 1982.
6.05      An explanation of the various components of the financing plan is
given in Annex 16. Since the financing plan does not allow for the necessary
funds to provide customers with credit facilities to cover connection fees and
consumer contributions, agreement has been reached that the Government will
provide SSA, or cause SSA to be provided with, the necessary funds on suitable
terms for this purpose.
6.06      Annex 17 gives details of SSA's estimated financial operations from
1976-1985. These forecasts take account of the project, additional extensions
during the project period, and a further program of expansion from 1982 to 1985



- 21 -
as shown in Annex 11 (page 2). It is assumed that all capital finance not pro-
vided from other sources will be in the form of government loans, though the
Government may choose to arrange some of the financing from other sources
(e.g. banks).
6.07      The repayment terms of the Bank loan have been set in accordance
with recent changes in Bank policies and are therefore influenced by country
considerations. However they can still be regarded as appropriate for the
project, because of the commitment of the Government to provide additional
funds on acceptable terms, and for the reasons explained below. In accord-
ance with Bank practice, it has been agreed that the appropriate proportion
of the Bank loan would be on-lent to SSA on the same terms as agreed between
the Bank and the Government, thus providing for amortization over 12 years
following the 3-year grace period.   The repayment period is somewhat shorter
than that normally associated with sewerage projects of this type and will
impose an additional burden on SSA's funds flow during the years immediately
following project completion. Consequently, SSA's financial requirements
will be dominated by cash needs during these years. However, this will be
mitigated by the fact that the SSA has taken over a debt-free system and also
that a substantial proportion of its capital expenditures will be financed by
non-returnable allocations of property tax.
Tariffs
6.08      A schedule of tariffs, together with an explanation of various as-
pects of tariff policies, are given in Annex 21. Tariffs at the present time
are far too low, largely because they have been arbitrarily fixed by law at
40% of water tariffs, which in no way reflects the present costs, and will
reflect future costs of providing the service still less. The present water
supply system has in the past been based on relatively inexpensive tubewells.
By contrast, the proposed new sewer system, with its long interceptor to the
Axios River and large treatment facilities is relatively expensive. These
facts tend to support the evidence of the financial forecasts, that sewerage
tariffs are likely to be at least equal to, and probably in excess of, water
tariffs. Any substantial amendment to sewerage tariffs will, therefore,
require an amendment to the law. Agreement has been reached that passage
into law of a suitable amendment, removing the fixed ratio between water
and sewerage tariffs, is to be a condition of loan effectiveness, or dis-
bursement.
6.09      Another difficulty is that certain premises, particularly industrial
premises, are served by privately owned wells for water and yet will be con-
nected to the sewer system. Although SWA expects to be able to serve most of
these premises with water in due course, it cannot collect water charges and
related sewer charges until this is done. Agreement has been reached that a
satisfactory system of sewer charges will be implemented for all users, in-
cluding those supplied with water from private wells, no later than December
31, 1977.
6.10      Even when the law is amended, certain inequities will still continue.
As indicated in Annex 21, the Salonica Water Authority (SWA) has a tariff
schedule which gives discounts to various classes of consumer and which are
not entirely appropriate. The Government has requested that guidance and



- 22 -
assistance in the review of SWA's tariff structures be provided as part of the
study of accounting and financial controls to be carried out under the project
(para 4.05 (d)). Agreement has been reached that SWA, on completion of this
review, will provide the Bank, for its comments, with detailed proposals for
improvement of its tariff structures, taking into consideration all categories
of water users. SWA will, promptly thereafter, establish tariffs based on
those proposals and on the Bank's comments. SWA will also extend water
metering to all categories of water users. The principal objectives are to
develop a tariff under which the users pay all costs, which does not unduly
burden low-income consumers and which encourages a rational use of water
resources. Consideration will also be given to the provision of a minimum
supply at low prices to assist those consumers unable to afford supplies at
the standard price. Present free supplies (e.g. to the municipality) will
be fully metered and arrangements considered whereby payment for such sup-
plies be made from other public revenues.
6.11      If SSA is to become reasonably financially viable by the end of the
project period, and to cover its funds requirements thereafter, tariffs will
have to be substantially raised over the next few years. In 1977, even if
present tariffs are doubled, SSA will still incur a loss after depreciation
of about Dr 12.0 million. Because of the necessity to change the law (para
6.08) such an increase will not be possible until some time after January 1,
1977. Agreement has been reached that SSA will double its average sewerage
tariffs presently in force when this is legally permitted. This increase is
to take place no later than three months following the execution of a sub-
sidiary agreement, which is to be a condition of loan effectiveness or dis-
bursement (para 6.01).
6.12      Agreement has been further reached that SSA will, thereafter, set
its sewerage tariffs so that in each fiscal year revenues from operations
(excluding property taxes) will provide for:
(1) expenses of operation and maintenance (excluding depre-
ciation), debt service, adequate increases in working
capital, taxes, dividends and other distribution of
earnings; and
(2) a minimum contribution from internal funds 1/ towards
capital investment amounting to a percentage of the
net value of fixed assets in operation and under con-
struction of 4% until 1981 and 2% thereafter.
The average annual tariffs estimated to be necessary to achieve these
objectives until 1982 (Annex 17, Table 4) are as follows:
Fiscal Year                           Dr per m3
1977                                  4.0
1978                                  5.5
1979                                  7.0
1980                                  9.0
1981                                 12.0
1982                                 13.0
1/   Including non-industrial consumer contributions (Annex 18, para 10).



- 23 -
6.13      Following substantial completion of the proposed industrial waste-
water survey, SSA will, in consultation with the Bank, develop an appropriate
schedule of industrial wastewater surcharges, to be formally approved and
implemented by December 31, 1979.
Future Performance
6.14      If the tariffs are implemented as above, and if the terms of loans
are assumed, SSA could be expected to earn a rate of return of between 5% and
6% in every year from 1981 onwards. Present average tariffs of Dr 1.95
(US$0.06) per m3 would increase to about Dr 13.00 (US$0.37) per m3. The
debt:equity ratio of SSA would peak at 50:50 in 1981, falling thereafter to
about 37:63 by 1985. After the project period, between 20% and 30% would be
contributed from internal funds towards construction, which, in the light of
the accelerated debt amortization, is reasonable. Property taxes would finance
additional construction. Debt service coverage would be 1.4-1.5 times in each
year following project construction. Agreement has been reached that SSA will
not raise further loans beyond the project period, without the concurrence of
the Bank, unless its net cash earnings before depreciation and interest exceed
1.3 times its debt service in any future year, including debt service on the
amount to be borrowed. In the event of the merging of SSA and SWA, the above
requirements may need to be modified, as explained in para 5.16.
C.   Volos
Present Financial Position
6.15      Pro-forma financial statements are given in Annex 19 and explained
in Annex 20. Because the accounts of the Volos area authorities are kept on
a simple cash basis, only approximate information can be given as to past per-
formance. However, income statements for 1974 and 1975 have been constructed,
using available information and combining the activities for the entire
Volos area. These income statements are shown in Annex 19.
6.16      The statements indicate that, for the time being, because of the
small size and inadequate nature of the present sewerage system, the 40%
sewerage charge, together with the 10% stormwater surcharge, brings about
a more than adequate financial performance for the sewerage system, relative
to water. This is confirmed by the financial projections in Annex 19, Table
3, which shows very high rates of return for sewerage before the new system
comes into operation. In 1976, if a combined authority were in existence, the
water service would earn a net income before interest of Dr 1.9 million, with
a rate of return of about 1%. The sewerage service would earn a net income
before interest of Dr 3.3 million with a very high (but rather meaningless)
rate of return of about 25%.
6.17      The pro-forma balance sheet for the combined area, as at December
31, 1975 prepared from such data as available, and using rough engineering
estimates for the value of the present water and sewer systems, is also given
in Annex 19. The loan debt of Dr 37.5 million is represented by 9 loans, of
which 7 are for VMWSA and one each for the Municipality of Nea Ionea and the



- 24 -
Commune of Dimini. All have been raised from various branches of Government,
or (in one case) from the Municipality of Volos. Interest rates vary from
interest-free to 6% (average about 2.5%) with repayment typically over about
20 years.

1/   Excluding Dr 20.9 million (US$0.6 million) estimated to be disbursed in
1982.
6.19      An explanation of the various components of the financing plan is
given in Annex 16. Since the financing plan does not allow for the necessary
funds to provide customers with credit facilities to cover connection fees and
consumer contributions, agreement has been reached that the Government will
provide VWSO, or cause VWSO to be provided with, the necessary funds on
suitable terms for this purpose.



- 25 -
6.20      Annex 19 gives details of VWSO's estimated financial operations from
1976-1985. These forecasts take account of the project, and of additional
extensions to the sewer network following project completion. Provision is
also included for additional extensions to the water distribution system
during the whole period and for the possible development of an additional
source of water supply in the years 1984 and 1985.
6.21      It is assumed that all capital finance beyond the project period,
not provided from other soures, will be in the form of government loans,
though the Government may choose to arrange some of the financing from other
sources (e.g. banks).
6.22      As in the case of Salonica, it has been agreed that the appropriate
proportion of Bank loan would be on-lent to VWSO on the same terms as agreed
between the Bank and the Government, thus providing for amortization over 12
years, following the 3-year grace period. Since the repayment period is
somewhat shorter than that normally associated with sewerage projects of this
type it will impose an additional burden on VWSO's funds flow during the years
immediately following project completion. Consequently, VWSO's financial
requirements will be dominated by cash needs during these years.
6.23      Unlike the case of SSA, which already has a large equity base in
the form of its existing sewerage system, VWSO must establish a new system,
which cannot be placed in operation until substantially completed and where
construction logistics will prevent full utilization during the first few
years following completion. When these facts are combined with the funds flow
problems outlined above, it is clear that it would not be reasonable to base
tariffs merely upon funds requirements of a largely debt-financed system
during the years immediately following construction, particularly since the
repayment periods are relatively short. 1/ Consequently, tariffs must reflect
cost recovery over a longer time period (Annex 22), and the Government intends
that the immediate burden upon funds flow be mitigated by the provision of a
proportion of the Government counterpart funds in the form of equity (grant)
during the period of project construction.
Tariffs
6.24      A schedule of tariffs and information regarding tariff policies is
given in Annex 21. Present water tariffs appear to be too low, earning a rate
of return of only about 1%. To increase this rate of return, and to provide
for an increasing contribution towards capital investment in water and sewerage
projects, tariffs should be raised. If VWSO were already operating, it would
be appropriate to increase water tariffs by 20% on January 1, 1977 and by a
1/   Preliminary calculations indicate that such a tariff would average
about Dr 18 per m3 (US$0.51 per m3). The present charge in Fairfax
County, Virginia averages about US$0.30 per m3. In Tunisia, the
present charge is equivalent to about US$0.10 per m3.



- 26 -
further 20% on January 1, 1978. These increases, followed by relatively minor
changes thereafter would increase the rate of return on the water service to
within the range of 7%-8%, which is acceptable. However, because of time
needed for the legislative process, VWSO will not be in operation until some
time after January 1, 1977. Since it is not now appropriate to introduce new
tariffs until the new authority is in operation, a new tariff introduced later
in 1977 might be followed too closely by the second increase to be acceptable.
Consequently, the two increases should be combined. Agreement has been
reached that, following the establishment of VWSO, present water tariffs,
together with related sewer tariffs, will be increased by an average of 45%.
This increase is to take place no later than three months following the
execution of the subsidiary agreement which is to be a condition of loan
effectiveness or disbursement (para 6.01).
6.25      Apart from bearing a more realistic relationship to cost recovery,
increased tariffs will help to improve VWSO's cash flow during the project
period.  Because there are very few sewer customers, served in any event by
a totally inadequate system, VWSO cannot look to its sewer operations for
any significant generation of funds during project construction. Fortunately,
the Volos area is adequately provided with water for a number of years and
funds generated from the water system can be used for sewerage construction.
6.26      As in Salonica, the tariff schedule of VMWSA gives arbitrary dis-
counts to various classes of consumers and the Government has made a similar
request for assistance in the review of tariff structures as part of the
project financial studies (para 4.05 (d)). Agreement has been reached that
VWSO, on completion of this review, will provide the Bank, for its comments,
with detailed proposals for improvement of its tariff structures taking into
account all categories of water users. VWSO will promptly thereafter estab-
lish tariffs based on these proposals and on the Bank's comments. VWSO will
also extend water metering to all categories of water users by December, 1977.
As in Salonica, the principal objectives are to develop a tariff under which
the users pay all costs, which does not unduly burden low-income consumers
and which encourages a rational use of water resources. Consideration will
be given to the provision of a minimum supply at low prices to assist those
consumers unable to afford supplies at the standard price. Consideration will
also be given to the establishment of differential tariff arrangements for
consumers in the different areas to comprise the new VWSO authority area,
along the lines explained in Annex 21. Present free supplies (e.g. to the
municipality) will be fully metered and arrangements considered whereby
payment for such supplies be made from other public revenues.
6.27      The changes in water tariffs discussed above will contribute to-
wards the establishment of VWSO as a financially viable enterprise. However,
when the new sewerage system begins to operate, substantially higher sewerage
tariffs will be necessary and they will no longer be able to be based on the
present fixed 40% of water charges. It is intended that the new law estab-
lishing VWSO will contain no provision to link future sewerage tariffs to a
fixed proportion of related water tariffs. Instead sewerage tariffs will be
based on cost recovery. As in Salonica, a number of sewer users will continue



- 27 -
to be supplied with water from privately owned wells, thus precluding a sewer-
age surcharge based on water supplied by VWSO. Agreement has been reached
that a satisfactory system of sewer charges will be implemented for all users,
including those supplied with water from private wells, no later than December
31, 1977. Industrial enterprises in the Industrial Estate do not, at present,
pay a sewerage surcharge, even though connected to a sewerage system (albeit
with crude discharge to a streambed). VWSO will therefore extend the system
of sewerage surcharges to the Industrial Estate, no later than December 31,
1977.
6.28      The various changes in tariffs discussed above should ensure reason-
able financial viability for VWSO until December 31, 1978. Agreement has been
reached that, in addition to the initial increase, VWSO will set and maintain
its tariffs so that in each fiscal year, total revenues from water and sewerage
operations will provide for:
(1) expenses of operation and maintenance (excluding deprecia-
tion), debt service, adequate increases in working capital,
taxes, dividends and other distributions of earnings; and
(2) a minimum contribution from internal funds 1/ towards
capital investment amounting to a percentage of the net
value of fixed assets in operation and under construction
of 4% until 1981 and 1.5% thereafter.
The average annual tariffs estimated to be necessary to achieve these objec-
tives until 1981 (Annex 19, Table 7) are as follows:
Fiscal Year                                   Dr. per m3
Water Sewerage
1977                                      9.6       3.8
1978                                      9.6       3.8
1979                                     10.1       4.0
1980                                     10.1      11.5
1981                                     10.4      14.0
6.29      Following the substantial completion of the proposed industrial
wastewater survey, VWSO will, in consultation with the Bank, develop an
appropriate schedule of industrial wastewater surcharges, to be formally
approved and implemented by December 31, 1979.
Future Performance
6.30      If the above tariff principles are adopted, VWSO could be expected
to achieve reasonable financial viability with an average sewer charge which
would increase from its present level of Dr. 2.50 (US$0.07) per m3 to about
Dr 14 (US$ 0.40) per m3 from January 1981. This charge would be about 35% in
excess of the water tariff. However, with an increasing number of sewer users
being connected to the system in the years following the project the sewer
charge should not require any substantial further increase for several years
and by 1985 might be only a little above the water charge.
1/ Including non-industrial consumer contributions (Annex 20, para 11)



- 28 -
6.31      VWSO could be expected to earn an overall rate of return on its
joint water and sewerage operations of about 3.5-4% from 1981 onwards. The
debt: equity ratio would rise from about 20:80 in 1976 to about 45:55 by 1981
thereafter remaining fairly constant. After the project period, between 25%
and 50% would be contributed from internal funds towards construction, which,
in the light of the accelerated debt amortization, is reasonable. Debt service
coverage would be 1.4-1.5 times in each year following project construction.
Agreement has been reached that VWSO will not raise further loans beyond the
project period, without the concurrence of the Bank, unless its net cash
earnings before depreciation and interest exceed 1.3 times its debt service
in any future year, including debt service on the amount to be borrowed.
D.   Fixed Asset Valuation
6.32      Because of the present accounting system, fixed asset valuations
cannot be regarded as very accurate. Agreement has been reached that SSA
and VWSO will establish reasonable valuations of fixed assets by December 31,
1977. Because such valuations have not yet been established and because asset
values will be dominated by costs of the new project, annual revaluations have
not been used in the financial projections.
VII. JUSTIFICATION
A.   General
7.01      The main benefits of the proposed construction of sewage collec-
tion, treatment and disposal facilities in Salonica and Volos are listed in
Annex 23. These benefits, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive,
include health benefits, property value increases and recreational benefits,
which would result from the removal of wastewaters from inland areas and the
improvement of coastal waters and beaches for fishing and swimming. However,
the overriding justification is that the systems are necessary for the order-
ly development of these cities and that the proposed methods of collection,
treatment and disposal of sewage are adequate and represent the least cost
solutions for each locality.
B.   Institutional
7.02      Greece needs to improve the design, construction and operation of
its urban sewerage systems and to develop adequate procedures for water pollu-
tion control and industrial wastewater management, but its technical and ad-
ministrative capabilities in these fields are not yet adequate. The develop-
ment and construction of the Salonica and Volos projects will enable the con-
cerned Greek authorities to develop the required expertise in these fields.
This will then enable the authorities to more confidently proceed with the
development of sewerage systems in other urban areas. Significantly, many
of the lessons expected to be learned in the development of sewerage systems
in Salonica and Volos will be of value to the Government in developing and
implementing its proposals for Athens (para 2.09).

C.   Economic and Financial
7.03      A minimum estimate of the benefits of sewage collection and disposal
cannot be derived through customers' observed willingness to pay since (a)
for reasons of public health, financial viability and orderly development,
consumers will be required to connect to the sewerage systems, thus distort-
ing the free expression of value which they place upon the system, and (b)
the surcharge on water which consumers currently pay for sewerage services
may reflect the additional amount (i.e. consumers' surplus) which they are
willing to pay for water. For this reason, tariffs cannot be subjected to
meaningful economic analysis, but Annex 22 shows that the proposed tariffs
broadly relate to requirements for long-term cost recovery.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      Agreement has been reached on the various issues referred to in
Chapters III to VI of this report, including the following matters of partic-
ular significance:
(a)  MPW will prepare and implement staffing and training proposals
for newly-created Wastewater and Appraisal Departments of its
Hydraulics Division (para 5.09);
(b)  a review of accounting financial controls and tariff systems will
be carried out and satisfactory accounting systems, financial con-
trols and tariff systems implemented by SWA, SSA and VWSO, with
the assistance of suitable consultants (para 5.23);
(c)  SSA will set its sewerage tariffs to meet appropriate cash
generation criteria and also develop an appropriate schedule
of industrial wastewater surcharges (paras 6.12 and 6.13); and
(d)  VWSO will set water and sewerage tariffs to meet appropriate
cash generation criteria and also develop an appropriate schedule
of industrial wastewater surcharges (paras 6.24, 6.28 and 6.29).
8.02      Either of the following, whichever occurs first, is to be a condition
of loan effectiveness:
(a)  approval of legislation to extend the jurisdictional boundaries
of SSA (para 5.11) and the execution of a satisfactory agreement
between the Government and SSA (to include provisions for ini-
tial tariff increases) (para 6.01); or
(b)  approval of legislation to create a regional water and
sewerage authority for the Greater Volos area (para 5.19)
and the execution of a satisfactory agreement between the
Government and VWSO (to include provisions for initial
tariff increases (para 6.01).
Whichever of these alternatives does not occur first will be a condition of
loan disbursement for that project component to which it relates.



- 30 -
8.03      An additional condition of effectiveness or disbursement for Salonica
is to be a change in the law to permit sewerage tariffs to be related to cost
instead of representing a fixed percentage of water tariffs (para 6.08).
8.04      Agreement having been reached upon the various matters outlined
above, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$36 million to the Govern-
ment of Greece, repayable over 15 years, including a 3-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Existing Water Supply and Sewer Systems of Greater Salonica
A.   Metropolitan Area
1.        Greater Salonica is located in the region of Macedonia (north east-
ern shores of the Aegean Sea) at the head of the Thermaikos Gulf. It is the
second largest population and industrial center of Greece, covering an area
of about 24,800 ha. and including six municipalities and 22 townships.
2.        The metropolitan area extends for about 70 km along the shores of
the Salonica Bay (cul-de-sac at the northern end of the Thermaikos Gulf) from
the Axios River on the west to the Cape of Mega Emvolon on the south east.
Three rivers (Axios, Gallikos and Dendropotamos) cross the metropolitan area.
The Gallikos and Dendropotamos carry waters only during the rainy season and
flow into the Salonica Bay. The Axios, originating in Yugoslavia is the only
river of permanent flow and discharges outside of Salonica Bay into the
Thermaikos Gulf.
3.        The City of Salonica itself occupies a long and narrow strip of
land between the northern shore of Salonica Bay and the Asvestohorion hills
and the Hortiatis Mount. The Dendropotamos river used to be the western
boundary of the urban area but presently the City is rapidly expanding west-
ward to the Gallikos river. The City is also spreading to the east and south
east toward the Micra airport located on the northeastern shore of Salonica
Bay.
4.        West of the City, between the Gallikos and Axios rivers, lies an
extensive valley presently dedicated to agriculture but which constitutes
the largest area for future urban development. The shores of the western
sector are made up of low marshy grounds of little urban potential but where
construction of large port facilities is presently under consideration.
5.        The eastern sector of the metropolitan area is a triangular shaped
piece of land extending along the eastern shore of the Salonica Bay from
Micra airport at the north narrowing down to the Cape of Mega Emvolon in the
south. This sector contains the bathing beaches of Perea and Aghia Trias,
which attract a large number of tourists during the summer. Its potential
for urban development is limited because of its topography.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
6.        Three industrial zones (Lagadas, Esso and Gallikos) are located
north of the City but within present urban boundaries. A fourth industrial
zone (Axios) is under development on the eastern bank of the Axios river.
Today the industrial zones cover an area of about 1,840 ha, provide employ-
ment for about 70,000 people and house 240 industries: oil refinery, petro-
chemicals, paper, metallurgy, textiles, plastics, leather, food and beverages,
drugs, etc. The Hellenic Industrial Development Bank estimates that the four
industrial zones will occupy an area of 3,000 ha by 1990 and 4,300 ha by the
year 2015.
B.   Demographic Growth
7.        During the last census decade (1961-1971) Salonica became the fast-
est growing of the Greek cities with an average annual growth rate of 3.8%.
Industrial development in nearby smaller cities during the early years of the
present decade have already reduced the annual growth rate of Salonica to an
estimated 3.5% for the period 1971-1975. A rapid decrease in the number of
house construction permits issued during the last two years tends to indicate
further reduction of the past growth rate.
8.        Because of its geographical location, Salonica has, however, a po-
tential for further accelerated growth. Salonica is the natural gateway of
the Balkans and Central Europe to the Mediterranean and through the recently
re-opened Suez Canal to East Africa and the Far East. Yugoslavia, Bulgaria
and Romania are presently improving their in-land connections to Salonica and
linking them to the existing northern road network, so it is expected that
the growing trade between Central Europe and the oil-producing countries of
the Middle East will be carried out through the Salonica port and would
result in accelerated urban growth.
C.   Existing Water Supply System
9.        An important aquifer underlying the western sector of the metro-
politan area and some minor springs on the slopes of Mount Hortiatis have
been to date the only sources of drinking and industrial waters for Salonica.
However, well construction has not kept up with the urban growth and Greater
Salonica has suffered chronic water shortages. During the summer months the
yield of the well-fields diminish considerably and severe constraints are
imposed on the use of water.
10.       The present municipal water sources are:
(a) The Sindos well field located between the Gallikos and Axios
rivers with a yield of 35-55,000 m3/day.
(b) The Kalshorion well field on the eastern bank of the Gallikos
river with a yield of 30-40,000 m3/day.
(c) The Navres well field on the upper reaches of the Gallikos
river with a yield of 20-50,000 m3/day.



ANNEX I
Page 3
(d) The small well fields of Lebet, Kalamaria and Stavroupolis
with a combined average yield of about 8,200 m3/day.
(e) The Hortiatis and Retziki Springs with a combined average
yield of about 750 m3/day.
In addition, there are a large number of privately-owned wells which are op-
erated mainly by some of the industrial concerns and townships.
11.       The Salonica Water Authority (SWA) serves most of the metropolitan
area and presently provides about 70% of the industrial water. Some of the
townships are served by local supplies which are, in some cases, supplemented
with water purchased from the SWA. The total length of the distribution sys-
tem is about 750 km and has been increasing during recent years at a rate of
25-30 km/year.
12.       Estimated water consumption during 1974 is tabulated below:
Estimated 1974 Water Consumptions - Millions m3/year
Premises                                SWA         Private Wells         Total
Domestic                                21.1              2.6              23.7
Industrial Zones                        13.0             4.5               17.5
Industries within urban area             0.4             0.7                1.1
Total                              34.5             7.8              42.3
Total population served during 1974 was estimated at 612,000 and the total
area of the industrial zones at 1,840 ha. Unitary water consumptions were
then 106 lpcd for domestic use and 9,500 m3/ha/year (0.30 lps/ha) for the
industrial zones.
13.       Total water produced by the SWA during 1974 was estimated at 47.5
million m3 (130,000 m3/day) showing a volume of unaccounted for water of 13.0
million m3 (27%). Since unmetered water is supplied to schools, public build-
ings and for some municipal uses, it is impossible to estimate actual water
losses in the system.
14.       A new well field with an estimated average yield of 50,000 m3/day
is being completed on the banks of the Axios river. A sum of 125 million
drachmas has been included in this year's budget to complete the Axios well
field by late 1976. An additional well field (Aravissos) with an average
yield of 215,000 m3/day is also under construction about 65 km northwest of
the City. This field is expected to enter operation in late 1977, and to
complete its construction, sums of 250 and 270 million drachmas have been
budgeted in 1976 and 1977 respectively. These two new well fields should
triple present water production capacity and should be sufficient to serve
the expected population and industrial growth up to 1995.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
15.       Future sources of water supply presently under study are:
(a) The Aliakmon river, located about 70 km west of the City. Its
average yield is estimated at 450,000 m3/day and its construc-
tion cost at 695 million drachmas (1975 prices).
(b) The Migdonia aqueduct, with intake at Volvi Lake about 40 km
east of the City. Its average yield is estimated at 275,000
m3/day.
D.   Existing Sewer System
16.       Since January 1 of this year, the existing sewer system is operated
by the recently created Salonica Sewer Authority. It has a length of about
250 km and partially serves 6 municipalities and 13 townships with an estimated
1975 population of 651,600. The remaining 9 townships, with an estimated 1975
population of 19,500 are served only by septic tanks. In early 1975, there
were 51,600 known connections to the sewer system plus a large number of
illegal sewer connections to the stormwater network.
17.       The downtown area of the City (160 ha) was sewered during the 1930's
with a combined network discharging into the inner Salonica Bay through the
White Tower submarine outfall. This combined system was gradually extended
to the north sector of the City and recently to the university campus and
areas northeast of the university. To relieve the resulting overloading of
the outfall, several overflows have been added to this system during recent
years.
18.       During the last two decades, the area south of White Tower has be-
come very densely populated as a result of the construction of numerous apart-
ment buildings. This area, with an extension of about 850 ha is served by
combined sewers running perpendicular to the coast and discharging at the
shore into surface ocean waters. A similar system has been constructed by
the Municipality of Kalamaria at the southern end of the City. Both of these
systems have been constructed haphazardly to meet the needs of the growing
population and are, in many instances, of insufficient capacity.
19.       The northwestern sector of the City, further away from the coast,
lacks a defined sewer system. Some of the existing storm sewers have been
connected to the downtown system and pressed into service as combined sewers.
The main part of the storm sewer network discharges, however, into the
Dendropotamos river and through its entire length a large number of apart-
ment buildings and private dwellings have illegally connected their sewage
discharges and septic tank overflows.
20.       The Lagadas and Gallikos industrial zones discharge part of their
liquid waste into the municipal sewers and the rest into the Dendropotamos
and Gallikos rivers, respectively. The Esso industrial zone has some primary
treatment facilities and discharges directly into the inner Salonica Bay. The
new Axios industrial zone is discharging its raw wastes into the Axios river.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
21.       Sewer construction has been generally deficient.  In many instances,
inadequate slopes produce heavy grit sedimentation which requires continuous
sewer cleaning. Most of the smaller sewers were constructed of concrete and
vitrified clay pipes with cement mortar joints. Important seawater infiltra-
tion is, therefore, common in the sewers laid below sea level which serve the
coastal areas of the City. Finally, the insufficient capacity of the system
causes severe flooding of the lower areas during heavy rains.
22.       In spite of these unsatisfactory conditions, about 950 sewer connec-
tions have been added annually during recent years and it is estimated that a
population of about 463,000 is presently sewered. The rest of the population
is served by septic tanks, which are periodically emptied by privately owned
tank trucks. The number of septic tanks within the metropolitan area is
estimated at 40,000.
E.   Wastewater Characterization
23.       The results of tests of 24-hour composite samples taken in October
1975 at various points of the sewer system are summarized below:
Parameter                     Unit         Average              Range
BOD5                         mg/l             413             112 - 534
Suspended solids             mg/l             276              52 - 510
COD                          mg/l             778             300 - 1,110
Temperature                   OC              21.8           19.0 - 25.9
pH                                             8.1            7.5 - 8.4
Total nitrogen               mg/l             102              13 - 270
Total phosphorus             mg/l              20               5 - 35
Chlorides                    mg/l             171              78 - 305
The above tests indicate a strong sewage with extremely high nutrients con-
centrations and sporadic seawater infiltration.
Industrial Effluents Standards
24.       The Ministry of Social Services has adopted the following standards
for industrial effluents discharged into Salonica Bay:



ANNEX I
Page 6
Parameter                 Maximum permissible concentration
BOD5                                     30.mg/i
Suspended solids                         50 mg/l
Phenols                                  0.5 mg/l
Iron                                     30 mg/l
Mercury                                  0.05 mg/l

pH                                       6.5 - 8.5
25.       There are not tests available of the effluents of the two largest
industrial polluters (Macedonia Paper Company and Esso Pappas Petrochemical
Complex) but some industries were tested with the following results:
Water Consumption              BOD5        S.S.
Industry                              m3/day          pH        mg/i        mg/l
Sing - Chemicals                       3,888          2.6        -           546
Ethyl Hellas - Chemicals               1,380          6.8        170          13
Coca Cola                                -            9.7        460         169
Amstel - Brewery                          -            7.5       720         230
Good Year - Tires                        -            9.0        165          75
Amstel - Distillery                       -           5.7        780         318
Comparison of the figures above show that there is no compliance whatsoever
with the standards.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Existing Water Supply and Sewer Systems of Greater Volos
A.   Metropolitan Area
1.        Greater Volos is located in the region of Thessaly (eastern coast
of Central Greece) along the northern shore of the Pagasitikos Gulf and ranks
fourth in population among Greek cities. The metropolitan area covers three
municipalities, nine townships and an Industrial Estate as follows:
(a) The City itself on the northern shore of Volos Bay includes
the towns of Volos, Nea Ionia, Agia Paraskevi and Agios
Georgios.
(b) The village of Alykes on a narrow strip of land about 3.5 km
long and 200 to 500 m wide along the western shore of Volos
Bay.
(c) The township of Dimini and the village of Dimitrias located
in the hills above Alykes.
(d) The village of Melissatika and eight townships, known as the
l'mountain villages", located on the slopes of Mt. Pilion.
(e) The Industrial Estate located about 5 km west of the City.
2.        The total built-up area of Greater Volos covers about 1,600 ha. and
is expected to increase to about 2,300 ha. by the year 2015. Present popula-
tions are estimated at 82,600 for the City and at 97,300 for the entire metro-
politan area and by the year 2015 are expected to increase to 134,000 and
163,000, respectively.
3.        The Industrial Estate started operations in 1970 and houses today
19 industries: paper mill, foods, drugs, textiles, metal and glass products,
electrical appliances, etc. Within the City there are 57 smaller industries
including a distillery, a tannery, textiles, foods and beverages, dairies,
drugs, metallic and electrical appliances and building materials.
4.        During the summer, Volos attracts a considerable number of tourists,
and the metropolitan area has now about 2,000 hotel beds. In 1975, a peak of
6,000 summer daily visitors were recorded at the beaches of Alykes and Goritsa
(at the eastern shore of the City).



ANNEX 2
Page 2
B.   Water Supply System
5.        An important aquifer underlies the City; lesser aquifers underlie
Alykes and the valley east of the Industrial Estate and numerous springs flow
on the slopes of Mount Pilion so that the metropolitan population has always
had an abundant water supply.
6.        The Volos Municipal Water and Sewerage Authority (VMWSA) supplies
the Municipality of Volos which includes the towns of Volos, Agia Paraskevi,
Agios Georgios, Alykes and Dimitrias. This water supply system is composed
of:
Fourteen 90 - 130 m deep wells located in the NE part
of the City
Four reservoirs with a total storage capacity of 3,400 m3
150 km of water distribution pipes
21,726 house connections (at the end of 1974).
7.        During 1974, the VMWSA pumped a total of 3,193,000 m3 and sold
2,320,000 m3. An additional volume of 300,000 m3 was pumped from private
wells. Of the large unaccounted-for municipal water (27.3%), it is estimated
that 458,000 m3 (14.3%) correspond to losses in the system and the rest to
unmetered municipal uses such as standpipes, public laborartories, street
washing and sprinkling of parks.
8.        The Municipality of Nea Ionia serves only the town of Nea Ionia and
its water supply system- consists of:
Six 85 - 100 m deep wells located in the NW part of the City
Two reservoirs with a combined storage capacity of 900 m3
30 km of water distribution pipes
7,890 house connections (at the end of 1974).
9.        During 1974, the Municipality of Nea Ionia pumped a total of 981,000
m3 and sold 746,000 m3 of water so that the proportion of unaccounted-for
water (24%) is similar to the one recorded by the VMWSA.
10.       The village of Melissatika is supplied by a deep well and the "moun-
tain villages" by local springs but neither production nor sales of water are
metered.
11.       The Industrial Estate has a separate water supply composed of:



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Six 60 - 160 m deep wells located about 10 km west of the
Industrial Estate
Three reservoirs with a combined storage capacity of 3,100 m3
8 km steel transmission pipe line of 250 - 350 mm diameter
15 km of water distribution pipes.
During 1974, total water consumption was estimated at 400,000 m3 of which
280,000 m3 were provided by the above described system and the remaining
120,000 m3 from private wells.
12.       Undocumented deterioration in the quality of the water drawn from
the City wells during recent years has created the fear that the aquifer is
suffering contamination by sea water intrusion and by seepage from the num-
erous septic tanks and percolation pits. To reduce pumping from the City
wells, the VMWSA is completing installation of an 11-km transmission pipe-
line to the Kaliakouda Spring located NE of the City at El. + 860 m. Aver-
age and minimum yields of the Kaliakouda Spring are estimated at 23,000 and
8,000 m3/day respectively. The transmission line has been designed, however,
for a capacity fo 31,500 m3/day so that it can be extended in the future
to take also the waters from the Lagonika Spring, located 2 km further up-
hill at El. + 1,100 m. The VMWSA is also contemplating another water sup-
ply from the Koukourava Spring, located about 5 km NE of the City at El. +
320 m. Further investments in new water sources should, however, be delayed
until monitoring of chloride concentrations in the aquifer indicates the
amounts of water which can be drawn from the existing wells without causing
sea water intrusion.
13.       During 1974, domestic and commercial water consumption (including
that from private wells) within the service area amounted to 3,066,000 m3
and the population served to 75,200, that is, a unitary consumption of 112
lpcd. For the Industrial Estate the unitary water consumption in 1974 aver-
aged 5,000 m3/yr/ha.
C.   Existing Sewer System
14.       Wlithin the City only about 110 ha. of the coastal area, housing a
population of about 8,400 are presently sewered. The sewer system is composed
of:
8 km of old rectangular section combined sewers discharging
at the shore on surface waters
7 km of recently laid sanitary sewers discharging mostly
into the combined sewers
About 820 house connections.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
Most of the new sewers were poorly laid and only a few can be incorporated
into the proposed new sewer network.
15.       The rest of the City and all the adjacent villages and townships
are served by septic tanks and/or percolation pits. The septic tanks are
emptied periodically by privately-owned tank trucks which discharge the
septage into a sanitary landfill located about 3 km north of the City.
Average unitary cost for emptying the septic tanks is estimated today at
300 drachmas/capita/year.
16.       The area already developed of the Industrial Estate (160 ha) is
served by a recently constructed sewer network. This network, composed of
vitrified clay pipe of 200 - 300 mm diameter, has a total extension of
about 8 km and discharges raw sewage into the Xerias Creek, which flows
into the Volos Bay.
D.   Wastewater Characterization
17.       The results of tests of 24-hour composite samples taken during
September-October, 1975 at the outlets of the existing sewer system are sum-
marized below:
Parameter                   Unit             Average             Range
BOD5                        mg/l               347            236  -  490
pH                                                7.9         5.8  -  8.4
Temperature                 °C                  22             20  -  28
Total Solids                mg/l             1,351          1,018  -  1,898
Suspended Solids            mg/l               242            136  -  360
Settleable Solids           mg/l                12.8          6.0  -  19.0
Total Hardness              French 0            40.0         31.8  -  67.0
Alkalinity as CaCO3         mg/l                 10.4         4.9  -  32.0
Chlorides                   mg/l               276            145  -  702
Total Nitrogen              mg/l                72             12  -  135
Total Phosphorus            mg/l                18              2  -  46
COD                         mg/l               701            500  -  1,200
Fats                        mg/l                79             35  -  144
18.       The above tests show a strong sewage with unusually high concentra-
tion of nutrients and fats. Most of the existing domestic sewer connections
receive only septic tank overflows which explain the low suspended solid con-
centration. The large fluctuations in chloride concentration are very likely
due to sea water infiltration.
19.       The results of tests of composite samples taken at the outlets of
the main factories are summarized in Attachment 1. The tests did not include
determination of heavy metals which are likely to be present in rather high
concentrations in the effluents of the Leventeris and Kappas factories.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Description of the Greater Salonica Sewerage Program
A.   General
1.        Because of its topography the Greater Salonica metropolitan area
will be sewered by two separate systems, as follows:
(i) The Axios system, which will serve the City of Salonica itself
and all the existing industrial zones and will discharge into
the Axios River.
(ii) The Mega Emvolon system which will serve the southeastern sector
of the metropolitan area and will discharge into the Thermaikos
Gulf through a submarine outfall.
The long-range sewer program contemplates the entire construction of both
systems.
2.        The proposed Bank-financed project, to be developed during the
period 1977-1981, includes the first construction stage of the Axios system,
partial rehabilitation of the existing sewer network and a complete feas-
ibility study for the Mega Emvolon system. The first stage of the Axios
system includes the sewers needed to intercept the wastewaters presently
being discharged into Salonica Bay and the inland water courses; the main
interceptor to carry the wastewaters to the Axios River, a primary treatment
plant on the eastern bank of the Axios and some extensions and replacements
of the sewer network. Upon completion of the 1977-1981 project, the sewer
program calls for the construction of the Mega Emvolon system, and the con-
tinuous expansion of both systems to cover the entire metropolitan area.
B.   The Project (1977-1981)
3.        The first construction stage of the Axios system, under consider-
ation for Bank financing, includes the following structure:
(i) Existing Sewer Network: Rehabilitation, extension and rein-
forcement of the sewer networks presently serving the coastal
downtown area of the City, as follows:



ANNEX 3
Page 2
54.8 km of secondary sewers
9.2 km of trunk mains
1.6 km of force mains
3 pumping stations with initial capacities of
44, 74 and 109 lps respectively.
(ii) Sewer network expansions: Construction of sewer networks in
the Lagadas and Esso industrial zones, as follows:
10.2 km of secondary sewers
6.2 km of trunk mains.
(iii) Coastal interceptors: To intercept the trunk mains presently
discharging into the inner Salonica Bay and to pump their
flows into the main interceptor, as follows:
8 km of gravity interceptors of 400 to 1,200 mm
diameter
1.1 km of force mains
3 pumping stations with initial capacities of
240, 735 and 1,190 lps respectively.
(iv) Main interceptors: Construction of the lower part of the
main interceptor, between the White Tower area and the Axios
River, as follows:
25.4 km of gravity pipeline of 2.10 to 2.90 m
diameter
(v) Primary treatment plant: Constructed on the eastern bank
of the Axios River for a first stage design capacity of:
Average flow               =  3.9 m3/sec
Peak flow                     4.6 m3/sec
Suspended solids loading  =  81.6 ton/day
Only physico-chemical treatment is considered viable at this
stage, since existing industries are presently discharging
toxic substances in concentrations likely to inhibit biological
processes. The liquid phase of the plant would incorporate:
Low lift pumping station equipped with screw pumps
Parshall flume equipped with flow recorder
Mechanically cleaned bar screens
Aerated grit chambers equipped with grit washer
Primary clarifiers equipped with mechanical sludge
and scum removal facilities
Feeders for the addition of coagulants - chemical
coagulation would be used only when the flow of
the Axios River becomes insufficient to provide
adequate dilution of the plant effluent.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
For the solid phase, two alternatives are to be considered as follows:
Alternative I
Gravity sludge thickeners
Water heated anaerobic digesters
Sludge ponds equipped with facilities for super-
natant disposal by percolation.
Alternative II
Sludge dewatering by vacuum or pressure filtration
Sludge incineration by multiple hearth furnaces.
C.   Mega Emvolon Sewer Project
4.        The Bank-financed project will also include a full feasibility
study for the Mega Emvolon sewer system. This study is expected to become
a pilot for Greece on wastewater reclamation for irrigation purposes.
5.        The Cape of Mega Emvolon contains a combination of conditions which
are fairly common in Greece:
(i) Need to protect ocean beaches of considerable touristic
potential; and
(ii) Need to provide seasonal irrigation of agricultural lands
adjacent to the ocean.
Development of sewer projects which allow the use of wastewater effluent for
seasonal irrigation is, therefore, of country-wide interest.
6.        For the Mega Emvolon system, the consultants have indicated the
possibility of using activated sludge treatment plant with an extended
aeration configuration. For technical and economical reasons, the proposed
review will also examine the possibility of using mechanically aerated ponds.
D.   Rehabilitation of the Existing Sewer System
7.        The Salonica Sewer Authority is acquiring equipment for sewer clean-
ing and has already initiated a program for mapping the existing sewer network.
To supplement this program the Bank-financed project includes the acquisition
of a television equipped van, smoke bombs and other related equipment for
internal sewer inspection.
8.        The purposes of the sewer rehabilitation program are threefold:
(i) To provide the data for designing the needed reinforcements
of the existing sewer network;



ANNEX 3
Page 4
(ii) To initiate the separation of the present combined system
by locating and sealing the existing stormwater inlets;
(iii) To rehabilitate, whenever possible, existing sewers by in-
stallation of cement mortar or plastic pipe linings.
E.   1982-1985 Construction Program
9.        It covers the construction of the first stage of the Mega Emvolon
sewer system and extensions of the Axios system and includes the following
structures:
Mega Emvolon System
(i) Secondary sewer network:
15.7 km of secondary sewers
3.8 km of trunk mains
1.0 km of force mains
3 pumping stations
(ii) Main interceptor:
9.3 km of gravity mains
1.0 km of force mains
2 pumping stations
(iii)   Treatment plant:
Secondary treatment plant for a maximum day flow
capacity of 12,000 m3/day.
(iv) Ocean outfall:
800 m of 600 mm pipe
Axios System
(v) Sewer network extensions and replacements:
167 km of secondary sewers
16.8 km of trunk mains
(vi) Dendropotamos interceptors:
15.9 km of gravity interceptors.

Description of the Greater Volos Sewerage Program
A.   General
1.        The long-range sewer program covers the construction of the entire
sewer system for metropolitan Volos and the adjacent Industrial Estate, in-
cluding the collection system, joint treatment of the domestic and industrial
wastewaters and final effluent disposal into the Pagasitikos Gulf through
a submarine outfall.
2.        The first stage of the sewer program, to be constructed during the
period 1977-1980, includes the infrastructure to serve the projected popula-
tion up to 1995, pretreatment of the wastewaters, and all the secondary sewer
networks which can logistically be installed during that 4-year span. A con-
tinuous program of extensions of the sewer network is proposed for the
period 1981-1990, and a second major construction stage is likely during the
period 1991-1995. The second stage would increase the capacity of the infra-
structure to serve the estimated population for the year 2015 and would also
upgrade the treatment facilities, as required, to prevent deterioration in
the water quality of the Pagasitikos Gulf. However, topography and low
population densities preclude economical sewering of the mountain villages
within the foreseeable future so it is intended that during this century
these villages will continue to depend on septic tanks.
B.   The Project
3.        The first stage structures, to be constructed under the Bank-
financed project, are detailed below:
(i) Sewer network - town area: It will serve an area of about
485 ha and will be integrated by:
104.0 km of secondary sewers
10.8 km of trunk mains
0.6 km of force mains
2 pumping stations designed for first stage peak
flow capacities of 72 and 88 lps respectively.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(ii) Sewer network - Alykes Beach: It will serve an area of
about 26 ha and will be integrated by:
5.0 km of secondary se-s
0,9 ili of force mains
2 pumping stations designed for first stage peak
flow capacities of 8 and 15 lps respectively.
(iii) Sewer network - Industrial Estate: It will serve an area
of about 40 ha through the installation of about 4.0 km of
secondary sewers.
(iv)  Main pumping station and force main:  It will pump all the
sewage of the town area to the treatment plant.
Pumping station equipped with vertical, two-speed
pumps designed for an initial flow of 470 lps
1.9 km of 700 mm diameter force main.
(v) Industrial Estate collector: It will carry all the waste-
waters from the Industrial Estate to the treatment plant,
and in the future will also serve the village of Dimini.
1.0 km of 500 mm diameter gravity sewer
2.9 km of 800 mm diameter gravity sewer
(vi) Treatment Plant: The pretreatment plant will be designed
for a first stage peak flow of 1 m3/sec and will include
the following structures:
1 Parshall flume equipped with in-stream flow recorder
2 mechanically cleaned bar screens
2 aerated grit chambers equipped with grit washer
2 air flotation tanks equipped with sludge holding tank.
The plant site allows future construction of primary clarifiers,
sludge digesters and flow equalization ponds.
(vii) Effluent pumping station: It will be a temporary above-ground
structure located at the outlet of the treatment plant. Con-
struction of a permanent structure will be postponed until
the second stage (1991-1995) so that it can conform with the
upgrading of the treatment facilities to be conducted at that
time. The station will be equipped with two-speed pumps and
will have an initial capacity of about 740 lps.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(viii) Main Interceptor: It will carry the plant effluent to Cape Agistri
7.7 km of 800 mm diameter force main
0.4 km of 800 mm diameter gravity main
(ix) Ocean outfall: It will be located at Cape Agistri, will be
designed to provide a minimum initial dilution of 1/100, and
will reach depths of about 45 m below sea level.
450 m of 800 mm diameter submarine outfall
240 m of diffuser pipe provided with about 30
outlet ports.
C.   Sewer Network Expansion (1981-1990)
4.        The proposed extensions of the secondary sewer network to be carried
out during the period 1981-1990 are tabulated below:

5.        Installation of additional pumps in the Main and Effluent Pumping
Stations are also proposed for 1986 to increase their capacities to 625 and
950 lps, respectively.
D.   Second Stage (1991-1995)
6.        The structure proposed for the second construction stage are
enumerated below:
(i) Sewer networks
20.7 km of second sewers
3.5 km of trunk mains
1.6 km of force mains
Addition of pumps at the two Alykes pumping stations
to increase their capacities to 33 and 56 lps, respec-
tively.
One pumping station at Dimitrias with a 72 lps capacity.
(ii) Main pumping station and force main:
Double barrelling of the 1.9 km force main using 500 mm diameter
pipe. By reducing friction losses the double barrelling would
increase the pumping station capacity to 830 lps.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(iii) Treatment Plant
Increase of the pretreatment facilities capacity to 1.5
m3/sec through the addition of:
1 mechanically cleaned bar screen
2 air flotation tanks.
Upgrading of the treatment facilities as required by the
results of the monitoring of the Pagasitikos Gulf.
(iv)  Effluent pumping station
Flow equalization ponds equipped with floating aerators
of sufficient capacity to maintain the solids in suspension
and to prevent septicity.
Replacement of the temporary pumping station by a permanent
structure.
(v)  Main Interceptor and Ocean outfall
No changes are contemplated since the equalization ponds
should allow the larger second-stage flows without double
barrelling the main interceptor and ocean outfalls.

2.        The reduction of the country's demographic growth during the period
1961-1971 was due mainly to a large emigration of mostly rural population to
the labor markets of Western Europe and the Americas.  The emigration reached
its peak in 1969 and since then it has declined rapidly, being negligible dur-
ing the last three years. However, the natural demographic growth (births
minus deaths) also declined steadily during the 1960's, but it has stabilized
at about 0.7% per year during the first part of the present decade.

C.   Population Projections
5.        The Government has commissioned several studies of the future growth
of Greater Salonica. Even though these studies are based on different develop-
ment policies, their predictions cover an unusually wide range showing the
incertitudes in forecasting future population from existing historical data.
For the Sewerage Master Plan, the consultants adopted the demographic growth
curve proposed in 1968 by Professor J.D. Triandafillidis shown on Attachment 1.
A comparison of population forecasts for various design horizons follows:
Estimated Future Population (000)
Year         Triandafillidis Curve       Forecasting Range
1980                   777                  640 -   860
1990                   957                  750 - 1,250
2000                 1,128                  880 - 1,750
D.   Projections of Service Levels and Water Consumptions
6.        Projections of populations supplied with water and of sewered popu-
lations were made by the consultants on the basis of present programs of water
supply and sewerage construction.
7.        Water consumptions in premises connected to the sewer system and in
the entire metropolitan area were projected by the mission using the following
assumptions:
(a) Domestic water consumption - per capita consumptions from
106 lpcd in 1974 to 150 lpcd in 1990.
(b) Industrial water consumptions - unitary consumptions from
9,500 m3/ha/yr in 1974 to 13,500 m3/ha/yr in 1990.
The resulting curves are also included in Attachment 1.

Greater Volos - Projections of Population,
Levels of Service and Water Consumption
A.   Past Demographic Growth
1.        Census population for the city of Volos, itself, and for the entire
Greater Volos metropolitan area are tabulated below:
City of Volos                          Greater Voles
Year    Population  Mean Annual Growth - %   Population  Mean Annual Growth -%

1971      77,485                                  90,851
B.   Projection of Population, Levels of Service and Water Sales
2.        The populations predicted in the various studies of the future growth
of Greater Volos are quite consistent so that the sewerage master plan consul-
tants found the well accepted curve of future growth which is shown graphically
in Attachment 1.
3.        Projections of the population to be connected to the water supply
system were made by the consultants in accordance with the proposed schedule
for take-over of the existing water supply systems by the new Volos Water and
Sewerage Organisation (VWSO). Projections of sewered population were made by
the consultants on the basis of the proposed program of sewerage construction.
4.        Water sales by the VWSO in the entire metropolitan area and in the
premises connected to the sewerage system were made by the mission using the
following coefficients:



ANNEX 6

(a) Domestic consumption - per capita consumptions from 116 lpcd
in 1976 to 144 lpcd in 1990.
(b) Industrial consumption - unitary consumptions from 6,000
m3/ha/yr in 1976 to 10,000 m3/ha/yr in 1990.
Projected levels of service and water sales are also included in Attachment 1.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Accounting, Financial Control and Tariff Studies
Tentative Terms of Reference
A.   Introduction
1.        The Ministry of Public Works and local sewerage authorities are pre-
paring long-range regional sewerage projects to serve the metropolitan areas
of Salonica and Volos. The Salonica project is being planned on the basis of
a joint primary treatment of industrial and municipal wastewaters followed by
disposal into the Axios River and contemplates a possible second construction
stage upgrading the primary plant to secondary biological treatment. The
Volos project is based on the joint discharge of raw industrial and municipal
wastewaters into the Pagasitikos Gulf through an ocean outfall off Agistri
Cape and contemplates the future addition of treatment facilities.
2.        The Government has established an autonomous sewerage authority for
the metropolitan area of Salonica (SSA). It proposes to extend the jurisdic-
tion of the authority to include new industrial estates and other areas
intended to be served by the new sewer system. There is a separate water
authority for the metropolitan area of Salonica (SWA) and it is the intention
of the Government that the water and sewerage authorities combine, to operate
under a common management, as soon as this seems appropriate. It is, however,
expected, that for the time being, the two authorities will continue to
operate separately. Water consumers connected to the wastewater system will
be billed by the water authority for wastewater charges and the proceeds (less
an allowance for collection costs) will be handed over the SSA.
3.        The Government intends to establish, during 1977, an autonomous
water and sewerage authority for the metropolitan area of Volos (VWSO). Such
an authority already exists for the municipality of Volos, but does not cover
other areas. However, the present authority provides certain water services
to areas outside its jurisdictional boundaries (e.g. Industrial areas and
Dimini) on an agency basis.
4.        The present systems of accounting and financial control used by
the water and sewer authorities are based on civil service procedures and, as
such, are unsuitable for autonomous organizations. Accounts are kept on a
cash receipts and payments basis following budget headings prescribed by the
Government (either by administrative direction or by legislation or regulation).



ANNEX 7
Page 2
The lack of an appropriate accounting and reporting system allows certain
weaknesses in internal financial control which cannot be corrected by other
systems of control imposed from outside.
5.        In each city, at present, water tariffs are based on a single
flat-rate unit charge, but with various discounts to different categories of
consumer. In addition, certain public buildings and other premises are sup-
plied free. Following its decision to establish water and sewerage authori-
ties on a more autonomous and financially independent basis, and in view of
growing water shortages in many areas, the Government is considering whether
these present tariff structures are any longer appropriate.
6.        The Government wishes to establish modern systems of accounting,
reporting, financial control and tariff structures in the water and sewer
authorities of Salonica and Volos, such systems to be appropriate to the work
of these authorities as financially autonomous organizations. The Government
therefore proposes to seek the assistance of suitably qualified financial and
accounting consultants to review present arrangements, to make appropriate
recommendations and to assist in the implementation of these recommendations,
after approval by the Government.
7.        The Government has requested a loan from the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development for partial financing of the construction of
the sewerage system of Salonica and Volos and it is intended that part of the
proceeds from this loan be applied towards foreign exchange payments (if any)
for the consultants' services.
8.        It is expected that the work of the consultants will be conducted in
both cities simultaneously and that the initial work of review and implementa-
tion will be completed within a period of twelve months, beginning in the first
half of 1977. It is expected that follow-up arrangements may be necessary for
a further period of 12-18 months.
9.        The Government has a program for the construction of water and
sewerage works in other cities of Greece and contemplates the establishment
of appropriate authorities for the management thereof, along similar princi-
ples to those to be developed in Salonica and Volos. It is therefore expected
that the systems of accounting, financial control and tariffs established in
Salonica and Volos will serve as models for these other cities in due course.
B.   Qualifications of Consultants
10.       It is expected that the consultants will be a reputable and expe-
rienced firm of professional accountants with international standing. It will
be necessary for the majority of personnel employed on the assignment to have
a thorough knowledge of conditions in Greece, and to speak, read and write
fluently in Greek. It is anticipated that the assignment would most likely be
carried out either:
(a) by an international firm of accountants with a permanent
office established in Greece and employing Greek staff; or
(b) by a Greek firm of accountants working in association with
a reputable international firm.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
C.   Objectives
11.       In relation to accounting and financial control systems, the initial
objectives of the assignment will be as follows:
(a)  to review the present systems of accounting and financial
control employed by the Salonica Water Authority, the
Salonica Sewer Authority and the Volos Water and Sewer
Authority;
(b)  to assist the authorities in the development of the neces-
sary changes for the establishment of accounting systems
based on full commercial principles, including but not
limited to:
(i)  full accounting for fixed assets and for depreciation
charges related thereto;
(ii) matching of periodical income and expenditures during
the periods of their incurrence;
(iii)  accrual qf current assets and current liabilities,
including accounts payable and receivable;
(iv) full accounting for inventories and for light tools
and equipment on the basis of both quantity and value;
(v)  accounting for loans and other long-term liabilities;
and
(vi) preparation and presentation of periodical financial
statements for management and for external publication
as appropriate.
(c)  to develop appropriate systems of billing, cash collection and
disbursement, and analysis of income and expenditure;
(d)  to develop systems of internal financial control consistent
with accounting systems referred to in (b) and (c), and fol-
lowing principles outlined in Attachment 1;
(e)  to examine systems of external financial control to determine
the extent to which these could be modified or eliminated;
(f)  to examine legislation and other regulations of Government
regarding accounting procedures, budgetary requirements and
financial control to determine the extent to which these
should be modified to more effectively permit the overall
objectives of the assignment; and



ANNEX 7
Page 4
(g) to report recommendations to the appropriate department of
Government on all matters covered by the review.
12.       In relation to tariff systems, the initial objectives of the as-
signment will be as follows:
(a)  to review the present water tariff structures, and related sewer
tariff structures of the Salonica Water Authority, the Salonica
Sewer Authority and the Volos Water and Sewer Authority; and
(b)  to assist the authorities, and the government, in formulating
proposals for changes in the various tariff structures, having
regard to a reasonable balance among the following needs:
(i)  payment by consumers of economic costs of providing
supplies and services;
(ii) operation of each authority on a financially auton-
omous basis;
(iii) conservation of water and rational use thereof (with
particular reference to industrial use); ?
(iv) deterence from uneconomic and irrational use of sewer
facilities (with particular reference to industrial
use);
(v)  provision of a basic minimum supply at a price which
does not unduly burden low-income consumers;
(vi) elimination of free supplies, other than in exceptional
circumstances; and
(vii) efficiency and economy of billing and collection.
13.       Following the approval of the recommendations by Government in con-
sultation, as necessary, with the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the consultant would be expected to:
(a)  assist in the design of the necessary accounting systems in
detail;
(b)  assist in the implementation of the systems of accounting and
financial control in the various authorities concerned;
(c)  give guidance to and, where necessary, train the staff of the
authorities in the implementaion of the systems; and
(d)  for a limited period, provide follow-up from time to time to
ensure that the systems are operating in a satisfactory manner.



ANNEX 7
Page 5
14.       The recommendations on systems to be implemented in Salonica should
have regard to the intended eventual merger of the water and sewer authorities
under a single management. Present indications are that technical considera-
tions related to construction and operation of the physical systems will pre-
clude the full integration of the two authorities until after the wastewater
project has been completed. However, recommendations can include proposals
for joint co-operation between the two authorities on the establishment of a
common accounting service, no earlier than January 1978, if this seems to be
appropriate.
15.       In the interests of economy and also to minimise disruptions result-
ing from proposed re-organizations, the recommendations of the consultant
should consider the extent to which presently operating accounting arrange-
ments could be integrated (with necessary modifications) into any new propo-
sals. This might apply, for example, to the billing systems presently
operational in both cities, and possibly to some of the procedures for the
ordering and payment of goods and services.

6.   No involvement of members of the managing board in the day to day adminis-
tration of the authority. The board should determine policy (and approve
of plans and budgets) but leave all administration to the general manager.

Accounting and Financial Consultants
Suggested Outline of Evaluation of Proposals
and Arrangements for Contracting
1.        Selection of consultants should follow the procedures outlined in
the World Bank Group publication "Uses of Consultants by the World Bank and
Its Borrowers."
2.        Proposals should be invited by the Government from a selection of
approprate firms, based on Section B of the draft terms of reference "QUALI-
FICATIONS OF CONSULTANTS."
3.        The Government should evaluate the proposals without reference to
fees to be charged and the consultants should be requested not to quote fees
in their proposals.
4.        After evaluation, but before opening negotiations with the firm
selected, the proposals, and the Government's observations thereon, should
be forwarded to the Bank for its review and concurrence.
NOTE: The Bank does not seek to approve the Government's
proposals but wishes to have the opportunity to raise
objections where the acceptance of proposals might not be
in the best interests of the project.
5.        In the event that the Bank raises no objections to the proposed
selection, negotiations should be opened with the intended consultant on
fees and expenses for completion of the work outlined in paragraph 10 of the
draft terms of reference (i.e. review and reporting). It is suggested that
no commitment be entered into, at this stage, for the work outlined in
paragraph 11 of the draft terms of reference (i.e. detailed design and imple-
mentation) for which expenses will be difficult to estimate until the review
and reporting process has been completed. Furthermore, the Government should
retain the option to employ, if necessary, a different firm for the imple-
mentation stage.



ANNEX 7
Attachment 2
Page 8
6.        In the event that agreement cannot be reached on a contract with
the first choice of consultant, the Government should negotiate with the
consultant submitting the next most suitable proposal. This process should
continue until agreement is reached between Government and a satisfactory
consultant.
7.        The consultant with whom the Government proposes to contract should
provide the Government, before concluding such contract, with a schedule of
personnel to be employed on the studies; details of each person's qualifica-
tions and experience; the periods of employment of such personnel; and the
rates for their services specified in man-month and man-day rates. In addi-
tion, the consultant should specify the costs of additional services he pro-
poses to utilize and give an estimate of likely foreign exchange costs. The
consultant should be required to undertake not to withdraw personnel who have
been approved by Government without the prior agreement of the Government.
8.        When the report has been received on the first stage of work, it
should be reviewed by the Government, in consultation with the World Bank.
After such review, a decision should be taken by the Government as to the
selection of consultants for the design and implementation stage.
9.        The proposed studies are likely to recommend considerable changes in
long-standing procedures, both in the Government and in the autonomous organi-
zations concerned. The implementation, training, and follow-up procedures
are therefore of considerable importance and the selection of the consultants
should pay regard to their ability and experience in combining firmness and
integrity of proposals with tact and understanding in their implementation.

Review of the Feasiblity Studies for the Mega Emvolon Sewerage System
Tentative Terms of Reference
A.   Introduction
1.        In 1969 the consulting firm THESMEA prepared for the Ministry of
Public Works a feasibility study of the sewer system of Greater Salonica.
This study, which was updated in 1975 by the firm OTME Hydraulic Projects Ltd.
proposed to sewer the Salonica metropolitan area by two separate sewer systems:
(a) the Axios system which would serve all the industrial zones
and most of the present urban area and would discharge into
the Axios River; and
(b) the Mega Emvolon system which would serve the southeastern
part of the metropolitan area and would discharge into the
sea through a submarine outfall.
2.        The Ministry of Public Works has already approved the feasibility
study for the Axios system and the population and sewage flow projections
for the Mega Emvolon system but desires to retain the services of consultants
to review the wastewater treatment and disposal procedures proposed by the
previous consultants for the Mega Emvolon system. This review shall be based
on the oceanographic survey which the Institute for Oceanographic and Fishing
Research (IOKAE) is presently conducting on the sea around the Cape of Mega
Emvolon.
3.        It is intended that this review will be conducted by a competent
local engineering firm associated with an appropriately experienced foreign
firm and that maximum use will be made of local manpower, resources and
skills. The consultants will work under the direction of the Ministry of
Public Works.
4.        The Government of Greece has requested a loan from the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development for partial financing of sewerage
development, including the first stage construction of the Axios sewer system.
It is intended that part of the proceeds from the loan would be applied to-
wards the foreign exchange payments for the consultant's services.



ANNEX 8
Page 2
B.   Background
5.        Preliminary oceanographic studies carried out by IOKAE in 1975
showed that the sea around Mega Emvolon Cape is shallow, that at least during
the summer there is a strong thermal stratification, and that the main ocean
currents are wind-induced. It is anticipated, therefore, that the treatment
will have to provide high degree of removal of bacteria, suspended solids
and BOD.
6.        On and adjacent to the Cape of Mega Emvolon there are extensive
areas of cultivated land which lack sufficient irrigation water during part
of the year so that the Ministry of Public Works is interested in the possible
use of the treatment plant effluent for seasonal irrigation. The Ministry
also desires to develop local expertise on wastewater reclamation and intends
that the Mega Emvolon project becomes, if possible, a pilot project on the use
of wastewater effluent for irrigation.
C.   Objectives
7.        The main objective of this review is to find the least cost process
for wastewater treatment and disposal which provides adequate protection of
the bathing beaches of Agia Trias and Nei Epivate and of the shellfish beds
around the Cape of Mega Emvolon. The secondary objective is to determine the
possibility of using the effluent for seasonal crop irrigation.
D.   Scope
8.        The work to be carried out by the consultants will include:
(a) Establishment of effluent quality criteria for: (i) ocean
disposal, and (ii) irrigation of various types of crops.
(b) Determination of the degree of treatment required for both,
ocean disposal and irrigation, at the two alternative outfall
locations proposed by the previous consultants as well as for
any other outfall location the consultants consider advisable.
(c) Selection of treatment processes. The main selection criteria
will be simplicity and reliability of plant operation and
back-up safety in case of malfunction of one of the plant
components.
(d) Estimates of construction and operation costs (treatment
and outfall) of the above alternatives and of the economic
benefits derived from irrigation. Calculation of present
values of various cash flow streams using suitable discount
rates.
(e) Specific recommendations regarding effluent monitoring and
quality control of the treatment, disposal and reclamation
operations for both ocean disposal and irrigation.

Industrial Wastewater Surveys in Salonica and Volos
Tentative Terms of Reference
A.   Introduction
1.        The Government of Greece intends to retain the services of consul-
tants to conduct industrial wastewater surveys in Salonica and Volos.
2.        At present the Ministry of Public Works and the local sewerage
authorities are preparing long-range regional sewerage programs to serve the
metropolitan areas of Salonica and Volos. The first construction stage for
Salonica is being planned on the basis of joint primary treatment of indus-
trial and municipal wastewaters followed by disposal into the Axios River, a
short distance upstream from its discharge into the Thermaikos Gulf. For
Volos the first construction stage contemplates joint discharge of raw indus-
trial and municipal wastewaters into the Pagasitikos Gulf through an ocean
outfall off Agistri Cape. In both cases, the treatment facilities will be
upgraded later, if necessary, for preventing deterioration in the quality of
the receiving waters.
3.        The Institute for Oceanographic and Fishing Research (IOKAE) is
carrying out oceanographic studies of the Thermaikos and Pagasitikos Gulfs,
and will conduct periodic monitoring of their waters once the proposed treat-
ment and disposal facilities enter into operation. The industrial wastewater
surveys should conform to these oceanographic studies as well as to the ongoing
projects outlined in paragraph 2 above.
4.        It is intended that the industrial wastewater surveys be conducted
by a competent local engineering firm associated with an experienced foreign
engineering firm so as to allow maximum utilization of local manpower, re-
sources and skills.
5.        The consultants will work under the direction of the Ministry of
Public Works, which will seek the cooperation of industry to provide the
information needed and allow the inspections, measurements and testing
required.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
6.        The Government of Greece has requested a loan from the Interna-
tional Bank for Reconstruction and Development for partial financing of the
first construction stage of the Salonica and Volos sewer systems and it is
intended that part of the proceeds from this loan be applied towards the
foreign exchange payments for the consultant's services.
7.        It is expected that the industrial wastewater surveys be conducted
simultaneously for both cities and that they be completed during a period
not to exceed 18 months.
B.   Objectives
8.        The objectives of the industrial wastewater surveys are threefold:
(a) To provide the data on present and estimated future flows and
characteristics of industrial wastewaters needed for designing
the treatment and disposal facilities, and establishing the
ocean monitoring program.
(b) To provide specific information on the toxics 1/ and incom-
patible pollutants 2/ which industry should remove from their
liquid wastes prior to their discharge into the municipal
sewers or to public land or water bodies, and to establish
a time frame for removal and the degree of removal required.
(c) To assist the local sewerage authorities in establishing pro-
grams for monitoring industrial wastewater effluents and in
the determination of appropriate industrial wastewater charges.
C.   Scope
9.        The work to be conducted by the consultants will include:
(a) Preparation of a list of major contributing industries 3/ in-
dicating the type and characteristics of each industry; sources,
volumes and main flow fluctuations of process and cooling waters,
strength of wastewaters, description of existing pretreatment
facilities and possibility of accidental spillage of strong wastes.
1/   Toxics - substances which are-present in concentrations that are
considered to be a threat to life processes.
2/   Incompatible Pollutants - substances which cannot be handled or will
interfere with the proposed treatment and/or disposal procedure. For
example, substances which will inhibit biological processes if a
biological treatment plant is chosen.
3/   Major contributing industry is one that:  (a) has a wastewater flow
of 200 m3 or more per average work day or (b) has in its waste pollu-
tant concentrations which require special consideration during the
design of collection, treatment and/or disposal facilities.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
(b) Preparation of a list of the industries which are discharging
or could discharge toxics and/or incompatible pollutants, in-
dicating the present average and maximum concentrations of
such substances and the degree of removal required.
(c) Preparation of material flow sheets for the entire production
process of each one of the potential polluters found from the
above surveys. The flow sheets will indicate the amounts of
raw materials, additives, end products, by-products and liquid
and solid wastes so as to present an accurate mass balance of
each production process. The flow sheets will also include
wastewater flows and characteristics for each operation of
the factory and indicate if the flows are continuous or
intermittent and if there are seasonal fluctuations. The
waste characterization should identify all important physico-
chemical and biological parameters, that is, those in high
concentrations or liable to reach toxic levels.
(d) Based on the flow sheets indicated above, economic comparison
of inplant measures which may be taken by industry to eliminate
or reduce toxics, incompatible pollutants or compatible pollu-
tants in high concentrations. These measures should include
the use of non-polluting raw materials, process modifications,
recovery and separate disposal of pollutants, pretreatment at
factory site, etc.
(e) Estimates of present and future flows and pollutant loadings
of industrial wastewaters for each city, including minimum,
average and peak flows and loadings. Combining these figures
with those to be provided by the Ministry of Public Works for
municipal wastewaters, suggestions will be made on the type
and degree of treatment for the proposed municipal treatment
plants.
(f) Detailed recommendations for establishing a program for
monitoring industrial discharges, including staff and equip-
ment required, points and frequency of measurement and sampling
and parameters to be monitored.
(g) Recommendations on the tarifs which should be established by
the local sewerage authorities for the collection, treatment
and disposal of industrial wastewaters.



ANNEX 9
Page 4
(h) Recommendations for establishing and subsequent upgrading of
wastewater discharge guidelines and suggestions regarding the
measures which should be adopted by Government for enforcing
such guidelines and time frames for compliance. The initial
guidelines, which will be implemented before the first con-
struction stage enters operation, will be aimed to protect
the collection system and the primary treatment facilities
and to prevent toxicity in the receiving waters. These guide-
lines will be later modified in accordance with the results of
the ocean monitoring and of any upgrading of the treatment
processes.

Oceanographic Studies in the Thermaikos and Pagasitikos Gulfs
Tentative Terms of Reference
A.   Background
1.        During the summer of 1975 the Institute for Oceanographic and Fishing
Research (IOKAE) carried out two cruises on the Thermaikos and Pagasitikos
Gulfs to determine the main oceanographic parameters required for the prelim-
inary design of the Salonica and Volos sewer projects.
2.        Based on the data obtained during these cruises and on feasibility
studies conducted by engineering consultants, the Ministry of Public Works has
adopted the following wastewater disposal and treatment procedures:
(a) Salonica - Joint discharge of municipal and industrial waste-
waters into the Axios River. Primary treatment will be
provided during first-stage construction.
(b) Volos - Joint discharge of municipal and industrial waste-
waters into the Pagasitikos Gulf through a submarine outfall
off Agistri Cape. Only pretreatment will be provided during
first-stage construction.
In either case, the treatment facilities would be upgraded later should the
subsequent ocean monitoring indicate deterioration in the water quality of
the Thermaikos Gulf and/or Pagasitikos Gulf.
3.        The Ministry of Public Works intends now to proceed with the final
design and construction of the first-stage facilities outlined above.
B.   Objectives
4.        IOKAE will conduct additional studies of the Thermaikos and
Pagasitikos Gulfs with the following objectives:
(a) to obtain the oceanographic data required for the final
design and construction of the first-stage treatment and
disposal facilities for Volos;



ANNEX 10
Page 2
(b) to obtain the oceanographic data required for the feasi-
bility studies and design of the Mega Emvolon sewer system
which would serve the urban area of Greater Salonica south
of Micra airport;
(c) to determine baseline conditions and dispersion patterns
for monitoring the receiving waters once the disposal facil-
ities enter into operation;
(d) to begin development of mathematical models of the Thermaikos
Gulf for projecting water quality conditions under alterna-
tive waste loadings.
C.   Scope
5.        Determination of design data for the Volos submarine outfall at
Cape Agistri:
(a) bathymetric survey and topographic mapping of the outfall area;
(b) subsoil profile (to a depth of at least three meters) of the
outfall alignment by borings plus seismic bottom profiling
or jet probings.
6.        Determination of design data for the Mega Emvolon disposal system:
(a) Measurements of water temperatures, salinities and surface and
bottom ocean currents in the sea around Mega Emvolon Cape.
(b) Fluctuations on the depth and thickness of the thermocline
during various times of the year in the sea around Mega Emvolon
Cape.
(c) Bathymetric surveys of the areas selected by the consultants
for submarine outfall construction.
(d) Sub-soil profiling along the axis of the outfall alignments
proposed by the consultants.
7.        Determination of baseline conditions for future monitoring includ-
ing the following parameters:
(a) physical oceanography: meteorology and physical constants
(salinity, transparency, etc.);
(b) geological oceanography: transport and deposition of sediments;
(c) biological oceanography: benthos, phytoplankton, zooplankton,
fisheries, microbiology and fish diseases;



ANNEX 10
Page 3
(d) chemical oceanography: standard determinations (dissolved
oxygen, nutrients, ammonia, etc.), trace metals in water,
sediments and animals, chlorinated hydrocarbons in animals;
(e) inventories of fish and shell fish population, physiology
and movements in the Thermaikos and Pagasitikos Gulfs.
8.        Determination of dispersion patterns at the site where the Axios
River flows into the Thermaikos Gulf and at the Agistri outfall area:
(a) establishment of variations on the depth and characteristics
of the thermocline throughout the year;
(b) establishment of fluctuations of bottom and surface ocean
currents and their relationship with tides and winds;
(c) establishment of the dispersion areas by salinity measure-
ments and fluorescent dyes.
9.        Development of a simplified mathematical model for the area where
the Axios River waters disperse into the Thermaikos Gulf. A linear model
should be developed and verified by field measurements. The model should
serve to project physical, chemical and dissolved oxygen conditions in re-
sponse to alternative waste loadings.

ANNEX 15
Page 1
APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Organization and Administration of Responsible Authorities
Water and Sewerage Authorities
1.        In general, Greek law provides for water and sewerage services to
be the responsibility of individual municipalities under the general super-
vision of the Ministry of Interior. Ilowever, legal provision exists for the
transfer of these functions to the Government, or to a separate legal entity,
if circumstances so require, in which case supervision becomes the responsi-
bility of the Ministry of Public Works. The main reasons for the establish-
ment of a separate authority would be those of financial viability, and tech-
nical competence.
A.   Salonica Water Authority
2.        The Salonica Water Authority (SWA) will not be directly concerned
with the construction aspects of the sewerage project but it will be involved
with the project in a number of ways. Firstly, as the principal water author-
ity within the project area, its level of production and distribution of water
are crucial to the design and operation of the sewerage system and continuous
accurate measurement of these factors is essential. Secondly SWA will act as
agent for the collection of sewerage charges based on water consumption.
Thirdly, it is expected that, in due course, the water and sewerage authori-
ties will combine, making it essential that there be closely related techni-
cal standards and common systems of accounting, financial reporting and fi-
nancial control.
3.        In January 1976 there was a total of 28 different water authorities
in the Salonica project area. However, SWA supplied almost 95% of the total
water and it is understood that it will take over responsibility for all
supplies of the area during 1976. Water is at present supplied to the new
industrial zones to the west of Salonica mainly from private wells, but SWA
has plans to extend its service to these areas in due course.
4.        SWA was established by Compulsory Law 1563 in 1939, to take over
from a French-based company which had been responsible for water supplies
to the city and surrounding district since the days of the Ottoman State in
1888. The authority is governed by a small Board of Directors chaired (ex-
officio) by the Mayor of Salonica. The Board is responsible for the control
of overall policy and administration and in particular for approving the rais-
ing of loans, budgets and annual reports, tariffs and construction projects.
The law delegates to the Chairman of the Board a general oversight of the



ANNEX 15
Page 2
implementation of its decisions. The Chairman also reviews deposits into and
withdrawals from the authority's bank accounts and co-signs payment orders
with the Director-General. There is also an Executive Committee which meets
regularly on a weekly basis to decide upon matters delegated to it by the
Board.
5.        The day-to-day operations of the authority are in the hands of a
Director-General who reports to the Board of Directors and attends its meet-
ings in an advisory capacity.
6.        The organization chart of the authority is given as Attachment 1.
There are currently about 430 administrative, technical and professional
staff and about 200 manual workers.
7.        All decisions of the authority of any importance are subject to
approval by various Government departments, such as the Mini'stry of Northern
Greece, Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Finance. All orders for the
payment of money are apparently forwarded for approval to the Ministry of
Finance branch office in Salonica, before payment.
8.        Tenders for the procurement of goods or the execution of works are
subject to approval by the Ministry of Northern Greece and/or the Ministry of
Public Works, depending on the estimated costs. Small contracts are approved
under delegated powers by the Prefect. Large construction expenditures fi-
nanced out of Government funds are sometimes handled entirely by the Ministry
of Public Works, which carries out construction and hands the works over to
SWA on completion.
9.        The authority's annual budget, after approval by its Board, is for-
warded to the Prefect, Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Finance for
approval. The number of personnel is controlled by the Ministry of Public
Works. The budget is drawn up and related accounts are kept on a simple cash
basis, with no clear distinction drawn between capital and recurrent revenues
and expenditures. Records of stores are kept on a quantity basis only. An-
nual financial statements in the form normally understood are not prepared.
Instead copies of all detailed financial statements, payment orders and sup-
porting documents are sent at the year end to various government offices in-
cluding the Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance, where they are frequently
retained for several years before being returned.
10.       Water is charged for by meter, with virtually all paying customers
being metered. Meters are read every three months on a rotating basis. Cer-
tain classes of customers (industrial, hospitals, municipalities and public
services) receive water at reduced rates. Free water is supplied to elemen-
tary public schools, and certain Government buildings. Unpaid accounts are
followed up and water services disconnected if these are not paid after due
reminder.
11.       The organization occupies well-appointed offices, which have be-
come, however, somewhat crowded.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
12.       A computer system is used for billing arrangements and a limited
number of other accounting and office machines are in use. There are pro-
posals for introducing a computer system to cover all accounting procedures.
B . Salonica Sewerage Authority
13.       Until December 31, 1975 sewerage in the project area was the respon-
sibility of the various Municipalities. On December 31, 1970 the Salonica
Sewerage Authority (SSA) was legally established by Legislative Decree 787/70
(as amended by Law No. 59/75) but, apart from undertaking certain construc-
tion works in 1975 this authority did not take over active responsibility for
the various sewerage systems until January 1, 1976.
14.       The new authority, which operates under the supervision of the Min-
istry of Public Works, is now responsible for the construction, maintenance and
operation of all sewerage systems within its area, together with stormwater
sewers and certain other land drainage facilities.
15.       Neither the new industrial zones to the east of Salonica, nor the
Mega Emvalon peninsula to the west, at present fall within the jurisdiction
of the new authority. The authority's jurisdiction can be extended by legis-
lative decree on the recommendation of the Minister of Public Works.
16.       SSA is controlled by a Board of 5 members, plus a chairman.  The
members of the Board are appointed by various government departments and by
the Salonica municipality. This Board was first appointed in October 1974,
with the task of establishing an administrative organization to take over
full responsibility for sewerage operations as soon as possible. The Board
is responsible for the control of overall policy and administration and, in
particular, for approving the raising of loans, budgets and annual reports,
tarifs and construction projects. The law delegates to the Chairman of the
Board a general oversight of the implementation of its decisions. The Chair-
man also co-signs payment orders with the Director-General.
17.       The day-to-day operations of the authority are in the hands of a
Director-General, who reports to the Board of Directors and attends its meet-
ings in an advisory capacity.
18.       The organization chart of the authority is given as Attachment 2.
By the end of 1977 the authority is expected to have about 135 administrative,
professional and technical staff, and about 130 manual workers. By January
1976 about 75 administrative, professional and technical staff and about 45
manual workers had been appointed.
19.       The laws governing the authority set out its duties and responsi-
bilities in considerable detail. All decisions of the authority of any impor-
tance are subject to approval by various government departments, such as the
Ministry of Northern Greece, Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Finance.
Payment orders are forwarded for approval to the Ministry of Finance branch
office in Salonica, before payment.



AMlNEX 15
Page 4
20.       Tenders for the procurement of goods or the execution of works are
subject to approval by the Ministry of Northern Greece and/or the Ministry of
Public Works, depending on the estimated costs. As. with the water authority
it is expected that large construction works financed out of public funds
would be handled entirely by the Ministry of Public Works which would carry
out construction and hand over the works to the authority on completion.
21.       The authority's annual budget, after approval by the Board, is for-
warded to the Prefect, Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Finance for
approval. The number of personnel is controlled by the Ministry of Public
Works.
22.       The budget is drawn up and the related accounts are to be kept on
a simple cash basis, with no clear distinction between capital and recurrent
expenses. Stores records have not yet been established but could be expected
to be kept on the basis of quantities only.
23.       It is not expected that the authority will be required to prepare
annual financial statements in the form normally understood. Instead, copies
of all detailed financial statements, payment orders and supporting documents
are expected to be sent at the year end to various government departments,
including the Audit Office of the Ministry of Finance.
24.       The law prescribes specific sources of revenue for the authority.
Its main revenue source for operations is a 40% surcharge on billings for
water. This is handled by the Salonica Water Authority through its computer-
ized billing system. The law also provides for the recovery of costs of con-
nection to the network and, in addition, for a contribution towards network
construction costs. Provision is also made in the law for funds equal to 3%
of actual or notional income from property rentals to be placed at the dis-
posal of the authority for construction or debt service. This revenue is
assessed and collected by the central Government through its income-tax pro-
cedures (Annex 21) and has been deposited in a special bank account. The
joint authorization of the Ministers of Public Works and Finance is needed
for its utilization.
25.       The authority has established itself in reasonably satisfactory
offices. Its accounts at the present time are kept on a very simple manual
basis, using loose leaf ledger cards of a fairly standard pattern.
26.       The authority does not operate a cesspit emptying service.  This
function is carried out by private contractors.
C.   Volos Area Water and Sewerage Authorities
27.       In the project area of Volos there are, at present, three main au-
thorities concerned with water supply and sewerage.



ANNEX 15
Page 5
28.       The principal authority is the Volos Municipal Water and Sewerage
Authority (VMWSA), which serves the area of Volos municipality and certain
surrounding districts. This authority was incorporated as a separate munic-
ipal water authority in 1962 under Royal Decree 591/62. In 1971, in accord-
ance with Royal Decree 714/70 the authority took over responsibility for
sewerage and stormwater services. Its formal title is now "Municipal Organ-
ization of Water Distribution and Sewerage System of Volos."
29.       The authority is managed by a six-member Board of Directors ap-
pointed by the Municipality, with the approval of the Prefect of Magnisia, and
with the Mayor of Volos as chairman.
30.       The organization chart of the authority is shown as Attachment 3.
As indicated, the authority has no Director-General. The chief technical of-
ficer and chief financial officer both report direct to the chairman (mayor)
who is consequently involved in a considerable amount of day-to-day activity.
In practice, the chairman signs various documents (work orders, payment orders,
etc.) which would normally be dealt with by a Director-General.
31.       The authority currently employs about 60 administrative, profes-
sional, and technical staff and about 60 manual workers.
32.       The authority must comply with many detailed regulations relating
to municipal operations and is responsible to the Ministry of Interior. All
decisions of any importance are subject to the approval of the Prefect, and
in certain instances by the Ministry of Interior. These decisions include
raising of loans, approval of budgets, fixing of tariffs and authorization
of construction work. In addition, the annual budget of the authority must
be approved by the Municipal Council before being forwarded to the Prefect.
33.       Construction work, with certain exceptions, is handled by the au-
thority. However, decisions on the selection of contractors, after tendering
procedures, are subject to the approval of the "Council of Public Works" of
the Ministry of Interior. The precise procedures for various approvals de-
pend upon different formal arrangements for funding, and in particular, the
extent to which government funds are involved.
34.       Arrangements exist for large construction works financed from gov-
ernment funds to be handled entirely by the Ministry of Public Works, which
would hand over the works to the authority on completion.
35.       The authority's accounts are kept in a manner prescribed by the
Ministry of Interior. They follow a simple cash basis, with no clear alloca-
tion between capital and recurrent activities. Stores accounts are kept on
a quantity only basis. Apart from the use of a computer service bureau for
billing (see below) all financial records are kept manually. Accounts are
balanced monthly and every four months all financial statements and support-
ing documents are forwarded for examination to the Prefect. At the end of
the year, these documents are forwarded to the Audit Office of the Ministry
of Finance where they are retained for several years before being returned
to the Authority.



ANNEX 15
Page 6
36.       The law prescribes specific revenues for the authority.  The main
revenue source for operations is a metered charge for water. Virtually all
charged water supplies are metered, and meters are read every two months. The
meter records are sent to a service bureau and the billing is prepared from
them by a computer. During the months when the meters are not read, the
meter readers are employed on meter repair work.
37.       A sewerage charge is levied at present at 40% of the water charge,
for those connected to a sewer system. Other water consumers pay a surcharge
of 10% to cover the costs of stormwater drainage.
38.       Charges are levied for connections to the water and sewer systems
and provision exists for contributions from consumers towards network exten-
sions.
39.       Free supplies of water (and free sewerage services) are provided to
churches and to the municipality for public gardens and street cleaning. Gov-
ernment establishments pay 40% of normal charges, as do hospitals and govern-
ment schools.
40.       The water supply service for the town of Nea Ionea is part of its
normal municipal services. There is no sewerage system. There is no separate
water department nor separate accounting arrangements. The financial reporting
and budget system of the Municipality is on a simple cash basis and the ac-
counting and billing systems are manual. External financial controls are
similar to those described above for VMWSA and the Municipality is similarly
subject to the control of the Prefect and the Ministry of Interior.
41.       Extensions to the water system are carried out by contract and the
operation and maintenance by the technical services of the Municipality.
There are about 15 personnel on the staff of the Municipality who are wholly
or mainly concerned with the water supply system.
42.       In the new industrial zone to the north-west of the city a separate
water supply system has been provided by the Hellenic Industrial Development
Bank (ETVA) as part of the site infrastructure. VMWSA operates and maintains
this system at the expense of ETVA and also collects revenues from the sale
of water to industrial premises on behalf of ETVA.
D.   Ministry of Public Works
43.       Attachment 4 is a simplified organization chart of the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW) showing in detail only the Ministry's Divisions which
will be involved in the project.
44.       The Water Supply and Sewerage Department of the Hydraulics
Division is responsible for approving all water supply and wastewater proj-
ects except those of Athens, for which the Hydraulics Division has created
a separate Athens Water Supply Department. The projects are prepared by



ANNEX 15
Page 7
private consultants and are usually financed through Government grants.
Project approval is granted exclusively on technical grounds and the con-
sultants are not required to provide financial feasibility analysis.
45.       Construction of all major projects under the jurisdiction of the MPW
(wastewater, water supply, irrigation, drainage, highways, housing, etc.) are
carried out by private contractors selected through public bidding and are
supervised by the Ministry's Regional Inspectorates. Accordingly, the con-
struction of the proposed Salonica and Volos sewerage projects would be super-
vised by the Macedonia and Thessalia Inspectorates, respectively.
46.       Design and construction of wastewater projects are governed by
detailed specifications issued by the MPW many years ago. Today, these are
badly outdated. These specifications cover only the collection systems and
fail to include most of the design criteria for pumping equipment, piping
materials, joints, linings, and coatings which are commonly used in current
sanitary engineering practice.
47.       The MPW requires now that all wastewater projects include treatment
facilities. However, since there are no guidelines in water quality criteria
and little expertise in wastewater disposal processes, the consultants have
often designed sophisticated treatment plants which have little or no relation
to the degree of treatment required. The lack of guidelines on industrial
wastewater discharge is a further cause for poorly designed projects.
48.       Wastewater projects are usually designed for the flows expected 40-50
years into the future but construction staging is rarely used so that over-
design is common. In some of the large interceptors built in Athens in recent
years, this over-design is already causing serious odor and corrosion problems.
49.       The Ministry is fully aware of the wastewater project's shortcomings
and to correct this situation is now creating a separate Wastewater Department
within the Hydraulics Division. The Ministry intends to develop expertise
within this Department in water pollution control, industrial wastewater man-
agement and in wastewater treatment and disposal processes. The Wastewater
Department would take over responsibility for approval of all wastewater
projects, update design and construction specifications and establish guide-
lines for water quality criteria and industrial wastewater discharges. The
Ministry intends, however, to gradually shift responsibility for construction
supervision to local sewerage authorities.
50.       The MPW also intends to create a project appraisal unit within its
Hydraulics Division. This unit, which would be staffed by engineering eco-
nomists and financial analysts, would analyze the economic and financial
feasibility of all hydraulics projects and would advise local authorities
on financial problems.



ANNEX 15
Page 8
E.   The Institute of Oceanographic and Fishing Research (IOKAE)
51.       IOKAE is a semi-autonomous organization created in 1965 under the
Ministry of Culture and Science to undertake research on oceanography and
fisheries.
52.       IOKAE's activities remained confined to ichthyology (study of fish)
until 1973 when the Government, at the suggestion of the UNDP, sought IOKAE's
participation in the feasibility studies for the sewerage of Athens. Since
that time and with UNDP's assistance, IOKAE has been hiring personnel and
acquiring equipment for physical oceanography.
53.       The Athens studies have been delayed, so in 1975, the Government
assigned to IOKAE the preliminary oceanographic surveys for the Salonica
and Volos sewerage projects. These surveys, conducted under terms of
reference suggested by the Bank, were complete and accurate.
54.       IOKAE has now on its staff 28 professionals, of which 23 have
studied abroad, and recruitment continues to fill newly created positions.
Laboratory space is presently about 400 m3 but plans are already underway to
provide an additonal 600 m3 by 1977. Equipment for physical oceanography is
adequate but additional equipment is needed for geological oceanography and
meteorology.
55.       IOKAE has now only two small boats so it needs to borrow oceano-
graphic vessels from the Navy's Hydrographic Office.  The Government intends,
however, to provide IOKAE with suitably equipped oceanographic and fishing
ships in the near future.
56.       The Government considers that the participation of IOKAE is essen-
tial for controlling the pollution of ocean waters and desires to expand
further its technical capabilities. Consequently, the oceanographic studies
included in this project were designed to provide not only the data required
for final project design, but also to develop within IOKAE expertise on
monitoring of ocean waters and preparation of mathematical models of water
quality.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Explanation of Financing Plans
A.   Salonica
1.        It is proposed that Dr. 1,032.5 million (US$29.5 million) of the Bank
loan be allocated to this project component. This would cover about 29% of
funds requirements, and the full project foreign exchange costs. (The table
shows a disbursement lag, which would be temporarily covered by increased Gov-
ernment finance).
2.        Contributions are assumed to be received from industry towards
identifiable incremental capital costs of industrial sewers amounting to
Dr. 63.6 million and a further Dr. 152.5 million is assumed from capital con-
tributions from non-industrial sources. Together, these contributions would
cover about 6% of funds requirements.
3.        Property taxes expected to be assigned to SSA during the construc-
tion period are estimated to contribute Dr. 693.0 million towards funds re-
quirements and the redemption of the investment of earlier property tax
receipts will amount to Dr. 175.5 million. Together, these sources will pro-
vide about 24% of funds requirements.
4.        Net internal cash generation is estimated at Dr. 321.0 million,
which, after having allowed for growing debt service requirements of Dr. 479.9
million, will provide about 9% of funds requirements. This low proportion re-
flects the fact that present tariffs are far too low and are expected to be
gradually raised during the construction period. It also reflects the amor-
tization of the Bank loan in 1980 and 1981 (Dr 86.0 million in each year) re-
sulting from the 3-year grace period.
5.        All other funds requirements, after allowing for the foregoing, are
assumed to be provided in the form of a loan from the Government, amounting
to Dr. 1,516.7 million and providing about 42% of funds requirements.
B.   Volos
6.        It is proposed that Dr. 213.5 million (US$6.1 million) of the Bank
loan be allocated to this project component, which would cover about 22% of
funds requirements and the full project foreign exchange costs. (The table
shows a disbursement lag, which would be temporarily covered by increased
Government finance).

7.        Contributions are assumed to be received from industry towards
identifiable incremental capital costs of industrial sewers, amounting to
Dr. 43.7 million and a further Dr. 93.5 million is assumed from capital con-
tributions from non-industrial sources. Together, these contributions would
cover about 14% of funds requirements.
8.        Net internal cash generation is estimated at Dr. 216.2 million,
which, after having provided for growing debt service requirements of Dr.
127.9 million will provide about 22% of funds requirements. This relatively
low proportion reflects the fact that present water tariffs are too low and
are expected to be gradually raised during the construction period. It also
reflects the amortization of the Bank loan in 1980 and 1981 (Dr. 17.8 million
in each year) resulting from the 3-year grace period. Full sewerage tariffs
are not expected to be implemented until the project is completed.
9.        All other funds requirements, after allowing for the foregoing, are
assumed to be provided from Government sources. Half of this sum is assumed
to be in the form of equity and the remainder as a loan. Together, these gov-
ernment funds are assumed to provide almost 60% of funds requirements.

Salonica Sewerage Authority
Assumptions for Financial Projections
A. General
1.        Because the authority keeps its accounts on a simple cash basis, the
financial forecasts are pro-forma only, prepared by the application of gener-
ally accepted accounting principles to the basic data. Provision has been
made for inflation of capital cost in accordance with guidelines shown in para
4.08 of the report. Operating costs allow for inflation of 10% in 1976, 9%
in 1977, and 8% in each subsequent year. Forecasts for 1976 are based on the
authority's budget, with subsequent extrapolations in accordance with princi-
ples described below.
B. Income Statements
Revenues
2.        The average tariffs based on water consumption are assumed as indi-
cated in the income statement. Differentials between industrial and other
tariffs must await the substantial completion of the industrial wastewater
survey.
3.        Connection charges for 1976 are based on the authority's budget.
For subsequent years, they represent increases due to inflation, based on
full cost recovery but with a 20% allowance for costs not recovered and lags
in implementation.
Operating Expenses
4.        Salaries and wages reflect expected increases in staffing until
the end of 1976 as the authority builds up to full capacity. Expenses for
fuel and power, materials and administration have been based on 1976 esti-
mates with provision for system growth. Connection costs and operating
costs of the proposed sewage treatment plant are estimated by the mission
based on the reports of consulting engineers.



ANNEX 18
Page 2
Depreciation
5.        Present accounting practice does not provide for the charging of
depreciation. The forecasts assume a depreciation rate of 2-1/2% on original
costs, thus writing off assets, on average, over 40 years.
Interest
6.         Interest, on the proposed Bank loan at 8.7%, and on the assumed
Government loan at 8%, has been charged to operations throughout.
Net Income
7.        All net income is assumed to be retained earnings.
C. Funds Flow Statements
Borrowing
8.   (a)  IBRD - Dr. 1,032.5 million (US$29.5 million equivalent) for
15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, interest at
8.7% per annum, commitment charge of 0.75% on the undisbursed
balance and repayment by equal installments of principal.
(b)  Government - Dr. 1,516.7 million (US$43.3 million equivalent)
during the project period (1977-1981), at 8%, with repayment
beginning in 1982, by equal installments of combined principal
and interest over 20 years.
(c) Government - for each separate year of the period 1982 -
1985 with repayment beginning in each case in the year
following disbursement and otherwise on the same terms
as in (b) above, in annual amounts as follows:
1983 Dr. 64.9 million
1984 Dr. 74.7 million
1985 Dr. 62.8 million
Capital Contributions
9.        Contributions are assumed from industries towards project construc-
tion costs amounting to 40% of the costs of Gallikos and Esso estate second-
ary networks, 60% of the cost of trunk mains for the Gallikos and Esso es-
tates and 60% of the cost of the Gallikos trunk sewer. These contributions
are estimated as follows:
1977 Dr. 5.0 million        1980 Dr. 15.6 million
1978 Dr. 12.6 million       1981 Dr. 16.3 million
1979 Dr. 14.1 million



ANNEX 18
Page 3
10.       Contributions from other sewer users are assumed to be recovered
towards 25% of the costs of secondary network construction.
Property Tax
11.       By law, receipts from pr6perty tax can be used only to finance con-
struction costs and related debt service. Furthermore, the tax is collecti-
ble only for a 20-year period. Because of these legal restrictions, receipts
from this tax have been treated as capital receipts rather than as annual
revenues. Estimates are based on the budget figure for 1976, increased in
proportion to population growth and with appropriate allowance for infla-
tion. During the project period, the funds from this source are estimated
to total Dr. 693 million (US$19.8 million equivalent).
12.       Sums accumulated from property taxes prior to January 1, 1976 and
amounting to Dr. 175.5 million (US$5.0 million equivalent) have been sep-
arately invested. The forecasts assume that these funds will be made avail-
able to finance construction during the five years of the project period, in
equal annual installments.
Credit for Connection Fees and Capital Contributions
13.       The law provides for credit to be made available for up to 2 years
to assist consumers in paying for connection fees and capital contributions.
Because estimates of these credit requirements are subject to wide margins
of error, no provision has been made for them in the forecasts. It is ex-
pected however, that any necessary credit would be financed by loans, on
terms and conditions broadly equivalent to the credit terms themselves. Con-
sequently, the flow of funds should not be materially affected by this omis-
sion.
Internal Cash Ratio
14.       The internal cash ratio is the percentage ratio of net funds avail-
able from operations to the average net value of fixed assets in operation
and under construction. Industrial contributions in the period 1977 to 1981
(para 9) have been excluded from the calculation of net funds available from
operations. In addition, amortization of the Bank loan in 1980 and 1981 has
been excluded from the calculation of debt charges. Because of the shortened
grace period (3 years) these payments represent premature debt redemption
which must be covered by raising equivalent finance from other sources.
D. Balance Sheet
Fixed Assets
15.       Fixed assets in operation at January 1, 1976 have been valued ac-
cording to information provided by financial and engineering consultants.
Subsequent additions to fixed assets provide for project construction and



ANNEX 18
Page 4
for the construction of additional secondary networks during the period
1977-1981. From 1982 to 1985, provision is made for the construction of
additional secondary networks, trunk mains, interceptors and pumping sta-
tions and for a treatment plant and ocean outfall at Mega Emvalon. No
revaluation of assets has been assumed, pending the establishment, in due
course, of more precise valuations for the presently existing system and
also because of the material significance of the costs of newly constructed
assets.
Long-Term Investments
16.       Long term investments represent accumulated collections of prop-
erty tax as at January 1, 1976 reduced annually by utilization towards con-
struction costs as explained in paragraph 12.
Current Assets and Current Liabilities
17.       Accounts receivable have been projected on the basis of about
2-1/2 months revenues. Inventories represent 4 months' usage of materials
for maintenance. Cash represents about 1-1/2 months' cash operating expenses.
Accounts payable represent 2-1/2 months' purchase of materials for operation
maintenance and administration.

Tariffs
1.        Within three months after entering into the Volos Subsidiary Agree-
ment VWSO is to increase its tariff by a weighted average of 45%. It is as-
sumed for the purposes of the financial projections that this tariff increase
will take place no later than July 1, 1977.
2.        Estimated average tariffs for the years 1977-1985, as used in the
financial projections, are as follows:

Proposed Volos Water and Sewerage Authority
Assumptions for Financial Projections
A. General
1.        Because of the intention to set up a single water and sewerage au-
thority for the entire Volos project area, the financial forecasts are pre-
pared as if this single authority were already in operation. In preparing
such composite forecasts for 1976, information has been drawn from budgets
relating to the present Volos Water and Sewerage Authority, the water ser-
vices of Nea Ionia municipality and the water services of the new industrial
area. Where relevant information has been lacking, estimates have been made
by the mission, based on data supplied by the financial consultants. Sub-
sequent extrapolations from 1977 onwards are in accordance with principles
described below.
2.        Since the various authorities keep their accounts on a simple cash
basis, the financial forecasts are pro-forma only, prepared by the applica-
tion of generally accepted accounting principles to the basic data. Provi-
sion has been made for the inflation of capital costs in accordance with
guidelines shown in para 4.08 of the report. Operating costs allow for
inflation at 10% in 1976, 9% in 1977 and 8% in each subsequent year.
B. Income Statements
Revenues
3.        The average tariffs for water usage, and for sewer usage based on
water consumption are assumed as indicated in the respective income state-
ments. Differentials between industrial and other wastewater tariffs must
await the substantial completion of the industrial wastewater survey. Dif-
ferentials may also be appropriate for water tariffs, at the option of the
authority, particularly to allow for the gradual equalization of tariffs
between adjoining areas incorporated within the authority's jurisdiction.
4.        Sewerage tariffs are assumed to remain at 40% of water tariffs until
the new sewer system begins to come into operation in 1980. It is assumed
that the 10% surcharge on water tariffs presently levied upon water users



ANNEX 20
Page 2
not connected to the sewerage system will continue indefinitely. From 1977
it is assumed that all industrial premises connected to a sewerage network,
including the new industrial zone, will be subjected to the 40% sewer sur-
charge.
5.        Connection charges are based on 50% of cost in 1976 and 1977, 60%
in 1978, 70% in 1979 and 80% thereafter, finally reflecting full cost re-
covery, but with a 20% allowance for costs not recovered and lags in imple-
mentation. Water connections anticipated to be taken over from outlying
areas of Volos have been left out of account in the calculation of connection
charges.
Operating Expenses
6.        Salaries and wages, materials, administration, fuel, power and
chemicals for water supply reflect annual growth in system capacity and in
water consumption. For sewerage, operating costs are assumed to remain con-
stant, except for inflation, until the new system begins to become opera-
tional in 1980. Operating costs thereafter are based on mission estimates
and will reflect annual system growth.
Depreciation
7.        Present accounting practice does not provide for the charging of
depreciation. The forecasts assume depreciation rates on the original costs
of fixed assets of 3% for water and 2-1/2% for sewerage.
Interest
8.        Interest on debt outstanding at January 1, 1976 has been computed
by the mission for each separate loan on the basis of information provided
by the financial consultants. During the project construction period until
1981, interest on the proposed Bank loan at 8.7% and on the assumed Govern-
ment loan of 8% has been charged to construction. Thereafter, all interest
has been charged to operations.
Net Income
8.        All net income is assumed to be retained earnings.
C. Funds Flow Statements
Borrowing
10.  (a)  IBRD - Dr. 213.5 million (US$6.1 million equivalent) for
15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, interest
at 8.7% per annum, commitment charge of 0.75% on the un-
disbursed balance and repayment by equal installments
of principal.



ANNEX 20
Page 3
(b) Government - Dr. 276.8 million (US$7.9 million equivalent)
during the project period (1977-1981) at 8% with repayment
beginning in 1982, by equal installments of combined prin-
cipal and interest over 20 years.
(c) Government - for each separate year of the period 1981-1985
with repayment beginning in each case in the year following
disbursement and otherwise on the same terms as in (b) above,
in annual amounts as follows:
1982 - Dr.  0.5 million          1984 - Dr. 51.4 million
1983 - Dr. 29.2 million          1985 - Dr. 77.5 million
Capital Contributions
11.       Contributions are assumed from industries to cover the project con-
struction costs of the trunk main from the industrial area to the main inter-
ceptor and to cover the costs of the secondary network on the new industrial
estate. These contributions are estimated as follows:
1977 - Dr. 3.8 million           1979 - Dr. 20.8 million
1978 - Dr. 19.1 million
12.       Contributions from other sewer users are assumed to be recovered
towards 25% of the costs of secondary network construction.
Government Grant
13.       A Government grant, or equity contribution, is assumed to cover one-
half of each year's net cash requirements after allowing for other sources of
finance, during the period of project construction.
Credit for Connection Fees and Capital Contributions
14.       It is assumed that credit will be provided, for up to 2 years, to
assist consumers in paying for connection fees and capital contributions. Be-
cause estimates of these credit requirements are subject to wide margins of
error, no provision has been made for them in the forecasts. It is expected,
however, that any necessary credit would be financed by loans, on terms and
conditions broadly equivalent to the credit terms themselves. Consequently,
the flow of funds should not be materially affected by this omission.
Internal Cash Ratio
15.       The internal cash ratio is the percentage ratio of net funds avail-
able from operations to the average net value of fixed assets in operation and
under construction. Industrial contributions assumed during the period 1977-
1979 (para 11) have been excluded from the calculation of net funds available
from operations.  In addition, amortization of the Bank loan in 1980 and 1981



ANNEX 20
Page 4
has been excluded from the calculation of debt charges. Because of the short-
ened grace period (3 years) these payments represent premature debt redemption
which must be covered by raising equivalent finance from other sources.
D. Balance Sheet
Fixed Assets
15.       Fixed assets in operation at January 1, 1976 have been valued ac-
cording to information provided by financial and engineering consultants.
Subsequent additions to fixed assets provide for project construction and
for the construction of additional water and sewer networks. In 1984 and
1985, provision has been made for the construction of an additional source
of water supply. No revaluation of assets has been assumed, pending the es-
tablishment in due course, of more precise valuations for the presently ex-
isting systems and also because of the material significance of the costs
of newly constructed assets.
Current Assets and Current Liabilities
16.       Accounts receivable have been projected on the basis of about 2-1/2
months' revenues. Inventories represent 4 months' usage of chemicals and of
materials for maintenance. Cash represents 1-1/2 months' cash operating ex-
penses. Accounts payable represent 2-1/2 months' purchase of materials for
operation maintenance and administration.

Tariffs and Other Revenues
I. Present Situation
A.   Salonica - Present Water Tariffs
1.        The Salonica Water Authority (SWA) levies a basic tariff in Drachma
per m3 with discounts to certain classes of consumer, as follows:
Industrial                                           15%
Hospitals and medical centers                        25%
Municipality (bulk supplies) and
non-elementary schools                             50%
Public services                                      15%
Elementary schools and official
Government residences                             100%
2.        As a result of these arrangements, water tariffs over recent years
have been (in general) as follows:
Price (Dr. per m3)
Consumer Class                                    1970-1974  1975 to date
Domestic and Commercial                             4.50          7.00
Industrial                                          3.75          5.95
Hospitals and medical centers                       3.30          5.25
Municipalities (bulk) and non-
elementary schools                                2.20          3.50
Public services                                     3.75          5.95
Elementary schools and official
Government residences                               -             -
Minimum consumption
(per customer every 3 months)                     6 m3          15 m3
3.        In addition to the above, certain special arrangements are made with
individual consumers. For example, in 1976 it is estimated that about 10 mil-
lion m3 will be supplied to the Esso industrial complex at Dr. 2.45 per m3
representing a discount of 65% from the basic tariff (60% from the above dis-
counted industrial tariff).



ANNEX 21
Page 2
4.        For all customers other than domestic and commercial, a special 60%
surcharge is being levied on the basic (discounted) charges as a contribution
towards the development of new sources of supply. (In the case of the Esso
complex, this surcharge is only 15%.)
5.        Other revenues of SWA (e.g. connection fees, etc.) will not be
described in detail as they do not affect sewer revenues.
B.   Salonica - Present Sewer Tariffs
6.        Until December 31, 1975 sewer services were under the control of
the various municipalities in the Salonica area and their operations were
financed by various municipal revenues. For example, in the Municipality of
Salonica sewer fees were based on 20% of charges for garbage collection and
street cleaning levied directly upon frontagers.
7.        From January 1, 1976, with the coming into full operation of the
Salonica Sewerage Authority, sewer charges are to be based on 40% of the
water charges to those water consumers connected to the sewerage system.
The 40% charge is not to be levied upon the water surcharge levied for the
development of new water supply sources.
8.        Based on the tariffs for water, the sewerage tariffs would approxi-
mate to the following:
Consumer Class                                      Price (Dr. per m3)
Domestic and Commercial                                    2.80
Industrial                                                 2.40
Hospitals and Medical Centers                              2.10
Non-elementary Schools                                     1.40
Public Services                                            2.40
Elementary Schools and official
Government residences                                     -
9.        Charges are made by SSA to cover the costs of house connections at
the rate of Dr. 1500 per meter of connection pipe.
10.       Consumer contributions towards network construction are collected
according to the following formula:
a x b x c
yd
d
Where:



ANNEX 21
Page 3
y = amount of contribution per property
a = length of property frontage in meters
b = number of floors
c = estimated cost per meter of pipe (currently Dr. 1,500)
d = average number of floors per building (assumed to be 6)
11.       Since 1972 SSA has been assigned the proceeds of a tax of 3% on
nominal rental values, collected through the income tax system as described
below. These funds are intended to be used for financing construction ex-
penditures or meeting debt charges. The proceeds of the tax are deposited
in a special bank account and can only be withdrawn on the joint authoriza-
tion of the Ministers of Works and Finance.
12.       Annual collections over past years have been as follows:
Year                       Dr. (million)
1972                            35.8
1973                            46.6
1974                            56.3
1975                            81.9
220.6
13.       About Dr. 45 million has apparently been used for construction work
during 1975 and for initial expenses of setting up the authority, leaving a
balance of Dr. 175.5 million as at January 1, 1975 invested in the special
bank account.
C.   Volos - Present Water and Sewer Tariffs
14.       The Volos Water and Sewerage Authority levies a basic tariff in
Drachma per m3 for water supply. However, various Government institutions,
including schools and hospitals, pay only 40% of the normal charge. Water
for municipal parks and street cleaning is provided free.
15.       For water consumers connected to the present sewerage system,
there is a surcharge of 40% on the water charge. For all other water con-
sumers, there is a surcharge of 10%, to cover the costs of the stormwater
system.
16.       Based on the above principles, the various water and sewerage
tariffs over recent years have been as follows:



ANNEX 21
Page 4
Price (Dr. per m3)
1970-1974           1975 to date
Consumer Class                             Water  Sewerage        Water  Sewerage
Domestic, Commercial and Industrial        5.00    2.00 1/          7.00    2.80 1/
Government Premises                         2.00    0.80            2.80    1.12
Municipal Services                            -       -               -        -
17.       Charges are made by VMWSA to cover the cost of house connections at
the rate of Dr. 1,500 per connection for water and Dr. 3,000 per connection
for sewerage. Provision also exists for the recovery of capital contribu-
tions towards network extensions. This is apparently done on an ad hoc
basis.
18.       In the Municipality of Nea Ionea there is a present water charge
of Dr. 5.00 per m3 subject to similar discounts for special classes of con-
sumers as in Volos.
D.   Property Tax System
19.       Because SSA derives part of its funds from a property tax and since
this system could be extended to other areas in the future, a brief descrip-
tion of the present system of property tax follows.
20.       Unlike the situation in many countries, property tax in  Greece is
not collected as local (municipal) revenue on the basis of an approved list
of property valuations. Instead, it is assessed and collected through the
income tax system by regional tax collection offices of the Central Govern-
ment, controlled from Athens.
21.       There are three main systems of property tax:
(a) a transfer tax levied at 11%-13% on the market value of
property at the time of sale;
(b) a tax on total personal real estate held in Greece in
excess of a valuation of Dr. 10 million; and
(c) an annual tax on actual or notional rents.
22.       The transfer tax is straightforward and self explanatory.  The tax
on total personal real estate is a new tax designed to tax excess wealth. At
a guess, it applies to only about 5,000 taxpayers in the whole country.
1/   For premises connected to the sewerage system.  For other premises the
charge would be Dr. 0.50 and Dr. 0.70 respectively.



ANNEX 21
Page 5
23.        The annual tax on rental values is the tax which currently is par-
tially appropriated for sewerage purposes in Salonica (and also in Athens).
This is a little more complicated.
24.       Every year each taxpayer includes on his income tax return a state-
ment of his earnings from the rental of properties owned. In the case of
owner-occupiers, the taxpayer makes an assessment of the probable annual
rent to be derived from his property if it were to be let to a tenant. This
value is either accepted by the tax authorities or arbitrarily changed follow-
ing discussion with the taxpayer. The annual rental value cannot exceed 4%
of capital value and tax is not payable on annual rents or rental valuations
of less than Dr. 36,000 (about $85 per month). Consequently, no tax is pay-
able on a property with a capital value of less than Dr. 900,000 (about
US$25,000). The actual or nominal rental income is incorporated into the
taxpayer's total taxable income, which becomes subject to assessment for
income tax in accordance with normal procedures. If a sewerage tax is levied
upon the rental value, this would be in addition to normal rates of income
tax.
II. Observations on Specific Aspects of Water and Sewerage Tariffs
A.   Volos - Differential Tariffs
1.        A flat rate tariff is charged (with certain exceptions) for all
water supplied. In Volos, this is Dr. 7.00 per m3 and in Nea Ionea Dr. 5.00
per m3. When the various authorities are merged it seems reasonable for the
tariffs in the different areas to be brought into line gradually over (say) 3
or 4 years. For example, the present tariff of Nea Ionea is about 70% of that
for Volos. In 1977 it could remain at 70%, in 1978 go up to 80%, in 1979 to
90% and in 1980 to 100% of the Volos tariff. This would help to meet the
legitimate concerns of the Nea Ionea community about being "taken over" by
Volos.
B.   Free and Subsidized Supplies
2.        Many public buildings are provided with water at concessional rates
or, in certain cases free. There can be no rational justification for this
and if the new authority is to have financial autonomy these concessions
should be eliminated. Furthermore, experience tends to show that the use
of water charges as an income distribution device is not very effective and
therefore other organizations being supplied at concessional rates should also
have these eliminated, as far as possible.
3.        There may be some justification, on grounds of equity, in provid-
ing a limited supply, at low prices, with a steep rise in tariffs for sup-
plies beyond the minimum. This could have a possible effect of conserving
water sold at the higher prices.



ANNEX 21
Page 6
C.   Stormwater Sewers and Water for Municipal Gardens and Standpipes
4.        Conventionally, stormwater systems should be paid for from munici-
pal taxes, or by the highway authority. Water for municipal gardens and
standpipes should be paid for from municipal taxes. However, in Greece,
there are few, if any, independent sources of local revenue. The traditional
local tax in many countries is a property tax but in Greece this is appro-
priated by the Central Government. Furthermore, with the present partial
combination of wastewater and stormwater sewers it is very difficult if not
impossible to separate the costs of operation of each. It may therefore
be appropriate, in these special circumstances, for the stormwater service
and the free supplies of water to municipal parks and standpipes to be
borne by the water and sewer authority from increased water and sewer.
charges, at least until other, more satisfactory arrangements have been
formulated. Conceptually the increase in charges to cover these additional
costs is analogous to a "public utility tax" which might, in other circum-
stances, be levied by a municipal authority to finance the stormwater and
municipal parks service (including the purchase of water). It should be
stressed that these arrangements are not ideal and any review of municipal
finances should allow for the payment of water charges and a full-cost
recovery basis from public revenue sources. This would, among other things,
assist in the control of waste consumption. In any event, all public sup-
plies should be metered for purposes of control and measurement, even if no
charge is to be made.
III. Future Tariffs for Industrial Wastewater
1.        The introduction in Salonica of sewerage tariffs based on metered
water consumption and the continuation of such arrangements in Volos is con-
sistent with practice increasingly followed elsewhere. These tariff arrange-
ments are expected to continue. The use of metered water consumption as a
measure of usage of sewerage facilities is only approximate. However, where
domestic and commercial premises only are involved, the advantages of using
the metered water consumption as a basis for sewer charges usually outweigh
the disadvantages. In certain circumstances, refinements can be fairly easily
developed, such as the use of winter billings to eliminate excessive sewer
charges relative to non-sewered use of water in summer (e.g. irrigation of
gardens).
2.        Where there is heavy industrial usage of water, or production of
wastewater, additional complications arise. In particular:
(a) Certain industries, such as breweries or soft-drink manu-
facturers, may use large quantities of water which are
incorporated into their products and not disposed of
into the sewers; and



ANNEX 21
Page 7
(b) Certain industries may produce wastes which, for various
reasons may:
(i) be toxic to natural life, such as plants and
fish, in the areas in which they will be dis-
posed of; or
(ii) inhibit the operation of the sewerage system,
for example by the corrosion of pipes or damage
to treatment works; or
(iii) require transmission, treatment and disposal ar-
rangements out of proportion to the volume of
wastewater produced, for example because of
heavy loadings of BODs or suspended solids, or
because of high temperatures.
3.        For those industries not discharging wastewater proportionate to
water supplied, suitable formulae can be established to give the necessary
financial relief. Ideally, toxics and inhibitors should be prohibited from
entering the system at all. This could be achieved by a suitable combina-
tion of penalty charges and/or enforceable regulations. Heavy pollutant
loadings can be treated either by the polluting industries themselves, or
by the sewerage authority at the expense of such industries, with costs
being recovered through a suitable industrial waste surcharge.
4.        The establishment of suitable industrial wastewater surcharges will
entail a matching of such surcharges with incremental costs of the conveyance,
treatment and disposal of the relevant wastes. The establishment of pollutant
loadings will result from the proposed industrial wastewater surveys (Annex 7).
A relatively small number of heavy polluters will be specifically identified
and their pollutant loadings determined. For the remaining industries, it is
probable that standard pollutant loadings could be calculated by the use of
technical formulae, taking into account of the type of process, unit quanti-
ties of water consumption and other known process inputs. These ascertained
or standard pollutant loadings could then be used as the basis for industrial
wastewater surcharges. A particular industry claiming that the standard
pollutant loadings were an incorrect reflection of the actual loadings pro-
duced, would have the onus of proving this claim to the sewerage authority
at its own expense.
5.        Incremental costs of handling industrial wastewater could be ob-
tained from the sewerage authority's financial records and from engineering
estimates.
6.        Industrial wastewater surcharges calculated on the basis of the
above information could be imposed upon measured or imputed volumes of
effluent or converted to a suitable factor for imposition upon water
charges.

Tariffs - Long-Term Cost Recovery
1.        Although the proposed investments are the least cost solutions to
the sewerage problems of Salonica and Volos (paragraph 7.01) the tariffs
being proposed have been established largely to meet short-term financial
considerations dominated by cash-flow requirements. These tariffs cannot be
given meaningful economic interpretation because of the difficulties of
quantifying the numerous benefits from the projects (paragraph 7.03), because
the concept of willingness to pay cannot be established, and because long-run
incremental unit costs cannot be meaningfully calculated. The tables on
pages 2 and 3, therefore, give a general indication for each city of the
average tariffs required to recover estimated long-term financial costs at
constant 1976 prices using a 10% discount rate.
2.        For Salonica, the tariff to recover such costs in 1976 prices
would be approximately Dr. 6.80 per m3. The proposed tariff of Dr. 13 per m3
for 1982, the first full year of operation of the new system, expressed in
1976 constant prices, would be equal to about Dr. 8.00 per m3.
3.        For Volos, the tariff to recover costs in 1976 prices would be
approximately Dr. 10.30 per m3. The proposed tariff of Dr. 14.00 per m3 for
1981, the first full year of operation of the new system, expressed in 1976
constant prices would be equal to about Dr. 8.60 per m3, with the charge
from non-sewered water users equivalent to about a further 0.40 per m3.
4.        This cost recovery analysis suggests that the proposed tariff poli-
cies for each of the two areas are broadly reasonable. Any implied element
of subsidy, for example, in Volos, would be minor, and would be adeqquately
justified by the Government's objective of meeting national environmental
goals. It is expected that industrial waste surcharges, would, in any case,
be based on full recovery of the costs of handling the additional industrial
pollution.

APPRAISAL OF
THE SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
GREECE
Project Justification
General
1.        There is increasing recognition of the important public health
benefits which derive from well conceived sewerage projects. However, imple-
mentation of such projects has often been lagged because formulae for economic
quantification of these health benefits are not available and also because in-
dustries, which are usually the main polluters, have been generally reluctant
to accept the costs for preventing environmental deterioration, which effects
are often controversial and sometime unknown.
2.        Throughout the world, industrialization and heavy urban concentration
have resulted in massive discharges of chemical and organic wastes into the
oce-ans and fresh water bodies which have caused important environmental modi-
fications never before experienced or anticipated. In a few cases certainty
of the dangers inherent to such modifications have been found, but more com-
monly medical certainty is likely to be achievable only long after the fact.
However, common sense demands regulatory action to prevent harm even if there
is less than certainty that harm is otherwise inevitable.
Expertise on Water Pollution Control
3.        The Government is aware of the conflict between industrial and urban
expansion and public health protection through preservation of the environ-
ment. However, the Government is also concerned with the high incidence of
waterborne diseases (see Attachment 1) and the damage being caused to the
tourist and fishing industries by the gross pollution of the coastal waters.
Consequently, the Government has considered that the main objectives of the
present project should be the upgrading of local expertise sewerage design, in
water pollution control and industrial wastewater management and the establish-
ment of entities capable of coping-with the technical and financial aspects of
these problems. To attain these objectives the project includes a number of
technical, financial and institutional studies which constitute, in themselves,
an important justification of the project.
Public Health
4.        Incidences of water-borne diseases in Salonica and Volos are tabulated
in Attachment 1. Even though this data is far too sketchy to provide accurate
conclusions, it shows some general trends, as follows:



ANNEX 23
Page 2
(a)  Incidence of water-borne diseases has been consistently
higher in Salonica, where the coastal waters are heavily
contaminated, than in Volos, where only incipient conta-
mination exists.
(b)  The reduction in the incidence of hepatitis registered in
Salonica since 1972 coincides with the closing of the
beaches located in the heavily contaminated inner Salonica
Bay.
(c)  The typhoid outbreak recorded in 1972 in Volos was thought
to be due to contamination of the drinking water aquifer
by percolation from septic tanks. This outbreak was one
of the main reasons for the city's decision to proceed with
the new Kaliakouda water supply, which is presently being
completed at an estimated cost of Dr. 51 million.
5.        The Axios River valley is the largest available area for future
urban development of Greater Salonica, but at the same time it contains the
main underground aquifer presently providing drinking and industrial water
to the city. Wastewater disposal through septic tanks is unacceptable in this
area.
6.        Outside of the danger to public health, the actual proliferation of
septic tanks represents heavy expenditures to the population of both cities.
In Greater Salonica the present annual cost of maintenance and cleaning of
septic tanks was estimated by the consultants at Dr. 80 million and in Volos
at Dr. 14 million.
Recreational Benefits
7.        Recreational benefits resulting from the construction of the Salonica
sewerage project are likely to be significant, since the beaches located in
the inner bay, which have already been closed can be re-opened following
completion of the project. The project will also protect the beaches of Perea
and Agia Trias in the outer bay which are presently threatened by the growing
pollution.
8.        In Volos, recreational benefits are further into the future since
bacteriological contamination has reached significant values only in the part
of Goritsa beach, close to the city.
Fisheries
9.        Fishing within Salonica Bay has been forbidden for several years.
The economic importance of this ban has been relatively small since it affects
only recreational and small scale fishing. However, the main commercial shell-
fish beds, located at Mega Emvolon Cape, are in waters already being threatened
by the expanding pollution. The Xerias Creek, which carries wastewater from



ANNEX 23
Page 3
the Industrial Estate into Volos Bay, is already affecting the water quality
of the Bay, so that the expansion of pollution from this source is an increas-
ing threat to the adjacent commercial fisheries.
Land Values
10.       Increases of land costs have been a favorite tool for attempting to
quantify economical benefits due to water pollution control projects, so that
in both cities the consultants studied this approach in some detail. In
Salonica the consultants concluded that land value increases resulting from
the proposed project could be in the range between Dr. 5,000 - 12,500 million.
In Volos the consultants reached a total estimate of Dr. 400 million. These
increases in land values can only be a very general indicator of project
benefits and, to a considerable extent, will overlap the benefits described
above.
