THE HELLENIC STATE
SALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1345-GR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and
achievements of the Salonica and Volos Sewerage Project for which
Loan 1345-GR of US$ 36.0 million was made to the Hellenic State.
The loan was signed on February 3, 1977, became effective November
30, 1978, and the final disbursement was made in December 1984. The
project was implemented by the Ministry of Public Works.
The Project Completion Report wes prepared by the Europe,
Middle East and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of the
findings of a project completion mission which visited Greece in
April/May 1985 and of a review of the Staff Appraisal and
President's reports, the Loan Agreement and supervision, progress
and other reports related to project implementation.
In accordance with revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft
PCR to the Government/Borrower and Executing Agency. However, no com-
ments were received.

THE HELLENIC STATE
3NALONICA AND VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
LOAN 1345-GR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.    Loan 1345-GR was made to the Greek Government on December 7, 1976 for an
amount of US$36 million to help finance a sewerage project with national and
local objectives.
2.    The  project  included  technical assistance  to the MiniRtry of Public
Works, measures to strengthen the Salonica Sewerage Authority, the creation of
the Volos Water and Sewerage Authority and the provision of sewerage
infrastructure in Salonica and Volos, as well as a number of related studies
and training (para. 2.04).
3.    Modifications  in  the  legal  status  of  SSA  and  the creation of VWSA
required  conditions  of  effectiveness.   These  took  longer  than  originally
envisaged and the loan only became effective in November 1978, almost two
years  after  Bank  approval  (para.  3.01).   Delays  also  resulted  from  the
prevailing protracted bid evaluation/contract award process. Construction was
also slow because of. inexperienced contractors and the occurrence of
archeological finds.   The Volos component of  the project was completed  in
1985. That for Salonica is expected to be finalized in mid-1987. Overall,
the project would be completed about five and one half year later than
expected (paras. 3.02 and 3.03).
4.    The Loan was closed on June 29, 1984, while withdrawals continued until
the  end of  1984.   By  then,  US$15.1  million  had  been disbursed.   Of  the
remainder, US$1.9 milliod was cancelled upon closing, US$4.5 million was
cancelled in connection with two contracts awarded on a basis which did not
*       follow Bank guidelines, and US$14.5 million was cancelled at the request of
the Greek Government in April 1984 (paras. 3.04 and 3.05).
5.    Project costs at completion are currently projected at Dr. 10.8 billion,
equivalent to a 172Z overrun.  However, in terms of US dollars, total costs
are expected to be 11% less than estimated at appraised (para. 3.08).



- V. -
6.    As a result of the project, the Directorate of tie Ministry of Public
Works responsible for the design, appraisal and construction of water supply
and  sewerage  projects  have  been  considerably  strextgthened.   So  has  the
Supervision Directorate of the same Ministry (para. 4.02).
7.    Both SSA and VWSA have grown into capable organizations.  However, while
the latter adopted an accruals accounting system effective January 1985, the
former decided, contrary to appraisal assumptions, t;. continue to follow the
accounting procedures of the public sector and not to use external auditors
(para. 4.05 and 4.06).  SSA met its revenue covenant only after 1980, VWSA
after 1981 (para. 5.04).
8.    The project as executed is well-conceived and represents the least cost
solution (para. 7.01) The main objective of the project which was co carry
out a comprehensive reform of the sewerage sub-sector has been achieved (para.
7.03).
9.   The project confirms the importance of adequate project preparation and
consideration during appraisal of local implementation procedures and possible
measures to reduce delays (para. 8.02).



THE HELLENIC STATE
SALONICA A1iD VOLOS SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1345-GR)
PROJECT CONPLETION REPORT
Background
1.01     In municipal areas other than Athens and Salonica, large sewerage
systems had been designed and constructed by the Ministry of Public Works
(MPW)  assisted  by  private  consulting  engineers  and  financed  by  central
Government grants. Small systems had been constructed by the Ministry of the
Interior  or  the  municipalities.   The  operation and maintenance  of  these
systems had been the responsibility of the municipalities.  The development of
the sewerage subsector had failed to keep pace with the requirements of rapid
urbanization and industrialization because of inadequate technical standards
and pollution control policies, weak local and national institutions and
unsatisfactory financial policies and practices. The Government was aware of
these shortcomings and had requested Bank assistance to reorga1lize the
sewerage  subsector,  build  up  a  national  capability  in  the  planming
construction and supervision of sewerage systems and establish viable local
institutions able to ensure the efficient financial and technical management
of the subsector. The Bank project was considered a -ood vehicle for carrying
out these reforms.
The Project
1.02     The project comprised the final design and construction of priority
sewerage infrastructure works in Salonica and Volos, the strengthening of a
sewerage  peoject  planning  department  and  a  sewerage  works  supervision
department in the Ministry of Works, the establishment of a water and sewerage
authority in Volos, project-related studies and staff training. Although the
Salonica Sewerage Authority (SSA) had been created by law in December 1970, it
only became operational in early 1976 in the framework of the project.

1.03     The borrower was the Greek Government and the executing agency was
the Ministry of Public Works.   The new facilities, which are still under
construction (para. 3.03) will be taken over by the local severage authorities
who will be responsible for their operation and maintenance as well as for
future developments.
Project Financing
1.04     The Bank loan of US$ 36 million was intended to finance the  total
foreign exchange requirement of the project.  However, as US$19.9 million was
cancelled (para. 3.05), the amount disbursed is expected to finance only about
46% of the foreign exchange requirement or 15% of the project cost.  The
remainder is being financed by loans from the Greek Government.



Bank Role in the Sector
1.05     The irvolvement of the Bank in the wate3r supply and sewerage sector
has been limited to this project.  However, because of its pilot nature the
project has been a good vehicle to address broad sector reforms.  To date,
some forty municipalities have established autonomous entities similar to the
one created in Volos under the project. More are expected to follow.
[I. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin
2.01     Ia 1972 the Greek government called upon the Bank for assistance in
carrying out a reform of the sewerage sector. In response to this request the
Bank agreed to finance two out of six priority projects, one in Salonica and
one in Volos. These would serve as vehicles for this reform.
Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.02     The Bank and WHO assi.ted the Government in the preparation of the
project.   Feasibility  studies were carried out by Komis & Watson for the
Salonica sewerage system, OTME/Balfours for the Salonica treatment plant, and
Macheras Balasha-Jalon for the Volos sewerage system.  Oceanic surveys were
carried out by the Greek Institute of Oceanographic and Fishing Research
(IOKAE) of Athens.  Financial and institutional studies and industrial waste
water surveys were conducted by the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank
(ETVA) assisted by Arthur Anderson and Company. A Bank mission appraised the
project in February/March 1976.
Project Objective
2.03     The main objective o. the project was to help Greece to reorganize
the sewerage sector. This would be acLomplished through:
(a)  creation of a Wastewater Department within the MPW to serve as an
advisory and regulatory agency for the sector;
(b)  creation of a Project Appraisal Department within the MPW to review
the technical, economic and financial feasibility of water supply and
sewerage projects;
(c)  creation of semi-autonomous  water  supply  and  sewerage  authorities
with responsibility for design, eonstruction and operation of their
systems;
(d)  financirg of new water supply and sewerage projects by the central or
provincial governments through commercial type loans together with
the introduction of cost-relaced tariff policies; and



- 3 -
(e) strengthening of the capabilities of the Institute of Oceanographic
and Fishing Research (1OKAE) for surveying and monitoring fresh and
ocean waters.
This objective has been largely met (Chapter IV).
Project Description
2.04     The project consisted of two sub-projects, studies and training, as
follows:
(a)  Greater Salonica Sewerage Sub-Project
This sub-project was to be constructed during the period 1977-1981.
It i'cluded partial rehabilitation of the existing sewer network and
extensions of the network to the low-income residential areas, plus
the structures needed to intercept, treat and discharge into the
Axios  River  the  waste  waters  flowing  into  Salonica  Bay.   A
physicochemical system of treatment of waste waters was adopted
because biological trpatment, including stabilization ponds would not
be viable until the Government had established an effective program
for controlling the discharge of industrial liquid wastes and toxic
substances likely to inhibit biological processes. Specifically, the
sub-project included:
(i)     installation of about 65 km of secondary sewers,  17 km of
trunk and force mains, and three pumping stations to serve
the coastal area and the Lagadas and Esso industrial zones;
(ii)    installation of about 8 km of gravity interceptors, 1 km of
force mains, and three pumping stations to intercept the
trunk mains discharging into Salonica Bay;
(iii)   construction of about 25 km of the main interceptor between
White Tower and the Axios River;
(iv)    construction  of  a physicochemical  primary  treatment  plant
with an initial capacity of about 3.9 m3/second; and
(v)     purchase or equipment for sewer inspection and maintenance.
(b)  Greater Volos Sewerage Sub-Project
The proposed sub-project was to be constructed during the period
1977-1981.  It included  the infrastructure to serve the population
projected up to 1995, pre-treatment of the wastewater and all the
secondary sewer networks which could logistically be installed during
that five-year span. Specifically, the sub-project included:
(i)     installation of about 113 km of secondary sewers,  18 km of
trunk and force mains and five pumping stations;



- 4 -
(ii)    construction  of  a  pre-treatment  plant  with  an  initial
capacity-of about 0.44 m3/second;
(iii)   installation  of  a  collector  of  about  4  km,  to  carry
wastewater from industrial estate to the pre-treatment plant;
and
(iv)    construction of a temporary effluent pumping station, an 8.1
km final interceptor and a 0.7 km ocean outfall to discharge
the pre-treated wastewater into the Pagasitikos Gulf.
(C) Studies
At the request of Government studies and surveys were designed to
provide not only the data required for the Salonica and Volos
sewerage projects but also to develop guidelines and techniques to be
employed in other cities. These studies and surveys consisted of:
*i)     feasibility studies for the Mega  Emvolon  sewerage  system,
which would serve the southeastern part of the Salonica
metropolitan area and would be constructed by SSA as part of
its  future  investment  program.   These  studies  aimed  to
establish the first pilot project in Greece on the use of
wastewater effluents for irrigation;
(ii)    industrial wastewater surveys in Salonica and Volos aimed at
establishing country-wide procedures on industrial wastewater
management;
(iii)   oceanographic studies of the Thermaikos and Pagasitikos Gulfs
designed to establish country-wide procedures for monitoring
and evaluation of ocean water quality, including:
- monitoring of the receiving waters once the proposed
sewerage projects enter operation; and
-  establishment of L mathematical model to forecast the cost
of   treatment   for   different   types   of   industrial
ilevelopments and for various criteria of water quality;
(iv)    a review of accounting, financial control and tariff systems
of the Salonica Water Authority (SWA), Salonica Sewerage
Authority (SSA), and Volos Water and Sewerage Authority
(VWSA), with a view to implementing systems more appropriate
to  the  operations   of   autonomous   water   and   sewerage
authorities throughout the country.
(d) Trai
The project also included provisions for training of senior staff of
the Wastewater and Project Appraisal Departments of MPW and selected



- 5 -
senior staff of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) through short visits
to sewerage organizations and systems abroad.
Negotiations
2.05     Negotiations took place in Washington from October 21 through 24,
1976.  Because of changes in project scheduling and design, at the request of
the Government, the loan was increased from $33 to $36 million. Also at the
request of the Government, the application of the tariff covenant was changed
from 1978 and 1979 for Salonica and Volos respectively to no later than three
months following the signing of their subsidiary agreements with the
Government,  in the event  October  1976  and  June  1979  respectively.   The
Government also requested that the consultants for the accounting and
financial control studies also review the tariff structures of the various
authorities to assist in making recommendations on improvements thereto, and
this provision was added to the project.
Loan Covenants
2.06     A loan agreement was entered into between the Bank and the Hellenic
State on February 3, 1977. The major covenants covered (i) the organization
and administration of the Wastewater Department and Project Appraisal
Department of the Water and Wastewater Directorate of MPW's Hydraulics
Division (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(a) and Schedule 5); (ii) subsidiary
agreements between the borrower and SSA and VWSA (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(c); (iii) the provision of funds by the Government to SSA and VWSA to
finance consumers' connection charges and contributions to construction costs
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(d); (iv) the staffing of SSA and VWSA (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.03(a); (v) the employment of engineering consultants
satisfactory to the Bank for the further preparation of the Salonica and Volos
sub-projects  (Loan  Agreement,  Section  3.03(b);  (vi)  the  employment. of
consultants to carry out the sub-projects and the studies (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.04); (vii) the audit of SSA's and VWSA's accounts and financial
statements (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03(b); (viii) the introduction of
appropriate accounting systems in SSA and VWSA as recommended by the studies
included in the project (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03(c); (ix) the transfer of
the new facilities and related assets and liabilities to SSA and VWSA (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.05); (x) cash flow covenants (Loan Agreement, Section
4.08 through 4.10); and (xi) debt service coverage covenants (Loan Agreement,
Section 4.11).
2.07     A special condition of effectiveness in addition to the ratification
of the loan by the Greek Government was the provision of evidence satisfactory
to the Bank that eitier of the following sets of events had occurred:
(a)  with respect to SSA:  (i) SSA's jurisdiction,  responsibilities  and
powers had been extended and modified in a manner satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Bank; and (ii) the Salonica Agreement had been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and was legally binding upon the
Borrower and SSA, or



-6-
(b)  with respect to VWSO:   (i) VWSO had been established in a manner
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank; and (ii) the Volos
Agreement had been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and was
legally binding upon the Borrower and VWSO.
2.08     The loan covenants  were  comprehensive  and adequately  covered  the
requirements for project implementation.  Most major covenants were complied
with, albeit some with substantial delays.  However,  contrary to appraisal
assumptions, SSA has decided to continue to follow the accounting procedures
of the public sector, i.e. on a cash receipt and disbursement basis, and not
to use external auditors (para. 4.05).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Conditions of Effectiveness and Disbursement
3.01     In Greece  all loan agreements with the Bank must be approved by
Parliamant. At appraisal it was expected that Parliamentary approval would be
rapidly  secured.   However,  general  elections  and  complex  bureaucratic
procedures caused the loan agreement to be ratified only in April 1978, almost
15 months after loan signature.  The condition of effectiveness relating to
SSA's and VWSO's establishment and subsidiary agreements (para 2.07) was first
satisfied by SSA and the loan declared effective on November 30, 1978. The
execution of the Volos agreement remained a condition of disbursement, which
was satisfied on June 30, 1979.
Revisions
3.02     At the time of appraisal, in February 1976, only preliminary designs
and feasibility studies had been available, and the project had had to include
the  preparation of final  designs.   Consultants  were  thus  commissioned  to
prepare the final designs for the sewer systems of Volos and Salonica in April
and May 1977 respectively. The final design for Volos followed approximately
the preliminary design, and no revisions of importance were necessary.  It was
substantially  completed  by  mid-1979.   However,  major  revisions  became
necessary for Salonica because (i) the site of the treatment plant proved to
be unsuitable as a seismic analysis indicated the likelihood of soil
lique:action in the event of earthquakes; a new site was found only after
extensive soil investigations; and (ii) the construction method for the main
collector, which was to be constructed in an open trench, was changed to a
tunnel to avoid insurmountable problems in streets already crowded with all
types of conduits.   The greater depth of the tunnel, however,   allowed  a
larger area of the town to be connected by gravity. Other revisions concerned
the lining of the upper part of the sewers with PVC -- which is resistant to
sewer gases - rather than brick which, however, was retained for the lower
part.   These  changes  caused  a delay  of  about  two years  in  the  bidding
process. The construction of secondary sewers and the purchase of maintenance
equipment were dropped from the project.   These are to be undertaken with
local financing after completion of the other elements of the project.



-7-
Proect Implementation
3.03     The  Project  was  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works.
Implementation was slow from the start, and completion is currently estimated
around mid-0987, five and a half years later than originally foreseen.   The
forecast and actual construction schedules are shown in Annex 1. The original
schedule was overly optimistic particularly with regards to the preparation of
the final design and the bidding procedures.  The preparation of the final
designs took much longer than anticipated because of lack of basic key
information and changes in project description (para 3.02).  The final design
for the Salonica treatment plant was only available in May 1982 and related
bid documents agreed upon in early 1983.   These delays were compounded by
lengthy approval processes in several committees, and the Greek procurement
regulations which mandate that no contract be awardei if the lowest evaluated
bid is higher than the government estimate. As a result, construction started
only in 1981.  Construction progress was also slow because of inexperienced
contractors, the purchase and importation of specialized tunnel construction
equipment and the occurrence of archaeological finds during excavation.
3.04     By the time of the original closing date, June 30, 1982, the project
construction had barely started. Two extensions were granted up to June 29,
1984, for contracts awarded prior January 1, 1984.  At the same time the
disbursement percentage for civil works was increased from 242 to 36% to
reflect the latest estimate of the foreign exchange component, which had
increased due to devaluation of the drachma from the time of appraisal at a
rate exceeding the difference between Greek and world inflation rates.
3.05     The loan was closed on June 29, 1984, while withdrawals continued
until the end of 1984. By then US$15.1 million had been disbursed out of the
original  loan  of  US$36  million.   Of  the  remainder,  US$4.5  million  was
cancelled because procurement methods did not follow the Bank's guidelines
(para. 3.07), US$14.5 million was cancelled at the request of the Government
in April 1984, and a further US$1.9 million was cancelled upon closing of the
loan.
Reportin
3.06     In April  1981,  the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) began to submit
quarterly progress reports which covered the physical aspects of project
progress and associated financial commitments.
Procurement
3.07 All contracts, except five, were procured on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.  Of these five,
cwo small civil works contracts for the preparation and protection of the new
treatment  plant  site  were  procured  locally;  two  were  not  procured  in
conformity with the Bank guidelines (one contract was awarded to the second
lowest evaluated bidder, and the other was procured on the basis of bid
documents in the Greek language which were not cleared by the Bank); and the
last was awarded after the cutoff date agreed between Government and the Bank



- 8 -
for Bank financing.  All contracts were won by Greek contractors except one
equipment contract valued at about US$700,000, which was awarded to a French
company.
Prolect Cost
3.08     The total project cost at completion is currently projected at Dr
10.8 billion.   This includes Dr 5.2 billion of actual expenditures as of
December 31, 1984, and an estimated Dr 5.6 billion required to complete the
project.   This  represents  a  potential  cost overrun of 1721 compared with
appraisal  estimates.   Expressed  in US  dollars,  however,  total  costs  are
expected to reach US$101.3 million as compared with US$113 million at
appraisal, or a cost underrun of 11%. Details are given in Annex 2. The cost
overrun in local currency is mainly due to longer project implementation and
higher inflation than anticipated.

Performance of Consultant. Contractors and the Executing Agency
3.09     The performance of the consultants and contractors was satisfactory.
That of the executing agency was also satisfactory with regards to project
supervision. However, because of staff constraints, lack of clear allocation
of responsibilities, and complicated administrative procedures, the agency's
performance fell short of expectations with regards to project preparation.
-' Estimated Comoletion: Mid-1987.



IV. INSTITUTIONAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Institutional Reform
4.01     The main objective of the project was to help Greece to reorganize
the  sewerage  sector  (para.  2.03).   As  explained  in  this  Chapter,  this
objective was broadly met.
Ministry of Public Works (MPW)
4.02     The reorganization of MPW discussed during project preparation, was
approved by Parliament on August 16, 1977, and implemented soon afterwards.
The Directorates responsible for sewerage project design and project
appraisal, and for the construction of water supply and sewerage works were
strengthened. Although still understaffed the Project Design Directorate now
routinely  prepares  sewerage  projects  designs.    The  Project  Supervision
Directorate  currently  supervises  all  sewerage  projects  and  needs  the
assistance of consultants only in the case of very complex structures such as
treatment plants.
Salonica Sewerae Authorty
4.03Although created in December 1970, SSA did not start its operation until
January 1976, in the framework of the Bank project.   It operates under the
tutelage of MPW. After almost ten years of operation, the authority has grown
into a capable institution with a dedicated staff of 30 engineers and higher
level personnel, 60 support staff and 150 laborers. SSA's Organization Chart
appears in Annex 3. The recommendations of the management consultants (Price
Waterhouse) published in 1980 (para 2.04c(iv) on accounting and financial
matters, have been implemented with the exception of an accruals system of
accounts.   The prevailing Government accounting system has been maintained.
In the technical area, SSA is performing well, house connections and
extensions to the sewage collection system are being constructed by its own
labor force and the institution is preparing to take over the project
facilities. For this purpose, five of its engineers are receiving on-the-job
training with the MPW Supervis.on Unit.
Volos Water Supply and Sewerage Authority
4.04     VWSA's enabling legislation was passed in March 1979,  its  internal
regulations were approved in May 1981, and its first General Manager was
appointed in January 1982. VWSA operates under the tutelage of the Ministry
of Interior. Its Organization Chart appears in Annex 4. Until 1985 VWSA was
responsible only for water supply, although it had already launched a campaign
to connect all city buildings to the new sewerage system.  In the short span
of its existence, VWSA has developed into a capable organization.
4.05     The creation of VWSA was part of a pilot program for the development
of regional water and sewerage authorities.   That  the experiment  has been
judged successful can be seen by the fact that some forty authorities
patterned after VWSA have already been created.



- 10 -
Accounts and Audits
4.05     SSA is governed by the Accounting Procedure for legal entities.  This
procedure calls for the Ministry of Finance to exercise financial control over
the administration of  the Authority's  capital and property.   The Authority
prepares an analytical statement of cash receipts and disbursements and
forwards it with supporting documents and vouchers to an audit office of the
Ministry of Finance.  The Salonica local authorities are satisfied iith this
arrangement and do not intend to hire independent auditors as agreed in the
Loan Agreement.
4.06     In Volos,  the  accourting system was changed effective January  1,
1985, to provide the essential features of accruals accounting.  Acc unts for
1979 through 1984 have been audited by independent auditors.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     The  appraisal  assumption  that  SSA  and  VWSA would  adopt accruals
accounting was not realized during the 1976-84 period (paras. 4.05 and 4.06).
Neither were the assumptions that debt would be assumed as incurred by SSA and
VWSA or that depreciation would be booked. The actual Income Statements and
Balance Sheets given in Annex 5 were developed from existing cash receipt-
disbursement  records.   However,  it  has  not  been  possible  to  construct
meaningful cash flows.
5.02     At appraisal, internal inflation was projected at 10% for 1976, 9%
for 1977 and 8% thereafter, which is the equivalent of slightly over 8% per
year in the 1976-84 period.   Actual inflation as measured by the consumer
price index was more than twice the appraisal figure, at an average of 19% per
year.
5.03     At Salonica, revenues grew at an average of 34% and expenses at 28%
in  the  1976-84  period  (appraisal  38%  and  25%  respectively).   Comparable
figures  for  Volos  show  average  annual  growth  of  revenues  and  expenses
(adjusted for depreciation) of 22% and 19% respectively (appraisal 11%. and 12%
respectively).   In .1984,  SSA's  working  ratio  reached  74%  and  VWSA'S  82%
(appraisal 66% and 73% respectively).
5.04     The Loan Agreement called for SSA and VWSA to generate net revenues
after covering operation and maintenance costs, depreciation and interest
expense  equivalent   to  4%  of  net  fixed  assets   in  operations   plus
work-in-progress up until 1981, and 2% and 1.5% respectively afterwards.  SAA
met this covenant only after 1980, VWSA after 1981.
5.05     At the end of 1984, Salonica had a ratio of debt to debt plus equity
of 49% (appraisal 41%) while Volos had a ratio of 27% (appraisal 45%). Much
of the debt incurred for the Volos project was assumed only upon completion of
the project in 1985.

VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.01     A good rapport has existed between the Bank and the various project
implementation agencies, including the Ministry of National Economy (formerly
Ministry of Coordination), the Ministry of Public Works, the Volos Water and
Sewerage Authority, the Salonica Sewerage Authority and the Ministry of Works
Supervision Units in Volos and Salonica. The Bank actively assisted project
preparation, and was instrumental in the creation of VWSA as well as in the
general reorganization of the sewerage subsector.
6.02 The Bank's supervision efforts were considerable, with 18 missions
carried out in a seven-year period.  These missions were well balanced and
provided continuity and necessary expertise and guidance.   In addition, two
country  project   implementation   reviews,   organized  between  high   level
governmental staff and Bank management, discussed project-related issues. The
Bank was flexible in agreeing to modification in the project description, in
extending the closing date from June 1982, to June 1984, and in increasing the
disbursement percentage for civil works from 24% to 36% to bring it in line
with updated assessment of foreign exchange requirements.  Nevertheless,  it
would appear that Bank appraisal of the project was premature and should have
been postponed (as required under current policies) until final designs were
available.
VW. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Least Cost Solutions
7.01     The quality of project related studies has been good.  The project as
executed is well conceived and represents the least cost solution.   Actual
project  costs  could  have  been  lower  by  a  more  expeditious  project
implementation.
Project Benefits
7.02     At appraisal it was held that the minimum estimate of the benefits of
sewage collection and disposal could not be derived from customers' observed
willingness to pay since (a) for reasons of public health, financial viability
and orderly development, consumers will be required to convert to the sewerage
systems, thus interfering with the free expression of the value which they
place upon the systems, and (b) the surcharge on water which consumers
currently pay for sewerage services may reflect the additional amount (i.e.,
the consumers surplus) which they are willing to pay for water.  The same
conditions prevail at present.
7.03     The  main  objective  of  the  project,  which  was  to  carry  out  a
comprehensive  reform of  the sewerage subsector, has been achieved.  At th.-
central government level, capability in sewerage project design, appraisal and
supervision has been developed in the reorganized Ministry of Public Works.
In Salonica, the sewerage authority that existed at the time of appraisal has
been strengthened in the framework of the project and is now managing the
sewerage  system  of  greater  Salonica  in  a  satisfactory  manner.   A  new



- 12 -
financially viable Water and Sewerage Authority has been created in Volos and
is now ready to take on its new responsibilities in managing, planning and
expanding the sewerage system in the Greater Volos urban area.  Furthermore,
this authority has been used as a model to establish similar institut:ons in
other urban areas.   Both institutions are also  responsible  for  industrial
wastewater  collection  and  pollution  control.   The  implementation  of  the
physical components of the project in the two cities has been delayed (para.
3.03), but all benefits inherent to a well planned sewage collection and
disposal system based on modern technology is well on the way to be realized.
Vrff. CONCLUSIONS
8.01     In conclusion, the project has been successful in accomplishing its
main objectives, namely: to serve as a pilot for the institutional development
of regional water and sewerage authorities as well as a vehicle for improving
national  expertise  in  industrial  wastewater  management,  operations  of
wastewater treatment facilities and water pollution control.
Lessons Learned
8.02     The project confirms the importance of adequate project preparation
(para. 3.02) and the need for a realistic assessment of the time involved in
the use of local procedures and consideration as to whether any measures could
be taken to expedite these procedures (para. 3.03).
