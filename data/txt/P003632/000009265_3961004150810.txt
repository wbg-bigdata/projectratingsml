MEMORANDUN AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE INTIRNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to China for SDR 35.3
million (equivalent to US$50 million), on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 35 years, to hell finance an Environmental Technical
Assistance Project. The proceeds of the Development Credit would be onlent
to the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) for 20 years, including a 5-year grace period, at
a fixed annual interest rate of one percent. NEPA would in turn relend SDR
4.0 million (equivalent to US$S.6 million) to the industrial enterprises
participating in the cleaner production pilot demonstration subproject at 7
percent per annum, for maturities up to 10 years and grace periods up to 3
years. The enterprises would bear the foreign exchange risk
2.        Background.  China's population of over 1.1 billion renders per
capita holdings of farmland, grassland, forest and water well below world
average figures. At present, environmental pollution and ecological
degradation are serious. Water pollution from untreated municipal
wastewater and industrial effluents, coupled with severe water shortages in
northern China, pose the most severe problem and the one that most directly
affects human health. Most wastewater is discharged into rivers, lakes and
oceans without any treatment. A great number of large and medium-sized
cities are in urgent need of improved water supplies. Excessive
exploitation of groundwater has led to an aggravation of water shortages.
Heavy air pollution from airborne particulates and sulfur dioxide has been
found in most large and medium-sized cities. Few countries are so
dependent on coal, and atmospheric emissions in China are largely due to
coal burning, primarily in the industrial sector. Most urban domestic
garbage and industrial solid wastes receive no treatment. Soil erosion,
soil salinization, deforestation, desertification, damage to wetlands and
grasslands, and diminishing wildlife habitats have resulted, in a trend
covering many centuries, in a severe and serious decrease in China's
natural ecosystems.
3.        Although China had made notable accomplishments in public
sanitation and flood control, its overall record in environmental
management before 1978 was very weak. During the last ten years, however,
China has made significant progress in environmental protection policies
and programs. It has set up an institutional and policy framework for
environmental protection, established comprehensive and strict pollution
guidelines (including a system of pollution levies and effluent fees) and,
since 1984, required environmental assessments for most public investments.
The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), established in 1982,
is the institution primarily responsible for setting national policies,
standards, and regulatory overview. Implementation and enforcement are
mainly the responsibility of the vast network of provincial, municipal and
local environmental protection bureaus (EPBs). Every line ministry also
has an environmental department. In addition, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS) has a large network of research institutes, of which more
than a dozen now focus on environment and ecology. As a result of these
measures, there are indications that China has made progress in addressing



-2 -
its environmental problems and in reducing the rate of environmental
degradation in some regions of the country; however, as in most countries,
the implementation of environmental policies and standards has not been
uniform, and the impacts of economic policies and very rapid growth have
not always been conducive to sound environmeutal management.
4.        Lessons from Previous Bank/tDA Involvement.  While this is the
first technical assistance project in China focused on the environment, the
Bank Group has financed technical assistance and projRct preparation
activities in other sectors. Lessons learned from the slower-than-
projected disbursement of earlier multi-purpose technical assistance
projects have been incorporated into the design of the present project. An
important feature of this project is that most of the sub-projects have
been fully prepared and appraised before the expected approval of the IDA
credit. This has been possible due to the high level of commitment by NEPA
and CAS during project preparation and the substantial foreign expertise
obtained during project preparation, especially from the Danish
Environmental Protection Agency, the Industry and Environment Program
Activity Center of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences' LTER (Long Term Ecological Research)
Program (most of which has been financed from consultant trust funds
provided by the governments of Canada, Denmar'k, Japan, the Netherlands and
Norway). Project management arrangements in NEPA have benefitted from the
experience that NEPA has gained through a small technical assistance
program financed under the Japan Grant Facility and CAS has gained similar
experience under the Bank-assisted Key Studies Project (Credit 2210-CHA).
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The Bank's Environmental
Strategy Paper (Report No. 9669-CHA) and China's draft Environmental Action
Plan have provided the basis for joint Government and Bank action on: (a)
the formulation of long-term environmental protection and natural resource
conservation policies and k~rograms; and (b) immediate investments that
would cause improvement in the short term. A planned multiyear program of
World Bank environmental assistance is proposed to include: (a)
environmental sector studies to provide the analyses necessary for
formulating policy, regulatory and institutional action plans, and
investment programs for specific problems; (b) technical assistance to
strengthen those institutions in China dealing with environmental and
ecological matters; and (c) an environmental investment lending program
(two t; three projects per year) to support appropriate investments,
primarily at the provincial and municipal level, to further these
objectives and to produce measurable (and monitorable) results in improving
the efficiency of resource use and in reducing pollution and degradation of
natural resources. Among the environmental projects envisaged for the next
thres years, in addition to the project described below, are: several
aimed at comprehensive management of urban pollution, a forestry project,
several provincial projects on agricultural development of marginal lands
and management of watersheds, and industrial projects to phase out the use
of substances that deplete the ozone layer and to help reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.
6.        Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to support
agreed environmental objectives through the provision of technical assist-
ance to strengthen the capacities and selected policies and programs of two
institutions of national importance in China's environment sector, NEPA and



- 3 -
CAS. More specifically, it addresses identified needs that emerged from
the Environmental Strategy Paper and its review with the Government. Those
needs are: (a) to improve coordination of environmental monitoring and
ecological research; (b) to promote cleaner industrial production,
pollution prevention and waste minimization technologies; (c) to enhance
economic policy instruments for pollution control, especially the pollution
levy system; and (d) to strengthen the Chinese system of environmental
assessments (EA). Another objective is to improve interagency and
interministerial coordination for improved environmental management
(component (b)(iv) described below).
7.        Project DescriRtion.  The project would consist of three main
components (figures in parenthesis represent respective IDA credit resource
allocations):
(a) CAS Ecological Research and Monitoring (USS20 million)
(i)  CAS began in 1980 to design a Chinese Ecosystem Research Network
(CERN) to strengthen long-term ecological research in China and
to generate scientifically-valid ecological information that
could be used for sustainable natural resource management and
agricultural development. CERN would link and upgrade existing
selected ecological r.search field stations and institutes. The
sub-project for the support of CERN (US$15.5 million) will
provide specialized scientific instruments and computer hardware
and software to upgrade research capacity and facilitate data
collection, analyses, and exchange of information. It will also
provide technical assistance in the design and management of the
network (especially in the areas of scientific database and
information management) and training of staff at the various CAS
field stations and research institutes. An inter-agency data
management committee would also be set up, inter-alia, to review
and recommend policies and protocols to facilitate the
transmission and sharing of CERN data within CAS and with other
agencies and ministries.
(ii) CAS has also recently set up a Biodiversity Research and
Information Management (BRIM) program, to promote and strengthen
research and generate better information on China's rich
biological resources. The sub-project for BRIM (US$4.5 million)
would, through provision of technical assistance, training,
equipment, and facilities, assist in establishing a biodiversity
information data network to facilitate exchange of information
between various CAS research institutes and field stations;
strengthen technical capabilities to conduct field surveys and
inventories; enhance capacity for ex-situ propagation and
maintenance of genetic materials; and facilitate analysis and
dissemination of research results to scientists and decision
makers.
(b)  NEPA Technical Assistance Program (USS25 million)
(i)  Two subprojects (US$1.8 million) would provide technical
assistance, training and equipment to strengthen management
capabilities of NEPA and its provincial network and associated



- 4 -
research institutes, including a subproject focusing on the
recently created Environment and Economic Policy Research
Center. A training unit has been set up and periodic training
needs assessments will be carried out within NEPA. A third
subproject (US$1.7 million) would provide technical assistance
to China's university level envirormental education sytem,
including a study which will review and make recommendations for
strengthening graduate and post-graduate environmental degree
programs.
(ii) Three subprojects (US$8.7 million) providing technical
assistance, training and equipment to: (a) improve and expand
NEPA's computerized environmental monitoring and information
gystems at the provincial and municipal level (including
preparation of a strategic environmental information resources
management plan); (b) expand and upgrade China's global
environmental monitoring system (GEMS) which is a part of the
WHO/UNEP global network; and (c) upgrade the national
enmvironmental analysis and measurement standards (reference
material standards). Steering committees will be set up to
review the functions and operations of the systems and to make
changes as needed during the implementation of the project,
particularly in regard to management capacity and utilization -f
the networks.
(iii)  Waste minimization and cleaner production grograms for industry
(USS6.3 million). This subproject would support the nascent
cleaner production efforts underway in China. Its goal is
capacity and capability building to develop and expand Chinese
cleaner production expertise. The subproject would have four
major parts: (a) institution building (NEPA, industrial
ministries and industrial design institutes); (b) training; (c)
pilot demonstration projects (US$5.6 million); and (d) a policy
review (including a post-evaluation of the demonstration
projects). The work under this subprojact would also build
Chinese capacity to assist in the preparation of cleaner
production components under Bank-financed industry and urban
environment projects in China over the next three to five years.
UNEP assisted in preparing and will be involved in supervising
the subproject through its Industry and Environment Program
Activity Center.
(iv)  A line of credit to undertake specific environMental and
ecological studies (USS6.5 million). Studies already pre-
identified would address agreed prio-.ity areas, including
environmentally sound agriculture, rural industry pollution
control, strengthening China's pollution levy system, motor
vehicle pollution control, hazardous and toxic waste mœnagement,
pollution control in chemical industries, and interagency
coordination of ecological monitoring.
(c) Environ_ental Impact Assessment System (USS5.0 million). This
component would consist of: (i) a line of credit to assist in the
financing of EAs of World Bank-assisted projects; (ii) a program and
line of credit to develop new EA approaches (e.g., regional and
sector EAs); and (iii) a training program for the Chinese



4-
institutions responsible for carrying out EAs or administering the EA
system.
8.        The attached Technical Annex describes in greater detail the
project's overall institutional context and detailed features of the
components and sub-projects, as well as the procurement, disbursement and
management arrangements. Retroactive financing of up to US$600,000 for
expenditures incurred after December 31, 1992 would be provided in respect
of consultant services and training. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
9.        Project IMRlementation and Manazement.  CAS and NEPA would
separately administer their respective components and NEPA would administer
the EA component. NLPA, with the assistance of the State Planning
Commission (SPC), would review and ipprove proposals under the line of
credit for environmental studies and recommend them for final approval by
the Association. A Chinese investment bank would be contracted by NEPA to
be the financial agency responsible for the economic and financial
appraisal of the enterprises selected to participate under the cleaner
production subproject. Both CAS and NEPA have created Amits for
administering their respective components and for liaising with the
functional departments that would be responsible for the implementation of
the sub-projects. CAS and NEPA have prepared project plan documents or
reports for each subproject that describe in detail the objectives, scope
and content of the subproject, including training programs, implementation
schedules, and tables of monitorable performance indicators. CAS and NEPA
would carry out annual reviews of their work plans and training programs
under the project, and a joint review with the Association of overall
project implementation would be carried out every two years. Progress of
the project will be monitored by a task manager in the China and Mongolia
Department, Environment and Human Resources Division, assisted by staff and
consultants specialized in subjects included in the subprojects. In
addition, arrangements have been made with UNEP's Industry and Environment
Activity Program Center to maintain close involvement with the implementa-
tion (including a series of project launch workshops during the first six
months) of the cleaner industrial production subproject as a part of its
overall program in China.
10.       Project Sustainabilit.  Project sustainability critically
depends on the commitment of NEPA and CAS, the caliber of the counterpart
staff and the success of the training programs. All of the project
proposals were generated and strongly endorsed by NEPA and GAS. Their
counterpart staff worked together with a wide variety of foreign experts
early in the project design, resulting in an advanced level of project
preparation and subprojects that are integrated into the on-going long-term
programs of each institution. Considerable preparation has gone into the
design of training programs that will help develop durable local capacity
in NEPA and CAS. Both NEPA and CAS will provide substantial amounts of
counterpart funding, including equipment budgets that include adequate
provisions for spares and maintenance.
11.       Agreed Acton. Assurances were obtained at negotiations on the
following: (a) sub-project appraisal criteria for the cleaner industrial
production demonstration sub-projects, including on-lending of credit
proceeds to the industrial enterprises on terms and conditions acceptable



to the Association (repayment periods based on the projected cash flow of
the entities and an interest rate of no less than 7%); (b) on-lending from
the Government to NEPA and CAS would be at 1%, with a 20-year repayment
period, including 5 years grace period; (c) criteria for selection,
processing and approval under the two subprojects financing environmental
and ecological studies and environmental impact assessments; (d) terms of
reference for the environmental information resources management plan, the
strategic study of environmental education programs at the university
level, the study on the economics of environmentally sound agriculture,
the rural industry pollution control study and the pollution levy system
review; (a) completion of the detailed terms of reference for the seven
pre-identified studies by December 31, 1993; (f) final revisions to the
subproject plan documents by November 30, 1993 and (g) a review by CAS and
NEPA of their training programs by September 30, 1994 (about one year into
project implementation) in order to identify new training needs or to make
revisions in the existing training programs. There are no special
conditions of effectiveness. A condition of disbursement for the cleaner
industrial production demonstration component is that NEPA would select a
financial agency from among ft,ur Chinese investment banks that are
currently providing financial intermediation services under other Bank-
assisted projects and enter into a financial agency agreement on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Association.
12.       Proiect Benefits.  The primary benefit of the project would be
to strengthen the institutional capacity at the national level for
effective development and implementation of environmental policies and
programs and at the regional and field level for conducting research to
generate scientific data in support of national and regional natural
resource policies and programs.
13.       Risks.  There are risks of delay in implementation with a
project that has multiple components involving several different entities,
none of which has extensive experience with Bank procedures and
requirements. However, the establishment of project management units
should minimize these risks. Also most sub-projects have been fully
identified and appraised and detailed administrative arrangements have been
made by NEPA and CAS for the individual sub-projects.
14.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proDosed credit.

CHINA - ENVIRON-MENTAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
1.        This project aims to strengthen the policies, programs, and
institutional capacity of two of China's most important national level
organizations in the environment sector: the National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA), which has regulatory responsibility for environ-
mental and ecological matters in China, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) which conducts most of the country's ecological research. Most of
the specific components of the project emanated from the work and recommen-
dations of the Bank's 1992 China Environmental Strategy Paper (Report No.
9669-CHA) and the Government's draft Environmental Action Plan. Most of
the Bank-assisted environmental program in China focuses on specific
regional and local environmental problems, institutions and projects;
however, the proposed project is primarily aimed at national policies and
programs, and institutional framework. Assistance in the preparation of
this project was provided by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency,
UNEP's Industry and Environment Program Activity Center, the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences, and bilateral trust funds from Canada, Denmark, Japan,
the Netherlands and Norway.
Chinese Academy of Sciences' Ecological Research and Monitoring Technical
Assistance Program
2.        The CAS component is divided into two subprojects--the Chinese
Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) and Biodiversity Research and Information
Management (BRIM) program. The overall objective of both subprojects is to'
improve the knowledge and understanding of China's biological resources and
ecological environment by upgrading long-term research, improving data
collection and management for monitoring environmental changes, and linking
research results to the decision-making process. Since these two compo-
nents are complementary, linkages have been made in terms of coordinating
activities through shared memberships or. CERN and BRIM committees and
scientific advisory panels, sharing data management training and technical
assistance and conducting collaborative research at field stations.
3.        Objectives.  The main objective of CERN is to strengthen CAS's
long-term ecological research capability by integrating and upgrading
existing research stations/institutes into a national research network in
order to produce valid ecological data for policy-makers. Such data will
improve the understanding of human impacts on the environment and contrib-
ute to the development of sustainable systems of natural resource manage-
ment and agriculture development.

4.        The BRIM component aims to enhance the ability of CAS to gener-
ate, manage, and disseminate information relevant for biodiversity conser-
vation and sustainable management of biological resources. BRIM will
generate necessary information for management of endangered flora and
fauna, conservation of genetic diversity, and sustainable management of
natural ecosystems. It will also provide information on biodiversity and
biological resources for key policy-makers, planners, and the public in
formats appropriate for incorporating biodiversity conservation into land
management programs and policies at local, regional, and national levels.
5.        Descrigtion.  CERN is a long-term (i.e., 25 years) CAS research
project. During the first five years which the project would support, CERN
would focus on: the establishment and development of a nation-wide research
network comprising 29 field research stations, 4 subcenters, and 1 synthe-
sis center, and development of a data management system for systematic
collection of information related to natural resource development and
management. The subproject would finance construction or upgrading of
research facilities; purchases of equipment and scientific instruments,
particularly for data storage and processing; and provision of technical
and research management training and technical assistance.
6.        BRIM consists of six subcomponents:  (a) establishment of a
national network for management and exchange of biodiversity data; (b)
strengthening of national and regional institutes to conduct field surveys
of flora and fauna and to maintain relevant museum and herbarium refer-
ence/research collections; (c) improvement of national and regional
institutes to conserve rare and endangered plant and animal species through
ex-situ propagation and maintenance of germplasm (e.g., seed banks); (d)
identification and establishment of pilot studies in restoration of
degraded natural landscapes and long-term studies of natural and managed
succession; (e) enhancement of genetics research centers to store and
maintain valuabla genetic material; and (f) analysis and dissemination of
research results to decision-makers and scientists. The subproject would
finance some infrastructure development, particularly at research stations,
purchases of equipment and scientific instruments in support of field
research and surveys, and training and technical assistance.
7.        Training.  Since ecological/biodiversity research and data
collection, management, and analysis are relatively new fields in China,
the success of this subproject will depend largely on development of human
resources to carry-out the tasks. Training is needed not only in special-
ized technical fields but also in management of scientific research and
data. Some 19 percent of the component funds has been set aside for
training and technical assistance. The vast majority of staff (approxi-
mately 1,700) in both CERN and BRIM will participate in some form of   -
training activity throughout the life of the project; some for repeated
training, particularly in the area of data management. Approximately 85
percent of the training will be done in-country; the rest will be overseas
training of up to one year duration. In order to accommodate unforeseen

Page 3 of 17
needs and problems that will develop as the implementation of the sub-
projects.progress, Training and Technical Assistance Working Groups for
BRIM and CERN have been established to continuously review, monitor,
evaluate and, if appropriate, modify training and technical assistance
schedules. These two Working Groups will assure the continuing quality of
activities, encourage cooperation, work to avoid duplication of effort, and
establish joint activities such as workshops, training programs and
scientific meetings when appropriate.
8.        Implementation Arrangements.  Both CERN and BRIM have developed
similar organization and management structures headed by a decision-making
body (e.g., CERN and BRIM Science Committees). A secretariat under each
deals with day-to-day administration and coordination, including preparing
annual work plans. This structure will continue to exist after the
project. The Science Committees, which have shared memberships between
CERN and BRIM, will also coordinate the two subprojects. CAS's Office of
External Financing (OEF) will manage procurement, accounting, and disburse-
ment of IDA funds, dispatch of Chinese scholars for training abroad,
procurement of foreign technical assistance, and submission of annual
reports to the Bank. Ia addition, there is a Scientific Advisory Committee
that is composed of eleven members, among which are two foreign experts and
experts from the State Science and Technology Commission, Ministry of
Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry and CAS. They will meet at least
annually and advise on research agendas and methods, the training programs,
and data sharing among ministries and agencies.
NEPA Technical Assistance Program
Institutional Management CaRacity Building SubRrojects
9.        Objectives.  This part of NEPA's component of the project
consists of three subprojects whose principal objectives are: (a) to
strengthen the management capabilities of NEPA and its provincial EPB
network and associated research institutes; (b) to strengthen the recently
created Environment and Economic Policy Research Center; and (c) to
strengthen China's university level environmental education system.
10.       DescriRtion.  The first subproject will assist NEPA in strength-
ening its institut!onal capabilities through a program of training needs
assessments (TNAs), staff training and improvements in the training centers
and training of trainers. The TNAs would be carried out by a Training Work
Group set up in the Department of Institutional and Personnel Management.
The Training Work Group was established before appraisal and conducted a
pilot TNA which was reviewed at appraisal. The scope of the TNA program
would be environmental protection staff at central, provincial and munici-
pal levels. TNAs would be conducted for several NEPA Departments at the
central level, one provincial EPB and one municipal EPB. NEPA's Training
Work Group would assist in the establishment of Training Work Groups in the



- 18 -
Page 4 of 17
pilot provincial and municipal EPBs. Ten regional training centers have
been selected fo^ expansion and improvement and 20 trainers in these
centers will receive special trai'ning. A program of course subjects,
contents and duration was reviewed and agreed at appraisal.
11.       A second subproject consists of expanding a training program for
the staff of the Environmental and Economic Policy Research Center, which
has already begun with assistance from foreign experts, and will primarily
focus on environmental economics and policy analysis. This institute will
also carry out several of the studies to be financed under the project,
such as the studies on environmentally sound agriculture and pollution
control of rural industries for which terms of reference have been agreed
and foreign expert assistance has already been provided during project
preparation.
12.       Finally, a program of teacher training, curricula development,
and teaching equipment for environmental degree programs at eight Chinese
universities will be included in another subproject. A central part of
this subproject will be a study on environmental education at the universi-
ty and college level in China. This includes the creation of an Academic
Advisory Panel made up of Chinese and international experts to review the
study's terms of reference, oversee implementation of the study, review its
results and make recommendations based on this review. Further, since the
recommendations of such a study would be important to defining priority
areas for teacher training and curricula development, an understanding was
reached that a portion of the funds for this subDroiect would be allocated
for future programming. awaiting the final results ard recommendations of
the s=tud
13.       TXaining Program.  It is expected that about 1,000 NEPA and EPB
staff will be trained over a four-year period. Approximately 30 staff of
the Environment and Economic Policy Research Center will be trained and 400
teachers are expected to receive training under the university and college
environment program subproject. Training programs, containing specifics on
course content, duration and selection criteria were reviewed and agreed at
appraisal.
14.       Implementation Arrangements.  NEPA's Department of Institutional
and Personnel Management will be responsible for the NEPA and EPB network
technical assistance. This Department is currently responsible for
carrying out NEPA's personnel reform program which began in 1988 when NEPA
was chosen as one of a handful of government agencies to pilot the public
service system reform program. The university education component would be
the responsibility of NEPA's Education Department, which works with an
existing interagency environmental education committee that includes the
major Chinese universities and the State Education Commission.

Environmental Monitoring and Information Systems Sub-grojects
15.       Q             There are three subprojects under this component
whose objectives are: (a) to establish environmental information systems
at the grovincial lejl nationwide (27 provinces) to be able to provide
standardized informai:ion to the national level and at the same time provide
the provincial goverr.ments with technical support for environmental
management and decision making; (b) to improve the administrative capabili-
ty and monitoring system within the Global Environmental Monitoring System
(GEMS1 Air and Surface Water monitoring Rrograms in China, and (c) to
strengthen the reliabi..ity of environmental monitoring and measurement
standrds through the cevelopment and testing of standardized reference
materials for use in vaious environmental research and monitoring centers.
16.       DescriRtion.  The orovincial environmental information systems
subRroject will consist .f the following main parts: (a) establishment of
Environmental Informatior. Centers (EICs) in the Environmental Protection
Bureaus (EPBs) in 27 provtnces; (b) procurement of computer equipment and
installation of Local Area Networks in each of the 27 EPBs; (c) on the
basis of studies on standardization of data collection, coding, storage
processing etc., to develop) normalized environmental information applica-
tion softwares and to install these in each of the 27 EICs; (d) training
environmental information nanagement personnel from the 27 provincial EPBs
and computer application te-hnicians from the 27 EICs; (e) establishment of
an Environmental Infirmatiol Resources Management Strategic Plan for the
NEPA system and carrying out studies on how to optimize the use of environ-
mental data as support for c'ecision making; and (f) provision of technical
assistance to assist NEPA ir planning the equipment procurement, software
development and the studies vn the Environmental Information Resources
Management Plan. The most c)mplex of the software systems is a decision
support software system currontly being developed for NEPA and bein. tested
in several pilot projects, oie of which is being applied in the cit, of
Changzhou, with the assistance of the Association (funded by the Japan
Grant Facility). An understanding was reached that an evaluation Ranel of
foreign and local experts wouLd review that pilot Rrogram and make recom-
mendations on the design of tle more advanced Rarts of the proposed
decision support software pro.-ram under this suboroiect which will be
subseguently implemented in o02e Rrovince.
17.       For a decade an environmental statistical system and an environ-
mental monitoring system have axisted in China at all levels, though
initially not nationwide. These systems at lower levels are under the
direction of NEPA and its National Environmental Monitoring Center and at
all levels the EPBs are directing the Environmental Monitoring Centers
(EMCs). Environmental statistical information and monitoring data are
collected systematically and information is transferred to higher levels
and from the EMCs to the EPBs at all levels. At present, the EPBs at the
provincial level have only very few microcomputers and none of the provin-
cial EPBs have networks. NEPA plans to set up over the next 5 to 8 years



- 20 -                          ATTACMENT
Page 6 of 17
an integrated network of EICs at the national, provincial and city levels.
At the national level a Sino-Japanese center will be operational in 1995
and will greatly expand the capability of the National Environmental
Information Center. This subproject of the IDA project is intended to
strengthen the EIS at the provincial level to secure a parallel development
with the national level. One of the most important objectives of the
Environmental Information Resources Management Plan will be to ensure the
integration of the provincial and national level systems and optimize the
management of environmental information resources. Reviaw of several
provincial environmental statistical systems indicated that data collection
is standardized and well structured at most levels from enterprises to the
national level. Data are mainly transferred to higher levels as processed
data and only for organizations and agencies relevant to the environmental
management at these levels. Software modules to be developed range from
basic environmental data on ambient pollution levels to provincial manage-
ment and decision-making software including local environmental quality
forecasting, eavironmental impact assessment of new investments, analysis
of environmental investment options, and pollution discharge permit system.
18.       A second subproject to strengthen the GEMS/China Air and Surface
Water monitoring programs consists of four parts: (a) strengthening and
optimizing sampling sites, quality assurance and control procedures, data
processing and reporting procedures; (b) procurement and installation of
equipment to meet the international requirements of GEMS phase 1 program by
updating and renewal of instruments, changing manual air monitoring to
automatic monitoring and upgrading water laboratories; (c) expanding or
rebuilding of monitoring site stations; and (d) training programs. Since
1977 China has been participating in the WHO/UNEP Global Environmental
Monitoring System (GEMS) activities. The Ministry of Public Health was
responsible for the program. GEMS/Air programs were set up in five cities
(Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and Xi'an), and GEMS/Surface Water
programs were set up at four river sections (Changjiang River close to
Wuhun, Yellow River close to Jinan, Pearl River close to Gaoyao, Guangdong
Province, and Lake Taihu close to Wuxi). The stations have been operating
according to WHO/UNEP GEMS requirements, but so far there has been no
coordination between the GEMS/China program and the NEPA environmental
monitoring system. With the intention to combine the activities in the
GEMS/Air and Water program with NEPA's environment monitoring system, the
State Council decided in June 1992 to transfer the responsibility for the
GEMS/Air and Surface Water programs to NEPA. As the national technical
network and information center, the National Environmental Monitoring
Center has taken over the responsibility for the organization and adminis-
tration of the program, whereas responsibility for the routine monitoring
was transferred to local EMCs of the nine cities.
19.       The third subproject under this component focuses on upgrading
the national environmental analysis and measurement standards. It consists
of: (a) laboratory equipment; (b) research, development and testing of
reference materials; (c) establishment of a national data base facility;



- 21 -                          ATTACHINm
Page 7 of 17
and (d) training. For a decade the National Environmental Monitoring
Center, the National Research Center of Environmental Analysis and Measure-
ment and some provincial monitoring centers have been involved in re-
search, development and testing of both certified and non-certified
environmental reference materials (RMs). Most of the RMs comprise inorgan-
ic compounds. Among the present environmental pollutior' problems in China,
a considerable part are caused by organic compounds. To strengthen the
reliability of environmental monitoring and control, the research, develop-
ment and testing of organic RMs would be the focus of this subproject.
20.       Training.  Detailed training programs have been agreed contain-
ing specifics on course content, duration and selection criteria for all
three subprojects. Foreign consultant expertise has been identified where
needed in all three subprojects. Working groups to prepare, monitor and
manage the training programs have been established for each of the three
subprojects.
21.       Implementation Arrangements.  Subproject Steering Committees
(SSC) have been set-up for each of the three subprojects. The SSCs include
members representing not only the relevant NEPA functional department
responsible for each subproject, but the EPBs, and EMCs and other Chinese
experts. This is especially important for the provincial environmental
information system subproject. The tasks of the SSCs have been agreed, and
include: (a) review and final approval of the proposed subproject before
the IDA credit negotiations; (b) establishing relevant working groups to
carry out defined tasks to support the implementation of the different
parts of the subprojects (especially in regard to training, equipment
procurement and software development and application); and (c) monitoring
the implementation of the activities under the subprojects, including the
schedule, annual reports and budget, and making evaluations and recommenda-
tions.
Cleaner Industrial Production and Pollution Prevention SubDroject
22.       Objectives.  This subproject will support the nascent cleaner
production efforts underway in China. Its goal is capacity and capability
building, to develop and expand Chinese cleaner production expertise. At
the end of the project, China should have sufficient trained individuals to
provide future training and technical advice on cleaner production, local
information on cleaner production (as a result of demonstration projects),
and institutions motivated to continue the implementation of cleaner
production among its industry and to expand to other sectors, such as
transportation and agriculture. China will also have a tested model to
follow for these activities.
23.       Background.  Cleaner production is a comprehensive, preventive
environmental protection strategy that addresses all phases of industrial
production processes and product life cycles. Cleaner production, thus,



- 22 -
ATTACHMEN
Page 8 of 17
comprises such actions as operations and maintenance improvements, energy
and raw materials conservation, eliminating toxic substances as raw
materials and product content, and changing processes (adopting new
technology) and redesigning products. All these actions have the same aim;
to reduce the risks to humans and the environment of industrial activities
and consumption and to do so in the most cost-effective way possible.
24.       This preventive approach is a radical departure from the tradi-
tional way that all industrial and industrializing nations have been
practicing environmental protection over the past 20-30 years. Traditional
methods are reactive, often crisis management oriented. These reactive
methods are often referred to as "end-of-pipe" (EOP) since they all involve
adding--to the end of production processes (although not always physically
connected)--some kind of system to manage wastes that flow out. Such
systems include recycling, wastewater treatment facilities, air scrubbers,
landfills, incinerators, and the like. And, because they are reactive, EOP
systems do not conserve materials and energy. Conversely, they tend to
consume more energy and other raw materials to store or process pollutants.
25.       Cleaner production, then, reduces--and sometimes eliminates--the
need for EOP systems. This results in two basic benefits. Cleaner
processes and products pose less risks to the environment and society
(including workers). They also save money for industry because environmen-
tal benefits are gained at lower cost; processes become more efficient.
This is true even when initial investment costs are high (for new technolo-
gy, for instance). All existing analysis of cleaner production shows that
payback periods can be very short (months to a few years when compared with
alternative EOP systems). EOP systems not only have investment costs, but
continuing costs for operations and maintenance.
26.       Little of this comparative analysis has been done in China.
Thus, it is not clear that the same level of economic benefits will accrue
in China. One goal, therefore, of the demonstration projects component of
this subproject will be to collect data on the economic (and environmental)
benefits of cleaner production within the Chinese context.
27.       Description.  To assure continuity and sustainability, this sub-
project is designed with four major components: (a) a policy review; (b)
institution building; (c) training; and (d) demonstration projects. The
components are inter-related and will have to be carefully phased and
coordinated to maximize their potential. For instance, the poli_:y review
will help to identify institutional needs, the demonstration projects are a
form of specialized training and are designed to provide feedback to
general training activities and to generate information that will strength-
en the institutional component. UNEP's Industry and Environment Program
Activity Center has been instrumental in the design and preparation of this
component and will continue to assist the subproject during implementation.

28.       A goliJv review needs to be conducted to find out what kinds of
new policies China could introduce as incentives to the adoption of cleaner
production and to identify existing policies that constitute barriers to
the adoption of cleaner production. There is a wealth of cleaner produc-
tion analyses on policy issues done in western countries, the U.S. and
Europe. This work can form a basis for beginning the investigation of
Chinese policy vis-a-vis c_eaner production. The policy study would have
five parts: (a) an inventory analysis of existing environmental policy and
industrial policy relating to cleaner production by pollution prevention;
(b) an inventoy analysis of the existing permit system and the way it is
used in relationship to cleaner production by pollution prevention; (c) an
overview and analysis of the most effective policies to promote cleaner
production in countries outside China; (d) an inventory and analysis of the
obstacles and solutions found in the pilot demonstration projects; and (e)
combined results of the four components and analysis of the information in
such a way that policy options can be generated. UNEP's Industry and
Environment Program Advisory Center will provide assistance in setting-up
an international advisory board for the policy review.
29.       Cleaner production demonstration projects at the factory level
have many purposes. One is training, to instill in workers at all levels
the principles of prevention and provide them with. the tools to practice
it. Another is to prove to industrial managers that cleaner production is
good business. Another is to develop new cleaner production techniques and
technology or transfer them from other places. Lastly, demonstration
projects generate information that can be used elsewhere in other training
activities and as reference material. There are four main outcomes
expected from the demonstration projects: (a) a number of successful
demonstrations of the systematic pollution prevention audit approach to
implementing cleaner production principles, management practices, and
technologies in various industrial sectors; (b) development of a core of
systematic pollution prevention audit procedure experts among Chinese
academia, government, and industry; (c) an analysis of the demonstration
projects and plan for extension of the model to other industrial sectors
and provinces in China; and (d) publication on the technologies employed
and developed in the course of the demonstrations.
30.       Before making decisions about new process technology and end-of-
pipe technologies, industry needs to first consider pollution prevention
options. To do so, industry will need to carry out Dollution Drevention
audits. These audits will provide an understanding of how to reduce the
amounts of energy, water and raw materials used in production processes and
wastes and pollutants generated by them. With this pollution prevention
audit methodology, the conditions in existing and new facilities can be
analyzed to discover cleaner production options for: initial management
improvements, reduction of energy, water and raw material use, product
(re-) design opportunities, process modifications and internal process
reuse of waste streams. The result of using the methodology will be a
comprehensive plan for preventing pollution in and renovating existing



- 24 -                         ATTACHMENT
Page 10 of 17
industries. The plan sets priorities for measures to be taken and in vest-
ments to be made over the next 2-5 years. Parts of this plan will focus on
new process equipment investments based on sound economic and technical
decision-making.
31.       There will be three sets of demonstration projects (involving
both state owned industrial enterprises and town and village industrial
enterprises), all organized by industrial sector (including chemical,
metallurgy, non-ferrous, light industry, building materials, textile and
agro-industries). Approximately 30 demonstration project pollution audits
will be carried out in three cities and eight have been pre-identified for
follow-up investments under the project. The remaining demonstration
projects will be located in cities where future Bank-assisted environment
projects are expected and would be priority candidates for financial
assistance under those projects. Agreement has been reached on the
grocedures and criteria for the appraisal of the industrial pilot demon-
strations under the subproiect and the terms and conditions of on-lendina
the IDA proceeds to them. Financial criteria to be applied to the enter-
prises that receive funds under the subproject would include the financial
viability of the enterprise (debt service coverage ratio no less than 1.4
times), and provision that IDA funds would be on-lent at an interest rate
of 7 percent, with repayment periods commensurate with the projected cash
flow of the enterprises (maturities up to 10 years and grace periods up to
3 years) and with the enterprises bearing the foreign exchange risk. A
Chinese investment bank would be contracted by NEPA to be the financial
agency for the economic and financial appraisal of the enterprises and to
manage the disbursements and repayments. An understanding was reached that
NEPA would select by August 31, 1993 the financial agency from among four
Chinese investment banks that are currently providing financial intermedia-
tion services under other Bank-assisted projects (China Investment Bank,
Bank of Communications, People's Construction Bank of China and The Indus-
trial and Commercial Bank of China). Entering into the financial agncy
agreement. on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. would
be a condition of disbursement for this subnroiect.  NEPA would bear the
credit risk. The economic appraisal would have to demonstrate that the
solution proposed is the most cost effective of at least three feasible
options for pollution reduction. The proposed sub-loan for each pilot
demonstration would be limited to 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs
or 50 percent of total pilot demonstration costs, whichever is higher. No
single sub-loan would exceed US$1.0 million equivalent. NEPA would review
the completed appraisal reports and submit its recommendations to the
Association which would also review all the pilot demonstration appraisal
reports in full and approve the sub-loans.
32.       Igglementation Arrangements.  There will be a relatively small,
high-level Steering Committee of directors and administrators of various
participating organizations. This Steering Committee will guide the
project and oversee a Project Office. The Project Office will coordinate
the work among the different groups that will carry out parts of the



- 25 -                          ATTACHMENT
Page 11 of 17
project: the policy study group, the demonstration project group, and a
technical expert group with representatives from Chinese research insti-
tutes and universities.
33.       The institutional settings that are developed over the life of
this project will have the responsibility to assure continuity of cleaner
production in China after this project ends. While they can serve as focal
points for future projects supported by the Bank or other organizations,
these institutions should also be able to carry out training activities on
their own, including offering technical assistance and providing new
information on a continuing basis to Chinese industry. Once the policy
review has been completed and based on its conclusions, the institutional
structure may need to be reorganized or, more likely, simply expanded. In
order to provide proper outreach at the local level, the provincial
environmental and industrial bureaus will also need to designate officials
responsible for cleaner production. An early initiative of NEPA has been
to identify the appropriate industry representatives and/or organizations
with which to cooperate and bring into the network. Academic institutions
have also been brought into the organizational structure so as to develop
those institutions' ability to provide China with technical and policy
innovations.
34.       To connect the various institutions and assure sharing (and
avoid duplication) among them of information and expertise, a computer
network will be developed, based on the UNEP Industry and Environment
Activity Program Center's ICPIC (International Cleaner Production Informa-
tion Clearinghouse) and linked to it. The linkage will enhance technology
cooperation by both providing China with input on cleaner production from
other countries and by allowing China to share its expertise with the
worldwide Cleaner Production Network.
35.       UNEP's Industry and Environment Activity Program Center has
provided several experts who have worked with the Chinese to prepare this
subproject and have served as the core trainers. Three workshops (about
one month each) are scheduled over six months to begin the training
process, focusing primarily on the pollution prevention audit methodology.
The overall training program is expected to result in: (a) awareness
training provided to selected groups; (b) specialized training provided to
the individuals of the newly formed cleaner production network to enable
them to lead the project, and to specific industrial and governmental
institutions in the three participating demonstration cities; (c) training
materials developed especially for Chinese seminars and workshops and to
allow easy replicability of both awareness and specialized training
workshops throughout China following the end of the project; (d) a set of
publications as resource information for trainers and implementors of
cleaner production; and (e) documents for input into ICPIC, including
Chinese publications for listing in the bibliography and technical case
studies.

36.       TrAining.  The selection of people who will be able to provide
future training and technical assistance will be critical to the post-
project continuation of cleaner production activities in China. Thus a
selection process for participants has been agreed for each of the four
subproject components and the people to be trained to carryout the pollu-
tion prevention audits have already been selected. Participants will
include people with experience in training from technical and managerial
education institutes, people from environment and industry agencies, and
people from various industrial groups.
Environment and Ecological Studies
37.       Objectives.  This component of the project would provide an
assured and flexible source of financing for environmental studies to be
undertaken by NEPA and other ministries and agencies. Some of the studies
would involve institutions other than NEPA and are intended to help improve
interagency and interministerial coordination in the setting of. environmen-
tal priorities and implementation of policies and programs and integration
of environmental objectives into economic development policies and programs
(e.g. the chemical industry pollution control, environmentally sound
agriculture, and motor vehicle pollution control studies).
38.       Description.  Seven studies have been pre-identified: motor
vehicle pollution control, hazardous and toxic waste management, pollution
control in chemical industries, management and coordination of ecological
monitoring, policy and implementation of China's pollution effluent levy
system, development policy for envizonmentally sound agriculture, and
pollution control policies for town and village enterprises. Preliminary
terms of reference have been agraed for the latter four. Funds from the
PHRD Trust Fund of Japan are being used to assist in the preparation of the
other three pre-identified studies. Final terms of reference for all seven
of the pre-identified studies would be agreed by December 31, 1993.
39.       Training.  Training programs would be included in most of the
studies to assist the respective implementing agencies and ministries to
manage activities associated with the studies and to ensure that provision
is made for the transfer of knowledge relating to methodological approaches
and carrying-out recommendations of the studies.
40.       Implementation.  NEPA would be responsible for the administra-
tion of this component, with assistance from the State Planning Commis-
sion's (SPC) Environment Division for the review and approval of new
proposals to be identified during project implementation. All proposals
would be submitted to the Bank for final approval. NEPA would be responsi-
ble for coordination among the ministries and agencies involved in imple-
mentation and monitoring of the studies. NEPA would appoint a suitably
qualified coordinator for this component of the project and selection

procedures have been agreed for future studies to be financed out of the
unallocated portion of this component.
Environmental ImRact Assessment System Subproject
41.       Objective.  This sub-project has three objectives: (a) assist
the preparation of environmental assessments (EAs) of Bank projects; (b)
strengthen the Chinese EA system through further development of EA techni-
cal guidelines and methodologies for conventional investment projects and
develop new guidelines for conducting regional and sector EAs; and (c)
strengthen EA training programs aimed at the Chinese institutions respon-
sible for carrying-out or administering EAs.
42.       DescriRtion.  The first component under this sub-project con-
sists of a line of credit to assist in the preparation of EAs for Bank
financed projects, similar in approach to the lines of credit under the
Bank's general technical assistance projects in China that provide inter
alia funds for other aspects of project preparation for Bank projects.
Based on the number of Bank EA category "A" projects in the proposed
lending program to China and an average cost for medium to large scale
project EAs of between US$200,000-250,000, it is expected that between 8-10
EAs would be assisted from funds under this component.
43.       The second component of the sub-project consists of a line of
credit to finance proposals to strengthen the EA process. First, proposals
to develop technical guidelinss for specific sectors would be sought. One
such proposal has been pre-identified relating to port and harbor develop-
ment from the Ministry of Communication. Second, proposals would also be
made focusing on regional development projects as test cases for the
development of regional development EA methodologies. Six such proposals
have been pre-identified involving two urban industrial zones in Shanghai
and Beijing, a bay (Jiaozhou Bay), two basins (Yerqiang Basin and Taihu
Basin), and agricultural development in the Yellow River delta.
44.       A detailed training program has been reviewed and agreed that
includes both direct training of staff and the training of trainers. This
work would build on training materials prepared under a previous Asian
Development Bank (ADB) EA technical assistance program to NEPA. The
training will take place at five regional training centers and will involve
about 900 people, both EA practitioners from environmental research
institutions, universities, and technical design institutes, as well as
managers and regulators of the EA system from NEPA, the provincial and
municipal EPBs and sector ministries.
45.       ImRlementation Arrangement.  NEPA's Environmental Impact Assess-
ment Division will administer this component. All sub-project proposals
under the two lines of credit (soft loans, on terms and conditions accept-
able to IDA) will be submitted to the Association for final approval and

technical and procedural selection criteria have been agreed. The training
component of this project will include the cost of a professional training
expert to assist NEPA at two stages during implementation. The first stage
would be at the beginning of the project, to help design the training
program, including the organization of courses and the preparation of
teaching materials. During the second stage, near the end of the project,
the expert would assist NEPA with the preparation of training case studies
based upon the results of the EAs carried-out under the other two compo-
nents of the EA subproject.
Overall Project Administration and Implementation
46.       Project Cost and Disbursement Profile.  The total project cost
is estimated at US$76 million. The foreign cost is an estimated US$52.2
million. The local cost is expected to be US$23.8 million, not including
taxes and duties, from which the project, related imports and overseas
consultants' fees and remuneration are exempt. Disbursement estimates
(Schedule B) are based on standard IDA profiles for technical assistance
projects, adjusted to take account of the advanced state of preparation,
with most subprojects under the project having been fully prepared and
appraised.
47.       Financing Plan.  The project would be financed by a Development
Credit of SDR 35.5 million (US$50 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms
with 35 years maturity. The IDA Credit would finance the cost of foreign
and local consultants, in-country and overseas training, and equipment.
NEPA and CAS would provide local financing of Y 150 million, amounting to
approximately 34 percent of project costs and equivalent to about US$26
million. The Government will allocate IDA Credit funds on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA at a 1 percent interest rate with a 20-year
repayment period, including a grace period of 5 years. NEPA would on-lend
the funds under the cleaner production sub-project to the industrial
enterprises at an interest rate of 7S with repayment periods based on the
financial assessment of the enterprise (see para. 31). No UNDP or other
suitable grant funds were readily available for the various project compo-
nents.
48.       Implementation and Administrative Arrangements.   NEPA has a
project office located in its Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO)
that is in charge of project coordination with the functional departments
that are responsible for the implementation of their respective sub-
projects. FECO and CAS's Office of External Finance also coordinate
procurement, disbursements, accounting and monitoring of project progress.
Implementation arrangements for individual components and subprojects are
discussed above for each main component. CAS and NEPA have prepared
detailed project plan documents for each subproject that describe the
objectives, scope and content including training programs, schedules for
subproject implementation and tables of monitorable performance indicators

which are available in the Project File. These reports have been reviewed
and agreed with the Association and final revisions in these reports would
be completed by November 30, 1993. NEPA and CAS would maintain procedures
satisfactory to IDA for supervising the work of consultants and reviewing
their reports and recommendations. All individuals or groups that partici-
pate in overseas training or conferences would prepare reports summarizing
and evaluating the results, which can be used to further disseminate the
results and to provide material for domestic training.
49.       Since it is not possible to identify all training and technical
assistance needs in the beginning of the project, an understanding was
reached that some funds will be retained (US$600,000) for technical
assistance and training for future and unforeseen needs. During the first
year of project implementation, the various departments and organizations
participating in the sub-projects under the CAS and NEPA parts of the
project would be given the opportunity to apply for the use of the uncom-
mitted funds by sending detailed proposals to their respective project
offices in CAS and NEPA.  It was agreed that by SeRtember 30. 1994. GAS and
NEPA would review and assess the implementation of their respective first
year training and technical assistance programs and. based on these reviews
and the needs identified during the process, would review and revise, if
necessary. the existing programs and select the best new DroRosals for
additional funds. Detailed progosals for additional technical assistance
and training. including the terms of reference would then be sent to the
Association for review and apDroval.
50.       Procurement and Disbursements (see also Schedule B).  Consultant
services to be financed from the proposed credit would be obtained in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Equip-
ment and materials, with an estimated value of about US$31.0 million would
be procured through ICB. ICB will be carried out for NEPA and CAS under
the auspices of one of the several procurement companies in China with
experience in ICB on Bank projects. The model bidding documents agreed
between the World Bank Group and the Government may be modified to conform
with the Bank's standard bidding documents and will be used for most of the
project procurement. Scientific research equipment and computers which
must conform to specific functional parameters and specialized requirements
of individual research activities, would be procured following a two-stage
procedure. The first-stage procedure will refine and normalize the
technical specifications of the computers and special instruments intended
to be procured under the project, providing the flexibility needed for
scientists to acquire items conforming to the exact specifications required
for individual research activities, and at the same time retaining competi-
tion to meet the objectives of procurement under ICB. The second stage of
the process would consist of the evaluation of the normalized technical
proposals and the price quotations. Under all ICB procedures, local
manufacturers would be permitted to participate, where appropriate, and
would be eligible for a 15 percent margin of domestic preference or
prevailing customs duties, whichever is lower, in evaluation of bids.

51.        A limited number of highly specialized instruments, spare
parts, and instruments where standardization is warranted, would be
procured through LIB, international shopping, local shopping or direct
shopping as appropriate. Specifically, goods estimated to cost less than
the equivalent of US$200,000 per contract, up to an aggregate not to exceed
the equivalent of US$10.0 million may be procured under contracts awarded
through LIB; proprietary items, spare parts, auxiliary equipment and
accessories, and goods estimated to cost less than the equivalent of
US$100,000 per contract up to an aggregate not to exceed the equivalent of
US$3.7 million, may be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of
comparison of prices from at least three suppliers from three different
countries; equipment (under the environmental studies subprojects and the
reference material testing subproject) estimated to cost less than the
equivalent of $100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate not to exceed the
equivalent of $250,000, may be procured under contracts on the basis of
comparison of prices from at least three local suppliers; items needed for
standardization, or of a highly specialized nature, may be procured through
direct shopping, after prior review by the Association and in accordance
with the procedures acceptable to the Association (not expected to exceed a
total of US$500,000). Prior review by IDA would be required for equipment
contracts estimated to be US$200,000 or more (about 90 percent of equipment
contracts by value).
52.       Technical support services would be included in the bidding and
contracts from suppliers for an agreed list of major items (computers and
sophisticated research equipment) to be procured under the project. Such
services, which would be for an extended period beyond the initial warranty
period, would include stocking of spare parts, services of maintenance
experts as and when required, and training of Chinese scientists and engi-
neers in the operation and maintenance of the equipment or instruments.
NEPA and CAS would identify the equipment requiring technical support
services and discuss and agree on the list with the Association before
initiating the procurement process. Technical support services would be
procured as an associated service at the time of equipment purchase.
53.       It is estimated that about 20 percent of the credit would
finance consultant services, about 10 percent would finance in-country and
overseas training and 70 percent, equipment. IDA would finance: 100
percent of expenditures for consultant services; 100 percent of expendi-
tures for overseas study tours and other training; and, for equipment, 100
percent of foreign expenditures for direct imports, 100 percent of local
ex-factory costs for locally manufactured items and 75 percent of local
expenditures for other items procured locally. In order to enable urgent
work to be carried out on several subprojects, retroactive financing up to
US$600,000 would be required. This financing would apply to consultants'
services and training expenditures incurred under these subprojects after
December 31, 1992. To facilitate disbursement two Special Accounts, each
to be maintained in US dollars with authorized allocations of US$3.0
million and US$2.0 million, would be established for NEPA and CAS, respec-
tively, in a commercial bank satisfactory to IDA. These amounts were
agreed on the basis of the advanced state of preparation of the project.

Page 17 of 17
For expenditures relating to training, overseas study tours and contracts
for goods, each valued less than US$200,000 equivalent, reimbursements
would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOEs). Documents
supporting the SOEs would be retained at NEPA and CAS and made available
for review by IDA supervision missions.
54.       Account and Audit Arrangements  Project accounts and the IDA
Special Accounts would be maintained by NEPA and CAS. The project ac-
counts, including the Special Accounts and documentation for SOEs, would be
subject to an annual audit by an external auditor acceptable to IDA. It is
expected that the Audit Administration of China will carry out the audits.
The audit report, including a separate opinion on SOEs used as a basis for
disbursement, would be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the
Government's fiscal year.
55.       Monitoring and Progress Reporting.  NEPA and CAS would be
responsible for m3nitoring their respective parts of the project and would
collect, review and evaluate information regarding individual subprojects
and would prepare semi-annual reports to IDA summarizing the project's
substantive and financial progress, and identifying subproject implementa-
tion problems and solutions. Tables of monitorable performance indicators
and detailed training program schedules are a part of each subproject.  &
annual review of grooect imilementation would--be undertake_n by NEPA and CAS
and every two years anjin-country review would be undertaken jointly with
the Association.
56.       Project Launch and Supervision Arrangements.  Overall progress
of the project, and its administrative, financial and procurement activi-
ties, would be monitored by NEPA and CAS and followed by a task manager in
the China and Mongolia Department, Environment and Human Resources Divi-
sion. In addition, most subprojects would be followed by Bank staff or
consultants specialized in the subproject's topic. Workshops for most
subprojects are planned as a part of project launch activities during the
first six months of project implementation. In regard to the two most
complex subprojects, CERN and the industrial cleaner production sub-
projects, special arrangements will be made to obtain the needed expertise
for supervision. In the case of the CERN subproject, during project
supervision some of the same international experts would be contracted that
were members of the scientific team that helped prepare the subproject and
also are part of the U.S. LTER Program (Long Term Ecological Research) that
has an ongoing scientific exchange program with CAS. In regard to the
cleaner production subproject, UNEP's Industry and Environment Activity
Program Center, which helped prepare the subproject, has agreed to maintain
close involvement with the implementation of the subproject as a part of
its overall program in China.
