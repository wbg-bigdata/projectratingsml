                         The project would support the implementation of the 2008-2013 Barbados National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, specifically to increase: - Adoption of safe behaviors, in
                         particular amongst key populations at higher risk. - Access to prevention, treatment and social care, in particular for key populations at higher risk. - Capacity of
                         organizational and institutional structures that govern the NAP. - Use of quality data for problem identification, strategy definition and measuring results.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Barbados is on track to achieve MDG 6 (halt or reverse HIV/AIDS) by 2015. Annual trends in estimated HIV incidence show a slow decline since the year 2000. Barbados has
                         eliminated mother to child HIV transmission (MTCT) since 2007 and 100% of identified HIV positive pregnant women received a complete course of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to
                         reduce MTCT in 2012. The rate of AIDS related mortality has dramatically decreased, largely due to the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2002. Barbados has
                         exemplified regional leadership in expanding access to high quality treatment and care for HIV/AIDS. Currently, 88.9% of those in need of ART are receiving therapy (exceeding the
                         project indicator target of 60%). Importantly, the quality of care is reflected in the very high rate of virological suppression in those patients retained in care. Barbados is one of the

                         A wide range of prevention activities has been implemented by both the public sector and civil society. The interventions have focused on increasing knowledge and awareness,
                         reducing stigma and discrimination, HIV testing and counseling, distribution of condoms, and training for development of HIV prevention interventions. As one of the key prevention

                         activities, Barbados continues to scale up HIV testing and counseling. The new “Policy on HIV Testing in Barbados? was developed (Ministry of Health, September 2012) and
                         provides the overarching policy on HIV testing and the guiding principles for different types of testing.

                         The Grant Scheme to support civil society organizations (CSOs) was launched in September 2011 Since the launch of the CSO Grant Scheme, a total of 46 applications were
                         received from 35 CSOs which resulted in the approval of 18 grants at March 2013. Of the 18 grants approved, 2 focus on MSM and one on Sex Workers with 6 projects having
