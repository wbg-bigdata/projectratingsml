F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the Agricultural Development Project (ADP) was to assist the
Government of Lao (GOL) to reduce rural poverty in the project provinces by improving
and increasing agricultural production. This objective reflected GOL priorities regarding
poverty reduction and the development of irrigated farming systems, and was in line with
the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which had poverty reduction as its
overarching priority. It was also consistent with the government strategy to devolve
responsibilities and activities in support of agricultural development to the Provincial

1.      PROJECT CONTEXT, DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DESIGN

1.1     Context at Appraisal

        Country and Sector Context

        The project focused on the overarching priority of the World Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy in place in 2001, namely poverty reduction. It was also consistent
with the CAS's objectives for the rural economy, which reflected the importance of the
agriculture sector in contributing more than 50 percent of GDP and providing
employment to over 80 percent of the country's labor force. Wide-ranging sector work
had been undertaken prior to project inception and the design responded to the key issues
faced by the sector: (a) weak institutional and human resources capacity; (b) inadequacies
in rural infrastructure and related support services; and (c) a weak enabling environment
for rural sector development.

        At the time of appraisal, annual sector growth rates had fallen from nearly 4
percent in the 1980s to around 3 percent and lower in the late-1990s. Total cultivated area
averaged at 700,000 ha, of which rice accounted for more than 80 percent. However, only
a small percentage was under irrigation and the sector was unable to meet the needs of
both a growing population and provide surpluses, either for export or for food and feed
processing industries.

        Within this context, the project was conceived as a first phase of a long-term
program in support of the Government's strategy for supporting growth in the agricultural
sector and eliminating rural poverty. It was also intended that the project would reinforce
the Government's program of decentralization with increased responsibility devolved to
Provincial    and   District  administrations   and    community-level    involvement      in
implementation. Thus, the choice of project area was intended to target provinces with
under-utilized agricultural potential and high incidences of poverty, proximity in
geographic coverage, and ensure complementarily with other Government of Lao (GOL)
programs.



1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Performance Indicators


        The PAD is not consistent in the definition of the Project Development Objectives
(PDOs). According to Section A1, "the primary objective of the project was to reduce
rural poverty by improving and increasing agricultural production. This it will do by
taking a community-based approach, in designing and implementing components which
directly impact the lives of the poor in the participating provinces and districts. By
addressing the underlying constraints faced by the agricultural sector, the project will also
have a long-term positive impact on sector growth. This too will contribute to reducing
rural poverty". The results framework in Annex 1 states the following PDO: "Key
constraints are removed to intensifying agriculture, increasing agricultural productivity,
and providing basic services for low-income subsistence farmers through responding to
community priority needs in target project areas". Given that the PAD mentions several
objectives without a clear hierarchy, the ICRR has taken the PDO as stated in the


                                             1

Development Credit Agreement (DCA) as this is legally binding and was not revised
during project implementation. The DCA defines the PDO as follows: "The objective of
the project is to assist the Borrower in reducing rural poverty in the project provinces
through the improvement of, and increase in agricultural production".

          In view of the discrepancies between the PAD and DCA regarding the Key
Performance Indicators (KPI), with the PAD only establishing target values for a few
outcome and output indicators and no baseline values provided, the ICRR uses KPIs as
defined in the DCA including the target values. At outcome level, these are:

          (a)         increased agricultural productivity in project-supported irrigation schemes,
               with cropping intensity and paddy yields by 20 percent and 15 percent,
               respectively;

          (b)         improved access to basic agricultural services: at least 50 percent of
               households in project area reporting improved access to advise from extension
               staff at mid-term and adopting improved agricultural practices at project
               closing; and

          (c)         increase in household incomes by 100 percent over 2000/01 levels 2 years
               after completion of irrigation rehabilitation work.

          The output-level KPI for each component of the project are detailed in Section F
of the data sheet together with a discussion of their appropriateness in Section 2.3.



1.3       Revised Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators, and
          reasons/justification


          The Project Development Objective was not formally revised during the course of
the project. However, following the April 2005 Mid-Term Review (MTR), KPIs were
further quantified and additional KPIs were introduced, both at outcome and output
levels3. Baseline values were added from different years but the source and validity of
this data could not be verified by the ICRR team. These adjustments, and changes were,
however, not reflected through legal amendments or approval requested at Vice President
and/or Board level. Changes were as follow:

          (a) indicators for measuring the impact of increased agricultural production and
               productivity on the income and food self-sufficiency of the target population
               were fine-tuned and quantified;

          (b)         an additional key indicator reflecting the incidence of water-borne
               diseases was included at MTR in order to assess the impact of the social
               infrastructure works sub-component; and




3Output indicators identified in the PAD were restated as intermediate outcome indicators and target values were quantified where
missing.



                                                                 2

        (c)     an additional indicator ­ Village Development Committees developed and
            functioning ­ was intended to assess the impact of project support on
            community-level capacities.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries


        The project's primary target groups were poor rural families (involving more than
50,000 individuals), primarily small-scale subsistence farmers and landless laborers
within the four project provinces. While a substantial proportion of project investments
are targeted at rural populations involved in irrigated agriculture, the Village Investment
for the Poor (VIP) component (Component 2) was targeted at landless households in
irrigation villages, as well as at the poorest villages in the non-irrigated, upland areas, and
within these at women, ethnic minorities, and poorer households.

        The benefits from the project's activities accrue at several levels: (a) rehabilitating
irrigation schemes results in increased cropping intensities (largely due to providing
secure irrigation during the dry season), improved water control during the wet season
and better on-farm water management, and better farming practices through extension
and on-farm research, access to improved seeds and diversification into ordinary rice and
other crops, all contributing to increased crop production and farm incomes; (b) support
for social infrastructure (water supplies, sanitation and access roads) result in both direct
social and economic benefits to all rural households in the project area; and (c) income
generating activities under the VIP components targets poor households with no access to
irrigation.

        Significant institutional, social and economic benefits accrue from the
institutional strengthening measures at all levels of government involved in the project, as
well as for the farmers through improved technical support and their participation in the
decision-making process.


1.5     Original Components


        At appraisal, the Agricultural Development Project (ADP) had six main
components: (1) Rural Infrastructure; (2) Village Investment for the Poor (VIP); (3)
Improved Agricultural Services; (4) Water Users Association (WUA); (5) Environmental
Management; and (6) Support for Project Implementation and Coordination. The DCA
consolidated these to become three main components: Components 1 and 2 as at
appraisal, and Component 3 consisting of the sub-components:                  (a) Institutional
Strengthening for Agricultural Services (including WUA); (b) Environmental
Management; and (c) Strengthening Implementation Arrangements. At appraisal, all
components were to be funded through the International Development Agency (IDA)
Credit. However, shortly after project effectiveness, the World Bank was able to secure
grant funds totalling US$1.14 million from the Japanese Social Development Fund
(JSDF) to support the VIP component. These funds were fully disbursed during the
period 2002-05, and subsequently, upon request from GOL, the component was
continued using the IDA Credit.

           Component 1: Rural Infrastructure (US$10.97 M4, US$10.75 M5)

           Three sub-components were financed: (a) Irrigation Infrastructure Rehabilitation -
to rehabilitate some 22 irrigation schemes (both gravity and pump-based), complete
construction of secondary canal systems at selected schemes, expand the coverage of
tertiary distribution systems and convert diesel-motor pumps to electric pumps; (b) Rural
Access Tracks - to rehabilitate some 165 km of village access tracks linking irrigation
schemes rehabilitated under the project to villages and the road network, including road
drainage crossings; and (c) Village Water Supply and Sanitation - to install household
and school sanitary pits, shallow wells and tubewells, including equipment, and carry out
health and hygiene awareness campaigns.

           Component 2: Village Investment for the Poor (US$2.02 M, US$1.80 M)

           To provide grant financing for village-level, small-scale, demand-driven
infrastructure and income-generating and other productive agricultural investment
projects in villages not benefiting from irrigation scheme rehabilitation works. The
projects to be supported would be within the technical and managerial capacity of the
villagers and would be closely linked and integrated with the agricultural extension
component of the project.

           Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Implementation Support (US$
5.22 M, US$8.28 M)

           Three sub-components were financed: (a) to strengthen the capacity of provincial
and district-level Agricultural and Forestry Service Offices (PAFSO/DAFSO) in both
providing technical services to farmers and in carrying out a program of on-farm adaptive
research and demonstrations, and to establish and strengthen water users associations at
the irrigation schemes being rehabilitated under the project; (b) to strengthen the capacity
of PAFSOs and the provincial offices of the Science, Technology and Environment
Agency (STEA) in monitoring environmental aspects of the project and providing
appropriate guidance to project stakeholders on improved environmental management;
and (c) to strengthen central level project coordination and the Provincial Project
Implementation Offices (PPIO). This included technical assistance and training in
planning, project and financial management, and the provision of vehicles and
equipment.

1.7     Other Significant Changes


        The project became effective in October 2001 and responsibility for coordination
of project implementation and reporting was to reside with a Project Coordination Office
(PCO) in the Department of Planning of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF).
In January 2002, IDA was informed that GOL had established a new agency, also under
MAF, in August 2001, the National Agriculture and Forestry Extension Service
(NAFES), which would be responsible for all agricultural extension activities, and for
implementing externally-financed projects in the agriculture and forestry sectors.
Similarly, at provincial level, PAFSOs would be established and support extension agents
at the district level. Thus, in April 2002, the PCO was transferred to NAFES.

        The Credit was amended in early 2002 to reflect the availability of grant support
from the JSDF to finance the VIP component. This was carried out in three phases: a
first phase, comprising two years, and a second phase, comprising one further year, were
funded with JSDF resources (US$1.14 M). Upon a request from government, the third
phase was implemented with the originally allocated funds under the IDA Credit from
March 2005 to June 2007 (US$0.33 M).

        In July 2005, IDA agreed to finance all incremental operating costs from the
Credit with GOL only funding taxes and land compensation/resettlement costs. Under a
further amendment to the Credit in June 2007, IDA agreed to an extension of the project
for a further 12 months to enable completion of ongoing subprojects and consolidation of
activities using the balance of funds remaining under the Credit.


             2. KEY FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOMES

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

        The project quality at entry was moderately satisfactory. Overall project design
responded to the Government's sectoral strategy and priorities and built on the lessons
from IDA operations in both the country and the region. Its design focused on
strengthening existing decentralized institutions, assisting demand-driven opportunities
for relatively small-scale productive investments, and promoting community-based
operation and maintenance of existing irrigation schemes.

        However, on review, several areas are identified where project design could have
been improved. The appraisal document is, in several instances, inconsistent and provides
variable detail of the major cost components of the project. KPIs were poorly defined
and the capacity development objectives and consequential training requirements at the
project and component levels were not clearly stated. The relative inexperience of
decentralized integrated rural development in the country and the serious capacity
constraints at institutional and human resource levels were identified at appraisal, but
project design was not consistent with this assessment. Although substantial resources
were allocated in Component C, for project management and including international TA,
project design is complex, with a wide range of decentralized activities and the need to
coordinate inputs from different agencies in dispersed geographical areas.



                                               5

         In addition, and more importantly, the implementation schedule for civil works
was unrealistic in view of the considerable capacity constraints identified. Rehabilitation
works at five schemes were planned to start soon after project effectiveness to be
followed by rehabilitation of a further eight schemes during the first year of the project.
Moreover, the inputs and time required for the preparation of Resettlement Action Plans
(RAP) at each of the project's irrigation schemes were underestimated; and the project
design did not adequately address the need for Water User Groups (WUGs) and Farmer
Irrigation Groups (FIGs) to be trained in on-farm water management techniques,
particularly for non-rice, dry season irrigated crops.

2.2      Implementation

         Overall Progress.                 Initially, project implementation was very slow and
unsatisfactory6. The project only became fully operational two years after appraisal due
to a combination of factors including: (a) a change in location of the project coordination
functions and associated personnel changes; (b) delays in procurement of goods and civil
works; and (c) late recruitment of the national and international TA team which was only
fielded in May 2003. Only the VIP component, which benefited from independent TA
through JSDF funding, started in 2002. Following the MTR in May 2005, overall
implementation performance improved. However, the civil works component lagged
behind and most of the irrigation rehabilitation works was only completed during the last
two years of project implementation. A one-year extension was agreed in mid-2007 to
utilize savings arising from: (a) the cancellation of irrigation sub-projects (non-feasible
scheme or non-performing contractor); (b) redistribution in category expenditures; and
(c) foreign exchange savings. By the end of the implementation period, all intermediate
outcome indicator targets had been substantially met with the delivery and installation of
pump sets at the last irrigation scheme, flood damage repair works completed at two
further schemes, and access tracks and remaining school latrines completed, VIP
activities and agriculture extension activities fully funded.

         The main implementation issues are summarized as follows:

         Delays in Civil Works. Due to the initial difficulties with procurement and
financial management and the delay in recruiting the TA team, preparation of irrigation
and access track designs fell behind schedule. Initial designs conducted by locally-
recruited consultants had not been based on thorough consultations with farmers and
district and provincial irrigation staff and were, in some cases, inappropriate. The need to
repeat designs led to further delays which were exacerbated by the requirement that
RAPs should be prepared for each of the project's irrigation schemes, as well as
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for seven of the schemes. With little
experience in the country on the procedures and requirements related to RAPs and EMPs,
the Water Management Specialist on the TA team was required to assist this activity full-
time.

         Following design reviews and changes, and the acceptance of the RAPs,
construction of the first phase of nine schemes commenced in the dry season of
2004/2005, some two years behind the schedule presented in the PAD. The remaining

ten, second-phase, schemes were similarly delayed due principally to the need for design
revisions. In late 2005, heavy rains resulted in damage to several schemes that were
recently completed and IDA assisted the project and TA staff in undertaking a detailed
overall review of scheme designs as well as an evaluation of specific scheme damages.
Options were identified to address design weaknesses and to prepare remedial designs
and repairs to damaged works. Also following detailed design work, adjustments to
access track lengths were incorporated in the final works to take account of the
availability of access along main canal banks for villages benefiting from irrigation
scheme rehabilitation and to allow for price increases resulting from fuel cost escalation.

        Institutional Implementation Issues. The limited capacity of provincial staff in
procurement processing as well as in financial and other reporting was a persistent issue
during project implementation, exacerbated by the late arrival of the TA and the weak
position of the central Project Coordination Office (PCO) vis-à-vis the Provincial Project
Implementation Offices (PPIOs). Within the decentralized implementation framework,
the PPIOs had considerable autonomy in project implementation while the PCO's role
was to coordinate overall implementation and serve as an intermediary between IDA and
the PPIOs. This frequently resulted in poor quality and delayed preparation of
documentation and reports, weak bid evaluations, and serious shortcomings of the
performance of the PCO - as consistently flagged in the Bank Supervision Reports until
late-2006. The TA team and IDA supervision missions focused on these areas and
assisted in clarifying procedures, providing additional training where required, and
intensifying supervision inputs. Consequent improvements in procurement, financial
management and contract management resulted in accelerated implementation of the civil
works and extension activities and the project was able to meet or exceed most physical
output targets.

        Financial Management. Although not identified as a critical risk factor at
appraisal, financial management emerged as a major limitation to timely implementation
due to staff capacity constraints and inadequate and/or inappropriate financial flow
mechanisms. With the responsibility for ADP implementation being passed to NAFES,
staff that had received training in financial management was not transferred and the staff
that was subsequently appointed to the PCO did not have adequate training and capacity
in financial management. In addition, the delayed development, and subsequent use of a
chart of accounts for the project, as well as training in associated financial management
software, also contributed to a situation where the project was at risk of being
downgraded to unsatisfactory status. A financial management consultant was engaged to
strengthen the PCO's overall financial management activities and to reinforce provincial
and district staff. Successive supervision missions also addressed the issue and provided
additional guidance from specialist staff based in Bangkok in addition to the short-term
TA support.

        In late 2005, it was agreed to restructure the finance unit in the PCO by
combining it with the Sustainable Forestry and Rural Development Project (SUFORD) in
NAFES and to recruit more qualified replacement staff. Following these measures, and
with GOL financial management procedures simplified, overall improvements to
financial management functions were achieved and, in particular, to the management of

the project's Special Account and the provincial-level Second Generation Special
Accounts (SGSA).

         Technical Assistance. The project has used the amount of TA foreseen in the
PAD, with some minor redistribution between international and regional (see Annex 2 for
more detail). While the overall amount of TA was justified and necessary, it could have
been used more effectively. In addition to the delayed TA recruitment mentioned above,
TA use by the PCO tended to be on an ad hoc basis, with specialists being called upon to
address immediate needs and to assist the PCO in administrative matters rather than focus
on pre-defined, and agreed work plans. This was exacerbated by the fact that the PCO
remained understaffed in critical skills' areas and during critical periods of project
implementation, with the TA having to fill these gaps.

         In addition, the programming of intermittent inputs from the Chief Technical
Advisor (CTA) not only resulted in the Deputy Team Leader/Agricultural Training and
Extension Specialist taking over his leadership role during periods of absence but also
appears to have diluted his technical contribution to project activities. In view of the
relative complexity and dispersion of project activities and the evident capacity
constraints facing the implementing agencies at central, provincial and district levels, it
appears that the use of a full-time CTA presence during the initial project period to assist
the PCO and provide quality assurance of project implementation monitoring, reporting
and management procedures would have been a better use of TA resources.


2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

         M&E has been one of the weakest elements of the ADP and the efforts of the
Bank and the TA team have been insufficient in this regard. As noted in Section 2.1, only
a few of the KPI were clearly defined and quantified at appraisal and no proper baseline
data is available for most KPI. The baseline survey made available to the ICRR team
consisted of a compilation of secondary data collected during 1999/2000, with
unnecessarily detailed statistics on social and demographic indicators at district (not
village) level (view Section F of data sheet). In 2003, Participatory Rapid Appraisals
(PRA) were conducted for designing village development plans but the results have not
been analyzed and aggregated and could hence not be used for monitoring purposes.

         TA support for M&E was insufficient and of poor quality. A project M&E manual
was developed in late 2003 but the system was over-designed and too complex to be
handled by district extension staff and much of the information to be collected was of
little relevance for monitoring project progress. The MTR mission revised and simplified
the system, introduced additional KPIs at the outcome level, and stressed the need to fill
vacant M&E positions in the PCO as well as mobilizing appropriate TA support.
However, some of the newly introduced KPIs are difficult to measure (e.g., household
incomes and rice-self sufficiency levels and the incidence of water-borne diseases) and
little follow-up support was provided to build the capacity of project staff at all levels to
collect and analyze the data properly. Only in late-2005 was an Administration and M&E
Specialist appointed to the project and, by late-2006, the project's M&E activities were
able to provide basic information on implementation progress as well as project impacts
in line with the key indicators.


                                             8

          Quality and reliability of the data remains questionable. Some data on
implementation progress and KPIs seems to have been collected retroactively since 2004,
mainly on the intermediate outcome (output) level. Moreover, some monitoring
indicators were not clearly defined causing problems in interpreting the data collected7. It
is likely that such ambiguity also affected the quality of data collected by poorly trained
extension workers, as evidenced by inconsistencies and gaps encountered in monitoring
data made available to the ICRR team. Data on the PDO outcome indicators have been
reported since 2005 but information sources and methodology for collection and analysis
could not be traced by the ICRR team. In summary, there does not appear to have been a
systematic process for M&E put in place during most of the project's implementation
period. These shortcomings pose severe challenges to the ICRR team in analyzing the
project performance and the achievements of PDOs


2.4       Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

          Environmental Issues.                   These were rated as category B at appraisal. The
relatively small size of the irrigation systems to be rehabilitated and their geographical
dispersion implied that the impact of the project would be generally small and that the
project would provide a low-risk opportunity to build environmental expertise and
experience within the concerned Lao institutions. The project complied with the World
Bank's safeguard policies and financed training, materials, specialist technical assistance
and other support costs for raising awareness among farmers and extension staff,
improving linkages to supplement the National Malaria Program, encouraging the use of
Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and for monitoring the environmental impact of the
project.

          As envisaged, general Environmental Management Action Plans (EMAP) were
developed and approved for the irrigation rehabilitation works, rural access road
construction program and the water supply activities. These were translated into Lao and
included in the works contact documents, with the contractors being briefed on EMAP
requirements and instructed to minimize negative environmental impacts and to
implement mitigation measures adequately. However, it is clear that EMAPs need to be
integrated into the design and construction process, with environmental requirements
incorporated into construction activities, and not treated as stand-alone documents.

          The project also identified nine irrigation schemes (of the total 21 to be
rehabilitated) that were either close to existing National Biodiversity Conservation Areas
or could impact on local fisheries, and specific EMPs were undertaken for these schemes8
and specific plans also included in the construction contract documents. During the latter
part of the project, the Environmentalist Specialist TA prepared more detailed
Environmental Technical Guidelines to provide more specific guidance for construction
activities and these were included in the last civil works contracts. In addition, a Best
Construction Practices Study Tour was arranged for Project staff to observe current best
practices in Queensland, Australia.


7For example, the differences between command area, irrigable area and irrigated area were not always clear.
8Due to changes/cancellations during project implementation, only seven EMPs were required.



                                                                9

        Resettlement Issues. These aspects were anticipated at appraisal although the
magnitude of adverse impact was expected to be marginal in view of the focus of the
proposed works on rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems and the provision of rural
access tracks. It was also recognized that, during the course of construction, some land
acquisition may be required and compensation for both this as well as crop losses due to
either construction activities or long-term loss of land would need to be provided to
affected farmers. In compliance with IDA's safeguard policy, the project prepared a
Policy Framework for Land Acquisition, Involuntary Resettlement, and Rehabilitation of
Project Affected Persons which was endorsed by GOL and included in the Project
Implementation Manual (PIM). This required the preparation of RAPs for all the
irrigation schemes and access tracks and a good deal of time and effort were spent in their
preparation, approval by IDA, and subsequent implementation with appropriate
documentation. In some cases, due to construction delays or the need for renovation
works to damaged sections, supplementary plans were also required. Issues arose
concerning the detailed implementation of the RAPs, particularly in terms of the
available choices for land compensation, the need for increased consultation during the
planning process and the importance of both internal and external monitoring reporting.

        Financial Management. These aspects, although generally in compliance with
IDA procedures, were, as indicated above at Section 2.2, a major constraint to project
implementation through most of the project disbursement period. Areas identified for
improvement include reducing the layers of approval required to process payments,
tighter internal controls, and management of cash advances, expenditure documentation,
and better compliance with deadlines for Financial Management (FM) reports and audits.

        Procurement Management. Some issues were identified during the course of
World Bank supervision missions and were addressed by the PCO and the PPIOs
concerned. The main problems were related to lack of capacity and understanding of
procurement guidelines. Of particular concern was the case of possible collusion in
Attapeu province during the bidding process for two irrigation scheme contracts and
GOL and PCO acted in a timely manner to investigate and, subsequently, cancel the
procurement process. In June 2007, the Project Steering Committee (PSC) agreed to
develop and implement, together with the World Bank, a pilot Action Plan for
strengthening the transparency and accountability of procurement. This is intended to
provide improved disclosure of project procurement information, a complaints handling
system, certification of ethical conduct on the part of contractors, suppliers and
consultants, and improved shopping procedures. While this could have been an important
contribution to improving overall procurement performance, it has only been in place
during the final one-year extension of the project.


2.5     Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

        Management responsibility for the continued operation and maintenance of the
irrigation schemes rehabilitated under the project is vested with the WUGs. Although by
project closure, all WUGs were operating the irrigation schemes and water pumps, and
collecting irrigation fees, none of the schemes appear to have an established maintenance
plan. While there appears to be a clear understanding on the need for scheme members to


                                            10

contribute towards small repairs and administration expenses through the irrigation fee
and to pay directly, where applicable, for pumping costs, the structure and level of these
fees are insufficient (view Section 4). The post-construction role of government is
generally rather vague: while expected to assist the WUGs in both managing and
operating the schemes, organizing the production activities, as well as assisting with large
repairs, it is clear that the capacities of the provincial and district services are low and ­
for those provided with training under the project ­ liable to be dissipated through staff
transfers. Budgets are also very limited. and it is not evident that future major repair
requirements will be easily met

          The project's success in demonstrating improved technical packages has has been
partly attributable to two factors which are unlikely to continue after project completion:
(a) farmer training has been largely carried out by provincial-level Subject Matter
Specialists (SMS), with district extension workers (also trained by the SMS) making
regular (mostly weekly) follow-up visits; and (b) some farm inputs were provided for free
by the project for demonstration purposes to be repaid into Village Development Funds
(VDF)9. Such an intensive use of SMS resources is only possible at a limited scale and
when dealing with a limited number of farmers. For similar training to be provided for all
farmers in the irrigation schemes, as well as those who live in the same villages but do
not have access to irrigation, the extension staff at district levels will have to take over
the training functions performed earlier by the SMS. While the project was able to
finance operational budgets for extension staff at provincial and district levels, there
appears to be a high risk that insufficient budgetary allocations for continuing extension
activities will result in potential gains being lost. While provinces have indicated that
budgetary requests covering these requirements have been submitted, there was no
confirmation that these needs would be met.

          Arrangements for post-completion operation of the VIP component activities
remain somewhat undefined although the success of project interventions has reportedly
led NAFES to expand the approach as one of its main platforms for poverty reduction in
rural areas. In the project area, it appears that each province will be developing its own
strategy and approach to both institutionalizing the process and sustaining current
achievements. Thus, Saravane Province intends to build upon its VIP experience and is
already using both VIP staff as teachers for VDF training and successful VIP households
and villages as models for others. VIP development methodologies will also be shared
with other districts and other projects. Khammouane and Attopeu report less ambitious
plans for the future and it appears that existing VIP activities in these two provinces will
be handed over to different district offices: VDFs being transferred to the Lao Women's
Union (LWU) and schools to District Departments of Education. In Champassak, the
VDFs will be transferred to the District Department of Finance, probably a more secure
arrangement than the LWU. Whatever institutional arrangements are developed, it will
clearly be important that concerned staff at province and district levels are provided with
suitable training in such areas as PRA, micro-finance and bookkeeping.

                                        3. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES

3.1        Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

           The project objective remains relevant to the development objectives of the
country. The government's Sixth National Socio Economic Development Plan (2006-
2010) aims to partially eliminate seasonal hunger from rice scarcity by enhancing rice
productivity in the irrigated and rainfed lowlands of the country. The World Bank's
current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) supports the government's poverty
eradication strategy and, within this framework, seeks to strengthen opportunities for
farmers to increase productivity and trade through an improved enabling environment.
ADP's approach responds to these projected outcomes.


3.2        Achievement of Project Development Objectives

           The overall PDO was to reduce poverty by increasing and improving agricultural
production. Assessing the achievement of this is, however, constrained by the serious
deficiencies of the M&E data, especially in regard to the KPIs at outcome level
introduced during the MTR. Moreover, due to the delay in the completion of the
rehabilitation works, the full project benefits in terms of improved and increased
production only materialized towards the end of the project and its impact can only be
assessed on the basis of one year of full operation. Information has been derived from
field visits, interviews with project beneficiaries and analysis of existing agricultural data
(the increases in rice production and productivity also supports the existence of
significant increase in household income). Even though no rigorous evaluation of poverty
impact was made due to lack of adequate survey data, there is anecdotal evidence that
increase in production in project areas has resulted in additional incomes.

           Despite these caveats, available data suggests that the project met most of the
intermediate outcome (output) indicators and considerable progress was made on the
outcome indicators. The project rehabilitated 19 schemes with a total irrigated service
area of some 7,250 ha10 and exceeded the appraisal target in terms of total command area,
dry season irrigated area and rice yields (view Annex 3). As a result, rice production and
productivity increased substantially. The increase of rice yields is attributable to
improved water security, the use of improved seeds and the adoption of a broader
spectrum of improved agricultural practices introduced and disseminated by the project.
According to project statistics, more than 50 percent of trained farmers apply improved
practices. The benefits of rehabilitating the irrigation schemes and rural infrastructure
works, extended directly to some 6,350 members of water user groups. In addition, an
estimated 6,000 families in more than 200 villages benefited from household and
community-level investments and capacity building provided under the VIP component.

           Hence, the project has contributed to a significant increase of paddy production
and improved production methods. Levels of rice self-sufficiency reported have also
increased, with some 23 percent of farmers' families with a rice surplus, 60 percent with
rice self-sufficiency and 17 percent still facing a rice deficit. Although the targets

established at MTR have not yet been fully met, it represents a substantial improvement
over the baseline situation11.The diversification into non-rice crops has not yet taken
place at a significant scale, due to marketing problems and high profitability of rice. The
data on household income presented in project reporting are not considered reliable by
the ICRR team, for the reasons explained in Section 2.3. Nevertheless, increases in gross
margins and returns to labor for paddy production and the expansion of dry season paddy
production have a strong positive impact on household income and food security (view
Annex 3). The incidence of waterborne diseases has decreased considerably since 2000
which may be attributable at least in part to the project investments in water and
sanitation. Moreover, Village Development Committees and WUGs have been
established but their strength and sustainability remains doubtful (view Section 4).


3.3       Efficiency

          Total costs for rehabilitation of irrigation systems and access roads amount to
US$10.3 million (financial) and US$9.7 million (economic). With a total command area
of 7,400 ha, direct investment costs per hectare amount to US$1,394 (financial) and
US$1,314 (economic), which are within a reasonable range in South East Asia. If total
project costs excluding the VIP component are taken into account, unit costs increase to
US$2,513 (financial) or US$2,430 (economic) per ha.

          The Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was recalculated for the entire
project costs and for the project costs excluding the VIP component. Based on the total
project costs, the EIRR amounts to 18.9 percent and increases to 23.2 percent if VIP
related costs are excluded. The Net Present Value (NPV) amounts to US$3,389,262 and
US$4,667,962, respectively, at a discount rate of 12 percent. This compares favorably
with PAD estimates of an EIRR of 16.3 percent and an NPV of USD2.3 million and is
attributable to the slight overachievement of key output targets (see Annex 3, Table 1).

          The sensitivity of EIRR and NPV to changes in key parameters has been assessed
based on three scenarios including changes in rice prices and accelerated deterioration of
irrigation infrastructure. A 15 percent increase in paddy price would raise the EIRR up to
26.0 (31.8 percent) whereas a price decline of 15 percent would reduce it to 11.8 percent
(14.8 percent). In the latter case, the NPV would turn negative at a discount rate of 12
percent. This shows that the EIRR is highly sensitive to changes in paddy prices.
However, in view of the positive outlook for future rice prices at the time of the ICRR the
probability for this scenario it appears to be low.

decreases by 15% p.a.)


        Scenario 3 shows the effects of an accelerated decline of the irrigated area by 15
percent per year due to insufficient funding for maintenance and repair works and / or
poor quality of the works. Such scenario might not be unlikely in view of the insufficient
funding used for preventive maintenance, the limited "on the job training" which could
be provided to WUGs after the completion of the rehabilitation works and before the
closure of the project. It would resemble the situation observed in most irrigation
schemes in Lao PDR following construction or rehabilitation. However, as shown in
Table 2, the impact is modest with the EIRR remaining at an acceptable 15.4 percent
(19.9 percent). This result is partly attributable to the method of calculation whereby the
same rate of decline is also applied to the without project situation where it results in a
sharp reduction in dry season irrigation starting in year one. The reduction of the EIRR
would be more substantial if the scenario was applied to the total net benefits instead of
the incremental net benefits of the project. This highlights the importance of providing
ongoing support to WUGs to enhance their capacity to ensure system maintenance and of
adequate budget allocations at provincial level for repair works and operational costs of
extension staff.


3.4     Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        There is evidence that the project achieved improvement and increase in
agricultural production, and there are signs that this has likely led to some poverty
reduction (through income increases). All these improvements were achieved at an
estimated EIRR of 18.1 percent. Problems with procurement, financial management and
institutional implementation capacities were progressively addressed and, at closure, the
project was able to achieve full operation of all rehabilitated irrigation schemes, the
completion of all village water supplies and sanitation works in target villages, improved
levels of farm production skills and crop yields leading to increased farmers' incomes,
and improved livelihoods in VIP villages. Moreover, the project has taken up the
challenge work through existing government structures at various levels within the
context of an incipient decentralization process, rather than creating parallel structures.
Unfortunately, due to weak and incomplete M&E data and the absence of baseline and
impact surveys and the delayed completion of the civil works, the full benefits of the
project cannot be assessed with precision.

3.5       Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts


          (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The rehabilitation
of irrigation schemes and rural infrastructure in the project area has resulted in increased
agricultural production (principally rice) and positive effects on levels of poverty and
social well-being. However, the irrigation and agricultural services components of the
project did not have an explicit poverty targeting strategy to include the poorest
households within the villages. According to project design these households (i.e., the
landless) were to be reached through the VIP component. However, implementation of
the VIP component soon took a different approach focusing on poor non-irrigation
villages in the target districts to expand the geographic outreach of the project.

          No quantitative or qualitative data or studies are available to assess the intra-
community and intra-household impacts of the project, apart from the VIP component.
On the latter, two qualitative evaluations have been conducted12 which show a
considerable positive impact on household income and food security and empowerment
of beneficiary households and village organizations. These impacts have been especially
noticeable in those villages where several projects were implemented. While the VIP
component was successful at geographic targeting focusing on the poorest villages and
ethnic minority villages, its ability to target the poorest households within the villages
was mixed. Targeting outcomes depended on the approach taken by the District
Implementation Team and on the internal village organization and power structures. In
some villages with inclusive power structures and/or the facilitation of poverty-sensitive
DITs, activities were targeted at the poorest households whereas in other villages the
poorest were excluded13. Moreover, the VIP had no gender targeting strategy and, as a
result, the project's impacts were less than they could have been. Even woman-headed
households, which seem to make up a significant slice of the poor in sample villages and
are particularly vulnerable, received VIP assistance in only a few villages.

          (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening. The project was intended to support the
government's decentralization strategy and, in terms of institutional aspects, was
implemented in an evolving institutional environment. It has done this by working
through existing government structures and investing in staff capacity building and the
improvement of certain administrative procedures. It is clear that the staff training
provided by the project has enhanced skills and capacity of staff at provincial and district
levels in technical as well as administrative matters. The VIP Evaluation notes that the
project has increased the sensitivity of government staff at district and provincial level to
interact with the village population and their capacity to use PRA methods and other
bottom-up planning processes. Moreover, it has contributed to strengthening the relations
between government staff at District and Provincial levels. While it is certain that this
staff will be dispersed following project closure, it appears likely that their capacity will
continue to be available for further development activities carried out by the
decentralized agencies. In addition, the changes introduced by the project to

administrative procedures at both central and decentralized levels with a view to
accelerating over-long and cumbersome GOL practices will most likely remain in place ­
to the benefit of the country's future administration.

           Not applicable.


                         4. ASSESSMENT OF RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Substantial

           The risks to development outcome have been assessed in relation to short-,
medium- and long-term factors which encompass infrastructure, organizational
commitment, and institutional processes. In the medium- and long-term, there are three
main risks to the sustainability of the project's outcomes. These are:                                              (a) lack of
maintenance of irrigation systems in the newly devolved operating environment; (b)
decline of rice prices; and (c) lack of effective means to finance intensification of
irrigated agriculture.

           As mentioned in Section 2.5, although WUGs have been formed and trained in all
rehabilitated schemes, doubts remain about their ability to manage and maintain them
properly. Overall fee levels appear to be unrealistically low14 and the irrigation fee is
generally divided between the district (20 percent) and the village development fund (80
percent), with the latter allocating only some 15 percent to scheme maintenance15. These
funds will be insufficient to cover more than the most basic maintenance work and will
certainly fail to meet the costs of more important structural repairs or the provision of
spare parts for pumps and gates. All charges are levied on an area basis without
consideration of the crop irrigated or water consumption. Only one scheme has included
any means of measuring water consumption16 and it will be impossible to base future
irrigation fees on volumetric criteria without additional civil works. An additional
concern, reinforced by experience elsewhere in the country, is that maintenance is
normally viewed as equivalent to repair and little consideration is given to routine,
periodic preventive maintenance of irrigation systems (canals, drains, access roads, and
structures). In summary, there appears to be little medium- to long-term prospect that the
cycle of under-maintenance followed by rehabilitation substituting for deferred
maintenance will be broken. This will inevitably compromise the primary development
outcome for the irrigation scheme beneficiaries.

           The sustainability of on-farm benefits through the adoption of improved inputs
hinges upon the future development of such key determinants for the profitability of
irrigated paddy production as paddy prices, availability, and costs of quality inputs, and
access to sufficient working capital to finance these inputs. After only one year of
irrigated cropping with improved technologies on fully rehabilitated schemes, it is


14For pump scheme, water fee is 150 kg of Paddy rice to 200 kg of paddy rice per ha per season; for gravity schemes, 60,000 kips per
ha to 100,000 kips per ha is collected in dry season.

difficult to assess the sustainability of the on-farm results, especially in view of the recent
fluctuations in rice and fertilizer prices. Taking into account price projections for rice
from early 2008, the price level during the latter half of the project implementation period
(2005 - 2008) is likely to prevail or even increase in the medium- to long-term. If these
projections hold true, basic profitability prospects for paddy production will remain
favorable. However, even if rice prices are to remain favorable, farmers will still require
access to sufficient working capital in order to purchase fertilizer and improved seeds.
Poorer farmers particularly can rarely afford to purchase improved inputs, resulting in
only a partial adoption of recommended technology packages.

        Limited access to credit has been identified as an important constraint during
project implementation, although attenuated by the provision, at no cost, of limited
amounts of inputs for demonstrations and initial adoption purposes, to be repaid into the
VDF. Moreover, farmers were trained in establishing and managing savings and credit
groups and managing VDFs. Unfortunately, no data is available to assess the outreach
and sustainability of these informal financing mechanisms and it is questionable whether
district extension staff have the necessary skills for training farmers in financial
management and record keeping. It can therefore be assumed that VDFs are, at best, only
a partial solution to the farm-financing problem. Sustained efforts are needed to improve
the performance of village-based financial institutions and of formal financial
institutions.


                5. ASSESSMENT OF BANK AND BORROWER PERFORMANCE

5.1     Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        IDA performance at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. Project design was
consistent with the CAS that was current at preparation, with its fundamental objective of
poverty reduction and, in the rural sector, its focus on investing in rural development and
natural resource management, improving agricultural productivity, and supporting rural
infrastructure development.      The PAD acknowledged the experience of other IDA
operations in the country with regard to weak institutional capacity and public
expenditure management but these problems were repeated under the project. It is
believed that the design should have been based on a fuller capacity assessment, in
addition to the specific areas of procurement and financial management that were
examined at appraisal. This would have enabled the design to include a more clearly
articulated capacity development strategy with clearly defined interventions, training
requirements and indicators based on prior capacity assessments.

        In particular, the implementation schedule for the civil works should have been
set out more realistically in view of the prevailing institutional capacity constraints.
Detailed preparatory activities for the initial phase of civil works such as surveys,
beneficiary selection and the preparation of RAPs and engineering designs should have




                                               17

been prepared during project design to a level to permit the preparation of draft contract
documents to be assessed during appraisal and finalised prior to project effectiveness.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        The overall supervision quality is rated as generally moderately satisfactory.
Between Project Launch in May 2001 and Closure in June 2008, four TTLs have been
responsible for the project. IDA supervision missions have visited the project reasonably
regularly and these also included specialist inputs from the World Bank's Bangkok office
staff or consultants, for both following-up on key actions as well as assisting training
workshops ­ particularly in the areas of procurement, financial management,
rural/irrigation engineering and settlement safeguards. However, there appears to have
been some inconsistencies in responses from IDA staff to project requests during the
initial phases of the project, in terms of both timeliness and guidance, and the
"satisfactory" status of project performance reported by IDA supervision missions from
mid-2001 to end-2004 appears over-optimistic in view of overall project progress.

        After the MTR in April 2005, there was an increase in the intensity of IDA
supervision missions, with the skills mix of team members significantly increased to
address the continuing severe implementation delays and persistent financial
management and procurement problems, as well as the problems of agricultural and
organizational developments.        Performance reporting was generally more fully-
documented with systematic attention given to follow-up the compliance status of earlier
action plans. However, insufficient attention has been paid to putting an effective M&E
system in place and building the capacity of project staff to collect and analyze the
required data in a proper way.

        It also has to be mentioned that ADP's early implementation problems were not
reflected in the Development Objective and Implementation Progress ratings in the ISRs
(previously PSRs). The performance of the Development Objectives (DO) was generally
rated as being Satisfactory, with a Moderately Satisfactory rating in three ISRs in 2006.
The Implementation Progress (IP) was rated Satisfactory for most of the implementation
period, with an ISR in June 2005 reporting a Moderately Satisfactory status following the
MTR and the adjustments agreed at that point. Thereafter two ISRs in 2006 reported a
Moderately Unsatisfactory IP rating, improving again at the end of 2006 to Moderately
Satisfactory and Satisfactory until project closure.       Reasons for the Moderately
Unsatisfactory ratings in 2006 were attributable mainly to: (a) Financial Management
aspects that were not addressed despite written commitment from NAFES and project
approval procedures had not been streamlined and hampered project implementation. In
addition, capacity in financial management remained critically weak; and (b) under
design of the works and poor review by the PCO and consultants, and lack of timely field
supervision of construction during last dry season for the Rural Infrastructure component.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance


Rating: Moderately Satisfactory



                                             18

        The overall World Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory. Over-
optimistic design targets are confirmed, to some extent, by the implementation delays
experienced during the project. Other factors negatively affecting project implementation
were, however, generally identified and assessed in a reasonably timely manner by IDA
supervisions and assistance in resolving problems provided through either direct by IDA
staff support or consultant inputs and training.       These were generally strengthened
following the MTR mission and were effective in assisting the Borrower to fully achieve
the project's targets.


5.2 Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

        The overall Borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory. While
ADP was considered by Government to be a priority project and an important component
of its decentralization strategy, there was a lack of commitment in staffing the central
PCO after its transfer to NAFES and this resulted in serious shortcomings in project
management capacity and implementation delays. In particular, failure to implement
actions agreed with earlier IDA supervision missions led the GOL to be in violation of
several sections of the DCA and the project was downgraded to a Moderately
Unsatisfactory status during 2006. Furthermore, financial management constraints,
particularly due to the weak capacity of finance staff at both the PCO and PPIOs, were
persistent during almost all the project disbursement period. M&E systems were set up
prior to the MTR but could not be implemented. Even after the MTR, the PCO and PPIOs
continued to have difficulty in providing such information in a timely and consistent
manner and making practical use of data collected to enable impact monitoring of the
project to be achieved.

        Coordination of activities among implementing agencies at the provincial and
district levels, and between the district and provincial levels and the central level was also
weak and adversely affected implementation, particularly in the areas of financial
management, monitoring and reporting. The weak capacities of, and inputs provided by,
the Provincial Irrigation Services (PIS) also resulted in severe delays in the completion of
revised engineering designs in two provinces late in the project's life. The recruitment of
specialist technical assistance was badly delayed until May 2003 and, once in place, was
often used by the PCO and implementing agencies on a rather ad hoc basis. However,
PCO performance improved considerably during the second half of 2006 which justified
the projects extension by one year and allowed the completion of civil works during
2007.


 6. LESSONS LEARNED (BOTH PROJECT-SPECIFIC AND OF WIDE GENERAL APPLICATION)

(d)              Advanced stage of readiness for initial construction activities should
        be part of project design and appraisal. If early project activities include
        construction works based on bidding procedures, sufficient time and financial
        resources should be provided during preparation to permit interaction with
        farmers, the preparation of RAPs in response to the requirements of settlement
        safeguard policies, and the preparation of construction designs and draft contract


                                              19

     documents for a first-year time slice. These should be reviewed at appraisal.
     Tenders should then be issued as soon as feasible after loan effectiveness.

(e)           Institutional capacity assessments should underpin project design.
     Project design should be informed by a broad and deep analysis of institutional
     capacities and a specific capacity development strategy should be developed as
     part of preparation. This should also include a capacity development framework
     providing a set of proposed interventions and indicators which respond to the
     capacity constraints identified at the different levels of project implementation
     and for the staff concerned.

(f)          Timing and skills mix of TA can improve overall project
    management. Project experience shows that the CTA support to the PCO should
     be more continuous and that the CTA's expertise should provide support for
     project and program management, including financial management, planning and
     reporting, office and contract management, and experience of M&E systems.
     Similarly, inputs of field-based TA staff should be programmed to provide a more
     stable, continual support for project staff. Consideration should be given to
     instituting regular Borrower/Bank joint reviews of the performance of any TA
     inputs provided under the Credit.

(g)          Improved access to marketing and farm finance are important
    elements of agricultural development. Marketing problems appear to have both
     hindered crop diversification, especially for perishable crops like vegetables, as
     well as prevented a transition from glutinous to non-glutinous rice. Issues
     concerning access to working capital are discussed in Section 4 and while both
     aspects have been acknowledged during project implementation, they could only
     be addressed marginally within the given project design. More attention should
     be given to marketing and farm finance in future irrigation project designs,
     perhaps at the expense of other components such as VIP (in non-irrigation
     villages) which are only marginally linked to the main thrust of the project: the
     extension and intensification of irrigated farming.

(h)          Improved on-farm water management is a key element of irrigated
    agriculture production. Improvements to irrigation infrastructure should
     provide opportunities for both expanding areas under dry season irrigation at
     schemes where water resources are limiting and/or enabling diversification of
     irrigated cropping. However, both opportunities require improved on-farm water
     management but little attention has been given to this aspect. Indeed, this appears
     to be a general characteristic of the irrigation sector in the country and probably
     needs to be tackled in the context of a sub-sector program which also addresses
     the question of institutionalizing farm irrigation management and sustainable
     irrigation management transfers.

(i)          M&E systems should match the capacity of project staff to collect,
    analyze and use the data. Efforts to establish an M&E system fluctuated
     between being over- and under-designed and serious issues of data availability
     and quality reduced its usefulness during project implementation and for assessing
     the project results and outcomes. Moreover, considerable resources were used


                                           20

        under the project for data collection as part of the village-level PRA exercises but
        this data was not properly analyzed and presented in a form that would serve as a
        baseline for the M&E system. It would be preferable that simpler, less resource-
        demanding approaches should be used, in view of limited extension staff
        availability, and that M&E systems should be closely matched to analytical
        capacities and national reporting systems in order to avoid duplication and ensure
        full ownership among participating agencies.

                                   ANNEX 2. OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT

          Component 1: Rural Infrastructure (US$ 10.97 million, US$10.75 million)

          Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

          This component is composed of three sub-components: (a) rehabilitation of
existing small- and medium-sized, gravity- and pump-fed irrigation schemes;                                                (b)
construction of access tracks between the irrigation schemes and villages or rural road
network; and (c) provision of village water supplies (shallow wells and boreholes,
equipped with hand pumps) and sanitation facilities (household and school latrines). The
component outputs were modified during implementation from levels projected in the
PAD as a result of detailed studies undertaken for implementation, intermediate
developments, and contractor non-performance.

          At appraisal, key performance output indicators for the first sub-component were:
(a) rehabilitation of 7,070 ha, leading to a 20 percent increase in cropping intensity; and
(b) increase in paddy yields per hectare.                            At completion, 19 schemes had been
rehabilitated with a service area of 7,400 ha17, the cropping intensity reached
181percent18 (an increase of 66percent over the 109 percent level of the PAD estimate),
and average paddy yields have increased consistently throughout the project area
(ranging from 7 percent in Attapeu to some 30 percent in Khammouane for dry season
cropping).

          Output indicators for the second sub-component were the rehabilitation of around
165 km of access tracks to provide improved access to markets and reduced traffic costs.
At completion, some 104 km were constructed and, in most cases, the works were
included as part of the civil works contracts for the respective irrigation scheme
rehabilitation. The reduction in total length was largely due to the re-evaluation of
proposals at one scheme ­ Nondeng in Saravane Province ­ which had originally been 60
km length. The new works were reduced to 8.3km with other access provided along
canal banks as part of the rehabilitation works.

          Indicators for the third sub-component consisted of the number of households
with access to safe/potable drinking water supplies and the incidence of water borne
diseases. Implementation was based on a demand-driven process focusing on water
supplies from tubewells and shallow wells equipped with manual hand pumps, and the
provision of some 5,000-pit latrines. Most provinces reached their targets with some 246
wells constructed, although shallow wells proved non-viable in Saravane and, in
Champasak, the target were only partially met. However, the target for household pit
latrines was exceeded by some 11 percent, with some 5,630 constructed plus 44 school
latrines. On the basis that a typical water supply system can cater for some 25-30
households, it is estimated that project coverage could reach between 6,100 and 7,400
families.

          Component 2: Village Investment for the Poor (US$ 2.02 million, US$1.80
          million)

          Achievements under this component are rated satisfactory.

          This component was a block grant to be allocated at district level for
implementing small-scale, village-level, demand-driven activities identified during the
course of PRA exercises conducted in 15 of the poorest villages not benefiting from
irrigation rehabilitation works. Fifteen districts were targeted and at appraisal, it was
foreseen that annual disbursements would amount to some US$20,000 per district. Key
output indicators included the number of beneficiary household groups, the number of
ethnic women and minority groups submitting and having proposals accepted, and the
number of sub-projects ranked satisfactory by village communities.

          The component was carried out in three phases: two initial phases (March 2002 to
February 2004 and February 2004 to February 2005) funded from the JSDF (US$1.14
million) and a third phase (March 2005 to June 2007, with some activities extended to
final completion in June 2008) funded from the IDA Credit ­ (0.326 million). VIP
activities were carried out in 204 villages with a total number of 540 activities, divided
into community and household level activities. The main community activities were
(with numbers): Village Development Funds (134); schools (53); water supply (33); rice
bank (10); markets (7). The main household activities were (with numbers): pigs and
goats (82), cattle (75), buffalo (63), poultry, fish and vegetable production (61), and
handicrafts (6). The benefits arising from the VIP activities include both improvements
to the quality of life due to the improved social infrastructure, as well as improved food
security by such measures as the provision of animals, fish and poultry, as well as
establishing markets, trading groups and revolving funds.                                       At appraisal, the average
proportion of poor households in the sample villages was 38 percent, and at completion, it is 18
percent.19     VDFs were VIP's most effective tool for reducing poverty, providing an
opportunity to make small loans for low rates of interest which many villagers used to
fund a variety of micro-enterprises. VDFs were also the single most popular VIP activity,
with 134 established in VIP's 204 villages.

          While the project was reasonably successful in targeting ethnic minority groups
(average of 3.3 VIP activities per ethnic village, compared to an average of 2.4 per Lao
village and 3 for mixed villages), it was less successful at targeting women. Some
benefited directly from handicraft activities and tailoring though more benefited from
traditional small animal raising activities (pigs and poultry). Also, while some villages
selected their poorest people for activities, and these were either successful or failed due
to the inability of the poor households to pay back loans, in many cases the poor
households did not want the risk of participating, as repayments were perceived by them
as difficult.



          Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Implementation Support (US$
          5.22 million, US$8.28 million)

          Achievements under this component are rated moderately satisfactory.

19Source: ADP Project Completion Report by GOL: not all this decrease can be attributed to VIP as there have been other factors as
well. However, part of the improvement in every sample village is attributed by the villagers themselves to VIP.



                                                                25

         This component is composed of three sub-components: (a) strengthening the
capacity of provincial and district-level PAFSO/DAFSO in both providing technical
services to farmers and in carrying out a program of on-farm adaptive research and
demonstrations, and to establish and strengthen water users associations at the irrigation
schemes being rehabilitated under the project; (b) strengthening the capacity of PAFSOs
and the provincial offices of STEA in monitoring environmental aspects of the project
and providing appropriate guidance to project stakeholders on improved environmental
management; and (c) strengthening central level project coordination (PCO) and the
PPIO. This included technical assistance and training in planning, project and financial
management, and the provision of vehicles and equipment.


         At appraisal, key performance output indicators for the first sub-component were:
(i) establishment of a Central Extension Training Unit (CETU) and four provincial-level
PETUs; (ii) the upgrading of DAFSO technical staff into generalist farming systems
extension workers; (iii) implementation of adaptive research programmes and on-farm
demonstrations of improved technology; (iv) the number of farmers trained and adopting
improved agricultural practices, and (v) the number of WUGs taking over responsibility
for irrigation scheme operation and maintenance.

         The CETU and four PETUs were established with the four centers including
meeting and training halls and dormitories to accommodate 40-50 trainees.
Construction/renovation works were completed in 2006 for the central level PCO/NAFES
offices and for three PPIOs and provincial training centers, and the following year for the
PPIO and training centre in Champasak. Other renovation works were also carried out at
the 15 DIT offices. The progressive introduction of the Lao Extension Approach (LEA)
during implementation was supported by the project's training and study tour
programme.         Overall, the on-farm research and demonstration activities and related
training were identified and selected on the basis of the results of PRA exercises and
recommended technologies from the National Agriculture and Poverty Research
(NAFRI) and NAFES. A total of 319 agriculture trainings involving 934 training days
and 21,511 trainees, including 4,894 women, were conducted between 2003-2008. This
training focused mainly on rice production technologies, dry-season cash crop
production, agriculture extension systems, livestock production, soil improvement, and
village development fund operations, detailed as follows:

         (j)         Rice Production technologies: This covered the selection of improved rice
             varieties for the specific locations of the irrigation schemes, and the extension
             of rice cultivation technologies (land preparation, nurseries, transplanting,
             water management, pest control, and post harvesting). A total of 99 on-farm
             research and demonstration plots were implemented with the participation of
             20,900 farmers20 (52 plots in dry season and 47 plots in rainy season). Other
             rice cultivation technologies were also introduced and demonstrated: rice
             direct seeding and SRI (le Systéme de Riziculture Intensive) System of Rice
             Intensification.




20Total number of farmers, with most of farmers participating in the trials more than once.



                                                               26

          (k)       Farmer-level rice seed multiplication: Foundation seeds were procured
                from the MAF agriculture stations and distributed to farmers. Use of
                improved rice seed in the rainy season is rapidly being adopted by the farmers
                and increased from 10 percent in 200021 to 49 percent in 2007 (reported to be
                as high as 80 percent in Saravane and Champasak Provinces). For dry season
                rice, 95 percent of the areas were covered by the improved rice varieties in
                2007, an increase from about 52 percent in 2004.


          (l)       Integrated Pest Management: Farmers were trained in both the safe use of
                chemicals and botanical applications for pest control. Gallmidge was a
                serious rice pest in Khammouane province and has been successfully
                controlled by the IPM methods introduced by the Project. Thirteen IPM
                demonstration activities (6 for dry season crops and 7 for rainy season crops)
                were conducted with the participation of 723 farmers.


          (m)       Cash crop production: Non-rice crop demonstrations included dry season
                irrigated soybean production using zero tillage technology, as well as corn,
                watermelon and vegetable production. A total of 80 on-farm research and
                demonstrations were conducted with the participation of 1,964 farmers (56
                plots in dry season and 24 plots in rainy season). The adoption of dry season
                soybean production has been limited due to the relatively low price offered in
                comparison with recent raddy price rises . Similarly, only very modest areas
                                                                       22

                of dry season corn, sweet corn, watermelon, and vegetables have been
                cultivated in the dry season.


          (n)       Soil Improvement: Twenty-eight on-farm research and demonstrations of
                soil improvement methods (8 in the rainy season) were conducted with the
                participation of 467 farmers. These covered such areas as: compost making
                and utilization, bio-fertilizer production and utilization, application of the
                semi-direct technology (zero tillage), and crop rotation of rice and legumes.
                While bio-fertilizer and compost production have been adopted by farmers for
                fruit tree plantations and vegetable production, there has been limited use of
                them in paddy cultivation due to the large amount of raw material required.


          (o)       Animal Feed Production: Twenty-seven on-farm research demonstration
                plots of fodder crops and feed corn (12 in the dry season) were conducted with
                the participation of 460 farmers. Adoption has been low as the free grazing
                continues to be practiced and recent high paddy prices have rendered other
                crops uncompetitive.

          (p)        Fruit Tree Plantation: This activity was intended for villagers with no
              irrigated land and 22 demonstration plots were conducted with the
              participation of 328 farmers. Improved variety fruit tree seedlings (mangoes,
              jujube, longan, lichees, coconuts, etc) were provided by the project and all
              fruit tree plantations are in good condition, with production expected after
              completion.


          (q)       Livestock Development: A total of 68 demonstrations of improved
              livestock activities were conducted with the participation of 5,290 farmers,
              two of them for cattle raising and the remainder for small ruminants and
              poultry. Surveys conducted in 28 project villages show that the number of
              animals has increased due to the regular vaccination program with villagers
              paying for the vaccines.

          (r)        Fishery: Twenty-one demonstrations were conducted with the
              participation of 161 farmers covering fish growing and fingerling production.
              Farmers' adoption rate has been high and fishpond areas have been extended
              by 33 percent compared with the 2004 status.


          (s)       Village Development Fund (VDF): VDF groups have been established and
              are operating well in 77 villages with a total membership of 4,400 and a total
              capital of 2,633.65 Million Kips (US$312,000). The main contribution to the
              VDFs came from the post-harvest reimbursement of the cost of agriculture
              inputs provided by the project to the farmers.


          WUGs were established during the period late 2002 to mid-2005 at all the
schemes23 rehabilitated by the project. These consist of 6,347 full family members with a
further 635 temporary WUG members cultivating for dry season rice production through
temporary tenant contracts with landowners. Some 272 Farmer Irrigation Groups (FIG)
were formed and strengthened by the project and training in support of WUG operations
was also provided, as follows: WUG rules and regulations (4,290 trainees),
environmental management, land use management for the irrigated land, land use
contract management for tenant and land owners, gender issues, water pump
maintenance, water user group fee collection and WUG fund management, etc. (92 days
of training involving 1,155 trainees, including 269 women).24 While there has been
extensive training provided, the delay in completion of the irrigation scheme
rehabilitation works reportedly resulted in a reduced level of awareness of WUG
structures among farmers25. However, during the 2007-08 dry seasons, all WUGs were
actively operating in water management, water fee collection and land use management.

          Key performance output indicators at appraisal for the second sub-component
consisted of:         (a) regular monitoring of the project for environmental impacts; (b)


23Except for one where a Water User Association had been established prior to its inclusion in the project.

24Total numbers of the trainees, with farmers usually participating in more than one training.

improved understanding of the impacts of irrigation development on fisheries and other
environmental concerns; and (c) conduct of village-level dissemination on environmental
issues. The PAD required that specific EMPs be carried out for those schemes that
appeared to be particularly sensitive in terms of fisheries and wetlands considerations. Of
the nine schemes indicated at appraisal, three schemes were cancelled or changed and one
was replaced. Specific EMPs were prepared for seven schemes, including a study on fish
migration patterns, and these were approved by the Bank. The specific plans were also
included in the subsequent contract documents.         In addition, a general EMAP was
prepared to cover all rural infrastructure works (irrigation rehabilitation, rural access road
construction, and rural water supply schemes). A Lao version was prepared and included
in all construction contract documents with the requirement that the contractor minimize
negative environmental impacts and implement recommended mitigation measures.
Training in environmental awareness was also provided to site engineers, contractors, and
provincial staff of STEA, and an overseas study tour was organized to observe best
construction    practices.  Conclusions     from    this  tour    included    the   following
recommendations:

    ·   early attention to good design practice in relation to future construction;
    ·   EMPs and EMAPs need to be fully integrated into design and construction
        phases;
    ·   more use of technical and environmental specifications in construction contract
        documents;
    ·   EM considerations as part of pre-qualification criteria;
    ·   use of "hold points" in contracts for intermediate controls; and
    ·   contract payments to be linked to monitoring of quality and compliance with EA
        standards.

        In terms of implementation support, the key performance output indicators at
appraisal consisted of: (a) timely actions on government follow-up and implementation
coordination; (b) key operations manual developed, applied and refined according to
requirements; (c) number of project staff with improved competencies on project
implementation, M&E, procurement processing and financial management; and (d)
M&E system developed and timely monitoring reports and evaluation studies produced.

        Project Coordination: The PCO was set up early in the project but was not fully
staffed until the project was well underway, particularly in the areas of financial
management and M&E. At closure, it consisted of nine officers including the Project
Coordinator, and the equivalent staff at provincial level totaled some 48 staff. Technical
Assistance was provided during implementation by key specialists recruited at
international and regional levels, as well as national staff to reinforce the PPIOs, as
follows:

        Training: Of the 416 training and study tour sessions organized during the
project, staff directly associated to the project benefited from 166 sessions involving 545
days of training for a total of 4,352 trainees. This total included 712 women. On-the-job
training in project management and coordination was provided at 18 sessions covering 39
days and involving 578 participants (73 female). Similarly, monitoring and evaluation
training was provided at 11 sessions covering 55 days and involving 396 participants (55
female).     In general, less training was provided than foreseen at appraisal due,
principally, to delays in budget disbursement.

        Vehicles and equipment: At central level, 4WD vehicles (8 nos.), motorcycles
(23 nos.) and a minibus, plus office equipment were provided. PPIOs were also provided
with 4WD vehicles (16 nos.), motorcycles (107 nos.), and a similar mix of office
equipment.

        Monitoring and Evaluation: The initial M& E system developed by the project
in late 2003 appears to have been overly complex and did not facilitate consistent
reporting of project activities. A refined set of impact indicators were developed at MTR
and a simplified M&E manual was also developed. The system was fully functional in
2006.

                     ANNEX 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Summary of Key Findings
    ·  The project has exceeded its physical targets regarding total command area,
       irrigated area during the dry season and productivity increases. However,
       diversification into non-glutinous rice and non-rice crops has been marginal;

    ·  Unit costs for irrigation rehabilitation of USD 1,314 (direct investment costs) and
       USD 2,431 (total project costs excluding VIP) are within a reasonable range in
       South-East Asia;

    ·  The analysis has been constrained by severe data limitations which made it
       difficult to track key output and outcome indicators especially during the first
       years of project implementation, and to estimate some of the project benefits;

    ·  An EIRR of 23.2 percent and NPV of USD 4.6 million (excluding VIP) are above
       PAD estimates and suggest that economic benefits of the project are satisfactory;

    ·  Sensitivity analysis shows high sensitivity of project benefits to fluctuations of
       rice prices. Ne vertheless, current medium-term outlooks for rice prices and
       limited risk of project benefits being eroded by falling prices; and

    ·  Accelerated deterioration of irrigation infrastructure due to poor maintenance and
       repairs pose a significant threat to sustaining project benefits.


Introduction

       This annex describes the benefits and costs of the project as they have been
assessed at the end of project implementation and compares them with appraisal
estimates.   To the extent possible, benefits have been quantified using available
monitoring data and information gathered during fieldwork. However, the re-assessment
of the economic and financial impact of the project in line with the assumptions and
methodology used at appraisal was constrained by the following limitations:

    ·  unavailability of the PAD working paper on Economic and Financial Analysis
       with detailed crop budgets and other computations and respective explanation of
       the underlying assumptions and methodology. The analysis had to rely on
       Annexes 4 and 5 of the PAD which present some overall results and general
       assumptions;

    ·  lack of 2001 baseline data on relevant indicators: The baseline survey consists
       mainly of a compilation of secondary data providing detailed statistics on social
       and demographic indicators at district level, but with little information on farming
       practices such as use and costs of inputs, yields and output prices in the project
       area (at least no such document could be assessed by the ICRR team);

    ·  limited availability of monitoring data: Disconnect between the baseline data from
       PAD and M&E data: The M&E system has only been established after the MT
       and no data is available for the period before 2004. The system was initially
       overdesigned and underwent several revisions. The final reporting format was
       only put in place in late 2006 and some data seems to have been collected



                                             31

       retroactively back to 2004. Some performance indicators established in the PAD
       such as the area under supplementary irrigation are missing; and

    ·  poor quality of monitoring data: Despite considerable cleaning and recollection of
       data, inconsistencies and gaps persist. Moreover, the indicators collected are not
       always clearly defined causing some interpretation problems. Such ambiguity has
       also affected the quality of data collection carried out by poorly trained extension
       workers. As a result, M&E data has to be treated with caution and only provides
       a rough idea about outputs and achievements.


Main Project Benefits Projected and Achieved

        According to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD), the following benefits were
envisaged:

    ·   expansion of dry season irrigated area from 2,816 ha to 4,455 ha;
    ·   expansion of supplemental irrigation during the wet season from 1,373 ha to
        7,070 ha;
    ·   yield increases due to introduction of improved seeds, fertilizer application and
        other agronomic practices during both seasons: from 2.0 t to 3.5 tons /ha, during
        wet season, and from 3.8t to 4.4 t during the dry season;
    ·   complete shift from glutinous to non-glutinous rice season during the dry season;
    ·   diversification into non-rice crops during the dry season from none to 273 ha of
        maize, 267 ha of soybeans and 91 ha of vegetables; and
    ·   increased income from small livelihoods activities funded under the VIP
        component.

        Table 1 summarizes some key output and outcome indicators comparing the
baseline situation, PAD estimates and actual achievements at the end of the project
implementation period. The project has exceeded its physical targets regarding total
command area, irrigated area during the dry season and yields. However, due to the
delays in completing civil works, the full project benefits only materialized during the
last project year. Table 2 shows some output and outcome indicators as monitored by the
project over for the period from 2004 ­ 08 during which civil works, training and
extension activities were implemented at farm level. It shows that 272 FIGs with a total
of 6,347 members have been formed by 2008. Dry season paddy cultivation had declined


                                              32

considerably from 2,816 ha in 2001 to 1,421 ha in 2004, due to lack of system
maintenance26. During construction, the cultivated area declined further to a low of
1,283ha in 2005/06, followed by a sharp increase up to 5,635ha in 2007/08, after
construction works had been completed.

          Improved rice varieties were introduced by the project covering about half of the
wet season area and almost the entire dry season paddy area in 2007/08. Yields increased
from between 2 and 2.4 tons at appraisal to between 3 tons and 4.2 tons during the wet
season. Dry season yields went up from 3.8 tons to between 4.2 tons and 5.3 tons during
the dry season, depending on technology levels. Paddy cultivation during the wet season
covers the entire command area of 7,400 ha of the 19 rehabilitated schemes (including
Samong I).

          Despite these improvements in rice production technologies, no significant shift
from glutinous to non-glutinous varieties has occurred and the overwhelming majority of
farmers continue to grow glutinous rice varieties. Moreover, diversification into non-rice
crops has been marginal (119 ha in 20007/08, 19 percent of appraisal target), despite
considerable on farm demonstration and training activities by the project. The main
reason for the limited diversification appears to be related to the difficulties in marketing
of non-rice crops, especially for perishable crops like vegetables.

Estimation of Incremental Benefits

          Incremental benefits have been calculated by comparing the with project and
without project scenarios, ex ante and ex post, over a 20 years period starting 2001. Two
adjustments have been made to the ex ante without-project scenario of the PAD:

     ·    increase of the planted area during the wet season: The PAD projects a total
          cultivated area during the wet season of 5,143 ha throughout the entire period of
          analysis for the without project situation, despite a command area of 7,070 ha.
          According to monitoring data, the cultivated wet season area was 7,210 ha in
          2004 and further increased to 7,464 ha in 2007. Project staff gave several
          possible explanations for this increase, none of which can really be attributed to

           the project27. In the absence of monitoring data, the PAD reported area is used for
           with and without project scenario until 2003 and the M&E data since 2004; and

     ·     deterioration of the irrigated area: the PAD assumes a decline of wet season
           irrigated area from 1,373 ha to 917 ha at the end of project life, due to improper
           maintenance, which is equivalent to a 2 percent annual decline. Based on the
           empirical evidence in the LAO irrigation sector, a decline of 10 percent p.a. is
           used as base case for the without project scenario.

           Incremental net benefits have been estimated by subtracting net benefits of the
adjusted without project scenario from the net benefits with project. Incremental net
benefits have been quantified based on the following project achievements:

     ·     paddy yield increases during dry and wet season; and
     ·     expansion of irrigated area during the dry season.

           Given the absence of monitoring data on the area under supplementary irrigation,
the impact of wet season irrigation on crop yields could not be measured. According to
project staff, supplementary irrigation only has an impact in years with a dry spell during
the rainy season and none scripted has occurred during the project implementation
period.        Moreover, it would difficult to disaggregate the impact of supplementary
irrigation from other project interventions such as improved seeds and better crop
management practices including fertilizer application. Therefore, the effects of improved
water security and better agricultural practices are reflected jointly in the crop budgets.
The net benefits of non-rice crops have not been quantified view of their marginal
importance. Lack of appropriate M&E data prevented a quantification of the incremental
net benefits of the VIP component.


Crop Budgets

           In view of the predominance of paddy production, crop budgets were used for
assessing the incremental benefits instead of farm models. For the without project
scenario, crop budgets were prepared based on the yields given in the PAD: 2 tons for
wet season rainfed paddy (CB 1), 2.5 tons for paddy with supplementary irrigation (CB
2) and 3.8 tons (CB 3) for dry season paddy.

           For the with project situation, two different technology levels have been modeled
for each cropping season:

     ·     wet season medium (CB 4) with an average yield of approximately 3 tons due to
           improved water management and improved rice cultivation practices;
     ·     wet season high (CB 5) with an average yield of approximately 4.2 tons due to
           and improved rice cultivation practices including the use of improved seeds and
           some fertilizer (in non-flood prone areas);
     ·     dry season medium (CB 6) with an average yield of approximately 4.2 tons due to
           improved seeds some fertilizer use (150 kg, half of the recommended doses); and


27Project staff gives different explanations for the difference in wet season cultivated area between the PAD and the M&E data,
including the possibility of underreporting of wet season calculated area at appraisal, tightening of the Thai immigration policy in
2004 increasing the rural labour availability combined with increasing paddy prices at that time.



                                                                   34

    ·   dry season high (CB 7) with an average yield of approximately 5.3 tons due to the
        use of improved seeds and the recommended amount of fertilizer (300kg).

        Table 3 shows increases in returns to land and family labor during both seasons.
Returns to family labor are between 173 percent and 360 percent above the rural wage
rate. Returns to land and family labor increased especially during the wet season.

        Crops budgets were based on data and information provided by project staff at
central and provincial level and crosschecked during field visits. Input use and yields
reflect average levels for the four provinces over the project implementation period. All
prices and cost are expressed in domestic currency constant 2008 prices and converted
into USD at the prevailing foreign exchange rate of 8,600 Kip/USD. For the base case, a
paddy price of Kip 1,848 has been used for the wet season reflecting the average price in
the project area for the 2005 ­ 2008 periods in real terms. It has been calculated based on
the current prices received from the PPIOs and adjusted by the respective CPI rates.
Changes in real terms have been minor during the period fluctuating between Kip 1,596
in 2005 and Kip 2,158 in 2007. Paddy prices for earlier years (2002 ­ 2004) were not
available for the project area but most of the incremental costs and benefits at farm level
accrued between 2005 -08. Dry season rice is of lower quality and therefore mainly used
for noodle and beer manufacturing. Average prices during the dry season tend to be
about 10 percent below wet season price.

        Fertilizer prices are based on average farm gate prices in the project area during
2005 -07 in real terms (excluding the temporary peak during 2008). Further details on
the assumptions used for crop budgets can be found in table 1 (Annex), Tables 2a ­ 2g
include the detailed crop budgets.


Evolution of Cropping Patterns

    The without project scenario (ex post) shows the following trends:

    ·   increase of the wet season cultivated area in 2004; and
    ·   decline of the irrigated area during wet and dry season at a rate of 10 percent p.a.

        The with project scenario uses baseline data for cultivated area and crop budgets 1
- 3 for the first 3 years (2001 ­ 04) given that project activities only commenced in 2004
at field level. The period 2004 ­ 07 shows an increase in area planted with improved



                                               35

agricultural technologies and water management reflected in an expansion of area under
crop budgets 4 and 5 and substitution of area under crop budgets 1 and 2. At the end of
the project implementation period, half of the farmers are using improved seeds during
the wet season. This percentage is expected to continue during the rest of the analysis
period since a further increase of the area with improved seeds during wet season is likely
to cause labor shortages during peak periods (mainly transplanting and harvesting). The
use of traditional varieties on some of the area attenuates labor peaks. A reduction of the
area under improved seeds seems unlikely in view of the substantial benefits achieved by
farmers and the training of a number of farmers in seed multiplication under the project.
The effects of improved water management are reflected the yields assumptions in CBs 4
and 5.

        During the dry season, project benefits result from the incremental area under
irrigation and from yield increases (shift from CB 3 to CBs 6 and 7).             Based on
information collected during fieldwork, it is further assumed that half of the farmers use
the full technology package (CB 7), whereas the other 50 percent apply half of the
recommended amount of fertilizer (CB 6). From 2008 until 2021, an annual decline of 5
percent of the dry season irrigated area is projected, due to insufficient repair and
maintenance. This rate is assumed to be somewhat lower than in the without project
scenario (10 percent) reflecting some benefits of rehabilitation and training of WUGs
during the project, under an optimistic base case scenario.

Project Costs

        Annex 1 shows project costs at appraisal and completion. Overall, costs were 14
percent above appraisal estimates and the most important cost overruns accrued for
consultants (156 percent), civil works (136 percent), and incremental operating costs (130
percent). These cost overruns are mainly attributable to the delays in the implementation
and completion of civil works and to increasing fuel prices. Tables 7 and 8 in the
accompanying Excel file show that the bulk of the expenditure occurred between 2005
and 2007.

        Estimating the amount of water fees paid by farmers is challenging since most
irrigation systems have only been functioning for one or two years after rehabilitation and
no uniform approach has been applied in establishing irrigation service fees.
Nevertheless, many WUAs have adopted the official government regulation for gravity
schemes, which establishes irrigation service fees in kind (paddy), rather than in
monetary terms. These fees are expressed in kind, amount to 200kg paddy for gravity
and 150kg for pump schemes, and should cover operation and maintenance costs. In
addition, in pump schemes electricity costs of Kip 300,000 per ha are to be paid. In
addition, 1 percent of the investment costs are budgeted for repair works every five years,
to be met by the Provincial Governments.

        No systematic data exists about collection rates of irrigation service fees so far.
Fieldwork and a study on water users associations conducted by an international
consultant in March 2007 suggest that fee collection only started in the dry season
2006/07. A recent review of the irrigation sub-sector finds significant electricity debts of
water users associations with pump irrigation. No consistent information about wet



                                             36

season irrigation and related fees has been available; hence, no quantification could be
made. For the analysis, a collection rate of 70 percent has been assumed.

        For the analysis, an average irrigation fee amounts to Kip 257,000 per ha (USD
29.8) has been computed for the dry season, based on average costs for gravity and pump
irrigation adjusted by their respective shares in total dry season irrigated area and by a
collection rate of 70 percent. This amount is slightly above 2 percent of the average
investment costs per ha (view Table 4). However, the only a part of the collected amount
is used for O&M: According to the regulations, 20 percent should be transferred to the
district as contributions for funding repair works, whereas the remaining 80 percent
enters the Village Development Fund. Only a fraction of this amount is designated for
irrigation O&M and the rest spent for other village development activities. Although no
reliable data is available on the use of collected irrigation service fees in the 19 irrigation
schemes, evidence suggests that the amounts used for O&M are insufficient to ensure the
proper operation and maintenance of the rehabilitated area over the period of analysis
(until 2021).

Conversion from Financial into Economic Prices

        In the crop budgets in financial prices, only hired labor was costed (mainly for
transplanting and harvesting) in order to calculate the returns to land, labor and capital.
For the conversion into economic prices, family labor was costed according to its
opportunity costs. During peak periods (transplanting and harvest), rural labor is fully
employed and wage rates equal opportunity costs. During other stages of the crop cycle,
labor is costed at 50 percent of the rural wage rate reflecting rural underemployment.

        The Lao economy is open and no major distortions in commodity and foreign
exchange markets could be found. A 5 percent import tax applies to fertilizer and the
economic price has been adjusted accordingly although a significant share of fertilizer
used in the project area is imported informally along the river. Despite the existence of
quantitative export restriction for rice, the commodity is widely exported informally
along the river. Glutinous rice is specialty rice consumed mainly in Laos and Northern
Thailand and occasionally in Vietnam and China. Prices are only indirectly correlated
with world market prices for ordinary rice. Glutinous rice is mainly exported to Thailand
where significant demand exists, and to Vietnam and China.              Most exports occur
informally and were estimated at about at 300,000 tons during 2007 by the Agro
Processors Association, compared to only 3,670 tons reported in official statistics from
the Ministry of Trade and Industry.

        Most goods procured by the project through national or international competitive
bidding and international shopping do not accrue taxes or other duties. Civil works costs
have not been broken down into major cost items in the cost tables received from the
PCO. Based on interviews held during the mission and in line with the Borrowers´ PCR,
overall civil works costs were divided into 30 percent for labor and 70 percent for
material, mostly imported. Labor costs were adjusted by a shadow wage rate of 0.8 to
reflect the prevailing under-employment in Laos.

          Total costs for rehabilitation of irrigation systems and access roads amount to
USD 10.3 million (financial) and USD 9.7 million (economic). Divided by a total
command area of 7,400 ha, costs per hectare amount to USD 1,394 (financial) and USD
1,314 (economic) which are within a reasonable range in South East Asia. If total project
cost excluding the VIP component are used, unit costs per increased to USD 2,513

* Include Samong 1, for which more than half of the rehabilitation costs were financed by the project


          For the base case scenario, the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) was
recalculated a) for the entire project costs, and b) for the project costs excluding the VIP
component. Based on the total project costs, the EIRR amounts to 18.9 percent and
increases to 23.2 percent if VIP related costs are excluded. The Net Present Value (NPV)
amounts to USD 3,389,262 and USD 4,667,962, respectively, at a discount rate of 12
percent. This compares favorably with PAD estimates of an EIRR of 16.3 percent and an
NPV of USD 2.3 million. The increase is consistent with the slight overachievement of
key output targets (Table 1).

          Three alternative scenarios have also been modeled to assess the impact of
changes in key parameters on EIRR and NPV. The first two scenarios explore the impact
of changes in paddy prices on the EIRR. An increase of the paddy price 15 percent would
drive the EIRR up to 26.0 (31.8 percent) whereas a decline by 15 percent would reduce it
to 11.8 percent (14.8 percent). In the latter case, the NPV would turn negative at a
discount rate of 12 percent. This shows that the EIRR is highly sensitive to changes in
paddy prices.

 decreases by 15% p.a.)


          Scenario 3 shows the effects of a decline of the irrigated area by 15 percent per
year due to insufficient funding for maintenance and repair works and / or poor quality of
the works. Such scenario might not be unlikely in view of the insufficient funding used
for preventive maintenance, the limited "on the job training" which could be provided to
WUGs after the completion of the rehabilitation works and before the closure of the



                                                                    38

project. It would resemble the situation observed in most irrigation schemes in Laos
following construction or rehabilitation. The relatively modest decline of the EIRR to
15.4 percent (19.9 percent) is partly attributable to the method of calculation which
applies the same rate of decline to the without project situation where it results in a sharp
reduction in dry season irrigation starting in year 1. The reduction of the EIRR would be
more substantial if the scenario was applied to the total instead of the incremental net
benefits of the project. This highlights the importance of providing ongoing support to
Water User Groups to enhance their capacity to ensure system maintenance and of
adequate budget allocations at provincial level for repair works and operational costs of
extension staff.

  ANNEX 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICRR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICRR


Project Achievements

        The Project Appraisal Document included 21 irrigation schemes covering 7,070
ha as the schemes for rehabilitation under the Project. Of these schemes, 18 were
implemented (including two changes, Naphok replacing Naxaithong in Attapeu Province
and Mouangkao replacing Thathot in Khammouane Province) and 3 were dropped. Due
to some changes in command area the final command area of the 18 schemes amounted
to 7,250 ha.

        Village access tracks were planned to provide the critical links between villages
and existing main or gravel roads and between villages and irrigation systems. These
tracks were to enable easier provision of inputs to the agricultural systems and easier
market access to agricultural produce. Although 165 km of access tracks were originally
planned, eventually only 104.3 km were built under the project.

        The water supply and sanitation component was based on a demand-driven
approach combined with a limited range of options, with a focus on providing water
supply through deep and shallow wells and the provision of some 5,000 sanitary pit
latrines. A total of 200 deep wells, 46 shallow wells, 5,636 family latrines and 44 school
latrines were constructed under the Project.

        Office renovations and construction of training centres were also carried out
under the Project's civil works program. Renovations of the PCO and the four PPIO
offices was undertaken, along with small scale renovation works for 15 District offices.
Four Agricultural Training Centres were completed under the Project.

        Under the environmental component, seven specific environmental management
plans were prepared for schemes that had been flagged during project appraisal. In
addition, general environmental management plans were incorporated in the construction
contracts to ensure safeguarding of people and the environment during construction
activities. Environmental technical guidelines were also developed under the Project and
incorporated in the later civil works contracts.

        The Credit Agreement for ADP required the Project to prepare resettlement plans,
wherever two hundred or more villagers were adversely affected by a subproject, in
accordance with the World Bank's Policy Framework for Compensation, Resettlement
and Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons. Resettlement Plans were prepared for all
schemes, approved by the World Bank, and implemented with appropriate
documentation. In some cases, due to construction delays or the need for renovation
works to damaged sections, supplementary plans were required.

        Training and study tour program were the main activities under the Agriculture
extension component mainly to support the introduction of LEA, Agriculture
demonstration and on-farm research activities. A total of 319 Agriculture trainings, 934
training days, 21,511 trainees including 4,894 women trainees were conducted from



                                             46

2003-2008. The training mainly focused on rice production technologies, dry season
cash crop production, agriculture extension system, livestock production and veterinary,
soil improvement and village development fund operation.

        On-farm research and demonstration activities were identified and selected based
on the PRA (need assessment) results. The technologies were recommended by the
previous projects, NAFRI, NAFRI, NAFES, IRRI, CIAT and the technical department of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The main technologies demonstrated were: (a)
rice production; (b) farmer level rice seed production; (c) integrated pest management;
(d) cash crop production; (e) soil improvement; (f) animal feed production; (g) fruit tree;
(h) livestock; (i) fisheries; and (j) village development fund.

        Water user groups in all irrigation schemes have been re-organized and
strengthened. To the end of March 2008, 272 Farmer Irrigation Groups have been
formed and strengthened. Total WUG members are 6,347 families. There are 635
temporary WUG members (not included above) who cultivate the land mainly for the dry
season rice production by signing tenant contracts with the land owners.

        The Village Investment for the Poor component was carried out in three phases,
the first two phases (March 2002 to February 2004 and February 2004 to February 2005)
were funded from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) and the third phase from
March 2005 to June 2007 (some activities extended to June 2008) was funded out of the
IDA Credit. Expenditure under the JSDF totalled US$ 1,142,015.72. Expenditure under
the IDA Credit reached US$ 325,918 (for sub-grants only). Activities were carried out in
204 villages in the 15 Project districts with a total number of 540 activities. The main
aim of the component was to assist the poor, ethnic minorities and women.

        The PCO fulfilled the coordinating role, consolidating plans and budgets and
reimbursement claims for all the Project offices. Most procurement was coordinated
from the PCO, with preparation of bidding documents carried out centrally, although the
relevant bid evaluations for construction works were carried out by the PPIOs. Bid
evaluations were submitted to the PCO for review, before being submitted to the World
Bank for approval. The PCO also carried out all procurement of consultants, both for the
main TA Team and individuals for other support services such as VIP, finance and M&E.
All reporting was managed from the PCO, with TA assistance, and auditors were also
recruited by the PCO.

Implementation

        The Development Credit Agreement (3509 LA) for the Agricultural Development
Project between the Lao People's Democratic Republic and the International
Development Association was signed on 2 July 2001 and became effective on 26 October
2001, with a closure date of 30 June 2007.

        The Credit Agreement required the appointment of a Procurement Specialist as a
condition of loan effectiveness. This was to assist the project with the initial procurement
activities, particularly of the Project Consultants, local consultants for survey and design
and vehicles and equipment.            This was effected, although the recruitment and

appointment of the Project Consultants was delayed and the Consultants were not fielded
until May 2003.

        Preparation of irrigation and access track designs by locally recruited consultants
also fell behind schedule. The Project Consultants carried out extensive design reviews,
requested changes, and eventually the revised designs were accepted and construction
commenced in dry season 2004/2005, two years behind the schedule in the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD). Delays in construction were also caused by the need for the
preparation, approval and implementation of the Resettlement Plans. Preparation of
Resettlement Plans took a great deal of time and these had to be completed, approved and
implemented prior to commencement of construction.

        The combination of delays eventually led to the agreement for a one-year
extension in the Credit Agreement, with loan closure extended from 30 June 2007 to 30
June 2008.

        Project costs at the time of appraisal amounted to US$ 18.21 million, of which
US$ 16.69 million was to be met by the IDA Project Loan (equivalent to SDR 13.20
million at SDR 1 = US$ 1.264 on 1 May 2001). Although there have been several agreed
reallocations of the loan proceeds, there has been no change in the total credit amount in
terms of SDR. However, due to the significant fluctuations in exchange rates, and the
World Bank's decision in July 2005 to meet 100 percentaje of the Project's costs out of
the loan, expenditure in dollar terms increased to reach US$ 19.10 million.

        At Project Appraisal, it was assumed that the Project period would be 5 years
from late 2001 to the end of 2006, however the loan became effective on 26 October
2001, with a closure date of 30 June 2007. Peak years of expenditure were expected to
be 2004, 2005 and 2006, but delays in the recruitment of the Project Consultants (not
fielded until May 2003) led to delays in implementation activities and by mid-term
review (delayed one year) in April/May 2005, it was clear that the Project was running
behind schedule and that a further year may be needed to complete the works. The IDA
eventually agreed to an extension of 12 months to enable completion of ongoing
subprojects as well as utilization of the remaining funds.

Problems Encountered

        There were a number of problems with the irrigation system and access track
designs, including a limited amount of local consultation with the district/provincial
authorities or with farmer beneficiaries, and non-compliance with the technical
conditions of the TOR. Discussions were held with the two consulting firms and by late
2003 most of the design problems had been rectified and the work resubmitted.

        The preparation of the Resettlement Plans proved to be much more onerous and
time consuming than expected and led to delays in the tendering process, due to the
requirement of approval and implementation of the resettlement plans prior to
commencement of construction.

        During the 2005 wet season, excessive rainfall caused damage to several schemes
that were under construction, resulting in a World Bank request to review all the designs
to try to ensure that further damage would not be caused by design faults, and to prepare
remedial designs for those schemes that had suffered damage. However, it was not until
the start of the 2007 wet season that most of the remedial works were completed.

        One contractor that had been awarded contracts for Samong I and II in Attapeu
and Nondeng I and II in Saravane was unable to perform up to expectations and the
Project had to cancel all three contracts. This resulted in delays to these schemes and
contracts were remodelled and rebid. Unfortunately, there was evidence of collusion
amongst the bidders for Samong I and Samong II rebids, and the World Bank cancelled
funding for these contracts and the Government of Lao also cancelled the contracts and
blacklisted the concerned contractors for 3 years.

        There was confusion in the setting up of VDFs for the irrigation villages. These
were intended to provide financial support for agricultural inputs such as fertilizer. They
were not meant to have the same function and modality of the VDFs set up for VIP
activities, which had a much lower funding requirement.

        Training activities did not reach their intended targets, partly due to funding
difficulties, funds not available or not at the right time, and partly due to an overly
ambitious training program. Some 50 percent of the planned trainings were carried out.

        The Village Investment for the Poor (VIP) was a new approach for many of the
staff involved. The main social sciences tool used was the Participatory Rapid Appraisal
(PRA) and this was introduced to the Provincial and District staff engaged on the VIP
component. While the aim was to start from a bottom-up approach to planning VIP
activities, in practice, a top-down list of possible activities was also presented to the
villagers and this often formed the basis for the resulting projects. To some extent this
was logical, in that there were particular skills and projects that naturally fell under this
type of small-scale activity. The main challenge that faced the program was not technical
nor social, but financial management. The process of approval of a project and agreeing
to funding was cumbersome involving too many signatures for such small amounts.

        The main issue arising from the implementation arrangements was the lack of
control that the PCO had over the PPIOs. In fact, the PCO could only "coordinate" and
not control. Similarly, reporting and data collection was continuously difficult. This
applied to regular reporting as well as financial reporting and reimbursement claims.

        The problems with financial management arose at the start of the Project, when
ADP was handed over to NAFES to implement, and prior financial training of staff
expected to be working on ADP was lost, as the staff were not transferred to ADP. Staff
that were appointed did not have the training or capacity to manage the finances
adequately. This also led to lack of proper supervision and assistance to the provincial
level financial staff.

Project Benefits

        Project benefits appear to be significant. The field surveys have shown increases
in paddy rice crop yields throughout the Project area. Dry season crop yields are reported
to range from 4.10 t/ha in Attapeu, 4.92 t/ha in Champasak, 5.32 t/h in Khammouane and
5.12 t/ha in Saravane, average of all schemes in each province is 4.8 t/ha. This compares
with the PAD reported yield of 3.8 t/ha for irrigated dry season HYV rice in the present
or pre-project situation, and a predicted yield of 4.4 t/ha.

        Cropping intensity at appraisal was reported to be only 109 percent. It was
anticipated that cropping intensity with the project should increase to 162 percent In fact,
during the 2007 dry season, the first year that all works were completed and all schemes
functioning, Project cropping intensity reached 181 percent.

        With the increase in yields and cropped area, production increases were
substantial during 2007. The PAD indicated that pre-project production of rice was only
12,071 tons, with a predicted production with project of 31,535 tons. Reported total
production for the 2007 year (wet and dry seasons) was 53,989 tons, or an incremental
increase of 41,918 tons, or over 440 percent.

        An economic analysis carried out in June 2008 showed that the irrigation schemes
were very beneficial, with an overall EIRR of 26 percentage in the base case of a
conservative yield of 4.0 t/ha and a paddy rice price of Kip 2,200/kg, considering direct
civil works costs alone and incremental dry season crop production. If all costs are
considered in this situation, the EIRR drops to 7 percent However, the crop yield of
4.0 t/ha used is conservative, the benefits of increased yield in the whole project area in
the wet season through improved cropping practices and greater use of HYVs and the
incremental yield increase in the pre-project dry season irrigated area have been ignored.
If the FOB Thailand price is used, the EIRR increases dramatically to 54 percent even
with all Project costs considered.

        A separate analysis utilizing field data reports indicates an EIRR of 34 percentage
if only irrigation costs are considered and 14 percent if all Project costs are considered. It
is suspected that these yields may be a little higher than reality, and that the base case
above is more realistic.

        Additional benefits that have not been quantified include the benefits from the
VIP component, water supply and sanitation and livestock and vegetables. All these
activities have provided benefits particularly to the poor, ethnic minorities and women.
