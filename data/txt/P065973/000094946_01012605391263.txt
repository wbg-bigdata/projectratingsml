LAO PDR: AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Development Strategy for Ethnic Minority and Vulnerable Groups
Draft
January 11, 2001
Introduction
1.    The Development Strategy for Ethnic Minority and Vulnerable Groups lays out
the development strategy and program for the involvement of these groups in the
Agricultural Development Project (the Project).
2.    The Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is one of the poorest and least
developed countries in East Asia. Rural poverty, found primarily among households who
live at the subsistence level is a major concern. At the same time, agriculture remains the
major sector of the economy. Against this background, and based on discussions with the
Government, the proposed Project will be designed as the first phase of a program of
investments and institutional capacity building needed to support agricultural growth, and
thereby reduce rural poverty. A strong emphasis on community involvement and
participation will be an integral feature of the proposed project.
3.    Four provinces - Khammouane, Champasak, Saravane and Attapeu, all located in
the southern half of the country - have been proposed by the Government, based on
several criteria, for the project. Poverty is widespread in all four provinces; its incidence
is particularly high in the latter two. Attapeu, to the extreme south, is difficult to reach,
and is isolated due to the lack of good roads.
4.    The magnitude of adverse impact from the Project is anticipated to be marginal as
the physical infrastructure will focus on rehabilitation of irrigation systems and access
tracks and the construction of hand pumps and open wells. However, it is possible that
during the course of implementation some land may need to be acquired and some
compensation may need to be paid to project affected persons. To adequately address the
rehabilitation and compensation of the people who could possibly to be adversely
affected by the acquisition of land under the Project, the Government of the Lao PDR and
LADP has prepared a Policy Framework for Land Acquisition, Involuntary Resettlement
and Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons.
5.    The greater impact from the Project is expected to be positive. The Project will
have significant benefits for the ethnic minority and other poor vulnerable groups in the
four provinces. The strategy as laid out in the next few pages will provide the
development strategy and proposed direction for participation of the ethnic minorities and
vulnerable groups in the Project.

Background Information'
Ethnic Groups
6.     The ethnic composition of the country is made up of primarily ethnic minority
groups who total about 70% of a population of less than 5 million people. It is generally
agreed that the four major ethno linguistic families are: Tai-Kadai (62.2%); Austroasiatic
(23%), Miao-Yao or Hmong-Mien (7.4%) and Sino-Tibetan (2.7%). The ethnic Lao who
hold the dominant position in the country make up about 30% of the population and are
linguistically part of the Tai-Kadai stock. The percentage of ethnic minorities in the four
project provinces of Khammouane, Champasak, Saravane and Attapeu is indicated in the
table below. The two main ethno linguistic families represented in the area are Tai-Kadai
and Austroasiatic.

Total          1,213.1         69.2          30.8
7.     The proposed Project will be in 15 districts, out of a total of 32 districts in all four
provinces, which have been selected based on the presence of existing irrigation schemes
with potential for rehabilitation and increased coverage in the dry season. In general,
these districts are in the lower altitude as irrigation schemes are primarily found in the
lowland. The majority of the population in these districts are from the Lao ethnic group.
The irrigation and agricultural extension components which comprise, therefore, will
largely benefit the lowland Lao ethnic group. The Project will also have a component,
the Village Investment for the Poor (VIP), which will address demand driven proposals
from the poorest villages in the districts. The VIP and part of the agricultural extension
component will have more relevance for ethnic minority groups who are normally the
poorest and more isolated of the groups.

Legal Framework
8.    The policy regarding ethnic minorities since the current regime came into power
in 1975 is found in primarily two documents: the Constitution of 1991 and the Resolution
of the Party Central Organization of 1992.
The Constitution of 1991
Article 8 of the Constitution reads:
The State pursues the policy ofpromoting unity and equality among all ethnic
groups. All ethnic groups have the rights to protect, preserve and promote the
fine customs and cultures of their own tribes and of the nation. All acts of
creating division and discrimination among between ethnic groups are forbidden.
7he State implements every measure to gradually develop and upgrade the
economic and social level of all ethnic groups.
The constitution defines the Lao PDR as multi-ethnic state, as well as
guaranteeing a number of fundamental rights, including the right to work (Article 26),
and the freedom of assembly and association (Article 31).
The 1992 Resolution of the Party Central Organization
In 1992 the policy entitled, Resolution of the Party Central Organization
Concerning Ethnic Minority Affairs in the New Era was signed by the President. This is
the cornerstone of current national ethnic minority policy.
The general policy of the Party concerning ethnic minorities can be summarized
as follows:
a. Build national sentiment (national identity).
b. Realize equality between ethnic minorities.
3



c. Increase the level of solidarity among ethnic minorities as members of the
greater Lao family.
d. Resolve problems of inflexible and vengeful thinking, as well as economic
and cultural inequality.
e. Improve the living conditions of the ethnic minorities step by step.
f. Expand, to the greatest extent possible, the good and beautiful heritage and
ethnic identity of each group as well as their capacity to participate in the
affairs of the nation.
9.    Further review on the ethnic minority policy will be undertaken by the Ministry of
Justice as one of the 38 laws to be elaborated during the five year period 2001 to 2005.
These laws are as follows:
1) Law on State Property; 2) Culture Law; 3) Construction Law; 4) Post Law; 5)
Telecommunication Law; 6) Bank Note Law; 7) Food Law; 8) Special Economic
Zone Law; 9) Sanitation, Prevention and Health Promotion Law; 10) Consumer
Protection Law; 11) Intellectual Property Law; 12) Judiciary Police Law; 13)
Detention Center Law; 14) Narcotics Law; 15) Civil Aviation Law; 16) Handicraft
Law; 17) Aquatic and Wild Life Law; 18) Arbitration Law; 19) Legal Counseling
Law; 20) Water Traffic Law; 21) Civil Service Law; 22) Women and Children Law;
23) Youth Law; 24) Trade Union Law; 25) Ethnic Group Law; 26) Religion Law;
27) Law on Assistance to the Population; 28) Professional Association Law; 29) Mass
Media Law; 30) National Heritage Law; 31) Chief-Town Law; 32) Industrial Zone
Law; 33) Veterans Law; 34) Cooperative Law; 35) Cottage Industry Law; 36) State
Economy Law; 37) Trade Law; 38) Medical Treatment Law.
Social and Economic Situation
10.   The four project provinces have about 70% Lao population and 30% of ethnic
minority population, the majority of whom live in upland areas. As mentioned above, the
districts selected for the project will be mainly in lowland areas due to its focus on
irrigation. They number 15 out of a total of 32 districts in the four provinces. Table 3
below provides an indication of the numerous ethnic minority groups in the 32 districts.
A few groups have significantly large populations and are scattered in different provinces
while there are some groups that have only a small cluster of households in one or two
locations.

population and above.
11.   The Social and Economic Assessment undertaken at the beginning of project
preparation found that the issues concerning the ethnic minority groups were those
related to the problems of health, education, food security and the limited access to public
services and infrastructure. In the area of health, diseases such as malaria, diarrhoea and
respiratory infections were the main causes of death of children and adults. In addition,
their ignorance on family planning methods have worsened women's well being and
health risks due to frequent pregnancies and child births. High rates of infant mortality
were relatively common.
12.   Education in terms of ability to read and write was also relatively low among the
ethnic minorities particularly the women. Compared to the Lao and Phutai groups, the
literacy rate of women in most of the other ethnic groups were well under 35% (see Table
4). The lack of exposure further exacerbated their situation As a consequence, many
development projects which require basic numerical literacy and reading/writing skills
could not be successfully or be fully participated in by the women beneficiaries. In many
cases they were taken over by men.

13.   Food security is a widespread phenomenon to various extent among poor
communities in most of the ethnic minority groups. The groups who suffered most are
those dependent solely on upland rice which produces relatively low yields. The average
period with rice supplies per family lasted for about 3-4 months in a year. To cope with
the situation, most upland farmers have to supplement their rice intake by mixing it with
starchy roots or tubers and corn.
14.   Limited or complete lack of access to public utilities, infrastructure and services
such as all-season roads, clean potable water and health services is one of the
fundamental constraints which perpetuated their being caught in the vicious circle. Some
of this lack of access to services and infrastructure is ironically due to the Government's
policy of relocation and consolidation of villages in order to reduce shifting cultivation
and to bring services to the minority groups. While the Government has tried to provide
as much services as they could, lack of resources has limited its ability to do more and
many of these "new" villages have been left to take care of themselves.
Community Social and Economic Assessment
15.    Due to the approach where eligible villages for the VIP program will only be self
selected during implementation, the Project will require community assessments from
each village as part of the condition for participation. Assistance will be provided by the
6



Project to conduct the community assessment which will be simple and participatory.
The information from the assessment will be the basis for the villagers to prioritize their
sub-projects and for the Project to ensure that they are culturally and socially compatible
with the needs and priorities of the ethnic minority groups.
Development Strategy for Ethnic Minority and Vulnerable Groups Development
Development Principles
16.   The principles in the development strategy for the ethnic minority and vulnerable
groups in the Project are based on the policies of the Government of Lao PDR and the
World Bank. These principles are:
a. To promote unity and equality among all ethnic groups;
b. To improve the living conditions of the ethnic minorities;
c. To identify any potentially adverse impacts and determine mechanisms to
avoid, or minimize and mitigate them; and
d. To ensure that intended benefits are culturally compatible with, and tailored
to, the needs and priorities of ethnic minority and vulnerable groups.2
Development Opportunities
17.   Improved Small Scale Infrastructure and Agricultural Extension. Findings from
the social and economic assessment show that ethnic minority households who live in
areas with relatively flat land and therefore with potential for agricultural want "increased
income from rice". This would mean improvements in irrigation. Equally important is
their request for agricultural know-how and extension services. Women from these
households have also requested for improvements in domestic water supply and
vegetable gardens. The Project will ensure that, in areas with ethnic minority
communities, the local and district staff working on these components will have ethnic
minority staff and/or representation from ethnic minority representatives to help in the
implementation.
18.   Village Investment for the Poor. The Project will provide development
opportunities for the ethnic minority and other vulnerable groups primarily through the
component known as Village Investment for the Poor (VIP). The proposed VIP will be a
block grant to a district for implementing small scale projects identified by the villagers
themselves. The eligibility and selection criteria shall ensure that sub-projects are
demand-driven and meet community preferences, and that they meet essential technical,
economic, financial and social parameters which will be developed during project
2 The Project will not provide assistance to focal sites program and to areas planned for future focal sites
where ethnic mninority groups will be relocated.
7



preparation and set out in an Implementation Manual. Simple criteria will be developed
to establish cost, benefits and technical feasibility. The majority of the sub-projects are
expected to be small and well within the technical and management capacity of the
community. This component will be closely linked and integrated with the agricultural
extension component of the Project.
19.   Eligibility Criteria. VIP will set up eligibility criteria for beneficiary groups
which will include the characteristics listed below. A logical unit for submission of
proposals is the sub-village unit or nouai which is composed of 10 to 15 households. An
eligible nouai should have the following minimum criteria:
* come from the list of sub-village units classified as "poor" by the village and
district;
* proposals coming from women and ethnic minority groups will be weighted
favorably;
* the beneficiary households are willing to contribute a minimum of 10 percent of
sub-project costs (which can also be in the form of labor); and
* the nouai should commit to be responsible for operation and maintenance if the
proposal is for a small scale infrastructure sub-project.
20.   A VIP implementation manual is currently being developed and will contain all
the necessary information. It will also include simple formats for project proposal,
budget, appraisal, community procurement, expenses records, monitoring, and reporting.
21.   Women. While eligibility is based on poverty for villages, preference within the
eligible villages will also be given to women in that for every two proposals approved for
a village, the second must come from a women's group. One of several lessons learned
from previous Bank projects is that few women will participate in projects unless special
arrangements are made for them. In Lao PDR, ethnic minority women are the most
disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. The VIP program will try to address some of their
issues by focusing on key needs and priorities for women including livelihood and
literacy activities.
Implementation Plan
Information Dissemination
22.   A strong information dissemination program will be established for the Project to
provide project information as well as to promote transparency in available resources and
costs of various sub-projects in the VIP program. The media used will be a combination
of modem and traditional sources depending on the access to such sources and the
literacy level of the communities. In addition to text and speech, alternative medium
such as pictures, visual aids, video and other appropriate methods will be used. The
Project will made every effort to take the information to eligible villages which are
8



remote and where existing information dissemination media are not available. The
efforts will include information provided in local languages and by ethnic minority staff
as well as during a time and space convenient to the villagers.
Community Assessment and Development Plans
23.   Community social and economic assessment and preparation of development
plans is one concrete way to begin encouraging the participation of ethnic minorities and
other vulnerable groups in their own development as well as to take account of the social
and economic diversity of the area. This community approach will: a) involve the
villagers in undertaking their own surveys and needs assessments; b) use the findings to
develop village plans which will provide inputs for district plans; c) help to prioritize sub-
projects; d) develop community indicators for development which they can self monitor;
and e) develop ownership for their own development.
24.   Involving community groups in prioritizing and developing their own sub-
projects is one way for the Project to ensure that the activities are culturally and socially
appropriate for the respective groups. It will also begin to promote decentralization down
to the village level. Assistance will be provided by the Project to conduct the community
assessment and in community development. It will work with local and regional experts
in collaboration with the district staff and Lao Women's Union in providing this
assistance.
Technical Assistance
25.   Simple guidelines including simplified participatory methods and tools will be
developed for the above purposes. Guidance and training from the Project will be
provided to ethnic minority communities so that they can prepare and implement
effective demand-driven sub-projects. Local and regional community development
specialists will be hired to help implement the program and to provide capacity building
assistance to the district government staff and the villagers. There are several qualified
people in the country who have worked in upland areas and are familiar with the
cultivation practices and the issues of ethnic minority groups. Their expertise will also be
tapped for this program.
Linkage to Government Programs and Institutional Arrangements
26.   The VIP will be under the coordination of the Provincial Agriculture and Forestry
Services Organization and will be implemented by the District Agriculture and Forestry
Organization (DAFO) extension unit, i.e. by the group of staff at the DAFO level who
will be trained under the project. One staff will be assigned from DAFO to be
responsible for the component. At the village level, a village volunteer will be recruited
to be the facilitator at that level. The village volunteer will be assist DAFO with the
following tasks: information dissemination about the program; conduct of simple village
assessments and prioritization of needs; assisting the nouai to prepare proposals and
plans; facilitate the linkages with DAFO; collect pre and post baseline data; supervise
9



sub-project implementation; and undertake follow-up on operation and maintenance by
the beneficiary groups. Initially, the DAFO staff will undertake these activities until such
time that they can transfer them gradually to the village volunteer.
27.   Participation at the village and district levels will be enhanced through the
inclusion of the existing village and district development committee for their role in
reviewing and appraising the sub-projects. DAFO staff will provide the technical
assistance in reviewing sub-projects for technical feasibility, if required, and for
providing extension services, when needed.
28.   The VIP will have a simple monitoring system which will include village self
monitoring of its own sub-projects. In addition, it will be linked to the overall Project's
monitoring and evaluation program.
Implementation Schedule
29.   The VIP program will follow a gradual pace (see diagram below). Only one
district per province will start in year one of project implementation and will increase by
one every year (except for Champasak which will increase by two because of its stronger
district staff). Year one will be used for testing implementation of VIP, to improve on the
implementation manual and to modify its TA requirement if necessary.

Financing
30.   A proposed cost estimate has been included in the overall project cost for the VIP
program. It amounts to about $2 million or 12% of the total project cost of $17 million.
The funds will be divided as follows: 70% for sub-project investments; 10% for
10



community training; and 20% for technical assistance, information dissemination
program and incremental staff costs at the provincial and district levels. Details for
proposed annual costing are found in the cost tables for the Project.
Conflict Resolution
31.   Complaints and grievances from the villagers related to any aspect of the VIP
program and the other Project components will be reported to the sub-village head who
brings them to the attention of the Village Development Committee for action. The
Committee should respond within 15 days after the complaint is launched. If the villager
is not satisfied with the decision of the Village Development Committee, he or she can
ask the Committee to present the case to the District Development Committee who also
has 15 days to respond. If neither the Village nor District Development Committees is
able to render satisfactory resolution, the next level will be an appeal to the representative
of the National Assembly at the provincial level. This representative acts like an
ombudsperson and can initiate results quickly.
Monitoring and Evaluation
32.   A monitoring system will be developed which will tie in with the overall
monitoring program of LADP. The monitoring will be at two levels: a) one at the
program level which will be implemented by the district; and b) the other at the village
level which will be a participatory self monitoring by beneficiary groups. The VIP
monitoring will be developed with the help of an expert who is knowledgeable with
M&E in societies with low literacy where alternatives to the text and national language
will be included. The Project will commission two evaluations-one at mid-term and
one at the end of this Project phase-which will include a section on the effectiveness of
the ethnic minority development strategy. Feedback from the regular monitoring and
mid-term evaluation will be used to improve the program.
