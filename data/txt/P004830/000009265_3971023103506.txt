VIETNAM
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. Population and Development
1.1         Vietnam is the second most populous country in Southeast Asia with a
1995 population of 74 million projected to reach 80 million by 2000. About 15
million (20%) of the population is urban. Four major cities Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi,
Danang and Haiphong account for 37% of the urban population with the remainder
living in about 500 locations. About 80% of the urban population is concentrated in
77 cities with population over 15,000.
1.2         Literacy (over 90t for adult males and females) and life expectancy (68
years) are above the less developed country (LDC) averages while access to safe
water supply (50% urban, 25% rural) is below the LDC average. Lack of safe water and
adequate sanitation facilities are the major causes of Vietnam's higher incidence
of water-borne and hygiene-related diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery,
typhoid, cholera and hepatitis which also contribute to childhood morbidity and
mortality. The ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality are practically all due
to communicable diseases, most of them preventable.
1.3         Economic growth has accelerated with the introduction of reforms in
1986. Since then it has averaged around 7-8 percent per annum leading to increased
urbanization (estimated to grow by 70% in next ten years) and rising urban incomes.
Foreign investment has been attracted to Vietnam but limited by infrastructure
constraints in urban areas. Infrastructure in most cities and towns, laid at the end
of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, has not been adequately maintained
or upgraded because of resource constraints.
1.4         The Government has responded to the above by adopting in 1991 the Socio-
Economic Stabilization and Development Strategy to the Year 2000. The aspects of the
strategy relevant to the proposed project are to:
(i)   focus limited resources available to develop infrastructure to promote
investment in services and industries in three priority areas: (a) Hanoi-Haiphong-
Quang Ninh; (b) Ho Chi Minh City-Bien Hoa-Vung Tau; and (c) the Danang area;
(ii) streamline the number of line ministries, focus policy-making within the
central government and decentralize implementation to local governments; and
(iii) improve the management mechanism of state enterprises, experiment and
gradually expand the transformation of state enterprises into private companies.
B. Water Supply and Sanitation
1.5         Water supply and sanitation infrastructure has been affected by extreme
resource constraints in the past, by lack of access to quality materials due to
isolation of the Vietnamese economy, by the socio-political necessity for state
enterprises to spread resources thinly in providing basic services free or for
minimum fee to as many as possible, and by the acceptance of minimal service
standards by consumers during times of national adversity. Given the conditions, the
performance of the Water Supply Companies (WSCs) has been quite remarkable.



2
1.6         Piped water is available to about 50% of the urban population with
access ranging between 60%-80% in large cities and under 30% in other towns.
However, material quality, cumulative deferred maintenance over decades, and
inadequate expansion have taken their toll. Pumping and treatment facilities are
overloaded and inefficient with ageing and non-compatible equipment leading to unit
power consumption double international averages while distribution systems leak
excessively. As a result, service is intermittent with low pressure, per capita
water availability is low (below 120 liters per capita per day - lcd) and 80% of the
water supplied does not meet national water quality standards. In addition, WSCs
have been oriented towards using subsidies to meet social targets with minimal
incentive to recover costs from user charges. Therefore, billing and collection
functions have been neglected. Physical water loss and inadequate billing and
collection have combined to yield non-revenue water (NRW)1 of over 50% in some WSCs.
1.7         Urban sanitation facilities have suffered similarly. Sewerage coverage,
at 60% of population, is higher in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) but low in other cities,
including Hanoi (30%) . The collection network is in need of extensive repair and
treatment of wastewater is non-existent leading to pollution of inner city waterways
and groundwater. Solid waste collection in city centers is well organized but
disposal suffers from lack of proper landfills. No facilities exist for disposal of
hazardous and industrial waste.
C. Sectoral Issues
1.8         The objective of rapidly overcoming the overwhelming quantitative and
qualitative deficiencies resulting from prolonged under-investment defines the key
sectoral problems. These pertain to mobilization of the resources required;
formulation of a sector strategy to most effectively utilize available resources and
to increase resource mobilization in the future; selection of a sector structure
best suited to achieving sector objectives; organization of enterprise management
to ensure financial sustainability of investments; and control of construction
quality to ensure physical sustainability of the assets provided. Second order
issues resulting from the pursuit of rapid sector development pertain to the
protection of vulnerable social groups and prevention of negative environmental
impacts.
1.9         Concerning mobilization of resources for the sector,  it has to be
recognized that at present the aggregate requirement of all infrastructure sectors
exceeds available resources resulting in allocations for particular sectors that are
insufficient to meet total demand. While private capital is flowing to Vietnam,
returns in a number of sectors are presently higher than those available in the
water supply and sanitation sector. Thus prioritization in the use of available
allocated resources and efforts to increase the attractiveness to private capital
are important sectoral issues.
1.10        The transition to a market economy in Vietnam gives rise to especially
challenging sectoral concerns. Sector policies, strategy, structure and organization
1 Non-revenue water (NRW) refers to the water produced that does not bring in revenue, inter alia, due to
losses in the network (leaks), pilferage, non-billing and inaccurate metering.

need to be compatible with an environment changing from a supply to a demand
orientation. Presently the most significant steps required pertain to the re-
orientation of enterprise management to providing water and sanitation services as
a business rather than exclusively as a social obligation, to the gradual
replacement of subsidies by user charges, and to the increased ability of
enterprises to make rational business decisions without unnecessary political
control. At the same time, because of the natural monopoly characteristic of the
sector, the role of state agencies needs to evolve into that of regulators rather
than providers of service (para 4.1).
1.11        Issues arising from the existence of a sector monopoly in a low-income,
market economy need to be anticipated. These pertain to consumer and environmental
protection and ensuring universal access in the case of an essential commodity like
water. Adequate regulation and tariff design are needed to take care of consumer
concerns while project and program planning are needed to cater for environmental
consequences of increased water supplies (para 5.3).
D. Government Strateqy for the Sector
1.12        Both supply and demand side considerations consequent  to economic
reforms have led the Government to focus attention on the water sector. Inadequate
infrastructure could undermine plans to attract foreign investment and tourism while
increased urbanization could overwhelm existing facilities and lead to social
dissatisfaction. Proposed environmental legislation requires improvements in water
quality and rising incomes and higher user charges increase consumer expectations
for better service levels. Thus, resource allocation for both quantitative and
qualitative investments is required.
1.13        Based on a UNDP/World Bank Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study
(1990)  and a Finnish-funded National Urban Water Supply Strategy  (1994),  the
Government has formulated a two-stage sector development strategy. The first stage
focuses on system rehabilitation and renovation to meet demand up to the year 2000
and on institutional strengthening of the WSCs to ensure that the physical
investments are sustainable. The second stage would address demand and capacity
expansion beyond the year 2000.
1.14        Physical targets in the strategy's first stage call for development in
53 provincial towns to serve 70-80o of their population. Estimated investments to
attain these goals would be of the order of US$ 1 billion. This far exceeds the
sectoral allocation of the Government. Since, at this stage, the country risks
remain too high, individual project size relatively small, and financial returns
inadequate to attract substantial private sector investment, the Government has
decided to request financing for the key cities targeted for priority development
(para 1.4) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for HCMC and IDA for Hanoi,
Haiphong, Danang and Quang Ninh; for the other towns it decided to use bilateral
low-cost or grant financing contributions as much as available.
1.15        The accompanying institutional strengthening aims to ensure that the
physical investments are sustained and operated efficiently. Elements of the
strengthening being coordinated with the State Enterprise Reform Program include
decentralization of responsibility to the provincial level; increased autonomy for
WSCs with elimination of overlapping jurisdictions; re-orientation of WSCs on a more

commercial foundation; increased cost recovery through user charges and gradual
elimination of central subsidies. Considerable external development support has also
been directed at institutional strengthening of national sector agencies to improve
capabilities to plan and prepare sector strategies and projects, to develop policy
guidelines, standards and procurement and construction guidelines, and to strengthen
project management, implementation and monitoring capacity.
1.16        The Government strategy does include involvement of the private sector
through Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) projects for bulk water provision mostly for
industrial estates where commercial tariffs are presently considered affordable.
However, water provision to urban customers is planned to remain the responsibility
of reformed State Enterprises at least in the first stage to the year 2000.
E. IDA Strategy and Rationale for Involvement
1.17        The IDA approach formulated in the Country Assistance Strategy2 is in
agreement with the Government's two-stage sector development plan which is based on
the UNDP/World Bank Sector Study and the National Urban Water Supply Strategy. The
CAS identifies poor infrastructure as a key bottleneck to development, transition
to a market economy as a prime objective and reform of State Enterprises as an
important goal. The CAS states that the Bank would take the lead among donors to
help the Government plan and finance infrastructure. Commercialization of the WSCs
would also indirectly support the goal of poverty alleviation by redirecting
existing subsidies to WSCs for other activities with higher social returns.
1.18        The IDA strategy places greater emphasis on institutional strengthening
of the WSCs to ensure that the investments are sustained and operated efficiently
and that the sector becomes attractive for private sector participation. However,
it is clear that institutional improvements alone are not sufficient to meet the
targets for the year 2000. In particular, water services cannot be improved without
increasing the capacity and operational efficiency of treatment plants and physical
leakages cannot be reduced without major replacement of obsolete tertiary pipelines.
In addition, improved revenue collection requires investment in metering of
household connections. Thus the IDA strategy is based on a judicious mix of
essential physical investments supported by the institutional development necessary
to sustain the physical investments. Available documentation confirms that the ADB
is also following a similar strategy for its investment in HCM City.

II. SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA
A. The Project Area
2.1         Based on the Government's regional priorities (para 1.4), the project
would include investments in Hanoi, Haiphong, Danang and Halong City/Cam Pha (Quang
Ninh province). Hanoi-Haiphong-Quang Ninh form the northern economic triangle and
Danang is the focal point for development in central Vietnam. Danang (close to the
historic city of Hue) and Halong City (located on Halong Bay, a UNESCO World
Heritage site) are also marked for development as tourist attractions. Hanoi,
Haiphong and Danang are cities with provincial status.
B. Population
2.2         Hanoi is the national capital and second largest municipality after HCM
City. Urban population was 1.1 million in 1995 and is expected to reach 1.5 million
by 2010. The urban area is projected to grow from 50 km2 in 1990 to 83 km2 in 2010.
Haiphong is the main seaport in northern Vietnam and the fourth largest
municipality. Urban population was 430,000 in 1995 and is projected to reach 600,000
by 2010. The urban area is 20 km2. Danang, is the major deep-water seaport in
central Vietnam with good access to communications networks through National Highway
#1 and the Trans-Vietnam railway. It is the third largest municipality in the
country. The 1995 urban population of 450,000 is expected to reach 600,000 by 2010.
2.3         Quang Ninh province, the country's principal coal exporter, is situated
about 160 km northeast of Hanoi. It is small province with a population of 900,000,
of which about 36% (320,000) are urban. The two urban communities, Halong City and
Cam Pha, are both important ports. Halong City is the provincial capital; it's
western section (Bai Chai) is developing a tourist center separated from the rest
of the city by the mouth of the Dien Vong River. Cam Pha lies along the coast to
the northeast, about 20 km from Halong City. The combined population of the two
cities is expected to grow from 278,000 in 1995 to 500,000 in 2010, mainly by
absorbing neighboring districts into an urban agglomeration.
C. Water Supply
2.4         Water supply services are provided to domestic, commercial, industrial
and institutional consumers by provincial WSCs responsible to the provincial
People's Committees (PCs) . In 1995, the Hanoi Water Business Company (WBC) served
900,000 residents (82% of the urban population) and other consumers through 123,000
connections and 1000 standposts. Average production was 320,000 m3/d of which 69%
was NRW.   Estimated domestic consumption was 120 lcd. The Haiphong WSC served
420,000 residents (98% of the urban population) and the others through 56,000
connections and 650 standposts. Average production was 125,000 m3/d of which about
69% was NRW. The Danang WSC served 191,000 residents (47% of the urban population)
and the others through 21,000 connections. Average production was 52,000 m3/d, of
which 33% was NRW. The Quang Ninh WSC served 43,200 residents (15% of the urban
population) and the others through 13,000 connections.   Average production was
28,000 m3/d of which 56% was NRW.
2.5         Of the total connections, 25% are metered in Hanoi, 56% in Haiphong,
100% in Danang and 50% in Quang Ninh. Numerous meters are out of order and many



6
commercial establishments are registered as domestic consumers qualifying for a
lower tariff. Non-metered domestic consumers are billed a fixed monthly charge based
on an estimated consumption of 3-6 m3 per capita per month. Non-metered commercial
and industrial consumers are charged based on negotiated contracts related to
estimated monthly usage. Both situations lead to excessive water use, sharing of
connections between families, incentives for meter tampering and leakage of revenue
in contracts based on estimation of monthly usage.
2.6         With some exceptions in Hanoi, the condition of water supply facilities
is poor and treatment facilities are overloaded. Existing water demand cannot be
met, large segments of population must use private, unhygienic wells where
groundwater is accessible, and the quality of piped water is below national
standards. Tertiary distribution networks have not been developed in any of the
cities. They have been replaced by extremely long individual connections (spaghetti
connections)  that draw water directly from mains.   However,  these were never
pressurized over one bar; also, external and internal corrosion is common, and
joints and fittings are leaking, generally beyond repair (see Annex 1 for a detailed
description of water supply, sewerage and solid waste services).
D. Sewerage. Drainage and Solid Waste
2.7         Sewerage service is provided by the Sewerage and Drainage Companies
(SDCs) in Hanoi and Haiphong and Urban Environment Companies (URENCOs) in Danang,
Halong City and Cam Pha.  In addition to sewerage and drainage, URENCOs manage
street cleaning, solid waste collection and disposal, and maintain public toilets,
parks and street lights. The SDCs and URENCOs are State Enterprises but unlike WSCs
are responsible to municipal and not to provincial PCs.
2.8         The existing drains are combined sewers' serving city centers. They are
over 50 years old, built during the French period. Hanoi SDC maintains 120 km of
sewers and 35 km of open channels serving about 30% of the urban area; the Haiphong
SDC maintains 170 km serving three urban districts; the Danang URENCO maintains 37
km serving about 30% of the urban area and the Halong and Cam Pha URENCOs maintain
about 53 km. The systems are overloaded and in poor condition, often flood severely
for extended periods, and discharge wastewater without treatment. The population
without access to the sewer systems uses on-site sanitation, mostly septic tanks
without adequate drain fields. Only about 35%-40% of the solid waste generated is
collected. The rest is burned or buried at the source or scattered. The existing
landfills do not comply with environmental and health requirements, are mostly
filled, and will need to be closed soon.
E. Project Demand and Rationale
2.9         In 1991, the Government asked the IDA to help prepare a water supply and
sanitation project to remedy the above-mentioned deficiencies in the four cities.
The objective of the water supply component was to meet coverage and consumption
' Combined sewers provide the service in one pipe for surface water drainage as well as wastewater, which
must first pass through septic tanks (or suitable pre-treatment) to remove solids and toxins before entering the sewer.
Separate sewers provide a separate pipe for each service.



7
targets for the year 2000, improve water quality, rehabilitate facilities, reduce
physical leakages and to improve institutional capacity of the WSCs. The objective
of the sanitation component was to rehabilitate drainage and sewerage networks,
improve flood protection, improve solid waste management, provide new sanitary
landfills, and strengthen operating agencies. During preparation, however, it was
found that the great number of involved institutions with various financial
objectives would make the project very complex (para 3.4) . It was decided,
therefore, to reformulate the initial project into a water supply project to be
processed first and a sanitation project to follow later.
2.10        Investments  in the water  supply  sector are needed now.  Deferred
investments have had a negative effect on national development plans and the quality
of urban life and further delays would increase the final cost of rehabilitation.
Historic funding levels have been low. During 1983-86, urban water supply
expenditures were less than 1.5% of the Government's total capital investments,
while provincial contributions to water supply projects accounted for 5-7% of total
provincial budgets. Allocations increased to 6% of total central Government
investment by 1989, but decreased in real terms, from US$ 8.3 million in 1983 to US$
0.4 million in 1989. Including provincial capital allocations, this corresponded to
an overall investment volume of US$ 0.56 million in 1989. Similarly, capital
investment levels in sewerage and waste removal in the three major cities was less
than US$ 1.5 million by 19922.
2.11        While the low funding partially reflects the low absorptive capacity of
the sector, the constraints have been gradually removed. Progressive reforms have
delegated more responsibilities to the provinces and increased the autonomy and
responsibilities of the WSCs including the ability to borrow for capital expansion.
At the same time, the provinces have allowed the WSCs to retain funds that were
earlier paid back to the province (e.g., depreciation charges) in order to augment
their ability to self-finance their operations. Tariffs have also been increased
significantly in real terms and subsidies have been curtailed to move the WSCs
towards a more customer and efficiency oriented mode of operation. While
institutional reforms need to continue, they have progressed to the stage where
project investments in the WSCs are feasible.
2.12        There  are  no  viable  project  alternatives.  From  a  development
perspective, the investment forms an integral part of the overall development of the
three key economic regions identified by the Government. From a financing
perspective, Government resources are insufficient and private sector investment is
not forthcoming at present without tariff increases that would be politically and
socially unsustainable3.  From an engineering perspective, complete replacement of
the run-down systems would be prohibitively expensive and presently unaffordable.
Use of development assistance for judicious rehabilitation of existing assets,
2 Historical investments in the sector are reported in "Business Opportunities in Vietnam in the Water
Supply and Sanitation Sector," GKW Consult, 1994. The report is available in the project file.
3 The long run marginal cost of water in Hanoi is presently estimated to be more than double the existing
average water tariff.

essential capacity expansion and institutional change to increase operational
efficiency remains the least cost and most affordable alternative.
F. Related Projects and Lessons Learnt
2.13        As a result of low national funding allocations and Vietnam's economic
isolation, international counterpart financing in the water sector has been slow.
Assistance to the sector since 1985 has not exceeded US$ 100 million. The most
significant projects which can yield useful lessons have been financed by.Finnida.
The first project in Hanoi is now in its third and final phase with cumulative
investment up to 1995 of US$80 million. The second project started in Haiphong in
1990 and cumulative investment has been approximately US$20 million.
2.14        Valuable lessons can be derived from a comparison of the experiences of
the two projects. The Hanoi project was started in 1985 before sector reforms were
initiated in Vietnam and, as an emergency, was managed by a contractor focusing on
physical investments. While significant physical investments have been made in the
network and water quality has improved, WBC performance and customer service levels
have not shown commensurate improvement. After 10 years, NRW remains above 60%.
Lessons from the Hanoi experience have been utilized in the design of the Haiphong
project with better results. There has been a greater emphasis on initial
engineering preparation and institutional development; the community-based model
chosen for system rehabilitation at the neighborhood level has reduced NRW from over
60% to below 40% in the rehabilitated areas.
2.15        However,  further explanation is needed for the differences  since
institutional development efforts initiated in Hanoi since 1990 have not yielded
similar results. Part of the reason lies in the nature of the physical systems in
the two cities. Hanoi, with easy access to groundwater, has never generated
sufficient pressure on the PC or WBC management to change established modes of
operation. By contrast, Haiphong with no access to groundwater was faced with acute
water scarcity in the summer of 1993 with rioting directed against the WSC resulting
in the death of a company employee. As a result, the PC changed the WSC management,
and gave a clear mandate to the new Director to show results. The combination of
accountability from above and pressure from below provided the driving force for
improved performance. These lessons are being incorporated in the project by
institutionalizing the two driving forces through annual performance agreements
between the PCs and WSCs and public performance audits to increase consumer
involvement (paras 4.19 & 4.21).
2.16        Analysis of the Danang WSC confirms the above observations.  Acute
scarcity of water owing to very limited treatment capacity has forced PC involvement
and WSC efficiency in operations. As a result 100% of the connections are metered,
disconnection policies are strictly enforced, and billing and collection monitored.
As a result NRW is about 33% and performance bonuses from retained earnings yield
employee salaries double those in Hanoi. This confirms the assessment that
significant improvements can be made to the distribution system and the methods
employed for metering, billing and collection, often without major capital
expenditure. Therefore, these components are an essential part of the project and
the basis for projecting NRW to decrease from over 60% in some WSCs to about 40% by
the time steady state conditions are achieved.



9
2.17        The Hanoi and Haiphong experiences also suggest lessons for the design
of institutional and technical assistance components. While this remains a
contentious issue, appraisal assessment is that the strategy of seconding long-term
advisors as management counterparts without time-bound, task-specific assignments
subject to periodic evaluation is not the most cost effective. Lack of a credible
option of withdrawing advisors if essential recommendations are not implemented
undermines project effectiveness and is ultimately counterproductive. Technical
assistance components in the project will be focused on specific, monitorable tasks
to be completed within specified time periods. Inclusion of Hanoi in the project was
made conditional on the introduction of a credible program to reduce NRW. The PC
responded with a concrete measure, signing a contract with an international private
water operator to initiate customer management in one supply district. The first
phase of the contract is due to be completed in March 1997 and the current results
are promising.
2.18        While the project would be the first IDA involvement in the sector and
first project to deal with subnational entities, lessons based on the Bank's global
experience are incorporated in the project design. The principal lesson is that
sector projects should not be used as vehicles to pursue subsidiary objectives at
the expense of the main objective. Thus tariffs should not be distorted to satisfy
poverty alleviation objectives; instead, direct subsidies should be provided to
needy households, if warranted. Similarly, water supply projects should not be used
to develop the construction industry if such development affects construction
quality. Dividing procurement packages into small contracts with the simplest sub-
components (e.g., house and meter connections) reserved for the smallest and least
experienced contractors has yielded an extremely expensive lesson. Poor construction
of such sub-components results in over 95k of physical leakages which are hard to
detect and expensive to repair because the assets are underground. The procurement
arrangements for the project have been designed to eliminate such problems.
2.19        Cautionary lessons have been learnt from the experience of the ADB
financed project in HCM City. The project which was signed in 1994 was suspended in
December 1996 because of slow implementation and disbursement. The project included
33 procurement packages each of which had to be evaluated and separately approved
by the Prime Minister. As the first multilateral funded projects at the provincial
level in a changing sector environment, it is to be expected that unanticipated new
issues would arise during project preparation and implementation that would take
time and patience to resolve.
2.20        Another key lesson from the Bank's global experience is to avoid trying
to do to much in one project and to refrain from attempting policy or procedural
changes that cut across sectors. The project design is not over-ambitious and
recognizes that all sector objectives cannot be achieved in one project because of
the constraints imposed by the realities on the ground (first time borrower, first
project dealing directly with State Enterprises at the sub-national level, a
transition economy in which sector policies are not firmly established, provincial
and enterprise management relatively unfamiliar with the requirements of market-
based operations, low staff salaries, consumer affordability considerations, limited
counterpart funds, limited debt service capability and limited absorptive capacity).
Therefore, the project has been designed as part of a careful, phased strategy
structured around an investment program comprising in the four cities at least two
separate water supply and sanitation projects each. The first water supply project



10
includes measures that are most critical and yield the greatest immediate benefits
while setting in motion policy reforms and actions that would ensure the successful
attainment of all objectives by the completion of the investment program. However,
reform of generic problems cutting across sectors such as unsystematic loan
processing procedures or cumbersome funds flow arrangements at the country level are
not and cannot be addressed through the project.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Oriqin and History
3.1         The Government's  goal with respect  to urban water supply and
sanitation is to improve the quality of drinking water and waste water, to
develop infrastructure to meet defined targets and to commercialize the operating
companies. To achieve these objectives, it has sought external financing. In
1991, it requested IDA funding for a water supply and sanitation project in four
major cities and secured bilateral assistance to prepare the project from Finland
(for Hanoi and Haiphong), Denmark (for Quang Ninh) and Australia (for Danang).
3.2         Project processing was held up till 1993 because of delays in signing
agreements between the Government and bilateral donors. Project reviews in 1993
identified project complexity as a major risk since water supply, sewerage and
sanitation services are provided by different companies with different funding
arrangements. However, it was decided to proceed with the project design on the
grounds that the Ministry of Construction (MOC), responsible for urban water
supply and sanitation at the national level, would coordinate the project
components. As part of project preparation, technical assistance was arranged
from Australian aid to strengthen the regulatory capacity of the MOC.
3.3         However,  in  1995,  further  to  the  decentralization  of  sector
responsibilities to the provincial level, the Government decided that MOC would
remain actively responsible for managing projects only in secondary cities. Major
cities, which included those in the IDA-assisted project, would be directly
responsible for their projects. While institutionally this constituted a step in
the right direction, freeing the WSCs from parallel chains of command,
operationally it resulted in the project design becoming unmanageable.
3.4         As a result, it was agreed to divide the initial project into two,
a water supply project, to be processed first and a sanitation project to follow
later, and to outline a sector investment program for the four cities as follows:
(a) Water Supply Project to be implemented in 1997 to rehabilitate existing
facilities and meet demand up to 2000; (b) Sanitation Project to be implemented
in 1999 to restore functionality of existing sewerage and drainage facilities,
to provide septic tank maintenance program and to improve solid waste management
including construction of sanitary landfills; (c) Second Water Supply Project to
be implemented from 2000 to expand capacity to meet demand up to 2010; and (d)
Second Sanitation Project to be implemented in 2002 to expand wastewater
collection and treatment to handle the increased water production resulting from
the Second Water Supply Project. The sanitation projects would exclude sewerage
and drainage in Hanoi which is being funded by OECF of Japan and possibly solid
waste management. Both the Second Water Supply Project and the Second Sanitation
Project would be prepared within the respective first projects.
B. Objectives and Design
3.5         The aims of the first water supply project in the four cities are to:
(a) improve the quality of water supply services in Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh
and Danang through renovation of existing facilities in order to satisfy demand
up to 2000 of about 2.5 million people in the cities; (b) ensure sustainability



12
of the physical investments by developing the institutional capabilities of water
supply agencies, facilitating their commercialization, and upgrading their staff
skills through training; and (c) assist in preparation of a future investment
program to satisfy water demand after 2000.
3.6         At the present time, a project based on concessional financing,
maximum rehabilitation of existing facilities, limited capacity expansion and
concentrated institutional improvements is the dominant, least cost alternative.
Government resources are insufficient and private investment is not forthcoming
in distribution of essential services because of unfavorable risk/return
characteristics. Large scale replacement of existing facilities is unaffordable
since tariff increases to meet full cost recovery are only possible in a
graduated manner because of social and political implications.
3.7         To ensure that the selection of engineering sub-components conformed
to the specific needs and preferences of the individual cities, the following
mechanism was adopted. Based on an initial assessment of the financial capacity
of the WSCs, an investment envelope was allocated to the WSC. The WSCs, in
collaboration with engineering consultants, identified alternative sub-components
to meet given project objectives (coverage, consumption and quality targets)
which were assigned weights depending upon the specific situation of each city.
Sub-components were ranked based on their overall impact measured in terms of
expected contribution to each target weighted by the importance of the target.
The rankings, made independently by consultants and WSCs, were discussed in a
meeting attended by members of the provincial administration, and the highest
ranked sub-components within the investment envelope were included in the
project. The remaining sub-components were deferred for consideration in the
follow-up project. This procedure ensured that the selection of sub-components
was made in a participatory manner and that the project is optimally sized, not
too large to be financially unsustainable by the WSCs and not too small to fall
short of essential targets.
C. Description
3.8         The project would include the following elements:  (a) renewal and
upgrading of water supply facilities in the urban districts of Hanoi, Haiphong
and Danang, and Halong/Cam Pha in Quang Ninh province; (b) institutional measures
to ensure sustainability of the physical investments; (c) support activities
consisting of various studies, advisory services, supervision of construction and
training; and (d) resettling and rehabilitating the population affected by the
project. The project locations are shown on maps IDA Nos 28592 through 28595 and
a detailed description is provided in Annex 2.
3.9         The renewal and upgrading of water supply facilities would include
the following:
In Hanoi, (a) production wells and two treatment plants; (b) primary, secondary
and tertiary distribution networks, including large water meters; and (c) new
water connections, replacement of existing connections made of galvanized steel
(GS) pipe and provision of water meters.
In Haiphong, (a) a raw water pumping station and raw water transmission main; (b)



13
a treatment plant; (c) primary and secondary distribution pipelines, including
a balancing reservoir; (d) a tertiary distribution network in 17 wards (phuongs)
with water connections and provision of water meters; and (e) equipment,
materials and vehicles for operations and maintenance.
In Danang, (a) a water intake, transmission main and access road; (b) a treatment
plant and reservoir; (c) a treated water transmission main, primary, secondary
and tertiary distribution network with connections and provision of water meters;
and (d) equipment, materials and vehicles for operations and maintenance.
In Quang Ninh, (a) deep wells; (b) raw water transmission and raw water pumping
stations; (c) two treatment plants; (d) transmission and primary distribution
mains; (e) a secondary and tertiary distribution network with connections and
provision of water meters, booster pumping stations and water reservoirs; and (f)
equipment, materials and vehicles for operations and maintenance.
3.10        Institutional measures in WSCs would include:  (a) upgrading the
accounts receivable systems; (b) improving customer management (mapping,
registration, disconnections-reconnections, etc.); and (c) preparation of O&M
guidelines for each WSC as a basis for establishing adequate budget allocations
which is an essential condition for upgrading of operation and maintenance
procedures to sustainable levels; (d) corporate planning models.
3.11        Support activities would include construction management and various
studies concerning (a) the quality of surface water sources, evaluating monitored
data, and identifying actions aimed at protecting the sources against pollution;
(b) identifying, quantifying, monitoring and evaluating NRW; (c) periodic audit
of the safety of Cao Van dam in Quang Ninh (para 3.33) and introducing corrective
actions, and (d) staff training and professional evaluation of managers and
operators in collaboration with international private water system operators.
TORs for institutional and support activities and various studies are listed in
Annex 13 (1-09, 2-09, 3-09, 4-16) and available in the project file.
3.12        The follow-up water supply investment and institutional development
program would expand water production and distribution capacity to meet system
demands beyond 2000 and position the WSCs for self-financing and private sector
participation. TORs for the engineering components should be completed by the
WSCs in March 1999. TORs for the institutional components would be formulated
following the mid-term review of the first water supply project.
D. Status of Preparation
3.13        The WSCs, assisted by consultants engaged under bilateral grants,
have completed preliminary or detailed engineering designs'; pre-qualification
and bidding documents for Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh were completed in April
1997 and for Danang will be completed in July 1997.   The designs follow
international standards for the water supply sector and have been technically
reviewed by Bank staff and found satisfactory. Pre-qualification and bidding
documents follow the Bank's standard documents.

3.14        On the institutional side, technical assistance at the national level
for the MOC consisting of capacity building for project design and management,
preparation of design and construction guidelines and implementation of training
curricula carried out under a separate Australian assistance has been completed.
A pilot program to improve customer management has been started in Hanoi WBC by
Saur International (SI), a reputed private water system operator. Also, billing
and collection procedures in Hanoi WBC have been evaluated by an accounting firm,
Coopers and Lybrand. The firm was employed under a PHRD grant in January 1997 to
improve the procedures and the accounts receivable system in Haiphong.  As.a part
of institutional effort and commercialization of WSCs a workshop to be organized
by the EDI is planned for August 1997 to transfer the Bank's global experience
in performance agreements, public performance audits (para 4.21) and corporate
modeling to key policy and decision makers and related academics in Vietnam.
3.15        Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and environmental management
plans (EMPs) for the four cities were prepared as part of preliminary designs.
Resettlement action plans (RAPs) for Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang were
prepared as part of detailed designs before appraisal (para 3.27) . The EIAs for
the components were cleared and approved by the Ministry of Science, Technology,
and Environment (MOSTE) in August and October 1996. The EMPs were reviewed during
appraisal and are satisfactory.
E. Cost Estimates
3.16        The project cost is estimated at VND 1569.21 billion (US$142.66
million), with a foreign currency requirement estimated at VND 812.98 billion
(US$73.91 million) or 52% of the total.   Base costs reflect June 1996 price
levels. Physical contingencies are estimated at US$5.89 million or 5% of base
costs; price contingencies are at US$18.94 million, or about 16% of base costs
plus physical contingencies, and assume annual rates of inflation for local costs
of 7% for 1997, 6% for 1998-1999 and 5% for 2000-2004.   For foreign costs,
inflation is estimated at 2.3% from 1996 onwards. Cost estimates were based on
preliminary designs of the Quang Ninh and Danang components and completed
detailed designs of the Hanoi and Haiphong components.
3.17        The total cost of implementation support is estimated at US$15.85
million, which represents about 3,350 person-months, 2,250 of which would be for
supervision of construction and 1,100 for various studies and training.  The
input of national consultants is estimated at 2,700 person-months while
expatriate input is estimated at 650 person-months. Cost estimates are listed
in Annex 3 and summarized in Table 3.1.

F. Financing Plan
3.18        The proposed IDA credit would be funded under the Interim Trust Fund
(ITF) administered by IDA and subject to special provisions on procurement. The
credit of SDR 71.3 million (US$98.61 million equivalent) would finance 69% of
project costs net of duties and taxes. Finland would finance US$3.89 million for
studies, advisors and training in Hanoi and Haiphong, Denmark would finance
US$4.7 million for studies, advisors, training and construction supervision,
US$3.06 million for installation of individual connections2 and US$5.0 million
for construction of water supply facilities3 in Quang Ninh, and Australia would
finance US$1.33 million for studies,  advisors and training in Danang.   The
remaining US$26.07 million would be financed locally. The plan is summarized in
Table 3.2.
2 Danish grant to GOV would be administered by Denmark and onlent to Quang Ninh WSC for installing
water connections under the same terms as the IDA credit.
3 Administered by IDA and subject to special provisions regarding procurement.

3.19        The borrower would be the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  The 40-year
ITF credit would include 10 years of grace at standard IDA terms. The ITF credit,
Danish grant to GOV and Danish Trust Fund for Quang Ninh would be onlent to water
companies by the Government in VND on the following terms: The fixed interest
rate would be 6.5% per annum, the loan would be repayable over 20 years with a
5 year grace period. The Government would bear the exchange rate risk, and
interest during the grace period would be waived. The onlending terms take into
account the fact that the WSCs need a subsidy at this initial stage of their
restructuring. The waiver of the interest during construction is a special
contribution of the Government to the WSCs. Separate project agreements have been
executed between IDA and the WSCs with covenants on operational, financial and
monitoring aspects.
3.20        At negotiations the onlending terms were confirmed and assurances
obtained from the Government that it would provide through PCs local funds as
required by WSCs for carrying out their parts of the project. The execution of
the Australian, Danish and Finnish Grant Agreements, and Danish Trust Fund would
be a condition of effectiveness of the ITF credit. Execution of subsidiary loan
agreements between the Government and the WSCs would be a condition of
disbursement of the ITF credit for the respective project component.
G. Implementation
3.21        The WSC in each province would employ contractors to supply equipment
and construct the proposed facilities. In Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang, they would
also hire engineering firms to act as the construction management consultants
(CMC), while in Quang Ninh, the CMC would be provided through Danish aid. The
CMCs would report to WSC directors and for daily activities, the directors would
delegate responsibility to the component coordinators, who would head the
component implementation units (CIUs) within the WSCs. Together, the WSCs and



17
provincial governments have established component implementation committees
(CICs) to help the WSCs implement the works by facilitating administrative
actions. The CMCs would also serve as secretariats to the CICs and report on
implementation progress at regular meetings (see Chart 1).
3.22        Construction is expected to start in October 1997 and be completed
by June 2002 (para. 3.41) . Project works are expected to be operating in all WSCs
by the end of 2001, but the installation of water connections and other minor
works may extend for an additional six months.   The schedule  (Annex 4) is
considered realistic since each component involves just one contract for both
civil works and the supply and installation of goods. Supervision would be aided
by firms of consultants. Employment of construction management consultants
acceptable to IDA would be a condition of disbursement for the related part of
the project.
3.23        Institutional and other studies and training would be financed by
Finnish, Danish and Australian grants that would be provided to Vietnam under
bilateral agreements. The program of implementation support, training and outline
TOR for studies agreed upon with co-financing agencies are available in the
project file. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that beginning in 1997
WSCs would submit annual plans for implementation support and training to IDA
each year by October 30.
3.24        The WSCs have prepared project implementation plans that define the
scope and timing of actions needed to carry out the project. An understanding was
reached at negotiations that each WSC would carry out its project implementation
plan. The plans are available in the project file and summarized in Annex 5.
H. Land Acquisition and Resettlement
3.25        Water production facilities and transmission mains would require
acquisition of about 45 ha of land, of which 9 ha would be for temporary use and
36 ha for permanent use, involving in total 1,772 households. The Hanoi and
Haiphong components would not involve relocation of affected persons. In Hanoi,
12 ha would need to be acquired for permanent and 3 ha for temporary use
involving in total 1,362 households. In Haiphong, 1.5 ha would need to be
acquired for permanent use involving 44 households. The Quang Ninh component
would require 8 ha of land, of which 4 ha would be for temporary use, and 4 ha
for permanent use. Of 465 various structures located on top of water mains, some
would be demolished or relocated to ensure the pipelines are safe and to protect
water quality. This would involve 212 households in total. The Danang component
would require 20 ha of land of which 2 ha would be for temporary use, and 18 ha
for permanent use. About 13 structures would be partly demolished and remodelled
on their plots. Land acquisition would involve 154 households of which 13 would
have structures affected.
3.26        Collection of data on distribution pipelines prior to appraisal was
not feasible since their exact location will be known only at implementation.
Thus, in respect of distribution components, RAPs with data on specific
resettlement activities would be completed when all the information on the land
to be acquired and its owners are available, and submitted to IDA for approval
prior to start of works. All distribution pipelines would be under public roads.



18
It is estimated that approximately 150 ha of land would need to be acquired for
temporary use. The policy framework for these (distribution) RAPs would be the
same as outlined in the RAPs for transmission components (paras 3.27 and 3.28).
3.27        Following  OD 4.30  on  Involuntary Resettlement,  WSCs  submitted
satisfactory resettlement action plans (RAPs) which include a policy framework,
detailed Action Plans for the production and transmission components of the
project and provision for preparing Action Plans for the distribution components.
The RAPs were approved by the respective PCs and by the Government of Vietnam.
The Prime Minister's approval includes special decisions releasing the
enforcement of Vietnamese regulations related to replacement rates for valuation
of assets and to non-compensation to unauthorized settlers on acquired land.
3.28        Implementation of detailed RAPs would be regularly supervised and
monitored by WSCs and reported to the respective Component Implementation
Committee and PC. The status would also be included in semi-annual progress
reports submitted to IDA. In addition, an external agency, acceptable to IDA,
would be employed by WSCs to semi-annually carry out monitoring and evaluation
of RAP implementation and to prepare a final report on completion of each RAP.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the WSCs would implement their
respective RAPs and would arrange for: (i) semiannual progress reports on WSCs'
supervision and monitoring of resettlement activities; (b) starting from December
31, 1997, an independent semi-annual monitoring of RAPs' implementation; and
(iii) final report on completion of each RAP. IDA approval of a detailed
(distribution) RAP in respect of each distribution network site would be required
prior to commencement of works on that part of the project. These would be
prepared by WSCs and approved by PCs. The establishment of Resettlement
Committees by each of the PCs pursuant to the provisions of the RAPs would be a
condition of effectiveness of the ITF credit.
3.29        The Quang Ninh component would draw water from the reservoir created
by the Cao Van dam. The filling of the reservoir in 1996 involved the
resettlement of 117 families  (688 individuals)  belonging to the Do ethnic
minority. The Government started the resettlement in early 1992 by meeting with
affected households and by December 1996 the resettlement was completed. The
households selected the areas where they wanted to settle: 69 households
resettled in Gia Lai province in the Central Highlands while 48 households
resettled within Quang Ninh province. In addition to provision of land for land,
compensation at replacement rates was paid for houses, trees, crops and other
assets lost, along with transport to the new area. Civic infrastructure, such
as roads and schools, was provided in the new areas.
3.30        A resettlement specialist on indigenous people reviewed the program's
status in October 1996. He concluded that: (a) the Cao Van construction planning
and design included resettlement costs; (b) its organization followed government
guidelines and decisions, with budgetary allocations and funds disbursed
annually; (c) the affected population was recognized as a special ethnic group;
(d) resettlement locations were chosen by the project affected people (PAP) and
the move was implemented in several phases, accommodating expressed preferences
and customs; and (e) the resettled households have legal access to productive
resources that allow for sustainable, but relatively intensified annual cropping
patterns. The report is available in the project file. In March 1997, a field



19
visit was made to Gia Lai province where 69 affected households have relocated.
A number of issues pertaining to this resettlement are considered outstanding.
These include completion of facilities for and asset transfer to households
resettled in Gia Lai province (5.3 ha of land, electrical connections to 25
families and dry season irrigation facility) and information on living standards
of 12 families who self-relocated in Quang Ninh province. Necessary actions
pertaining to these were agreed at negotiations and covenanted in the Project
Agreement. Compliance with the obligation to provide the assets (land and
electrical connections) to households resettled in Gia Lai province would be a
condition of disbursement of the proceeds of the credit earmarked to finance all
of Quang Ninh WSC project components. A dated covenant, June 30, 1998, was
included in the Project Agreement with regard to completion of the irrigation
facility in Gia Lai province.
I. Safety of Cao Van dam
3.31        The Cao Van dam was designed,  constructed and financed by the
Government. The dam is an earthfill structure 28 m high and 225 m long creating
a reservoir with a water volume of about 11 million m3. Construction of the dam
started in 1992 and was essentially completed in early 1996. Minor works such as
clearing, planting of grass and some reforestation will extend to 1997. The
purpose of the reservoir is to immediately provide about 60,000 m3/d of raw water
for Halong water supply system which will be increased to 120,000 m3/d after the
dam is raised in about 2010.
3.32        On IDA request the Quang Ninh WSC, assisted by Danish aid, arranged
in 1995 for an independent dam specialist4 to (a) inspect and evaluate the
safety status of the Cao Van dam, and (b) provide recommendations on any safety-
related remedial measures5. In his finding, the specialist stated that the
construction was carried out to a good standard and no safety problems should
occur when the dam is completed and recommended that the design flood and the
hydraulic design of the spillway be further studied. In addition, the report
suggested that (a) routine safety inspections of the dam should be carried out
by the safety engineer of Quang Ninh WSC twice a year, and (b) independent safety
inspections by an independent specialist be carried out annually. The inspection
report is available in the project file.
3.33        The Quang Ninh  WSC  has  agreed  to  implement  the  specialist's
recommendations and the Danish aid program includes the carrying out of the
recommended studies and assistance with periodical safety inspections (para
3.11) . TOR for the studies are available in the project file. At negotiations
assurances were obtained that the Quang Ninh WSC would furnish by December 31,
1997 proposed arrangements for periodic inspections of the Cao Van dam and that
it would implement recommendations of such inspections thereafter.
4 Mr. David Morris, Member of "All Reservoirs" Panel set up in accordance with Reservoirs Act 1975
under United Kingdom legislation.
I Inspections of dams which are not part of the project but necessary for its performance is required by the
OP 4.37, Safety of Dams (September 1996).

J. Procurement
3.34        Procurement would be carried out according to the Guidelines for IBRD
Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, revised in January and August 1996 6.
The four major supply and installation contracts that comprise the bulk of
procurement (US$111.33 million) would involve supplying and installing mechanical
and electrical equipment. These contracts would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB) following the pre-qualification of bidders and using
the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), Standard Pre-qualification Document
and Standard Bid Evaluation Form. ICB procedures and SBDs would also be used to
procure most of the vehicles and equipment (US$2.09 million) . Small equipment for
maintaining the network, workshops and laboratories, and office equipment
packaged in individual contracts that do not exceed US$100, 000 each or US$890, 000
altogether, would be procured by shopping7. These would consist of small value
contracts awarded by the four WSCs. For procurement under ICB procedures,
domestic goods, plant and equipment would be allowed a preference margin of 15%
or the amount of customs duties, whichever is lower, for bid evaluation. A
general procurement notice was published on March 31, 1996. In addition, specific
procurement notices will be advertised for all contracts exceeding $10 million
for goods and works and $200,000 for consultants. No mandatory associations
between foreign and local consultants will be permitted. Further general
procurement notices will be issued for outstanding project components including
expected consultancy assignments. Prequalification notices were published in
Development Business. Procurement arrangements are detailed in Annex 4 and
summarized in Table 3.3.
6 Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1.6 of the Guidelines, the proceeds of the Interim Fund Credit
may only be withdrawn on account of expenditures for goods, works and services provided by nationals of, and
produced in or supplied from ITF Participating Countries.
7 For international shopping, a minimum of three quotations from at least two countries will be solicited.
For national shopping, three quotations will be obtained from qualified suppliers. Requests for quotations will also
indicate the specifications, quantity and time-frame for delivery.

f/ Consultant services
3.35        Construction management consultants for Hanoi and Haiphong were
short-listed and the Letter of Invitation was approved by the Bank before March
1, 1997 in accordance with Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981) . Those for
Danang would be short-listed in accordance with the revised Guidelines for
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997)8.
Consultants would be selected following the Quality- and Cost-Based Selection
(QCBS) method and use the Standard Contract for Consultants' Services produced
in June 1995. The construction management consultant for Quang Ninh financed by
Danida has been employed on basis of terms of reference and qualifications
satisfactory to IDA.
3.36        IDA's prior review would be mandatory for all supply and install
contracts and those for equipment and materials of more than US$100,000. This
would cover about 90% of the value of the goods contracts and 100% of the supply
and install contracts. All other contracts would be subject to IDA's post review
procedures on the basis of a sufficient number of transactions selected randomly
8 Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph 1.02 of the Guidelines, only consultants from Participating
Countries shall be eligible to provide services financed out the proceeds of the Interim Fund Credit.

to achieve a sampling ratio of 1 in 10. All contracts with consulting firms,
except for those of under US$100,000 (for selection under QCBS), or for
individuals  estimated  to  cost  less  than  US$50,000  (for  selection  under
Consultants' Qualifications), would be subject to IDA's prior review procedures
for review of the terms of reference, estimates and criteria for short-listing.
Notwithstanding the above, IDA's prior review procedures for consultant services
apply to terms of reference, sole source selection and assignments of critical
nature.
K. Disbursement
3.37        The proceeds of the ITF credit and Danish fund would be disbursed
against: (a) 85t of total expenditures of supply and installation contracts; (b)
100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and materials; (c) 100% of
local expenditures (ex-factory) for domestically manufactured equipment and
materials, or 65% of local expenditures for other equipment and materials
procured locally and (d) 100% of total expenditures for consultant services.
3.38        Disbursement for equipment and material contracts of US$100,000 or
less, for services provided by consulting firms under contrcts of US$100,000 or
less, and for services provided by individual consultants under contracts of
US$50,000 or less would be made on the basis of a statement of expenditures
(SOE). Supporting documents for these expenditures would be retained by the
Government, made available for review by IDA supervision missions, and regularly
validated by independent auditors (para 5.10). To facilitate disbursements from
the credit, the WSCs may each open and maintain an ITF special deposit account
(Account) in a commercial bank authorized for this purpose, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA, including appropriate protection against set-off,
seizure or attachment.
3.39        Each of the Accounts would have an authorized allocation of US$1.0
million to be withdrawn from the credit account and deposited in the Account,
provided, however, that authorized allocation shall be limited to an amount
equivalent to US$500,000 until disbursement and outstanding commitments against
the credit allocated to each component equal or exceed the equivalent of SDR
700,000, unless IDA would otherwise agree. Applications to replenish the Account,
supported by documentation, would be submitted regularly (not less than
quarterly) or when the amount withdrawn equaled 30% of the initial deposit.
3.40        Full disbursement of the proceeds of the Danish Trust Fund will be
a condition of disbursement of the ITF credit earmarked for the respective
project component in Quang Ninh Province.
3.41        Project implementation would extend over four and a half years.
Project works are expected to be operating in all WSCs by the end of 2001, but
the installation of water connections and other minor works may extend for
additional six months, to June 30, 2002. The loan closing date would be December
31, 2002. The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 6) is based on the detailed
project implementation schedule which reflects simplified implementation through
one supply-and-install contract in each project component and advanced
procurement with completed pre-qualification at the time of Board presentation.
As there is no Bank disbursement profile available for water supply projects in



23
Vietnam, the comparison shows the Bank Standard Disbursement Profile (1995) for
water supply and sanitation projects in the East Asia and Pacific Region.
L. Environmental Impact
3.42         Implementation of the project would be beneficial for the living
standards and health conditions of the local population. Rehabilitation of the
existing facilities would reduce NRW while the expansion of treatment plants and
transmission and distribution lines would improve the quality and volume of
water, enhance service levels and raise revenues.
3.43        Negative impacts would include the acquisition of cultivated land,
demolition of structures and inconvenience for the residents during construction.
To mitigate these effects, the project would include environmental monitoring,
which would continue during implementation.   Land compensation would be paid
according to the RAPs. Other compensations would be made to government agencies
(where their property is affected) during the construction of water mains and
distribution networks.
3.44        Temporary  and  manageable  impacts  during  site  clearing  and
construction of the facilities would include increased levels of traffic, dust,
and noise; disruption of water supply; blocked drainage and water pollution due
to soil erosion at excavation sites; and disposal of surplus soil and
construction materials. The impacts on residential areas would be minor since
most of the WTPs, intakes, and other facilities would be situated away from
residential areas. The mountainous area in Quang Ninh where the raw water main
would be laid and the hill in Danang where the WTP would be constructed are
degraded areas and serious impacts on the local ecology are not expected.
3.45        In close consultation with the residents, the pipeline would be laid
along road shoulders where the impacts on households and businesses would be
minimal. During the design phase of the water mains and distribution pipelines,
efforts were made to minimize the impacts on burial grounds, houses, and
buildings, the need to obtain land and to excavate large quantities of soil.
3.46        The contractors would be required to carry out the planning and
construction according to contractual environmental specifications, including (a)
consultations with residents, (b) provision of safe temporary paths for residents
and businesses, (c) safety measures for the public and workers, (d) measures to
reduce erosion, dust, and noise levels due to construction, (e) limited transport
and construction along the main roads in urban areas during rush hours and in
residential  areas at night,  (f)  appropriate  disposal  of surplus  soil and
construction materials, and (g) provision of adequate water by alternate means
when piped water is interrupted.
3.47        Once operating, the WTPs would generate treatment sludge which would
be disposed of in retention lagoons in WTPs and, when dried, would be disposed
of in controlled landfills. Significant net increase of water supply is not
anticipated in the first project. The increased system capacity would displace
water from alternative sources being used by residents not presently served by
the piped system. Significant capacity expansion is planned for the second water
supply project. By that time, the first sanitation project currently being

prepared in the four cities (para 3.4) would have been implemented.
3.48        Potential impacts on land subsidence in Hanoi, dam safety in Quang
Ninh, salinity intrusion in Danang, and contamination of water quality at the
intakes and in the water supply systems in all project components have been
identified and will be addressed by the project's implementation support. These
include (a) monitoring of groundwater and land subsidence in Hanoi; (b) programs
to protect water resources and quality for each project component; (c) a safety
program at the Cao Van dam and (d) a program to ensure availability of water
resources in Danang.   TORs for these studies are in the project file and a
detailed description of the environmental impact including involuntary
resettlement is presented in Annex 7.
3.49        WSCs are willing to implement the project with due attention to
protection of environment through mitigating actions specified in the EMPs (para
3.15) and to comply with all the requirements issued by MOSTE within EIA
clearances. Compliance would be monitored by WSCs with the help of consultants
and periodically by the DOSTE in each province. For their part, residents would
participate throughout various stages of the planning and implementation of the
EMPs and the RAPs. Each household would be fully informed by the WSC, district
and communal peoples, committees.   The public relations program would be
continuous. At negotiations, WSCs confirmed that they would implement mitigating
actions specified in their individual EMPs.
M. Supervision and Performance Indicators
3.50        IDA's project supervision would require about 79 staff-weeks over the
life of the project, of which 20 staff-weeks would be at headquarters to review
progress reports, procurement actions and correspondence, 34 staff-weeks would
be in the field and 25 staff-weeks would be at the Bank's Resident Mission in
Vietnam (RMV) . Supervision by headquarters staff (sanitary engineers, financial
analysts and specialists in environmental issues) would focus on institutional
and physical progress while the involvement of RMV staff would center on
coordinating the project's four components. The borrower's contribution to
supervision would entail coordination of IDA visits and reports on various
subjects, such as regular reporting on implementation progress, evaluation
reports on project implementation, including plans for future operations of
respective components of the project.
3.51        Due to absence of a coordinating agency from early stages of project
preparation, the four WSCs started mutual consultations among themselves and, due
to advantageous location, the Hanoi WBC gradually assumed many of the
coordinating tasks. The WSCs therefore agreed that the Hanoi WBC would be
responsible for overall coordination of the project's four components. This would
include communications with the Government, administrative duties in connection
with visits of IDA missions in Vietnam, ensuring timely reporting on progress of
project components, etc. Managing the continuation of on-going consultations
among the WSCs on various technical and financial aspects related to project
implementation company management would be an important function. To facilitate
and expedite communication with IDA, which involves two languages, the Hanoi WBC
would be assisted by a sanitary engineer experienced in Bank procedures and



25
located in the RMV9. An understanding was reached at negotiations that overall
coordination of the project would be the responsibility of Hanoi WBC. A project
supervision plan is presented in Annex 8.
3.52        In addition  to input and output  indicators  used  for project
supervision, annual Performance Agreements between the Provincial Governments and
the WSCs linked to staff compensation are proposed to be used for evaluating WSC
performance and to strengthen management incentives. Also, Public Performance
Audits are proposed to be used to make comparative WSC performance information
available to the public to make consumer voice and benchmarking competition an
effective tool for improving performance. Impact, input and output indicators are
shown in Annex 11 (Table A 11.1). Based on the Performance/Risk Summary (Table
A 11.2), key performance indicators relevant for the project implementation phase
were identified (para 5.41) . These are presented in Table A 11.3 and were
confirmed at negotiations along with the contents of the Borrower's reports, as
outlined in Annex 8. A mid-term review of the project focusing primarily on the
institutional components would take place in June 1999.
9 The National Country Officer in Vietnam of the UNDP/WB Water and Sanitation Program is available
to provide part-time assistance for project coordination.

IV. THE INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS
A. Sector Structure
4.1         The Ministry of Construction  (MOC)  is the main national agency
responsible for water supply and sanitation. Through its departments and
enterprises, the MOC prepares national plans for the sector, regulates various
technical aspects of water and sanitation facilities, approves designs of major
projects, and assists in the implementation of water supply and sanitation
projects. In addition, it has wide responsibilities in areas of construction,
construction supervision and investment.
4.2         As part of decentralization, the responsibility for operating public
utilities, including water supply, was assigned to provinces with elimination of
MOC's direct involvement. PCs created Water Supply Companies (WSCs) as legal
entities1 to be responsible for construction, operation and maintenance of urban
water supply. The PCs have considerable influence on WSCs development policies,
including increased market orientation, setting targets for production and
distribution of water, deciding on WSCs financial policies, including the blend
of tariffs and subsidies. The organization structure of a typical Provincial
Government is shown in Chart 2. At negotiations assurances were obtained that the
Government would cause the PCs to take all actions to enable the respective WSCs
to implement the project and comply with their obligations.
4.3         Water supply services in the project cities are managed and operated
by WSCs which report to the respective PCs. The organization structure of a
typical WSC is shown in Chart 3.
4.4         The optimal sector structure for provision of urban water supply
services in Vietnam has been evaluated under an ADB financed technical
assistance. A number of alternatives including a national water supply company
and municipal companies were assessed but the existing structure based on
provincial WSCs was considered to offer the best potential for sector
development. The appraisal mission concurs with this recommendation. The sector
structure for provision of sewerage and sanitatiLon services would be reviewed in
detail as part of the preparation of the sanitation project.
B. Project Implementation
4.5         The project would be implemented in each province by the provincial
water company: the Hanoi Water Business Company (WBC), the Haiphong Water Supply
Company, the Quang Ninh Water Supply Company and the Danang Water Supply Company.
To aid implementation the WSCs have established Component Implementation
Committees (CICs) with the participation of the provincial PC. CICs are headed
by the Deputy Director of the Transport and Urban Public Works Service (TUPWS)
of the PC responsible for water supply in Hanoi, Haiphong and Danang and by the
Director of the Construction Department (CD) of the PC in Quang Ninh. CICs,
1 Details of establishing WSCs as legal entities with separate legal personality are included in the project's
legal documents.



27
supported by CMCs (para 3.21), would help the WSCs implement the works by
facilitating processing of various administrative actions within the PC including
budgetary planning and financial support. The CIC of each component would also
help the WSC evaluate various institutional and other studies, assist in
implementing proposed institutional improvements within the WSCIs organization,
and advise on content of annual plans for implementation support and training
activities to be provided through Finnish, Danish and Australian technical
assistance (para 3.23) . The implementing arrangements are shown schematically in
Chart 1. An understanding was reached at negotiations that the CIC would be
maintained for the duration of the project.
C. Staffing and Training
4.6         In 1995, the number of employees was 1,720 in Hanoi, 627 in Haiphong,
476 in Quang Ninh and 274 in Danang. Employees per 1,000 connections varied from
about 11 in Haiphong and Danang to 14 in Hanoi and 35 in Quang Ninh. Primarily
due to the projected rise in the number of connections, the ratio is expected to
stabilize below 10 by 2000 in all four cities which is acceptable and within
parameters of major Asian cities2.
4.7         Staff salaries conform to the general scales set by the Ministry of
Labor, but bonuses are also paid for achieving certain financial targets; thus,
income levels are affected by company performance. For example, since Hanoi 's WBC
has operated at a loss in recent years, salaries have been considerably lower
than in Danang and Haiphong, and top-quality employees have been hard to retain.
Those that stay often have to find additional work to meet their family needs.
4.8         Training levels also vary among the four companies, mainly due to the
resources available and management interest. In Hanoi and Haiphong, training has
been supported by the on-going Finnish Program. During this time, 188 staff from
the Hanoi WBC participated in overseas training or study tours, although some
left the company later, and in Haiphong, 17 staff participated in overseas study
tours. In September 1995, Haiphong WSC entered into a twinning-training agreement
with the water company in Turku, Finland and the Asian Institute of Technology
will train 11 Hanoi WBCs managers during 1996. In Quang Ninh and Danang,
resources have not been available for management training.
4.9         All  four WSCs  companies  recruit  technicians  such  as  welders,
electricians and plumbers who are formally trained in national or provincial
vocational schools. However, those working specifically in water trades (such
as pump operators, pipe fitters and meter readers, etc.) are trained in-house.
The training is provided by company engineers and technicians using course
material prepared by the company and normally results in examinations and
improved salary grades of trainees. However, a shortage of funds for training,
lack of training aids such as equipment and tools, as well as standard curricula
and evaluation methods adversely affects the quality and output of training.
4.10        The analysis of training needs to meet the long-term manpower
2 Water Utilities Data Book, Asian and Pacific Region; ADB, November 1993.



28
requirements of the sector has not yet been made, mainly due to the perceived
view in the Government that decentralization of the training to WSCs is the
correct approach and that the training of operating staff without providing means
for physical improvement of degraded facilities has low value. While the idea has
some merit, it is recognized that a study of human resource development for the
sector, including policies to resolve various related issues such as national
licensing of sector trade categories, salary scales, performance incentives, etc.
should be initiated in the near future.
4.11        Experience suggests that the lead time required for carrying out such
a study would exceed the time required to bring the physical components of the
project on line. Project-related training, therefore, to upgrade skills of most
critical trade categories in shortest time was found the most feasible solution
at this time. Greater regional exposure for managers and specialized training in
commercially oriented systems is also proposed. Along these lines a training
needs assessment has been completed for all WSCs and a training proposal has
being prepared in collaboration with the private water operator Saur
International (SI) (para 3.14).
D. Institutional Issues
4.12        Key institutional issues pertain to facilitating the transition of
the WSCs from subsidized entities operating in a planned environment and
providing a minimum level of social service to commercial companies in a market
economy accountable to owners and consumers and self-financing operations and
capital expansion through user charges. Although, as part of the State Enterprise
Reform, the WSCs are expected to recover all operating and maintenance
expenditures by 2000 and contribute to capital expenditures subsequently, the
organizational structure, operating rules and management style required to
support these changes have been slow to evolve. Thus, the WSCs are quite some
distance from their goals of financial independence and customer orientation.
However, the commitment of the provincial PCs and the motivation of the WSC
management to be ready for the transition to the market economy leaves no doubt
that the changes are achievable.
4.13        The principal  changes needed by the WSCs  relate  to increased
operational autonomy, customer orientation, commercial procedures, financial
planning and the institutionalization of accountability and performance enhancing
incentive systems. Implementation of the changes is modulated by the very real
and immediate need to increase revenues quickly. Increased revenues are required
to appropriately fund operations and maintenance, compensate staff adequately and
service the debt for capital expenditures. Increased revenues are also needed to
eliminate subsidies and gradually transform the WSCs into entities operating on
commercial basis.
4.14        In 1995, the Hanoi PC made a credible commitment to reducing NRW by
entering into a technical assistance contract with SI to implement a customer
management program in one district of Hanoi. The first phase of the contract
would be completed in March 1997. A connections survey and inventory of 4328
customers was completed in September 1996. The survey showed that of the 4328
customers, 845 were unidentified in the WSC records, 114 were illegal, and 632
were not receiving any water. This survey indicates the potential for increasing



29
revenues through commercial customer management.
4.15        A decentralized management model based on fully metered zones
operated with community participation is being progressively implemented in
Haiphong since 1995 with good results. NRW in the improved zones has fallen from
over 60% to below 40%. The entire system will be converted to the new model under
the IDA financed project. The Hanoi WBC has agreed on a NRW reduction program
with the Hanoi PC and is implementing it using a similar approach. Comparable
results have been reported in the pilot zones.
4.16        In parallel to the above, accounting consultants Coopers and Lybrand
conducted an evaluation of the billing and collection procedures and accounts
receivable system of the Hanoi WBC in 1995 and made recommendations for
improvement. Based on the study, a Japanese Grant has been obtained for the
Haiphong WSC to improve billing and collection procedures and the account
receivables system. Coopers and Lybrand was selected for the Haiphong contract
and commenced work in January 1997. Similar work would be initiated in Quang Ninh
and Danang with bilateral assistance. Once the accounting systems are
computerized and fully converted to the new national accounting standards,
corporate planning and financial models are proposed to be introduced to
facilitate planning for capital investment programs.
4.17        In Hanoi and Haiphong, pilot NRW detection and evaluation programs
are included in the technical assistance. Based on the asset inventory and
revaluation completed by all WSCs at the end of 1995, operation and maintenance
guidelines based on standard engineering codes of practice are to be prepared to
ensure appropriate budget allocations for the purpose.
4.18        The above initiatives designed to generate the surplus required to
underpin the sustainability of the physical investments would be complemented by
training needed to manage, operate and maintain the facilities effectively in a
market economy. A training needs assessment has been completed for each WSC and
a proposal for a pilot training and evaluation program for the Hanoi WBC has been
prepared in collaboration with SI. It is proposed that based on the evaluation
of the pilot program, the training center in Hanoi be raised to the level of a
national center for training of staff from other WSCs. Training needs of the WSCs
would be identified and evaluated on an annual basis and financed from bilateral
assistance.
4.19        Measures to increase WSC operational autonomy while making the
companies more accountable to the PCs would be based on the introduction of
annual performance agreements between the PCs and the WSCs. Such agreements have
been introduced in Thailand with Bank assistance as part of public sector reform.
Given the natural monopoly in water distribution and the fact that significant
private sector involvement is not yet possible, this constitutes a feasible
option to improve public sector performance. At present, embryonic agreements
related to reduction of NRW exist in Hanoi and a few other WSCs.
4.20        The introduction of other targets in performance agreements between
the PCs and WSCs would integrate project monitoring and evaluation into the
management incentive system in a dynamic fashion. While it is recognized that the
monetary rewards in terms of bonus payments resulting from such a system may not



30
initially compare favorably to other sources of additional income, the system
would allow the WSCs' performance to be compared on a common basis providing
strong psychological motivation for management to improve company performance.
However, the introduction is intended to be selective, based on a judgement of
when such arrangements would yield positive results without becoming
bureaucratized.
4.21        Management incentives to improve performance via consumer involvement
are proposed to be institutionalized through the introduction of public
performance audits (PPAs) of the WSCs by an independent agency. Public disclosure
of comparative information relevant for users would enable consumer voice and
benchmarking competition to be used as effective tools in improving WSC
performance. PPAs are being introduced in the Philippines with Bank assistance.
4.22        Given the decision to reduce sectoral coordination at the national
government level, the Association of Water Supply Companies (AWSC) is currently
being strengthened to share experiences and best practices among the WSCs. For
example, the Danang WSC management has succeeded in universal metering and in
getting NRW down to 33% while the Haiphong WSC has implemented a system of
community involvement in managing water at the neighborhood level which has
decreased NRW from over 60% to below 40% in rehabilitated wards. This lends
confidence to the expectation that the potential exists to reduce NRW quickly and
relatively inexpensively in all WSCs. A workshop on commercial management of
water supply companies in a market economy has been requested by the AWSC and is
planned for August 1997 in collaboration with EDI.
4.23        Sector dialogue with the Government is continuing on gradual private
sector participation in the operations of the WSCs. Evaluation of the experience
gained during the implementation of the contract between Hanoi WBC and SI and BOT
schemes for bulk water provision would be used to propose suitable modifications
and extensions.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Rate Structure
5.1         Country-wide   water   tariffs   for   residential   customers,   state
organizations and businesses were maintained up to 1986 at the nominal rate of 1
VND/m3. Since then, they have been increased significantly in real terms, following
the Government's decision to charge users instead of covering all costs through
general taxes'.   In the early 1990s, the tasks of supplying water and setting
tariffs were decentralized, and provincial WSCs were created that were expected to
progressively become financially self-sufficient. Since then, the WSCs have
submitted every year tariff proposals, including an analysis of customer
affordability, to the PCs for approval. Currently, most customers are charged on
the basis of metered consumption; non-metered residential customers are charged on
assumed monthly consumption (usually 4 m3 per capita) and industrial-commercial
customers through negotiated contracts.
5.2         From 1990-1995, tariffs in the project cities have increased unevenly.
The average tariff in Quang Ninh is the highest, VND 1,800/m3 in 1995, compared to
VND 1,420/m3 in Hanoi, VND 1,150/m3 in Haiphong and VND 838/m3 in Danang.
Typically, domestic consumers pay 20% less than the average charge per m3, while
commercial consumers pay about 45% above the average.   Each city has several
categories (domestic, commercial and tourist facilities), with separate rates. In
Hanoi and Danang, tariffs include a 10% surcharge for sewerage. About 1,000 public
taps operate in Hanoi, and 650 in Haiphong. These provide free water in low-income
areas, but will be gradually phased out. All four WSCs have received approvals from
respective PCs for increased tariffs in 1996 at or above the rate used in the
financial projections (projections use 1995 as the base year as it is the last full
year for which complete accounts are available) for the IDA financed project.
5.3         A national water tariff policy study financed by the ADB was completed
in March 1996 and its recommendations are presently being reviewed by the
Government. The appraisal mission is in agreement with these recommendations which
also address issues of consumer protection and universal access. They include a
minimum monthly charge (covering 5 m3 for domestic and 10 m3 for non-domestic
customers), a lifeline block2 (varying between 12 and 20 m3/month depending on city
size set at a minimum of 1,500 VND/m3), a progressive tariff with three tariff
bands, and a separate tariff for industrial and commercial customers. The
recommendations also include universal metering, amortization of connection costs
through the monthly tariff and groundwater licensing. At negotiations assurances
were obtained from the Government that necessary actions would be taken through PCs,
including adjustment of water tariffs, to achieve required financial objectives of
Hanoi WBC and Haiphong, Danang and Quang Ninh WSCs.
I For the Hanoi WBC, domestic tariff increased 50 times over the period 1988-1995, starting from 20
VND/m3. During the same period, price of electricity to the company increased 12 times while average company
salary increased 14 times.
2 Specific problem related to apartment blocks equipped with one water meter is taken into consideration.



32
5.4         The study estimates the average incremental financial cost (as a proxy
for long run marginal cost) in Hanoi to be VND 2,867/m3 and concludes, based on an
affordability analysis, that tariffs cannot be raised to this level immediately but
would have to converge to the full cost over a period of more than five years. The
study recommends an average 1997 tariff in Hanoi of VND l,910/m3 which is considered
affordable based on an accepted 4% of household income affordability criterion. The
average tariff implemented in Hanoi in mid-1996 is VND 1,700/m3 which is in line
with the study recommendations.
B. Accounting and Auditing
5.5         The Ministry of Finance (MF) is responsible for issuing guidelines and
standards on the accounting and financial management of state organizations. WSCs
budget requests and reports are submitted through the TUPWS or CD to the PCs. The
finance department of each WSC uses cash-based accounting; it prepares monthly or
quarterly accounts using the recently introduced national standard accounting system
which supports cost-centered analysis of expenditures.   Year-end accounts are
currently audited by the PCs, but MF requires that independent auditors be appointed
in all cities during 1997. These auditors will have to be confirmed to be acceptable
to IDA. The WSCs will maintain the project accounts.
5.6         Hanoi WBC accounts were partly computerized from 1993-1995, and are
organized into internal cost accounting units covering the treatment plants and
distribution enterprises. The program to complete the computerization and transfer
existing accounts to the new system is underway.   The computerized billing and
collection system will be reviewed under the project and upgraded where necessary
to include control accounts.
5.7         Haiphong WSC manually prepared cash-based accounts through to 1995.  In
1996, under a Finnish-funded water supply and sanitation program, accounts are being
computerized and a management accounting and information system introduced to
support institutional development and help the managers effectively run the company.
A new computerized billing and collection and accounts receivable system will be
introduced under the project.
5.8         Quang Ninh WSC uses a manual general ledger system of accounts, with
transactions recorded on a cash basis. The project's technical assistance program
will upgrade the accounting and management information system and transfer manual
accounts to a computerized accrual-based system that uses an internal cost and
profit center analysis. It will begin in 1997 and be completed in 2-3 years.
5.9         Danang WSC's accounts are fully computerized using data base software.
Under the project, a technical assistance program would review the system to ensure
all accounting controls and internal cost accounting units are established, and that
results comply with internationally recognized accounting standards.
5.10        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the annual financial
statements of the Hanoi WBC, Haiphong WSC, Quang Ninh WSC, and Danang WSC would be
audited by firms acceptable to the IDA and submitted to the IDA within nine months
of the close of each fiscal year. The Government would maintain the Statement of
Expenditures and the special accounts for the ITF credit and Danish Trust Fund, and
audit reports which would include separate opinions on these Statements, would be



33
prepared by firms acceptable to the IDA and submitted to the IDA within nine months
of the close of each fiscal year. It was agreed that because current accounting
systems and procedures are not capable of readily producing financial statements in
accordance with internationally accepted standards or principles and the fact that
the statements have not been audited in the past, the first audit reports would be
due by September 1999 and would include audits of the companies' accounts for FY98
and project accounts only for FY97.
C. Billing and Collections
5.11        In Hanoi, the WBC's district water enterprises read meters (25W of
registered connections are metered) and send the results to headquarters.   Monthly
bills are prepared centrally and include a 10% charge for sewerage. In 1995, there
were 128,000 registered customers, but partly due to administrative weaknesses, only
about 90,000 bills were issued each month. Payment is due within one month of the
billing. Accounts receivable at the end of 1995 were equal to 68 days' sales. The
bad debt provision for 1995 was 2% of gross sales, and the same figure was included
in financial projections through 2004.
5.12        About 44% of Haiphong's WSC connections are unmetered. The billing
system is computerized and uses data-base software, but does not include accounting
controls or a ledger.   Customers are given 10 days to pay,  and service is
disconnected after 20 days of non-payment. A Japanese Grant-financed technical
assistance to be implemented by the Haiphong WSC in 1997/1998 will design and
introduce a new computerized accounting software module for the billing, collection
and accounts receivable ledger. The new system will have adequate controls and will
be designed to interface with the general ledger.
5.13        Although over half the connections in Quang Ninh WSC are un-metered,
meter readers visit every connection once a month and manually prepare the bills and
collect the fees based on the meter data or number of occupants. The WSC recognizes
the system is unsatisfactory and needs to computerize the system.   Thus, the
technical assistance under the project will make this issue a priority.
5.14        All of Danang WSC's connections are metered and read every month and
customers are given 20 days to pay their bills. The billing system is computerized,
using data base software, but does not include proper accounting controls.  The
system will be reviewed and upgraded through the technical assistance program
provided under the project.
D. Fixed Assets and Revaluation
5.15        Until early 1995, fixed assets held by WSCs were owned by the PCs and
the depreciation charge was transferred partly or totally to the PCs, depending on
their share of investment funding.   Thus,  the WSCs were not responsible for
financing major replacements or new investments. To ensure that WSCs would self-
finance capital works and meet their debt service obligations, the Government
decided in 1995 to abolish the remittance of depreciation charges.
5.16        WSCs maintain registers for assets used in water operations, including
depreciation, over the estimated life expectancy. All the WSCs updated inventories
of fixed assets as of December 31, 1995, and these valuations have been used to



34
adjust financial projections.   The book value of fixed assets is projected to
increase each year by the annual inflation rate.
E. Past Financial Performance
5.17        The WSCs' recent financial performance in the project cities has been
unsatisfactory. In some, the companies appeared to cover a number of recurrent or
capital costs, but depreciation was considerably understated. Also, maintenance was
inadequate, which meant that true operating costs were not reflected on the income
statements.    Further,  the  PCs had  continually  subsidized  the  WSCs  for new
construction and major repairs, even as the water supply systems deteriorated and
water losses increased.   Since the end of 1994 programs for corrective actions
leading to elimination of subsidies have been introduced in Hanoi and Haiphong and
evidence from Haiphong indicates improving tendencies.

5.19        Future finances. The institutional assistance program under the project
will, among other things, help the WSC reduce NRW levels, expected to drop from 66%
in 1996 to 49% in 2001, and to 46% in 2004. The provincial PC has given its support
for tariff increases of about 12% per annum.  As a result, the WBC's financial
performance should improve, with revenues covering operating and maintenance costs
by 1999, and non-operating costs by 2001. To help finance its immediate and future
investment needs, the company will need to generate at least 3% of its capital
expenditure requirements from internal sources from 1997 onwards, and at least 20%
after 2001. Financial projections for the WBC until 2004 are shown in Annex 9, and
the assumptions are listed in Annex 10.
5.20        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Hanoi WBC will take
all necessary measures, including adjusting the structure or levels of tariffs, to
ensure it recovers its operating costs in full, maintains a debt service ratio of
at least 1.2, and a self-financing ratio of at least 3% beginning in FY98, and 20%
in FY02.
5.21        From 1997-2004, the company,s revenues and operating income are expected
to increase by about 325%, and net income, after interest expenses, from a negative
figure in 1997 to VND 137 billion in 2004, with an average rate of return of 12% on
net fixed assets before interest and taxes.   Net internal cash generation is
expected to increase from VND 7 billion to VND 172 billion over the same period,
even after substantial increases in debt service payments, from VND 0.4 billion in
1997 to VND 44.6 billion in 2004. WBC's current ratio is projected to remain at or
above 2.6, and debt service ratio should not be under 2.4, both of which are
satisfactory.
Haiphong Water Supply Company
5.22        Financial  plan.  Haiphong WSC's  capital  spending  requirements  and
financial plan for the 1997-2001 project period are presented in Table 5.2. The
financial plan, including the Government's equity contribution, was confirmed during
negotiations.
5.23        Future finances. Partly as a result of a Finnish aid program, the
company's financial performance should improve during the project period,
registering profits (before interest and taxes) after 1998. Financial projections
until 2004 are presented in Annex 9, and the assumptions appear in Annex 10.
5.24        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Haiphong's WSC would
take all necessary measures, including adjusting the structure or levels of tariffs,
to ensure it recovers its operating costs in full, maintains a debt service coverage
ratio of at least 1.2, and a self-financing ratio of at least 3t beginning in FY98,
and 20% in FY02.
5.25        From 1997-2004,  the company's revenues are expected to increase by
around 300%, achieving an average rate of return of 10% by 2004. Net internal cash
generation is projected to increase from VND 4 billion in 1997 to VND 35 billion in
2004, despite the company' s need to meet debt service payments beginning in 2002 (as
a result of this project). The WSC's current ratio is expected not to fall below
1.3, and the debt service ratio should not be under 1.2, both of which are adequate.

for 1997-2001 are shown in Table 5.3.  The financial plan, including the equity
contribution  from the Government  and the Provincial  People's  Committee,  was
confirmed during negotiations.
5.27        Future finances.  The company's financial performance is expected to
improve during the projection period with revenues covering operating and
maintenance costs by 1998 and achieving an average rate of return of 7% by 2004.
However, its liquidity is not expected to substantially improve until the benefits
of the project are fully realized through increased water production and sales. To
help finance its immediate and future investment needs, the company will need the
continued financial support from the PC through 2002, with an equity contribution
estimated at VND 45 billion in the implementation period. From 2004 onwards, the
WSC should generate about 9% to 10% of its capital expenditure requirements from
internal sources. Financial projections for the WSC until 2004 are shown in Annex
9, and the assumptions used in preparing these projections are in Annex 10.

5.28        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Quang Ninh WSC would
take all necessary measures including adjusting its structure or levels of tariffs
to maintain for each of its fiscal years a ratio of total expenses to total

FY05.
5.29        An increase in water billed of around 5% annually, coupled with annual
tariff increases of about 10%, are expected to raise the company's revenues by 380%
between 1997-2004. Net internal cash generation is projected to grow from VND 2.6
billion in 1997 to VND 16.7 billion in 2004, and debt service payments are expected
to rise from VND 1.0 billion to VND 28.7 billion. The company's current ratio is
projected to be on the low side, down to 0.6 in 2001 but increasing to 2.0 in 2004;
the debt service ratio will also be low, from 0.6 in 2002 to 1.6 in 2004.

5.31        Future finances. To adequately support the project, the WSC's financial
performance will need to improve through higher sales volumes of about 6% annually
through 2000, and also through higher tariffs. It is projected that the WSC will
achieve an average rate of return of 7% in 2004.   The company will need the
continued financial support from the PC until 2001, with an equity contribution
during the period estimated at VND 45 billion. From 2004 onwards, the WSC should
generate about 10% from internal sources to help finance its future investment
program. Between 1997-2004, the WSC's revenues need to increase over sixfold.
5.32        The WSC's current ratio is projected to be on the low side, down to 0.5
in 2002; debt service ratio will also be low, but should reach 1.4 in 2004. The
company' s financial projections until 2004 are shown in Annex 9, and the assumptions
used are in Annex 10.
5.33        During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Danang WSC would take
all necessary measures, including adjusting the structure or level of its tariffs,
to maintain for each of its fiscal years, a ratio of total expenses to total
operating revenues not higher than 100% beginning in FY98, 85% in FY02, and 65% in
FY05.

G. Financial Rates of Return
5.34        Based on the above financial projections presented in detail in Annex
9 and the assumptions presented in Annex 10, the financial internal rates of return
(FIRR) for the four project components have been calculated. The FIRRs for the
Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang components are 28%, 13%, 8% and 8%,
respectively. The analysis is presented in Annex 12.
5.35         The base year is taken as 1995, the last year for which actual data is
available. Without the project, operating efficiency would deteriorate significantly
due to ageing of already obsolete equipment. While this would be non-linear and
discontinuous, a linear approximation of a half percent real annual increase in
operating costs is used in the analysis to reflect all the impacts of the
deterioration. The 1995 tariff is assumed to remain constant in real terms since
there would be no justification for tariff increases without the project. Even if
tariffs are increased, real revenues are likely to remain unchanged because
consumers would disconnect from the utility and resort to self-provisioning in the
face of deteriorating service. In the "with project" scenario, O&M expenditures,
tariffs and percentage of water billed are assumed to increase as indicated in Annex
10. Efficiency gains that would result from lower per unit electricity consumption
are ignored. The FIRRs are calculated over 20 years and a 50% salvage value is
assumed.
5.36        The FIRRs are dependant on the projected tariff and NRW estimates which
have therefore been forecast conservatively. In Hanoi, for example, average tariff
per m3 is projected to increase from VND 1,420 in 1995 gradually to VND 2,213 in
1999, VND 3,331 in 2002 and VND 4,796 in 2004 yielding a total increase of 238% over
the period 1995-2004. The projected tariff stream is below the affordable tariff
stream recommended for Hanoi by the ADB National Tariff Study and has been agreed
by the Hanoi PC. The proposed tariff increase needs to be seen in reference to a
domestic tariff increase in Hanoi of 4900% during the period 1988-1995 (para 5.1)
5.37        NRW in Hanoi, for example, is projected to decrease from 69% in 1995 to
51% by 1999, 48% by 2002 and 46% by 2004. Given the findings of the customer
management survey conducted in Hanoi by Saur International (para 4.14), the decrease
of NRW in rehabilitated wards in Haiphong from 70% to 30* within three years and an
existing NRW of 33% in Danang, these targets are considered very reasonable.
However, continuing attention would need to be devoted to these parameters because
of the sensitivity of the FIRR to variations in them.
5.38        The sensitivity analysis reported in Annex 12 (Table A 12.5) shows that
the FIRR for the project falls from 16% to 13% if the tariff increase falls 10%
below forecasted values; to 15t if NRW reduction is 10% less than estimated; and to
14.5% if there is a 10% over run in capital costs. The FIRRs are insensitive to
project life and salvage value.
5.39        In standard analysis, the impact of tariff increases and metering on
consumption would need to be considered because of the price elasticity of demand.
However, standard analysis assumes no pent up demand, no change in the quality of
the product and no hidden expenditures asides from the price charged. None of these
assumptions holds in the case of the situation in Vietnam. The national tariff study
confirms that households are consuming less than their desired amount because of



40
supply constraints. Secondly, the water to be provided after the project would be
qualitatively different compared to that available presently both in terms of
quality and service level; willingness to pay for potable water at a higher service
level is greater than existing charges. Thirdly, households are spending to improve
the quality of existing water (through boiling, installing storage tanks and
operating electric pumps) an amount on average at least equal to if not exceeding
the existing monthly bill. Thus, the real cost of water is actually expected to
decrease after the project when the necessity for additional private expenditures
by households is removed. In addition to the above factors, urban incomes have been
rising steadily in Vietnam contributing to increased consumption demand. Given the
above, it is not considered necessary to adjust per capita consumption downwards
because of the projected increase in tariffs.
5.40        In relative terms, the rates of return vary substantially in the four
cities, which can be explained by city-specific conditions. It is highest in Hanoi
because both water production and efficiency increase significantly, it is the only
city with groundwater supply resulting in low production costs, and the customer
base is the largest, which brings high savings to consumers. In Haiphong, while the
project would not produce additional water, efficiency gains would be significant,
while project costs would be low since no new facilities would be built. Both Quang
Ninh and Danang have very low coverage (1995 population coverage in Quang Ninh and
Danang was 16% and 42%, respectively, compared to 82% and 98% in Hanoi and Haiphong)
resulting in higher per unit costs. In Danang, system efficiency (in terms of the
proportion of water that is billed) is already very high and improvement under the
project would be slight. However, project costs are the highest because completely
new intake and treatment facilities need to be constructed.
H. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.41        Performance would be monitored against the implementation schedule
(Annex 4) and the project implementation plan (Annex 5), while the agencies'
operational, financial and managerial performance will be assessed against the
monitoring indicators in Annex 11. The key performance indicators are percentage of
NRW, number of household connections, and the financial working ratio. These relate,
respectively, to the desired project goals of rehabilitating the networks, expanding
coverage, and improving financial performance of the WSCs. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the WSCs would provide IDA on June 30 and December 31
with semi-annual progress reports, including revised project cost estimates,
implementing schedules and monitoring indicators, the first of such reports to be
furnished by June 30, 1998. Annual updated financial projections would be submitted
no later than September 30 of each project year beginning in 1998.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Proiect Benefits
6.1         The proposed project in Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang aims to:
(a) rehabilitate and expand facilities to meet coverage, consumption and quality
targets for the year 2000; (b) improve institutional capacity and operational
efficiency of the WSCs to sustain the physical investments; and (c) prepare an
investment and institutional development program to satisfy system demands after
2000 with maximum self-financing and private sector participation.
6.2         The  project  is  part  of  the  Government's  plan  to  upgrade  all
infrastructure in three key economic regions in order to remove constraints to
industrial development and tourism, to meet demands due to increased urbanization
and rising incomes, to meet environmental standards and to provide access to safe
drinking water. Hanoi, Haiphong and Quang Ninh are part of the northeastern economic
triangle and Danang is the designated growth center in central Vietnam.   Hanoi,
Haiphong and Danang have been identified for priority development as industrial and
commercial centers to absorb foreign direct investment while Danang and Halong City
in Quang Ninh province are designated for development as major tourist attractions.
6.3         Project contributions to development of industrial,  commercial and
tourism potential in the cities would translate into benefits resulting in higher
urban incomes and property values. Better service levels in terms of system
reliability, continuous supply and higher pressure would eliminate household
expenditures on storage tanks and electric motors designed to compensate for poor
service. Improved quality of drinking water which presently does not meet national
standards would eliminate household expenditures incurred on boiling water which is
a necessity in Vietnam. In addition, improved water quality would reduce health
expenditures resulting from the prevalence of water borne diseases. Households
presently without access to piped water would realize time and money savings when
recourse to vendors or wells would be made unnecessary in addition to health
benefits from the availability of potable water. Industrial and commercial
establishments currently pumping groundwater would not need to do so resulting in
environmental benefits.
6.4         Institutional development aimed at commercializing the water companies
would attract private investment in the sector and increase the ability of the
companies to self-finance future capital expenditure. Both outcomes would reduce the
need for public subsidies which could yield higher social benefits in other sectors.
6.5         Without the project, the deterioration of physical assets which have
suffered from prolonged lack of maintenance would accelerate. Equipment life would
be reduced, efficiency would decline, operating costs would increase, the quality
of water would deteriorate, more outages would occur and more consumers would
disconnect from the system, providing water for themselves. Water scarcities would
result given the increasing urban population. The possibility of water riots cannot
be ruled out; such riots directed against the water company occurred in Haiphong in
1993 resulting in the death of a company employee. The Government's infrastructure
package for the key economic regions would remain incomplete and ability of the
cities to attract foreign investment and tourism would be negatively affected.
Construction of facilities for tourists in a number of cities is already on hold

because of water and power shortages.
B. Least-Cost Solution
6.6         The Government's commitment to the project is not explicitly based on
a project rate of return analysis because a number of strategic social, development,
environmental and health objectives cannot be quantified precisely in terms of
benefits. There is no alternative to meeting, at the very least, the minimum
consumption requirements of the urban population, preferably with an acceptable
quality of water. Consequently, the Government's objective is to attain a minimum
defined level of coverage, consumption, service, and water quality by 2000 in the
major urban centers at the least cost. The alternative options evaluated are
detailed in the feasibility studies which are available in the project file. Out of
these, the least cost alternatives have been selected for the project.
C. Rate of Return
6.7         Notwithstanding the above, based on partial quantification of benefits
and costs and conservative assumptions, economic rates of return have been
calculated for the project components. The financial internal rates of return,
reported in para 5.34, are used as the starting point to compute the economic
internal rates of return.
6.8         To convert financial costs to economic costs, taxes and duties have been
eliminated. The relatively free exchange rate implies that there is no significant
foreign exchange premium. The major operating cost is due to electricity, comprising
more than half of total operating costs, which is being charged to the WSCs at the
long run marginal cost of electricity without any distortion. Regarding local wage
costs, it has been determined that market (or financial) wage rates broadly reflect
the opportunity cost of skilled labor in Vietnam taking into account the increasing
shortage of qualified technical staff. Although minimum wage levels may distort wage
rates for unskilled labor somewhat above market levels, the more skilled labor force
which predominates in the WSCs is likely to be virtually unaffected. With respect
to unskilled labor, a shadow wage factor of 0.6 is proposed. However, sensitivity
analysis indicates that the impact is insignificant since labor costs are a small
proportion of total supply costs. The prices of treatment chemicals are reported to
be distorted but again this is a small proportion and is ignored. Rather, the
impacts of labor and chemical cost distortions are captured through sensitivity of
the results to total costs. Net present value is calculated using a real discount
rate of 10%.
6.9         The only benefits quantified for inclusion in the economic analysis
relate to the coping costs consumers would avoid because of the project. Earlier
research has shown that water tariff is not the only cost borne by consumers.
Rather, the inefficiencies of water supply companies are passed on in terms of extra
costs to consumers who attempt to improve their service by installing underground
and overhead storage tanks and operate electric motors to pump water or use backup
devices like handpumps. Also, they incur additional expenses to purify the water



43
by boiling or using filters'. Data from HCM City indicates that households connected
to the water supply system incur additional costs of 300,000 VND per month.
Households without access to the piped system incur even higher costs since the
price of water purchased from vendors exceeds the price of piped water.
6.10        Full benefits of avoided coping costs are unlikely to be realized
immediately since they are dependent on changes in consumer behavior and confidence
in the reliability of the improved service which will build up gradually. In the
"with project" scenario, it is assumed that household avoided costs of 33,000 VND
per month would start being realized in 1999 and would stabilize at 45,000 VND per
month in 2001.
6.11        Benefits resulting from improved health and environment, higher incomes
and property values due to the development impact of improved water service, and
availability of piped water to non-domestic users presently relying on groundwater
are ignored in the analysis. Therefore, the rates of return calculated will be
grossly under-estimated and are only intended to confirm that they are above the
hurdle rate commonly used for water supply projects.
6.12        In the "without project" scenario, the continued system deterioration
would impose increased coping costs on domestic consumers. It is conservatively
assumed that additional monthly coping costs of 2,000 VND would be imposed. These
would increase by 2,000 VND per year stabilizing at a level of 10,000 VND per month
after 5 years. Costs to non-domestic consumers and to the economy resulting from
infrastructure bottlenecks are ignored.
6.13        Resource costs that merit consideration in a water supply project
pertain to the cost of the raw water and environmental costs. In Hanoi, the
groundwater aquifer is recharged from the Red River and is not mined. The reserves
are estimated to be sufficient to meet demand upto 2010. There is no alternative use
of the groundwater and therefore no opportunity cost is attributed. In Quang Ninh
province, water is provided from a dedicated dam with no agricultural use and
involving no opportunity cost. In Haiphong and Danang, surface water is used which
could have alternative employment in agriculture. An opportunity cost of 50 VND/m3
is used based on data available from the National Tariff Study.
6.14        Environmental costs pertain to the cost of disposing the wastewater
generated. However, in the proposed project, net additional water is not being
produced. First, capacity expansion is limited. Second, the additional pped water
produced by the WSCs would provide access to presently non-connected households.
These households are presently using water from alternative sources which would be
substituted by the piped water. Given that the project aims to provide 80% coverage
at minimum consumption levels, the entire impact would be one of substitution,
displacing non-piped sources. Therefore environmental costs are not imputed to the
project.
6.15        Based  on  the  above  set  of  conservative  assumptions  and  partial
1 The 1992 World Development Report, pp. 98-99, estimates that in Jakarta, Indonesia, households spend
an amount equal to one percent of the city's gross domestic product, US$50 million, only on boiling water.



44
quantification of benefits and costs, the estimates of the economic internal rates
of return (EIRR) for the four project components and the overall project are as
follows: Hanoi, 19%; Haiphong, 24%; Quang Ninh, 12%; Danang, 11%; and the overall
project, 17%. All rates exceed the commonly used hurdle rate of 10t and confirm that
the project as a whole and each component individually is economically justified.
6.16        Actual rates of return based on inclusion of all benefits are likely to
be an order of magnitude higher than those computed and therefore quite robust
against typical variations in costs and benefits. Benefits, in terms of avoided
costs, have been estimated very conservatively. However, we can test project
sensitivity to a further 10% decrease in benefits. Typical cost overruns are not
expected to exceed lot of capital and O&M costs. Capital costs are designed to be
controlled because of procurement through single supply and install contracts in
each city. O&M costs have a lot of slack built in them because existing costs are
not adjusted for efficiencies resulting from reduced electricity consumption because
of replacement of ageing and obsolete equipment and from reduction in staff levels
as the WSCs are commercialized.
6.17        Sensitivity analysis shows that the overall project rate of return falls
from 17% to 12% for the worst case, where benefits decrease by 10% and both capital
and O&M costs increase by 10%. For 10% percent variations from the base case, the
rate of return is most sensitive to benefit reduction (falling to 14%), less
sensitive to capital cost increases (falling to 15%) and least sensitive to an
increase in O&M costs (falling to 16%). In no situation does the project EIRR fall
below acceptable levels. Annex 12 presents the assumptions made in calculating the
economic rates of return, the data used and the results including the sensitivity
analysis.
6.18        An alternative approach to quantifying project benefits would be to use
estimates of consumer willingness to pay per m3 of improved water. Studies in other
countries have consistently found that average willingness-to-pay for better service
exceeds the existing tariff charged. According to the survey carried out for the
National Water Tariff Policy Study (para 5.3), this is also true in Vietnam, where
the provision of water has been considered a social obligation and tariffs have been
considerably subsidized. However, methodologically acceptable estimates of consumer
willingness to pay for improved water are not available for the cities covered by
the proposed project.
D. Affordability
6.19        Because of the avoided coping costs detailed above, the total price of
household water consumption is expected to fall after the project is implemented.
However, affordability analyses available for most developing countries exclude
coping costs and examine only the burden resulting from the price of piped water.
Surveys conducted for the National Water Tariff Policy Study show that existing
tariffs are affordable and that higher tariffs proposed by the Study could be
charged in 1995 without exceeding 4 percent of household income for ordinary and
"lifeline" domestic consumers. The 4 percent rule is commonly used as a measure of
affordability for water supply.
6.20        Hanoi was the only city covered by the Study which is also included in
the proposed project. Average monthly incomes for all households and those in the



45
lowest quintile were estimated at 1,200,000 VND and 650,000 VND, respectively, while
the corresponding expenditures for water were 19,500 VND and 11,300 VND.  These
expenditures translate into 1.6% and 1.5% of household income, well below the 4%
threshold.   The percentages were 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively in Thanh Hoa, the
smallest and poorest urban center included in the survey.
6.21        Based on the results and affordability analysis,  the Tariff Study
proposed an average tariff for Hanoi of 3560 VND per cubic meter in 2000 (the
average tariff in 1995 was 1420 VND) . By comparison, the financial projections for
the proposed IDA project are based on a tariff of 2478 VND in the same year. Thus,
the tariffs agreed to by the provincial governments are within the commonly accepted
affordability threshold. Reduction of coping costs would further decrease the total
costs presently being borne by households in the project cities.
E. Project Risks
6.22        Since the physical components  of the project deal primarily with
rehabilitating existing facilities, there are no unusual risks.  No irreversible
environmental impacts are expected and the protection of water sources and options
for disposal of treatment sludge (identified during project preparation) will be
addressed through special studies during implementation.
6.23        The engineering preparation was guided by the need to reduce land
acquisition and resettlement as much as possible. Thus, the project will require
only limited land acquisition, relocation of population and demolition of houses
because most of the treatment plants, intakes and wellfields are located away from
residential areas.
6.24        A major risk to the project could stem from inadequate maintenance of
the rehabilitated facilities. Therefore, as part of project preparation, the water
companies have conducted an asset inventory which is being used to produce
maintenance guidelines based on standard engineering codes of practice. These
guidelines would be used to ensure adequate budgetary allocation for prevention and
maintenance.
6.25        Another risk to project sustainability could arise from inadequate
incentives to improve financial and managerial performance. Therefore, the project
proposes a number of institutional development measures to be undertaken before and
during project implementation. These include training field and office personnel,
improving the billing, collection and customer management systems, introducing
performance contracts between the provincial governments and the water supply
companies, and public performance audits of all water supply companies by an
independent agency. Collaboration with a reputable international water systems
operator and with EDI has been initiated to assist with some of these tasks which
are considered critical success factors for the project.
6.26        Shortage of counterpart funds and coordination of activities funded by
different donors could slow project implementation. Financial plans indicating the
level of funding required from the provincial governments have been discussed and
agreed with the PCs and have been made part of the terms under which project
components have been approved by the Office of Government. Coordination problems are
mitigated by substantial assistance from the Resident Mission.

water tariffs, to achieve required financial objectives of Hanoi WBC and Haiphong,
Danang and Quang Ninh WSCs (para 5.3); and
d.    The Government would maintain the Statement of Expenditures and the
special accounts for the ITF credit, and audit reports, which would include separate
opinions on these Statements, would be prepared by firms acceptable to the IDA and
submitted to the IDA within nine months of the close of each fiscal year (para
5.10)-
7.2         At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the WSCs that:
a.    The WSCs would submit each year, beginning October 30, 1997, annual
plans for institutional assistance and training to IDA for review (para 3.23);
b.    The WSCs would implement their respective RAPs and would arrange for:
(i) semiannual progress reports on WSCs' supervision and monitoring of resettlement
activities; (ii) starting from December 31, 1997, an independent annual monitoring
of RAPs' implementation; and (iii) final report on completion of each RAP (para
3.28) . IDA approval of a detailed (distribution) RAP in respect of each network
site would be required prior to commencement of works on that part of the project.
These would be prepared by WSCs and approved by PCs (para 3.28);
c.    The  Quang Ninh WSC  would  furnish by December  31,  1997  proposed
arrangements for periodic inspections of the Cao Van dam and that it would implement
recommendations of such inspections thereafter (para 3.33);
d.    The annual financial statements of the Hanoi WBC, Haiphong WSC, Quang
Ninh WSC, and Danang WSC would be audited by firms acceptable to the IDA and
submitted to the IDA within nine months of the close of each fiscal year. The first
audit reports would be due by September 1999 and would include audits of the
companies' accounts for FY98 and project accounts only for FY97. (para 5.10);
e.    Hanoi  and  Haiphong  WSCs  would  take  necessary  measures  including
adjusting the structure or level of tariffs, to ensure they recover operating costs
in full as well as maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2, and a
self-financing ratio of at least 3W beginning FY98, and 20% in FY02 (paras 5.20 and
5.24);
f.    Quang Ninh and Danang WSCs would take necessary measures including
adjusting the structure or level of tariffs, to maintain for each of their fiscal



47
years a ratio of total expenses to total operating revenues not higher than 100t in
FY98, 85% beginning in FY02, and 65% in FY05 (paras 5.28 and 5.33); and
h.    The WSCs would provide IDA with semiannual progress reports including
revised project cost estimates, implementing schedules and monitoring indicators on
June 30 and December 31 each year, the first of such reports to be furnished by June
30, 1998. Annual updated financial projections would be submitted no later than
September 30 of each project year, beginning in 1998 (para 5.41).
7.3         At negotiations, the Government and WSCs confirmed (a) onlending terms
(para 3.20); (b) adherence to implementation action plans (para 3.24); (c) adherence
to environmental management plans  (para 3.49);  (d)  adherence  to action plan
regarding obligations pertaining to households resettled from the Cao Van dam (para
3.30); (e) the content of periodical reports (para 3.52); and (f) their financial
plans (paras 5.18, 5.22, 5.26, 5.30).
7.4         The execution of Australian, Danish and Finnish Grant Agreements and
Danish Trust Fund (para 3.20) and the establishment of Resettlement Committees by
each of the PCs (para 3.28) are conditions of effectiveness.
7.5         Execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and Hanoi
WBC, and Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang WSCs (para 3.20), and employment of
construction management consultants acceptable to IDA is a condition of disbursement
of funds related to that part of the project (para 3.22). Full disbursement of the
proceeds of the Danish Trust Fund is a condition of disbursement of the ITF credit
earmarked for the respective project component (para 3.40). Compliance with the
obligation to provide some additional assets (land and electrical connections) to
households resettled in Gia Lai province is a condition of disbursement of the
proceeds of the credit earmarked to finance all of Quang Ninh WSC project components
(para 3.30).
7.6         Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for an ITF credit of SDR 71.3 million (US$98.6 million
equivalent) , for a period of 40 years, including a grace period of ten years, at IDA
standard terms. The borrower would be the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

VIETNAM
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Existing water supply, sewerage and solid waste services
HANOI COMPONENT
Population
1.    Hanoi, the country's capital, is Vietnam's second largest city, one of four
with provincial status. It is situated in the low-income and less developed
northern part of Vietnam, in the Red River delta some 100 km from the sea and
Haiphong port. In 1994 it accounted for about 6% of the country's GNP mainly made
up of services such as government, commerce, banking and education but also
manufacturing and agriculture. Nearly 900,000 are employed; 30% in services and
the remainder equally distributed between manufacturing and agriculture.
2.    The city is divided into four urban districts (quan) namely Ba Dinh, Hoan
Kiem, Dong Da and Hai Ba Trung, and five sub-urban districts ( Tu Liem, Gia Lam,
Than Tri, Dong Anh and Me Linh). The districts are divided into wards (phuong)
each containing 10,000-15,000 population. Since the city has provincial status
its Peoples' Committee reports directly to the national government and the
structure of the city government generally reflects that of the national
government. Typical organization of provincial government is shown in Chart 2.
3.    Hanoi's population has grown from 1.8 million in 1985 to about 2.2 million
in 1995, and is expected to increase to 2.5 million in 2005. The administrative
area of Hanoi city is 925 km2, of which about 883 km2 form a rural belt of five
suburban districts surrounding the developed urban center of about 42 km2. The
population of the four urban districts has grown from 0.8 million in 1985 to 1.1
million in 1995 and is expected to grow to 1.2 million in 2005. Population
density in urban Hanoi varies from about 80 persons per hectare (p/ha) to 1,400
p/ha with the most densely populated parts of the city in the old center (Hoan
Kiem district) and some parts of neighboring Hai Ba Trung and Dong Da districts.
4.    Urban land use master plan of 1993 proposed that by 2010 about 110 ha of
land currently used by agriculture be urbanized. Industrial areas are planned to
be relocated in suburban fringe downstream of the city where large area of land
will be prepared. Small scale industries will still remain in the urban area.
Water supply
5.    The water supply services are managed by Hanoi Water Business Company
(WBC),  a provincial business enterprise1,  reporting to the city's People's
' A business enterprise performs an economic activity and generates revenues from its sales. It is expected
to be financially self-supporting and legally independent.



49                     ANNEX  1
Committee through its Transport and Urban Public Works Service (TUPWS). In the
current form, WBC was established in April 1994 through merging the earlier water
company, the water investment company and the training center. WBC staff of about
1,660 is divided into four functional groupings: (a) production, headed by the
deputy director, with the responsibility for water production in the eight water
plants, the electro-mechanical enterprise and the transport enterprise; (b)
distribution, headed by the deputy director, with the responsibility for water
distribution through six water business enterprises, the meter reading, billing,
collection and installation enterprise, and materials enterprise, which provides
stores support for the entire company; (c) services departments, which include
departments for planning, finance, organization and training, and legal, all
reporting directly to the general director and (d) construction.
6.    The production and distribution capacity of the WBC piped system in 1995
was 353,000 m3/d and the daily average production was 320,000 m3/d, including
about 69% of non-revenue water. Water services were provided to about 900,000
consisting of about 800,000 of the population in the four urban districts and
100,000 living in neighboring suburban districts through 123,000 connections and
about 1,000 public standposts. Out of total service connections, about 96% were
residential, using about 18% of water supplied; 49 were commercial, institutional
and industrial, using 13%; remaining 69 t was non-revenue water. Private wells,
both deep and shallow, are estimated to provide about 140,000 m3/d in addition
to WBC production, servicing additional about 110,000 people, commerce and
industry in WBC supply area.    The projected daily average water demand and
production capacity assuming 25% of NRW are shown in Table A-1.1.

7.    The water source is groundwater extracted by wells from alluvial deposits
along the Red River. The raw water has a high content of iron and manganese and
is treated prior to distribution. The waterworks facilities include 130 wells
65-70 m deep with diameters of 600 mm, clustered in 13 wellfields, eight



50                     ANNEX  1
treatment plants of sizes varying from 18,000 m3/d to 60,000 m3/d, nine balancing
reservoirs with the total volume of 11,200 m3, eight treated water pump stations
with the total capacity of 9,900 m3/hour (240,000 m3/d) and about 400 km of mains
with diameters varying from 60 mm to 600 mm. The tertiary distribution network
is practically non-existent.
8.    During last ten years the WBC system has been rehabilitated with help from
Finnish government. These works, expected to be completed in early 1997, include
improvement of production and distribution facilities. All the rehabilitated
treatment plants work satisfactorily and completed parts of the network display
substantial improvement in the water pressure, however, parts of the old town
with population of about 170,000 still experience very low pressure and
intermittent service and remain to be rehabilitated. Since Hanoi solely depends
on groundwater the ever growing extractions by the WBC and private wells resulted
in some areas in land subsidence, reaching 5-10 mm per annum.
Sewerage and drainaqe
9.    Sewerage and drainage services are managed by the Hanoi Sanitation and
Drainage Company (SDC), an administrative enterprise2, reporting to city's PC
through its TUPWS. In 1995 SDC maintained 120 km of sewers and 35 km of open
channels operating as combined sewerage system. The system serves about 30% of
the urban area, is overloaded and in poor state of repair; it discharges into
city's lakes and rivers without treatment and level of maintenance and cleaning
is low. TUPWS, assisted by the Government of Japan, is preparing improvement and
expansion of the system with construction planned to start in 1998.
Nightsoil and septage disposal
10.   It is estimated that Hanoi population generates about 40 t/d of nightsoil
from bucket collection, 60 t/d is stored in pit and vault latrines and 150 t/d
is disposed of in septic tanks. Of this quantity about 60-70 t/d of nightsoil and
septage from pits, vaults and septic tanks is collected and disposed of at Me Tri
landfill. The remaining is used by farmers.
Solid waste management
11.   The  solid  waste  services  are  managed  by  URENCO,  an  administrative
enterprise, reporting to PC through its TUPWS. In 1995 URENCO has collected daily
about 300 ton of solid waste and disposed it of at the Me Tri landfill about 8
km west from the city center. Only about 35%-40% of total generated solid waste
estimated at 1,000 t/d is collected. The rest is burned or buried at source or
scattered. The landfill has reached the end of its life and is being closed. A
new site at Tham Hiep with an area of about 20 ha and with expected life of 5
years has been selected and the construction started in 1996.
2 An administrative enterprise renders public service to the community. It is almost entirely funded from
public sources, normally from the budget of the local government by which it is licensed.

HAIPHONG COMPONENT
Population
12.   Haiphong is Vietnam's fourth largest city, one of the four with provincial
status. It is situated in the less developed northern part of Vietnam, on the
right bank of the Red River delta in the Gulf of Tonkin. The major economic
activities include the port which is the biggest in Vietnam, the shipyard and
cement factory. Nearly 600,000 are employed; 30% in services and the remainder
equally distributed between manufacturing and agriculture.
13.   The city is divided in three urban districts (Hong Bang, Le Chan and Ngo
Quyen), and seven rural districts (Thuy Nguyen, An Hai, An Lao, Kien Thuy, Tien
Lang, Vin Bao and the island district Cat Hai). The semi-urban neighborhoods are
being developed in the south of the urban districts around towns Kien An and Do
So, about 8 km and 15 km distant, respectively. These are planned to be upgraded
to urban districts in the near future. Since the city has provincial status its
Peoples' Committee reports directly to the national government and the structure
of the city government generally reflects that of the national government.
14.   Haiphong's population of 1.6 million in 1993 is expected to grow to about
1.8 million in 2000, and to 2.2 million in 2010. The administrative area of
Haiphong city is 1,500 km2, of which about 1,480 km2 form a circle of islands and
rural districts around the developed urban center with and area of 20 km2,
planned to increase to 27 km2 and 37 km2 in 2000 and 2010. The 1993 population
in the three urban districts of 400,000 is expected to grow to 450,000 and
550,000 in 2000 and 2010. The 1993 population of Kien An and Do So towns of
88,000 is expected to grow to 100,000 and 120,000 in 2000 and 2010.
Water supply
15.   Water supply services are managed by Haiphong Water Supply Company (WSC),
a business enterprise, reporting to the city's PC through TUPWS. Haiphong WSC
service area includes three urban districts, Kien An and Do Son towns. Its staff
of 620 is divided into four functional groupings: (a) production, laboratory and
workshop, headed by the deputy director; (b) consumer services, distribution and
booster stations, also headed by the deputy director; (c) services departments,
which include planning, materials, personnel, accounting and administration all
reporting directly to the General Director; and (d) construction.
16.   The production and distribution capacity of the water supply system and the
daily average production in 1995 was 125,000 m3/d or 300 lcd, including about 69%
of non-revenue water. Water services were provided to commerce, institutions,
industry and 420,000 or 98% of urban population through 31,000 metered and 25,000
unmetered connections.   Out of 56,000 service connections,  about 97% were
residential, using about 24% of water supplied; 3% were commercial, institutional
and industrial, using 7% of water; remaining 69% was non-revenue water.  The
projected daily average water demand and production capacity assuming 25% of NRW
are shown in Table A-1.2.

17.   The source is surface water treated in five treatment plants. All plants
are supplied from tidal regulated rivers fed by Thai Binh River system flowing
to Haiphong from northwest. The raw water has occasionally high turbidity and
shows low levels of organic pollution. The waterworks facilities include five
intakes, several kilometers of raw water transmission canals and mains, five
treatment plants of sizes varying from 5,000 m3/d to 60,000 m3/d, six balancing
reservoirs with the total volume of 3,050 m3, five treated water pump stations
with the total capacity of 4,100 m3/hour (95,000 m3/d) and about 160 km of
transmission mains with diameters varying from 150 mm to 600 mm. Most
transmission mains are made of cast iron and galvanized steel. The tertiary
distribution network is practically non-existent. The majority of mains have
never been pressurized over one bar, external and internal corrosion is common,
and joints and fittings are leaking, generally beyond repair.
18.   The WSC system is rehabilitated with help from Finnish government. The
works  include  improvement  of production  and distribution  facilities.  The
reduction of non-revenue water has been implemented from 1994 by constructing new
"phuong distribution systems". Phuong system normally has no more than three
connections to secondary network and all houses are provided with metered
connections. The experiment started nearest to An Duong treatment plant and by
December 1995 nine phuongs with 50, 000 population were rehabilitated and provided
with 11,000 connections. Completed parts of the network display substantial
improvement in the water pressure. The majority of the town which remains to be
rehabilitated experience very low pressure and intermittent service.
Sewerage and drainage
19.   Sewerage and drainage services in the three urban districts are managed by
the Haiphong Sewerage and Drainage Company (SDC) an administrative enterprise
reporting to PC through TUPWS. Other towns, such as Kien An and Do Son, have



53                     ANNEX  1
their own organizations for environmental services. Urban Haiphong is served by
170 km of combined sewers conveying stormwater and wastewater. The network
consists of open ditches, close conduits and several major box sewers. Due to its
age and absence of maintenance the network is in a poor state of repair. Besides
on-site treatment, such as septic tanks or some basic facilities in industrial
establishments, no treatment of wastewater exists. Household sanitation is very
basic. The 1989 census showed that about 11,000 (46%) of urban household have no
latrine of their own, often shared with neighboring households. Remaining 54% of
households used 420 public latrines or resort to any other open place.
Nichtsoil and septage disposal
20.   About 35 t/d of nightsoil was collected in 1995 in urban Haiphong. In
addition, about 100 t/d is used for small individual gardening. Septage from
about 5,500 septic tanks and the nightsoil is either sold to farmers or disposed
of in the landfill and also in the nearest sewer or lake. The septage and
nightsoil are applied to agricultural land and fishpond with no preliminary
treatment or conditioning.
Solid waste management
21.   The solid waste services are managed by Haiphong URENCO, an administrative
enterprise established in 1964, reporting to PC through its TUPWS. In addition
to solid waste URENCO also manages collection and disposal of septage, nightsoil
and solid waste, cleans streets and operates public latrines. Daily generation
of solid waste was estimated in 1995 at 320 t/d, of which 250 t/d (440 m3/d) were
collected by URENCO and 70 t/d was left in the service area, mainly in the back
street and open spaces which are littered with garbage. A considerable portion
of waste is organic, recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, metal and glass
are normally scavenged before collection. The collected waste is disposed of in
a landfill dump at Thuong Ly (in Hong Bang district). Of the total area of 10 ha
about 7 ha have been filled up to elevation of 4.0 m above sea level.
OUANG NINH COMPONENT
Population
22.   The component includes Halong City and Cam Pha town, situated along the
scenic coast in the Quang Ninh province in the Northern Mountains Region of
Vietnam. With 1994 population of nearly 900,000 and an area of 5,900 km2 Quang
Ninh is of a medium size among Vietnam's 53 provinces. The province as well as
the component area are characterized by steep hills with residential locations
on the low-lands between. The components' 1994 total population was 278,000
living in 62,000 households.
23.   Halong City, the capital of the province, acquired city status in 1994
through merging the towns Hong Gai and Bai Chay, each located on one bank of the
Dien Vong River estuary. The industries and the administration are mostly in the
eastern part, Hong Gai, while tourist hotels are in the western part, Bai Chay.
The 1993 Master Plan projects the City population to grow from the current



54                     ANNEX  1
124,000 to 510,000 in 2010, mainly through absorbing neighboring districts
including Cam Pha, and its area to grow from 124 ha to 340 ha in 2010. Cam Pha
town, with 1994 population of 132,000, is a district capital 20 km east of Halong
City along the coastal road to the Chinese border 70 km distant. The district is
dominantly rural with most of the population concentrated around Cam Pha town.
24.   With about 95% of country's anthracite reserves in the province Halong City
and Cam Pha town developed into the nations' largest center of coal mining and
processing. Other industrial activities include shipbuilding, cement production,
fisheries and seafood processing. Shipping is to be greatly increased through a
new port for general cargo currently being developed in Dien Vong River estuary
while the coal port is being moved in Cam Pha. The total labor force was
estimated in 1994 at 115,000 of which more that 60% were employed in mining and
manufacturing and the rest in services and administration.
Water supply
25.   Water supply services are managed by the Quang Ninh Water Supply Company
(WSC), a provincial business enterprise, reporting to the Provincial PC through
its Construction Bureau. It was established in 1976 and re-registered in 1992.
WSC has 475 permanent employees headed by the Director assisted by two Vice-
Directors in charge of the Administration Department and the Technical
Department. Operations of the Water Company are decentralized into six water
supply enterprises3 and one mechanical workshop unit. Each enterprise is headed
by a director reporting to the Director of the Company and normally include an
administration department and several technical teams such as for operating
treatment plant, pumping stations or distribution network for water supply
enterprises or for a typical specialization in the workshop unit.
26.   The 1995 production and distribution capacity of the four water supply
enterprises included in the component was 51,600 m3/d and the daily average
production was 28,000 m3/d or 650 lcd, including about 56% of non-revenue water.
Water services were provided through 13,000 connections to commerce, industry and
43,200 population (15% of total) of which 9,500 were in Bai Chay, 28,200 in Hong
Gai and 5,500 in Cam Pha. About 97 e of all connections were residential, using
about 17% of water supplied and 3 % were commercial and industrial using 27% of
water supplied. Remaining 56% was non-revenue water.   Private shallow wells,
estimated to provide about 12,000 m3/d in addition to public supply, are polluted
and should be considered a temporary source. The projected daily average water
demand and production capacity assuming 25% of NRW are shown in Table A-1.3.
27.   The water originates from surface and ground sources. The surface source
serving Bai Chay is Dong Ho River; an intake and Dong Ho treatment plant with a
capacity of 20,000 m3/d are 10 km from Bai Chay. The source serving Hong Gai/Cam
Pha is Dien Vong River; an intake and Dien Vong treatment plant, with a capacity
3 Water enterprises are: Bai Chai, Hong Gai, Cam Pha, and Dien Vong treatment plant; last two, Uong Bi
and Mao Khe, are not included in the component.



55                     ANNEX  1
of 15,00 m3/d are about 20 km from Hong Gai. In both instances the facilities
include intakes formed by a weir across the river, raw water pumping and rising
main, treatment plant, treated water pumping and rising main. The ground water
is pumped from thirteen deep wells providing about 1,600 m3/d and 15,000 m3/d to
Bai Chay and Hong Gai/Cam Pha, respectively. The distribution network consists
of eighteen balancing reservoirs with the total volume of 22,300 m3, several
boosting pumping stations, and about 125 km of mains with diameters varying from
100-800 mm. The tertiary distribution network is practically non-existent. Its
functions have been replaced by extremely long individual connections (spaghetti
connections) which draw water directly from mains.

bl To be determined in later studies
28.   The water supply works and equipment are in poor state of repair due to low
quality of materials used for construction, poor initial construction, and many-
years absence of maintenance. The quality of water supplied is unsatisfactory as
a result of inadequate treatment and lack of disinfection. Also, supply is
intermittent, for several hours per day or even for some days during the week.
29.   A new source of water for Dien Vong treatment plant will be the recently
completed Cao Van dam about 4.5 km upstream from Dien Vong treatment plant.  The
dam has been designed to be constructed in two phases of 60,000 m3/d each. The
dam design and quality of construction have been inspected by an expert in June
1995; he will continue such inspections annually for the next three years. First
inspection report is available in the project file.
Sewerage and drainage
30.   Sewerage and drainage services in the component area are managed by the
Halong City Environment and Sanitation Company (ESC) and Cam Pha Town Sanitation
Company (SC), both administrative enterprises reporting to the city and town
People's Committee, respectively, through their Urban Departments. In addition



56                     ANNEX  1
to sewerage and drainage, the companies manage street cleaning, solid waste
collection and disposal, maintain public toilets, cemeteries, public parks and
street lights. To supplement their resources they also undertake minor
construction works and develop and operate rental housing. The companies are
headed by a Director assisted by two Vice Directors, one in charge of sanitation
and environment and the other in charge of construction, including operation of
rental housing, and maintenance of street lights. In 1995 the Halong and Cam Pha
companies had 190 and 170 employees, respectively.
31.   In 1995, about 82% of households had their own latrine and 10% used public
latrines while 8% had no access to toilet facilities. There is a shift towards
construction of pour flush latrines with septic tanks; it can be expected that
a great number of other types will be converted in very near future.
32.   Halong and Cam Pha are served by about 53 km of combined sewers.  It
consists of open channels with minor length of pipework, designed as storm water
drainage. The channels are normally short and discharge directly in the Halong
Bay. Due to lack of maintenance a number of channels are completely blocked with
solid waste, sand and gravel, some of the channel outlets and some length of
pipework have collapsed, all resulting in surface flow or flooding even during
average storms. In addition, during low tides the normally submerged drainage
outfalls are exposed with untreated wastewater flowing slowly on mud flats from
where various sea food for domestic consumption Ls collected.
Nightsoil and septage disposal
33.   The latrines' pits and vaults are typically made smaller than recommended
and need emptying about four times per year. The septic tanks were constructed
largely during last two years and have not yet been cleaned. The emptying of pits
and vaults is normally done by farmers free of charge. On request it is also
pumped out by the Sanitation Companies which also service public toilets. Sullage
is typically disposed of directly into drainage channels or into septic tanks.
Solid waste management
34.   The solid waste services are managed by the Halong and Cam Pha Environment
and Sanitation Companies. Daily generation of solid waste in both communities is
estimated at about 150 t/d (375 m3/d) with a considerable part being organic,
while recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, metal and glass form a very
small part. The solid waste collected from households, hospitals and industries
is disposed of at two waste dumps serving the Halong City and the Cam Pha town.
Inappropriate disposal of solid waste causes malfunctioning of the drainage
system, generates breeding of insects and rodents, leads to general environmental
degradation of the communities and contributes to pollution of Halong Bay.
DANANG COMPONENT
Population
35.   The third largest city in Vietnam and one of the four with provincial



57                     ANNEX  1
status, Danang city is situated on the coast in central Vietnam about midway
between Hanoi and HCMC. It has a major deep water sea port and good access to
communication network through the National Highway #1 and Trans Vietnam railway.
About 52% of population is working primarily in manufacturing, such as textile,
and consumption goods, and services sectors such as commerce, transportation,
tourism and government. A considerable proportion of the labor force, though, is
in temporary or part-time employment. The city's master plan proposes development
of tourist resorts along the coast, commercial centers and industrial export
zones which in aggregate would contribute to increase of current city's GDP from
US$380 per capita to US$760 per capita in 2000. Beside receiving substantial
share of the national investment in improving infrastructure, the master plan
assumes a steady flow of private capital in industry and tourism.
36.   The city is divided into three districts and further subdivided in 28
wards. It covers an area of 43,200 ha, excluding the airport and Son Tra
Mountain. The airport is zoned for national defence purposes and Son Tra Mountain
with its steep slopes is not suitable for urban development; both are, therefore,
excluded from the area under control of the city administration. Sector-wise, the
city administration controls drainage and waste management while water supply is
controlled by the provincial government.
37.   The Danang city population of 450,000 in 1995 is expected to grow to about
500,000 in 2000 due to natural increase and migration. It is planned that after
2000 the city administrative area will about double and include about eight
neighboring communes; aggregate population is projected to reach about 680,000
in 2005 and 765,000 in 2010. The average household of 5.9 persons in 1995 is
planned to reduce to less than 5 after 2005.
Water supply
38.   Water supply services are managed by the Danang Water Supply Company (WSC),
a provincial business enterprise, reporting to the Provincial PC through its
Construction Bureau. It has 230 permanent employees headed by the Director and
assisted by a Chief Accountant and a Vice-Director in charge of the
Administration Department and the Technical Department, respectively
39.   The 1995 production and distribution capacity of the WSC system was 40,000
m3/d and the daily average production was 52,000 m3/d or 270 lcd, including about
33% of non-revenue water. Water services were provided through 21, 000 connections
to commerce, industry and 191,000 population (47% of total). About 93% of all
connections were residential, using about 54% of water supplied and 7% were
commercial and industrial using 13%. Remaining 33% was non-revenue water.
Private shallow wells, providing about 12,500 m3/d and serving 40% of population,
are inadequate and polluted and should be considered a temporary source. The
projected daily average water demand and production capacity assuming 25% of NRW
are shown in Table A-1.4.
40.   The principal water source for Danang is the Cau Do River.  Two separate
intakes on that river, located about 10 km south of the city center provide raw
water for treatment plants at Cam Le adjacent to the intakes and San Bay near the



58                     ANNEX  1
airport. Minor supplies are taken from streams on Son Tra peninsula and treated
in Son Tra two treatment plants.  Cam Le and San Bay plants use conventional
treatment technology and have capacity of 20,000 m3/d each. Son Tra plants with
a combined capacity of 5,000 m3/d use only filtration and chlorination and
provide supply in the Son Tra peninsula only. The distribution network consists
of a number of smaller reservoirs with the total volume of 15,000 m3, several
boosting pumping stations, and about 130 km of mains with diameters varying from
100-900 mm. The tertiary distribution network is practically non-existent. Its
functions have been replaced by extremely long individual connections (spaghetti
connections) which draw water directly from mains.

Sewerage and drainaqe
41.   Sewerage  and  drainage  services  are  managed  by  the  Danang  Urban
Environmental Company (URENCO), an administrative enterprise, reporting to the
city's PC through its Construction Bureau. In 1995 URENCO maintained 37 km of
sewers which operated as combined sewerage system for stormwater and wastewater.
The system, which serves only about 30% of the urban area, is overloaded and in
poor state of repair; it discharges into city's lakes and rivers without any
treatment and the level of maintenance and cleaning is low. The Construction
Bureau is preparing improvement and expansion of the system.
42.   In 1995, about 87% of households in the area had their own latrine and the
remainder had no toilet facilities. There is an observed shift towards
construction of pour flush latrines with septic tanks and it can be expected that
a great number of pit latrines will be converted in very near future.
Nightsoil and septage disposal
43.   It is estimated that Danang population generates daily about 10,000 t of



59                    ANNEX  1
septage. Of this quantity, the Danang URENCO and private contractors collect
about 150 t/d and dispose it at Dai La landfill. The remaining is used as
fertilizer by owners or collected free of charge by farmers.
Solid waste management
44.   The solid waste services and street sweeping are also managed by URENCO.
In 1995 about 350 ton of solid waste of about 450 ton generated was collected and
disposed of daily at the Dai La open dump. The rest is burned or buried at source
or scattered illegally. In addition, URENCO sweeps about 57 km of streets.

structure will be of reinforced concrete in wingwall configuration with an apron
at the same level as the river bed. It will be constructed for the ultimate
capacity of 240,000 m3/d and the installed capacity of 120,000 m3/d. From the
intake raw water will be pumped into the treatment plant through a transmission
main (1.0 km, diameter 1100 mm, pumping head 40 m) provided with a surge
protection.6
Treatment plant
43.   A treatment plant with a capacity of 120,000 m3/d and reservoir (20,000 m3)
will be constructed at Cam Dai. The location of the plant at Cam Dai with
elevation of between 35-45 m will allow gravity supply with minimum pressure in
the network of 10 m. The treatment technology and type of treatment units will be
subject to selection on basis of performance bids. The bidding documents will
identify site, critical elevations of structures, soil and foundation conditions,
quality of raw water and required quality of treated water and will specify
required performance of the plant.
Network, metering and connections
44.   The network will be improved by construction of: (a) transmission main from
the treatment plant to Cam Le (2.0 km, 1200 mm diameter); (b) primary and
secondary distribution mains (57 km, with diameters varying from 1200-150 mm),
including master meters; (c) tertiary network (206 km, with diameters varying
from 100-50 mm) with about 40,000 metered individual connections and repair of
about 12,000 residential service connections. Metering within the network will be
strengthened by installing large meters.
Support equipment
45.   Support will include provision of various equipment for maintenance of
network, various vehicles with loading equipment, and spare parts.
Construction management and institutional support7
46.   Construction  management  will  support  the  Danang  WSC  in  day-to-day
supervision of construction. The consultant assistance will include verifying the
compliance with specification for works and goods, supervising the adherence to
6 The need for protection of the intake against salinity intrusions and technical aspects of such protection
will be determined by separate studies to be carried out within the component's technical assistance.

the construction schedule, testing and commissioning the completed works,
approving manuals for operation and maintenance, advising on training of staff
identified to operate completed facilities, preparing progress reports and other
documents required for carrying out the works.
47.   Institutional support will be focused on facilitating commercialization of
the WSC, on supporting the project implementation by carrying out various
studies, on training to ensure proper operation and maintenance of facilities and
on preparing the follow-up project.   Support to commercialization will include:
(a) upgrading of accounts receivable accounting module, (b) improved customer
relations,   including  associated  field  work   (mapping,   customer  register,
disconnection-reconnection, etc.), and (c) development of O&M guidelines to form
a basis for establishing adequate budget allocations and evaluation of company
performance.
48.   Supporting studies will include monitoring of the water quality in the
source, evaluation of data and plan of action for future use of that source and
identification of actions aimed at protection of the source against pollution,
and  assessment  of  factors  contributing  to  observed  internal  and  external
corrosion of pipes.
49.   Training with key emphasis on skill development will include local training
of trade categories and non-professional staff; greater external exposure of
professional staff will be provided through study tours, language training, and
participation in national and regional professional conferences
50.   Training will focus on (a) accounting staff, to ensure that modified and
improved accounting modules are implemented; and (b) operational staff, to ensure
that new facilities are properly operated and maintained in accordance with
standard public utilities practices. The operational staff which required
training are categories such as treatment plant operators, pump attendants, pipe
fitters, water meter mechanics, water meter readers, i.e. essentially trade
categories which are not formatted within the standard educational stream. All
trained staff will be evaluated through suitable testing.   The follow-up water
supply project will expand water production and distribution capacities. Terms of
reference for engineering and other studies to prepare the project will be
completed by the Danang WSC in March 1999.
51.   The construction management is estimated at 705 person-months,  supporting
studies and training at 290 person-months and preparation of follow-up project at
50 person-months. Draft terms of reference for the studies and training programs
are available in the project file.
Land requirement and resettlement
52.   The component will require 20.3 ha of land in total comprising of 12 ha of
eucalyptus plantation (which belong to government) for construction of Cam Dai
WTP, water reservoir and an access road; 4 ha of rice field for the sludge
lagoon; 1.35 ha of rice field for Yen Ne intake; and 3 ha of rice field and
inhabited land for construction of 2.2 km access road from Yen Ne intake to Cam
Le WTP. The latter will also involve resettlement of about 98 households.



71                    ANNEX  2
Construction of a raw water main from Yen Ne to Cam Dai WTP will require
temporary land (rice field and cultivation) of about 10 ha, as will laying of
distribution network along 263 km of roads.

VIETNAM
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Environmental impact
Requirements
1.    The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (MOSTE) administers the
Environmental Protection Law (EPL-1993) through its Department of Natural Resources
and Environment. The Department is also responsible for recommendations on policy,
rules, regulations, and guidelines, including environmental quality standards, and
reviewing and approving environmental impact assessments  (EIA) .  The People's
Committee (PC), assisted by provincial environmental department (DOSTE) is
responsible for implementing the EPL, including monitoring and enforcement.
2.    EIAs are required for development projects under the EPL.  Large projects,
including those with an investment cost of more than US$20 million, must submit an
EIA to MOSTE for approval. For smaller projects, it is submitted to the DOSTE.
3.    The project's land acquisition and resettlement would affect a limited number
of people; most of the other negative impacts are temporary, which would be
mitigated through good planning and construction practices. According to World Bank
(WB) guidelines, the proposed project is classified as a category "B" project, which
requires an environmental management plan (EMP) satisfactory to the Bank.
Proiect Description
4.    The project involves rehabilitation and expansion of water supply facilities
in Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh, and Danang and will be implemented by the various
cities' water supply companies (WSCs) from 1997-2001. Details are in Annex 2.
EIA Studies
5.    The EIAs were carried out as part of the feasibility studies and the reports
are available in the project file.  They concluded the project will positively
affect the living standards and health conditions of the population. Rehabilitation
of the existing facilities will decrease the level of non-revenue water while
expansion of treatment plants and transmission and distribution lines will improve
the quality of water provided and increase the amount of water supply, service
levels and revenues.
6.    The project's negative impacts would only be temporary, minor and reversible
which can be mitigated through proper policy and project planning, public relations,
and good construction and supervision practices. The engineering preparation of the
project was guided by the requirement to reduce land acquisition and resettlement
as much as possible.   Therefore,  the project will require only limited land
acquisition, relocation of population and demolition of houses.
7.    Serious  negative  impacts  during  site  clearing,   rehabilitation,  and



106                         ANNEX 7
construction of the project facilities are not expected. Most of the WTPs, intakes,
and other facilities are located far from residential areas. The mountainous area
in Quang Ninh where raw water mains will be laid and the hill in Danang where the
WTP will be constructed are degraded and serious impacts on ecology are not
expected. Construction of the distribution networks will be carried out along the
roads  and  sidewalks.    While  serious  adverse  impacts  on  residents  are not
anticipated, consultations with the affected population will be carried out prior
to construction; in addition, at the design phase, efforts will be made to further
reduce land requirements.  The standard measures to mitigate the impacts during
construction, including provision of adequate and safe water during the interruption
the water services, will be required and included in the bidding and contract
documents.
8.    During operation, the WTPs would generate treatment sludge and improved water
supply would contribute to increasing volumes of wastewater. The sludge would be
disposed of in sludge retention lagoons in WTPs and when dried, disposed of in
controlled landfills. Increases in wastewater volumes would have no significant
impact on the current status; in addition, the sanitation project being prepared in
the four cities would improve current conditions.
9.    Serious impacts on water resources are not anticipated since the abstraction
and pumping rates are relatively small compared to the annual average flow in the
water resources.   Monitoring of land subsidence and possible contamination of
groundwater in Hanoi is important, and the program established and carried out by
the city will be continued.   For Quang Ninh, the safety of Cao Van dam will be
improved and monitored. Trees and large shrubs in the reservoir were removed before
filling, to improve the water quality. A program to protect the relevant watersheds,
water quality at the intakes and in the water supply system against pollution will
be developed and implemented (see Annex 2).
Environmental Management Plans
10.   In line with the EPL, the project's EIAs were cleared by MOSTE.  Also, the
World Bank requires that, based on the EIAs, the WSCs would prepare an environmental
management plan (EMP) and a resettlement action plan (RAP) for each component.
Accordingly, the WB received information on MOSTE's clearance and EMPs for each
component before appraisal and found them satisfactory.
11.   The EMPs summarize the mitigation measures proposed for the construction and
operation of the components and are available in the project file. The measures are
summarized below and those mitigating the adverse impacts due to land acquisition
and resettlement are summarized in the next section.
12.   During construction, the contractors will be required to carry out the works
according to international standards, including consulting with residents; providing
safe and adequate temporary paths for residents and businesses; providing adequate
safety to the public and workers; implementing effective measures to reduce erosion,
dust, and noise due to construction equipment; providing limited transport and
construction along the main roads in urban areas during rush hours and in the
residential areas at night; appropriately disposing of surplus soil and construction



107                        ANNEX 7
materials; and providing adequate water supply by other means when the system is
interrupted.   These requirements are included in the bidding documents and the
contractors will be liable for all damages caused by non-compliance.
13.   Prior to starting construction, the WSCs will inform the public and residents
about the project through various means/media and EIA reports will be made available
for public review. The public relation program will be carried out on a continuous
basis.  During construction, WSCs assisted by consultants, will cooperate with
affected residents and take all measures needed to minimize the impacts to the
residents and public.
14.   The increase in the quantity of piped water produced would substitute for
existing non-piped sources leading to minimal net increase in the quantity of
wastewater generated. Pollution control is planned through a separate sanitation
project now under preparation.   To ensure adequate protection of water quality
against pollution at the intakes and in the water supply systems, a monitoring
program and various investigations will be conducted in each component; terms of
references for the studies are available in the project file. Training will also
be provided in the project to ensure effective operation and maintenance of the
water supply facilities.
15.   Specific programs for Hanoi, Quang Ninh and Danang systems will also be
carried out under the project's technical assistance. This includes monitoring
groundwater and land subsidence in Hanoi; enhancing the safety of Cao Van dam in
Quang Ninh; and conducting a comprehensive study of Cau Do River in Danang.
Technical assistance for Hanoi will be financed by the Finnish Government while for
Quang Ninh and Danang, it will be provided by the Danish and the Australian
Governments, respectively.
Land Acquisition and Compensation
16.   A total of about 36 ha will be acquired of which over one quarter are under
the responsibility of government agencies. Most of the remaining hectares are rice
fields; about 30 houses will be removed for the construction of an access road in
Danang. The land acquisition process will be carried out in line with the national
laws and appropriate compensation will be paid to the affected families.  Land
requirements for the project components are given in Annex 2 and summarized in Table
A-7.1.
17.   The government policy on land acquisition and compensation was reviewed during
appraisal and found to be acceptable in principle.   The Land Law (1993), and
implementation directives issued by the provincial PCs stipulate land categories,
compensation procedures, and price ceilings for loss of land and property (houses,
other structures, trees, crops, etc). During the process, representatives of the
affected families will be included on the compensation committees and will have the
means to redress grievances.
18.   The land acquisition process normally takes about 2-3 months and is summarized
as follows:



108                         ANNEX 7
* The WSC, consulting with the local government (communes), will carry out a
field survey identifying the type of land use, number of people affected,
extent of the impacts, and the estimated amount of compensation;
* The WSC will submit the survey with the request for land acquisition and a
proposal for compensation to the Land Service Department (LSD);
* After receiving the request, LSD will carry out a field inspection,
confirming the type of land categories, number of the affected population and
the level of compensation, and submit a recommendation to the provincial PC;
* The PC will establish a compensation committee, consisting of
representatives from the WSC, concerned agencies, local PC, and affected
population to evaluate the adequacy of the compensation and consult/negotiate
with the affected groups. The committee will submit the results to the PC for
approval;
* If agreement is reached, the WSC will compensate the affected people
directly and the right to use the land will be transferred to the WSC, so
construction can begin;
* If the affected families are not satisfied with the decision, they can
submit their proposals to the  provincial PC for consideration within 15
days. The PC will respond to the proposal within 1 month;
* Any land acquisition of more than 5 ha must be approved by the Prime
Minister's Office.
Implementation of the EMPs/RAPs
19.   During appraisal, the compensation policy for each component was reviewed in
the light of the World Bank policy on resettlement and the WSCs agreed to proceed
as follows:
* The proposed EMPs/RAPs presented in the project implementation plans (PIPs)
will be timely and strictly implemented and results will be periodically
reported to IDA;
* During the design stage for the water mains and distribution networks,
efforts will be made to minimize: (a) the impacts on houses, buildings and
graves; (b) land requirements; and (c) excavation of large quantities of
soil. The aim will also be to lay the pipes along the side of roads where
impacts on households and businesses are less intrusive. Where the damages is
more serious, pipes will be laid under the roads;
* Bidding documents will include specific mitigation measures required during
construction, and the contractors will be liable for damages caused by non-
compliance;
* EIAs will be made available for public review; consultation with the public
and residents will be carried out through various means/media on a continuous
basis;
* During construction, the WSC, assisted by consultants, will supervise the
work and inform residents and the public about all aspects of the project;
* WSC will be responsible for preparing and implementing the RAP, consulting
with the affected groups, and carrying out the land acquisition process
according to national laws. Efforts will be made to ensure that the affected
population are not worse off after the project, and that their incomes and
living standards are recovered or improved. The process will be completed at



109                         ANNEX 7
least one month before construction begins;
* The affected assets will be compensated at their replacement value and
depreciation will not be considered during the calculation;
* Representatives of the affected population will be included as members of
the compensation committee to ensure their concerns are adequately addressed
during the acquisition process and that the level of compensation is
acceptable;
* WSC will conduct a detailed survey on the affected population, including
living standards, level of income, other social conditions, opinions about
the project component, and the level of compensation and other assistance.
Farmers loosing more than 25% of their total holdings will be identified, and
a program to provide assistance will be developed so their economic
conditions can be reconstituted. Results of the survey, including the level
of compensation and payment schedule as proposed by WSC and, if possible, as
agreed with the affected people, will be submitted to IDA for review;
* Along with the above, WSC will proceed with the formal process and
incorporate IDA comments; the compensation plan approved by the Government
will then be submitted to IDA;
* Land acquisition will be carried out in line with the project
implementation schedule and will be completed at least one month before
construction begins;
Particular Actions
* In Hanoi, a program to protect groundwater and the water supply system
against pollution will be prepared and implemented, and the existing program
to monitor groundwater and land subsidence will be continued;
* In Haiphong, a program to protect water quality at Quan Vinh intake and the
water supply system against pollution will be prepared and implemented;
* In Quang Ninh, a program to strengthen safety at the Cao Van dam and to
protect water quality at the intakes and in the water supply system against
pollution will be prepared and implemented;
* In Danang, details on the land acquisition of the access road from Yen Ne
intake to the existing WTP at Cam Le will be prepared and submitted to IDA
for review. Also, a program to study Cao Do River and protect water quality
at the intakes and in the water supply system against pollution will be
prepared and implemented.
During appraisal, the WSCs confirmed the above agreements.
Government Approval of the EIAs and Compliance
20.   The EIA reports for the Hanoi, Haiphong, Quang Ninh and Danang components were
submitted to MOSTE and the environmental clearances were obtained between August and
October 1996.  Each implementing agency (WSC) declared its willingness to comply
with all conditions as required by MOSTE; compliance will be monitored by the
DOSTEs. The MOSTE and DOSTE capacity, although still limited, is being gradually
upgraded by the Government, helped by various bilateral grants.

Outline of the evaluation report on project implementation
7.    The evaluation report will be prepared by each WSC.  It should not exceed ten
pages and the performance judgments and analyses should cover the following specific
aspects:
(a)   Project  objectives.   A concise  statement  and evaluation of major
objectives as presented in the SAR, including any changes made during
implementation.    The  evaluation  will  assess  the  clarity  of  the
objectives, their realism, and whether they are important for the
country and sector.
(b)   Achievement of project objectives.   An assessment of the project's
success (substantial, partial, negligible) in achieving its major
objectives - e.g. sector policy improvements, financial objectives,
institutional development, physical objectives, other social objectives,
environmental objectives, and public sector management and private
sector development.
(c)   Implementation record and major factors affecting the project.   An
analysis of the factors that affect implementation.   The factors are
divided into those not generally subject to government or provinces
control, those subject to government and provinces control, and those
subject to water companies control.
(d)   IDA  performance.     An  assessment  of  IDA's  performance   (highly
satisfactory, satisfactory, deficient) in project identification,
preparation assistance, appraisal, and supervision.
(e)   Water companies and provinces performance.   An assessment of the
performance of involved water companies and provinces (highly
satisfactory, satisfactory, deficient) in preparing, implementing, and
operating the project.
(f)   Assessment of outcome.   A rating of outcome  (highly satisfactory,
satisfactory, unsatisfactory, or highly unsatisfactory) based primarily
on how well the project achieved its objectives and how sustainable it
is likely to be.
(g)   Future operation.   A description and assessment of the plan for the
project's future operation, including understanding the measures to
maximize the project benefits, and the indicators for monitoring and
evaluating future operations.
(h)   Key lessons learned.  A discussion of the most significant positive and
negative lessons learned from the project's implementation, showing how
they are reflected in the arrangements for its future operations. This
section also identifies those lessons most relevant to similar ongoing
and future projects in this sector in Vietnam.
8.    WSCs will submit the evaluation report to IDA after completing the project and
in time stipulated in the Project Agreement.

Income statement
17.   Revenues:  Water revenues  have  been projected  to  increase  in line with
estimated increased water supply, and annual increases of water tariffs. Water
supply is projected to increase by about 5% p.a. from 1996 through 2000, partly as
a result of the French Government financed network upgrading project, and by about
34% in 2001 and 69% in 2002 following the completion of the Cam Dai treatment plant
at the end of 2001. NRW is projected to remain at 30% from 1996 through 2004.
Average water tariffs are assumed to increase by 18% in 1996, 10% p.a. from 1997 to
2000, 15% in 2001, and 20% thereafter.
18.   Operational costs: Staff costs: Include wages, bonuses and other benefits for
WBC staff. A 4% annual increase in constant prices has been added to pay levels.
Other costs: Projected expenses are increased in proportion to additional production
capacity. Depreciation: The calculation of 5.65% p.a. has been made on the weighted
average of all fixed assets in operation.
Balance sheet
19.   Fixed assets: Include network, treatment plants (including land), with the
addition of plant and equipment when new assets are placed in service, and are

revalued at annual projected inflation rates. Accounts receivable: Based on past
experience, these have been assumed to reduce from 57 days in 1996 to 42 days' sales
by 2004. Inventories: These have been assumed to increase in proportion to
additional net fixed assets in service. Accounts payable: Historical figures have
been projected to increase in line with operational expenses.
Source and application of funds
20.   Other  capital  contributions:  Actual  and projected  contributions  by  the
Australian Government to support the WSC through trainers and advisors; other
additions consist of equity contributions by the Government equal to the amount of
interest during construction included in the cost of the project; and municipal
equity of VND 45 billion. Loans: The IDA US$33.8 million (VND 372.0 billion) credit
is assumed to be on-lent to the WSC by the Government over 20 years, with a five
year grace period, at interest rate of 6.5% p.a.
21.   Interest during construction: Capitalized interest charged at 6.5% p.a. on the
on-lent IDA (ITF) credit from 1997 through 2001.

Project performance monitoring
1.          The Monitoring and Evaluation  (M&E)  system is designed to. provide
managers with information on progress towards project objectives, impact on
beneficiaries, and institutional, technical and financial aspects that could be
useful in the commercial operation of the water supply companies. Three basic
components would be proposed for the M&E system:
a)    Performance Agreements between the PCs and WSCs;
b)    Public Performance Audits (PPAs) of WSCs by an independent agency; and
c)    More traditional tracking of project milestones in terms of measuring
progress achieved against specific targets in project implementation
plans.
Performance Agreements
2.          Performance Agreements (PA) would be intended to provide incentives for
the management of WSCs which are state enterprises to improve performance. The
criteria, their base values and annual targets and weights, and the evaluation
methodology would be agreed between the PCs and the management of WSCs at the
beginning of each year. The PA would be closely linked to the Corporate Plan of the
WSC. Bonus payments would be linked to performance measured against the PA.
Performance Agreements introduced for state enterprises including WSCs in Thailand
would be used as the model to be adapted to the specific conditions in Vietnam.
Public Performance Audits
3.          An  independent  agency  would  collect  information  on  performance
indicators of WSCs and make comparative information available for public disclosure.
The information would include indicators most relevant to consumers such as water
quality, pressure, reliability, etc. A simple grading system based on color coding
(e.g., gold for good, green for acceptable, black for unacceptable) would make the
information easily comprehensible to consumers. Public disclosure of comparative
information would generate pressure to improve performance and competition amongst
the water supply companies.
Project Milestones
4.          Traditional milestones,  in addition to the above, would be used to
evaluate project progress by the supervision missions. A detailed list of indicators
is provided in Table A 11.1 while key performance indicators relevant during project
implementation, agreed upon during negotiations, are highlighted in Table A 11.3.
The key performance indicators were identified using the Performance/Risk Summary
shown in Table A 11.2.

ANNEX 12
VIETNAM
WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Rate of return
Data
1.    Data for the "without project" scenario is taken from the WSCs' income statements
in Annex 9. The base year is taken to be 1995, the last full year for which complete
accounts are available. Data on water produced, percentage of water billed and average
tariff are used to compute gross revenues. Operating expenses are adjusted by deleting
the item for non-collected bills which is not an expense and the item for connection
charges which would be financed out of the capital budget. For purposes of the rate of
return computation, the "without project" scenario assumes the 1995 values to remain
constant in real terms except for operating expenses which are assumed to increase in
real terms by 0.5% per year due to system deterioration. The base values are shown in
Table A 12.1.
2.    For the "with project" scenario, Table A 12.2 shows the project investment costs
(from Annex 3), excluding price contingencies, and the phasing of annual investment used
in the analysis. Operating costs are also taken from Annex 9 and projected using 1995
unit costs for the various cost categories, except staff costs, and multiplying them by
the amount of water produced in each year. Thus no efficiency gains or economy of scale
factors are built in. Staff costs are projected to increase at 4% per year in real terms
reflecting rising real income levels in Vietnam. Both investment costs and operating
costs are in constant 1995 values.
3.    No additional water is assumed to be available till 2000. However, non-revenue
water is projected to begin decreasing earlier as technical assistance focused on
improved billing and collection will be completed prior to the project becoming
effective. This is reasonable since administrative losses greatly exceed physical losses
in WSCs in Vietnam. Tariffs are also assumed to increase from 1997 as this has been
agreed with the PPCs. The variables are assumed to reach steady state in 2004.
Assumptions
4.    For the economic analysis, all costs are expressed in 1995 prices, making no
adjustments for shadow exchange rate or shadow labor costs in line with the assumption
made in Power sector projects in Vietnam. Electricity costs are not adjusted as the WSCs
are being charged 600 VND per kWh which is the long run marginal cost of supply at the
high voltage level. Staff and electricity costs comprise the bulk of operating costs.
There is some evidence that prices of chemicals are subsidized to the WSCs. However,
these are less than 10% of total operating costs and are not adjusted. Rather, any
likely impact is evaluated through sensitivity analysis on total operating costs. The
sensitivity results indicate that it is not worthwhile to make adjustments for the
distortion in the price of chemicals. Household size is taken to be 4.5 in each city.
Results
5.    Tables A 12.3, A 12.4 and A 12.5 show the data used, the computations and the
sensitivity analysis for the FIRR. Tables A 12.6, A 12.7 and A 12.8 are the
corresponding tables for the EIRR.
