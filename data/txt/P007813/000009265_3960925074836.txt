PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT (LOAN 2020-PAN)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Road
Rehabilitation Project in Panama, for which Loan 2020-PAN in the amount of US$
19.0 million was approved on June 2, 1981. The loan was closed on June 30,
1989, four years behind schedule, after US$ 14,709,405.52 was disbursed and an
undisbursed amount of US$ 4,290,594.48 canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy Sector
operations Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Country Department II
(Preface, Evaluation Summary and Parts I and III). Part II was prepared by
the Borrower.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan and Guarantee Agreements; internal Bank Memoranda, reports/data received
from the Borrower, and information available from the Project Files.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT (LOAN 2020-PAN)
EVALUATION SUEMARY
Obiectives
1.        The main objective of the project, which was to support d
comprehensive maintenance policy, was only partly achieved. Specific
objectives of the physical component, in terms of roads rehabilitated,
workshop constructed and improved and weighing scales purchased were achieved
by some 66Z (see para. 6.01). The project objective of freeing resources to
increase maintenance activities was not achieved. Mechanics were trained but
maintenance equipment availability worsened due lo lack of spare parts. The
vehicle weighing regulations were passed in March 6, 1990, but not enforced.
(paras. 6.02 to 6.07).
Implementation and Results
2.        Implementation of the project was adversely affected by the
allocation of insufficient counterpart funds and lack of staff continuity
(paras. 5.03 to 5.07). As a result of the austerity measures imposed in 1985,
the project investments were reduced and spread over six years instead of the
four years originally anticipated at appraisal. Bank financing participation
increased from 60Z to 80? to offset lack of counterpart funds and assist the
Government, that was facing fiscal problems. Frequent changes in project
management were another source of delay in project execution. It also
complicated the task of institution building.   The project was implemented at
higher unit costs than estimated in the Appraisal report (par. 5.08-5.09).
The re-evaluated Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for a sample of rehabilitated
roads was 9.9Z, or 7.5X lower than the 17.4 Z projected using appraisal
assumptions. Differences mainly reflect reduction in benefits due to a fall
in traffic below the levels that had been anticipated. If roads are not
maintained appropriately, the ERR would drop to about 0.
3.        On November 30, 1987, disbursements on all Bank loans to Panama
were suspended due to failure to pay debt service. As a result of the
prolonged suspension, the closing date of the loan was not extended beyond
June 30, 1989, and US$ 4.29 million were canceled from the loan, even though
the physical targets had not yet been achieved.



- iii -
Sustainability
4.        The roads rehabilitated would only be able to maintain an
acceptable flow of net benefits throughout their economic life, if routine and
periodic maintenance are carried out appropriately. Based on experience to
date, the Government is not providing adequate maintenance. Unless this
changes, the project benefits will not be sustained. On the other hand,
additional benefits will be attaiied if the Government concludes two of the
three road rehabilitation works that remained uncompleted (the Penonome-
Churuquita and the Entrada Rio de Jesus-Sona-Calles sectior.s); we understand
that this is now planned for late 1991.
5.        Sustainability of the institutional achievements is also in
question, and these were quite modest when compared to the original
objectives. First, an important factor for sustaining project benefits will
be that maintenance receives priority in highway sector fund allocations, and
that has not been the case. Second, the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) is not
in a position to internalize fully the benefits of training, as its salaries
are not competitive, causing migration of some of the trainees to the private
sector. Third, the required vehicle weight and dimension limits can be
implemented as enabling legislation has been passed. However, up to now
enforcement has been weak.
6.        Finally, a lately announced change in Government policy, shifting
maintenance works from force account to contract, presents an opportunity to
reorient the use of resources. A new scenario with private sector involvement
could make a difference, but such improvements as do occur would not be linked
to the project but to the changes in policies that started to be considered by
the Government after the loan was closed. In this context, the task initiated
under the project must be considered half finished, providing a rationale for
a follow up operation with an important institutional development component,
aimed at building supervision and contractual capabilities, once conditions in
Panama allow resumption of Bank lending. Given Panama's economic problems and
needs, however, a follow-up operation will compete with funding to other
sectors, suggesting that it will only be justified if it is supported by a
strong Government commitment to address the various issues highlighted in this
report.
Findings and Lessons Learned
7.         The project put all the emphasis on "in house" maintenance
capabilities. Now the Government is abandoning the 'force account" policy.
Progressively, contracting out road maintenance can be a better approach than
building the force account establishment, as it may bring in the greater
dynamism resulting from competition between private contractors.
8.        The project execution and results were affected by some deep rooted
problems in the management of the sector (excessive personnel, low salaries,



- iv -
high turnover of key staff), which are present in general in Panama's public
administration. The Bank should seek to engage the Government in a discussion
of these issues, and should be willing to provide assistance, for instance,
under a Public Sector Reform operation. Government commitment towards an
enhanced public services and related up-front conditionality will be necessary
if the Bank's involvement is to provide lasting benifits.

FoAD REHABILTATION PROJECT (LOAN 2020-PAN)
PART I
Proiect Review from Bank's Persnective
1.        Project Identity
Project Name: Road Rehabilitation
Loan No.s 2020-PA
RVP Unit: Latin America and the Caribbean
Country: Panama
Sector: Transportation
Sub-sector: Roads
2.        Proiei.c Background
2.01      Panama, a long and narrow country, is divided lengthwise by a
mountain range and across by the Panama Canal. As a result, the country has
developed along two main axis, one along the Canal and the other along the
Pacific Coast. Domestic traffic is almost exclusively moved over roads (97
percent of all freight and 99 percent of passengers) with a total network of
8400 km. one third paved, one third graveled and one third earth roads.
2.02      Since the end of the 1970., the Bank's involvement in Panama
infrastructure's sector was aimed at assisting the Government in improving the
efficiency of its investments. Accordingly, this project was designed to: (i)
preserve or extend the useful life of existing facilities; (ii) avoid heavy
new capital investments; and (iii) emphasize the best use of existing
capacity. In accordance with this strategy, at the time of presenting this
project to the Board of Executive Directors in June 1981, the Bank was also
actively considering two other rehabilitation projects; one for the Canal
ports of Cristobal and Balboa, and another one for the water and sewerage
system in Panama city and downtown Colon.
2.03        The need for a road rehabilitation program was identified during
the supervision of the previous project, the Highway Maintenance Project (Ln.
1565-PAN). There was a considerable backlog in periodic maintenance, mainly
on paved roads but also on gravel roads, which taxed the capacity of the
maintenance forces. In addition, routine maintenance became very expensive
and gave poor results as roads were not in adequate maintainable condition.
Under the project, the rehabilitation of the main roads was expected to reduce
the need for future maintenance expenditures. This in turn would allow the
Directorate of Road Maintenance (DRM) to extend maintenance to all roads by
1984, without substantial increases in budgetary requirements.



2.04      During the period of project implementation (1982-89), Pan&ma
confronted a deteriorsting economic situation. Real per capita output
stagnated since 1530.  The principal growth sources since 1970  -the public
sector and the internationally-oriented service sector  eroded.  The public
sector was under a severe financial constraint: it had to service, under
conditions of acute scarcity of commercial credit, an external debt of 73
percent of GDP. larger in relative terms than those of Argentina, Bra7il or
Mexico. The service sector relied on Panama's role as an international
financial center and as a provider of commercial services linked to its
geographic location. While this latter role has potential for expanding, the
first one will depend on Panama's ability to regain the confidence of the
international community, and this will largely depend on the consolidation of
the political process and the implementation of needed adjustmwnts measures.
3.        Proiect Objectives and Description
3.01      The project was aimed at supporting a comprehensive four-year
maintenance program (1982 to 1985). Its main objectives were: (a) to
eliminate the backlog of re-gravelirg, resealing and overlays; (b) to upgrade
the Ministry of Public Works' (MOP) maintenance organization and ircrease its
efficiency; and (c) to support improvement in transport planning.
3.02      The eatimated cost of the project was US$ 31.7 million with a
foreign exchange component to be financed by the Bank of US$ 19.0 million.
The main project components, as described in the Staff Appraisal Report, were:
(a) civil works consisting in resealing, overlaying and reconstructing
of about 400 km of paved roads and re-graveling of about 50 km of
secondary roads;
(b) measures to build up MOP's maintenance capacity including: (i)
purchase of equipment and spare parts to increase production of road
construction and maintenance materials; (ii) workshop improvements;
(iii) vehicle weighing equipment, to expand and improve axle load
control; and (iv) technical assistance for equipment repair and fleet
management, training of road and equipment maintenance personnel, and
organizational improvements in MOP; and
(c) technical assistance to strengthen transport planning within t1-3
Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy (MIPPE).
4.        Proiect Desian and Organization
4.01      The project was designed to support a combined strategy  of :oad
rehabilitation, provision of equipment, spares and workshops, and
institutional strengthening, aimed at augmenting the maintenance capabilities
of the Directorate of Road Maintenance, within MOP. The components chosen for
Bank loan financing were determined by constraints that had been identified



luring the implementation of the Highway Maintenance Project. These included
lack of space in the workshops, shortages of qualified mechanical staff, lack
of spare parts storage/distribution system, anA' insufficient vehicle weight
and axle load enforcement. The project was prepared by MOP with Bank
assistance.  Overall the project was well prepared and satisfactory at the
conceptual and plauning levels. In retrospect, the design could have been
improved by considering an increased reliance on external contracting, rather
thasn relying on in house expertise for maintenance.
4.02      MOP was responsible for the implementation of the project.
Coordination of work in connection with the implementation of the project was
entrusted to the project director, an engineer recruited outside MOP. The
project also relied on the managerial capabilities and actions of various MOP
Directors. Detailed engineering studies and preparation of contract documents
were the responsibility of MOP's Directorate of Studies and Design.
4.03      Construction contracts were managed by MOP 's Directorate of
Inspection, which established field offices in the provinces for that purpose.
Major works were executed by contract and the lowest level of rehabilitation
work by force account, using MOP's surplus capacity in the provincial
offices. Supervision and quality control were contracted out with private
firms. Nine provincial Directorates were in charge of execution of the
maintenance program. This organization proved to be adequate. although it
suffered from staff turnover problems.
5         Proiect Implementation
5.01      Three major variances between planned and actual project
implementation are noticeable. The extension of the original schedule by two
years, the reduction of scope (250 km of roads rehabilitated instead of the
original 450 km), and the increased costs. Also, minor procurement problems
occurred. These aspects are elaborated next.
5.02      Imolementation Schedule:  On May 1986, five months after the loan's
original closing date, the disbursement of loan proceeds was US$ 11.4 million,
602 of the original estimate. Project implementation was delayed due to: (i)
insufficient availability of counterpart funds; and (ii) frequent changes in
project management 1/.
(1) Delays have to be judged in the Panamanian context. Two inf t:structure projects in execution
by the time of the approval of the loan suffered from similar de sys: Loan 1565-PAN (Highway
Maintenance) started one year behind schedule, as a consequence of a change in government
policy. Changes in the borrower management had also slowed down the execution of Loan 1280-PAN
(Water Supply Project).



5.03      Lack of Counterpart Funds: This was one of the key issues tha'
affected project implementation. Lack of funds was partly the result of
Govornment's austerity measures required by a reduction in fiscal ravenues and
a very large debt servicing requirements. The problem of inadequate funds
became unsuptainable in 1987 when Panama became increasingly unable to service
its debt. In November 1987 the Bank suspended loan disbursements, as Panama
had stopped servicing its debts to the Bank.
5.04      During project implementation, the main consequences of the lack of
funds weres (a) increased road deterioration, as timely repairs were not made;
(b) price escalation; (c) total standstill of the civil works at some stages
of the project; (d) a training uni.t standing idle, without performing its
functions; and (e) management ineffectiveness due to budget uncertainties.
5.05      The problem of lack of funds was exacerbated by time-consuming
bureaucratic procedures. For example, four signatures, from Government
agencies outside MOP, were required in order to award a contract. In some
cases, the signatures needed included that of the President. This problem, wa
understand, is still present and should be addressed in futurA loans to the
country.
5.06      The lack of counterpart funding, identified as a major risk in the
President's Report, was thoughtfully considered by the Bank staff assigned to
the project. Many actions were recommended and taken at different stages of
the project with limited degree of success, including: (i) establishing, as
condition of effectiveness, and then as a yearly covenant, the requirement
that maintenance be funded adequately. About 730 kilometers were to receive
periodic maintenance in the 1983-85 period. However, this was not complied by
the government and the conditionality of the loan was not sufficient to
influence the allocation of reduced resources among construction and
maintenance.  In fact, in some fiscal years, funds for maintenance were only
about 30X of those required; (ii) creating a project account to operate as a
revolving fund (August 1982); this proved to be only partially successful, as
the Government often failed to make timely replenishment when the account was
depleted; (iii) proposing a mirT-mum viable program to maintain the basic
strategy with reduced resourceb (October 1982). The program consisted in
extending 10 month contracts to 16 months period, reduc:ng yearly required
expenditure from B. 7 million to B. 5 million, and maintaining the basic
strategy of rehabilitating high priority road sections. The Bank induced
MIPPE to commit the funding for this minimum program and later gramtei1 a two-
year extension request of the loan closing date; and (iv) increasing the
portien financed by the Bank, from 55-60? to 80Z, taking into account the lack
of counterpart funds availability (1987). In retrospect, the underlying
causes of the problem were not project related but due to macroeconomic
factors and it would not be fair to fault the Bank for failing to introduce
additional safeguards, in all likelihood they would have failed too. In fact,
the decision to increase the Bank's share in project funding seems a gcood
effort to salvage the project.  It would have provided an opportunity to press
for improved compliance in a number of areas if disbursements would have
continued.



5.07      Lack of staff continuity: Lack of staff continuity affected all
stages of project implementation. There was no year oL the project without a
change in staff, involving the Project Manager, the MOP department Directors
and even the Minister of MOP. Substantial managerial changes occurred in
November 1981, August 1982, March 1983, June 1984 and November 1985. These
management changes affected the follow-up of project matters, as no one was
accountable during transition periods. In addition, management changes
produced other delays. For instance, a change of Minister of MOP led to
technical reviews and redesig:n of project road sections for which bids had
previously been called. Also, institution building activities were not
possible in that unstable institutional context.
5.08      Proiect Costs:  The estimated cost of the Road Rehabilitation
Project was US$ 31.7 million for the period 1981-1985. The final actual cost
of the project, in the years 1981-88, was about US$ 23.5 million, but the
figures are not coi'parable as the physical works fell far short of the
original goals.
5.09      Civil works amounted to USS 18.9 million or 6.5Z less than the
original estimate of US$ 20.2 million. This reflects both quantity and price
changes: significantly less kilometers were rehabilitated (243.7 km as
compared to 450 km estimated at appraisal) but at substantially higher unit
costs (US$ 78,500nkm instead of the original estimate of US$ 43,2001km). Unit
cost differences are explained by the lack of detailed engineering at the time
of appraisal, and by additional road deterioration as the works were delayed.
Also, work was done for bridge reh,bilitatiorn which was not included in the
original project (see table 4).
5.10      Procurement:  Procurement problems involving goods procured
occurred, as procedures were not in line with Bank guidelines. In particular,
the acquisition process of the asphalt plant and workshop tools started before
the documents were cleared. However, as the bidding process for these items
was highly advanced, the clearance was given with the ,overnment's assurances
to adhere to ICB procedures in future procurement. This was done when the
Attorney General authorized the same bidding docun-ents for civil works, which
were in line with Bank guidelines, for the acquisition of goods. This
regulatory change also expedited tha xiaplementation of other projects assisted
by the Bank as well as other donors operations. In the end, however, although
contracts for the asphalt plant and tools were signed by MOP with the lowest
bidder, the letters of credit for the items were not obtained, and the
acquisitions were abandoned, due to a shortage of funds.
5.11      Disbursement:  Table 3, part III indicates the estimated and actual
schedule of disbursement. The pace of disbursements was considerably slower
than the appraisal schedule. Inadequate budgetary provision for roads uider
contract or shortly to be contracted, often slowed the progress in
disbursement. The actual disbursements on the other hand, were reasonably in
line with the current LAC standard disbursement profile, suggesting that the
Bank policy to insist upon the use of such guidelines is justified.

5.12      The final allocation of credit funds among the different project
categories followed closely the appraisal estimate with 68.4 Z in civil works,
17.4 Z in equipment and spare parts and the balance, 14.2 Z, in technical
assistance and training.
6.        Project Results
Physical Results
6.01      The project achieved about two-thirds of its specific physical
objectives. The uncompleted works and acquisitions were caused by the lack of
counterpart funds and the cancellation of the loan in June 1989.
Accomplishments, in each component, were as follows:
(i) The Road Rehabilitation Component: 243 km of the project roads were
rehabilitated, out of the original 400 kms planned. The contractors
stopped works on three road sections (23, 56 and 56 km respectively)
because they were not paid. HOP plans to resume these works during
1991. Rehabilitation of 24 bridges, that was added later, was
completed.
(ii) Rehabilitation of Workshops: Out of four workshops to be
rehabilitated, three were completed (Taller Herrera, Veraguas and Los
Santos), and construction of the other workshop (Cocle), which was about
two-thirds completed.
(iii) Construction of Vehicle Weighing Stations: The construction of
three weighing stations, out of a total of five, was completed. The two
remaining ones, at Colon and Capira, had been advertised for bids, but
further processing was stopped.
(iv) Purchase of equipment and Snare parts: Two thirds of the planned
equipment and parts were procured. Three asphalt plants, two fix
weighing scale, spares and a computer were not purchased.



-7-
Institutional Results
6.02      In general, the ability of MOP to absorb and organize the resources
and inputs offered by the project productively was hampered by institutional
constraints: lack of funds for materials and fuel, low salaries for its staff,
non enforcement of vehicle weights and axle load limits, and general political
instability. Project results in terms of the road maintenance system,
equipment management, tecbnical assistance and training and vehicle weights
enforcement, are covered next.
6.03      Road Maintenance System:  The project objective of freeing
resources to increase maintenance activities was not attained. As indicated
in a supervision reports " Little progress in road maintenance was observed in
the field. Maintenance was performed inefficiently, without proper equipment
or organization. The materials used were costly and the results of doubtful
quality and durability." The condition of the network was reported by MOP
officials to have rapidly deteriorated. Maintenance allocations were reduced
in the context of a sharp reduction of total road expenditures. The average
yearly budget assigned to maintenance in 1988-90 was almost one third less
than it had been in 1984-86. As about 70% of expenditures are semi-fixed
costs, devoted to salaries, the reduction actually affected fuel and material
availability in such a way as to make the works impossible to be carried on.

6.04      Eczuipment management system:  The Road Maintenance Department made
progress in introducing the equipment management system developed by
consultants in various MOP provincial workshops and equipment depots.
Nevertheless, further progress was frustrated by inadequate funds. Also,
equipment availability worsened.

6.05      Traininz: One of the project's institutional strengthening
accomplishments has been the creation of a training unit. In the beginning,
the new training department seemed interested and willing to execute its



- 8 -
responsibilities, but lack of funds and commitment from MOP's management
lowered the quality of training output. During 1984-85, some 500 road and
equipment maintenance staff attended one-week technical courses. The courses
were short, generally lacked practical content and the quality of instructors
was considered inadequate. By 1987, finally, an acceptable training program
was implemented and enrolment expanded to about 700 trainees. In 1989 about
360 trainees attended courses and the training unit is still in operations
with a permanent staff of eight. However, it is not possible to quantify the
total staff trained by the project which remained in the agency since the
related documentation was lost in a fire in MOP 's building. It appears,
according to officials interviewed, that some of the staff trained during the
project, mainly mechanics, left MOP in search for better opportunities.

6.06       Technical Assistance: There was a two year delay in starting the
technical assistance for equipment management. Finally, in 1985 the technical
assistance was completed with minor problems involving consultants (see para
11.01). While the equipment management systems were established, the results
were unsatisfactory because of difficulties in retaining personnel for
equipment maintenance and operation, given the prevailing salary differentials
with the private sector. The other T.A. component designed to assist MIPPE in
transport planning was canceled. This was agreed with the Government since
the planning assistance was to be provided under the National Transportation
Plan, with IDB financing. A useful result in this area, was the creation of a
unit, which has been in charge of sector planning end budgeting in MIPPE.
6.07      Vehicle Weithts. Axle Loads and Dimensions: No record of vehicle
over-loadings was available at the time of this report, but it appears that
over-loading has not been reduced. However, the project has been successful
in providing the basic elements required by a vehicle weight control program,
namely: (a) scales and weighing stations are now in place; and (b) the legal
framework to control and enforce vehicle weights and axle loads has been
approved. The law passed in 1989 and was complemented by enabling
legislation, on February 28, 1990. Resources now appear to be available, and
there is the likelihood that the program will be implemented as
responsibilities for control and enforcement were shifted from the Defense
forces to the newly created Land Transport Directorate within the MOP.
Economic Re-evaluation
6.08        The road rehabilitation program was justified at the time of the
appraisal on the basis of vehicle operating costs savings, and a reduction in
annual maintenance costs. Traffic was projected using regression analysis on



- 9 -
the basis of expected population and production growth in 22 regions
(forecasted traffic annual growth levels varied between 0 and 11.61. and
averaged out to about 4.2Z for the period 1981-1990). For the economic re-
evaluation, appraisal projections were adjusted to take into account the
downturn in economic activity. Traffic growth was estimated to drop to 2%
annually for the years 1987-1996. Based on a sample of rehabilitated roads,
the economic rate of return was estimated at 9.91 as compared to 17.4%
according to appraisal assumptions. The difference of 7.51, between expected
and ex-post economic return, is explained by the reduction in benefits due to
fall in traffic. If the rehabilitated roads are not maintained appropriately,
a slightly negative RoR, -0.21, has been estimated.
7.        Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.01      The roads rehabilitated would only be able to maintain an
acceptable flow of net benefits throughout their economic life, if routine and
periodic maintenance is carried out appropriately. Based on experience to
date, the Government is not providing adequate maintenance. Unless this
changes, the project benefits will not be sustained. On the other hand,
additional benefits will be attained if the Government concludes two of the
three road rehabilitation works that remained uncompleted (the Penonome-
Churuquita and the Entrada Rio de Jesus-Sona-Calles sections); we understand
that this is now planned for late 1991.
7.02.     Sustainability of the institutional achievements is also in
question, and these were quite modest when compared to the original
objectives. First, an important factor for sustaining project benefits will
be that maintenance receives priority in highway sector fund allocations,
which has not been the case so far. Second, the Ministry of Public Works
(MOP) is not in the position to internalize fully the benefits of training as
its salaries are not competitive, causing migration of some of the trainees to
the private sector. Third, the required vehicle weight and dimension limits
can be implemented as enabling legislation has been passed. However, up to
now no enforcement has been undertaken.
7.03.     Finally, a lately announced change in Government policy, shifting
maintenance works from force account to contract, presents an opportunity to
reorient the use of resources. A new scenario with private sector
involvement, could make a difference, but such improvements as do occur would
not be linked to the project but to the changes in policies that started to be
considered by the Government after the loan was closed. In this context, the
task initiated under the project must be considered half finished, providing a
rationale for a follow-up operation with an important institutional
development component, aimed at building supervision and contractual
capabilities, once conditions in Panama allow resumption of Bank lending.
Given Panama's economic problems and needs, however, a follow-up operation
will compete with funding to other sectors, suggesting that it will only be
justified if it is supported by a strong Government commitment to address the
various issues highlighted in this report.

8.        Bank Performance
8.01      The Bank made an important financial contribution to the physical
condition of the road network, at a time when lack of funds was causing a
significant deterioration. However, the achievements in the institutional
area fell short of those expected.   Performance must be assessed in the
difficult political and economic context experienced in Panama during the
period of project implementation. In this context, flexibility to consider
changing circumstances was necessary and the Bank did exhibit it. During
implementation, the Bank demonstrated its willingnesa, to support OP by
pressing MIPPE for needed funds; supporting the agency with detailed
discussion of term of reference and design of the technical assistance and
training components; and trying to reduce road construction standards to take
into account financial constraints (Fortuna-Chiriqui Grande road).
8.02      Supervision was generally adequate and sufficiently frequent.  An
average of 2.4 visits to the country were done yearly during eight years,
totalling 69.9 staff-weeks work. Teams were well balanced, with
transportation engineers, economists and equipment, training and financial
specialists. The project was rated by Bank staff supervision as having, in
overall, major problems.
8.03      In retrospect, during project preparation and in the design of
project conditionality the Bank might have sought stronger commitments or
focused upon:
(a) shiftinR maintenance works to contractint.  The project put all the
emphasis on "in house" maintenance capabilities. Conversely. now the
Government is abandoning the "force account" policy. This change
presents an opportunity to consolidate and reorient the use of resources
provided by the project (workshops built or improved, quarry equipment,
equipment, tools) under a new direction for possible Bank assistance to
the road sector.
(b) imDrovina MOP staff salaries and working arranaements. The project
design failed to take into account the need for the MOP to provide
adequate salaries, in order to retain qualified professional staff and
mechanics. Once MOP staff was trained, many left the agency to work in
the private sector where salaries are more competitive. Although
training is the least costly component of a project, conditions
associated with it deserve more attention in the initial project design,
to ensure that it will serve to achieve the intended objective.
(c) estimating costs.  Costs were underestimated because detailed
engineering was not available at the time of Appraisal and road
condition worsened as works were delayed (par. 5.08.)



- 11 -
Borrower Performance
9.01      MOP staff were very cooperative and, in the difficult context that
the country was experiencing. did their best. Unfortunately, the Government
could not bring together a stable managerial team to manage the project and
counterpart financing was not available in accordance with the agreed
schedule.
9.02      The borrower 's performance with respect to the obligations set
forth in the Credit Agreement was not satisfactory. Covenants not complied
with include the regular provision of funds for maintenance (Sec 4.03),
replenishing the project account (Sec 3.05). and furnishing economic and
technical evaluations to the Bank, prior to undertaking new constructions
(section 4.05). The Borrower submitted the economic and technical
justification for a major road in Bocas del Toro, only after construction was
under way. The final status of the covenants is included in Table 6, Part
III.
10.       Project RelationshiRs
10.1      Bank relationship with Government and MOP has been good, despite
the high turnover in borrower's staff and the suspension of disbursements in
November 1987.
11.       Consulting Services
11.01     Project consultants provided valuable assistance to MOP introducing
systems for equipment and plant management, cost control and workshop
procedures for preventive maintenance and unscheduled repairs. These systems
and procedures were integrated in MOP activities. The performance of the
consultants was satisfactory, overall. However, in the first stages of the
project, the consultants output was less than satisfactory and behind
schedule, requiring frequent revisions. The main cause of that problem was
the placement of relatively inexperienced staff in workshop management and
quarry operations. The outcome turned to satisfactory when the firms' most
experienced mechanic was placed in the field for the project, and a highly
experienced staff of the firm, the regional vice-president for Panama,
assumed the direction of the technical assistance.
12.       Prolect Data and Information
12.01     Original project documentation was adequate except that  progress
reports apparently were not prepared by the Borrower (they are not available
in files). Other information relevant to the project assessment, as road
inventories and former trainees on the job, was not obtainable.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PANAMA
ROAD REHABILITATION PROJECT (LOAN 2020-PAN)
COMMENTS FROM THE BORROWER
In general terms, the Project Completion Report prepared by the
World Bank on the Road Rehabilitation Project reflects the true situation
during project implementation. We should like to clarify, however, that due
to cost overruns additional and extensive changes had to be made which delayed
project progress. One of the main reasons that influenced the advance of the
road rehabilitation works was the interpretation given to the term
"rehabilitation" and the concept was distorted and additional works were
included.
During the first years of project implementation, the Government
disbursed the funds in a normal manner.
With respect to procurement, Bank procedures were in conflict with
the provisions of the Panamanian fiscal code, thus, discussions had to be
carried out with the Ministry of Finance and Treasury and with the
Administration's Legal Adviser to clarify certain concepts.
As to the procurement of the computer, shop tools and the asphalt
plant, these were well in advance. A provisional award had been made for the
computer but due to price and further evaluation, final award was not made;
for the other two items, the corresponding Credit Letters had been sent to the
National Bank but at that time the economic crisis was already present for
reasons known to all.
