KARNATAKA SOCIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT 1/
I. INTRODUCTION
Background
1.01      India's designated forests cover 23% of the total land area, or
about 75 million hectares. However, increasing pressures of human (688 m
and growing at 2% per annum) and cattle populations on forest lands for food,
fuel and fodder has resulted in rapid depletion and degradation of much of
the natural forests. Consequently, at present about only 61 million ha (45
million ha exploitable and 16 million ha potentially exploitable) of the
designated forest areas are available for the production of bio-mass.
1.02      In India, non-commercial energy sources, including fuelwood,
agricultural wastes and animal dung, account for nearly 40-50% of the total
consumption of energy. Such fuel contributes to 80% of rural and about 50%
of urban households' energy consumption. Nearly 55% of non-commercial energy
is derived from fuelwood obtained primarily from reserve forests as well as
from trees grown on private and communal lands, gardens and on land around
households. 90% of the consumption of wood is in primary form while about
10% is used as charcoal, briquettes, etc. Much of the fuelwood burnt is
gathered by women, and an estimated 20% of available manpower in farming
families is spent on fuelwood collection. Many families, however, due to the
absence of forest areas adjacent to their homes, are forced to burn only dung
cake and crop residues.
1.03      Although fuelwood as a source of non-commercial energy will con-
tinue to be important into the foreseeable future, the development and
management of fuelwood resources has not, until recently (paras 1.04-1.05)
received the required attention. Requirements for fuelwood in India by the
year 2000 are projected to be nearly 225 million n3. Existing planting
programs should be able to meet most of the industrial requirements for
1/ This report is based on the findings of an appraisal nission which
visited India in January-February 1983, and which consisted of Messrs.
M. 0. Farruk (M4ission Leader), Pyong lloo Rhoe (IDA), Ronald H. Kemp,
George D. Gwyer, and Peter J. Wood (ODA), and R. Noronha (Consultant).

hardwood and, to a lesser extent, for coniferous pulpwood, but are neverthe-
less inadequate for meeting the demand for fuelwood. According to some
estimates, annual plantings of at least 300,000 ha over the next two Develop-
ment Plan periods would be required to meet the projected shortfalls. 1/
Government of India (GOI) Policies for the Sector
1.04      The social, economic and ecological crisis created by the progres-
sive depletion of forest resources has made two things apparent: firstly,
traditional development and management of forest resources will not succeed
in providing the rural and urban population with their basic needs for
forestry products and secondly, development of forest resources outside the
traditional reserve forests through active participation of local communities
will be required to help break the vicious circle created by the shortages of
fuelwood, fodder and small timber. In recognition of this, the National
Forest Policy of 1952, for the first time, recommended functional class-
ification of forests into "village forests" and "tree lands" and thereby laid
the conceptual framework for the social forestry programs of the following
decades. Thus, during the 1950's and 60's, increasing emphasis was given to
plantings on farm, village and communal lands. The GOI-appointed National
Commission on Agriculture gave further impetus to social forestry programs by
more clearly defining the objectives of the program and cogently arguing for
its priority in sectoral development investments. This was subsequently
reflected in the country's Fifth (1974-79) and Sixth (1980-85) Plans which
allocated 49% and 78% of total sectoral allocations, respectively, and 46%
and 70% of total forestry planting targets, respectively, to social forestry.
Present Social Forestry Programs
1.05      GOI has increasingly mobilized domestic and external resources for
implementing a national program for rural afforestation. Through a number
of centrally sponsored schemes, State Governments are being assisted in the
implementation of these programs. The "Social Forestry/Rural Fuelwood Plan-
tations" program, which has a Sixth Five Year Plan allocation of Rs 1,000
million, provides for 50% GOI financing of plantation costs. It emphasizes
plantations in districts that have severe fuelwood shortages, and is now
operational in about 147 such districts. Similar assistance is also provided
by GOI for social forestry plantations established under the National Rural
Employment Program, the Minimum Needs Program and the Drought Prone Areas
Program. Additionally, statewide projects with external financial assistance
are also being implemented in the States of Gujarat, littar Pradesh, West
Bengal, Jammu and Kashrnir (World Bank assisted), Madhya Pradesh and
Maharasthra (USAID assisted) and Tamil Nadu (SIDA). Similar projects for the
1/ IBRD Reports 3480-IN, 3434-IN and 2601a-IN. According to GOI estimates,
nearly 1.5 M ha would need to be planted annually to meet the shortfalls.



-3-
States of Rajasthan, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are also being
contemplated. These represent a total investment of about Rs 6,000 million
over a period of five years, and is expected to result in afforestation of
about 2 million ha by the late 1980's.
Bank Group Role in Social Forestry
1.06    The Bank Group's first intervention, the iladhya Pradesh Forestry
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 609-IN, December 1975) was directed
primarily towards the development of plantation for the pulp and paper
industry. Since then the main thrust of Bank Group operations in this sector
has been in the sphere of social forestry development. So far, four such
projects have been approved: the Uttar Pradesh Social Forestry Project
(Credit 925-IN; US$ 23 million; June 1979); the Gujarat Community Forestry
Project (Credit 961-IN; US$ 37 million; December 1979); the West Bengal
Social Forestry Project (Credit 1178-TN; US$ 29 million; October 1981) and
the Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana Social Forestry Project (Credit 1286-IN;
US$ 33 million; August 1982). In addition to these, the Kandi Watershed and
Area Development Project (Loan 1897-IN; US$ 30 million; July 1980) and the
Himalayan Watershed Management Project (Loan 2295-IN) also include substan-
tial components for reforestation and pasture development. The proposed
project, which was identified and prepared by GOK with assistance from the
GOI, would be the fifth Bank Group operation in this sector and the first
jointly financed with Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the United
Kingdom. IDA has also recently (February 1983) completed a review of the
forestry research, training and education system(s) in India, and which may
lead to further IDA assistance to institutions supporting development of
social forestry programs.
Performance of On-going Projects
1.07      The recent mid-term review of the Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat
projects, and the recent supervisions of the lWest Bengal, and Jamnu and
Kashmir and Haryana projects show that overall progress in tree planting
under those programs has been most satisfactory despite staffing shortages
and high plant mortalities in the early stages of project implementation.
The situation with respect to the latter, however, is improving. Table 1
below summarizes the physical progress of the various planting components:

1.08      The above table shows that tree planting in all categories has
exceeded appraisal targets with the exception of self-help village woodlot
schemes which have proceeded slower than anticipated. There are two main
reasons for this delay:  firstly, the Indian village is not a homogeneous
society and group decisions do not come easily or quickly. Secondly, village
panchayats have a very limited capacity to raise funds either directly or
indirectly for development works. Nevertheless, cooperation between village
and Forest Departments has been good, particularly in respect to protection
of village plantations, and costs of this item are much reduced.
1.09      It is too early to evaluate the impact of on-going social forestry
projects, particularly when monitoring and evaluation systems have not yet
been firmly established. Nevertheless, the mid-term reviews of Gujarat and
UP projects have shown that mortality rates of all categories of plantations
are now low (15-20 %) with the exception of tree planting on waste lands by
small farmers (30-50 %). Factors responsible for this include poor timing of
planting and erratic rains, and inadequate protection of planted trees from
grazing animals. However, experience to-date indicate that given sufficient
resources State Forest Departments are able to implement successfully sub-
stantial programs for rural afforestation.

II. KARNATAKA STATE
A. Socio-Economic Background
2.01      Demographic Features.  The State of Karnataka is situated in South-
west India, with an area of about 192,000 km2 (19.2 million ha) and a popula-
tion of about 37 million (1981). With an average population growth rate of
about 2.4 % per annum during 1971-81, it is one of the fastest growing States
of the Union. Scheduled Castes in 1971 (the last year for which such figures
are available) accounted for 14.1% of the population, and Scheduled Tribes
for 8.4%. Scheduled caste members are distributed throughout the State.
2.02      The labor force constitutes about 35% of Karnataka's population.
Nearly 3.6 million people, equivalent to about 14% of total rural population,
are landless laborers. Average rural per capita income is estimated at about
Rs 750 per year. Nearly 70% of the rural population is considered as living
at or below the poverty threshold, estimated at about Rs 780 per capita per
annum for rural India.
2.03      Agro-climatic Conditions.  The State forms the southwestern part of
the Deccan peninsula. Most of the state lies on a plateau, bordered in the
west by a coastal strip (about 30 km wide; average annual rainfall 3,000 -
3,700 mm) and the Western Ghats (low hills with altitudes of up to 1,500 m
and average annual rainfall of 2,500 mm). Average rainfall elsewhere in the
state is about 1350 mm. The State enjoys a bi-modal rainfall pattern with
the major portion of its rainfall coming from the southwest monsoon, which
starts in early June and continues till September (peak Jlne - July). There
are, however, considerable variations in both amount and distribution of
monsoon rains and as many as 135 out of 175 taluks (an administrative
sub-division of a district) are classified as "drought prone".
2.04      Land use classification and utilization: 1/  About 11.9 million ha,
equivalent to 62% of the States total area, is under cultivation (net cropped
area 9.9 million ha and fallow 2.0 million ha), of which about 1.4 million ha
are under irrigation. Some 4.2 million ha lie uncultivated (including cul-
tivable and uncultivable fallow and wastelands) and about 1.9 million ha are
not available for cultivation (for reasons of being contiguous to roads,
canal banks, railway tracks, bridges, public buildings, etc.). Of the uncul-
tivable and fallow lands, (totalling about 4.2 million ha), about 1.4 million
ha are cultivable wastes (categorized as A&B class lands) and about 2.8
million ha are barren non-cultivable lands (categorized as C&D class lands).
Most of the government owned A&B class lands have been made available to
1/ Based on 1981 census data.



-6-
villages for common use by villagers as grazing grounds (locally known as
gonal or peramboke lands).  Included in the A&B lands are about 40,000 ha of
cultivable lands, comprised of foreshores of large reservoirs and higher
reaches of derelict tank beds and which have been designated for tree plant-
ing. Finally, about 3.2 million ha are under forests which amounts to about
16% of the State's land surface. This is in contrast to the all India
average of 23% and the national policy recommendations for maintaining 33% of
total geographical area under forests.
2.05      Farm sizes. 2/  There are about 3.6 million holdings in the state
giving an average farm size of about 3.2 ha. 53% of the holdings are below 2
ha and cover only 15.5% of the cuLtivated area; at the other extreme, a
little over 6.2% of all holdings cover nearly 32% of the cultivated area.
2.06      Land tenure and tenancy laws.  Basically, there are two types of
land ownership: State-owned land and privately-owned land (which includes
land owned by individuals, by joinit families, and by legal persons -- cor-
porations, trusts, and idols). According to the 1975-76, census nearly 90%
of all holdings are wholly owned and self-operated; 5% wholly rented and
about 5% partly rented. The Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961, provides for
security of tenancy, limits the amount of land holdings by individuals, legal
persons or families and allows for redistribution of lands among the landless
and persons belonging to scheduled castes/tribes.
2.07      Under the Land Grant Rules, 1969, the Revenue Officers (i.e, Tah-
sildars, Assistant Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and the Revenue
Secretary) can grant surplus government-owned lands to individuals. Lands
granted under the Land Reforms Act: or the Land Grant Rules can only be used
for the purpose for which they were let, leased or transferred. For
instance, gomal lands can only be used for grazing. The planting of trees,
and even fodder grasses, amounts to a change in use. An application can,
however, be made to the Deputy Cormmissioner -- the chief revenue officer of a
district -- to authorize the change in land use. From this point of view,
therefore, there is no legal obstacle to the use of gomal lands for planting
trees or grasses (para 3.08).
Fuelwood and Fodder Situation
2.08      There is a growing shortage of firewood, small timber for con-
structing dwellings and for making agricultural implements, and of fodder.
Such shortages are more acute in the semi-urban and urban areas and in the
drier districts of the State. Per capita availability of firewood is
estimated at about 60% of total requirements and the State is annually some
1 million m3 short in supply. Available fodder from arable and non-arable
2/ 1976-77 agricultural census.



-7-
lands and forest areas are estimated to be about 5 million tons of dry matter
equivalent, which is sufficient only for maintaining the existing livestock
population at survival and low performance levels.
2.09      The undesirable consequences of the adverse fuelwood and fodder
balance have been well documented. 1/ An average rural family spends about
10% of its daily labor on firewood collection and 26% on livestock tending
(including collection of fodder) compared to less than 20%' on agricultural
activities. Similarly, nearly 12% of the daily calories expended is spent on
firewood gathering, 24% on livestock tending compared to about 23% on
agricultural activities.
Rural Institutions
2.10      Panchayat System:  Karnataka Village Panchayats and Local Boards
Act, 1959, provides for a three tier system of panchayats (elective corporate
bodies) within the Department of Rural Development, Cooperation and
Panchayats. At the lowest level are the Village Panchayats, each covering on
an average three revenue villages and about 3,200 persons, elected by all
the adult members residing in a village or group of villages and who are
listed on the Legislative Assembly electoral roll. There are 8,249 village
panchayats. At the intermediate level are the Taluk Development Boards (TDB)
which correspond, territorially, to a revenue taluk. These bodies comprise
directly elected members, co-opted, and ex-officio members. The District
Development Council (DDC) is at the apex of the system, each corresponding,
territorially, to a revenue district.
2.11      Functions.  Village panchayats, TDBs and DDCs can undertake a wide
range of functions, some of which relate to forestry development. For
instance, village panchayats are responsible for the "planting and preserv-
ation of trees"; the management and maintenance of forests adjacent to the
villages, as well as the management of waste lands, pasture lands or vacant
lands belonging to the government situated within the village; and the main-
tenance of "grazing lands and forest lands vesting in or under the control of
the Panchayat." Among the obligatory functions which TDB have are the "plant-
ing and preservation of trees on the sides of roads and other public grounds
under its control." Further, in 1982, Taluka Level Forestry Committees on
Social Forestry (TLFC) were constituted for every taluk. These committees,
with an initial life of two years, comprise members of the TDB, and other
officials at the Taluka level. The primary purpose of these comnittees is
the encouragement and supervision of social forestry schenes within each
taluk.

1% as village and private forests while the remaining 14% are unclassified.
About 50% of the total growing stock of 216 million m3 is to be found in the
high rainfall evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (15% of total forest
area), 26% in the moist deciduous (15% of forest area) and 17% in dry
deciduous (19% of forest area) forests, while the remaining 7% comprise scrub
and thorny bushes (covering 21% of forest area) found in the eastern and
north-eastern dry zones of the State. About 30% of the designated forest
area has little or no tree cover and, hence, is void of any growing stock.
Within the State, there is a wide variation in the location of forest area.
2.13      Forest Produce and Its lJtilization.  Total recorded production of
roundwood, sawn lumber, poles and other construction timber and firewood
amount to about 2.5 million m3 per year (average of 1978-81) of which nearly
1.4 million m3 are firewood. The State also produces about 1.4 million tons
of bamboo. In reality, however, a much larger quantity is extracted from the
existing forests as the official estimate does not include the substantial
quantity of wood illegally removed from forest areas. Round timber of com-
mercial importance, both hard and softwood species, are sold to the public
through 36 government timber depots. In respect of softwood, pulpwood and
bamboo, specific areas in existing government forests are leased to
industries for extraction. There are some 88 firewood depots, 34 run by the
Karnataka State Forest Department (and KSFD, para 2.17) and 54 by the Kar-
nataka State Forest Industries Corporation (KSFIC) from which firewood is
sold to consumers in the urban and semi-urban areas. KSFD also runs 37
depots specifically for supplying green bamboo, seeds, etc. to members of the
scheduled caste and scheduled tribes (para 2.01), who depend heavily on
handicrafts made of such raw materials for their livelihood.
2.14      GOK Objectives, Policies and Commitment for Sector Development.
Government data on the output of forest produce over recent years shows that
current production in 1980-81 was about 30% lower than the State's average
annual production during the period 1978-80. It is estimated that to correct
the present imbalance, annual plantings of about 95,000 ha per year would be
required and, in order to achieve this objective, GOK has initiated the
following program:
(a)  mobilization of the State's own resources in order to ensure
increased outlay for plantation development;
(b) enforcement of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act of 1976 (see
para 2.17) thereby regulating indiscriminate felling of trees on
private lands by individuals;



-9-
(c) afforestation on public lands that are not available for cultiva-
tion of annual/seasonal crops;
(d) provision of incentives to private individuals for tree planting;
and
(e) accelerated afforestation of drought prone areas (DPA) through soil
conservation programs, etc. to halt the overall deterioration of
the ecology.
2.15      Karnataka was the first State to introduce, in 1975, a forest
development tax (5% ad valorem) on all sales of forest produce. The rate has
since been increased to 8%. The proceeds from this tax, currently estimated
at over Rs 20 million, are available only for the developTment of forestry
activities and have provided crucial financial support for most on-going
social forestry activities (para 2.21 and 2.22). The proposed allocations of
Rs 160 million in the Sixth Five Year Plan to the forestry sector represent
substantial increases over previous Plan allocations of Rs 10.5 million in
the Second Plan, Rs 40 million in the Third Plan, Rs 50.2 million in the
Fourth Plan and Rs 70.2 million in the current (i.e., Fifth) Plan period.
2.16      Legal Basis for Forestry Development.  Two pieces of legislation
-- the 1lysore Forest Act, 1963 and the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act,
1976, along with the pertinent Rules framed under those Acts -- provide the
legal framework for the creation, management, protection and exploitation of
forests on public communal and private lands. The Act of 1976, provides for
setting up of Tree Authorities in rural and urban areas to create woodlots
(defined as any piece of land on which trees form the main crop by virtue
of having at least 25 trees in each ha) and regulate the felling of trees
(no individual can fell a tree on his or on occupied land without prior
permission of the Tree Officers designated for each area).
Forestry Institutions
2.17      The Karnataka State Forest Department (KSFD) is an entity within
the Department of Agriculture and Cooperatives and responsible to the
Secretary, Food and Forests Department. KSFD has two operational wings,
General and Development, each headed by a Chief Conservator of Forests (CCF).
The General Wing is responsible for undertaking all tasks relevant to tradi-
tional forest management in forest reserves and other designated forest
areas. The Development Wing, which was created in 1981, has responsibility
for working plan development, forestry research, wild life preservation,
survey and demarcation of State forests and other revenue lands transferred
to KSFD for afforestation and, more importantly, implementation of social
forestry programs. The State is divided into 7 territorial circles, each
headed by a Conservator of Forests (CF). Next in line are the Forest Divi-
sions, each headed by a Divisional Conservator of Forests (DCF), assisted by
about two or three Assistant Conservators of Forests (ACF). There are



-10-
presently 35 such Divisions. Within each Division there are Range Offices,
which generally coincide with the administrative boundaries of a Taluka, and
these are headed by Range Forest Officers (RFO). There are 466 RFOs in the
State who are supported by some 1,500 Foresters. About 4,000 Beat Guards are
employed to protect plantations and forests.  E'SFD organization, staffing
pattern and staff background, training and orientation are based on the
philosophy and concept of traditional forest management and protection and
hence are not geared towards prov!ding extension and advisory services to
individuals.
2.18      Silviculture Research. 1/  The State has a generally satisfactory
research infrastructure with a research unit at Bangalore headed by a Conser-
vator of Forests and three regional silviculturalists (DCF) stationed at
Bangalore, Dharwad and Hlercara to cover the wet, intermediate and dry zones.
These stations also have seed tesl:ing laboratories. The TJniversity of
Agricultural Sciences at Bangalore has a small Farm Forestry Department which
also undertakes silvicultural research. Additionally, the Central Wood
Research Technological Institute and the Indian Institute of Science, both
located in Bangalore, are also capable of carrying out silviculture research.
While much of KSFD's ongoing research has overall relevance to development
of social forestry, there is a need to focus the program more narrowly
towards the problems of social forestry and concentrate on a few priority
areas such as species and provenance trials, agro-forestry and intercropping,
nursery techniques etc. (para 3.36). Additionally, there is a need to estab-
lish systematic and more effective links and collaboration between KSFD, the
FRI in Dehra Dun and other state and regional forestry research institutions.
2.19      Training.  2/ Most of the senior professional staff, (RFO and
above), are now trained at the GO]: Forest Trairting Institute at Dehra Dun and
some at Coimbatore. The state has a training school for Foresters at Dhar-
wad, which provides a 15-month course and has an annual output of 50.  There
are two facilities at Bidar and Karhangar for the training of forest guards
which offer six months long programs and have a combined annual throughput of
240.
2.20      Seedling Nurseries.  KSFD maintains some 600 nurseries located
throughout the State.  Although on an average one nursery serves about 45
villages, the spread is not even and there is a heed for increased coverage,
particularly in the drier districts. Currently, large nunbers of seedlings
(over 100 million annually) of some 30 differentt species are raised.
However, Eucalyptus tereticornes, which enjoys the greatest demand from the
1/ February 1983 IDA Forestry Sub-sector Revi(ew (para 1.06).
2/ The February 1983 IDA Forestry Sub-Sector Review included among other
things, a review of forestry t:raining in India (para 1.06).



-11-
public, accounts for more than 50% of seedlings raised. Few, if any, nur-
series are presently run by the private sector.
2.21      Social Forestry Plantations.  KSFD began a modest program of tree
planting outside its traditional domain, the forest reserves, in 1979/80.
This was in response partly to the critical fuelwood and fodder shortage
prevailing in the State (paras 2.08, 2.09) and, partly to the policy direc-
tives of GOI following recommendations of the National Conmission for
Agriculture (paras 1.04-1.05). Since inception of the program, KSFD has
spent about Rs 81 M, as of December 1981, on social forestry plantings,
details of which are given below. 1/ A sum of Rs 121 million has been allo-
cated for the proposed 1983-84 program:

2.22      The present social forestry program is heavily concentrated on
plantings on government revenue lands by KSFD, including some that have been
transferred for communal use. There is very little participation by local
people and communities, even when plantations are on communal lands. KSFD
does not have a separate organization for implementing the program, and all
social forestry programs are now undertaken by the existing territorial staff
in addition to their normal duties, i.e., traditional forest management.
Consequently, the program is implemented on a somewhat ad hoc basis, no
systematic extension program exists and relevant staff are not adequately
trained for providing advisory services.
1/ Includes allocations under State Plan only. In addition, funds were also
provided from Forest Development Fund, and by GOI under several centrally
sponsored schemes.

III THE PROJECT
A. General
Project Objectives, Rationale and Strategy
3.01      The primary objective would be to increase supplies of fuelwood
to rural and semi-urban areas through the esta'blishment of some 150,000 ha
of plantations located throughout the State. Secondary objectives would be
to provide small timber, livestoclk fodder, fruit, bamboo for cottage industry
and other minor forest and agricu:Ltural products. In order to carry out this
program, the project would provide additional vehicles, housing, equipment
and forestry staff and improve existing staff training, silvicultural
research and forestry extension activities. Although the project would cover
the entire State, priority for tree establishment would be in those districts
which fulfill at least two of the following three conditions: (a) mean
annual rainfall below 800 mm; (b) designated forest area less than 15% of
total geographic area; and (c) moze than nine rural based persons per ha of             I
presently designated forest area. Based on these criteria there would be 13
priority districts 1/ having a total rural population of 20 million and
comprising over 19,550 villages and 130 Talukas (Annex 1).  Detailed dis-
trict-wise annual targets for all tree planting components (para 3.02) were
agreed during negotiations.
3.02      Over the five year project period, the proposed project would:
(a) Establish plantations on:
(i)  about 20,000 ha of government owned gomal lands and
agriculturally unproductive (C & D class) public waste
lands (also see para 3.05);
(ii)  3,000 ha of foreshores of irrigation tanks and
(iii)  4,000 ha of strip plantation along roadsides (3,000 ha)
and canal banks (1,000 ha);
(b) Establish 2,000 ha of bamboo plantations in forest areas as a
source of material for cottage industry;
1/ Bangalore, Belgaum, Bellary, Bidar, Bijapur, Chitradurga, Dharwad,
Gulbarga, Kolar, M4ysore, Mandya, Raichur and Takmur.



-13-
(c) Establish 120,000 ha of forestry on private farm land through
development of additional nurseries, distribution of planting
material and provision of advisory services;
(d)  Provide forestry staff, vehicles, equipment, housing, offices and
incremental operating costs in support of plantation development
including publicity and project monitoring;
(e) Strengthen research through provision of additional staff and funds
for contract research;
(f) Develop staff training through increased in-service training,
inproved facilities and provision of fellowships; and
(g) Carry out a wood balance study and short-term studies related to
issues arising out of project implementation.
3.03      In arriving at project design the following points have been taken
into account and would form the guiding principles in project implementation:
(a) Land of minimal agricultural potential would be planted to trees;
(b) Farmers would be encouraged not to plant on lands that have a
potential for production of subsistence crops and to intercrop
trees with food crops, wherever possible (also see para 3.17);
(c) Emphasis would be placed on those activities that err!ourage com-
munal participation and create employment opportunities for the
rural poor and the unemployed;
(d) Project output would be first made available to meet the needs of
the area in which development takes place; priority in its dis-
tribution would be for the rural landless, marginal farmers and
other disadvantaged sections of the population;
(e) Development costs would be recovered wherever possible; and
(f)  Full participation of local communities would be sought in carrying
out project actions.
3.04    Project Phasing.  The proposed planting program is as follows:

3.05       As it is not possible to predict with,- certainty the response of
farmers and Panchayats to the alternative approaches suggested above,
flexibility would be maintained duiring project implementation and would allow
shifting from one category of planiting to anot'her according to results. This
would be accomplished by monitorinlg of results by the Monitoring and Evalua-
tion Cell (MEFG) (para 5.08), and by a mid-term review to be held after com-
pletion of the third year's tree planting. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that Karnataka would undertake a joint review of the project
with GOI and IDA no later than Ma-rch 31, 1986.
B. Detailed Features
3.06       All six categories of p!Lantations (i.e. those on gomal lands,
agricultural wastelands, tank foreashores, canal banks and roadsides, bamboo
plots in reserved forests and on private land) have differing conceptual,
establishmient, management, harvest:ing, marketing, legal and financial fea-
tures which distinguish them from one another. To meet the various needs of
end use and to accommodate the varying climatic and soil conditions found



-15-
throughout the State, it has been necessary to develop eight plantation
models. Details of each category and the plantation model associated with
its development are summarized in the following paragraphs.
Plantations established by KSFD (23,000 ha representing 15% of total planting
program)
3.07    Plantation on gomal lands (Model I; 15,000 ha representing 10% of
total planting program). According to official estimates, some 600,000 ha of
gomal lands (owned and managed by the Revenue Department but made available
to communities for grazing purposes) are at the disposal of the Government.
Proposed plantings would involve only about 2.5% of all such available land
and, hence, there should be no difficulty in finding the required lands for
this purpose. The Social Forestry Wing (SFW) (para 5.01) of KSFD would
establish these plantations and would bear the cost of planting as well as
the cost of maintenance and protection for the subsequent two years. There-
after managemenitand protection would be the responsibility of the village
Panchayat.
3.08      Plantations on gomal lands, however, would involve using land for
purposes other than for which they have been set aside (i.e., grazing) and,
hence, permission would be required from the land revenue authority and the
panchayats to change the use. Mloreover, since such planting would involve
temporary closure of gomal land, at least for the first three years after
establishment, this could affect the availability of land for grazing and
fodder in the area. In view of this, assurances were obtained at nego-
tiations that: (a) KSFD would ensure that aggregate fodder supplies would
not be adversely affected by closure of the gomal lands on which plantations
would be established; (b) identification of gomal land (and its extent) to be
planted and of species to be planted would be done in full agreement with the
respective Panchayats and concerned villagers; (c) once such agreements had
been reached, the Deputy Commissioner would authorize tree plantation on
gomal lands in accordance with Karnataka State laws.
3.09      Plantations on C&D Class Lands (Mlodel II; 5,000 ha representing
3% of total planting program). 5,000 ha of C&D class lands, out of some
300,000 ha transferred to the KSFD for management, control and afforestation
(para 2.04) would be planted with fodder, fuel, fruit and small timber
species, or bamboo (in wet zones). These plantations would be developed as
village forests, and hence would be sited on lands as close to vil-
lages/tribal settlements as possible. Costs of planting, maintenance and
protection would be borne by KSFD, who would employ, for such purposes, the
landless laborers, marginal farmers and members of other disadvantaged sec-
tions of the population (according to the principles now being followed in
determining beneficiaries under the IRDP programs) living in the neighboring
villages. Land preparation would generally be by labor but on certain lands,
due to poor soil types and terrain, use of heavy machinery would be necessary
(paras 3.20-3.21). Wlherever possible, all or portions of such plantation



-16-
blocks would be earmarked for maintenance and protection by the poorer sec-
tions of the community in return for a specified share of the produce (para
5.13).
3.10    Assurances were obtained during negotiations that up to the mid-tern
review (para 3.05) plantations on gomal lands would not exceed 8,000 ha and
those on C & D lands 5,000 ha, oul: of the 20,000 ha of agriculturally
unproductive wasteland to be pianted under the project.
3.11    Plantations on Tank Foreshores and Upp(er Reaches of Derelict Tank
Beds: (Model III; 3,000 ha representing 2% of total planting). Karnataka
has several irrigation reservoirs, the upper resaches of whose foreshores
remain submerged for about 1/10 of the year. Furthermore, nearly 50% of the
gtate's 28,000 minor irrigation tanks are known to have silted up resulting
in dry (or partly submerged) foreshore areas. Such lands, which are
estimated to cover about 40,000 ha, would be suitable for planting of certain
tree species, particularly those that are capable of growing on clay and wet
soils and could withstand brief pe!riods of inundation. The pro~posed project
would develop about 3,000 ha of such lands.
3.12    Assurances were obtained during negotiations that establishment of
plantations on C & D class lands, on tank foreshores and on tank beds (paras
3.09, 3.11) would be the responsibility of KSFD and that its later manage-
nent, including usage, would be governed by an agreement between KSFD and
concerned village panchayats.
Strip Plantations by KSFD (4,000 acres representing 2.7% of total plantings).
3.13    Plantations on Canal Banks (MIodel IV; 1,000 ha representing less than
0.7% of total planting). The total length of canal banks in Karnataka is
about 4,500 km. Depending on whether the cana:Ls are main, branch or dis-
tributory, strips of land between 10-20 rm wide are available on both sides of
canals, some of which would be suitable for planting of trees. The proposed
project would plant up 1,000 ha of land covering some 800-900 km length of
canal banks. Plantations would be in 150-200 ha blocks, in four row strips
(on an average) and at 2m x 2m spaLcing. Wherever possible, the strips would
be undersown with herbaceous fodder and legumes. All plantation costs and
maintenance costs for the first three years would be borne by KSFD.  Site
selection, plantation design and techniques would be in consultation with the
Irrigation Department.
3.14    Strip Plantations on Roadsides -- Dry Zones: (Model V; 2,500 ha
representing 1.7% of total plantings). In areas where annual rainfall is
less than 650 mm, avenue plantations equivalent to about 2,500 trees/ha,
would be established. Two rows would be planted on each side of the road,
the spacing between plants and rows being 9m and 3m, respectively. Each km
length of road would thus be plant;ed with some 475 plants, corresponding to
about 1-2 ha of intensive planting. Species that are hardy, drought



-17-
tolerant, permanent and have value as ornamental, shade, fuel, timber and
fruit would be planted.
3.15    Strip Plantations on Roadsides -- Moist Zones (MIodel VI; 500 ha
representing 0.3% of total plantings). In areas where rainfall is between
650 mm and 1,000 mm, some 420 kms of roadsides, equivalent to about 500 ha,
would be planted with a mixture of fast-growing fuelwood species and per-
manent fruit and avenue trees. Some 1,330 trees would be planted per km
length, which would correspond to intensive plantation on about 1.3 ha at a
spacing of 3 m x 3 m.
3.16    Bamboo Plantations for Tribal People (Model VII; 2,000 ha repre-
senting 1.3 % of total plantings).   Some 700,000 tribal people live in
forest areas and are part of the forest ecosystem (para 2.01). Bamboo
provides one of the important raw materials for the manufacture of tradi-
tional crafts. The proposed project would plant 2,000 ha of bamboo specifi-
cally for the benefit of tribal groups. Bamboo clumps (177 per ha in 7.5 m x
7.5 m spacings) of different species, suitable to the particular ecological
and edaphic conditions, would be planted. Suitable Government owned forest
areas or other lands would be selected as far as possible in the vicinity of
the tribal colonies. 1/ The tribals living in the vicinity of the selected
areas would be employed in the operations of raising the plantations, i.e.,
soil preparation, plantings and subsequent cultural operations and they would
be paid wages by the KSFD for the work done by them. They would be also
employed to watch and guard the plantations until they become mature for
harvesting. lWherever feasible tribal associations/cooperatives would be
formed by the KSFD and the harvested bamboos released to the members of such
associations/cooperatives at rates 25%-50% less than the current schedule of
rates for sale of bamboos from regular forest areas. The Taluk Level Forest
Advisory Committees would review the demand of bamboos from the tribals of
the areas and ensure that their demands are fully met before the surplus
material is sold to other cottage industries.
1/ The following districts were tentatively identified during negotiations:
Mlysore (200 ha); Bangalore (200 ha); Dharwad (300 ha); N. Kanara (300
ha); Belgaum (300 ha); Shinoga (400 ha); Chikmaglur (300 ha).

3.17    Farm Forestry (Mlodel VIII; Plantation on 120,000 ha representing 80%
of total plantings) 1/ The KSFD would raise and distribute 600 million seed-
lings of a wide variety of fuel, fodder, small timber, poles and fruit tree
species for plantations by private individuals, mostly farmers. lIost Kar-
nataka farmers currently practice high density plantings (up to 10,000 per ha
in some wet areas) with a view to maximizing biomass production.
Cost-benefit ratios of high density plantings beyond a certain level are not
known. Stand density trials would therefore be initiated as part of the
silviculture research program under the project and in the meantime the
maximum number of trees that would be recommended for farm forestry would be
5,000 per ha (2,500 where intercropping/undercropping would be done). The
forestry extension staff, with the help of agricultural extension staff,
would help farmers in site selection, keeping in view the guiding principles
contained in para 3.03 (a) and (b).
3.18    Seedlings would be raised primarily in KSFD nurseries, but incentives
would be given for the development of nurseries by private individuals, and
by local institutions such as schools, cooperatives, religious entities, etc.
In order to reduce transportation and transit damage, the existing nursery
network would be expanded, particuLarly in drier areas.  The long term objec-
tive would be to create nurseries to serve groups of 8-10 villages with KSFD
maintaining larger regional/district nurseries for the needs of large block
and strip plantings, and for conducting research and plant introduction
activities. GOK has prepared a detailed nursery development plan showing,
inter alia, the proposed spatial dLstribution of future KSFD nurseries,
measures for promoting private nursery development and for improvements in
nursery and seedling distribution/handling techniques. Inplementation of
this program would start prior to the 1984-85 planting season.
3.19    It has been agreed with GOl and GOI that the present policy of free
distribution of seedlings in unlimited quantities would be changed in the
interest of equity, cost recovery, increased privatization of nurseries and
efficiency in seedling use. It is estimated that an average farm family
would require approximately 750 trees in order to meet its needs for fuelwood
and fodder. Accordingly, up to 750 seedlings (including losses) would be
given free of charge to each family during the project period and quantities
above this limit would be charged at the actual financial cost of production
in KSFD nurseries, which currently is estimated at 30 paise per seedling.
1/   Three sub-categories under thLs model have been assumed:  (a) on rainfed
croplands (84,000 ha) where currently minor grains such as ragi are
grown; (b) on rainfed marginal lands (30,000 ha) including areas with
poor soils, difficult terrain and those around homestead, field bunds,
etc., and hence, without any crop potentials, and (c) marginal wet lands
(6,000 ha) including swamps, marshy and seasonally inundated low lying
areas when no crops are currectly grown.



-19-
However, germinated seedlings in baskets and/or seeds would be supplied free
of charge. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that during the
1984-85 planting season, the limit for the distribution of tree seedlings
would be 1,500 per family and the project proposal for restricting free
distribution to 750 seedlings per family would be effective from the 1985-86
planting season.
Plantation Techniques
3.20    Site Preparation.  Except on hard compacted soils, especially on C&D
lands and some gomal areas where mechanical ripping and ploughing would be
necessary (para 3.21), land and site preparation would be done by hand labor.
Pitting and/or trenching, which are well established methods, would be used
for most species, including Eucalyptus.
3.21    Although mechanical ripping and/or ploughing has been used by KSFD
(mostly with equipment hired from Agro-Industries Corporation) for some
plantations on gomal and C & D lands, the technical, economic, and silvicul-
tural advantages of such practices have not been fully demonstrated.
Specifications for ripping--depth, spacing, follow-up ridging etc.--have also
not been standardized nor based on satisfactory studies/trials. More impor-
tantly, large scale use of heavy machinery for social forestry plantation,
particularly on communal lands, is not desirable because it would hinder
community participation as well as employment generation. Assurances, there-
fore, were obtained at negotiation that:
(a) Mechanical ripping and ploughing would be limited to C&D lands and
under some exceptional circumstances on gomal land and which are
either lateritic or compacted soils and which make manual land
preparation costly; and
(b) Such lands would only be selected if better sites were not avail-
able.
Plantation Establishment
3.22    In order to improve survival rates and tree growth, KSFD would take
measures to improve nursery practices, planting methods and handling and
transportation of seedlings. Such measures would include: (a) Elimination
of the long delays that now occur between moving the plants from the nursery
and actual planting in the field, (b) Discarding seedlings that do not
strictly conform to established quality specifications, (c) Raising seedlings
in polytubes, and effecting proper root pruning with a view to promoting
better and more fibrous root systems and (d) Reducing handling and transpor-
tation damage.
3.23    Direct sowing is not common but has been partially successful in some
areas where seed of Eucalyptus citridora was sown on the spoils of trenches.



-20-
Properly done, and where good quality seed is cheap and easily available,
this would be an effective method of plantation establishment, Direct
sowing, therefore, would be done on those gomal and C & D lands where
trenches would be used for planting of seedlings.
3.24    Weeding, Fertilizing, Watering and Fire Protection.  For most of the
plantation models, weeding for the first three years (except for tank fore-
shores, canal banks and bamboo models where weeding would be only for the
first two years)--once after the rains and a number of times thereafter---
would be necessary for ensuring proper sapling growth. Herbacious fodder
and/or legumes, which would be undersown in some plantations, would need to
be harvested in a timely manner. In the context of social forestry projects,
grass, fodder and other forageable vegetation are regularly collected by
villagers for feeding their cattle and, therefore, weeding on project planta-
tions should not involve any substantial resource commitment from the
Forestry Department.
3.25    Chemical fertilizers (mainly urea) and some dung are now sporadically
used in KSFD plantations as well as by some farmers. The current recommenda-
tion of using 5 g of urea per sappling planted is not based on any systematic
trials. In the absence of any meaningful data on the optimum amount and type
of fertilizer that should be used on the different species of trees and on
different types of soils, no recommendations for fertilizer use have been
made. However, farm yard manure would be used as a conditioner to the soil
in the pits for plantings on roadsides and canal banks.
3.26    All the proposed models are based on non-irrigated and semi-arid
conditions. However hand waterings of all species on road and canal sites,
on gomal and C&D lands, particularly of those in the dry areas and during the
dry seasons, would be done during the first two years following estab-
lishment.
3.27    Protection.  All plantations require protection against insect attack
(particularly for eucalyptus, fruit trees, and some other species that are
vulnerable to ant and termite infestations), grazing and fire. Fire protec-
tion by fire lines or fire traces is standard practice in KSFD production
plantations but in social forestry most flammable vegetation would be removed
by villagers (para 3.24). Fire protection is therefore included as part of
weeding, for the first three years on gomal and C&D lands, until the planta-
tions are, by law, opened to village herds when all grown vegetation would be
grazed. Insecticides would be used on all plantations except on tank fore-
shores (model III) and canal banks (model IV). 1/ Protection of plants would
1/ BHC and/or Sevin would be used to control termites on seedlings. Alter-
natively, Aldrin could be used for treating soil in pits against such
infestations. Application would be at a very low dose - 0.2 liter per
2,500 plants and hence would not pose any environmental hazards.



-21-
by way of constructing cattle proof trenches on the perimeter of block plan-
tations on gomal and C&D lands. W4herever necessary, brushwood fences of
local materials would be constructed. In strip plantations some individual
tree protectors, using local materials would be used. In addition, KSFD (or
the Panchayats) would employ watchmen for this purpose. Protection against
physical damage should, however, be provided by the respective communities
who are expected to be the beneficiaries and as such KSFD would work through
its extension staff to generate community cooperation in this respect.
Species Mix and Plantation Design
3.28    The species mix for each model is based on their suitability to
prevailing agro-ecological conditions in the locality, anticipated output in
terms of yields, simplicity of management requirements, and established
preferences of the rural population. Overall 95% of the species planted
would produce fuelwood and/or small timber, poles and softwood. Many of the
recommended species also produce good leaf fodder. Wherever possible, plan-
tations would be undersown with herbaceous legumes and grasses, while produc-
tion of naturally occurring grasses, particularly on gomal and C&D lands and
tank foreshores, would be enhanced by the protection of the plantation.
3.29    Fuelwood and/or small timber, poles and fodder yielding species (e.g.
Acacia nilotica, A. tortillis and A. auriculiformi; Casuarina equiselificia;
Leucaena leucocephalia; Prosopis juliflora, etc.) would constitute over 65%
of all trees planted on gomal lands, 45% on C&D lands, 95% on tank foreshores
and 40% on canal banks. Overall, nearly 55% of all trees planted on public
lands would be of the above species, 38% Eucalyptus sps, 5% fruit trees and
the remaining 2% would be bamboo and miscellaneous avenue trees.
3.30    In farm forestry, nearly 92% of all trees planted is likely to be
Eucalyptus teretecornis, which is a fast growing tree that has a ready market
for pulpwood, fuel, poles and even for sawn wood. On many poorer soils,
particularly in the drier areas, where traditional grain crops provide unat-
tractive returns, planting Eucalyptus sps has proven to be a lucrative alter-
native and, in fact, has assumed the position of a cash crop in many areas.
Nevertheless, Eucalyptus sps are also known to have some important drawbacks
in that they do not lend themselves well to intercropping, are competitive,
consume large volumes of water, have no value as fodder, and, because of its
value as an industrial raw material, part of the produce nay not reach the
firewood market. In view of the above, the KSFD would:
(a) Adequately publicize the benefits and drawbacks of planting
cropland with Eucalyptus sps;
(b) Explore viable alternatives to Eucalyptus that would have its
attractive characteristics, but not the obvious drawbacks;



-22-
(c) Intensify research on new species and provenances of Eucalyptus
that would be more suitable for social forestry; and
(d) Closely monitor the social, economic and agronomic effects of large
scale afforestation with Eucalyptus.
Implementation Assistance to KSFD
3.31    Incremental Staff (Base Cost Rs 83.2 Million).  The proposed project
would provide incremental staff for the establishment of a Social Forestry
Unit (SFU) within the existing structure of KSFD (para 5.01). This would
include recruitment of technical, professional, administrative, and other
support staff of all levels for the headquarters, circle offices, district
offices, and field services, staff training, and project monitoring and
evaluation. It would also provide additional staff (2 ACFs, 6 RFOs, 5
laboratory assistants and a soil scientist) to KSFD for strengthening social
forestry related silvicultural research, with particular emphasis on species
and provenance work. Given below are details cf the technical, administra-
tive, professional and support staff that would be appointed under the
project (Annex 5, Table 3).

Base Cost (Rs 21.3 Million). The SFU would be provided with 2 bulldozers
with rippers, 34 tractor-trailers, 17 water tankers, 46 jeeps, 150 motor-
cycles, 2 bicycles, and some 16 passenger vehicles (cars, vans, etc.).
Equipment to be provided would include the usual office equipment (e.g.,
typewriters, calculators, copying machines, etc.), as well as field equipment
such as pump sets and sprayers. Furniture would be provided for offices and
the training centers (details in Annex 5, Table 5). Costs of operating and
maintaining vehicles and equipment, office expenditures, and building main-
tenance would also be provided (details in Annex 5, Table 4).
3.33    Civil Works (Base Cost Rs 25.5M).  The project would finance con-
struction of a training center at Dharwad for foresters and forest extension
workers within the existing Campus of the State's Forest training Centre at
Dharwad (9000 sq ft), including contribution of dormitories and expansion of
existing training facilities.   Additionally, offices for additional CCF
(SFU) and DCFs (SFU), 13 residential houses for senior professional staff,
and 246 for RFOs, Foresters, and FEWs would also be constructed. These would
meet only partial requirements of staff housing, particularly of the lower
level field staff. Construction of a new forestry extension school would
also be financed. All buildings would be of standard public works department
design and specifications, and would have approximately the following floor
areas (in sq ft): CCF: 2,000; DCF: 1,500; SCF: 1,200; RFO: 800; Foresters:
600; FEW: 400. Other civil works under the project would include construc-
tion of seed testing laboratories, storage, pump houses, garages, etc, for
which a sum of Rs 3.5 million would be provided.
3.34    Staff Development (Base Cost Rs 7.6 Million).  All Staff on first
appointment, or on transfer from territorial duties to SFU would be given
orientation training with particular emphasis on farm forestry and extension.
This would be followed by short duration in-service training administered as
appropriate within the state, out of state, as well as out of the country.
The school at Dharwad would liaise closely with the State Agricultural
University's Farmer's Training Center nearby, including the use of their
facilities and staff, if so required. The following provides an outline of a
suggested training program.
(a) Forest Officers (Other than ACF): Senior officers would be sent
to overseas institutions 1/ for short duration higher level
courses covering subjects such as social and community forestry
(including topics covering sociological, silvicultural,

(b)  ACF.  Five officers wouLd be sent every year to Dehra Dun to
attend the recently introduced 6-month course in Social and
Community Forestry (150 man-months);
(c)  Range Forest Officers.  One hundred and eighty would be given
two weeks in-service training (in batches of 20) at Dharwad (90
man-months);
(d)  Foresters.  One day orientation training/seminars every month
would be given at the district level by the respective DCF or
ACF. All foresters would be covered by this training;
(e)  Forest Extension Workers:  All Forest Extension Workers (394)
would be given eight weeks training at Dharwad in groups of
30-35; additionally, regular monthly training sessions would
be held in the districts;
(f)  Motivators.  These part-time village level workers would be
given two-three weeks oE training at the district headquarters
in groups of 30, followed by monthly one-day refresher training
at the Taluka headquarters.
3.35    All in-state training would be conducted according to the historic
and currently followed "officers and men" model, with State Forest Officers
and Rangers providing in-service training to their subordinates. Hence, no
additional trainers/instructors would be necessary. However, the project
would provide for an ACF, supported 'by three Rangers, at headquarters, who
would oversee the programming and imjplementation of the project's training
activities.
3.36    Research, Studies and Consultancies (Rs 0.7 Million). Excluding
Incremental Staff). Funds would be provided to selected individuals and/or
institutions to undertake on contract social forestry-related research (sil-
vicultural, as well as socio-economic). Selection would be based on estab-
lished criteria acceptable to IDA. An outline of a suggested (silvicultural)
research program is available in the project file. during negotiations that
KSFD shall by June 30, 1984:
(a) Review its current social forestry research program and, identify
the areas of deficiency as well as the priority topics for research
under the proposed project; and
(b) Based on such review, prepare a detailed program for implementation
and furnish the same to the Association for its concurrence. If



-25-
required, KSFD would recruit out of state (country) consultants for
assistance in respect of the above, for which funds would be
provided under the project.
3.37    Funds would also be provided for hiring consultants (local and/or
expatriate, as appropriate) for conducting a wood-balance study (emphasizing
the long term supply, demand, pricing, and marketing aspects), and for
assisting KSFD in the monitoring and evaluation of the project (emphasizing
distribution of benefits and other socio-economic aspects). Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that KSFD would employ consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms and conditions of employment would be
satisfactory to the Association and who would be selected in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to the Association. During nego-
tiations the Association approved a list of local institutions from which a
final selection might be made for carrying out the proposed studies, etc.
The terms of reference for the proposed wood balance study, as outlined in
Annex 14, were discussed and agreed upon during negotiations. It was also
agreed that the study would be initiated by March 1985 and be completed by
June 1986.
IV. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT, AND DISBURSEH1ENT
Project Costs
4.01      Project costs, based on prices prevailing in January-February 1983
and updated to July 1983, are estimated at Rs 552.3 million (US$ 56.6 mil-
lion), of which Rs 32.8 million (US$3.4 million) or 6% would be direct and
indirect foreign exchange costs. Duties and taxes included in total costs
are estimated at Rs 11.0 million (US$1.1 million), equivalent to 2.0% of
total project costs. Total contingencies are estimated at Rs 98.5 million
(US$10.1 million), which is roughly about 18% of total (22% of baseline)
costs. Over 65% of total investment costs (inclusive of contingencies) would
be for the direct cost of plantation establishment; 17% for incremental
staff, 11% for capital goods and civil works, 5% for operation and main-
tenance costs, and the remaining 2% for research, studies, and staff develop-
ment. Estimated project costs are summarized in Table 4.02 (details at Annex
5, Tables 1-8). 1/
4.02    Physical contingencies, estimated at Rs 25.1 million (US$ 2.6 mil-

Proposed Financing
4.03      An IDA credit of US$27.0 million, equivalent to about 49% of total
project costs, net of taxes and duties, is proposed. The Overseas Develop-
ment Administration of UK would provide US$23 million (equivalent of UK
pounds 15 million), or 42% of net project costs (see para 4.04). GOI would
contribute the remaining US$6.6 million, or 11.7% of total (8.0% of net)
project costs. The following table summarizes the proposed financing of the
project.
Table 4.02: PROJECT FINANCING
GOI/GOK         IDA           ODA          Total
US$ million                    6.6           27.0          23.0         56.6

4.04      The proposed IDA credit would be made to GOI on standard terms and
conditions. GOI would channel the proceeds to GOK in accordance with GOI's
terms and conditions for development assistance to constituent States. ODA
financing would be from its Retrospective Term Adjustment (RTA) Funds which
in effect is equivalent to an interest-free debt relief on assistance pre-
viously provided.  GOK has allocated an amount of Rs 550 MI, including GOK,
GOI, and external funding, under the Sixth Five Year Plan for the proposed
project.
4.05      Retroactive Financing of up to US$2.8 million would be provided
to cover the following expenditures incurred after March 1, 1983: nursery
development, advance soil works for plantations, civil works related to
construction of training center, procurement of essential vehicles and equip-
ment, and incremental staff employed (transferred) on the 1984 planting
operation.
Procurement 1/
4.06      Civil Works (US$3.1 Million).  Most civil works would be small, and
simple structures widely dispersed geographically, and scattered over the

project period. As such, International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would not
be suitable and contracts would be let on the basis of local competitive
bidding (LCB), under established GOI procedures satisfactory to IDA and ODA
and/or by force account. Suitable local construction firms exist in suffi-
cient numbers to ensure adequate competition. However, snall civil works
contracts up to Rs 150,000 each and building maintenance would be carried out
through force account. Civil works contracts up to Rs 0.7 million would be
subject to post award review and those over this amount, to preaward review
by IDA. Land acquisition (US$ 0.5 million) would follow established rules
and regulations of GOK.
4.07      Vehicles, Equipment and Furniture (US$3.2 million).  Vehicles
(US$2.6 milTion), comprising small numbers ot several types, would be pur-
chased over three years and, as adequate maintenance and availability of
spare parts would be of paramount importance, this would necessitate purchase
of locally made vehicles of types already used by Government departments.
Thus procurement would be by LCB unzder existing Government procedures which
are acceptable to IDA. Equipment iand furniture (US$0.6 million), comprising
small numbers of a wide and miscellaneous range of items purchased over five
years would be purchased by LCB with bulking wherever appropriate to
facilitate this.
4.08      Direct Plantation Costs (US$37.2 MIillion).  Nearly 50% of expendi-
tures under this category would be for hired labor, 26% for materials, and
24% for transportation costs. Nursery work, including raising of seedlings,
would be carried out by force account of KSFD as competitive bidding for
small nurseries scattered all over the state would not be feasible. For KSFD
plantations, land preparation, planting and maintenance would be contracted
out to laborers on the basis of piece rates established by Public Work
Department for each work season. 1/ However, where such contracts exceed Rs
150,000 LCB would be followed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
KSFD would give priority to landless laborers, marginal farmers, members of
scheduled castes/tribes, and other disadvantaged communities when hiring
laborers. Materials such as polybags, fertilizer, insecticides, seeds,
nursery tools, etc., would be procured locally in accordance with standard
GOK competitive bidding procedures which are satisfactory to IDA. Transpor-
tation of seedlings and other nursery and plantation materials would be by
KSFD-owned vehicles and/or leased vehicles.  In the case of leased vehicles,
contracts over Rs 0.5 million would be let on the basis of LCB, for which
procedures are satisfactory to IDA.
1/ In the past, KSFD has managed to obtain laborers at 20% below the PWD
established rates.



-29-
4.09      Incremental Recurrent Costs (US$12.1 Mlillion), including salaries,
wages, vehicle and equipment operation and maintenance costs, office expen-
ses; overseas and local training costs (US$0.9 million) and costs for
research and studies (US$ 0.08 million) would not be suitable for any form of
competitive bidding.
Disbursement
4.10      The proposed IDA credit of US$27.0 million would be disbursed as
follows:
(a)  Civil works, including maintenance of buildings:  707 of total
costs;
(b)  Vehicles, equipment, and furniture:  100% of c.i.f. costs if
imported; 100% of ex-factory price if locally manufactured; or 75%
of purchase price if procured locally;
(c)  Plantation costs, including cost of raising seedlings, and labor,
transportation, and materials cost for plantation: 50% of total
costs;
(d)  Incremental staff salaries, in-country training and vehicle opera-
tion and maintenance costs; 50% of total costs;
(e)  Overseas training, research, and studies, including consultants
costs: 100% of total costs; and
4.11      The proposed ODA grant of UK pounds 15 million (equivalent to
US$23.0 million) would be disbursed as follows:
(a)  Civil Works including building maintenance:  25% of all costs;
(b)  Plantation costs:  50% of total costs; and
(c)  Incremental staff salaries, etc.  45% of total costs.
4.12      Disbursements against expenditures for the following items would be
against statements of expenditures certified by the CCF (Development), the
documentation for which would not be submitted to IDA/ODA for review but
would be retained by KSFD/GOK and made available to IDA/ODA review missions
for their inspection: (a) staff salaries operating costs, local training and
plantation costs, (b) civil works contract not exceeding Rs. 300,000 and
those carried under force account; (c) locally procured vehicles, equipment
and furniture costing Rs. 150,000 or less, (d) research, studies and local
consultant costs. Disbursement against all other items and excluding the
above would be contingent upon full and satisfactory docunentation. All
disbursement applications would be submitted to IDA and ODA through the



-30-
Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the GOI. Assurances covering the
above were obtained during negotiations.
4.13      The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA credit
is at Annex5 , Table 9. This has been based on the disbursement records for
ongoing IDA-financed Social Forestry Projects in. India, which have been
quicker disbursing than other IDA-financed agricultural projects in India.
Accounts and Audit
4.14      Assurances were obtained at negotiaticns that KSFD would maintain
separate accounts for all project expenditures, categorized by each com-
ponent. Such accounts and certified statements of expenditures (para 4.12)
would be audited annually by government or private auditing firm satisfactory
to IDA, in accordance with sound auditing principles consistently applied,
and submitted to IDA and ODA within nine months after the end of each fiscal
year. The final audited accounts and statements of expenditures would
provide a statement that the project funds were used for the purpose
intended, that all goods had been received and/cr services rendered, that
such goods and services were not utilized for any non-project activities, and
that full payments had been made.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
KSFD Organization
5.01      The Development Wing of KSFD has respc,nsibility for implementing
social forestry programs in the State (para 2.21.), and the proposed project
would be implemented under the overall supervision and guidance of the Chief
Conservator of Forests in charge of this Wing. A Social Forestry Wing (SFW)
headed by an Additional Chief Conservator of Forests, has been created within
the Development Wing for the implementation of the proposed project and also
for continuing activities during post project years.
5.02      Below the headquarters level, project implementation would be
overseen and coordinated by Circle Conservators of Forests (CF), who are
responsible for all forestry development activities within their respective
territorial jurisdiction and of which there are now seven (para 2.17).
However, implementation of the proposed project would require additional
management and supervison and would also involve plantations in additional
areas (which were not part of past forestry programs), for which three addi-
tional circles would therefore be established.
5.03      While at the Circle level there would be no staff specifically
designated for social forestry programs, at the divisional level, a separate
echelon of professional and field staff, with scile responsibilities for



-31-
social forestry programs, would be provided. This would be required in view
of the fact that the general orientation and duties of field staff respon-
sible for implementing social forestry program would be substantially dif-
ferent from those working in production forestry. Thus, at the field levels,
DCFs (SFW), responsible to the Additional CCF (SFW) through the Circle CF,
would have direct responsibility for implementation of the respective area's
programs. DCFs would be assisted by ACFs (2-3 per division), Range Forest
Officers (1 per Taluka), Foresters (4 per Taluka), Forestry Extension Workers
(1 per 12 Panchayats) and part-time Tiotivators (1 per 5 villages) (para
3.31). The above structure for the Social Forestry Wing was agreed with
GOK/KSFD during appraisal. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a) senior and mid-level professional staff including CF, DCF and ACF, and at
least 20 percent of field staff (Foresters, Forest Extension Workers and
Mlotivators) would be appointed by April 30, 1984; (b) further appointments to
SFW would be on the basis of the requirements as per annual implementation
schedule and (c) the proposed monitoring and evaluation cell (para 5.09)
would be established and staffed by September 30, 1984.
Forestry Extension
5.04      As elsewhere in India, the KSFD has had minimal experience in
forestry extension, and its staff operate under job definitions and in an
environnent that is predominantly regulatory. Consequently, most Forest
Department staff lack the training and understanding of changed forestry
objectives that are essential for effective development of a rapidly expand-
ing social forestry sub-sector. The needs of forestry extension are dif-
ferent from those of agricultural crops and the simple technical information
necessary for the successful establishment and maintenance of plantations can
be conveyed easily and quickly to potential growers. WJhile there is a need
for providing advisory services to tree planters, a separate extension serv-
ice within KSFD, comparable to that existing in the Agricultural and Live-
stock Departments, would neither be cost effective nor operationally jus-
tified. In building up advisory services for tree planters, KSFD would,
therefore, emphasize the development of a core of well motivated and trained
field staff (DCF and below) within the KSFD for providing technical expertise
and guidance to and general supervision of social forestry programs. This
capability would be supplemented by the grass root level extension resources
available with the Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development and other
relevant GOK departments, as well as with semi-government and non-government
agencies (details below).
5.05      Developing Extension Capabilities within KSFD:  During appraisal,
job descriptions of social forestry extension staff, including DCF,ACF, RFO,
Foresters and Forest Extension Workers (replacing Forest Guards) were
developed. Those for RFOs, Foresters, FEWs, tIotivators and VEWs are in Annex
13. These would be further reviewed by KSFD and, in consultation with
farmers, Panchayats and relevant government departments, finalized. The job
descriptions of territorial staff, particularly the Circle CF, would also be



-32-
suitably amended to reflect the range of support they would be required to
provide for social forestry programs. An intensive training and orientation
program (induction, in service and on-the-job), particularly for the RFOs,
Foresters, Forest Extension Workers and Motivators, would be organized,
details of which, were discussed with GOK/GOI during appraisal (para 3.34).
5.06      Linkages with Other Relevant Agencies.  Karnataka is implementing
a statewide Training and Visit System of agricultural extension under which
5200 Village Extension Workers (VEW), 750 Agricultural Extension Officers
(AEO) and 170 Assistant Directors will be appointed. It was agreed during
appraisal that VElls would be used, wherever they had been appointed to convey
forestry messages to villagers. Simple, timely messages concentrating on a
few critical impact points (such as choice of species, planting density and
spacing, land preparation methods, depth of planting hole, watering regimes,
fertilization and protection, etc) would be delivered. RFOs and/or other
senior district level forest officers would participate in the monthly
workshops and fortnightly training of the VEWs and AEOs. Similarly, the
services of the Livestock Department's field staff would be utilized to
disseminate messages related to the development and use of fodder plants and
herbaceous and leguminous fodder grasses. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that GOK would, by June 30, 1984, make suitable arrangements for
utilizing the services of the field staff of all relevant Departments of the
State for social forestry extension and the orientation and training of such
field staff would be initiated in time for their services to be available for
the 1984 planting season.
Publicity and Mlass Communication
5.07      A Publicity Cell, headed by an officer of DCF rank would be estab-
lished within the office of the CCF who would be responsible for the plan-
ning, production and dissemination of social forestry-related publicity
materials including, inter alia, printed materials and audio-visual programs
for use of extension staff training and for public relations purposes. Addi-
tionally, Divisional Publicity Cells, within the offices of DCFs and under
the supervision of an ACF would be set up for dissemination of material
received from headquarters as well as for undertaking public rela-
tions/publicity activities specific to the needs of particular areas. At the
divisional level, mobile vans equipped with audio-visual aids would be
provided. The Publicity Cells, both at headquarters and at the Divisions
would be established as a matter of priority.
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.08      A Monitoring and Evaluation Cell (1EC) would be established in the
office of the CCF and which would be responsible for programming, designing,
coordinating and implementing the overall program for;



-33-
(a) collection of data for improving knowledge about the socio-economic
and technical aspects of social forestry prograns;
(b)  providing SFW with information about physical progress of project
plantations, and implementation constraints; and
(c) ongoing and ex-poste evaluation of the impact of the project.
In support of the above objectives, MEC would organize collection of time
series and cross section data based on systematic and well-designed sample
surveys and also conduct short-term studies on special topics related to
social forestry projects. MEC's in-house capabilities in these regards would
be supplemented by retaining consultants (individual or institutional),
particularly for the special studies.
5.09      The proposed MEC would be headed by a qualified forester of DCF
rank with practical experience in forestry programs and with a post-graduate
training in economics/agricultural economics and statistical mmthods. MEC
would also require an economist/agricultural (forestry) economist, an ACF and
statistical and support staff. At the circle, division and range levels,
there would be no special staff for field investigation and enumeration;
instead the RFO's, Foresters and Forestry Extension Workers would be given
training in data collection and interviewing techniques and would be made
responsible for implementing the routine survey activities.
5.10      Currently FAO and the Bank are jointly preparing a manual for the
monitoring and evaluation of social forestry projects in India which, when
finalized, would form the basis of the work program. A mid-term review would
be undertaken by MEC by March 31, 1986 after the third year's planting season
(para 3.05).
Programming, Budgeting, Financial Control and Reporting Requirements
5.11      The Additional CCF (SFW) would have the overall responsibility,
for the preparation of annual work programs and contingent financial
estimates, maintenance of accounts and processing of IDA and ODA disbursement
claims. He would also be responsible, with assistance from MEC, for the
preparation of bi-annual progress reports (financial as well as physical).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that bi-annual progress reports
would be submitted to IDA and ODA no and that no later than six months after
project completion, GOK would prepare and submit to IDA and ODA a project
completion report.
Project Coordination
5.12      Three Committees, two of which would be set up under the project,
would provide policy and advisory support to KSFD in the implementation of
the proposed project. First, at the State level, a Social Forestry Advisory



-34-
Committee (SFAC) would be foried and headed by the Secretary, Department of
Food and Forests, and comprising the two CCFs (Development and General), the
Additional CCF (SFW), the Directors of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry,
Director of Agricultural Extension Department of the SAU, one representative
(not below the rank of a Joint Secretary) each from the Public Works, Rural
Development, Panchayats, Finance and the Revenue Departments. The Additional
CCF (SFW) would be the member-secretary. Its overall function would be to
provide policy gu:idelines for social forestry activities in the State, ensure
appropriate inter-ministerial collaboration in such activities and to review
progress of social forestry development. At the territorial level, Social
Forestry Project Working Committees (SFPWC) would be established with Conser-
vators of Forests as chairmen, and other relevant officers of the Agricul-
ture, Livestock, Panchayat and Public Works Departments as members. Finally,
coordination, policy guidance and implementation assistance at the local
level would be provided by the existing Taluka Level Forestry Committees on
Social Forestry (para 2.11). The composition and overall functions of the
SFAC and the SFPWCs were discussed and agreed with GOI/GOK during nego-
tiations. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that (a) the SFAC and
SFPWCs would be established by September 30, 1984 and (b) by Mlarch 31, 1984,
GOK would review the functions and compositions of the TLFCs to ensure their
effective contribution to project implementation.
Special Provision for the Landless Small Farmers and Disadvantaged Communities
5.13      About thirty percent of KSFD plantations on tank foreshores, C&D
lands and non-gomal wasteland would be designated to individuals (or groups
of individuals) from the poorer sections of nearby communities. 1/ The
allottees would be responsible for protection and maintenance of their
respective areas and would be given the produce generated thereof free of
cost (see also para 5.14). The allottees would also be paid wages for their
work in the establishment, maintenance and protection of their respective
tree plots. The list of such allottees (beneficiaries) would be prepared by
TLFC on the principles now followed in determining beneficiarims of IRDP
programs. In order to facilitate such participation by the poorer section,
KSFD plantations would be located, as far as practicable, in close proximity
to villages or tribal settlements. Agreements on the above principles were
reached during appraisal and assurances confirming these agreements were
obtained during negotiations.
1/ Right of usufruct only and not a transfer of title.



-35-
Distribution of Produce from KSFD Plantations
5.14      Distribution of forestry produce from project plantations on public
lands would be done in a manner that would: (a) help meet the needs of the
local population, particularly the rural poor; (b) encourage community-
/Panchayat participation in social forestry plantings on public lands; (c)
promote further forestry plantations by the Panchayats; (d) provide addi-
tional resources to Panchayats for undertaking general development work; and
(e) help KSFD recover all or part of the investment costs of such planta-
tions. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOK, by December
31, 1984, would finalize arrangements for the distribution of forestry
produce from public plantations in accordance with principles agreed with the
Association. The following are recommended as a guideline for determining
the relative shares of the various participants in the public plantations:
(a) Production from Gomal Lands. Fifty percent of the total
production of firewood, small timber, poles and fruit
would be given to the respective Panchayats and the remaining
fifty percent would be retained by KSFD. The Panchayats
would distribute one-third of its share to the poorer sections
of the villages (as defined under the IRDP program) free of
cost for use as firewood, and/or small timber/poles for
dwelling construction; the other two-thirds would be sold in the
market and the proceeds would be retained by the Panchayats for
general development activities, including social forestry
plantations. 1/ KSFD would sell its share of the produce, either
on site or at other nearby centers. Up to fifteen percent
of the proceeds, net of all direct costs of plantation
establishment and maintenance, would be given to the respective
Panchayats for developing additional forestry plantations for
firewood, fodder and small timber.
(b) Production from non-gomal cultivable wastes, C&D class lands
and tank foreshores: Except as under para 5.13, thirty
percent of the produce would be given to small and marginal
farmers, landless laborers and other poorer sections of the
community free of cost. The remainder would be sold by
KSFD, preferably for the use of neighboring communities;
1/ Under the IRDP programmes, criteria have been set up for defining small
and marginal farmers and members of the scheduled castes and tribes.
These are used for selecting special beneficiary groups in agricultural
development projects and administration of subsidy programs and have been
found to be satisfactory.



-36-
(c)  Production from roadsides and canal banks:  Where the local
comnunities/Panchayats agree to provide maintenance and
protection, twenty percent of the produce would be given to
them free of cost. Otherwise, all produce would accrue to
KSFD for sale;
(d)  Output from bamboo plantations:  All bamboo produced from
KSFD plantations would be given free to the respective tribal
populations. KSFD would make appropriate arrangements with
the respective Tribal Cooperatives and/or organizations involved
in tribal matters (see para 3.14); and
(e)  General provisions:  'Lol) and top' and fruit from all KSFD
plantations would be made available to the poorer sections
of the communities.  Fodder would be made freely available
to everyone.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES
6.01      Incremental Project Production,  Forestry produce from the block
and strip plantations under the proposed project would include fuelwood,
small timber, bamboo, poles, leaf fodder, grass and fruit. Per ha yields
under the various models are based on estimated Mean Annual Increment (MAI)
of individual species in pure stands, reduced pro rata by the number of stems
expected to survive (80% estimated throughout) and adjusted by a conversion
factor of 1.42 m3 over bark per ton. The estimated M4AIs, for all the major
species, expressed in tons/ha/year, are given below.

6.03      lIarketing of project output.  There would be no marketing con-
straint to the incremental production of fuelwood, poles, small timber and
livestock fodder because of the rapidly increasing shortage of these com-
modities and the existence of a functioning marketing infrastructure. Except
for larger farmers and for special occasions, such as festivals, weddings,
etc., firewood is not generally purchased in rural areas. The bulk of
biomass from the fuelwood species, along with the 'lop and top', and leaf and
bark from other species, would be consumed by the tree growing households,
substituting part of the supplies of otherwise collected firewood from the
reserve forests. The remainder would be sold in rural markets to itinerant
merchants from urban and semi-urban areas. Of the fuelwood, poles and small
timber produced on KSFD plantations, approximately one third would be made
available for meeting the needs of the poorer sections of the rural popula-
tion (para 5.14) and the balance would be auctioned or sold through KSFD's



-38-
firewood depots, for consumption in the urban and semi-urban areas. Poles,
small timber (for construction and agricultural implements) and bamboo which
were brought in from other States due to short supply in Karnataka, would
have a ready market in the State. Eucalyptus trees, apart from providing
fuelwood and poles, are also in high demand from a paper mill and two rayon
mills in the State for use as pulpwood.
6.04      While current shortages are obvious, no reliable information exists
on the long term demand and supply situation.  Such information, however, is
of utmost importance particularly when substantial private and public plant-
ings are now underway in response to the prevailing high prices of forestry
produce. The proposed Wood Balance Study (para 3.37) would be devoted to
analyzing the factors most likely to influence future demand for and supply
of forestry products and to estimating their net availabilities during the
late 1990's. A suggested outline of the study, which was agreed with
GOK/GOI, is in Annex 7.
6.05      Prices:  Except for subsidized prices applicable to the small
quantities of fuelwood sold through government fuelwood depots, there are
no other market interventions by the public sector and most fuelwood, poles,
construction timber, etc. are sold at prices determined in the free market.
KSFD subsidized prices are established on a no loss/no profit basis and take
into account the direct costs of harvesting and transportation to the depots.
KSFD prices are substantially lower than market prices. The following table
summarizes the subsidized, free market and estimated economic prices for the
different forestry products.

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
Project Benefits
7.01      Project Beneficiaries.  The direct beneficiaries of the proposed
project would primarily be the rural and semi-urban population in Karnataka
who depend heavily on forest produce such as fuelwood, small timber, poles
and fodder for their everyday living. The rural poor, including the landless
laborers, small and marginal farmers, members of tribal groups and of other
disadvantaged communities, would be particularly benefitted by the additional
employment that would be generated by the project (para 7.03) and by part of
the output from plantations on public land that would be given to them free
of charge (paras 5.13 and 5.14). The existing pulpwood industry is also
likely to benefit from the incremental production of softwood.
7.02    Production Impact.  Average annual incremental production of
biomass 1/ would include 0.36 million tons of fuelwood, 0.97 million tons of
Eucalyptus wood, 0.02 million tons of small timber and sone 0.01 million tons
of bamboo. The incremental quantity is over 45% of current production level
1/ From 8th year of plantation for fuelwood species and Eucalyptus, and from
15th year for bamboo and timber.



-40-
of these goods, and hence would help reduce the gradually increasing shortage
of fuelwood, timber and poles. Incremental production of fuelwood would help
meet the needs of some 300-400,000 people in the state. The incremental
production of fodder, estimated at about 16,000 tons of dry matter annually,
would be sufficient to provide additional dry matter required to make some
30-40,000 cattle productive.
7.03    Employment Generation.  Over the five year project period, 70 million
mandays (12 million on public and 58 million on private plantations) of labor
would be generated by the project. Additionally, some 118 million mandays
are expected to be created during the post-investment years on account of
harvesting, protection, maintenance and fodder collection activities. Ilost
of the additional employment would benefit the poorer sections of the popula-
tion.
7.04    Environmental Benefits.  Major environmental benefits from project
plantations would include soil cDnservation, improvement in soil fertility
and micro-climatic improvements (e.g. reduction in evaporation loses, etc.).
Hlost of the plantations would ha-ve a mixture of species, some of which would
be leguminous. This would prevent the instability that is associated with
monocultures and also would contribute to soil fertility.  Block plantations
on gomal and C&D lands, and strip plantations on roadsides and canal banks,
would help prevent soil erosion. Plantations on foreshores of tanks and
resevoirs would prevent silt deposits and thereby improve the productive life
of tanks. Finally, increased availability of forest produce generated by the
project would relieve pressures on the "traditional" forests and thereby help
reduce their depletion.
7.05    Institutional Development.  A long-term benefit of the project would
be the development of organizational and operational capabilities within KSFD
for providing effective social forestry extension services.
Financial and Economic Analysis
7.06    Based on the assumptions and estimates summarized in para 7.07 below
the financial and economic rates of return for the proposed project are
estimated to be 20% and 22%, respectively.  The net present value (NPV) of
the project is Rs 691 million andl that of the KSFD plantation and farm
forestry components, Rs 6 million and Rs 581 million respectively. The NPV
of the bamboo plantations, plantations on tank foreshores and roadside plan-
tations in dry zones are negative. However, t:hese represent only about 5% of
total project plantations and less than 3% of project costs. Moreover,
bamboo plantations would benefit exclusively tribal people, while the planta-
tions on tank foreshores and roadsides would help prevent soil erosion.



-41-
7.07    Assumptions for Economic and Financial Analysis.
(a)  Project Life.  36 years based on the rotations of the species
planted.
(b)  Standard Conversion Factor.  All costs and benefits were
adjusted by an SCF of 0.8, as currently estimated by the
Bank, to derive economic values.
(c)  Opportunity Cost of Capital.  All costs and benefits were
discounted by 12% which is the currently estimated OCC.
(d)  Project Costs.  All direct costs of nursery works and planta-
tion establishment, staff, vehicle, equipment, civil works
and operation and maintenance costs were included. Value of
some agricultural crops foregone as a result of tree planta-
tions was included as project cost. For economic analysis,
all costs were adjusted by the SCF's.
(e)  Project Benefits.  Only incremental forestry production
resulting from the project, including fuelwood, timber, poles,
bamboo, fruit and fodder, were included in the benefit stream.
Indirect project benefits such as increased crop production
due to improved soil fertility brought about by greater
availability of cow dung manure, reduced soil erosion and
silting of irrigation reservoirs and canals, etc., were not
included in the analysis because of the methodological problems
in quantifying such benefits. For similar reasons benefits
from improvements in ecology and the environment, time savings
in gathering fuelwood and reduced pressure on reserved forest
areas were not included in the analysis.
(f)  Prices.  All costs and benefits were valued in mid 1983
constant prices for financial analysis. Produce from KSFD
plantations was valued at GOK subsidized prices and others
at average market prices. Labor was valued at Rupees 7 per
day and 70% of it was taken as the economic wage rate which
is roughly equivalent to the weighted average of peak and
off season market wage rates.
Cost Recovery
7.08    The proposed project is intended to meet some of the critical
basic needs of the rural and semi-urban people, particularly the poor
(paras 7.01 - 7.03). Such public sector investments are generally viewed as
part of the government's normal program for the socio-economic uplift and
welfare of the rural population, and costs for which are traditionally not



-42-
recovered from the beneficiaries. Since there are no direct taxes or cesses
on farmers' produce, directly generated revenue from the farm forestry
plantations (which accounts for nearly 65% of all direct plantation costs
and 80% of forestry produce) wouLd also not increase.  However, costs would
be recovered wherever possible. For example, some 50% of the production
from public plantations would be sold by the (KSFD and the proceeds would help
recover a substantial part of its investments on such plantations.
Furthermore, costs of seedlings In excess of '750 per family would be
fully recovered (currently unlim"ted quantities are given free). Thus,
the project would substantially reduce the incremental fiscal impact of the
farm forestry component. The indirect benefits arising from improved
environmental conditions, improvement in soil fertility and microclimatic
conditions, reduced pressure on forest reserves, employment of rural poor, etc.
could very well represent a stream of future benefits that would
exceed the present values of all project related outlays and thus
constitute a substantial indirect: recovery of project costs.
Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
7.09   lWhile the proposed projec.t would be implemented by a well established
operational department of GOK, its capabilities in social forestry, both in
terms of staff resources and field experience, are somewhat limited.
Although the project would provide adequate incremental staff and training,
delays in recruitment, which have constrained other IDA-financed social
forestry projects, could impair implementation, particularly of the farm
forestry component. In order to minimize such organizational and management
problems, early recruitment of senior professional staff, as well as some
essential field staff, would be ensured (para 5.03), staff training would be
accelerated (paras 3.34 and 5.05) and wherever possible field staff of other
relevant agencies would be utilized (paras 5.04 and 5.06).
7.10    Sufficient public lands would be available for KSFD plantations and
farmers are known to be responsive to planting trees on marginally productive
land. Hence availability of land would not constrain achievement of planting
targets. Limiting free distribution of seedlings to a maximum of 650 seed-
lings per family (para 3.19) would not have any adverse effect on planting by
private farmers because financial rates of return to all categories of farm
forestry are high. However, this issue would be kept under constant review
by GOK and IDA supervision missions and particularly at the time of mid-term
review (para 3.05).
7.11    Technical risks are minimal because the species to be planted,
including the exotic ones, are well known in the state and are well adapted
to the local agro-climatic and environmental conditions. Given the pos-
sibility of high mortality rates of seedlings and the problens of protection
from grazing, there are some risks that projected yield levels rlight not be
attained. This has been taken into account in estimating project incremental
benefits and estimated yields are well below known potential.



-43-
7.12    A sensitivity analysis was done to test the impact of variations in
projected benefit and cost streams on the project's economic and financial
rates of return. It shows that (a) benefits have to go down by 60% or costs
to increase by 149% in order to make the project economically unattractive
(i.e. NPV would be equal to zero); (b) risk levels of KSFD plantations, with
switching values of -3.29% for benefits and +3.4% for costs, are quite high,
and (c) the IRR is insensitive to implementation delays (a two year lag would
reduce the IRR to 18%. Details of the analysis are in Annex 10.
7.13    Monitoring and on-going evaluation of the progress of the project,
would be continuous, and the proposed mid-term review would enable the
project's goals and targets to be appropriately adjusted to ensure
financial/economic viability of the project.
VIII. RECOIMENDATIONS
8.01    The following major assurances were obtained during negotiations:
(a)  a joint GOK/GOI/IDA review of project implementation would be held
after completion of the third year's tree planting, but no later
than March 31, 1986; Karnataka would ensure that up to the mid-term
review plantation would not exceed 8,000 ha of gomal and 5,000 ha
of C & D land out of the 20,000 ha of agriculturally unproductive
wasteland to be planted under the project (para 3.05);
(b)  beginning with the 1984-85 planting programme, up to 1,500 seed-
lings (including replacement for losses) per family and up to 750
seedlings from 1985-86 would be given free of charge and seedlings
above this limit would be charged at actual KSFD costs of produc-
tion (para 3.19);
(c)  GOK would, by June 30, 1984, review its current social forestry
research program, and, based on that, prepare a detailed research
program for implementation during the project and which would be
submitted to IDA for concurrence (para 3.36);
(d)  KSFD would (i) make available to IDA and ODA review missions for
their inspection all documents to support project expenditures
(para 4.12); (ii) maintain separate accounts for all project expen-
ditures categorized by each component (para 4.14); (iii) have such
accounts and statements of expenditures audited annually by govern-
ment or private auditing firm satisfactory to IDA (para 4.14); and
(iv) submit to IDA and ODA within nine months after the end of each
fiscal year such final audited accounts and statements of expendi-
tures (para 4.14));



-44-
(e) senior and mid-level forestry staff and at least 20% of field staff
for the SFW would be appoined by April 30, 1984 (para 5.03); the
MTEC would be established and staffed by September 30, 1984 (para
5.03);
(f)  by September 30, 1984, the SFAC and the SFPWCs would be estab-
lished; the functions of the TLFCs would be reviewed by Mlarch 31,
1984 (para 5.12);
(g) Karnataka would, by December 31, 1984, finalize arrangements for
the distribution of forestry produce from gomal lands and other
public plantations in accordance with principles agreed with the
Association.
8.02    With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would
be suitable for an IDA credit of US$27.0 million to GOI on standard IDA
terms.

KARNATAKA SOCIAL FORESTRY PROJECT
WOOD-BALANCE STUDY
1.      No reliable information exists on the availability and consumption of
wood and related products in the regions and rural areas of the States of
Karnataka. Such knowledge is, however, extremely important for planting
forestry development. A wood-balance study is, therefore, proposed as a part
of the project.
2.      The purpose of the study, which would be undertaken during the
implementation of the project, will be to estimate current and future con-
sumption for the next two decades and the supply of wood, forest based
products and related commodities in the State during the same period. The
consumption study would cover rural as well as urban areas, which would be
based on agro-climatic zones.
3.      The terms of reference of this study would be as follows:
(a)  Income elasticity of consumption of forest based products would be
estimated by household sampling;
(b)  Consumption forecasts of forest based products for the next two
decades would be made on the basis of the income elasticities so
computed and keeping demographic and income changes in view;
(c)  Consumption of forest based products for industrial purposes shall be
estimated separately keeping in the view industrial growth trends;
and
(d)  Supply side estimates will be made based on current net availability
of the concerned commodities. Based on existing natural and manmade
forest yield potential (and agricultural crop production/number of
cattle, etc.) and planned development availabilities, the future net
availability will be estimated separately for the State.
4.      Specifically, the study shall estimate the current and future con-
sumption and supply of fuelwood, charcoal, cattle-dung cake (for fuel),
agricultural wastes (for fuel) and other energy forms used for cooking and
heating including oil.  Similar estimates shall be made for wooden poles,
bamboos, small timber for implements, carts, fencing, rural construction and
other miscellaneous purposes including agricultural uses. Forest products
requirements for local wood based industries, pulp and paper including hand-
icrafts, etc. shall also be estimated.
