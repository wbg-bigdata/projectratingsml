MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE
PAITON THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Indonesia for US$354.0 million is submitted for approval.
The proposed loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance the
Paiton Thermal Power Project. The proceeds of the loan, except US$1.0
million for technical assistance to GOI, would be onlent to the State
Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years, including a grace period of
five years, &nd the onlending rate would be equal to the Bank's standard
variable interest rate plus fees of 1.90Z. The foreign exchange risk will
be borne by the Government. The Government is arranging confinancing from
bilateral sources for US$92.0 million equivalent, while export credits at
market rates would provide another US$274.0 million equivalent.
Background
2.       Indonesia is richly endowed with energy resources including oil,
natural gas, coal, hydropower and geothermal energy. Since the country
depends on oil for a major part of its exports, a major objective of the
Government's energy policy has been to maintain the level of oil export
earnings by diversification of domestic energy consumption away from
petroleum products towards alternative fuels for which there is a
nonexportable surplus (coal and natural gas) or which are nontradeable
(hydropower and geothermal). The power subsector is playing a central role
in this respect.
3.       Indonesia's electric power subsector comprises:  (a) PLN, the
State Electricity Corporation; (b) captive plants installed by private
parties, mainly industries, for their own use; and (c) a small number of
rural cooperatives set up to provide electricity in certain rural areas.
The objectives of the power subsector are .o improve the welfare of the
population and support the growth of economi_ activity by meeting the
electricity requirements of the economy in an efficient and reliable
manner. In pursuit of these objectives, PLN's supply facilities have grown
rapidly during the past decade. its installed capacity increased by 2822 to
6,420 MM; its sales grew by 3842 to 17,077 GWh; the number of consumers
grew by 4852 to 8.2 million. Despite this rapid growth, the per capita
electricity consumption in Indonesia in 1987/88 is only about 200 kWh, and
only 24Z of al: households are electrified. This level is much lower than
that in the neighboring countries. The low level of electricity consumption
in Indonesia is primarily due to the lack of supply facilities and access
to the network for the residential and other sectors. Given this
situation, PLN's current targets for 1993/94 (end of the Fifth Five-Year
Plan) are to increase installed capacity to over 11,000 KW. This would
allow it to reach 352 of th population, as well as to supply about three
quarters of industrial ele ricity consumption.



2-
Sector Stratesy
4.       The Bank has supported the rapid expansion of Indonesia's power
sector through the financing of 15 projects since 1969. These projects
have assisted PLN to expand in a least cost manner and diversify its
sources of fuels by introducing coal and geothermal plants, developing
hydroelectric potential, creating an integrated 500 kV grid on Java,
extending distribution facilities, reducing transmission and distribution
losses, and enhancing its institutional capacities, particularly its
capability to carry out a rapid expansion program. More recently, the
Bank's support has focussed on developing PLN into a modern and efficient
utility bys  (a) strengthening technical and corporate planning; (b)
improving organization and management, (c) improving operating efficiency;
and (d) developing human resources.
5.       At present, PLN is headed in the right direction in a number of
important ways: (a) in reducing its reliance on petroleum fuels in favor of
more economical fuels such as coal and natural gas, (b) in shifting its
focus beyond project implementation towards broader issues of system
efficiency and quality of service, (c) in moving towards reduced dependence
on Government funds and greater reliance on internal sources, and (d) in
transforming itself from a government agency into a modern, commercially
oriented enterprise. The Bank is closely involved in supporting the
successful achievement of these objectives.
6.       Under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project
(Loan 2778-IND) approved in January 1987, it was agreed that PLN's
operations in Java would achieve a rate of return of 82 in FY 1988/89.
Since the Government did not permit tariff adjustments in 1988, this target
was not achieved. However, on March 27, 1989 an average increase of 25Z in
the electricity tariff was announced by the Government, meeting the
condition of the negotiations of the proposed loan. As a result, PLN will
achieve the agreed rate of return in FY 1989/90. The tariff level achieved
after this adjustment is slightly above the average long run marginal cost
of supply and is sufficient to place PLN on a sound financial footing.
PLN's operations outside Java are expected to reach a financial break-even
in FY 1992/93 compared to the earlier target of FY 1990/91, as a result of
measures, including efficiency improvements, that are in progress.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
7.       The proposed project would further the strategic objectives for
the sector. The Bank has been closely involved in the preparation of the
Paiton project, including the feaslbility study, site selection, design,
and engineering phases. Detailed environmental impact assessment has been
carried out and the required mitigating measures have been incorporated in
the design. Project implementation would benefit from the Bank's continued
association through technical advice and financial support. The proposed
project would act as a vehicle for further strengthening PLN's financial
autonomy, development of skilled manpower for complex engineering tasks,
and strengthening GOI's institutional capacity to formulate, monitor and
enforce environmental protection measures in the energy sector. The
project also wo-ld help foster an efficient coal. industry in Indonesia
through agreed actions, which include: (a) providing a choice to PLN, on
the basis of price, to contract for the supply of coal from amongst several



private companies; (b) establishing infrastructure for coal transrortation
from Kalimantan to Paiton, Jncluding loading and shipping facilities; and
(c) ensuring that the price of indigenous coal to PLN will be no higher
than the world market price.
Project Obiectives
8.       The objectives of the proposed project are to:  (a) expand PLN's
generating capacity in Java to meet the expected demand growth during
1992/93-1994195; (b) promote the use of coal for economic electricity
generation; (c) develop PLN's project implementation capability by fully
involving its newly-established Engineering Services Center in the
engineering, design and project management aspects; (d) strengthen the
Government's environmental monitoring capability as well as its ability to
formulate and enforce environmental standards in t'&- energy sector; and (e)
develop an efficient domestic coal industry.
Project Description
9.       The project includes:  (a) the construction of the Paiton power
plant comprising two coal-fired generating units of 400 MW each and other
support elements necessary to complete the installation, together with an
infrastructure to accommodate future units for an ultimate plant capacity
of 4,000 MW; (b) construction of a 500 kV transmission line between Paiton
and Krian (about 140 km) with associated substations; (c) construction of a
150 kV transmission line between Probolinggo, Paiton and Situbondo (about
100 km) with associated substations; and (d) technical assistance to (i)
strengthen the capability of the Ministry of Mines and Energy to formulate,
monitor and enforce environmental standards in the energy sector; and (ii)
develop PLN's engineering and design staff by helping them attend higher
educational courses and receive advanced training in power plant
technology. The first unit is planned to be in commercial operation by
September 1993, followed by the second unit in March 1994. The Bank loan
will finance equipmet and materials, marine works, consulting services and
technical assistance. The total financing requirement for the project is
US$1,117.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
US$792.0 million (70.92). A breakdown of rosts and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7718-IND dated May
25, 1989. is heinR distributed sep4rately.
Actions Agreed
10.      Agreements were reached on the following actions:  (a) the
Government will furnish to the Bank, by December 31, 1989, an action plan
for the supply of coal to Paiton and will implement it, thereafter, to
reach a supply capability of about 2.5 million tons/year beginning March
31, 1994; (b) the Government will ensure that the price of indigenous coal
delivered to Paiton is no higher than the equivalent world market price;
(c) all contracts will be awarded in accordance with a time schedule
satisfactory to the Bank; and (d) consultants will be appointed in
accordance with a time schedule satisfactory to the Bank. Bank guidelines
for procurement and appointment of consultants will apply. In addition,
the following agreements, which are the same in substance as those under
fhoa Pncr Transmission and Distribution Project (Loan 2778-IND) and the



- 4 -
propoised Power Sector Efficiency Project, are also included in this
project: (a) establishment of an energy pricing task force and an energy
pricing unit; (b) coordination of private generation with PLN's generation;
(c) realization of an annual rate of re'turn of not less than 8% on PLN's
revalued average net fixed assets in operation in Java in FY 1989190 and
thereafter; (d) achievement of a financial break-even situation for PLN'e
non-Java operations in FY 1992/93 (e) segregation of financial and
operating information on PLN's rural electrification activities; (f) annual
review of PLN's development plans and investment programs; (g)
implementation of an action plan for efficiency improveme- ; (h)
maintenance of he overdue accounts of Government users w_ ,in two months'
billing; (i) review of financing plans for PLN's investment program; (j)
annual review of tariff level and structure; and (k) limitation of debt and
audit of accounts.
Benefits
11.      The IERR on PLN's investment program in Java for 1989190-1994/95,
vhich includes the proposed project, would be 22Z. The IERR, with only
revenue at prevailing tariff as the benefit, and ignoring consumer surplus,
is 132. The financial rate of return on the Paiton Thermal Power Project,
including the associated transmission and distribution system, is 10X,
indicating the adequacy of the prevailing tariffs.
RiEks
12.      The Paiton project is similar to the coal-fired Suralaya project
financed under the Eighth and the Ninth Power Projects; the experience
gained at Suralaya confirms that there are no technical risks associated
with the Paiton project. There is a risk of delay in the project for two
reasons: first, PLN will need to award the contracts on schedule; and
second, there could be inefficiency in implementation. To reduce the first
risk, an understanding with PLN and GOI was reached on a suitable time
schedule for the award of contracts. Regarding the second, PLN has gained
considerable experience in the management of such projects in the past few
years and has developed competent personnel for project management, who
will work with the consultants, already in place, to manage the
construction of the Paiton Thermal Power Project.
Recommendation
13.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
