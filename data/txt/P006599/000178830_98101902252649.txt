REPORT AND RECONNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED IAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A COPPER SECTOR PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan tc the Republic of Chile for the equivalent of US$33 million to
help finance a copper sector project. The loan wouiLd have a term of 15
years, including 3 1/2 years of grace, with interest at 8 1/2 percent
per annum.  The equivalent of US$29.54 million and US$3.46 million of the
proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Corpora-i6n del Cobre
(CODEUJO) and to the Empresa Nacional de Mineria (ESIAMI), respectively
for 15 years, including 3 1/2 years of grace, with interest at 1C percent
per annum.
PART I - THE EOONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Chile in Octocer/November 1975 and
its findings are contained in Report No. 966-CH entitled an "Economic
Memorandum on Chile" issued on December 24, 1975. Annex I contains
country data sheets.
3.        The Chilean economy in recent years has been disrupted by major
shifts in the political situation and in government economic philosophy and
policies, which greatly exacerbated such traditional weaknesses as heavy
dependence on mining exports, persistent inflation, inefficient budget and
tax administration, a low savings propensity on the part of private house-
holds, and high levels of industrial protection to -the detriment of agricul-
tural growth and export diversification.   The growth of output, which had
slowed perceptibly through the second half of the 1960s, picked up sharply
in 1971 in response to expansionary government policies; but then stagnated
in 1972 and fell in 1973 as declining investment, suzpply bottlenecks, and
general uncertainties exhausted the economy's ability to respond to the
continuing demand stimulus. Consumer pritces, propelled by massive govern-
ment deficits and monetary expansion, rose some 35 to 40 times between 1969
and the end of 1973, reversing by 1972 the real wage gains achieved in 1970
and 1971.  Selective price controls seriously distorted the structure of
prices and resulted in supply shortages throughout the economy. The decline
in agricultural output was particularly sharp, prodluction in 1973 dropping
below the levels of the nid-1960s. Rising food imports and falling copper
production contributed to an accumulated loss of international reserves
amounting to US$850 million between 1970 and 1973. Chile ceased to make
scheduled payments on most of its debt service obligations in 1971. During
the 1970-1973 period, a large share of the manufactluring sector, the entire
financial sector, the major copper mines,; and appro:imately one-third of
cultivable agricultural land were taken under government control, with en-
suing problems of administration, structural adaptation, loss of investment,
and the flight of technical-managerial expertise.



- 2 -
4.        The Government that took power in September 1973 immediately
announced its intention to reduce drastically the direct role of govern-
ment in the economy and to move as quickly as possible to a mixed economic
system where prices, with few exceptions, would be determined by market
forces.  Among its primary short-run objectives were the stabilization
and rationalization of prices, the recovery of output and real income
levels, the balancing of the international accounts, and the establishment
of the basis for market-oriented, "outward-looking" growith.
5.        Major policy changes affecting the international sector were the
re-introduction of flexible exchange rates, measures to promote the expan-
sion of copper and nontraditional exports, reductions in tariff and non-
tariff barriers to imports and stringent limits on new foreign borrowings.
The escudo was sharply devalued in late 1973, and subsequent adjustments
have generally kept pace with rising domestic prices." Agricultural
imports declined sharply as agricultural output rebounded. Total imports
in 1974 rose 39 percent over 1973, however, mainly because of higher
prices, particularly for petroleum. Despite the larger import bill the
external accounts improved markedly in 1974, as a result of increased
copper output and higher prices, coupled with the doubling of non-copper
exports. The trade deficit was reduced to US$94 million in 1974, as
compared with US$427 million and US$357 million in the two previous years,
respectively.  A rescheduling agreement, covering service payments due in
1973 and 1974, was reached with major creditors, and settlement was a-
chieved of outstanding compensation claims of expropriated foreign investors.
A US$95 million Stand-By Agreement was negotiated with the IMF in January
1974, and an additional US$142 million was acquired under the 1974 Oil-
Facility.
6.        Concentrated efforts were made by the new Government to raise
output, with particular attention to agriculture. Consolidation of the
massive land reform implemented by the previous regime is being accomplished
by the resolution of disputed claims, the accelerated titling of new small
landowners, adequate price incentives, and the provision of credit and
technical assistance. Other major domestic policy changes introduced in
late 1973 and 1974 wJere the freeing of most domestic prices and the divest-
ment of most expropriated assets. In addition new taxes and increased tax
rates were introduced, which--in combination with improved tax administra-
tion, higher tariff schedules and improved efficiency in the public enter-
prises--have greatly improved the financial performance of the fiscal sector.
The central government achieved a current account budgetary surplus in 1974
for the first time in four years and its overall deficit was reduced to the
equivalent of 6 percent of GDP in 1974, as compared to 9 percent in 1973
and 11 percent in 1972. Expenditures continued to grow in 1974, however, as
. The peso replaced the escudo in October 1975 as Chile's monetary unit.
The peso was made equivalent to 1,000 escudos.



- 3 -
the Government, encouraged by high copper prices in the first half of
the year, attempted to maintain real wages and employment in the face
of rising domestic and international prices. Consequently, the Govern-
ment deficit and the resulting expansion of Central Bank credit remained
a major source of continuing inflation in 1974, consumer prices rising
376 percent.
7.        Inflation began to accelerate in the first quarter of 1975
and the balance of payments deteriorated sharply as a consequence of
the falling world copper price, which dropped to its lowest level in
real terms in more than a decade. As a result, an nmmanageable
balance of payments deficit was in prospect for 1975 unless imports
were sharply cut back and another rescheduling of d3bt service was
negotiated with major creditors. Accordingly, the Government intro-
duced strong new austerity measures in April 1975. Public sector
spending has been dramatically curtailed and the expansion of credit
to the public sector significantly reduced. Because of the measures
taken, it is estimated that the central government budgetary deficit
in 1975 will amount to less than 2 percent of the GDP.
8.        As a consequence of the austerity measures introduced last
April, imports in 1975 have been reduced by about one-fifth as compared
to 1974 and, in real per capita terms, they have been Ctt back to the
level of the mid-1960s. Non-copper exports have continued to grow rapid-
ly, rising 20 percent in real terms in 1975. Most major creditors again
agreed to reschedule debt service due. In March 1975, Chile signed a
new US$95 million Stand-By Agreement with the IMF. Only a US$22 million
first tranche was drawn, however, as the greater-thin-expected shortfall
in copper earnings resulted in rates of credit expaision and reserve
lcss in excess of the stipulated second-quarter taryets. With the aus-
terity measures taking hold, however, the IMF approvTed a US$96 million
credit in November under the 1975 Oil-Facility.  The net effect of the
austerity program, together with debt rescheduling, has been a reduction
in the estimated balance of payments deficit from tle US$800 million
plus forecast in April to less than US$250 million. Viewed another way,
the balance of payments suffered a deterioration of only US$l00-150 mil-
lion despite a US$700 million decline in copper earnings. The results
of the austerity program have also been manifest on the inflation front.
The monthly rate of increase of consumer prices, wh:ich averaged 18 per-
cent through the first six months, had fallen to 8.2 percent by November,
and there is evidence that the very high velocity of money, reflecting in-
flationary expectations, is receding.



- h -
9.        The social and economic costs of this adjustment have been
very high. After a year of growth in 197h, the real gross domestic
product is estimated to have fallen 12 to 15 percent in 1975. Unem-
ployment in Greater Santiago had risen to 16.6 percent of the labor
force by September.  The Government has initiated programs of minimum
employment, wage subsidization, and food distribution but heavy sacri-
fices are being required of the Chilean people. Given the severity
of the nation's external payments constraint, however, and the persis-
tent threat of hyperinflation, the only clear alternative to the
program adopted would have been the restoration of comprehensive
controls on the economy and default on international obligations.   Such
a course would have provided short-run relief at best and the eventual
social and economic costs might well have been greater than those of
of the present program.
10.       Despite the progress made by Chile in developing other export
possibilities, recovery from the current depressed situation depends
largely on the resurgence of world demand for copper. With significant price
movement not likely before the middle of 1976, Chile must look forward to
another very difficult year.   In order to meet the approximately US$790
million in debt service that will fall due in 1976, Chile will need to
continue to exercise extreme import restraint. This probably means little
or no growth of GDP in 1976. The situation would, of course, be ameliorated
somewhat by more rapid recovery in the industrial countries, increased in-
flows of fast disbursing foreign capital, and/or a new debt rescheduling
agreement with major creditors. In consonance with the situation, the
Chilean authorities have indicated they intend to maintain the policy of
austerity into 1976. The public sector budget is to be held at approximate-
ly the same level in real terms as in 1975, and the deficit will be further
reduced.  Within the budget limits, there will be a reallocation of expendi-
tures in favor of housing, education and health.
11.       Beyond 1976, the picture looks considerably brighter.   Copper
prices should have improved significantly by 1977 (to a projected US$.80
per lb. on the LME) with the growth of demand permitting the mines to
return to full production. Along with the recovery of the world copper
market, the continued growth of non-copper exports at around 10 percent
per year and projected capital inflows are expected to enable Chile to
attain a steady growth of output through the rest of the decade. In such
an environment it should be possible to reduce Chile's debt service ratio
from 38 percent of exporLs in 1976 to below 20 percent in 1980, and its
international reserves could be gradually replenished. Continued fiscal and
monetary restraint will, of course, be necessary to assure the required
recovery of domestic savings and to direct a large share of the anticipated
terms-of-trade gains to productive investment. Looking further ahead, the
agricultural sector offers excellent export potential. Forest products, in
particular, are expected to become a major export, second only to copper,
by the late 1980s.   Since the end of 1973, more than US$250 million of
foreign direct investments have been approved, mostly in mining (non-copper)
and manufacturing, and some US$2-3 billion of investment in copper, gas,
oil and petrochemicals are under active discussion and negotiation.



12.       In summary, Chile is in the midst of its mo,t difficult economic
situation since the Depression of the thirties, and little relief can be
foreseen before the end of 1976. The Government, however, has made the
hard austerity decisions required, while at the same `ime tackling many
of the fundamental economic reforms long recommended by the Bank and
other international institutions.   It has gone a long way toward rational-
izing the structure of prices, including interest rates and the exchange
rate, made substantial improvements in the public sec;or budgetary process,
implemented a major tax reform, instituted significan; steps toward the
modernization of the financial system, and has opened the domestic economy
to the opportunities and competition of the international economy. In
light of these efforts as well as of Chile's excellen- physical and human
resource base, and of the prospects for export growth, I consider Chile
creditworthy for additional Bank lending.
13.       Official external development financing to Chile during 1974 and
1975 has been provided principally by the Inter-American Development Bank.
(IDB) and USAID. The IDB has made five loans to Chile during this period,
including US$75 million for hydroelectric power, US$22 million for agri-
cultural rehabilitation, US$10 million for industrial credit, US$35 mil-
lion for telecommunications, and US$25 million for urban infrastructure
and services. AID has made two loans in 1975--US$5 million for nutrition
and US$15 million for agricultural cooperatives. AID guarantees were
authorized for us$55 million of housing investments.   In addition, a
total of more than US$100 million of commodity assistance was provided
under U.S. Public Law 480 in 1974 and 1975.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CHILE
ia.       Among the world's developing countries, Chile is the Bank's
oldest borrower. Our first development loan ever was extended to the
country in 1948 and, since then, the Bank has made 20 loans to
Chile totaling US$265.5 million, net of cancellations. The Association has
also extended one credit of US$19 million to the country for a road project.
IFC commitments in Chile come to US$21.2 million with US$15 million of this
amount committed to copper mining and the remainder tc industry. The
Corporation presently holds US$9.6 million of its Chilean commitments. Bank
Group loans and credits made to, or guaranteed by, the Republic of Chile
constituted about 5.9 percent of Chile's total indebtedness (including undis-
bursed amounts) in 1975 and accounted for about 3.9 percent of the country's
1975 debt service obligations after rescheduling.
15.       Of total Bank and IDA lending to Chile, nearly half (43 percent)
has been for power, 17 percent for roads, 16 percent for agriculture and 4
percent for education. The remaining 20 percent has teen earmarked for
industry, technical assistance and coal mining.



16.       Historically, the volume of Bank lending to Chile has
fluctuated substantially, varying in accordance with the country's
economic performance and the availability of suitable projects.   In
FY1971-73 the Bank did not lend to Chile because of the severe deteri-
oration in economic and financial management described in the preced-
ing section. In FY1974 the Bank increased the amount of two existing
loans to finance up to US$8.3 million of interest and other charges
and also made a US$5.25 million Technical Assistance Loan. Our most
recent Chilean operation was the US$20 million loan for agricultural
rehabilitation approved by the Executive Directors in May 1975.
17.       Execution of Bank-financed projects has, on the whole,
been satisfactory. In the case of the highway and education leans
made in 1970, however, a high rate of inflation coupled with deteri-
orating conditions in the local construction industry and a shortage
of counterpart funds combined to slow down markedly project imple-
mentation. These difficulties are gradually being overcome, however,
and project execution is returning to a satisfactory basis. A
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC commitments to
Chile as at November 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects are contained in Annex II.
18.       In addition to the proposed copper sector loan, the Bank
has also appraised a project to help rehabilitate Chile's power
system and an agricultural credit project which would provide medium-
and long-term credit for livestock, fruits, and vineyards as well as agro-
industry. These projects are designed to strengthen the country's pro-
ductive capacity and balance of payments position, and to improve the
effectiveness of institutions in major sectors of the economy. The
presentation of these projects to the Executive Directors will depend
on the maintenance of sound economic policies which give promise of
strengthening creditworthiness, stimulating growth and improving in-
come distribution.
PART III - THE COPPER SECTOR
Background
19.       Copper mining in Chile has a long history dating back to
the pre-Colombian era. By the early part of the 19th century, the
industry had already developed into the mainspring of the economy
and in ensuing years Chilean copper output grew to the point where
it accounted for L0 percent of world production by the 1860s. Since
then, copper's dominance in the economy has been interrupted only once,



- 7 -
from 1890 to 1920, when booming nitrate exports coui?led with falling copper
production--the result of the exhaustion of most hi'h grade mines--allowed
nitrate to temporarily eclipse copper's importance. The discovery of syn-
thetic substitutes for Chilean nitrate and the development of technology
permitting the economic exploitation of lower grade copper deposits,
however, reestablished copper to its customary position of supremacy.
Between 1920 and 1945, Chile and the United States were the world's larg-
est copper producers with each accounting for about 17 percent of world
output.
20.       Chilean copper expansion since the Second World War has not
been as dynamic as that of other copper producing countries except for
the 1956-60 period. In the early 1960s, concern over Chile's declining
role in the world copper market provided added impetus to local political
demands for increased government participation in the sector which was
then controlled almost entirely by foreign-owned erterprises. This pres-
sure resulted in the Chileanization Program of the Frei aclministration
(1964-70) which called (a) for a doubling of copper output to one million
MT per year by 1970 and to a tripling of refinery capacity; (b) for part
ownership by the Government of the largest copper companies; and (c) for
state control over the marketing of Chilean copper.
21.       In July 1971, during the Allende administration, the Chilean
Congress approved an amendment to the Constitution authorizing the complete
nationalization of Chile's principal mining operations. The amendment
provided, inter alia, for the deduction of "excess" profits from the com-
pensation packages due expropriated foreign firms. This resulted in a
government decision not to compensate the foreign-owned companies for their
nationalized assets. Subsequently, however, the present Chilean Government
agreed to provide compensation to the former owners of the nationalized
copper mining operations. Negotiations were successfully concluded with
them in October 1974.
Structure of the Sector
22.       The five large scale mining companies, which constitute the Gran
Mineria and which are managed by the Corporaci6n dEl Cobre (CODELCO), occupy
a position of dominance within the sector, accountLng for 80-85 percent of
Chilets copper output. Two of the companies, Chuquicamata and El Teniente,
the largest open-pit and underground copper mining operations in the world,
respectively, presently account for over 75 percent of Gran Mineria produc-
tion. A third, El Salvador, contributes approximately 12 percent of Gran
Mineria production with two relatively new mines, Ex6tica and Andina,
accounting for the remainder. The Gran Mineriats operations are highly
mechanized and automated and are generally integrated operations from mining
through to refining.



- 8 -
23.      The medium-scale (Mediana Mineria) and small-scale (Pequefia
Mineria) mining operations account for the remaining 15-20 percent of Chile's
copper production.  The Empresa Nacional de Minerfa (ENAMI), the National
Mining Company, is the main purchaser of copper ore and concentrate from
the small mines and subsequently processes it in its smelting and refining
operations at Ventanas and Paipote. ENAMI also holds equity in some of
the medium-scale mining operations and provides some treatment of
semi-processed copper from the Gran Mineria operations. In addition to
ENAMI, there are several other producers of copper in the medium-scale
sector with the majority of them in the hands of private concerns. While
medium-scale mining has become increasingly capital-intensive since 1960,
small-scale mining is still heavily labor-intensive and is an important
source of employment for Chile's labor force, providing a living for
approximately 10,000 miners. Altogether, there are approximately 46,o00
persons employed in the copper sector.
24.        The Ministry of Mines has officiial jurisdiction over the develop-
ment of the copper sector. It is inadequately staffed, however, and has
traditionally played a weak role in coordinating sector planning and policy-
making. Since effective coordination and planning in the sector is important,
assurances were obtained during negotiations that, within a year of the
proposed loan agreement's signing, the Government would establish and maintain
an entity to control and coordinate planning and policy-making within the
copper sector (section 6.03 of the draft loan agreement).
The State-Owned Enterprises
25.        CODELCO grew out of the Departamento del Cobre, which had been
established in 1955 as an autonomous institution within the Central Bank
responsible for the monitoring of sales of all Chilean copper and for
supervising the regulations governing the use of domestic inputs by the
copper companies. After nationalization of the Gran Mineria operations in
1971, CODELCO assumed ownership and management of these operations, trans-
forming it into the largest copper producing company outside of the Soviet
Union. CODELCO and the operating companies suffered severely from the loss of
experienced professional staff, both in management and technical positions,
that has taken place since 1970. Only a fraction of this staff has returned
so that the training of younger staff has been given highest priority.
CODELCO's senior management is competent and has extensive technical and
executive experience in Chile's mining industry. It has proved remarkably
capable of managing the mining operations of the Gran Mineria and of bring-
ing about significant increases in output. Some problems do exist, however.
Legal ambiquities regarding the scope of CODELCO's authority, as well as
a tendency towards independent action at the level of the individual mining
companies, has limited CODELCO's general control over the mines of the
Gran Mineria. Moreover, the fact that the former foreign owners of the



mines usually took major financial and investment plan,ning decisions at
headquarters has left CODELCO with congenital deficiencies in these important
areas. The proposed project is designed to help overcome these difficulties
by providing for technical assistance to CODELCO. In addition, during
negotiations, assurances were received from the Government that, within a
year of the proposed loan agreement's signing, it would take all necessary
measures to mnerge CODELO and its five operating subsidiaries into a single,
fully integrated corporation with a central administration responsible for
planning, sales and purchasing but with the individual mines retaining suf-
ficient autonomyjto safeguard their operational efficiency (section 4t.02 of
the draft loan agreenent).
26.       The National Mining Company, ENAfI, was established in 1960 as
an autonomous state-owned enterprise with a major responsibility for the
development of Chile's small- and medium-scale mrining industry. EN:AK's
managerial and a&zinistrative staff is generally weaker than CODELCO's
though it has succeeded in retaining high quality technical staff at its
smelting and refining operations. like CODEIOO, it sm.ffered a significant
exodus of professional staff, especially between 1970 and 1973,
Recent Production Trends, Prospects and Etrategy
27.       As was stated above, the Chileanization propram of the 1960s was
intended to bring about a douoling of copper output to one million MT by
1970. This goal has yet to be reached. Unforeseen technical problems
encountered at some cf the mining operations, particularly at Exotica,
coupled with continuous labor unrest and a series of transport strikes
between 1970 and 1973 resulted in disappointing production figures.
Output in 1973 reached approximately 750,000 metric tons (MT), a major
shortfall from the targeted production of over one snillion MT and only 8
percent more than what was produced in 1970. In 1974, however, copper
production increased by 20 percent over the previous year and reached
102,000 MT owing prinarily to the absence of labor prcblems and to in-
creased productivity. Chile is currently the world's third largest pro-
ducer of copper--ranking behind the U.S. and the Soviet Union--and account
for about 12 percent of world mine production.
28.      Chile has large copper reserves estimated at between 20 and 25
percent of total world reserves; at an annual prodaction level of approxi-
mately one million MT, these reserves would last a 100 years. The
availability of extensive and relatively high grade ccpper deposits places
no technical limit on future copper expansion. Furthermore, Chile refines
a high proportion of its copper but does not facethe same environmental
constraints that exist in Japan, Canada and the U.S. tecause its rnining
and smelting operations are almost all located in sparsely pop-ulated,
desert regions. Its proximity to good shipping facilities and the high
qaality of engineers trained in Chilean universities are other factors
which give the country a comparative advantage in copper mining and pro-
cessing.



- 10 -
29.       Because of Chile's comparative advantage in copper production,
the industry's importance to the economy and its critical role in Chile's
balance of payments--copper accounts for 75 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings--the Government attaches the highest priority
to the sector and its investment needs. The principal constraints to
copper's future development are inadequacies in project preparation, a
lack of sectorial coordination and planning and the need for substantial
investment. Current projections tentatively call for an increase in
copper production from its present level of 902,000 MT in 1974 to 1.1
million MT by 1980. An estimated total investment of approximately US$900
million is planned between 1976 and 1980. Ninety percent of this invest-
ment would be earmarked to replace plant and equipment needed to maintain
existing production, and to expand smelter capacity, which is the principal
short-term constraint to increasing output.
Copper Exports, Prices and CIPEC
30.       Chile is a member of the Conseil Intergouvernemental des Pays
Exportateurs de Cuivre (CIPEC), a grouping of copper exporting nations
founded in 1967 which also includes Indonesia, Peru, Zambia and Zaire as
full-fledged members and Australia and Papua/New Guinea as associated
states. In 197h Chile was the world's second largest copper exporter--
slightly trailing Zambia--and its exports of 860,000 MT accounted for
about 20 percent of net world copper exports. Chile's copper markets
are well diversified with Japan, West Germany, the U.K. and the U.S.
being its largest customers and absorbing slightly more than half the
exports of Chilean copper.
31.       The world copper market is characterized by considerable price
instability which has serious repercussions on the Chilean economy in view
of its dependence upon copper export earnings. Despite violent fluctuations,
copper prices followed a long-term upward trend in real terms from 1929
through early 1974. Expressed in 1975 dollars, for example, they rose from
an average level of US$0.54/lb.   during the 1929-38 decade to US$0.69/lb.
during the 1949-58 decade and to US$0.82/lb. between 1959 and 1968. The
1969-73 average was also up, US$0.97/lb., and the price reached an all-
time high of US$1.52/lb., in current terms, in early April 1974. Since
then, copper prices have fallen sharply to below US$0.60/lb. in current
prices, mainly because of decreased demand resulting from a rapid slowdown
of world economic growth. In November 1974, the CIPEC countries agreed to
temporarily reduce their exports by 10 percent in an attempt to halt the
decline in copper prices. A further cutback of 5 percent was agreed to in
April 1975. Some of the major U.S. and Canadian copper companies have
also reduced production. In carrying out this cutback, Chile has shut
down the Ex6tica Mine--which was incurring substantial losses at the cur-
rently low copper price--until some technological problems which have come
up in processing its ore can be solved.



32.       In line with expectations of a gradual economic recovery in
industrial countries, copper prices should begin to move up from their
presently low levels during the second half of 1976. Once again using 1975
dollars, copper prices are expected to average US$0.74/lb. between 1976-80.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The Bankts first detailed review of the copper sector's develop-
ment needs was undertaken by consultants in July 1973 and was followed by
a further study in January 1974. The copper sector project was appraised
in stages from September 1974 through October 1975 and the missions'
report (602a-CH dated January 7, 1976) entitled "Appraisal of a Copper
Sector Project" is being distributed separately. Annex III contains a Loan
and Project Summary. Negotiation of the loan took place from December 15
to 19, 1975, and the Chilean delegation was headed by Col. Ruben Schindler,
Undersecretary of Mines, and included Messrs. Buttazzoni, CODELCO's Investment
Manager, and Soto, ENAMI's General Manager. The proposed project would be
the first Bank loan for copper mining in Chile, althoagh the IFC has had two
previous operations in the sector (see Annex II).
Project Description
34.       The proposed Bank loan would help finance several subprojects
selected from a sector investment program of high-priority needs for 1976.
The project's purpose is twofold: (i) to maintain, render more efficient
and, in a few cases, to slightly increase Chile's capacity to process its
copper ore and by-products; and (ii) to strengthen--through technical
assistance--the management of the executing agencies, CODELCO and ENAMI,
while also improving planning and policy maling within the sector. The
individual subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan include:
A.  The installation of an underground primary crushing
system, and related infrastructure, at CODELCO's El
Teniente Mine to treat the ore forthcoming from the
lower grade, primary ore zone which miners--after
70 years of exploitation--are now beginning to reach.
Unless this system is installed, the lower grade primary
ore which typically fractures, during blasting, into
chunks 30 to 40 inches in diameter (vErsus 13.5 inches
for the excellent, secondary zone ore, will require
additional blasting which is difficult. and costly.
Moreover, the minets productivity would decrease
drastically, i.e., from 250 tons per man-shift in the
secondary ore zone to 20-30 tons in the primary ore
zone.  This is the largest of the individual subprojects
and its total cost is estimated at USl`1.7 million.
Its foreign exchange component is expected to come to
US$7.5 million.

B. The rehabilitation of CODELCO' s Barquito Power Plant
which supplies the El Salvador mining, smelting, and
refining facilities. The subproject would involve
completing the replacement of the plant's old,
dilapidated power system by installing steam
generating units with a capacity of 15-20 MW. A
waste heat recovery boiler for the plant's existing
new gas turbine and a fuel preparation plant to
permit the gas turbine to burn heavy oil would
also be added. The installation of this equipment
would eliminate the danger of a plant shutdown due
to power failure--and the consequent loss of produc-
tion--as well as result in considerable fuel and
maintenance cost savings. The subproject' s total
cost is estimated at US$20.4 million and its foreign
exchange component at US$16.3 million.
C. Construction of a seleniurn recovery plant at
Chuquicamata aimed at the recovery of this metal
from the anode slimes in the Chuquicamata and El
Salvador copper refineries. The subproject's cost
is calculated at US$2.3 million and its foreign ex-
change component at US$656,ooo.
D.  The replacement of antiquated or obsolete equipment
at ENAMl's Paipote and Ventanas smelters--including
a blister copper caster for Paipote anda cathode cop-
per starter sheet machine for Ventanas--and the
modification of both smelterst bur-ners to enable them
to operate on Chilean coal as well as petroleum pro-
ducts. Replacement of the equipment is needed to
avert breakdowns and production losses and to lower
maintenance costs; moreover, it is urgent since spare
parts for the equipment are now hard to find. Modifi-
cations of the burners will give the smelters flexibil-
ity and permit them to burn the cheapest available
fuel at all times. This subproject's total cost is
estimated at US$3.9 million and its foreign exchange
component at US$3 million.



- 13 -
E.  Provision of technical assistance to aid in (i) the
preparation of a comprehensive smelting and refining
development strategy for the sector; (ii,' the prepara-
tion of long-term mining plans for the E] Teniente
and Chuquicamata mines; (iii) strengthening project
preparation and evaluation capabilities uithin CODELCO;
(iv) improving CODELCO's internal cost accounting,
inventory and budgetary control; (v) defining the role
of ENAMI in further expansion of the sma:!l and medium-
scale mining sector, and (vi) assisting ;he Government
in formulating an overall development str-ategy for the
sector while strengthening the coordinatLon of sector
planning. The total cost of this component would be about
US$5.4 million; US$5.4 million of this aiount would be in
foreign expenditures.
The subprojects would be carried out over a three year period running from
1976 through early 1979.
Cost and Financing
35.       The project's cost, net of taxes and duties, is estimated at
US$76.8 million. Its foreign exchange component is about US$33 million,
equivalent to 43 percent of net project costs and would be covered by
the proposed Bank loan. CODELCO would contribute US$142.9 million from its
own cash generation to cover the bulk of local expenditures. The remain-
ing local costs, about US$900,000, would be borne by ENAMI. In addition to
the amounts mentioned above, CODELCO and ENAFI~ would also provide approxi-
mately US$2 million to cover interest during construction.
36.       The proposed Bank loan to the Republic of Chile would carry a
term of 15 years, including 3 1/2 years of grace, and would bear an interest
of 8 1/2 percent. It would be relent to CODELCO and ENAMI~ (US$29.5b
million to the former and US$3.46 to the latter) with the same maturity
and grace periods but at an interest rate of 10 percent. A detailed break-
down of project costs and financing arrangements is 4iven in Annex III.
Financial Position of CODELCO and ENAMI
37.         The financial position of the two state enterprises deteriorated
considerably during 1970-73, mainly because of large wage and salary in-
creases, increased hirings, frequent work stoppages and the utilization of
an overvalued exchange rate for all copper transactions. ENAMI's financial
difficulties were compounded by a government pricing policy which required
ENAMI to purchase ore and concentrates from small- and mediumn-sized miners
at high prices which, in effect, constituted a subsidy. Although CODELCO
succeeded in maintaining a reasonably sound financial position, ENAIU in-



14 -
curred large operating deficits. There was a considerable improvement
during 1974 in both agencies' financial position as a result of increased
output, the elimination of the overvalued exchange rate applied to copper,
and of favorable world copper prices. In ENAMI's case, the Government also
reversed the earlier pricing policy and virtually eliminated ENAMI subsidies
to small- and medium-sized miners. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government that it would not modify MNAMI's present
pricing policy without prior consultation with the Bank (section 4.04 of
the draft loan agreement).
Project Execution
38.       Implementation of the individual subprojects will be carried out
by the engineering staff of the participating operating companies under
the overall supervision of CODELCO and ENAMI's management.   The operating
companies will be assisted by foreign experts and consultants who will be
primarily responsible for engineering, design and construction supervision.
The technical assistance for CODELCO and ENAMI will be provided by consul-
tants who will be recruited internationally and whose selection, terms and
conditions of employment will be acceptable to the Bank (section 2.02a of
the draft project agreements).
Procurement and Disbursements
39.       Items to be financed under the Bank loan will be procured
through international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Some of the small "off the shelf" items--whose cost is expected to come to
about 10 percent of the loan--may be procured through international shopping
after calling for bids from suppliers in at least three Bank member countries
and Switzerland. For purposes of bid comparison, the Bank's preferential
rules will be applicable to local and regional (Andean Group and Latin American
Free Trade Association) suppliers.
4o.       Disbursements for eligible project items under the proposed loan
would cover (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment and
materials or the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment selected
through international competitive bidding; and (ii) the technical assistance
component's foreign exchange costs. To the extent that Chilean suppliers
win orders under international competitive bidding, a small portion of the
loan may be disbursed against local expenditures although, as noted above,
the total amount of the loan is equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange
cost of the project.
Project Benefits and Justification
41.       The financial rates of return for the individual subprojects
are expected to range from 35 to over 50 percent. The economic rates of
return will be marginally higher than the financial ones since transfer



- i5 -
payments to the Government, apart from taxes, are not significant and more
than 95 percent of the copper will be exported at world market prices.
42.         Foreign exchange earnings stemming from project investments--due
either to averted production losses, as in the case of the critical rehabili-
tation components, or to increases in the output of processed copper or copper
by-products--are expected to rise to over US$100 million per annum by 1930.
The project will also yield other major benefits for the sector including
greater efficiency and lower operating costs, improved planning, project pre-
paration and implementation, and an enhanced absorptive capacity for future
investments. Combined, the benefits accruing from this project will help Chile
to maintain its strong competitive position amongst the world's copper producers.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.         The draft loan agreement between the Republic of Chile and the
Bank, the draft project agreements between the Bank and CODELCO and between
the Bank and ENAMI, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text cf a draft Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Besides the features mentioned elsewhere in this
report, the draft agreements conform to the usual pattern for loans in indus-
trial mining projects.
44.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VT - RECOMMENDATION
45.         I recommend that the Executive Directors auprove the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan No. 558    Second Highway Maintenance Project; US11.6 million Loan
of September 19, 1968, and US$1.6 million Agreement
amnending Loan Agreement of April 22, 1?74; Effective Date:
April 26, 1963, and June 21, 1974; Closing Date:   August
31, 1976.
Project execution started satisfactorily and contracts amounting to US$6.5
million were awarded for a major portion of the equipment list. This equip-
ment was put into operation immediately and contributes significantly to the
improvement of highway maintenance. The purchase of additional maintenance
equipment and spare parts has been substantially delayed, however, because of
cumbersome administrative procedures and a shortage of experienced personnel
in the Government's Highways Department since 1971. Implementation of the
project has been further hindered by severe budgetary cuts in the allocations
to highway maintenance programs since June 1974 as well as by restrictions in
hiring personnel for the public sector. It is now expected that the project
will be completed in the summer of 1976--about four years behind schedule.
Loan No. 666    Second Vocational Training Project; US$1.5 million Loan of
April 23, 1970; Effective Date: September 2, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1975.
Considerable time was lost initially due mainly to lack of local funds and
changes in the location of some training centers. Altogether, the project
slipped 30 months behind the schedule foreseen at the time of appraisal.
More recently, however, project implementation has proceeded satisfactorily
and the project is now substantially completed.
Loan No. 668    Third Education Project; US$7.0 million Loan of May 7, 1970;
Effective Date: October 21, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Project implementation has been hindered since the outset by a combination of
frequent changes in project unit directors and unstable conditions in the
construction industry since late 1971.   Rapid price escalation increased
construction costs and competitive bidding for construction works became
impracticable. The Bank agreed to accept a system of cost-plus fixed-fee
contracts as an emergency measure.  In March 1974 the new Government issued
/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in pro-
ject execution.

a decree which transferred all teacher-training to the universities. Since
no new construction of primary teacher-training colleges or modernization
of existing ones would be undertaken, the Government requested that result-
ing savings in the Loan be used to finance cost overruns elsewhere in the
rroject.  The corresponding amendment was signed in Oc-tober 197L|.  More
recently, in view of a lower than expected capacity in the public and private
sectors to absorb the initially planned number of graduates of the project's
11 agricultural schools, the Minister of Education has requested a second
amendment of the project to reduce the capacity of the schools to be con-
structed and/or remodeled.  His request is presently under consideration.
The project is expected to be completed by mid-1977, approximately three years
behind schedule.
Loan No. 688    Second Highway Construction Project; US$ 10.8 million Loan
of June 10, 1970; Effective Date: December 2, 1970;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
Substantial slippage occurred in starting construction of the project works.
This was due, initially, to delays in the prequalification of contrac-
tors and in the preparation of specifications, and later to numerous
changes of ministerial officials and technicians.   Competitive bidding became
difficult in an environment of rapidly rising inflation after 1971 and the
Bank agreed to proceed with a portion of the road construction on the basis
of negotiated contracts and works subdivided into small bidding sections.
It was also necessary to reduce the scope of the project and an amendment to
the Loan Agreement was signed in August 1974. Project works are now proceeding
more smoothly. Contracts have been awarded for the majority of the pending works
and invitations to bid will be issued for completion of bhe remaining works in
early 1976. The project is expected to be completed by mid-1977, about three
years behind schedule.
Loan No. 978    Technical Assistance Project; US$5.25 million Loan of April 22,
197T; Effective Date: July 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1977.
After a slow start due primarily to ineffective coordination of study preparation
among the various public sector agencies, project implementation has proceeded
more smoothly in recent months. The Loan's proceeds have now been fully commi-tted
to 13 preinvestment studies, all of which are now underway.   Approximately 21
percent of the Loan's funds have now been disbursed but, because of the delays
experienced in early groject implementation, the Loan's Closing Date has been
extended by 24 months to June 30, 1977.
Loan No. 1119   Agricultural Rehabilitation Project- US$20 million Loan of June 4,
1975; Effective Date:  September 23 1975; Closing Date:    Septem-
ber 30, 1976.
The Loan is progressing satisfactorily. Lending for short-term production credit
by one financial institution, the Banco del Estado, is already well underway and
US$8.1 million in Loan funds had been disbursed by November 30, 1975. It is
expected that lending by the Small Farmer Development Institute (INDAP) and the
National Development Corporation (CORFO) as well as by a few commercial banks
will soon commence. The Loan is expected to be fully disbursed before the end of
FY76.

for bids from suppliers in at least three Bank
member countries and Switzerland. For purposes
of bid comparison, the Bankts preferential rules
will be applicable to local and regional suppliers.

Technical Assistance:     CODEICO and ENAME would receive a total of
about 65 man years in technical assistance.
The consultants and experts for the technical
assistance components would be recruited in-
ternationally and their selection, terms and
conditions would be acceptable to the Bank.
Rates of Return:          The financial rates of return for the individual
subprojects range fromn 35 t) over 50 percent.
The econonic rates of returi will be marginally
higher since transfer payments to the Government,
apart from income taxes, ara not significant and
more than 95 percent of the copper is exported
at world market prices.
