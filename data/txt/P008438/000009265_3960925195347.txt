INDUSTRIAL EXPORT AND RESTRUCTURING PROJEc
(LOAN 2397-HI)
PRDFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) reviews the experience with
the Industrial Export and Restructuring Project for which a loan totalling
US$110 million (including the capitalized front-end fee of $0.28 million) was
approved on March 27, 1984. The main objectives of the project were to
support the Government's programs for industrial restructuring and expansion
and to strengthen the development banking role of the National Bank of
Hungary. The final disbursement was made in September 1989, and the loan
closed on December 31, 1989 as planned.
Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by Industry and Finance
Operations Division, Country Department IV, Europe,Middle East and North
Africa Region. They are based upon data supplied by the National Bank of
Hungary (NBH). Part II of the PCR was completed by NBH.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HUNGARY
INDUSTRIAL EXPORT AND RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
(LOAN 2397-SU)
EVALUATION SUMHARY
Obiectives
1.      The main objectives of the project (para. 3.1) were to support the
Government's programs for industrial restructuring and export expansion,
and to strengthen the development banking role of the National Bank of
Hungary (NBH). More specifically, the project was to assist Hungary to
diversify and expand exports of all but heavy industries (para. 2.4);
Increase industry's efficiency and competitiveness through material-saving
and technology upgrading investments, and through the promotion of "back-
ground industries" producing essential high technology components; and
strengthen the capacity of NBH and other institutions to formulate sub-
sectoral development strategies, identify, appraise and subsequently super-
vise projects, and support more effectively the Government's economic
reforms through appropriate investment and lending criteria.
Implementation Experience
2.      The project faced initial delays in loan utilization, due to pro-
curement problems (para. 5.1). The delays resulting from procurement were
mostly due to the borrowers' inexperience with the preparation of bid docu-
ments and their ex-ante review by the Bank, both of which took longer than
had originally been estimated. However, after training received by NBH in
loan appraisal and procurement, and training of staff of foreign trading
companies and borrowing enterprises in the Bank's procurement procedures,
the loan utilization and disbursements picked up. The final disbursement
was made in September 1989, and the loan closed on December 31, 1989 as
planned.
Results
3.      The investments made under the project were focused on export-
generation, material saving and technology upgrading of background indus-
tries. The benefits accrued have been tabulated in page 7 of Annex 2.
Although, the number of subprojects financed under the loan (26) was less
than anticipated, the total investments amounted to about 92? of the total
envisaged at appraisal. The overall economic and financial rates of
returns for 60? of the subprojects were better than anticipated at
appraisal (para. 6.1). Equally important as the investment projects are



- iv -
open and foreign markets without  ubsidies and grants, and relying on hard
financing sources (para. 6.2). Tne abolition of interest refunds and their
replacement by profit tax refunds for export and other priority projects at
the orsset of the project constituted a substantial policy improvement in
the structure of export Incentives (para. 6.3). The three subsector
studies that were carried out assisted the authorities in improving invest-
ment decisions and implementing viable development policies and strategies.
These studies were the basis for further lending to the Hungarian indus-
trial sector through two Bank funded loans (Fine Chemicals and Industrial
Restructuring II).
Sustainability
4.      The main achievements under the project, summarized in paras. 6.1-
6.3, are expected to continue. The main ,bjectives of the project, viz.
industrial restructiring, export expansion, promotion of background indus-
tries, and the strengthening of NBH and other institutions in investment
and lending criteria have been met. Hungary's on-going reforms of the
entire economic management system, especially industrial sector policy,
with support for specific restructuring investments, will help to sustain
the outcome of this project. Following along the lines of this project,
between 1986-89, three Bank loans for industrial restructuring (2700-HU,
2834-HU and 3020-HU)  -re approved i't support of industrial policy reforms
undertaken by the Government with the aim of restructuring of the indus-
trial sector to improve its international competitiveness. NBH's develop-
ment banking divisions were strengthened through the project. Subsequent-
ly, these divisions were separated from NBH and formed the core of the new
commercial banks which came into existence (para. 7.1).
Findings and Lessons
5.      The main findings and lessons learned appear in paras. 8 and 9 in
the Report. Given that Hungary was a new borrower, the Bank should have
paid more emphasis on procurement and dLsbursement concepts and operational
procedures, which would have eliminated the initial delays experienced.
The experience gained from this project confirms that the hybrid type of
approach to subproject appraisal where the Bank appraises a selected number
of subprojects and the remaining subprojects are appraised by participating
financial intermediaries, would be successful, especially in an environment
where the financial intermediaries are in the process of evolution (para.
8.2). For the concerned authorities the project highlighted the importance
of utilizing economic and financial analysis in subproject appraisal.
Until then, the concepts of investigation of alternatives, sensitivity
analysis and incremental analysis were not considered. This clearly
changed during project implementation and NBH staff utilized these concepts
successfully in all subproject appraisals (para. 9.2).

2. BACKGROUND
2.1         The development of the industrial sector has been the principal
driving force in the transformation of Hungary from a largely agrarian society
to a relatively modern economy in the space of three decades.
itdustrialization in Hungary has relied heavily on imported raw materials as
X:; country has few natural resources. Industry generates about 37Z of GDP,
provides over one-third of total employment and total gross capital formation,
and accounts for almost 70% of the country's exports. Industrial development
in the initial phase (1948-1967) was marked by rapid growth (about 7X per
annum in real terms) and was driven by the desire to attain early self-
sufficiency. Priorit, in resource allocation was, therefore, given to heavy
industry (essentially steel, chemicals and cement). However, as a result of
constraints on capital and labor availability which emerged in the late
1960's, the Government shifted in 1968 to a new industrial policy emphasizing
increased productivity and efficiency. While heavy industry has maintained
its dominance, a significant expansion has taken place in higher technology
industries such as pharmaceutical, telecommunications and electronic
equipment, and electrical engineering. The large investments made in some
heavy industries, particularly metallurgy, and petrochemicals, have not
produced the expected benefits, due mainly to adverse price and market
conditions.
2.2         The adverse trend of the late 1970's in the world economy, the
resulting deterioration in Hungary's terms of trade and increasing
difficulties for its exports have accentuated the major shortcomings of the
Hungarian industry. A conspicuous problem is the unusually high consumption
of raw materials and energy in the production process, particularly in heavy



- 2 -
industry. Other significant problems are the lack of specialization within
the industrial sector and the low rate of innovations to replace obsolete
products. Compounding these problems is the highly concentrated industrial
structure and lack of small and medium-sized firms which, in highly
industrialized countries, provide the larger enterprises with specialized or
innovative components and services of high technology and value.
2.3         At the time of the project Hungary had a relatively undeveloped
financial system with very limited money and capital markets. It had a
centralized banking system in which the national banking institutions served
as the key instruments for implementing economic olans and policies. Among
the eight Hungarian banking institutions, the St.~e Development Bank (SDB) and
the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) were by far the most important as suppliers
and regulators of investment finance. All state investments were channelled
through SDB. NBH is the central bank of the country, and also had a
commercial and development banking function (see para 5.5). In January 1987,
a competitive, two-tier banking system went into operation as part of the
e,onomic reform program.  As a result, NBH has given up its
commercial/deve'.opment banking role and concentrates only on central banking
and foreign currency activities.
2.4         The major thrust of the Government's new industrial policy was to
limit the intervention of the central author4ties and to create a conducive
*.nvironment, through the use of appropriate incentives and measures, within
which enterprises can operate efficiently. The Government was fully aware of
the weaknesses of the industrial sector and had expressed its determination to
press further with structural adjustments and the realignment of the sector to
the world market. In this respect it had three basic objectives. The first
was to expand industrial exports, focusing on domestic resource-based or high
value and skill-intensive areas (such as pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals and
engineering industries) in which Hungary generally has a comparative advantage
because of its technically competent managers and its highly skilled low cost
labor. The second was to conserve the use of raw materials and energy through
technological upgrading of production facilities, rationalization of product-
mix, and, if necessary, closing down of non-redeemable facilities. The third
was the promotion of "background industries" for the efficient import-
substitution of specialized components and parts required, particularly by the
engineering subsector.
3. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.1         The main objectives of the project were to support the
Government's programs for industrial restructuring and export expansion, and
to strengthen the development banking role of the National Bank of Hungary
(NBH). More specifically, the project was to assist Hungary to diversify and
expand exports of all but heavy irdustries (para 2.4); increase industry's
efficiency and competitiveness through material-saving and technology
upgrading investments, and through the promotion of "background industries"
producing essential high technology components; and strengthen the capacity of



NBH and other institutions to formulate subsectoral development strategies,
identify, appraise and subsequently supervise projects, and support more
effectively the Government's economic reforms through appropriate investment
and lending criteria.
3.2         The project components were selected based on studies conducted by
Hungarian authorities in selected subsectors in the context of the
Government's new industrial policy (para 2.4). Agreement was also reac..ed
with the Hungarian authorities to carry out studies for review of export
potential, and identification of subsectoral priorities during project
implementation, to bu&".d-up the sectoral underpinning of further Bank lending.
The project consisted of three main components: (a) a credit package of about
$38 million which would be onlent by NBH to eligible enterprises to finance
the foreign exchange costs of about 15 export-oriented and industrial
restructuring subprojects which were identified and pre-appraised by the Bank,
(b) two lines of credit to NBH, one for export promotion and the other for
industrial restructuring for a total of abontt $71 million to help finance
subpro'ects meeting agreed eligibility criteria; and (c) expert and advisory
services required for carrying out three subsectoral development strategy
studies (para 5.6), the feasibility study of a chemical project, possibly to
be financed by the Bank in the future, and institutional strengthening of NBH.
Annex 1 provides an overview of the project objectives and components.
4. PROJECT DESIGk AND ORGANIZATION
4.1         Due to the inadequacy of rigid central planning in an open economy
where a high share of GNP (about 50Z) enters into foreign trade, Hungary was
in the process of moving to a mixed system of market-oriented state ownership,
in order to realign the domestic economy, in particular its structure of
output, costs and prices, to the world environment and to avoid major
distortions in the allocation and use of its resources. Based on the work of
the first Bank economic mission (1982), the Bank concluded that it had a role
in assisting the Government in the pursuit of its restructuring objectives,
not only by augmenting scarce foreign exchange but also by enhancing
technology choices, by assisting Hungary's efforts to build bridges between
herself and western markets, and by offering advice on investment and policy
choices. The Industrial Export and Restructuring Project was one of the early
Bank operations in Hungary's indu.strial sector and followed the Industrial
Energy Diversification and Conservation Project (Loan 2317-HU, approved in
1983). Under these circumstances the project timing was very appropriate.
4.2         The project design emerged after considerable preparatory work,
the basis for which were the economic sector work,identification and pre-
appraisal missions. The selection of the components to be included under the
project was based on discussions held between the Bank and the Government
(para 3.2).



4.3         The project organization was based on the ability of the National
Bank of Hungary to on-lend the Bank furds under the various components. NBH
was staffed with high quality people but credit skills were weak; however,
technica'. assistance under the loan was prcvided to NBH to strengthen its
approach to, and procedures for, project appraisal and supervision. NBH was
involved to a great extent in the determination of the technical and marketing
viability of projects and was instrumental in systematic supervision of
project implementation and operation. The efficient manner in which the staff
of NBH monitored supervision of project implementation was the main factor for
completing this project on schedule.
5. PROJeCT IMPLgMENTATION
5.1         The project faced initial delays in loan utilization, due to
procurement problems. The delays resulting from procurement were mostly due
to the borrowers' inexperience with the preparation of bid documents and their
ex-ante review by the Bank, both of which took longer than had originally been
estimated. However, after training received by NBH in loan appraisal and
procurement, and training of staff of foreign trading companies and borrowing
enterprises in the Bank's procurement procedures, the loan utilization and
disbursements picked up. The final disbursement was made in September 1989,
and the loan closed on December 31, 1989 as planned.
5.2         The Credit Package.   Of the 15 pre-appr&ised subprojects, 14 were
completed on time and substantially within the original cost estimate. Of the
US$38 million that was allocated for this component, an amount of US$35.7
million was disbursed. They included seven export-generating and seven
material saving and background industries subprojects. These projects
consisted of extensions, rehabilitation, modernization and technology
upgrading of existing enterprises. One project was dropped as the enterprise
financed the cost out of its own funds.
5.3         The Credit Lines.   An amount of US$71 million was allocated to
NBH to finance two lines of credit for export expansion and industrial
restructuring subprojects, based on eligibility criteria agreed on by the Bank
and NBH. A total of US$72.3 million was disbursed covering 8 export and 4
material saving and background industries subprojects.
5.4         Sub-proiect Limits.   It was agreed at appraisal that the maximum
subloan amount under the credit lines would be US$10 million, although the
Bank reserved the right to approve larger amounts on an exceptional basis.
Three subloans were approved that exceeded the threshold limit. Of the 28
subprojects that were in the NBH pipeline at appraisal, it was estimated that
over 90X of them would have subloans under US$5 million each. However, due to
impending changes in Government policy with regard to incentives for the
industrial sector, many enterprises postponed their investment programs, as a
result of which many of the subprojects (especially restructuring) in the



original NBH pipeline were withdrawn by the sponsors.  These were replaced by
new subprojects with higher foreign exchange components. 12 subprojects were
financed under the lines of credit and 6 of them (including the three over
US$10 million) were over US$5 million each.
5.5         Institution-BuiUding Comgon_neL,.  In order to help NBH in its
project work, the loan financed the foreign exchange cost of expert services
for NBH and for training abroad of its staff. These two component. were
satisfactorily -ompleted. A manual covering project appraisal procedures and
supervision criteria in a comprehensive manner was developed by NBH with the
assistance of the experts, and approved by the Bank. In 1987, as a result of
the introduction of the two-tier banking system, NBH gave up its
commercial/development banking activities (para 2.3). Three new banks emerged
from the general credit sections of NBH and SDB. These banks were accepted by
the Bank to take over the loan portfolio of NBH related to this project, on a
provisional basis till eligibility criteria for participating banks were to be
finalized, and the loan agreements were amended accordingly. It was also
agreed that the new banks would make suitable arrangements for obtaining
technical assistance to strengthen their commercial banking activities under
other on-going Bank loans. These banks took over NBH's loan portfolio handled
by its general credit department prior to the break-up. As of January 1989,
there were 13 domestic commercial banks, 4 foreign commercial banks and 4
apecialized financial --titutes.
5.6         In order to assess the comparative advantage and export potential
of selected industries and to identify major constraints on their exports and
likely remedial policy measures, three subsector studies on pharmaceutical,
foundry and forging, and agricultural machinery were carried out under the
project. At the request of the Hungarian authorities, the Bank financed the
feasibility study fc: a large chemical project for the fabrication of methyl
diphenyl diisoyanate (MDI), a chemical material for the manufacture of
polyurethane foam which is used as an efficient insulation medium in industry
and construction. Two further Bank loans (Fine Chemicals Project- 2511-HU and
Second Industrial Restructuring Project - 2384-HU) used the resolts of these
studies.
5.7         The main risks confronting the project were essentially those
attached to a new Bank borrower, particularly in the use of new concepts,
approaches and operational procedures for implementing subprojects. However,
the high quality of NBH's staff and the experience they gained from the
training programs and experts' advice reduced the risks mentioned above
considerably and helped in the smooth implementation of the project. Actions
taken by the Bank through close supervision and project monitoring in the
early stages, especially in the quick approval of subprojects, helped
successful project implementation.
6. PROJECT RESULTS
6.1         The investments made under the project were focused on export-
generation, material saving and technology upgrading of background industries.



-6-
The benefits accrued have been tabulated in page 7 of Annex 2. Although, the
number of subprojects financed under the loan (26) was less than anticipated,
the total investments amounted to about 92% of the total envisaged at
appraisal. The overall economic and financial rates of returns for 60X of the
subprojects were better than anticipated at appraisal. The favorable results
are attributed to better prices and increased sales (e.g. due to increases in
domestic and CMEA sales Chinoin Pharmaceutical company was able to operate
three shifts as opposed to two shifts envisaged at appraisal). Depressed
prices, lack of demand (e.g. due to depressed demand in the agricultural
sector, Hungaria company's sales of PVC foil declined from the target expected
at appraisal by almost 80X) and long implementation periods (e.g. Papiripari
Vallalat, the paper company took five years to implement their project due to
changes in require  technology and delays in delivery of equipment) accounted
for the poor pern   ance of a few projects.  The outcome of the export
subprojects were v..oser to appraisal estimates than the restructuring
subprojects. This was partly due to the changes in subproject coc-position as
was explained in para 5.4. Annual sales at completion exceeded the estimates
at appraisal, while convertible exports met the specified targets. However,
annual savinr's on imports were far less than anticipated at appraisal mainly
due to the reason stated above, and as a result, the annual effect on trade
balance was about 601 of the anticipated target. Based on these figures, the
payback period of the Bank loan from profits is about 1.6 years.
6.2         Equally important as the investment projects are the non-
quantifiable benefits derived from the institutional-support components. The
project has achieved its aim of strengthening the institutional capability of
NBH to finance projects of enterprises that are viable on open and foreign
markets without subsidies and grants, and relying on hard financing sources.
As a result of the training and experience received from the project, NBH was
able to carry out comprehensive appraisals based on objective market reviews,
thorough technical and financial evaluation, and economic cost-benefit
analysis. The extensive project supervision systems and reporting
requirements introduced contributed greatly to timely completion of projects
and also minimized cost overruns. After NBH gave up its commercial and
development banking activities, most of the trained personnel of these
departments moved to the newly established commercial banks, enhancing these
banks' capabilities to on-lend resources based on sound investment decisions.
6.3          The abolition of interest refunds and their replacement by profit
tax refunds for export and other priority projects at the onset of the project
constituted a substantial policy improvement in the structure of export
incentives. Given the tight credit situation at the time, 25X self-financing
requirement induced financial discipline in the selection of priority projects
by the enterprises.   NBH's use of border and shadow pricing for economic rate
of return calculations in the appraisal of subprojects led to the selection of
most viable projects to reinforce the impact of the economic reforms'
objectives in the process of investment decision-making. The three subsector
studies assisted the authorities in improving investment decisions and
implementing viable development policies and strategies. These studies were
the basis for further lendin, _o the Hungarian industrial sector through two
Bank funded loans (Fine Chemicals and Industrial Restructuring II).

7. PROJECT SUSTAINABILIT
7.1         The main achievements under the project, summarized in the
preceding paragraphs, are expected to continue. The main objectives of the
project, viz. industrial restructuring, export expansion, promotion of
background industries, and the strengthening of NBH and other institutions in
investment and lending criteria have been met. Hungary's on-going reforms of
the entire economic management system, especially industrial sector policy,
with support for specific restructuring investments, will help to sustain the
outcome of this project. Following along the lines of this project, between
1986-89, three Bank loans for industrial restructuring (2700-HU, 2834-HU and
3020-HU) were approved in support of industrial policy reforms undertaken by
the Government with the aim of restructuring of the industrial sector to
improve its international competitiveness. NBH's development banking
divisions were strengthened through the project. Subsequently, these
divisions were separated from NBH and formed the core of the new commercial
banks which came into existence. With the training and experience obtained
under the project, the new commercial banks staffed with ex-NBH personnel are
in a better position to evaluate and appraise projects in the industrial
sector and to channel funds to priority projects to sustain industrial
restructuring and export expansion.
8. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.1         The Bank's performance was effective in the preparation,
implementation and supervision phases. The project objectives were
appropriate at this juncture in the Hungarian reform program, and the project
was processed in a relatively short period of time to respond to the
Government's requirements. The frequency and composition of supervision
missions were adequate throughout most of the project cycle. Although project
field supervision was affected by the Bank's reorganization in mid-1987,
implementation was closely monitored from Washington and on an ad hoc basis as
part of other missions. By 1987 all of the project components were fully
committed according to schedule. The training and the experience received by
NBH in project supervision and the close monitoring from Washington was
adequate to successfully complete the project on schedule.
8.2         The main lessons learned from the project that may be relevant
elsewhere are:
(i)   Given that Hungary was a new borrower, the Bank should have paid
more emphasis on procurement and disbursement concepts and
operational procedures, which would have eliminated the initial
delays experienced. The NBH and foreign trading companies and
borrowing enterprises, which were responsible for procurement,
needed more familiarity with preparation of standard bidding
documents and the Bank's procedures for procurement to be more
.ffective in the preparation of satisfactory tender documents and
bid evaluations. In this context, the Bank should have at the
onset of project implementation, organized seminars to instruct



8 -
the borrower and other concerned parties in the use of operational
procedures for procurement and disbursements;
(ii)  The experience gained from this project confirms that the hybrid
type of approach to subproject appraisal where the Bank appraises
a selected number of subprojects and the remaining subprojects are
appraised by participating financial intermediaries, would be
successful, especially in an environment where the financial
intermediaries are in the process of evolution.   Alternatively,
the Bank could have first provided only technical assistance to
NBH and onlent the funds after perhaps a year or so. But this
would have been time consuming. As part of the technical
assistance component, training was provided to NBH to strengthen
its approach to and procedures for project appraisal arid
supervision (para 4.3).   NBH based on agreed eligibility
criteria, and the experience gained on observing Bank appraisal
methodology, supplemented by training, was in a position
subsequently to effectively appraise projects on their own.
9. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
9.1         Overall performance of the Borrower and the concerned Government
agencies was good in all phases of the project cycle, after resolution of
initial problems arising from the lack of familiarity with the Bank's
procurement and other procedures.   The borrower complied with all the main
covenants. The performance of the borrower during project implementation was
especially good. In the past, credit requirements of enterprises were
determined on the basis of the annual investment plan approved by MOI and NPO
and credit was simply allocated without any real risk assessment of individual
loans by NBH. The Bank was of the opinion that it would take a long time for
NBH staff to acquire the professional skills and the attitude required for
successful project appraisal and assessment of associated risks. It would
seem that the effort and time required to move out of an allocative attitude
into a genuine "banking" approach was overestimated by the Bank. The high
quality and the absorptive capacity of the Hungarian counterparts were evident
in that the coverage, presentation and analysis of each succeeding subproject
showed improvement, and the same mistakes were seldom repeated if a discussion
was held in the field to point out specific deficiencies.
9.2         Main lessons of significance for the Borrower and the concerned
agencies were:
(i)   the importance of utilizing economic and financial analysis in
subproject appraisal. Until then, the concepts of investigation
of alternatives, sensitivity analysis and incremental analysis
were not considered. This clearly changed during project
implementation and NBH staff utilized these concepts successfully
in all subproject appraisals.
(ii) NBH staff also received training in project monitoring and
supervision, especially with regard to cost control and progress



reporting. As a result, most of the projects were implemented on
time and within the allocated budgets.
(iii) another important aspect was the training the Hungarian
counterparts received in international competitive bidding and
procurement procedures. Apart from the new concepts and ideas,
most enterprises were able to procure equipment and services at
much more competitive prices than before.
(iv) Hungarian authorities' subsectoral approach to improving
investment decisions and implementing viable development policies
and strategies was further strengthened by the subsector studies
carried out under the project. Their decisions based on the
outcome of the studies led to two on-going Bank projects (para
5.6).
10. PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
10.1        The working relationships between the Bank, the borrower (NBH),
and other agencies such as MOI were good at all times. Bank/NBH cooperation
was effective in all phases of the Project (i.e. appraisal, implementation,
and supervision).
11. CONSULTING SERVICES
11.1        NBH's approch and procedures for project work needed
reorientation to enable more comprehensive project appraisal and supervision
and, thus, to deepen its development banking role. In order to achieve this,
NBH retained the services of three Hungarian technical institutions to assist
NBH staff in the technical appraisal and supervision of projects, and the
Hungarian Institute for Economic and Market Research for market evaluation of
subprojects. NBH also obtained the services of a foreign expert in project
appraisal and supervision in order to assist in preparing and finalizing the
appraisal and reports of the initial five subprojects, strengthening NBH's
supervision procedures and helping NBH to draft the operational manual for
project appraisal and supervision. In all aspects both the local and the
foreign consultants performed satisfactorily and NBH benefited from the
experience it gained from dealing with the consultants. Further, Hungarian
institutions (some with foreign participation) were hired to carry out
subsector and project preparation studies in the pharmaceutical, farm
machinery, foundry development and the development of a MDI plant. These
studies were completed satisfactorily by the consultants and three of the
studies formed the basis for further Bank lending to the industrial sector
(para 5.6).
12. PROJECT DOCUMENTATION AND DATA
12.1        The legal agreements for the Loan provided a good basis for
supervision of the Project. At no time were there any disputes regarding
interpretation of any of the provisions. The Staff Appraisal Report provided
a continuing basis for monitoring the progress of the Project. Information



- 10 -
from the project files and that provided by NBH were more than adequate for
supervision purposes and to prepare the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLElON REPORT
HUNGARY
INDUSTRIAL EXPORT AND RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
(LOAN 23974lW)
PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.1         The industrial Export and Restructuring Project aimed at providing
funds for financing investments resulting in increasing of convertible
currency earnings either directly or indirectly via restructuring the
operation of the company. The Project's objectives were fully in line with
the main goals of the Hungarian government, namely to provide support for the
restructuring of the economy and within that of the industrial sector. The
different elements of the project - investments with a view to increase the
share of exportable production, upgrade the product mix and efficiently
substitute certain products previously imported from convertible currency area
due to the lack of feeder type activities or make substantial savings in input
material - perfectly covered areas that were considered at high priority in
the credit policy of NBH. The project's objectives were met since the
capacities that were created with the help of the World Bank contributed to
the achievement of a higher value added industrial output; and as a
consequence resulted in better export performance of the sector.
2.    PROJECT BENEFITS
2.1         Looking at the project's benefit from the enterprises point of
view, there is clearly more than simply the direct technical and financial
results springing from specific investments. This project was among the first
World Bank financed operations in Hungary so the project beneficiaries had to
get acquainted with new approaches and methods as to project preparation and
implementation (including goods procurement). These techniques and procedures
related to development activities are used by most of the companies ever since
regardless of the source of financing. In some cases subprojects financed
under this loan were followed by other - even more complex - operations
financed from subsequent World Bank loans for industrial restructuring.
Consisting of two parts - one for preappraised projects and another for
projects selected and appraised by the Hungarian counterpart - the project
offered an excellent opportunity for the proliferation of appraisal methods
not widely used previously while making decisions on loans. At the time of
the Project's appraisal and throughout the first years of implementation -
before the establishment of the two-tier banking system - the appraisal of
investment project was executed by the National Bank of Hungary. The staff of
NBH was provided with considerable training in project appraisal that proved
to be very efficient. The reflection of the beneficial effect of the training
is manifested in the results of the non-preappraised projects that proved to
be somewhat more advantageous than the average of all the subprojects of the



- 12 -
operation. This can also be demonstrated by the figures in Part III of the
present PCR. We would like to mention here that the data contained in the
third part of the report are accurate and adequately reflect facts and results
related to the project.
During the implementation of the project major changes occurred in
the Hungarian financial sector, namely a two-tier banking system came in to
existence. The new commercial banks took over the ongoing projects previously
appraised by NBH and some of the subloans were concluded after the
establishment of these banks. New banks took over loan officers from NBH who
had received training so they assured continuity and consistency as far as
appraisal procedures were concerned. Not only did the credit manual
elaborated in the context of the project serve as a basis for appraisal of new
subprojects under this loan but it is widely used in the evaluation process of
investment lending operations.
3.    PROJECT RELATIONSHIP
3.1         The relationship between the Bank and the Hungarian counterpart
was always very good throughout the preparation and implementation of the
project. The Bank's performance was effective during all the phases of the
project. Hungarian institutions, being not very familiar with World Bank
procedures, received a lot of assistance especially in the initial phase of
the implementation. Nevertheless in certain instances a slightly bigger
flexibility in the approval of bidding documents could have accelerated the
implementation of the subprojects concerned. Fortunately this problem has now
been practically eliminated with the elaboration of sample bidding documents.
3.2         To sum up the project turned out to be a very successful operation
resulting in the increase of higher value products that can be sold on
convertible currency markets. Investments financed under the project proved
to be more efficient than the average of Hungarian company investments. The
foreign exchange cost of the project is recovered in less than two years so
these investments have been contributing to the improvement of the trade
balance in conv-,rtible currencies.
