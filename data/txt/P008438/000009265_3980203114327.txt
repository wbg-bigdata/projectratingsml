HUNGARY
INDUSTRIAL EXPORT AND RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTICN
1.01     The following report appraises a project for Industrial Exports and
Restructuring, which the Government of Hungary asked the Bank to finance; the
identification, pre-appraisal and appraisal missicns visited Hungary in Octo-
ber 1982, February and May 1983 respectively.  The proposed project consists
of a loan to the National Bank of Hungary (NBR) to finance investments, stu-
dies and institutional-building assistance. Its main objective is to support
the Government's priority objective of strutetural adjustment in industry,
through the development of more efficient and higher value-added industries
able inter alia to export a major share of their output to convertible
currency markets.
1.02     The proposed loan of US$110 million to NBH would finance the foreign
exchange components of a group of pre-appraised subprojects (credit package of
up to US$38 million), of sub-projects to be financed during 1984-1986 under
lines of credit totalling US$71 million, and of expertise and advisory
services required for subsector studies, project preparation studies and
institutional-strengthening of NBH's Credit Departments (up to US$0.725
million). Subprojects would be divided between these:
(a) for expanding exports to convertible currency markets, with a total
allocation of US$73 million; and
(b) for industrial restructuring (material-saving, technology transfer
and "background" industries), with a total allocation of US$36
million.
The loan would also finance the capitalized front-end fee of about US$275,000.
1.03     The total cost of the project with a direct convertible currency cost
of US$110 million is estimated at US$257.5 million (including permanent
working capital, contingencies and interest during construction). The project
would encompass part of NBH's lending program for 1984-1986. The proposed
Bank loan would finance 43% of the total project cost; internal generntion
funds of sub-borrowers would provide at least US$65.5 million, and the balance
of about US$82 million will be provided by NBH's local currency loans to
finance local and indirect foreign exchange costs.  In the event co-financing
is mobilized for the project, the project scope would encompass a larger
portion of NBH's lending program for 1984-1986, and co-financing would cover
the additional convertible currency cost and NBR's local currency loans.

I I.  '[Hl, IND.USTRIAL SECTOR
The Sconomic Environment I/
2.01     Following a program of fundamental reforms first introduced in 1968,
Hungary is currently shifting to a mixed system of market-oriented state
ownership, in order to align the economy to the world environment and to avoid
major distortions in the allocation and use of its resources.  The system has
evolved from the post-war period when planning was fully centralized and based
on physical targets for gross output and central administrative directives.
In the ongoing structural adjustment which has been the outstanding objective
of the Government since the first economic reforms of 1968, central planning
is becoming conf ined to large infrastructure-type investments of the State
financed by budget appropriations and loans and grants from the State Develop-
ment Bank (SDB), and to the use of "economic regulators" such as taxes (and
subsidies whenever necessary), interest rates, credit allocation, wage arnd
price policies; the process for planning and managing other productive activi-
ties is being decentralized, at times with internal inertia and delays,
towards market-oriented and incentives-driven enterprises free to make their
own investment decisions. The new incentives and economic regulators for
industry, in particular the credit allocations controlled by the National Bank
of Hungary (NBH), are designed to promote and support the Government's priori-
ty objective for the development of more efficient and higher value-added
activities able to export an increasing share of their output to convertible
currency markets. This will require further progress in the ongoing institu-
tional reforms and in the reallocation of resources towards industrial activi-
ties with a comparative advantage; it will also need foreign exchange resources
required to upgrade many industrial plants and introduce the modern technolo-
gies which can make the most effective use of Hungary's highly skilled labor.
Structure and Performance
2.02     The industrial sector (comprising, according to Hungazy's definition,
manufacturing, mining and power) has been the leading sector of the economy
for the last thirty years. It represents now 40% of GDP, and over one third
of total employment and total Gross Capital Formation.  Some 22% of industrial
output are exported, accounting for 75% of the country 's exports.  Half of
industrial exports are sold in convertible currencies.  The sector is composed
essentially of 725 state enterprises and of 635 cooperatives; the latter repre-
sent 6% of industrial output and 14% of industrial employment.
2.03     Hungary has few natural resources as raw materii s for industry,
limited to small reserves of iron ore and petroleum and natural gas, and large
deposits of bauxite and coal. Industrialization in Hungary has thus relied
heavily on imported raw materials. Industrial development went through a
first phase (1948-1967) of rapid industrialization for self-sufficiency,
whereby capital and labor resources were mainly allocated to heavy industry
(essentially steel, chemicals, cement). In this period, industrial output
growth averaged about 7% p.a. in real terns. Constraints on capital and labor
availability emerged in the late 1960s, and the Government shifted in 1968 to
a new industrial policy aiming at increased productivity and efficiency of
production factors.

2. -'4    Major changes have recently occurred in the industrial structure.
While basic heavy industry 1/ has maintained its dominance, a significant
expanaion has taken place in higher technology industries such as pharniaceu-
ticals, telecommunications and electronic equipment, and electrical engi-'
neering. Gross industrial production grew at 6.4% between 1970-75; growth
fell to 3.4% dtiring 1976-80 and to some 2% in 1981-82. Convectible currencv
exports of industry maintained in 1981 and 1982 a level of US$2.85 billion.
Through constraints on domestic consumption and investment and a major export
drive, a total trade surplus of US$508 million was achieved in 1982 compared
with US$39 million in 1981. Total exports of transport equipment and other
capital goods rose by 15% over the 1981 level of US$2.2 billion, while export
of industrial consumer goods rose by 37% over the 1981 level of US$1.4
billion. Exports of textiles and metallurgical products slightly declined.
Recent trends in the industrial structure are summarized in the table below.

Constraints on Industry's Performance
2.06     The adverse world economic trends of the late 1970s, resulting in a
deterioration of Hungary's terms of trade and in increasing difficulties for
Hungarian exports on the foreign markets, have underlined the major short-
comings of the Hungarian industry which are:
a.   an unusually high consumption of raw materials and energy in the pro-
duction processes, due to the continued operation of old inefficient
units (in heavy industry in particular) and to constraints on the
transfer of some modern technologies;
b.   the lack of specialization within the overconcentrated industrial
fabric and a low rate of innovations to replace obsolete productions,
stemming from the planners' bias for gross output and the enter-
prises' bias for extensive product-mix; and
c,   insufficient reallocation of producti n factors to efficient indus-
tries, resulting from the slow respons veness of industry to the new
economic mechanisms and policies.

2.07     The still prevailing focus of enterprises' management on maximizing
gross output, at times through obsolete or unbalanced technclogies, have
resulted in excessive consumption of raw materials and energy in industry,
particularly in some heavy industries.  Due Largely to the priee readjustments
of energy supplies and related raw materials in 1980, intermediate consumption
costs have increased over 1979-1981 from 70% up to 85% of total output value
in metall4rgy and chemical industries, and up to 78% on average over the
manufacturing sector, but consumption of raw materials and energy in real
terms has started to decrease in 1981 and 1982.  This pattern is summarized in
the table below.

Source. Annex 3
2.08     One factor hampering the responsiveness of industry to economic
reforms and market signals is the high degree of concentration in Hungarian
industry by international standards. Over 80% of the industrial labor force
is employed in enterprises having more than 1,000 employees, and one-third of
the labor force is concentrated in 38 enterprises, each employing more than
5,000 workers. About 100 enterprises provide over 60% of industrial output.
There is evidence that the degree of industrial concentration has not been
conducive to economic efficiency, due to the inertia shown by larger organi-
zations in response to changes in the business environment.
2.09     As a result, Hungary lacks a dense fabric of small/medium firms
which, in highly industrialized countries, provide the large enterprises with
specialized or innovative components and services of high technology and
value. The production of such goods and components has been neglected in
investment planning, and the end-products incorporate not only raw materials
of uneven quality but also substantial amounts of out-dated l/ or poor quality
components and parts, making them less marketable for exports. Moreover, the
expansion of exports has led to an increasing and costly reliance on high
1/ Even in subsectors with successful exports of high technology goods (e.g.,
pharmaceuticals), there is evidence that the rate of introduction of new
products is too low. In 1980 only 6% of pharmaceutical exports came from
products introduced in the previous 5 years.



technology components imported Mostly from convertible currency markets
(imports of semi-finished goods and parts represent one-third of total
imports). The engineering industries, which export a record 40% of their
output, have been particularly affected by the lack of specialized/
subcontracting enterprises providing parts and components (called in Hungary
"background industries"), and exhibit substantial gaps in their production
structure (including precision castings and modern forging facilities).
Economic Policies and Industry
2.10     The exchange rate was unified in 1981 for convertible currency trans-
actions. Moreover, a system of taxes and subsidies was introduced to match
the prices of goods traded with Socialist countries to world market prices;
thus industries using these goods pay world market prices irrespectAve of the
souzce of supply.
2.11     The pricing policy currently prevailing is detailed in Appendix I.
Its basic principle, in line with the economic reform objectives, is8 to align
domestic prices and production costs to international conditions, thus reflec-
ting relative scarcities and encouraging exports and efficient import substi-
tution. The domestic prices for users of raw materials and energy supplies
are set at the actual or potential convertible clrrency import price. The
actual or potential import price sets the upper limit for the prices of manu-
factured goods sold only on the domestic market. Enterprises which sell at
least 5% of their output to convertible currency markets receive for their
exports the actual prices in foreign ;xchange (minus the comnercial costs
charged by the foreign trading companies); their domestic prices are set so
that the average domestic profitability does not exceed the profitability of
convertible currency exports and domestic prices do not exceed the import
prices of goods of equivalent quality. Some 80 percent of industrial produ-
cers' prices are presently unconitrolled and determined by competitive fac-
tors.  However, the extent to which the price system is applied anid effective
in driving industries to export and to efficient resource allocation is not
clear, and the Government is considering further improvements to its pricing
policy.
2.12     The wage policy, which is closely tied to the price policy is used as
an incentive for productivity and inter-sectoral reallocation of labor. Basic
wages, which are low and relatively evenly distributed (betweei UStl00 and
U$140 per month for skilled workers), are complemented by bonuses and wage
increases provided by the enterprises' "sharing funds" which are financed out
of the enterprises' profits.
2.13     While there is evidence of labor hoarding in certain subsectors (e.g.
iron and steel). other industries have faced labor shortages since the early
1970s.  The textile industry, for instance, lost 40% of its labor force in the
last decade, but has increased the volume and quality of total output by the
introduction of modern, labor saving technologies (mainly of Western origin)
and by better work discipline. rhe improvement of labor productivity through
the introduction of new technologies, to a large extent obtained from
developed countries, is a major element of the government's industrial policy,



- 7 -
and the extension of the "second economy" 1/ into the industrial sector may
produce opportunities for increased efficiency of labor.
2.14     The credit policies have been vsed by t'hie GoveruLment as an economic
regulator to orient investments to priority objectives and areas. Lending
terms and conditions were considerably tightened, The SDB is increasingly
providing funds in the fonm of loans rather than grants; interest rates were
frequently increased in the past yedrs, standing now at 14% for NBH credits
and 13% for SDB loans; and interest rebates used to be granted onily to
priority projects and ex-post after the projects have met their planned
targets (see Chapter III). The system of intertst rebates war reviewed by the
authorities and was abolished from January 1, 19.z4. Industrial credit of NBH
is presently restricted to energy-saving, export generation, or material-
saving/recycling projects with short pay-back periods and high economic
returns. Moreover, fiscal policies (e.g. a 25% investment tax on all
investments except in priority areas) have been used to control the level of
enterprises' investments and to reorient them to the priority areas. As a
consequence, industrial inveat:nent fell significantly from Fts 80.5 billion
(US$2.85 billion) in 1978 and 1979 to Fts 66 billion (US$1.92 hillion) in 1981
and Ft 69 billion (US$1.88 billion) in 1982; the share of state grants in
total financing decreased from 21% to 12%, and the aft*er tax profits allocated
by the Enterprises to their1)evelopment Funds have been financing a growing
share of investment now accounting for 40% of industrial investment (Annex 4).
2.15     Economic management policies have aimed at restri^ting the interven-
tions of the central authorities to the determination of policies, incentives
and institutional framework for the enterprises.  Central plann.ing methods are
now used only for large state projects (mostly in mining aad energy) which
represent one-third of total industrial investments.  The management of enter-
prises has been decentralized, more driven by fiscal and salary incentives,
more oriented towards the market, and given autonomy in the initiation of
capital investment. In order to further encourage competition and specializa-
tion among industrial enterprises, the authorities disbanded in the Late 1970s
most of the large industrial trusts. Restructuring of industry is further
encouraged through increased promotion o., and emphasis or, domestic technital
innovation, transfer of foreign technology, and cooperatiQn agreements with
western industties, which are of particular value to export-oriented enter-
prises. Moreover, domestic enterprises are being authorized to sell directly
abroad and create their own export marketing units, thus removing the foreign
trade companies' monopolies in import. and export transactions.
Investment and Export Objectives
2.16     The Government has been fully aware of the weaknesses of the indus-
trial sector and the shortcomings of its policies, and has expressed its
determination to press further for structural adjustments and realignment of
the sector to world markets. This is a pressing necessity, in view of the
1/ Legitimate private activity, termed the "second economy", has been exten-
sive in agriculture and services. Recently industrial workers have been
officially encouraged to form cooperatives for utilizing the plant and
equipment after hours for their own benefit. This both increases the
amount and range of specialized parts, components and services, but also
adds to personal incomes at a time when wages are being restrained.

overhang of debt service payments which will bulge by the mid eighties. The
basic objectives of the ongoing programs for industry are:
(a)  further expansion of industrial exports, with focus on resource-based
or high value and skill-intensive productions where Hungary generally
has comparative advantages (food industries, aluminum products, phar-
maceuticals and fine chemicals, engineering industries);
(b)  savings of raw materials and energy in industrial production, through
technological up-arading of production facilities, rationalization of
product-mix, and, if necessary, closing down non-redeemable facili-
ties; and
(c)  promotion of "background" industries for the efficient import-
substitution of specialized components and Darts (in the engineering
industries in particular).
2.17     Following the substantial investment cuts made during 1980-1982 in
order to reduce domestic demand and reestablish external balance, the Govern-
ment considers,that its recessionary policy cannot be pursued for too long and
that investment should be maintained at levels in line with past achievements.
Though investment targets and allocations by subsectors and objectives are not
known for f-.ture years, most future indusWrial investment will remain oriented
towards the priority objectives of energy-saving/substitution and export gene-
ration. Industrial investment is projecLed to remain at the 1982 level in
1983 and decrease slightly in 1984, reaching then at least Forints 64 billion
(US$1.4 billion); 1984 investments would decrease most markedly in the metal-
lurgy and chemical industries subsectors. In 1984, a minimum of Forints 30
billion (US$0.67 billion) would be invested in ongoing industrial projects, of
which Foriats 20 billion (US$0.44 billion) for energy related projects.
Currently no new industrial projects are being started under the State Budget,
with the exception of those included in the Industrial Euergy Diversificatiosk
and Conservation Program and under the NBH's Energy Ration.dlization and Export
Generation Credit Facilities. The allocations of NBH funds to the Export
Generation credit line would average at least Forints 10 billion (US$220
million) p.a. during the period 1983-1985. Other prioLiLy investments of
smaller magnitude such as material-savings projects and development of back-
ground industries could total up-to Forints 4 billion (US$100 million) per
annum.
2.18     The basic comparative advantage of HungaTy in its switch to modern
industrialization and to exports has been its technically competent managers
and its highly skilled and low-cost labor. Skilled workers constitute 38% of
industrial employment, and upper technicians another 9%; these shares are
higher in the engineering industries. Moreover, applied research and develop-
ment in industry employs some 40,000 persons (2.5% of total industrial employ-
ment) and represents an annual investment of about Pts 10 billion (US$250
million). Direct and indirect labor costs represent some 25% of the total
value of exports.  The development programs emphasize subsectors where Hunigary
generally possesses a comparative advantage and where technological skills
play a major role. These subsectors include pharmaceuticals and other high



-9-
value chemicals, certain engineering branches (notably transport equipment
such as buses and port equipment:, electronic a.sd texecommunications equip-
ment), and the food processing industry. A second set of subEectors where
Hungary could develop a competitive edge in exports includes finished aluminum
products, precision machine tools, instruments and medical equipment.
2.19     The trade flow in convertible currencies is the most important for
the stability and the growth of the economy. Hungary lhas achieved commendable
success in that the peak convertible trade deficit of US$780 million in 1978
was transformed into a convertible surplus of US$445 million in 1981 and of
US$766 million in 1982. However, this does not reflect totally the ability of
the industry to compete in the Western markets. Firstly, about one quarter of
convertible currency exports were earned from above-quota exports of raw mate-
rials and supplies to Socialist countries paid for in convertible currencies.
Secondly, semi-finished goods and processed food products account for as much
as half of total exports to non-Socialist countries, and manufactured gooda
and parts only for 36%, whereas more than 70% of imported spare Parts and
manufactured products are paid in convertible currencies. These disparities
highlight the need to upgrade the technological content and the product range
of Hungarian convertible currency exports and to improve the efficiency of
input use, if the exporting enterprises are to increase their penetration of
Western markets.
2.20     Some steps have already been taken to adjust the structure of indus-
trial production and to promote these subsectors with a perceived comparative
advantage. Within chemical industries, petrochemicals have been reduced and
pharmaceuticals increased; in the metal industries, exports of steel products
were cut back, and those of engineering industries raised. In order to align
the range of exported products with the export market needs, programs to
improve auality standardo, introduce new technologies, promote material-
savings and develop background industries were established (Appendix II).
Because of the current liquidity and foreign exchange constraints, these pro-
grams have given so far precedence to small and quick-yielding projects. But
the programs will also require major investment in equipment and technology
from abroad.
Bank Lending t- Industry
2.21     The Bank can assist the Government to achieve its structural adjust-
ment program by providing foreign exchange for investment financing and by
supporting through its leans the Government's efforts to implement the insti-
tutional and policy reforns underway. The following country objectives should
be supported by the Bank lending program for industry;
(a)  Export-Generation and Expansion in the convertible currency area
would counteract the deterioration iLi Hungary's terms of trade, and
would focus on subsectors with comparative advantages and on raising
the value-added and net foreign exchange content of exports;
(b) Material and Energy-Savings through plant upgrading and technology
transfer would constitute a highly significant area for increased
efficiency and competitiveness and for foreign exchange savings;



- 10 -
(c) Background Ii.dustries promotion and development would fill a criti-
cally missing link in the industrial structure for high value and
technology-based components in industrial production and hard-
currency expor'-t, and would support effectively the new policies for
enterprise deconcentration and autonomy in the sector; and
(d) Institutional and Policy Improvements, in the financial sector and
NBH particularly, would introduce in the procedures currently pre-
vailing in Hungary some firmer and Government-supportive guidelines
on investment and lending decision criteria.
2.22     Bank lending to Hungarian industry will focus primarily on industrial
restructuring via energy-conservation, development of new exports and effi-
cient use/conservation of miaterials through technology up-grading, and
strengthening of the industrial fabric. A first Bank project for Industrial
Energy Conservation and Diversification was approved in June 1983. The present
project would address the four objectives (a) to (d) above through a multi-
component loan to NBH.

IIT. FINANCIAL SECTOR AND CREDIT POLICIES
The Institutional Framework
3.01     Hungary has a relatively undeveloped financial structure, with very
limited money and capital markets. It has a centralized banking system in
which the national banking institutions serve as the key instruments for
implementing economic plans and policies. Among the eight Hungarian banking
institutions 1/, the State Development Bank (SDB) and the National Bank of
Hungary (NBH) are the main sources of governmental investment finance for the
productive sectors.
3.02     The SDB was established in 1972 to take over the tasks of the former
Hungarian Investment Bank. It is responsible for the preparation, financing
and supervision of a-l state investments of national scale or programs of
national interest which do not come under the control of local councils (e.g.,
housing). The SDB finances large, centrally managed investment projects which
are a direct part of the state budget and can also fund enterprise-initiated
projects; such projects are often in mining, energy, infrastructure, or the
production of key raw materials and intermediate inputs. In addition to its
main role in financing these investments, the SDB also provides loans, grants
and/or risk capital outlays for productive enterprise-initiated investments.
SDB loans are usually made to enterprises that need additional investment
resources but cannot meet the tight eligibility criteria of the NBH. Their
terms are somewhat scfter than those for NBH credits. The SDB can also pro-
vide outright grants or subsidies to non-productive investments judged to be
in the public interest and can combine its grants with NBH credits either to
supplement or to substitute for an enterprise's insufficient financial resour-
ces. The SDB recently initiated a third form of enterprise-investment finan-
cing, designed to reduce outright grants and to increase enterprise responsi-
bility for investment performance. It can now provide interest-bearing risk
capital for profitable investments to enterprises with difficult financial
problems in their overall operations 2/. However, there has been a drastic
cut in SDB investments in the manufacturing sector in recent years in confor-
mity with the decline in state loans and grants (para 3.05).
1/ The other six banking institutions are the National Savings Bank, which
provides home-building financing and loans to small industrial coopera-
tives and private industry; the Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank Limited,
which affects investments through its eontrols on import and export
licenses; the Central Bank of Exchange and Credit Limited, which manages a
recently created pilot fund (Ft 600 million for three years) for the
promotion and financing of Hungarian inventions; the Central Corporation
of Banking Companies; the General Banking and Trust Company Limited, and
the Insurance Enterprise of the State. In addition, while operating under
an off-shore status, the Central European International Bank Limited, which
is an international bank with 34% Hungarian shares, also plays a minor role
in providing short- and medium-term working capital to Hungarian industrial
enterprises.
2/ Although interest rates on the SDB's risk capital allocations are higher
than those on state loans or NBH credits, eventual losses, if any, are
borne by the SDB and not the enterprise. In 1981, Ft 800 million ($20
million) were allocated for this new form of SDB financing compared to
about Ft 9 billion ($225 million) for state loans and grants to
enterprises.



- 12 -
3.03     The NBH (see Appendix III) was formed as a joint stock company in
1924 and has been wholly owned by the state since 1967. The NBH is both the
central bank of Hungary, a development bank and a commercial bank. As part of
its central bank functions, it administers all gold, foreign exchange and
exchange rate policies, issues banknotes and coins, and is the main banker for
the state, state enterprises, cooperatives and other banking institutions.  It
also formulates the Credit Guidelines which are approved annually by the
government and which set the terms and conditions for short- and long-term
lending for the NBH and the other Hungarian banking institutions. As a comr
mercial bank, the NBH transacts all payments, credits and operations connected
with foreign trade, including the financing of imports, since Hungarian enter-
prises usually do not directly accept foreign credit or raise foreign loans.
As a development bank, it provides shortand medium-term working capital and
investment credits to creditworthy enterprises and cooperatives for profitable
purposes consonant with the national economic plan. Transactions between
enterprises and those between enterprises and the government are conducted
through demand deposits held in the NBH, while transactions between enter-
prises and households and within the household sector are entirely in cash
terms. The NBH thus has a key function in the system. In recent years, it
has pursued an increasingly active credit policy, including changes in the
cost of credit. In making credit allocations, the NBH has increasingly
examined profitability of enterprises and their efficiency in resource utili-
zation. There remains some need and scope for further enhancing the NBH
capability for project appraisal and supervision (see paras. 3.18 and 3.19).
Investment Financing
3.04     The responses to Hungary's balance of trade and economic difficulties
which started in 1977 have resulted in significant changes in irLvestment poli-
cies and the pattern of investment in the productive 1/ vis-a-vis the non-
productive sectors. The overall investment has fallen from Ft 397.6 billion
in 1978 (US$5.2 billion) to Ft 184.7 billion (US$5.0 billion) in 1982; the
decrease in the productive sector  was from Ft 160.2 billion to Ft 148.6
billion (from US$4.2 to $4.0 billion) during the same period.  The share of
the manufacturing sector in total investment decreased from 31% in 1978 (Ft
60.5 billion or US$1.6 billion) to 24% in 1982 (Ft 45.2 billion or US$1.2
billion).  Nevertheless, investments by enterprises from their own internal
sources are steadily growing, from Ft 40.9 billion (US$1.1 billion) in 1978 to
Ft 73.1 billion (US$2 billion) in 1982, and now account for 49% of the total
investment in the productive and the manufacturing sectors.
3.05     State loans ar- arants (wrade through SDB) financed 22% of productive
sector investments in 1982, compared to 41% in 1979.  This cutback was almost
entirely the result of an overall drop in state grants to the productive
sectors and to manufacturing in particular. State loans and grants were only
13% and 3% respectively of total investment in the manufacturing sector in
1982, and the metallurgy sub-sector was the main beneficiary.
3.06     The NBH plays a minor but pivotal role in direct investment financing.
Practically all of its total investment credits have been made to the produc-
tive sector. In 1979, NBH credits to the productive sector reached a peak
amount of Ft 24.4 billion (US$685 million) but fell to Ft 21 billion (US$575
1/ The productive sector includes industry, construction, agriculture and
forestry, transport and communications, trade, and water supply.



- 13 -
million) in 1982. NBH's credits in 1982 amounted to 14% of total investment
in the productive sector and 22% in the manufacturing sector. However, NBH
credits do constitute a substantial portion of total investment in certain
economic activities wheve its funds and its preferential credit lines (paras
3.13 to 3.17) are used to promote development in selected sectors and to com-
plement the enterprise resources.  Since 1979, the distribution of NBH credits
among sectors has changed substantially, with a declining emphasis on large
engineering investments and increased funding for chemicals and agriculture.
NBH credits presently finance about 30% of all investments in engineering,
light industry, building materials, and chemicals, and nearly 20% of agricul-
tural investments. NBH long term investment portfolio in the manufacturing
sector was Ft 79.6 billion (US$2 billion), by end of 1982.
Credit Policies and Guidelines
3.07     Since the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism, and particularly
since 1979, credit policies have become an increasingly important instrument
for determining the level and direction of investment expenditures. Although
the enterprises are making increased use of their self-generated and retained
resources for new investments, their continuing need for bank credits and for
foreign exchange resources to finance their investments has provided the autho-
rities with mechanisms to channel investments in pre-determined directions.
This has been done through the establishment of a number of preferential redit
schemes including those for promotion of exports, rationalization of evergy and
raw materials use, and promotion of research and development.
3.08     Interest rates are in active review in Hungary and quick adjustments
are being made. Interest rates on NBH investment credits have been steadily
increased, from 9% by January 1, 1981 to 12-14% in 1983. Real interest rates
on credit to enterprises (deflated by inflation rates of 7.5-8% in 1982-1983)
were about 4-6.5% in real terms in 1983. These interest rates apply irrespec-
tive of the maturity of credits. Maximum maturities on credits are twelve
years, although most credits are repaid in much shorter periods of time. Inte-
rest rates on medium-term credits for working capital have also been raised by
steps from 10-11% on January 1, 1981 to 15% in 1983. The structure of interest
rates is summarized in the table below. All these interest rates have been
positive - in the range of 4-7% - in real terms through 1983, and should remain
positive in view of projected inflation (8% in 1984 down to 7% in 1986).

3.09     Tn credit policies, besides the rapid upward adjustment of interest
rates, there has also been a policy of graduating enterprises towards harder
financing sources, that is from state grants to state loans and to NBH credits.
State grants have effectively disappeared for some sectors and have been only
partially replaced by interest-bearing and repayable state loans. In the
productive sectors, the state provides major amounts of investment finance for
only heavy industry, in particular mining, electric energy and metallurgy.
The NBH conditions for credit allocations have been considerably tightened in
response to rising demand and increased competition among enterprises.
3.10     The NBH Credit Policy Guidelines provide a framework for financing of
both new investment and working capital. Eligibility criteria for credits
include profitability (normally a profitability of at least 15% on industrial
fixed assets and permanent working capital), financial status and resources of
the borrower, project payback period, and adherence of the investment to
stated national economic objectives. The guidelines are revised annually.
3.11     Conditions for credit vary according to major sectors and those for
manufacturing investments are most stringent. Lower interest rates and
profitability requirements are allowed for the food and building materials
industries, mining, production of basic chemicals and raw materials for light
industry as well as for investments related to domestic trade, transport and
communications. The lowest interest rates and longest maturities are for
agriculture, forestry and water management investments 1/.
3.12     The Credit Guidelines have specified preferential investment areas
which have varied over the years. The 1979 Credit Guidelines referred to
seven preferential investment areas including labor-saving machinery, decen-
tralized regional industrial development, increases in construction industry
capacity and assistance to the central development program of the petro-
chemical industry. Only in 1980 was energy conservation added as a major
objective and a clear priority given to export promotion investment. rhe 1983
Credit Guidelines are now limited to five preferential investment areas -
export promotion, import substitution, energy conservation, material-saving/
recycling and technological innovation, and background industries serving
these purposes.  The government's program for the development of background
industries falls within the above preferential areas.
3.13     The Export Promotion Credit Line of the NBH has been in existence for
over ten years, and has its own specific allocation of funds from the bank' s
total credit resources. The appeal of this credit line needs to be seen
against the present tight credit conditions; this is a high-priority
preferential line of credit. Under this line, the NBH provides credits to
creditworthy enterprises which meet the general eligibility criteria (para.
3.10) and are moreover capable of (a) exporting 70-80% of incremental
production, and (b) having foreign exchange pay-back period of less than four
1/ Profitability requirements are a minimum 9% for investments in agriculture
and water supplies, and 11% for investments in construction materials,
food industry, basic chemicals, mining, trade, transport and telecomnuni-
cations.

years 1/.  If these conditions are met and pre-determined export targets are
achieved each year, the borrower receives financial incentives; these incen-
tives, formerly in the form of interest refund of 45% of interest costs, have
taken the form of profit tax refunds since January 1, 1984. Therefore the ex
post cost of such credits for an enterprise which met the above conditions aid
its export targets will increase from 8% in 1983 to the NBH's standaTd lending
rate of 14% in 1984.
3.14     Export promotion credits now account for about one-half of lending by
the NBH and are targeted to reach 60% of the total over the current Sixth
Five-Year Plan.  From 1976 to 1982, the NBH provided loans of Ft 74 billion
(about US$2 billion) for 2,800 export promotion projects, of which about 700
industrial projects (Annex 6). Of the Ft 64 billion (US$1.73 billion) dis-
bursed during the 1976-81 period, 40% were to agriculture and 60% to indus-
trial investments.  All the large-scale investments to date have been in
manufacturing industry (including food processing).  Among thc major invest-
ments financed from this credit line were the reconstruction and extension of
factories producing fluorescent fixtures, buses, meat products, sunflover oil,
corn syrup, pharmaceuticals, aluminum foil, electrode tubes, leather, textiles
and clothing. The overall results and performances of the export-oriented
projects financed by NiBH have been satisfactory:  convertible currency exports
of manufactures from projects financed by this credit faciLity increased from
$383 million in 1978 to $790 million in 1981 (Annex 7), representing an
increasing share of Hungary's total manufactured exports in convertible
currencies (from 20 to 28%). M4oreover, the export achievements exceeded until
1979 by 8% the export targets which had been projected in the credit apprai-
sals; in L980 and 1981 when Hungarian exports met difficult conditions on the
foreign markets, export achievements were below targets by 7% and 16%
respectively.
3.15     The demand for export promotion credits by creditworthy enterprises
with projects that can meet the credit guidelines criteria far exceeds the
supply of funds available to the NBR. In 1981, the total demand for export
promotion credits was Ft 33 billion (US$0.96 billion) against a credit allo-
cation of only Ft 10.4 billion (US$3 0 million).  The allocation was increased
to Ft 11.3 billion (US$308 million) in 1982. However, only an estimated
Ft 8.1 billion (US$193 million) are available for export promotion credits in
1983 due to the overall shortage of financial resources.  this allocation is
substantially below the average volume of credits granted annually in previous
years, and makes doubtful the achievement of the Ft 78 billion (about US$2
billion) target set for the Export Promotion Credit Line in the Sixtn Five-
Year Plan unless NBH receives additional resources for this credit facility.
1/  Net foreign exchange is computed for a year of full operation as gross
foreign exchange earnings less all costs incurred for depreciation of
imported goods, machinery and equipment, total energy costs as well as the
export value of tradeable raw materials and other inputs used in the
production of the exported commodity. The payback period is computed by
NBH as the ratio of the total project cost to the net foreign exchange
earnings in full project operation. This payback period is allowed to
reach four years, except in the case of livestock for meat production
where it is five years.



.. 16 -
3.16     In order to implement the Government program for material-saviug (see
Appendix II), NBJ- created high priority credit lines in 1982.  The demand for
credit for the material savings program is estimated at Ft 1.0-1.5 biLlion p.a.
(US$25-38 million) as compared to current credit allocations of Ft 500 million
,.a. (US$12.5 million) for this purpose.  The credit regulations issued in
October 1982 for aaterial-saving projects stipulate the following terms of
these credits:  repayment over up t. 10 years, an interest rate of 14% p.a.,
(the former interest refund of 257 repayable ex-post upon meeting project
objectives was abolished by January 1, 1984), and project's marginal profita-
bility ratio of at least 15% on fixed assets. The regulations also indicate
that priority will be given to small and quick repaying projects and to pro-
jects promoted jointly by material producing and consuming enterprises. lhe
material and waste recycling credit facility established by NiBH in January
1982, pursues basic objectives similar to the material-saving program.
Projects eligible for this credit facility are essentially plants for the
collection, conditioning and processing of material wastes suitable for
further use in industrial production. The terms and conditions of the credits
are similar to those of the material-saving credit facility; the forEmer
ex-post interest refund was also 25%. The demand fox credit is estimated at
Ft 1.2 billion p.a. ($30 million), as compared to current credit allocations
of about Pt 500 million per year.  Both the above schemes have become
operational in 1983.
3.17     The NBII has also established an Energy Raticnalization Facility since
early 1981 to support prinarily small investments in agriculture and industry.
About 600 small projects, with a total cost of about Fts 11 billion (US$315
million), have so far received assistance from the facility.  Another Fts 4
billion (about VS$100 million) have been allocated to this facility for the
remaining two years of the present 5-year plan period ending in 1985. The
terms and conditions of this program are similar to those of the export promo-
tion credit line.  The Bank's Industrial Energy Diversification and Conserva-
tion Project (Loan No. 2317-HU) will provide, in particular, assistance of
about US$29 million to this credit facility of the N4BH.
The 1liational l3ank of Hiun~gary (1VBi-)
3.18     The NBH will be the borrower of the proposed Bank loan.  A detailed
appraisal of NBH's institutional, operational and financial aspects is given
in Appendix III.  NBH{ has its head office in Budapest, with 19 regional
offices and 64 branches throughout Hungary.  The head office appraises all
projects with investment loans of above $2.5 million equivalent and export
oriented projects with loans of above $800,000 equivalent.  All other invest-
mtent loans and all working capital loans are processed at the branch level.
the branches are also responsible for the project supervision. NBH has a
total staff of about 6,400 persons, of which 2,760 are at the Head Office.
NB1{'s investment decisions had been largely based on feasibility reports and
related information furnished by borrowing enterprises, and reviewed by the
concerned government departments and the trading companies responsible for
marketing of products.  Its own staff had performed a limited evaluation of
projects--primarily of a financial nature--ensuring that the projects meet the
eligibility criteria. During the preparation and appraisal of the proposed



- 17 -
Project, the NBH has adjusted and upgraded the scope and depth of its project
evaluation close to Bank standards for DFCs, and its evaluation reports
submitted to the Bank for Bank-financed subprojects are comprehensive and
satisfactory (para. 4.19). The superviuion of projects is mainly of a
financial nature and project monitoring generally covers compliance with loan
conditions.
3.19     NBH's approach and procedures for project appraisal and supervision
would improve to intensify its development bankinLt role.  In particular, NBH
would have greater involvement in the determination of technical and marketing
viability of projects, and a broader supervision role in their implementation
and operation. This need is supported by the results of an ex-post evaluation
by NBHi of its export credits extended in 1976-1980 1/.  The results indicate
that half of the projects financed in industry had implementation deLays
averaging 6 months, and that a few projects had cost overruns or selected
inappropriate equipment; it also indicates that in a few cases the
achievements in terms of net foreign exchange gains and export profitability
fell short of project targets, due to lower demand or prices, impLementation
delays and slow start-up, or need for unforeseen imports of materials and
components.
3.20     NBH's overall financial position has been satisfactory.  It had an

The decrease in profit down to Ft 7.5 billion (US$205 milLion) in 1982 was due
to a significant increase in interest expenses on debt incurred during
Hungary's financial difficulties 1/ without a corresponding increase in
interest income. The increases in lending interest rates edicted in 1982 and
1983 will restore NBH's profitability to its previous levels. However, the
increase in NBH's profit is not an objective of the Government, its sole
shareholder; all NBH profits (after reserves against losses) are transferred
to the Government.
3.21     The main sources of NBH funds are, besides foreign loans, the depo-
sits of the Government, state enterprises, the state insurance company and the
other Hungarian banks. Given the multifunctional nature of NBH, the cost of
resources used to finance its development banking activities cannot be sepa-
rated out from the average cost or VB}I resources. The average cost of NBH
funds and resources has increased regularly, from about 6.9% of average out-
standing debt in 1.979 to about 9.5% in 1982.
3.22     The short- and long-term loan portfolios of NBH have increased during
1978-1982 by 65% and 22% respectively, and reached respectively Ft L52.6
billion (US$4.2 billion) and Ft 388 billion (US$10.6 billion) by the end of
1982.  NBH's loan recovery position is highly satisfactory.  There were no
loan write-offs in 1978-82, and rescheduling of loan maturities was very amall
ranging between Ft 1.1 billion (US$31 million) for 9 cases and Ft 2.7 biLlion
(US$75 million) for 30 cases over the last four years.
3.23     NBH's creditworthiness can be considered fully satisfactory, in view
of its good overall financial position, its impressive record of loan reco-
very, its Government ownership and its role as a Central Bank, and its cLose
operational relationship with borrowing enterprises and the other banks.
I/ The average interest cost on convertible currency debt increased from 5.9X
in 1979 to 9.7% in 1980, 14% in 1981 and 12.8% in 1982.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Components
4.01     The basic purpose of the proposed project is to support the Govern-
ment's programs for industrial restructuring and export expansion, through the
development of more effic.i.ent and higher value-added industries able to export
directly a major share of output to convertible currency markets or to supply
efficiently the exporting enterprises. The second objective i.4 to further
strengthen the role, influence and autonomy of the borrower, the National Bank
of Hungary (NBH), in the process of investment evaluation and decision-making,
vis-a-vis the Governmental agencies and the industrial enterprises. More
specifically, the project's object.ves would be, in line with the Government
strategy, to assist Hungary to:
(i) diversify and expand exports in all except heavy industries;
(ii)  increase industry's efficiency and competitiveness through material-
saving and technology upgrading investments and the promotion of
"backgrounti" industries producing essential components; and
(iii) strengthen the capacity of NBH and other institutions for developing
subsectoral .evelopment strategies, identifying and appraising
projects, and supporting more effectively the Government's economic
refonms through adjusted investment and lending criteria.
4.02     The project would consist of a loan of US$110 million to the National
Bank of Hungary to finance the foreign exchange components of:
a.   a group of 15 identified and pre-appraised subprojects (credit
package of up to US$38.0 million);
b.   other identified or future subprojects meeting agreed eligibility
criteria and to be approved and financed by NBH during the period
1984-1986 (credit lines totalling US$71.0 million); and
C.   foreign expertise and advisory services required for carrying out
three subsectoral development strategy studies (para. 4.20) and the
feasibility study of a possible future project (para. 4.21), and for
institutional strengthening of NBH (up to US$0.75 million).
The loan would also finance the capitalized front-end fee of about
US$275,000. Foreign exchange savings to be made under the US$38 million loan
allocation to the credit package would be reallocated to the credit lines.
4.03     Subprojects to be financed under the credit package and the credit
lines would be divided into:
(i) subprojects for expanding or supporting exports to convertible
currency markets, with a total allocation of US$73 million, including
the export subprojects of the credit package; and



- .O0 -
(ii)  subprojects for industrial restructuring (material-saving, technology
upgrading, background industries), with a total allocation of US$36
million, including thc restructuring subprojects of the credit
package.

4.04     The project costs for the credit package subprojects have been
estimated on the basis of detailed subproject data prepared by the subproject
entities and reviewed by the NBH and the Bank appraisal mission (para. 4,08).
The US$79.1 million total cost of the credit package compri.ses a base cost of
US$46.25 million for machinery and some construction (US$5.65 mill-ion), plus
US$6.85 million for working capital, US$10.1 million for contingencies (21% of
base cost) and US$15.9 million for duties and taxes and interest during con-
struction. The US$38 million total foreign exchange cost of the credit
package includes a base cost of US$28.0 million for imported machinery, plus
US$4.6 million for imported working capital (spare parts and components) and
US$5.4 million for contingencies (20% of foreign exchange base cost). Contin-
gencies on the foreign exchange cost include a small physical contingency of
5% (lists of machineries are well established) and a price contingency of 15%
based on projected foreign inflation of 7.5% and 7% in 1984 and 1985 respec-
tively; contingencies on local costs include a price contingency of 16%
(projected domestic inflation of 8% and 7.5% in 1984 and 1985 respectively)
and a physical contingency of 10% (this higher level being due largely to the
construction elemeat). The project costs for the credit lines subprojects
have been calculated on the basis of NBH's current pipeline of 28 projects for
industrial export and/or restructuring purposes, with a total cost of US$188
million equivalent including a direct foreign exchange cost of US$74 million
(para. 4.16). Moreover, it is estimated that the indirect foreign exchange
costs incorporated into the coustruction costs and supplies of local machinery
represent &ome 9.5% and 7.2% of the base and total project costs respectively,
i.e. the equivalent of US$18.5 million.
Eligibility Criteria
4.05     All the subprojects to be financed by the Bank loan under either the
credit package or the credit lines would have first to be acceptable to, and
approved by, NBH; they would also meet other general eligibility criteria
which were confirmed with the NBH during negotiations and were recorded in the
Loan Agreement, as follows.
a.   the subprojects should be undertaken by enterprises of the industrial
sector including the food industries, but excluding certain heavy
industries (mining, electric power, metallurgy and basic chemicals)
and agro-industries producing food in a primary or unprocessed form;
b.   the projects' entities should have a projected satisfactory financial
situation permitting them to contribute at least 25% to the project
cost from internal cash generation and/or equity increaaes and to
keep a debt service coverage ratio above 1.5 and a debr/equity ratio
below 2:1; and
c.   the subprojects should have a minimum FRR and ERR of 12% in real
terms.
4.06     The subprojects would also meet additional criteria specific to the
two project target groups (exports, restructuring). Every export subproject
would meet the following specific criteria, which were confirmed during
negotiations:



- 22 -
as   direct exports to, and/or sales to direct exporters for, convertible
currency markets should represent at least 60% of the subproject's
expected output; and
b.   the cumtilative net convertible currency earnings (before capital
depreciation) generated by the project during its first four years of
operation should exceed the convertible currency component of the
project's investment cost.
The-ce two criteria for export subprojects, which were agreed upon with NBH and
were confirmed during negotiations, are different from NBH's own eligibility
criteria for its export-generation credit facility (para. 3.13). The latter
criteria have been interprel:ed at times by NBH to allow in fact for import-
eaubstitution projects to be financed under the export credit facility.
These criteria were adjusted as described above to ensure that import-
substitution projects, or projects with remote or loose linkages with exports,
would not be financed under the Bank loan. Moreover, the adjustment to 60% of
the share of convertible currency exports in the projects' output (as compared
to the 70-80% share required in principle under NBII's official criteria) would
permit the financing of projects with '. high return which would contribute
largely to the balance of payments improvement.
4.07     Criteria were worked out and agreed upon with NBH during project
appraisal, with the purpose to define material-savings investments and back-
ground industries more clearly than NBH's own criteria (para. 3.16). With
respect to background industrien, NBH and the Government were not yet prepared
to earmark Bank funds onlv for the small and medium-size specialized and
independent firms which are expected to constitute in future the core of back-
ground industries; this was due to pending institutional and legal obstacles
which will be removed progressively in the coming years. Given the need and
importance to develop background industries activities for the restructuring
of the industrial sector, a wider crite.rion was worked out for background
industries investments. These should be designed to meet the needs of several
industrial customers for parts and components and would be undertaken by firnms
with knowledge and experience in the production of products similar to the
investments' production. This would avoid that Bank funds be used ma<.;ly by
large and non specialized firms or trusts for meeting their own need6.
Therefore, the subprojects to be financed under the industrial-restructuring
components of the Bank loan would meet, in addition to the gen-ral eligibility
criteria, the following specific criteria which were confirmed during
negotiations:
a.   investments made for material-savings and technology upgrading
purposes should generate a reduction of at leest 10% in the total
cost of raw materials and other intermediate consumption of the
product line concerned; and/or
b.   investments made for "background industries" should produce parts,
components or sub-assemblies using new technologies and for sale to
several enterprises to replace current or projected imports, and
should be undertaken by entities specialized in similar production
lines.

B. The Credit Package
4.08     The appraisal mission of May 1983 reviewed and pre-appraised, with
the assistance of specialized consultants, some 23 suibprojects proposed by NBH
for Bank financing, of which 14 for export-generation. All these subprojects
are for extensior, rehabilitation, modernization or technological upgrading of
parts/plants of existing companies. The mission withheld its approval for 8
of the proposed subprojects. The mission considered that 3 subprojects could
not be considered for the credit package (one in textiles, one for the produc-
tion of an agricultural biological ingredient, and one for electro-mechanical
gear), in view of their low or uncertain market prospects or the lack of
demonstrated competitiveness. The mission deferred its decision on the five
other subprojects, in view of the ueed to improve project preparation and
appraisal or to study other alternatives for the projects' design; these sub-
projects include two pharmaceutical projects for exports, one for agricultural
maW.hinery for exports, and two corrugated cardboard projects for restructuring
and indirect exports. These five subprojects are being further studied and
appraised by NBH and the corresponding enterprises, taking into account the
remarks of the Bank appraisal mission for improvements or rationalization in
their design and organization; thev would be approved by the Bank and financed
under the credit lines when and if satisfactorily appraised 1/.
4.09     The other 15 subprojects were further analyzed and assessed on the
basis of the consultants' individual reports and of additional information
provided by the NBH and the projects' sponsors. Financial and economic rates
of return were computed according to the Bank methodology; in the economic
analysis, border prices were used for all items of significance, and shadow
prices for labor and secondary energy supplies 2/. All these subprojects were
finally approved by the Bank during negotiations when NBH submitted full
appraisal reports satisfactory to the Bank which address the issues and
questions raised by the mission at the pre-appraisal stage.
4.10     The 15 subprojects of the Credit Package would have a total cost
estimated at Ft 3,324 million (US$79.1 million) with a direct foreign exchange
cost of up to US$38 million to be financed under the proposed Bank loan.
Savings made under this US$38 million component would be reallocated to the
credit lines for the same purposes. These 15 subprojects comprise two groups:
(a) 7 export-generation subprojects, including two for textiles, two for
pharmaceuticals, one for food products (salami), one for wood
products (chipboards), and one for engineering industries (electrical
gear); and
1/ The two corrugated cardboard projects were also pre-appraised with the
assistance of the Bank and specialized consultants in view of their
complexity, and were found economically and technically viable.
2/ An accounting ratio (between the shadow price and the financial price) of
1.25 was taken for labor. For secondary energy supplies (industrial steam
nainly, and electric power in a few instances), the financial costs were
corrected using a conservative accounting ratio ranging between 1.65 and
2.0 (the upper limit reflecting prices of steam).  Prices of primary
energy supplies were not adjusted, as the pricing policies followed for
such raw materials (para. 2.11) have enisured adjustment of their prices to
economic costs.



- 24 -
(b) 8 restructuring subprojects, including three subprojects for material-
saving purposes primarily (cellulose pulp, plastic products, and
electro-mechanicals), and five subprojects for technology upgrading
to produce modern background components (plastic products and
mechanical components).
4.11     All these subprojects will be undertaken by existing enterprises.  A
detailed description and analysis of the enterprises and the subprojects are
given in Appendix IV, and their major quantitative characteristics are
summarized in Annexes 8 to 10. The financial situation of the enterprises
undertaking these projects is quite satisfactory by Bank standards, on an
individual as well as on an aggregate basis. Current assets represent, on an
aggregate basis, half of total assets reflecting very large inventories usual
in shortage economies; equity funds represent about 60% of total liabilities,
and long-term debt about 21%, leading on average to a long-term debt/equity
ratio of 0.3:1 (ranging between 0 and 0.6) and a current ratio of 2.6. The
aggregate income statements indicate that materials and energy costs represent
on average 61% of output value, labor 7%, depreciation 3%, financial charges
2%, and administration/overheads 13%, leaving on average a gross profit margin
of 9% (ranging between 6.2% and 27.4%). Profits after tax, representing on
average 3.6% of sales (ranging between 2.4% and 10.5%) are allocated in
majority (two thirds) to the development fund for investment financing and
debt service, and most of the balance to the reserves of the enterprises. The
high management of enterprises is appointed by the Government (Ministry of
Industry generally), and is most generally motivated by the expansion drive
traditionally prevailing in socialist economies; it has a large aionomy in
Lhe operational and investment decisions. Access to credit for investment
financing is the foremost binding constraint on the investment decisions.
4.12     First credit applications sent initially by the enterprises to NBH
indicated that only 2 enterprises had intended to finance at least 25% of
their subproject costs from their own funds. As a result of the appraisal
mission's discussions with NBH and the subprojects' enterprises regarding the
subproject eligibility criteria and the enterprises' financial situation, the
other 13 sub-borrowers under the Credit Package have recently arranged to
raise the self-financing share of their project costs to 25%, generally by
postponing other investments of lower priority. A commitment from NBH was
confirmed in the Lear Agreement that it will ensure under its subloan contracts
a minimum contribution of 25% from the sub-borrowers under the credit lines.
4.13     Export-oriented subprojects would have minimum financial and economic
returns 1/ ranging between 15-34% and 17-27% respectively, which are satis-
factory. The project-generated profits before tax would yield returns on
fixed assets ranging between 17 and 37%, and total convertible currency
exports would amount to US$33 million p.a. after 2 to 3 years of operation, to
be generated by investments totalling US$39.2 million, of which US$18 million
in convertible currencies. The subproject for the production of meat salami
was reviewed by Hungary's health authorities, and would meet the Government's
strict environmental regulations which are appropriate. The two pharmaceu-
tical subprojects were designed to meet WHO's Good Manufacturing Practices
1/ Minimum rates of return were computed undev the prudent assumptions used
for sensitivity analysis, whereby output value was reduced by 10-25% or
operating costs increased by 10-25%.

4.14     Industrial restructuring subprojects would also have satisfactory or
high financial and economic returns, with minima ranging between 13-44% and
16-50% respectively; one project (pvc foil) has exceptionally high returns
(84-93%) due to its two t3treams of benefits (material-saving, and supply of
high-value product). Project-generated profits before tax would yield returns
on fixed assets ranging between 10 and 81%. The first two projects (elec-
trical contacts and straw pulp) consist mainly of material-saving investments,
with some capacity expansion; their material and other direct cost-savings
would represent between 20 and 27% of direct operating costs in the relevant
production lines. The paper plant where the straw pulp subproject would be
implemented has an effluent treatment plant which was reviewed by Hungary's



- 26 -
authorities and which meets the Government's strict environmental protection
regulations. The project for pvc foil production would produce a packing
material in high demand by food and other exporting industries, and would use
recycled pvc wastes resulting in material-savings equivalent to 24% of direct
operating costs. The specialized parts and components to be produced by the
five other background industries projects (drills, pvc pipes, pumps, elec-
trical accessories, hydraulic jacks) would be produced and sold at highly
competitive prices equal or below the CIF import prices 1/, thus generating
convertible currency import savings of about US$24.4 million per year. The
costs and benefits of these restructuring projects are described in Appendix
IV and Annex 10, and summarized below:

otherwise would not necessarily be met by imports. The benefits of the
other projects are savings of convertible currency imports presently
needed and which would be incurred by Hungary otherwise.

C. The Credit Lines
4.15     Two credit lines totalling US$71 million would be available to NBH to
finance respectively export expansion and industrial restructuring subprojects
which would be approved by NBS, and submitted to the Bank for review and
approval, during the period 1984-1986.  The credit line for export subprojects
would amount to US$55 million, so that the overall allocation of the Bank loan
to export subprojects totals US$73 million; the credit line for restructuring
subprojects would be allocated the remaining portion, i.e. US$16 million.  As
confirmed during negotiations, the subprojects to be financed under these
credit lines should meet the eligibility criteria described in paras. 4.05 to
4.07.  Evaluation of subprojects' e-! ironmental effects and safeguard measures
have been a standard feature of NBH _ appraisal reports; moreover, for credit
package subprojects requiring significant environment protection measures,
special notes have been prepared by the concerned authorities. As confirmed
during negotiations, NBH's appraisal reports for Bank-financed subprojects
will continue to include such features.
4.16     NBH has an important pipeline of potential subprojects under apprai-
sal or preparation. This pipeline, which covers most of 1984 and part of
1985, presently includes 28 projects (including the 5 subprojects for which
Bank decision has been deferred pending improvements in project design - para.
4.08) with an estimated total cost of Ft 7,896 million (US$188 million), of
which Ft 3,116 million (US$74 million) for the direct foreign exchange costs
(see Annex 11). The export-expansion subprojects in the pipeline number 18,
with a tota' estimated cost of Ft 6,322 million (US$150.5 million) and a
direct foreign exchange cost of Ft 2,524 million (US$60 million). The 10
subprojects for restructuring (mostly for background industries) have a total
estimated cost of Ft 1,574 million (US$37.5 million) with a direct foreign
exchange cost of Ft 592 million (US$14.1 million). It is estimated, in view
of NBH's current pipeline and of the projected level of industrial investment
after 1983 (para. 2.17), that the total direct foreign exchange requirements
of all industrial export and restructuring projects to be financed by NBH
during the 1984-1986 period to be covered by the proposed project will total
about US$160 million including the credit package, or US$122 million excluding
the credit package. Tre credit lines of the proposed loan would finance 58%
of these foreign exchange requirements (excluding the credit package). The
42%o portion leaves room for a possible co-financing operation using the new
Bank instruments (see para. 4.33).
D. Institution-Strengthening_Com2onent
4.17     NBH has substantial experience in industrial financing and its per-
fotmance, measured by operational and loan recovery results, has been sound.
Its operational procedures are elaborate and well-defined, and staff engaged
in industrial sector operations perform theit responsibilities and functions
satisfactorily. NBH does not have its own technical staff for project apprai-
sal and supervision. Until 1981, it was depending largely upon the views of
the Ministry of Industry (MOI) on the technical viability of industrial pro-
jects; however, since mid-1982, MOI does not formally review the technical
evaluation of projects with a total cost telow Ft 500 millicn. Regarding the



- 28 -
marketing viability of projects, NBH used to rely substantially on the views
and assurances of the trading companies responsible for marketing of products
manufactured and/or to be manufactured by beneficiary enterprises. NBH's pro-
ject supervision systen has been consisting basically of a financial follow-up
of its borrowers, without the regular project monitoring system which may help
to identify problens during early stages and to initiate remedial measures,
particularly in technical areas.
4.18     NBII's approach and procedures for project work needed reorientation
to enable nore comprehensive project appraisal and supervision and, thus, to
deepen the development banking role of NBHl (paras 8-13 of Appendix III).  In
order to achieve this, the following understandings were reached between NBH
and the appraisal mission and formally confirmed during loan negotiations, and
recorded in the Loan Agreement, that for all Bank-financed subprojects:
(a)  NB1H will retain the services of three Hungarian technical insti-
tutions to assist NBH staff in the rechnical appraisal and super-
vision of subprojects. These institutes, VEGYTERV (Chemical
Industries Engineering Center), GEPIPARI TECHNOLOGIAI INTEZET
(Technical Institute for Machinery) and KONNYUIPARI TERVEZO
VALLALAT (Light Industries Engineering Center), are acceptable to
the Bank; managers of NBH's credit departments are in a position
to assess and guide the work of these institutions. The terms of
reference for these institutions' assistance to NBH, which were
finalized and agreed during loan negotiations, are given in Annex
12.  The appointment of these institutions should be completed
before loan effective- ness.
(b)  1NBH should receive from enterprises/trading companies all the
data and infornation relevant to domestic or foreign demand,
supply, production, imports, exports, prices, etc., in order to
review and to make an independent assessment of the narket
viability of projects both in Hungary and abroad. As NBH does
not have such expextise, it will retain the services of the
Institute for Economic and Market Research, Budapest (KOPINT, an
institute well-versed in market research and studies both in
domestic and foreign markets, and acceptable to the Bank) as a
consultant to assist NBH in market evaluation of subprojects.
The terms of reference for the Institute's assistance to NBH,
which were also finalized and agreed during loan negotiations,
are given in Annex 13.  The appointment of the fnstitute should
be completed before loan effectiveness.
(c)  NBH will introduce the calculation of ERR and FRR and preparation
of financial projections (income statenents, and cash flow
statements) as a part of comprehensive economic and financial
appraisal of subprojects and of the benefici'--y enterprises.
Scope and content of NBH's appraisal reports were agreed upon.



- 29 -
(d)  NBH would prepare by October 31, 1984 a draft operationaL mana.ual
designed to firm up, coordinate and improve its existing proce-
dures for more comprehensive project appraisal arid supervision.
The manual will be finalized after receiving the Bank's comments,
and its procedures officially applied to all Bank-financed sub-
projects before January 31, 1985.
(e)  Procedures mentioned in (a) to (d) above i;l  be initially
applied to the industrial subprojects to be financed by NBH under
the proposed loan.  The experience thus gained wilL be reviewed
in detail by N3H, in consultation with the Bank, before June 3a0,
1986.  The review will exaTnine, inter alia, hlow and to what
extent this experience can be extended to all other industrial
project s financed by NBH.  This cormmitment was recorded in the
Loan Agreement.
4.19     The NBH has already taken significant intennediate steps towards
deepening its development banking role as described above. Firstly, NBJi staff
participated actively to the project preparation and in particular to the pre-
appraisal analyses carried out by the Bank for the credit package subprojects.
This, combined with occasional guidance from the Bank, aLlowed SBlH to prepare,
and submit to the Bank during negotiations, satisfactory appraisal reports for
the 15 credit package subprojects, as well as to already upgrade suLbstantially
the appraisal practices it will use for the subprojects to be financed under
the loan. Secondly, in order to facilitate and assist NBH's work in its next
steps and particularly in firming up its appraisal and report preparation of
the subprojects to be financed under the credit lines, the foLlowing undex-
standings were reached between NBR and the Bank during negotiations and
recorded in the Loan Agreement:
(a)  NBH will use the services of a general expert in project appraisal
and supervision in order to assist it in: (i) preparing and
finalizing the appraisal and reports of the first five subprojects
to be submitted to the Bank for its approval under the credit
lines; (ii) strengthening NBH's project supervision procedures;
(iiti Dreparing the draft opeTrational manual for project appraisal
and supervision; and (iv) guiding and training NB[ staff in these
matters. NBH firnly intends to use the services of this expert in
March or April 1984 for a period of about 3 months, to be extended
if needed.  The terms of reference of this expert, given in AnneK
14, were agreed upon during negotiations;
(b)  NBH would also have the resources to use the services of spe-
cialized experts in technical and market matters, whenever it sees
it needed to complement the capacities of the Hungariant technical
and market institutes (para. 4.18 (a) and (b)) for specific spe-
cialized tasks to be carried aut in the appraisal of subprojects
to be financed Linder the credit lines; and



- 30 -
(c)  NWBH will send during project implementation 3-4 professional staff
for advanced training in foreign institutes and on a study tour of
selected industrial development banks for about 6 months to
strengthen their practical knowledge of techniques and procedures
for project appraisal and supervision.
To support NBH in these undertakings, the institutional-strengthening corn-
ponent of the proposed loan includes up to US$100,000 to cover the foreign
exchange costs (including fees, travel and subsistence) of foreign expertise
to be hired for items (a) and (b) above for an estimated total amount of up to
10 man-months.  These experts would be selected and recruited by NBH in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants.  Given that
NBH intends to use the services of at least one-expert (item (a) above) in the
next months, retroactive financing under the Bank loan would be needed to
finance such services (para. 4.27). Finally, an allocation of up to US$75,000
is made under the proposed loan to finance the foreign exchange costs of the
NBH staff training program (item (c) above).
E. Subsector and Project Preparation Studies
4.20     In order to assess the export potential and comparative advantage of
selected industrial activities and to identify the major constraints hampering
exports and how these might be alleviated, the Bank and the Hungarian autho-
rities agreed that three subsector studies would be undertaken during the pro-
ject implementation. These studies would work out subsectoral development
strategies for product groups with a comparative advantage for exports (to be
established or confirmed by the studies) and make recommendations for measures
and subsector policies designed to promote exports. Within the framework of
the general dialogue pursued between Hungary and the Bank on economic and
sector work, the Bank and the Hungarian authorities have agreed to seLect the
following subsectors for these studies which would be carried out under the
aegis of the Ministry of Industry by appropriate specialized Hungarian
institutions as follows:
-    Pharmaceutical industries, by the VEGYTERV Institute;
-    Foundry and Forging, by the GEPIPARI TECENOLOGIAI INTEZET; and
-    Agricultural Machinery, by the MEZOGEP Trust (the coordinating body
for the 14 enterprises producing agricultural machinery in Hungary).
Draft terms of reference of these studies were discussed by the Bank and the
Governeient (Annex 15); they will be finalized shortly, and before November 30,
1984, through further discussions with the Bank. The Hungarian authorities
indicated that the designated institutions have already started (pharmaceuti-
cals), or will start soon, carrying out these studies, and would need to
complerent their teams with foreign expertise and advice for the parts of the
studies dealing with international comparisons and markets, for an estimated
total of up to 45 man-months. The proposed loan includes up to US$450,000 to
cover the foreign exchange costs of such foreign expertise (including fees,
travel and subsistence); NBH would onlend these funds, administer the



- 31 -
disbursements, and remain responsible for reimbursement of these funds. The
scope and amount of foreign expertise will be established on a pragmatic basis
after the carrying-out of the studies' initial phases allow the authorities
and the designated institutions to identify precisely their needs for foreign
advice; it was agreed therefore that the terms of reference of the foreign
consultants will be prepared and agreed upon at a later stage and before
November 30, 1984. The studies would be completed by March 31, 1985, and
would be reviewed and discussed with the Bank; these arrangements were
confirmed during negotiations and recorded in the Guarantee Agreement.
4.21     Finally, the Hungarian authorities have requested Bank assistance and
cooperation in carrying out the feasibility study for a large chemical project
for the fabrication of methyl diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), a chemical base
material for the manufacture of polyurethane foam which is used as an
efficient insulation medium in industry and construction, as well as for
upholstery and other purposes in the furniture and automobile industries.
This project, which if justified by the feasibility study will likely forn a
component of a future Bank project, would have a capacity of 25,000 tpy using
imported technology and production processes; the project would cost some
US$30 to 35 million, with a foreign exchange content of up to 707., depending
on the process and licenses selected. The project's enterprise (BVg) masters
the delicaLe technology required for the production of this product and most
raw materials required would be available at the plant's site, giving the
project a good comparative advantage in Europe in view of the difficulty to
transport some of the raw materials. Detailed world market studies indicate
that MDI will most likely be in short supply, particularly in Europe, by the
mid-1980s and that Hungary has excellent prospects for exporting 75% of its
output to convertible currency markets.
4.22     The Hungarian project sponsors, in particular the Ministry of
Industry, intend to proceed quickly in order to establish a firm position in
the export markets, and to use Bank methodology in the selection of alter-
native processes and in assessing market potential. Local consultants
(VEGYTERV) have been appointed by Hungarian authorities to carry out a pre-
feasibility study for the project which was completed in January 1984, and
about 10 man-months of foreign consultants will be required to review the
pre-feasibility study, update it and expand it as necessary into a full
feasibility report, in particular with respect to the assessment of export
markets and selection of processes.  Total costs for the project feasibility
studies are estimated at US$200,000 equivalent, of which up to UStl00,000
would be in foreign exchange.  In view of the promising export prospects and
the relative importance of this project in the future investment program for
chemical industries, Bank financing of the feasibility study is justified.
The proposed loan includes up to US$100,000 to finance the foreign exchange
costs of the study (including fees, travel and subsistence); NBH will onLend
the funds, administer the disbursements, and remain responsibli for
reimbursement of these funds. Foreign consultants will be selected and
employed according to Bank guidelines; their terms of reference were prepared
and agreed upon by the Bank and the Government (Annex 16).

F. Project Implementation
4.23     Interest Rates and Foreign Exchange Risk.  As agreed during negotia-
tions, th, proposed loan will be onlent by NBH to beneficiary enterprises at
NBH's standard interest rate for long-term lending, which has been 14% p.a,
since all existing interest refunds on priority credit lines (paras. 3.13 and
3.15) were abolished under NBH's new Credit Guidelines effective January 1,
1984. Loans from NBH's own sources will carry the same interest rate. It was
also agreed during negotiations that the onlending interest rate for Bank
funds should remain at least equal to the Bank's lending rate plus a margin of
30% of said rate. The substantial margin of at least 3 percentage points to
be earned by NBH on Bank loan proceeds will allow NBH to cover its administra-
tive costs and assume the foreign exchange and interest risks on the Bank
loan. These agreements were recorded in the Loan Agreement. Moreover, the
onlending rates will be above the projected domestic inflation rates of 8% in
1984, 7.5% in 1985 and 7% in 1986.
4.24     Loan Repayment.  The loan will be repaid to the Bank over 15 years,
including a grace period of three years, under a fixed amortization schedule.
The repayment terms between NBH and beneficiary enterprises will be consistent
with NBH's present policy which provides for the maximum maturity period of
investment loans at 12 years from the start of operations or the economic life
of investment, whichever is lower. Subloans will be repaid over a maximum
period of 12 years, and it is estimated that normal subloan repayment periods
will range between 5-10 years including the grace period. Sub-borrower
repayments surplus over the Bank loan repayment requ:.cements of NBH would be
utilized exclusively by NBH to finance capital investments for industrial
export and restructuring projects in Hungary.
4.25     Sub-project and Sub-loan Limits.  As agreed during negotiations, the
maximum subproject and subloan sizes under the credit lines will normally be
$20 million and $10 million respectively; the Bank may approve larger subloans
in exceptional cases. These agreements were recorded in the Loan Agreement.
These limits are somewhat below the average sf.ze of an industrial project in
Hungary. Nevertheless, NBH would still be able to finance projects with an
economic size. On the basis of NBH's project pipeline, it is estimated that
most of the subprojects (over 90%) will have a subloan size of less than $5
million.
4.26     Free Limit.  NBH is a very large financial institution with substan-
tial experience in investment credit to the industrial sector, and the pre-
appraisal of 23 subprojects by the appraisal mission in coordination with
NBH's staff has provided the latter with useful exposure in this respect and
with the opportunity to upgrade substantially the standards of their appraisal
reports (para. 4.19). Also, the proposed technical assistance aims to further
strengthen staff expertise in project appraisal.  However, this is the first
developrent-banking loan of the Bank for which NBH will be fully responsible,
and NBH intends to undertake some institution-strengthening (para. 4.17). It
was thus agreed during negotiations to set a free limit at US$1.0 million for
individual subloans, the first five subloans under the free limit being
reviewed by the Bank before its approval. These arrangements were recorded in



- 33 -
the Loan Agreement. It is estimated on the basis of NBH's pipeline that half
of the number of subloans 1/ under the credit lines will be above the free
limit, thus requiring the Bank's in-depth review and approval of each
subproject.
4.27     Retroactive-Financing.  A number of  Bank pre-appraised projects pro-
visionally approved under the credit package have not been in a position to
wait for loan signature before initiating the procurement procedures and in
some cases placing part of their orders for imported equipment. As indicated
in Annex 17, orders of up to $6.0 million will have to be contracted (after
Bank approval) for 11 subprojects of the credit package with expected delivery
before the end of March 1984. These orders would represent part of the
foreign exchange costs to be financed under the Bank loan for these 11 sub-
projects, which is about 5% of the total loan amount. For these reasons, and
taking also into account the possible need for partial retroactive financing
of the subsector studies and technical support to NBH and for other items, it
is proposed, as agreed upon during negotiations and recorded in the Loan
Agreement, that retroactive financing be allowed for an amount of up to $8.0
million.
4.28     Procurement and Disbursements.  Goods and services to be financed
from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be procured according to
Bank consultants and Procurement Guidelines.  Individual bidding packages
above US$1 million would be procured under international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. Other individual packages or orders
could be procured according to the procedure of "limited international
tendering" (l.i.t.). This procedure would be appropriate in view of the
diversity, number and small size of orders involved; in the cases where
high-technology machinery is to be procured, this procedure will be de facto
imposed by the small number of qualified suppliers.  L.i.t. procurement should
be based on the comparative evaluation of the bids from qualified potential
suppliers in at least 3 different countries. Given that the foreign exchange
costs of the subprojects under the credit package have been estimated on the
basis of lists of equipments and machinery which were assessed by NBH to be
imported, procurement for the credit package subprojects will be open to
foreign bidders only. Equipment and machinery for the credit lines
subprojects have been estimated to be generally not available in Hungary;
their procurement will be open to foreign and eventually local bidders, and it
is likely that most bidders will be foreign suppliers from countries eligible
under the Bank Guidelines. Local bidders would be granted the standard
preference equivalent to customs/import duties or 15% of CIF prices, whichever
is lower. These arrangements were reviewed and finalized during the loan
negotiations, and recorded in the Loan Agreement.
4.29     Bank's standard ex-ante review (from tender documents to contract
awards) will be confined to I.C.B. bid packages above US$3 million. For pro-
curement packages between US$300,000 and US$3 million, the Bank review will be
limited to bid evaluation reports and the approval of draft contract awards,
and a]l other standard documentation will be kept by NBH in its records for
Bank ex-post review and supervision. 'rhese arrangements were reviewed and
finalized during the negotiations, and recorded in the Loan Agreement.
I/ Representing in amount 85% of the credit lines.



- 34 -
4.30     Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against 100 percent of
the foreign expenditures for consul-ants' services and fellowships, and 100
percent of foreign expenditures for equipment and materials needed for the
credit package subprojects, and 103 percent of foreign expenditures and 100
percent of local expenditures (ex-factory) for equipment and materials noeded
for the credit lines subprojects. Disbursements would be made on the basis of
standard documentation. In order to expedite disbursements, a Revolving Fund
of US$5 million (equivalent to about 2-month disbursements in 1984) will be
opened by NBH by loan effectiveness; this fund will be replenished on the
basis of standard docuLnentation for eligible reimbursable expenditures.  The
closing date for disbursements would be December 31, 1989. The disbursement
schedule for the Credit Package subprojects was estimated on the basis of NBH
appraisal reports' forecasts; the disbursement schedule for the credit lines
was estimated on the basis of the standard disbursement profile for EMENA/IDF
loans with a six-month extension for contingencies (Annex 18). These arrange-
ments were finalized during the negotiation3, and recorded in the Loan
Agreement.
G. Reporting and Auditing
4.31     NBH would submit to the Bank summary quarterly, and detailed semi-
annual, progress reports on subprojects under implementation.  NBH would also
prepare a compLetion report on each subproject six months after its comple-
tion; such report will be kept ready for review by the Bank's supervision
missions. This would be in addition to an overall completion report on the
entire project to be prepared six months after the completion of disburse-
ments. Six-monthly operatioral reports will also be prepared by NBH staff and
provided to the Bank on completed subprojects during the first three years of
subprojects' operations, with a statement showing (i) performance of indivi-
dual subprojects against anticipated operational targets (production, exports,
material savings, etc.), (ii) reasons for shortfalls, if any, in meeting
targets, and (iii) actions being taken/proposed to be taken by NBH and/or
enterprises to improve performance. Thereafter, reports will be provided to
the Bank only on subprojects facing major problems, if any, in meeting their
operational targets. Agreement was reached during negotiations on these
reporting requirements.
4.32     NBH would furnish to the Bank within four months after the end of
each fiscal year the project account audited by independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank and according to the Bank guidelines.  The NBH would also
furnish to the Bank within 6 months after the e4d of each fiscal year its
audited financial statements.  Enterprises receiving subloans under the b3ank
loan would submit to NBH for the Bank's review during supervision missions,
within four months after the end of each fiscal year, (i) audit reports on
their overall annual financial results and position, and (ii) audited accounts
of subprojects which should permit assessment of the use of subproject funds.
NBH will ensure that the enterprises' audits are acceptable to the Bank. One
Hungarian company, the General Banking and Trust Company, has been assessed by
the Bank as an independent auditor qualified and acceptable for this purpose.
During negotiations assurances were obtained on the above auditing require-
ments, and were recorded in the Loan Agreement.

H.  Potential for Co-Financing
4.33     According to the project's financing plan which is confirmed with NBH
(para. 4.03), the credit line component of t:he proposed Loan would finarnce 58%
of NBH's convertibie currency direct requirements for all industrial export
and restructuring projects to be approved by NBH besides the credit package
during the period 1984-1986 to be covered by the loan; these requirements
would total about US$122 million (para. 4.16). Resource constraints in the
Bank and NBH have limited the size of the Bank Loan and of the project to be
financed by it. In coordination with NBH, co-financing using the B-Loan
instrument is being sought so that the scope of the credit lines component
could be extended to cover a larger share of NBH's 1984-1986 pipeline of
eligible subprojects. Since the Credit Package subprojects have already been
pre-appraised and for many implementation is about to start, any possible
B-Loan to be mobilized in future would be used to assist the financing of
subprojects under the credit lines component. Under these circumstances, the
total cost of all subprojects to be financed under the Loan could rise from
the current US$257 million to about US$340 million.  The cv-fi-.Lncing funds
would cover the additional direct and indirect foreign exchange costs, and
could also refinance the loans in local currency to be extended by NBH for the
Credit Package and the credit lines' subprojects 1/.
4.34     The Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) has been discussing with NBH and is
considering a possible participra.ion to the co-financing scheme for an amount
of about SDRs 5 million as long as Nordic interests can be ascertained. The
principle of NIB's participation will be confirmed after I.C.B. procurement
for the first Credit Package subprojects is completed and shows that goods
will be procured from nordic suppliers. In that case, nordic supplies would
be financed under the Bank loan and the NIB would be prepared tu disburse
equivalent amounts for refinancing of NBH's local currency loans.
I. Project Benefits and Risks
Benefits
4.35     The proposed loan is expected to yield major benefits to Hungary,
both quantitative and qualitative. Firstl7, the set of subprojects to be
financed out of the Bank loan would make a key contribution to Hungary's
objective of industrial structural adjustment; these subprojects, representing
about 9% oc total industrial investment (excluding mining and poxwer) over the
period 1984-1986, would constitute about 30% of the industrial structural
adjustment program 2/ during the next 3 years.  hnese investments, focusing on
export-generation, material-saving and technology upgrading of background
industries would yield substantial benefits to Hungary's balance of trade
position; the following table, based on the expected benefits of the credit
package subprojects and of the NBH pipeline subprojects, siunmarizes these
benefits:
1/  Excluding thus from co-financing the 25% self-financing share required
from the sub-borrowers.
2/ This program would essentially comprise NBH's total pipeline for export-
generation, energy-saving and material-saving, and background industries
plus the other energy-saving projects financed under the Bank loan for
Industrial Energy Diversification and Conservation.

The project would moreover constitute a sound vehicle for co-financing, thus
contributing further to the improvement of Hungary's balance of payments.
4.36     Equally important would be the non-quantifiable be3efits to be
derived from the institutional-support components. The ;roposed project aims
at strengthening the institutional capability of NBH to Linance projects and
enterprises viz:ble on open and foreign markets without subsidies or grants and
relying on hard financing sources. NBH's selection of bankable projects would
be improved through adjusted eligibility criteria reflecting more appro-
priately than before the objectives of NBH's priority credit facilities and
the achievements which can be expected realistically from the subprojects.
NBH's comprehensive appraisal based on an objective market review, thorough
technical and fiuiancial evaluation, and economic cost-benefit analysis would
normally result in sound investment decisions. The new extensive project
supervision system and reporting requirements would contribute to timely com-
pletion of projects and minimize cost overruns; moreover, it would help in
early identification of emerging problems and prompt action for their solu-
tion. The enhanced professional expertise already gained and to be gained by
NBH staff, through the technical assistance and appraisal and supervision of
sub-projects, would have an impact on the overall operations of NBH in the
industrial sector and would help to further improve their efficiency. The
first results achieved by NBH in the field of institutional-strengthening and
appraisal-upgrading during the preparation of the project (para. 4.19) are
promising.



- 37 -
4.37     On the policy side, the consideration by the enterprises in their
credit applications and by NBH in its project appraisals of border prices for
project output and inputs and of shadow prices for energy and labor in compu-
ting the economic rate of return of the subprojects will help to reinforce the
impact and pervasiveness of the economic reforms' objectives in the process of
investment decision-making, As already experienced for credit package subpro-
jects, the 25% self-financing requirements will further induce enterprises to
select carefully their investments and postpone projects of low priority
(para. 4.10). Moreover, :he abolition of interest refunds and their replace-
ment by profit tax refunes (para. 3.13) for export and other priority projects
constitute a substantial policy im.provement in the structure of export incen-
tives and factor prices. Finally, the three subsector studies would assist
the planning authorities in improving investment decisions and implementing
viable development policies and strategies.
Risks
4.38     The risks are essentially those attached to a new Bank borrower, in
particular those attached to the use of new concepts, approaches and opera-
tional procedures for procurement and disbursements. However, the high qua-
lity of NBH's staff and its achievements in the preparation of appraisal
reports for subprojects in the credit package are the best assurances that
these risks should remain low and minimal. Moreover, the Bank will pay all
the attention required and will assist the NBH through substantial monitoring
and supervision.

V.  RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     The proposed loan of US$110 million to the National Bank of Hungary
(NBH), comprising a credit package of US$38 million for 15 pre-appraised
projects, credit lines totalling US$7. million for industrial export and
restructuring subprojects, US$0.725 million for the foreign exchange costs
required for technical assistance to NBH and for subsector studies, and
US$0.275 million for the capitalized front-end fee, is suitable for Bank
financing. The final date for submission of subprojects to Bank refinancing
would be December 31, 1986 and the closing date would be December 31, 1989.
5.02     The following agreements were reached during negotiations and were
incorporated into the Loan Agreement and side letters with NBH, and in the
Guarantee Agreement with the Government:
Withi the Government on:
(a)  the carrying out of subsector studies for the development of
pharmaceutical, agricultural machinery, and foundry and forging
industries, with the assistance of consultants under Terms of
Reference to be finalized before November 30, 1984 (para. 4.20);
(b)  the joint ieview and discussion of the subsector studies upon their
completion before harch 31, 1985 (para. 4.20);
(c)  the carrying out of a feasibility study for the MDI chemical project
with consultants under agreed Terms of Reference (para. 4.22); and
With the NBH on:
(d) the general and specific eligibility criteria (paras. 4.05 to 4.07);
(e) the requirement of a minimum 25% contribution to subproject costs
from the companies under the credit package (para. 4.12);
(f) the Terms of Reference of institutions providing assistance to NBH in
technical and market appraisals of subprojects (para. 4.18);
(g) the preparation of a draft Operation Manual by October 31, 1984 and
the introduction of recommended procedures before January 31, 1985
(para. 4.18);
(h)  the joint review and discussion with the Bank of NBH's experience
with the new appraisal and supervision procedures, before June 30,
1986 (para. 4.18);
Ci) the onlending terms and interest rates (para. 4.23)i
(j) the maximum subproject and subloan sizes under the credit line
components (para. 4.25);



- 39 -
(k) the procurement and disbursement procedures (paras. 4.28 and 4.30);
(1) the reporting requirements (para. 4.31); and
(m) the auditing requirements (para. 4.32).
5.03     The appointment of institutions providing assistance to NBH in tech-
nical and market appraisal of subprojects (para. 4.18) will be a condition of
loan effectiveness.
5.04     Provided that satisfactory agreements are reached during negotiations
on the above, the Project is considered suitable for a Bank Loan of US$110
million at the Bank's variable interest rate for repayment over 15 years
including a grace period of 3 years. Retroactive financing of up to US$8
million (para. 4.27) and the establishment of a Revolving Fund of US$5 million
(para. 4.30) are recommended under the proposed loan.

FOUNDRY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
Draft Ternms of Reference
Objective
The paper should formulate a strategy for the development of the
foundry industry in Hungary addressing among others the Government's
objectives of reducing energy consumption, increasing material savings,
improving casting quality and rationalizing the foundry industry structure,
It should be based on a review and evaluation in this industry of exi6Ling
operations in llungary, an analysis of the Hungarian market for ferrous
castings and its export prospects, a review of the policy and institutional
framework and an assessment of the planned investments. The strategy should
be limited to foundries producing ferrous castings (iron and steel). The main
topics to be covered in the paper are summarized below:
A. Review and Evaluation of Existing Foundry Operations in Hungary
This section should be based on a detailed assessment of existing
foundries with a yearly production of 5,000 tons or more, and a global
assessment of the smaller foundries producing less than 5,000 tons per year.
The assessment should include:
(i)  background of overall Hungarian foundry industry, including for the
last 5 years, value of output, value added, employment, investment,
value of exports and share of these in Hungarian metallurgical and
engineering industries, and the overall industry sector;
(ii) review of the current foundry industry structure and recommendations
for restructuring if necessary;
(iii) capacity and utilization of capacity, with particular attention to
factors restricting optimal utilization;
(iv) classification of castings in different product groups and by
consuming industries (also marketing links with consuming industries);
(v) technology and production processes used and the present level of
research work in the foundry industry;
(vi)  production organization (layout, equipment, materi&il flow, production
planning and control) and needs for technical reorganization;
(vii)  quality of different castings produced and factors restricting
quality improvements;

(viii)  evaluation of operating performance, including engineering
capability, labor productivity and skills, unit consumption of raw
materials and consumables and their comparison with industrialized
countries, as well as recommendations for measures to raise
performance, increase material savings and reduce energy consumption;
(ix) analysis of operating costs (raw materials, consumables, taxes and
duties, labor, energy), comparison with industrialized countries and
recommendations to reduce costs;
(x) review of technical assistance arrangements, licensing arrangements,
technical linkages with consuming industries and proposals to improve
quality, productivity and research work in the foundry sector; and
(xi) evaluation of foundries management in financial and marketing aspects.
B.  Market for Ferrous Casting!
This section should, based on an analysis of historic and projected
demand for castings, determine the type of castings in which the Hungarian
foundry industry should concentrate to develop an export potential and meet
local demand. It should include;
(i) historic supply and consumption of castings in Hungary for the last
10 years:
- supply, domestic production, imports (direct and indirect)
and exports by type of castings
- consumption by type of castings and by main corsuming industries
(ii) future Hungarian demand in next 10 years;
- by consuming industries
- by type of castings
(iii) determination of product groups and this volumes for export and/or
further efficient import substitution.
C. Analysis of Policy and Institutional Framework
Review of policy and institutional framework in promoting the
Hungarian foundry industry and, if necessary, recommending measures to improve
their effectiveness. It should deal with the present institutional mechanism,
procedures and policies with respect to taxation, incentives, prices, tariffs,
etc. with a view to promote exports and efficient import substitution. It
should demonstrate institutional constraints in the development of the
industry. Further, it should analyze the present financing channels for this
industry and, if necessary, make proposals for improvements for the optimal
development of this industry.

D. Comparative Advantage of Hungarian Foundry Industry
This section should include an analysis of domestic resource cost and
effective protection rate of the foundry industry (if possible, by different
product groups) which should be supported by data from the firms in this
industry.  The main objective of this exercise is to establish types of
castings which Hungary should be able to produce in order to develop exports.
E. Strategy for Development of Hungarian Foundry Industry
Based on analysis under sections A to D:
(i)  identify main constraints that affect the foundry industry
particularly with respect to:
- reduction of energy
- increase of material savings
- improvement of quality
- structure
(ii) suggest measures (including policies/incentives) for further
development of the foundry industry including rehabilitation/
modernization of the existing foundries and possibly their
restructuring;
(iii)  recommend measures (including policies/incentives) to develop
exports, and supply downstream users and industries; and
(iv)  assess the present investment plans and propose an investment program
for implementing specific measures in the foundries reviewed and the
foundry industry in general with a view to achieve the above
objectives.

THE PRICING SYSrEM IN HUNGARY
The Price System in Hungary
1.       Before the 1968 reforms, prices were in general centrally determined
and did not usually reflect relative resource scarcities.  Produce- and
consumer prices were separated through a wide range of taxes and subsiditc
The 1968 reforms encouraged some move toward price detennination by the
enterprises. However, these moves were retarded in the mid-1970s, as the
ecornomy moved back toward a more centralized system, in an effort to
neutralize the impact of the sharp rise in world prices.
2.       A second major price reform was introduced on January 1, 1980 1/.
With the objective of a more rational use of inputs for production new methods
of price determination were instituted which stressed a closer link between
domestic and world market prices.
3.       Producer Prices are set according to two principles, namely prices
derived from imports, and those based on exports, as follows:
Import-based Price Regulations
(i)  The domestic prices of petroleum products and raw materials are set
at the actual or potential convertible currency import price 2/
regardless of source.  A producer's differential turnover tax is
levied on CMEA imports or domestic production of lower-priced
materials to raise the cost to the convertible currency price level.
(ii)  For manufactured goods sold only doaiestically, the actual or
potential import price sets the upper limit.
4.       Export-based Price Regulations
For metallurgical and aluminum products, and for enterprises which
sell at least 5% of total output to the convertible currency areas 3/,
different price rules apply to the products exported and the products sold
domestically.
(a)  On convertible currency exports producers receive the actual price in
foreign exchange, minus commercial costs, plus a turnover tax rebate
(6% in Jul, 1982), plus any subsidies which may be granted. On
non-convertible currency exports, the same rules apply except that
there is no turnover tax refund.
1/  The new system is referred to as the 1979-80 reform because consumer
prices were raised in advance, in July 1979.
2/ The forint price is the price in foreign exchange plus transportation and
customs duties, converted at the current exchange rate.
3/  For enterprises selling less than 5X of output to convertible currency
markets they are generally instructed to follow the price policies of the
largest firm with a similar product profile.



- 71 -
Appendix I
Page 2 of 2
(b)  On donestic sales, a series of rules on prices ard profit margins
apply to be enterprise's entire production anid to its average
domestic prices. The basic principle is that the donestic
profitability may not exceed profitability on convertible currency
exports.  Individual domestic prices may be set uccording to market
requirements. However, a domestic price may not exceed the import
price of a product of equivalent quality.
5.       To the extent that the determination of a potential import or export
price, especially where quality is a factor, is problematic, this opens the
system to price or administration by the authorities. Exemptions have grown,
along with special rules for certain items such as import-substituting
products and spare parts 1/.  Critics argue that the system has operated less
by market signalling and more as a continuation of a cost-plus system; also,
that the "correct" pricing of inputs can only have a limited inpact on
structural adjustment if enterprise profitability is mot the principal guide
to resource aLlocation, which appears to be the case. Purther reforms of the
pricing system are currently under review in Wt.ngary.
6.       For all other sectors, a cost-plus formulation is used.  ALI prices
are cleared by the M1aterials and Prices Board.
7.       Competitive prices apply to 65-70% of industrial production (see
Table 1).
Consumer Prices
8 ~   The primary objective of the 1980 price reform was to brirg consumer
prices closer to their costs as reflected in producer prices, but with two
exceptions.
(1)  Goods needed fo basic social needs (i.e. health, rent, food) would
continue to be subsidized.
(2)  Luxury items (i.e. alcohol, tobacco) would continue to have high
turnover taxes applied.
9.       In 1980, the share of consumer prices tc be freely determined rose
from 45% to 55% (see Table 2).
Producer Prices vs. Consumer Prices
10.      The fact that average producer prices have  ':-.  -IuL to average
consumer prices during the past two decades (and at   :.-   ceflects the
widespreaad system of taxes and subsidies:  these have  . - ;,.c iaJly depressed
consumer prices and artificially raised producer price. r !.noviri  the usual
spread.  Under the current five-year plan, consumer pri ,- aTe projected to
rise above producer prices by 4%.
1/  On Droducts which are import substitutes or spare parts, the import price
can be applied domestically.

OVERVIEW OF THE MATERIAL-SAVING AND
BACKGROUND INDUSTRIES PROGRAMS
The Background Industries Development Program
1.       The Government has been carrying out a large-scale in-depth study of
the development measures and investment programs required for building-up the
sector of background industries. This study has not been issued publicly so
far 1/, because of the possible upsurge of enterprises demand for credit and
machinery imports in a period of stringent credit restrictions and foreign
exchange scarcity. Indeed, the opportunities for development of background
industries and their related investments have been assessed to be so large as
to exceed the current financial capacity of the country. Under a scaled-down
scenario (whereby investments would be cut down by at least 40%), investments
required during the 1981-1985 Plan would total Fts 9.2 billion (US$230
million), of which Fts 6.4 billion (US$160 million) would be financed by
credit and Fts 2 billion by State grants as a promotional incentive 2/.
2.       The products on which the reduced program would focus comprise
essentially: precision die castings, in the foundry industry; tools, general
appliances and tooling, springs, hydraulic jacks, liquid pumps, gears, and
shaft couplings, in the machinery industry; cables, chemical batteries,
electrical revolving machines, in the electrical industry; plastic products,
chemicals of general use, conveying belts, stamped products, and rubber tools,
in the chemical and rubber industries. The study estimates that, as a result
of this development of background industries and the consequent upgrading of
the technological level of domestic components and of end-products
incorporatirn these components, the hard-currency exports could increase in
1985 by US$90 million p.a. directly, and hard-currency import-substitution of
parts and components used domestically would reach by 1985 another US$140
million p.a.
3.       The strategy recommended by the study for implementation of the
program relies maiAily on: cooperation with foreign companies for licences,
know-how and specialized manpower; reorganization of production facilities and
conversion of fi,.ed assets for use by the background industries; upgrading and
preparation of adequate standards in line with modern international
requirements; revision of pricing policies in support of quality products;
development of new marketing channels for exports. The promotion of the
background industries constitutes an important part of the industrial
restructuring program to be supported by the proposed project, and the
provision of foreign exchange resources is indispensible if it is not to be
postponed or cut out in the current period of credit and foreign exchange
rationing.
1/  Preliminary draft of the study is availablA in the Project File
(item no. 2).
2/ Over the period 1985-1990, the study projects additional investments
totalling Pts 11.1 billion (US$275 million) and credit needs of Fts 7.5
billion (US$185 million).

The Material-Saving Program
4.       The Government program for material-saving, officially denominated
"Program for economic use of materials and modernization of technologies" was
prepared on the basis of a 2-year study carried out thoroughly by some 15
technical committees comprising experts from about 100 large-scale enterprises
and material users 1/. This complex program, focusing on 15 product groups
(in steel, aluminum, fertilizers, wood, leather, textiles, paper, rubber,
plastics, packaging materials) representing 26-28% of all industrial material
consumption, includes a comprehensive array of measures and action proposals
for the dissemination of material-saving technologies, improvement of
processing .,odes, modernization of industrial designs and standards 2/, and
introduction of economi.. and legal incentives for enterprises managers
(pricing policies for raw materials, compliance to new standards, advisory
services, wage incentive policies). The material savings expe.cted from the
program would total about Ft 17 billion (US$500 million) by 1985 3/.  In the
first phase (1983-1985), the program will be confined to relatively small
projects with a short pay-back period; total investment costs would reach
Forints 1.5-2.0 billion p.a. with a foreign exchange component of Fts 300-600
million (US$7.5-15 million) p.a., and the demand for credit is estimated at
Fts 1.0-1.5 billion p.a.
1/ Study is available in the Project File (item no. 3).
2/ More than 50 industrial standards would be improved or introduced accor-
ding to international requirements in the areas of aluminum produicts,
steel products, gas pipes, castings and forgings, cem-nt, textiles, see
3/ Annual savings are estimated to reach 500,000 t of cement; 2,800 t of
aluminum; 3,000 t of steel rods, 40,000 t of steel structures; 40,000 of
castings,

NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY (NBH)
Establishment
1.       The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) and the State Development Bank are
the two main sources of investment finance for the productive sector in
ilungary. NBH was established as a joint stock company in 1924 and has been
wholly owned by the Government since 1967.  It has its own charter and
statutes.
2.      INBH functions both as the central bank and a commercial bank.  As the
central bank, it issues currency, regulates foreign exchange, establishes and
administrates credit policy, maintains gold and foreign exchange reserves, and
acts as the main banker for the Government. As a commercial bank, NBH accepts
deposits, and grants loans to Hungarian enterprises and cooperatives for
working capital and investment purposes. The later function of pr(iiding
long-term investment loans based on project viability can be called
development banking.
Organization, Management and Staff
3.       NBH has its head office (H.O.) in Budapest, and 19 regional offices
and 64 branches in Hungary. It also has five representative offices and two
banking subsidiaries abroad. An organization chart of NBH is given at
attachment I. The President of the bank is its chief executive and is
assisted by the Board of Management composed of a First Deputy President,
Deptuty Presidents, Managing Directcrs and non-executive members.  The
President and Deputy Presidents are appointed by the Council of Ministers.
The Managing Directors are appointed by the President, and the non-executive
members are elected at the General Meeting where the Government, as the
shareholder, is represented by officials from the Ministry of Finance. Each
Deputy president is responsible for five to six departments. All industrial
financing operations (except for the food industry) are grouped under one
Deputy President. Although the appraisal of individual projects is done in
the respective industrial credit departments. rhe Foreign Trade Department is
res,ponsible for overall control and coordination of projects to be financed
under NBH's export credit facility (para. 3.13 in the text).
4.       Working capital loans are approved at the branch level.  The
investment loans have different approval limits at the levels of branch
managers, department heads, Deputy Presidents and the Board of Management.
All investment Loans above Ft. 80 million ($2.0 million) l/ under the export
credit window, and all other industrial loans of above Ft. 100 million ($2.5
million), require the Board's approval. The project supervision work is
performed basically at the branch level. However, the H.O. is responsible for
the appraisal and supervision work in the Budapest area, except for small
projects and cooperatives. The H.O. also appraises all projects with
investment loans of above Ft 100 million ($2.5 million) and export oriented
projects for loans of above Ft 30 million ($0.8 million) each.
1/ Throughout this Annex an exchange rate of $1 = Ft 40 has been used.



-77-                           Aendix III
5.       NBiH has a total staff of about 6,400 persons) including 2,760 at the
H.O.  On the average, there are about 200 staff members in each regional
office.  The professional staff generally consists of economists.  The salary
level in NBH is better than in the manufacturing industry. The staff turnover
is low.  At the H.0., about 380 staff (including about 200 in supervisory and
professional positions) is engaged in the industrial sector operations. The
quality of staff is generally good but they need to enhance their experience
in project appraisal and supervision (paras. 9-13 below).
Policy
6.       The broad financing guidelines are provided by the Government
together with annual and five-year national development plans and annual
budgets.  Tnese are detailed in the Credit Guidelines issued annually.  The
Guidelines, which include credit allocation and lending criteria for priority
sectors and sub-sectors, are prepared by NBH in consultation with the National
Planning Office and the Ministry of Finance. Due to current balance of
payment constraints, high priority is being given to export-oriented
industries with short gestation and payback periods. Strict and selective
criteria are now being applied for project eligibility in this category. The
other high priority areas are import substitution, energy conservation,
material savings/recycling, and technological innovation.
7.       In 1982, NBH increased its interest rates rapidly; the general
interest on long-term investment loans became 14% in October 1982 compared to
8-9% in 1979-81. However, the export-oriented and energy rationalization
projects were allowed until January 1, 1984 a rebate of 45% of irnterest upon
successful completion of their targets; the rebate was 25% for import
substitution and material savings projects and 33% for material recycling
projects.
Standard Procedures 1/
8.       Project Identification and Development:  NBH staff at the H.O. and
branches maintains close contact with enterprises. Enterprises generally
contact NBH at a very early stage of their project preparation. NBH gives a
"#go-ahead" signal for the feasibility study after being satisfied with the
eligibility and preliminary review of the project. Large enterprises often
have their own staff for the preparation of feasibility studies; others engage
consultants. The feasibility studies provide information on technical
aspects, including costs, process, etc. The financial information is
generally prepared by the enterprise itself, and checked by NBH's loan
officers.
9.       Appraisal: The appraisal at the H.O. is performed at one of the four
concerned industry credit departments. During appraisal, NBH staff basically
performs a "checking" function on the information provided by the enterprise
1/ Other procedures will be used for Bank-financed projects; see para. 4.19
in the text.

and receives "clearances" from concerned ministries.  Up to July 1982, the
Ministry of Industry (MOI) used to examine the technical viability of every
manufacturing industry project, but it now formally reviews only those
projects which are included in the central development programs or those with
a tocal cost of above Ft. 500 million ($12.5 million).  However, NBH continues
to depend on the MOI for the technical evaluation of all projects un-ler an
informal arrangement.  NBH also consults the Council of Technical Development
on very large and/or new technology projects. The lazal and foreign trading
companies play an important role in providing views on marketing justification
and/or guaranteeing sale of products. In case of export-oriented projects.
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Foreign Trade Department of NBH also
give their comments/clearance on the marketing viability. As regards the
financial viability, the staff satisfies itself thiat the sale revenues will be
sufficient to cover costs and debt-servicing, and that the project will be
able to meet minimum profit criteria upon completion.
10.      For the purposes of loan approval, NBH uses a points system for
project rating based on project completion period, foreign exchange pay-back
period, size of domestic investment, loan repayment period, enterprise's own
investment, and profitability. Tne decision on a loan request is normally
taken within three months after the receipt of the loan application and
complete information from the enterprise.
11.      The appraisal does not include the calculations of ERR 1/ and FRR of
the project, and financial projections (income statements, cash Flow
statements and balance sheets over the next four to five years) for the
borrower are not prepared. NBH's project appraisal should be expanded to
cover the above. Also, in view of the reduced responsibility of MOI in the
technical appraisal of projects, NBH should make alternate arrangements. In
addition, NBH should not rely solely on the opinion and guarantees of the
trading companies on the market viability of projects and it should receive,
analyse, and interprete all data and information on the market justification
independently. During the appraisal, satisfactory understandings have been
reached with NBH on necessary measures to improve its appraisal procedures for
Bank-financed projects (para. 4.18 in the text).
12.      Supervision:  NBH branches mtaintain close financial relationship with
borrowers as their money transactions pass through the bank. The supervision
is basically of a financial nature. NBH does not have a regular project
monitoring system which may help to identify problems during early stages and
to initiate remedial measures, particularly in the technical area. NBH has
agreed with the appraisal mission to strengthen its supervision for Bank-
financed projects (para. 4.18 in the text).
13.      In order to assist in the reorientation of NBH's approach and proce-
dures for projects appraisal and supervision, and, thus, to intensify its
development banking role, a limited technical assistance (a consultant for at
least 3 months and foreign staff training) has been included in the proposed
project.
1/ NBH uses a modified economic cost-benefit analysis for large projects.

Page 4 ot 5'
14.      Procurement:  The procurement of imported machinery and equipment-is
generally through the international shopping and has to be cleared with the
Ministry of Foreign Trade. All orders for above $1.00 million require at
least three quotations. ICB has been started only recently in Hungary.
However, the enterprises and NBH would be in a position to follow the Bank's
guidelines on procurement. Specific understanding reached with NBH during the
appraisal on procurement under the proposed loan are described in para. 4.28
in the text.
15.      Disbursement: Disbursements are made against actual invoices and the
procedures are satisfactory. Enterprises are normally expected to use their
own funds (as provided in the project's financial plan) before withdrawing the
NBH loan.
Operations
16.      Working Capital Loans:  NBH's working capital loans have increased
from Ft 127.1 billion ($3.2 billion) on December 31, 1977 to Ft 170.6 billion
($4.3 billion) on June 30, 1982. About two-thirds of these loans were for the
short-term, and the balance for the medium-term. As of June 30, 1982, the
industry (including energy, mining, and construction) received 52% of the
total working capital loans, agriculture 23% and trade and other activities
25%.
17.      Investment Loans:  The investment loans (disbursements) of NBH to the
productive sector have decreased form Ft 24.8 billion ($0.62 billion) in 1977
to Ft 20.8 billion ($0.52 billion) in 1981. During the samc. period, loans to
manufacturing industries (including agro-industries) decreased from Ft 15.8
billion ($0.40 billion) to Ft 11.0 billion ($0.28 billion). The decrease in
investment loans to industries is the result of scarce foreign exchange
resources, credit squeeze, and more strict criteria of project financing in
recent years. Since 1979, NBH's sectoral emphasis has shifted considerably
with lesser funds for large engineering industries and more funds for
chemicals and agriculture. NBH credits in 1981-82 financed 30% of all
investments in engineering, light industry and building materials, chemicals
and almost 20% of agricultural investment. The total investment loan
portfolio of NBH was Ft 122.7 billion ($3.07 billion) on December 31, 1981 and
increased at an average rate of about 10% p.a. during the 1977-1981 period.
The manufacturing industries were the major borrowers with an aggregate share
of 57X in the portfolio of NBH as of December 31, 1981.
Operating Results and Financial Position
18.      Summarized profit and loss statements and balance sheets of NBH for
1978-82 are given in attachments II and III, respectively. NBH's accounts
have been audited by independent auditors since 1976.

Page 5 of 5
19.      During 1978-82, NBH's gross income has increased by 65% to Ft 57.4
billion ($1.43 billion), but the net profit has decreased by 45% to Ft 7.5
billion ($0.19 billion). Interest was 90% of the total income and 95% of the
total expenditure in 1982. A significant increase in interest expenses
without a corresponding timely increase in interest income explains for a
lower profitability. The increase in the interest rates in 1982 and 1983
would help to increase the profits. This would, however, be an incidental
effect of the Government's objective to follow a more realistic interest rate
policy. The increase in NBH's profits is neither an objective of the
Government nor of the NBH. All net profits, after appropriation for reserves
(to meet losses and to finance anticipated capital expenditures), are
transferred to the Government - the sole shareholder - as dividends.
20.      The main sources of NBH's funds are, besides foreign loans, the
deposits of the Government, state enterprises, and the state insurance
company; they are obliged to maintain their deposits with NBH. In addition,
the other Hungarian banks also keep a part of their balances with NBH.
21.      The short- and long-term loan portfoiios of NBH have increased by 65%
and 22% respectively during the 1978-1981 period. Enterprises' borrowings
were 56% of the total portfolio at the end of 1982. NBH's loan recovery
position is highly satisfactory; there were no write offs in the 1978-1982
period. The postponement of investment loan maturities has also been very
small ranging between Ft 1.1 billion (9 cases) and Ft 2.7 billion (30 cases)
in the last four years. NBH carries foreign exchange risk on its foreign
currency loans. Due to devaluation of Forint, NBH incurred a loss of Ft 19.1
billion in 1982, but, as per the Government's decision, it was written off
against the reserve funds deposited by enterprises with NBH.
22.      NBH's overall financial position can be considered fully
satisfactory, keeping in view its Government ownership, its role as a central
bank, its close operational relationship with borrowing enterprises and banks,
and its impressive record of loan recovery.
Future Role
23.      NBH will continue to play a pivotal role in the Hungarian economy.
It would contribute to the diversion of investment funds to high priority
areas through its credit policies and lending programns. NBH's lending plans
are guided by the Government's five-year plans. Under the present plan
(1981-85), NTBH expects to provide investment Icans (disbursements) of Ft 20
billion ($0.50 billion) in 1983 and about Ft 25 billion ($0.60 billion) each
in 1984 and 1985. The manufacturing sector is expected to receive 25-3S% of
these funds.

THE CREDIT PACKAGE SUBPROJECTS
I. Export-Generation Subprojects
1.01     Fagazdasagi Kombitiat (Wood-working plant of Western Hungary)
(a)  The Company, created in 1974, has been engaged in the vertically
integrated processing of wood products, from forestry and logging to
chipboard and furniture manufacturing.  It employs a total of 4,000
labor force (of which 50 engaged in R and D), mostly for logging and
furniture production, and had total net fixed assets of Ft 1,700
million (US$42.5 million) by end of 1982.  The management is highly
capable and dynamic. Total sales of the company increased by 6.5%
p.a. in recent years and reached Ft 2,143 million (US$53.3 million)
in 1982, of which Ft 306 million for convertible currenkcy exports.
The company's profit before tax was Ft 435 million (US$ll million) in
1982, and the financial situation is sound. One of the company's
major production Lines has been the production of particle boards,
manufactured under a licence from West Germany; this production line
absorbs 800 workers and staff. Current production of particle and
chipboards totals about 2.5 million m2 p.a., 20% of which in the
form of cemented chip boards (a board where chips are mixed with
cement acting as a filling and cohesive agent). The cemented chip-
boards, introduced in 1978 under a western licence, have met with
high demand on the domestic and export markets; the company's ro-
duction represents 30% of total European output (1.5 million mn
and its exports some 15% of west european markets. Total demand for
cemented chipboards in Western Europe is currently estimated at 1.2
million m2 and growing quickly; these chipboards are progressively
substituting for asbestos-cemeat boards (112 million m2 presently
used) due to health protection and higher quality reasons.
(b)  The Project's purpose is to build-up additional capacity for the
production of I million m2 p.a. of surfaced cemented chipboards cut
to measures for building and construction assembly. Over half of the
additional output would be exported to convertible currency markets.
Total project cost would be Ft 177 million (US$4.4 million), of which
US$2.79 million in foreign exchange. Imported equipment would be
procured through international bidding. Implementation would take
place during the period April 1984-October 1985. Capacity utiliza-
tion of the proiect facilities would build-up to 100% over the first
3 years operations, which is realistic. The Bank's line of credit
would finance 63% of the project cost, company's internal funds
another 25%, and NBH's local currency credit the balance.
(c)  The Benefits would be to provide in equal shares both the domestic
and convertible currency markets with a highly demanded product.
Project sales would total Ft 320 million (US$8 million) p.a. at full
capacity (to be reached in 1987), of which at least US$4 million as



- 85 -                   Appendix IV
Page 2 of 16
convertible currency export earnings. The company should riot 'iave
difficulties to market annually 500,000 m2 of cemented chipboards
in convertible currency markets, in view of the quaLity of its
current production and the highly competitive prices at which it
plans to sell its product (US$8 per m , as compared to a range of
US$12 to I? per m2 in Western Europe). Given that the project
would process a local resource (wood), the net foreign exchange gains
of the project would reach at full capacity US$3.0 million p.a. after
depreciation of imported machinery and US$3.06 million before depre-
ciatiorn, and would aggregate over the first 3 years of operation a
total of US$5.82 million before depreciation. The project would
generate to the company additional profits before tax of about Ft 32
million (US$0.8 million) per year. The project FIR has been computed
at 23% and the ERR at 24-29%.
1.02     Szalamigyar es Huskombinat (Pick Salami Factory), Szeged
(a) The Company is a major meat packing plant, and its facilities include
slaughterhouses and meat processing facilities. It employs 2,540, of
which 80% are skilled workers.  During 1982, carcass meat production
totalled 19,300 tons, of which 24% were exported to convertible
currency markets. Meat products and sausages other than salami
amounted to 8,000 tons, essentially for domestic consumption. Salami
production, a major and profitable product of the company, totalled
10,300 tons, of which 6,700 tons were exported (3,700 tons to con-
vertible currency markets). The required supply of pigs and cattle
(respectively 570,000 and 26,000 heads per year), as well as product
sales, are governed by long-term contracts. There is strict control
on animals and products, and the company's major export product,
salami sausage, has recently been approved by the US Food and Dr'_g
Administration. Total sales in 1982 were Ft 5,518 miLlion ($151
million), of which 39% was salami, 31% carcass meat, while the
remainder was spread over various meat products. Company's exports
totalled Ft 2,410 million in 1982, of which Ft 1,840 million ($50
million) to convertible currency markets. The financial situiation of
the company is sound.
(b)  The Project:  The proposed Ft 311 million ($7.8 million) project
would update the technology used, increase hygiene and quality
control, and will enable the company to expand its meat production
and allow it to add a new variety of salami to its product range.
The equipment, most of which will have to be imported from non-
socialist countries, is for slaughtering and will cost an estimated
$2.81 million in foreign exchange; it will be procured by inter-
national tender. Financing for the Ft 311 million project would be
provided by the company (Ft 102 million, or 33%), the National Bank
of Hungary (Ft 83 million, or 27%), and $2.81 million (Ft 126
million, or 40X) from the Bank's Industrial Credit.

Page 3 of 16
(c)  The Benefits of the project would result in an increase of Ft 480
million ($11.4 million) in annual company sales, of which at least
68% as exports, and generate Ft 70 million ($1.7 million) it, addi-
tional profit before taxes per year; the net foreign exchange gains
of the project would reach at full capacity $4.5 million before
depreciation, In addition, there would be an upgrading of the
technology used, resulting in improved hygienic conditions and better
quality control. The subproject's design was reviewed by the
Hungarian health authorities, and was found to meet the Government's
strict environmental regulations which are appropriate. The FRR has
been estimated at 34%, and the ERR at 27-35%.
1.03     Chinoin (Pharmaceuticals) - Budapest
(a)  The Company has been in operation since 1913, and is one of Hungary's
main manufacturers in the important pharmaceutical industry. It has
license and collaboration agreements with firms in the Federal
Republic of Germany, Switzerland and the UK. Product-mix comprises
mainly dosage-form tablets and injections for established ethical
medicines described in the WhO list of essential medicines, manu-
factured from basic raw materials. 1982 production was 4.1 billion
tablets and 83 million injection ampules. The company had in 1982 a
total employment of 5,000 and net fixed assets of Ft 1,675 million
(US$42 million). Bank consultants commented favorably on the tech-
nological competence of the management and senior staff.  Total sales
in 1982 were Ft 6,252 million ($156 million), of which $4.95 million
(Ft 185 million) were exported to Western countries, and Ft 1,744
million to non-convertible currency areas; exports have increased by
an average 16% per year during the last 3 years. The financial
situation of the company is sound, with pre-tax profits of Ft 538
million (US$14.7 millicn) in 1982.
(b)  The Project:  The aim is to expand and modernize the production areas
tor tablets and ampules, and to meet fully the requirements of WHO's
international Good ManL.facturing Practices (GNP). For the tablet
produccion, this involves the construction of a new building (with
appropriate hygienic conditions) and the purchase of mixing, tablet-
ting and auxiliary equipment. For the ampule production, the
existing buildings (sterile areas in buildings is part of the manu-
facturing technology) will be refurnished and an additional filling
line will be installed. The project, co be completed ini 2 years by
end of 1985, will increase tablet production by 500 million tablets
per year, while ampule production will go up by 10 million ampules
per year. The proposed project was supported by the Bank consul-
tants. The total cost of the project will be Ft 378 million ($9.5
million) , of which 40% or Ft 153 million ($3.88 million) in direct
convertible currencies will be funded by the IBRD line of credit,
Ft 130 million (35%) by NBH's local currency loan, and Ft 94 million
(25%) by the company.

Page 4 of 16
(c) The Benefits; The company will upgrade its technology to meet GMP
requirements. At the same time it will increase both its ampule and
tablet production capacities by 12% to meet increasing export demands.
All project output is projected to be exported to convertible
currency markets after three years of productiou; reasonable market
justification was provided. The project will generate at full
capacity additional sales of Ft 283 million (US$7.1 million), and an
increase in profits before taxes of Ft 80 million ($1.9 million) per
year. The project's net foreign exchange gains at full capacity
would reach $5.4 million p.a. The FRR has been estimated at 14-31%,
and the ERR at 17-35%.
1.04     Vaci Kottotarugyar Knitwear Facr
(a) The Company employs 2,700 people and is engaged in manufacturing of
3,500 tons of knitted articles, mostly jogging suits, sport shirts
and bathing suits. The manufacturing includes knitting, dyeing,
finishing and sewing. Knitting and dyeing operate on three shifts,
and garment manufacturing on two shifts. From 1979 to 1982 the
production increased from 4.9 to 5.9 million pieces (MP), of which
exports from 1.2 to 1.6 MP. In value exports to convertible currency
countries increased in the same period from Ft 97 million to Ft 163
million ($4.0 million) and accounted for about 15% of the total
sales. In addition, exports to non-convertible currency countries
amounted to Ft 114 million (US$2.85 million). In the last three
years the value of sales increased from Ft 1.07 to Ft 1.13 billion
(US$30.5 million), while due to increase of sales to hard currency
markets, the profits increased from Ft 60 to Ft 102 million (US$2.75
million). The management is technically competent and export
oriented, as reflected in several licensing agreements with leadi.ng
European companies which are using the company's products for their
top-line brand name articles.
(b) The Project: in order to increase exports the company is planning to
invest about Ft 197 million ($4.9 million), including $2.73 million
in foreign exchange to add modern knitting, dyeing and garment manu-
facturing equipment to expand production by 200 tons from 5.2 to 6.1
MP. The company plans to purchase 12 additional high capacity versa-
tile knitting machines and scrap 22 obsolete unit (over 20 years
old), as well as add three high pressure dyeing units required to
handle synthetics as well as 75 sewing machines and auxiliary equip-
ment. Nqo civil works are required and implementation period of 12
months appears to be realistic. The Bank's line of credit would
provide 56% of the project cost, the National Bank of Hungary 19%,
and the company 25%.
(c)  The Benefits:  All incremental production and sales are destined for
convertible currency markets, mainly EEC. After the expansion is
completed, the exports of jogging suit, sport and leisure wear and



- 88 -                   Appendix IV
Page 5 of 16
bathing suit would account for 50% of the company sales.  The pro-
posed investment is estimated by the company to generate additional
revenues of about Ft 163 million ($4.0 million), and increase net
profits by Ft 30 million ($0.7 million). The labor force (mainly in
the garment department) is expected to increase by about 150 ope-
rators, i.e. by about 5% as compared with a 12% increase in produc-
tion. consequently, productivity which already is in the order of
80% of that of USA (85% of EEC countries) will be further increased.
The project's net foreign exchange earnings at full capacity would
reach US$1.8 million p.a. The FRR has been estimated at 15-22% and
the ERR at 18-24%.
1.05     Magyarovori Kottotarugyar Knitwear Factory
(a) The Company employs 3,125 people, is technologically progressive and
well-managed, and is engaged in manufacturing of knitted articles
such as underwear, tennis shirts, sport shirts, pullovers and
cardigans. The manufacturing includes knitting, dyeing, finishing,
cutting and sewing. Production (in terms of pieces produced) has
been decreasing from 19.0 million pieces (MP) in 1980 to 17.4 HP in
1982. At the same time the weight of production increased from 3,086
metric tons (MT) to 3,315 MT indicating a trend away from highly
competitive (light) underwear articles towards higher value and more
profitable outwear items. In the last three years, the sales and
profits have been increasing modestly, by 8.9% and 16.3% respec-
tively, reaching in 1982 Ft 1,267 million (US$34.6 million) and Ft 82
million (US$2.2 million) respectively.  The exports to convertible
currency countries (mostly EEC) have been increasing by 7.5% in 1980
and 8.3% in 1982 (in current forints). In terms of volume, the
exports actually decreased from 2.0 MP in 1980 to 1.4 MP in 1982,
reflecting increased competition and depressed economic conditions in
the EEC markets.
(b) The Project: In order to increase exports the company is planning to
invest about Ft 131 million ($3.25 million), including up to $2.l
million foreign exchange (of which additional working capital
estimated to range between US$83,000 and US$424,000), into modern
knitting and dyeing equipment to improve the quality of their
products (relating mostly to dimensional stability in washing) in
order to develop new business with more prestigious Europear
companies. No civil works are required and the implementation period
of 12 months appears to be realistic. Of the total project cost. the
Bank's line of credit would contribute up to 71%, the National Bank
of Hungary 4%, and the company 25%.
(c) The Benefits: The project would result in additional production of
0.52 million of higher value pieces (about 220 MT), 90% of which are
to be sold for export to the convertible currency markets. The pro-
posed investments is estimated by the company to result in additional



- 89 -                   Appendix IV
Page 6 of 16
revenues of Ft 99 million ($ 2.4 million) of which Ft 90 million
($2.10 million) from exports, and additional pre-tax profits of Ft 19
million ($ 0.45 million). The labor content per piece is about I
man-hour at a cost of Ft 23 ($ 0.57), giving the company a compara-
tive economic advantage in exports, especially as productivity is
estimated at 60%-80Z of the USA/EEC standards. The project's net
foreign exchange gains would total US$4.15 million over the first
four years of operation, reaching US$1.3 million p.a. at full capa-
city. The FRR and ERR have been estimated respectively at 16-23% and
17-26%.
1.06     Egyt (Pharmaceuticals) - Budapest
(a)  The Company was formed in 1948 by amalgamation of several small
firms. Total staff now numbers 3,600, including 300 in Research and
Development and 200 in quality control. The company had by the end
of 1982 total net fixed assets of Ft 1,920 million (US$48 million).
The company produces a fairly wide range of ethical and generic
drugs, by chemical synthesis; the product-mix includes veterinary
drugs. The company has been developing some original new products,
and has entered licensing arrangements and technology exchanges with
foreign firms (such as Sandoz, Astra, Bayer). Sales of the company
increased by 9% p.a. in recent years and totalled Ft 47,177 million
(US$110 million) in 1982, of which US$25 million in convertible
currency exports (mostly in bulk form). Sales abroad comprise the
traditional mix of bulk supplies to developed (and few developing)
countries and dosage forms irainly to the developing countries.
Egyt's production procedures and technical staff appear quite
satisfactory. The company's profit before tax was Ft 338 million
(US$9.2 million) in 1982. Its financial performance and management
need strengthening; the profits expected from the project would
contribute substantially to it.
(b)  The Project's purpose is to expand the capacity of existing pro-
duction lines for active principles and phanmaceutical formulae,
through the purchase of new equipment and control instruments plus
some machinery relocation in existing buildings. The additional
production will be entirely exported to convertible currency
markets. The pharmaceuticals to be produced are all on the WHO basic
drugs list, and are not likely to become obsolescent. The company
has the technical know-how, including sufficient experience for the
production of three compounds which it will produce for the first
time. The products which are well defined by pharmacopoeial stan-
dards will be produced under the company's stringent standards; the
existing quality control system meets international requirements.
About 80% of the base fine chemicals will be imoorted. The project's
total cost is estimated at Ft 354 million (US$8.8 million), of whici
US$2.7 million in convertible currencies. Implementation would take
place during the period January 1984-December 1985, with initial



- 90 -                   Appendix IV
Page 7 of 16
production in early 1985. Capacity utilization would build-up frorn
55% to 95% in three years, which is realistic. The Bank's line of
credit will finance 30% of the project cost, company's inLernal funds
25%, and NBH's local currency loan the balance.
(c) Trhe Benefits of the project will be essentially to increase the
company's sales (and convertible currency exports) by Ft 240 million
and an equivalent of US$4.55 million (net of existing production) at
full capacity. Project output will consist of veterinary products
(US$2.5 million), finished products in dosage form (US$0.95 million)
and bulk supplies (US$1.1 million); adequate market justification was
provided. All products are well known generics, and no issue of
product clearance is foreseen. The project will also improve further
the quality control system, with the purchase of additional laborm-
tory and in-line process control equipmnent. Company's profits before
tax would be increased by Ft 62 million (US$1.48 million). The
project's net foreign exchange gains at full capacity would reach
US$4.7 million p.a. The FRR has been estimated at 18-27% and the FRR
at 17-25%.
1.07     VBKM (electrical circuit breakers) - Budapest
(a) The Company was established in 1982 as a spin-off from the GANZ
Electric Conglomerate. Total staff presently numbers about 5,040;
its net fixed assets by end of 1982 totalled Ft 855 million (US$23
million). VBKM produces a wide product-mix of equipments and devices
for the supply and consumption of electrical power, ranging from
consumer appliances ("white goods") to high-voltage substation
switchgear and terminal strips (45% of output value). The company
has four plants, and an R and D subsidiary of 225 staff operating for
all the former GANZ companies. The company shares about half of the
Hungarian markets for the Low and high-voltage equipment, connection
fittings and control/regulating equipment, and is the sole producer
of high-voltage circuit breakers of switchgears. VBKM has been
producing for 20 years 36 KV oil-filled circuit breakers under a
licence from the Belgian Company EIB. Sales of the company totalled
Ft 2,540 million (US$69 million) in 1982, of which 15% were exported
in convertible currency markets (mainly Kuwait, Greece, Egypt,
Middle-East) through the bids won by the TRANSELEKTRO and
ELEKTROIMPEX foreign trade companies for electrical transmission and
distribution equipment; convertible currency exports of oil-filled
circuit breakers produced by VBKM have ranged between US$3 and 4
million p.a. in the past five years. The company's profit before tax
was Ft 122 million (US$3.3 million) in 1982. The company's
management is dynamic and technically competent, and its financial
situation is satisfactory and makes it creditworthy.



- 91 -                   Appendix IV
Page 8 of 16
(b) The Project: In order to retain, and possibly expand, its position
on the export markets which increasingly require electrical equipment
of more modern technology and in particular vacuum circuit breakers,
VBKM has entered into a licencing agreement with Hitachi of Japan for
the production of vacuum circuit breakers which are more reliable and
more economic in maintenance than the oil-filled circuit breakers
currently produced by VBKM. The project is designed to expand in two
plants of the company its production capacity for circuit breakers
from 1,100 pieces p.a. to 2,100 pieces p.a. by 1986-87; the capacity
for oil-filled equipment would decrease from 1,100 to 600 pieces
p.a., and that for vacuum circuit breakers would be built-up with
Hitachi technical assistance to 1,500 pieces p.a, Convertible
currency exports are projected to reach about 1,200 pieces p.s.,
which is reasonable in view of past years' achievement. Parts and
components will be initially imported and assembled, and will be
substituted for by locally-made components in 196. The project cost
would total up to Ft 98 (US$2.3 million), with a foreign exchange
Cost of up to $0.98 million (including additional working capital
ranging between US$245,00 and 400,000 for Hitachi parts and sub-
components to be assembled during the first year of operation). The
Barik's loan would finance up to $0.98 million (45% of project's tctal
cost); the company's own funds would provide 25% of the cost, and
NBH's local currency A.oan the balance.
Cc) The Benefits: The project would generate additional sales of Ft 200
million p.a. at full capacity, of which $3.8 million (0t 160 million)
in convertible currency exports, and additional profits before tax of
Ft 30 million (US$0.7 million). The net foreign exchange earnings
would increase from $0.670 million in 1985 to $1.72 million in 1986,
and total $6.1 million over the first four years of operation. In
addition, the technology of VBKM's products and production processes
would be upgraded to recent international developments. The FRR has
been computed at 34% and the ERR at 23%.
II.   Material-Saving and Background Industries Subprojects
2.01     Ganz (Switches and Contactors) - Budapest
(a) The Company operates four plants, and is one part of Ganz Electric
which was broken up into smaller companies in 1982 (see para above).
The company produces a variety of magnetic switches, relays, circuit
breakers and other sit.iilar electro-mechanical equipment for the
electrical industry; 40% of the finished products is made under
western licenses, and all its products are sold as components to
domestic equipment: manufacturers (some of which export), or to
contractors. Employment at the Budapest factory where the project is
located was 1,411 in 1982, and no additional personnel will be
required. Total sales were Ft 858 million in 1982 (about $21
million), profits were Ft 133 million and total net fixed assets were
Ft lj3 million. The company's financial situation is satiGfactory.



- 92 -                   Appendix IV
Page 9 of 16
(b)  The Project:  Ganz presently uses 7.9 tons of silver per year for
manufanturing electric contacts ($2.4 million at $310/kg), and pro-
fits are highly sensitive to swings in the silver price. The project
intends to use a Hungarian patent to reduce silver consumption in the
fabrication ot a group of products (which are not under foreign
licences imposing the amount of silver on each contact) by 1.4 tons
per year. Hioreover, the company would save subcontracting fees paid
to an East-German company presently manufacturing these products.
The investment cost for the project is Ft 46 million ($1.1 million).
The cost of imported equipment, and a small amount of training
abroad, will amount to Ft 28 maillion ($0. 7million, 60% of the project
cost) and will be financed under the IBRD line of credit; the
National Bank of Hungary will contribute Ft 4 million (8x), and the
company Ft 14 million (31%) to the project. Project implementation
would require 21 months.
(c) The Benefits of the project are essentially in the saving of 1.4 tons
of imported silver per year; at an assumed cost of $310 per kg, the
annual savings would amount to $0.44 million. Taking into account
additional costs (tooling essentially) to be incurred, annual savings
in operating costs would total Ft 12.5 million. Sales are also
expected to increase by a marginal Ft 8 million per year, replacing
some imports, and profits by Ft 6 million per year.  The FRR has been
calculated as 20%, and the ERR to range between 29% and 50%.
2.02     Papiripari Vallalat Straw Pulp Project, Dunaujvaros
(a) The Company, Papiripari Vallalat, is a large industrial complex ope-
rating in all aspects of the pulp, paper and cardboard production.
It employs a total of about 14,000 people in 15 different plants with
total net fixed assets of Forints 10,665 million (US$266 million) by
end of 1982. Total sales of the company increased by 8.5% p.a. in
recent years and reached Ft 16,665 million (US$416 million) in 1982,
and the company's profit before tax Ft 1,292 million (US$32.3
million). Convertible currency exports of the Company have ranged
between Ft 350 and 400 million (US$9 to 10 million) per year. The
Company's plant of Dunaujvaros was created in 1962 and is engaged in
the production of pulp and paper products, with a labor force of
about 2,300 and fixed assets of about Ft 3,700 million (US$92.5
million). The plant has been operating a unit for the production of
pulp from unutilized wheat straws in substitution for lower grade
soft wood pulp; the agricultural sector produces an average of 1.3
million tons per year of straw, of which about 50,000 tons are
consumed by the plant. The production of straw pulp is integrated
downwards in the Company's fabrication of paper products.
(b) The Project with a Ft 589 million (US$14 million) total cost, of
which US$6.39 million in foreign exchange, would rebuild worn-out
components of the existing 20,000 tpy capacity for straw pulp with



- 93 -                   Appendix IV
Page 10 of 16
modern machinery in order to maintain current production and to
reduce substantially the consumption of energy and materials (straw,
chemicals); the project wo"ld also increase the capacity by 10,000
tpy. The plant components dating from 1962 and presently severely
corroded, which rneed replacement, include the digesting, washing and
screening, and bleaching units; the straw handling and the dewatering-
finishing units would be adjusted to the increased capacity. The
project plant operates extensive water and effluent recycling
facilities, and a large modern effluent treatment plant (capacity of
62,000 m3 per day) which meets Government regulations for effluents
released in the Danube (COD of 500 mg/l). Equipment would be
procured through international tenderihg. Project implementation
would require about 2 years starting October 1983, and retroactive
financing wo'ild be needed for about $0.5 million. The Bank's line of
credit would finance 48% of the project cost, the comapany would
finance 25% from its reserves, and NBH's local currency credit the
balance.
(c)  The Benefits of t;:e project would accrue mainly from energy and
material-savings under the continued production of 20,000 tpy. At
full capacity (t_ be reached in 1986 or 1987), the economic benefits
(operating profit) of che projecc would total Ft 139 million p.a.
(US$3.5 million) of which 61% due to energy and material-savings and
39% to the additional output of 10,000 tpy. Savings of straw would
be minimal (2,000 tpy), as opposed to large savings on chemicals (Ft
24 millions, equivilent $0.6 million p.a.), energy (2.08 million kWh
p.a.) and maintenance/repair costs which would have been necessary
otherwise to maintain existing facilities in production. Total
savings would represent 27% of total operating production costs for
the 20,000 tpy capacity. Straw pulp would be sold domestically at a
price competitive with border prices of import-substitutes
(eucalyptus pulp). The FRR ranges between 16% and 27%, and the ERR
between 16% and 27% depending on the sensitivity assumptions. The
project would generate additional sales cf Ft 206 million and annual
profits before tax of about Ft 48 million (US$1.2 million).
2.03     Hungaria Plastic Works, Szombathely Plant (PVC Foil Project)
(a)  The Company is a leading producer of pvc plastic products, with sales
of Ft 2,942 million ($80 million) and net fixed assets of Ft 1,338
million (US$36 million) in 1982. The financial situation of the
company is satisfactory, with pre-tax profits of Ft 334 million
(US$9.1 million) in 1982.  The pvc powder used by the company (40,000
t/yr) is produced in Hungary, and there is sufficient production
capacity (178,000 tons/year) in the country to allow for increased
consumption by Hungaria; additives and other chemicals (14,000 t) are
purchased from abroad.  The main products of the company are floor
coverings, pvc pipes, food packaging containers (using hard pvc



- 94 -                   Appendix IV
Page 11 uo 16
foil), and household equipmer.t.  The company recycles its pvc wastes,
which amount to about 12,700 tons p.a.; due to the s!-ortnge of recy-
clng capacity, only 10,500 tons p.a. can presently be recycled and
the 'alance is burnt. The management is highly capable and dynamic,
the :'roduction facilities are modern, and productivity is high and
increasing.  Total employment in the company's three plants in 1982
was ',800, including 140 engineers and technicians.  One plant
produces hard pvc-foil used for packaging, particularly in the form
of containers for food products. At present, Hungaria manufacturers
3,060 tons per ye:ar on 3-shift production, equivalent to 47% of the
total national p-oduction of 6,560 tons; direct imports and exports
of hard pvc foil are currently insignificant. There has been a
substantial unsatisfied demand for this product, of about 2,600 tons
in 1983, particularly for food packaging, including packaging for
exports; demand is expected to increase at 10% per year in future.
Detailed market studies have been prepared by the company.
(b)  The Project will increase production capacity of pvc foil by 3,000
tons per year, and will consist of installing in existing facilities
a $0.1 million dispenser/mixer unit, a $1.0 million calenderette
machine line (extruder, foil drawing, finisher, stripper, shaper,
cooler and reel-up units), and a $0.1 million slitting and winding
machine. The project will moreover allow for the recycling of addi-
tional 2,200 tons p.a. of pvc wastes for the production of the pvc
foil. Due to the advanced technology, better mixing and faster
processing as compared to existing units, and the use of recycled
wastes, the requirements for pvc powder can be reduced by 58%
{savings of 1,300 tons p.a.) and those for the imported additives by
50% (savings of .50 tons p.a.).  In addition the new unit will be
able to produce foil of 1,500 mm width, as compared to the 900 mm
width of existing equipment, thus permitting a wider product-mix and
less waste. The total project cost is Ft 75 million ($1.9 million),
of which $1.34 million (71% of total cost) in direct convertible
currencies to be financed from the IBRD line of credit, Ft 3 million
(4%) from the Nationial Bank of Hungary, and Ft 19 million (25%)
provided from company funds.
(c)  The BenefiLs:  The project will double the production capacity, and
investment costs are low as existing buildings and support services
can be utilized. The new foil can be produced with less additives
and pvc powder, reducing raw material costs by some Ft 30.6 million
(US$0.75 million) per year at full capacity as compared to existing
production techniques.  Pending growth of the local market to take up
all the additional production, export contracts for pvc foil to the
Federal Republic of Germany will be continued (about $0.5 million per
year); a substantial proportion of the output is also exported indi-
tectly as packaging material for processed foods. The $1.9 million
project is expected to generate Ft 164 million ($3.9 million) in



- 95 -                   Appendix IV
Page 12 of 16
annual sales, and Ft 57 million (about $1.4 million) profit betore
taxes per y2ar. The FRR is estimated at 84%; the ERR (based on
internatioril prices) is : lculated at 93% withi a zero value (present
opportunity cost) for pvc wastes, and remains abe,ve 36% when pvc
wastes are costed according to Hungariau practices (56% of pvc powder
cost).  These returns are high, and are ext lained by the low invest-
ment costs and by the dual benefits of the project (material-savings,
and output expansion); under the most pessimistic assumptions, this
project is highly profitable a'td economically viable.
2.04     Hungaria Plastic Works, Debrecen Plant (PVC Pipe Project)
(a)  The Company (see para. 2.03) is also a leading producer of pvc pipes
and pipe fittings, which are used as components in industrial, agri-
cultural and domestic installations. As indicated in the previous
praragraphs, there is sufficient production capacity for pvc powder
(178,000 tons/year) in the country to allow for increased consumption
by Hungaria.
(b)  The Project:  The Hungaria plant at Debrecen, which produces all pvc
pipes manufactured in Hungary, will be expanded to raise production
from 20,000 tons to 25,000 tons per year of pipe - Ad pipe fittings.
Equipment to be purchased consist of three pipe extrusion lines with
auxiliary equipment, and six pipe fitting moulding machines, with a
total foreign exchange cost in convertible currencies of $3.95
million (Ft 158 million) to be provided from the World Bank loan (41%
of the total project cost of Ft 388 million). The company will
contribute 25%, and the National Bank of Hungary 34% of the required
financing. The market for the pipes is justified on the basis of
domestic demand, in particular in the construction and civil works
industry.
(c)  The Benefits:  The project will increase by 25% the production
capacity for pipes and fittings (background industries products),
improve quality, and will allow the company to replace worn-out
equipment. When in full production in 1987, the company's annual
sales will be increased by Ft 410 million ($10 million), and the
resulting additional profit before tax to the company will be Ft 69
million ($1.65 million). The additional sales of the company will
reduce by a corresponding amount the import requirements of pipes,
and thus generate net foreign exchange savings. The FRR has been
calculated to range between 19 ar.d 31%, and the ERR between 22 and
41%.
2.05     Magyar Acelarugyar (Twist Drills) - Budapest
(a)  The Company has three plants producing twist drills, springs, and
vehicle chassis. Total sales in 1982 were Ft 776 million ($19.4
million), of which about one-quarter was from twist drills
(production 10 million drills per year of up to 65 mm diameter). The



- 96 -                   Appendix IV
Page 13 of 16
company has adequate technological knowledge, uses foreign know-how
where appropriate, and has produced twist drills for over 50 years.
The domestic demand for twist drills is higher and over a wider rarge
of products than production capacity can tiupply, resulting in imports
equal to about half of domestic demand; however, about 40% of the
company's production is exported, indicating that the company's pro-
ducts are competitive. The company's financial position is satisfac-
tory, with net fixed assets of Ft 195 million (US$4.9 million) and
profit before tax of Ft 67 million (US$1.7 million) in 1982.  Employ-
ment was 1,400 people in 1982, one third of which for the production
of twist drills.
(b)  The Project:  The Ft 223 million ($5.3 million) project will ration-
alize and expand production facilities for twist drills (typical of
background industries products), and will update manufacturing tech-
nology to permit titanium coating of all product categories and to
bring products up to quality and price levels fully competitive in
Western markets. Equipment, to be purchased in the West, includes a
drill groove-grinding machine, a titanium nitrate coating plant, hot
rolling machines, centerless grinders, and auxiliary equipment, with
a foreign exchange cost of $2.7 million (Ft 115 million). The IBRD
line of credit will provide foreign exchange for the equipment pur-
chases equal to Ft 115 million, the company's internal funds would
contribute for Ft 70 million (31%), and the NBH would finance the
balanrci (17%).
(c)  The Benefits:  The new equipment will provide the company with modern
machinery to replace obsolete equipment (12 to 23 year-old), to com-
pensate for scarce skilled labor, and to supplement its product range
with high quality drills up to Western standards. Sales volume will
increase by some 1.6 million (higher quality) drills, or about 35%,
while the sales value of twist drills dill double by additional
Ft 165 million ($4. million), of which Ft 40 million ($0.95 million)
as exports, thus filling as of 1986 the supply shortfall. Net profit
before taxes is estimated to increase by Ft 40 million ($0.95
million). Implementation of the project mav take up to 2 years,
partly due to the delivery times of the special machines. The FFR
has been calculated as 27a%; the ERR, based on international prices
which are on average 25% higher than domestic prices, ranges between
34% and 49%.
2.06     Kontakta (Electro-mechanical Components) - Budapest
(a)  The Company produces connectors, micro-switches, miniature relays and
equipment consoles for the electronic industry; the company manufac--
tures 90% of the domestic production for these products made in
Hungary, and satisfies 60% of the domestic demand. Most of the comr
ponents are manufactured to international (DIN) standards. Total
employment in 1982 was 3,200 full-time and 800 part-time employees,



97 -                   Appendix IV
Page 14 of 16
working two to three shifts depending on the machines used. Sales
ihave increased steadily, and in 1982 were Ft 1,620 million ($40.5
million).  Tne company's financial situation is sound, with net fixed
assets of Ft 600 million (US$15 million) and profits before tax of Ft
248 million ($6.2 million) in 1982.
(b) The Project: The increasing use of micro-electronics requires new
miniature components, and Kontakta plans to introduce twelve new
lines of such accessories (background industries products) over the
next five years. For this the company need. better precision dies
and moulds for its metal stamping operations. For the manufacture of
these tools, up-to-date technology (computer assisted electro-chemical
milling) will be purchased from the West, together with close-
tolerance presses, plastic moulding machines, heat-treating installa-
tions, and somne machine tools. The gradual implementation would
require about 3 years. The total cost of the project is Ft 232
million ($5.5 million); the required convertible currency foreign
exchange of up to $3.51 million (Ft 140 million, or 49%), including
additional working capital needs ranging between US$690,000 and $1.5
million, will be provided from the LaRD line of credit; the financial
situation of the company allows it to contribute the required 25% to
total financing, and the NBH would provide the balance (Ft 34
million).
(c) The Benefits: The installation of modern technology is essential for
the company to .emain competitive and innovative, and to be able to
produce the new range of minLature accessories for the electronic
industry. As a result of the project, annual sales will increase by
Ft 265 million ($6.3 million) when all equipment is installed and in
full operation from 1987 onwards, and annual profits before taxes
will be increased by Ft 55 million ($1.3 million). Under the most
pessimistic assuimptions, the FRR has been calculated as 19%, and the
ERR as 28%.
2.07     Vpjesti Gepelemgyar (Hydraulic Cylinders), Budapest
(a)  The Company is a well-established company producing shock absorbers,
pneumatic brakes and hydraulic cylinders for the motor vehicle and
agricultural equipment industries. Hydraulic cylinders represent
about 11% of the quantity of products, but accounted for about 45% of
the company's total sales of Ft 452 million ($11.3 million) in 1982.
The products are manufactured under foreign licenses or with foreign
know-how, and are used domestically, exported as such, or incor-
porated in exported vehicles and equipment. Total employment is
about 725; net fixed assets totalled Ft 180 million (US$2.5 million)
by the end of 1982, and net profits (before tax) reached Ft 124
million (US$3.1 million) in 1982. The financial situation of the
company is satisfactory.



- 98 -                   Appendix IV
Page 15 of 16
(b)  The Project:  The company has a stable growing market, particularly
for hydraulic cylinders which are background industries products used
by a number of customers; part of the production is exported to
leading Western vehicle manufacturers.  The purpose of the project is
to enable rhe company to meet the increasing demand by debottle-
necking the cylinder boring section, while in addition new technology
will allow the introduction of a new range of cylinders with opera-
ting pressures up to 330 bars (as compared L'o 160 bars for existing
products); such a technological upgrading is necessary to maintain
markets (and supplements the production program of another credit-
package subproject, Mezogep Monor which produces hydraulic pumps).
The project involves installation of one new special purpose cylinder
boring and finishing machine, and one special machine for polishing
piston rods; both critical operations govern product quality and
production volume. The total project cost is estimated at Ft 26.5
million ($0.66 million), of which 50% or Ft 13.6 million ($0.36
million) will be required from the IBRD loan for imported machinery
(N.C. machine tools) and Ft 13.0 million (49%) will be contributed by
the company.  The implementation time is three to six months,
depending on delivery of the special-purpose machines.
Cc)  The Benefits:  The new technology is essential for the company to
maintain its share in the increasingly sophisticated market for
hydraulic power cylinders, which requires better finishes on the
operating parts to contain the higher pressures now required. Sales
will increase as a result of the implementation of the project by an
estimated Ft 30 million in 1984, Ft 50 million in 1985, and will
reach Ft 60 million at full capacity in 1986; by then, one-third of
the additional production is projected to be exported. Profits
before taxes will increase during the same period from Ft 6 million
in 1984 to Ft 13 million ($0.3 million) per year from 1986 onwards.
The FRR has been calculated to be at least 44%, and the ERR at least
41%.
2.08     Mezogep Monor (Hydraulic Pumps) - Budapest
(a) The Company, Mezogep Honor, operates factories in five locations, and
produces hydraulic pumps and motors, small electric motors, and
forged articles, mainly for the domestic automotive, machine tool,
and agricultural machinery industries. Total sales in 1982 were Ft
1,077 million ($27 million), of which Ft 196 million ($4.9 million or
18%) was hydraulic equipment produced at the Budapest plant, inclu-
ding 30,000 gear pumps with a sales value of Ft 75 million. Total
employment of Mezogep Nonor is 1,750, of which 550 work in the
Budapest hydraulic equipment plant. The financial situation of the
company is satisfactory; net fixed assets totalled Ft 360 million
(US$9 million) by end of 1982, and its profits before tax reached Ft
90 million (US$2.25 million) in 1982.

(b)  The Project:  The domestic production of hydraulic geaT pumps, whicb
are background industries products used for automotive and agricul-
tural auxiliary equipment, satisfies only half the requirements; this
is due to production limitations in part influenced by outdated
equipment not capable of prodLicing punrps at the now required
pressures of 200-250 bars (present rarnge. of Mezogep otonor pump is up
to 160 bars) and in part by the gratdual loss of most skilled labor,
The project will permit to manufacture an additional number of 25,000
higher-pressure hydrauli'c pumps to be used by some 10 companies and
representing half of the projected shortfall in high performance
pumps; it is expected to increase the sales figures of pumps from Pt
75 million/year to Ft 138 million/year.  The pumps wil1 be produced
under a licenses from the Federal kepublic of Germany.  ?he total
project investment cost is Ft 83 million ($2.0 taillion), of which Ft
38 million ($0.95 million) in foreign exchange viLl be from the IBRD
line of credit (45%), Ft 24 rnillion (30Z) from the Vational Bank cf
Hungary, and Ft 21 million (25%) from the company's funds.  The total
foreign exchange cost is represented by tte import cost of precision
N.C. and CNC machine tools from the West for gear generation, gear
grinding, fine boring and honing.  Domestic and East bloc currency
costs cover auxiliary equipment including a hardening plant, building
alteration, and installation costs.  The impLexientation time is
estimated at 30 months, dictated by the delivery time of equiprent
and the need to continue operations while the project is being
implemented.
(c)  The Benefits:  Tie project will increase the company's sales by Ft 55
million in 1986 (start-up), and by Ft 63 million (US$1.50 million)
per year when in full production from 1987 onwards.  The incremental
profit at full production before taxes wiLl be Ft 9.1 million ($0.22
million) per year.  The FRR has been calculated at 137%; the ERR,
based on international prices which are 25 to 90% higher than
domestic prices, ranges between 23% and 30%. This background
industries project supplements the Upjesti hydraulic cylinder project
also being financed under the credit package of the proposed IBRD
line of credit.
