MIEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRE:SIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE   E   DUCECIORS
ON A PROPOSEID CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF HAITI
FOR A ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed Development credit to the Republic of Haiti for SDR 34.6 million (about
US$50.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, to help finance a
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Program. The project would be co-financed with
US$70 million of soft loans and grant funds from the Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB), the European Union (EU) and the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (RFW) of
Germany.
2           Background. The dramatic deterioration of Haiti's economic and social
conditions following the political stalemate in September 1991, and the ensuing financial and
trade embargo accentuated the downward economic and social trends of the 1980s. The
decline in per capita gross national product, recorded at 2% per year during the 1980 to 1991
period, has worsened to around 10% per year since then, resulting in a GDP per capita of
about US$250, making Haiti by far the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
Inflation increased rapidly, from 10 percent during 1991 to an estimated 52 percent by 1994.
Fiscal performance also deteriorated, mainly due to a sharp fall in tax revenues, combined
with some increases in the wage bill due to increased public employment. The overall deficit
of the Central Government increased from less than 1 percent of GDP in 1991 to almost 5
percent of GDP in 1994. Haiti's international trade has been severely affected by the
embargo. The country's external current account deficit, grants excluded, increased from 4
percent of GDP in 1991 to over 7 percent in 1994. The health and nutritional status of the
Haitian population has also worsened significantly since 1991. The Govemment faces the
formidable challenge posed by debilitated institutions, strong macroeconomic imbalances,
dilapidated infrastructure, depleted productive assets, falling social indicators and pervasive
poverty.
3           To address this economic and social situation, the Government of Haiti has
developed a US$402 million emergency economic recovery program (EERP), with the
assistance of a Multilateral Joint Mission, aimed at undertaking prompt and concrete actions
in all sectors to respond to the current situation. In addition to actions in the economic and
social sectors, the program emphasizes introducing and implementing a new philosophy of
governance that would shift the government's role from operating productive assets, directing
industry and economic processes to that of monitoring, regulating, setting policy and
standards and creating enabling conditions for economic development. The sustainability of
the programn's results would depend upon complementary medium and long term investments
and policy reforms to be undertaken by the Government. Restoring and improving the



-2-
country's infrastructure, currently a major bottleneck to any economic development, is one of
the priority actions.
4           Haiti's transport infrastructure is in a generally deplorable state and will
require a major effort to rehabilitate and maintain it. The system, which consists of about
4500 lan of roads, 40 km of privately-owned railway for transporting sugarcane. two
international ports, ten cabotage ports and 40 mooring points and two international airports
and five domestic airfields, has suffered from a decade of maintenance neglect. For
example, less than 7 % of the main road network is in good condition, and most of the rural
road network is in extremely poor condition. The Port-au-Prince streets are also acutely
congested due to deteriorated infiastructure and poor traffic management, leading to high
vehicle operating costs and transit times. The system, moreover, provides inadequate access
to some important rural areas.
5           The existing policies and arrangements for sector management are adequate,
except that the Government needs to: (i) strengthen the enforcement of technical regulations;
(ii) transfer the jurisdiction for two public agencies, the National Port Authority and the
Road Traffic Directorate, to the Ministry of Public Works, Ihnsport and Communications
(MTPIC); and (iii) shift MTP`I's role for roads to the normative one of planning,
regulating and managing the roads sub-sector. The existing transport sector policy allows
transport operators, almost all of whom are private, to work in a free market environment.
The Govenmuent only sets road taxes, establishes safety standards and controls axle loads.
6           MTPTC is responsible for the overall planning, coordination and regulation of
the transport sector and has jurisdiction over all public transport agencies, except the
National Port Authority, which reports to the Ministry of Finance, and the Road Vehicle
Traffic Control Service, which is a branch of the Pblice. These latter agencies should be
transferred to MTPT to permit better coordination with the rest of the sector.
7           MTPTC has been carrying out most of its maintenance by force account, a
role in which it has proved totally inefficient. In line with the new philosophy of governance,
MNPTC's direct operational role should be gradually phased out and tumned over to the
private sector and local communities. Such a shift is feasible since the capacity of the private
construction sector has developed substantially over the past seven years and road
maintenance by local communities has proved successful in Haiti both in work effectiveness
and in helping to solve the high unemployment problem. Because the shift will take time to
accomplish, the contracts for the roads to be rehabilitated during the first two years of the
project, which are also the most important roads, will include maintenance of those roads for
three years after the rehabilitation works are completed. The more difficult issue would be
reducing the staffing of MTPIC to reflect the proposed shift of work to the private sector. In
this regard, there is reason to be hopeful since the Goverrnent had, beFore September 1991,
started a major reorganization of MTPIC including closing down inefficient departnents



- 3 -
altogether, tightening up financial and procurement procedures, and rducing excess
personnel through tight controls. The Government intends to continue this trend.
8           The Govemment needs to introduce an adequate. timely and reliable
mechanism of financing road maintentance to arrest further deterioration of roads, ensure the
sustainability of the proposed costly road improvement and rehabilitation investments and
break the vicious cycle of investment followed by inadequate maintenance leading to the need
for rehabilitation/reconstruction which is again followed by inadequate maintenance and then
more investment. Secure and reliable maintenance funding would also be a crucial factor in
encouraging the proposed private sector participation in maintenance. The Governtnent has
consistently spent less than 20% of the amnounts required for adequate maintenance. The
Government has agreed to undertake a study, as part of the proposed project, on feasible
road maintenance financing mechanisms and to implement the recommendations. Before such
mechanisms are established, however, the Government will continue to need external support
to finance its road maintenance programs.
9           The major problems requiring the Govemment's attention, therefore, include:
(i) rehabilitating urgently its dilapidated road network; (ii) reorganizing MTPIC to
effectively carry out its sector management functions and to shift its role from that of a direct
executor of works to the normative one of planning, regulating and supervising; (iii)
increasing the participation of the private sector and village communities in carrying out
maintenance works; and (iv) establishing a reliable and adequate funding mechanism for road
maintenance.
10    Project Objectives. The project is designed to help address the above needs and
problems. Its objectives are to: (i) assist the Government in implementing a comprehensive
five-year road maintenance and rehabilitation program on the intercity road network and in
Port-au-Prince; (ii) strengthen road sub-sector management within a comprehensive
restructuring program of the MTPTC; (ili) foster private sector and community participation
in road works; and (iv) assist the Government in increasing its financing of road maintenance
over time.
11    Project Description. The project, which would help finance MTPTC's five-year
road program, would comprise: (i) bridge and road rehabilitation works to be contracted out
(about US$77.3 million); (ii) periodic and routine maintenance works to be carried out by
local firns, village and urban communities and MITPTC force account where necessary
(about US$25 million); (iii) limited procurement of traffic control and maintenance
equipment and tools (about US$2.2 million); and (iv) an institutional strengthening
component (about US$17.3 million) aimed at: (i) restructuring the MTPIC; (ii) improving
transport planning and sector policy; (iii) training MTPTC staff to prepare projects for
private sector implementation and to manage contracts; and (iv) preparing studies aimed at
resolving sector/sub-sector issues. The project would also refinance a PPF advance granted in



- 4 -
early 1991 (US$0.8 million), and would include a provision for financial charges on the IDB
credit, in line with that agency's practice (US$2.4 million).
12    Project Costs and Financing Plan. The project is estimated to cost about US$125
million, including contingencies. The Government would finance US$5 million, the IDB
US$45 million, including US$2.4 million of financial charges, the EU US$20 million, KFW
US$5.0 million and IDA US$50 million. Extemal agencies would mostly finance works by
contract, equipment and technical assistance, and the Government all the works by force
account. In view of the Government's severe financial constraints, the proposed project
would include external financing of part of the local costs, including maintenance, on a
declining basis. IDA funds would not finance salaries and wages. Local cost financing in the
program's initial stages is needed to: (i) restart the Government's maintenance efforts; and
(ii) support the introduction of new labor-intensive techniques and promote the participation
of small contractors and local communities. The cost table and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Haiti are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13489-HA, dated February 28, 1995 is also
attached.
13    Project Implementation. Implementation of the project is expected to take six years
starning May 1995. The project would be carried out by MTPTC through: (i) a new
integrated Road Directorate for the intercity network; (ii) a new Central Urban Directorate
for the works in Pbrt-au-Prince; and (iii) the Transport Directorate for the transport studies.
Before this new organization is ratified by the Assembly, the project would be carried out
through a Coordinating Unit (CU) under the responsibility of the General Director of
MTPlT to coordinate project implementation activities, including procurement, project
financial accounting and preparation of project reports. The CU would consist of an
experienced coordinator, an institutional specialist, an accountant and an expert to be
responsible for technical assistance activities. MTPdC's personnel would be supported also
by two teams of expatriate consultants, one for the intercity works and the other for the
urban works. The consultants' participation would be gradually reduced as MTPTC's staff
gain proficiency. The consultants' positions to be discontinued would be decided during
annual project impiementation reviews. A professional procurement firm/agency would be
hired under the project to assist directly with all stages of bidding and with the review of
payments for works.
14    The subprojects to be implemented during 1995 were agreed at negotiations. The
subprojects to be executed each year after 1995 would be selected by June 30 of the year
preceding the year of implementation based upon economic, technical, financial and
environmental criteria satisfactory to the Association as well as on forecasts on MTPIC's
implementation capacity based on the previous year's performance. All subprojects selected
for implementation would have a positive NPV, a Benefit-Cost ratio more than I and an



- 5 -
economic rate of return (ERR) of at least 12%. Annual review meetings would be held in
July 31 of each year to review implementation progress and agree on corrective actions. All
rehabilitation works and about 80% of maintenance would be carried out by contracts with
private enterprises and local communities and the remaining 20% of maintenance under
quasi-contracts with MTPIC's regional departments for works by force account. A
consulting teain would assist the Ministry's personnel in supervising all maintenance works;
supervision of rehabilitation works would also be contracted out. Because of the weak
implementation capacity of MTPTC, the project provides also for short-term consulting
services to provide specialized assistance, as needed, during implementation. The Bank
Group's standard documents would be used for procurement of all civil works and goods and
the engagement of consultants financed by IDA. All the works and contracts to be financed
by various donors would be financed on a parallel basis. The Government's 4% contribution
to the program would serve as counterpart funds; it would be fully documented and
monitored as an integral part of the project.
15    Project Sustainability. The project's focus on shifting road maintenance from force
account to contract maintenance and the expected improvement in maintenance financing
through establishing a more reliable funding mechanism, would ensure the sustainability of
the road restoration works to be undertaken under the project.
16    Lessons Learned. The Bank Group has played a significant role in the development
of Haiti's transport sector with seven loans, mainly for roads but with ports and coastal
shipping components. The projects have generally achieved their principal objectives.
Physical implementation was in all cases delayed, however, because of lack of counterpart
funds, the inadequate capacity of MTPTC and, more recently, political instability. The PCRs
for the completed projects recommend that new projects in the sector should: (i) have simple
objectives and design; (ii) focus on institution building, especially MTPTC's future role in
road maintenance; (iii) be integrated into MTPIC's overall road prograam to better recognize
the financial constraints; and (iv) have a flexible project design, coupled with tight project
supervision, to adapt the project and the pace of implementation to changing circumstances.
The design of the proposed project reflects all the above recommendations.
17   Rationale for IDA Involvement. For the next twelve to eighteen months, IDA  s
assistance strategy for Haiti aims to support the Government in: (i) providing basic goods
and services to meet urgent needs; (ii) rehabilitating priority social and economic
infrastructure; (iii) establishing the context for an adequate macroeconomic and incentive
framework; (iv) initiating medium-term reforms with emphasis on public-sector
modernization, poverty alleviation and environmental restoration; and (v) coordinating the
efforts of the intemational donor community to ensure adequate financing with an appropriate
focus on Haiti's priority needs.
18    To implement this strategy and in support of the Government's EERP, IDA is: (i)
providing financing for critical imports through an Emergency Economic Recovery Credit of



- 6 -
SDR26.8 million (US$40 million) approved by the Board on December 20, 1994 (co-
financed with the IDB); (ii) reactivating its ongoing portfolio, which comprises over US$104
million of undisbursed funds in six projects (five ongoing projects are in the process of
resuming implementation; a sixth is being reviewed at this time); (iii) pursuing an intensive
policy dialogue and beginning preparation of a proposed Structural Adjustment Credit,
scheduled for FY96; (iv) leading the preparation of a comprehensive Ptverty Assessment for
Haiti and initiating development of poverty-related investment lending operations; and (v)
coordinating doner support for Haiti, through the Consultative Group and other mechanisms.
VWork is also under way on a Country Assistance Strat_gy, expected to be presented to the
Board early in FY96.
19    The project is consistent with the assistance strategy framework outlined above. The
emphasis in most future IDA investment lending will be on human resources, rural
development and related environmental issues, with the IDB playing a relatively greater role
in infrastructure development. IDA's cofinancing of this operation is justified as part of a
multi-donor effort to support and provide a basis for sustaining the economic and social
i-mprovements expected fr'm the economic recovery program by: (i) rehabilitating transpo,t
infrastructure facilities an%i arresting their continued decline which would otherwise be a
major bottleneck for economic recovery; (ii) helping to modernize and improve the
Government's efficiency through shifting its role from operator and manager to regulator in
the roads sub-sector; and (iii) helping to alleviate poverty by providing employment through
contracting out and community participation in executing road works under the project.
20    Agreements Reached. The proposed project, which aims at major shifts in
MTITC's role and improvement in its performance, would be implemented in a difficult
social and economic period for Haiti in addition to MTP'IC's inadequate absorptive capacity.
Therefore, besides providing consultants' assistance to bolster the Ministry's capacity, the
project has been designed to provide a flexible framework to deal with that situation. In
particular, approval of each year's rehabilitation program would be linked to the actual
implementation performance of the previous year's program and to progress on an action
plan on key sector and institutional issues, to adapt project implementation to the actual
capacity of the Ministry and to enable a continuous dialogue with the Ministry on the
progress of the maintenance effort.
21    The specific project conditionalities and the scope of the action plan are given in
Attachment 1 (agreements reached) and Attachment 2 (action plan on the conditions for
approval of the annual rehabilitation programs). Both the project agreements and the action
plan cover the following areas: (i) five-year road program updated annually; (ii) restructuring
plan of the Ministry and detailed arrangements on the road departments and for the proposed
Environmental Division; (iii) detailed annual budgets for road maintenance and actions on the
establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund; (iv) sector policy framework, including TORs
for studies, review of sector investments, and schedule for implementation of actions; and (v)
derailed arrangements for project execution. Most of the institutional development and policy



-7-
reform actions have been scheduled for the latter years of implementation because of the
fragile political situation in the country.
22    Environmental Aspects. An IDB environmental assessment of MTPTC's road
program, of which the project is a part, concluded that: (i) the programn's overall
environmental impact would be positive in addressing past environmental problems caused by
flaulty road design and construction by upgrading drainage structures; (ii) the increased
pressure on natural resources resulting indirectly from improved transport should be minimal
since the road program includes only the currently most traveled roads; and (iii) bidding
documents for project works should include mitigatory measures for possible negative
environmental impacts from roadwork activities such as quarrying, opening of borrow pits,
disposal of used road materials and temporary work camps. The project's roads and streets
would be subjected to environmental studies and mitigatory actions agreed between IDA and
the Govemment before roadworks are started. Also, bidding documents for the project's
works would include adequate specifications to cover the measures under (iii) above. An
Environmental Ministry has recently been created in Haiti to serve all sectors of the
economy. In order to improve MTPIC's overall management of the environnental impacts
elated to its activities, the Ministry has agreed to establish an Environmental Unit. The Unit
will help with environmental impact evaluation and monitoring. The Unit's effectiveness will
be reviewed at the annual meetings on the project's performance. The project has a "B"
environmental rating.
23    Program Objective Categories. This operation is not part of IDA's program of
targeted interventions. Nonetheless, it is expected that over 80% of the project's benefits
would accrue to low-income individuals. Moreover, individuals from low income
communities would benefit directly from their employment under the contracting out and
coi.amunity-based road maintenance under the project.
24    Benefits. Improvement of road maintenance and rehabilitation of the main road
network would facilitate transport of goods and people countrywide and would preserve a
large part of the country's road infrastructure. Project benefits are expected to be substantial
in terms of reduced transport costs, induced economic activity, increased employment
through the development of labor-intensive activities, and the positive impact on the poor
through the re-establishment of regular access to markets and social services. ERRs on the
rehabilitation investments average over 60% on the intercity network, and over 40% in Port-
au-Prince, due to high traffic on the ro ds selected in the program and overdue maintenance.
The ERRs for all subprojects exceed II%. The institutional restructuring program of the
Ministry, together with improved mechanisms for road maintenance funding, should also
ensure that the investments being financed by the project are sustainable. The NPV of the
proposed road rehabilitation component (intercity and Port-au-Prince) is estimated at
US$153.2 million at a discount rate of 12% with an overall Benefit-Cost ratio of 3.5.

25    Risks. The project's investment components are relatively simple froin an
engineering point of view and with thie technical assistance to be provided for implementation
should not involve substantial risks. The project's instituticnal and-' policy refonn objectives
are, however, ambitious as they involve a substantial shift in road maintenance practices,
management and financing. This will take time and, hence, they are scheduied tor
achievement during the second half of the implementation period. The eventual success of the
program depends on the sustained commitment of the Government to increase private and
community participation in the program and to provide appropriate maintenance funding.
Possible project risks therefore include: (i) implementation delays and cost overruns, at least
initially; (ii) insufficient budgetary allocations and payment delays which might reduce
private sector interest in the program; and (iii) slow progress on the institutional program and
action plan. These risks are believed to be manageable through: (i) the flexible design of the
project linking annual work programs to the actual implementation capacity of the Ministry;
(ii) the growing interest and capacity of the local private sector, as already tested in a pilot
operation; (iii) the permanent financing arrangements proposed, which should lead to
increased local pressure for road financing; and (iv) the project arrangements linking
approval of the annual rehabilitation programs to progress on the action plan. Additionally,
intensive supervision by IDA, IDB, t':le EU and KfW would be required, especially during
the annual reviews and in the early stages of project implementation.
26    Recominendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
