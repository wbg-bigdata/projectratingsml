BRAZIL
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO PORTOBRAS S. A.
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.             The following report on a proposed Technical Assistance Loan to
PORTOBRAS S.A., Brazil, for US$20.0 million equivalent, is submitted for approv-
al.  The proposed loan, which would be repaid over 15 years, including 3 years
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and charges, and guaranteed
by the Federative Republic of Brazil, would help to finance operational and insti-
tutional improvements in the port subsector.
2.        Background.  The port system of Brazil includes some 35 key seaports and
a few major river and lake ports. As the bulk of the about US$40 billion annual
Brazilian foreign trade is transported by sea, with exports generally accounting
for over 2/3 of the international traffic, the effective functioning of the port
subsector is vital for the economy. Currently about 325 million tons of cargo are
handled in the ports annually, and overall port traff'c is forecast to increase at
an average rate of 5% p.a. in the medium term. This growth will be characterized
by the rapid penetration of zontainerization and will require substantial invest-
ments to expand and modernize port facilities.
3.        PORTOBRAS, S.A. (the National Port Authority) a public enterprise under
the J',risdiction of the Ministry of Transport, is responsible for the overall
administration of ports and waterways, including policy formulation, planning,
tariff administration, coordination, and the control of investments and finances.
The ports, except for a few privately owned terminals, are operated by: (i) mixed
economy companies, in which the Federal Government through PORTOBRAS, owns a
majority of the equity; (ii) by State Government Agencies or private companies,
under concession from PORTOBRAS; and (iii) directly by PORTOBRAS. The institu-
tional capabilities of PORTOBRAS need strengthening if it is to provide direction
for the subsector and develop a concerted national strategy, as well as management
and administrative arrangements to respond to the evolving economic trends in
international trade and the maritime industries.   PORTOBRAS is a large and (in
many areas) inefficient organization. There is excessive centralization of deci-
sion making, and a tendency to give more attentiLn to the achievement of invest-
ment targets than to sound operational, economic and financial planning.
Planning, budgeting and costing are weak, and do not facilitate commercially
oriented performance and cost control.   Tariff structures are antiquated, not
related to current cost and market conditions, and there is substantial room for
higher productivity through improved labor practices. Information systems are not
adequate for effective control and management of port operations.  In addition,
there is a shortage of facilities and equipment for hydraulic research and, there-
fore, important base elements are lacking for designing maritime strutctures and
for dredging and river training.   Investigations often yield only conjectural
rather than statistical information for decision making.   These inefficiencies
ultimately hamper the competitiveness of Brazilian exports and jeopardize efforts
to increase the country's foreign exchange earnings.



-2-
4.           To overcome the problems and to ensure efficient management of the
expected traffic growth and the expansion program that will be necessary to accom-
modate it, substantial institutional, financial and operational improvements will
be necessary.  In recognition of this, the Government's specific objectives for
the port subsector call for: (i) the gradual achievement of financial self-suffi-
ciency; (ii) the introduction of a realistic tariff policy to ensure the recovery
of appropriate costs for specific services; (Wi) higher productivity through
improved port operation; (iv) streamlined organization with rationalized adminis-
trative practices; (v) appropriate investment and operational planning with
priority given to specialized terminal operations; (vi) improved human-resource
administration; and (vii) appropriate interfacing with other modes of transport.
5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategic objective is to
support  programs  that  contribute  to  macroeconomic  adjustments  and  economic
growth. In particular, Bank lending seeks to promote exports, increase domestic
resource mobilization and improve the efficiency of the public sector and the
proposed project is fully in line with these objectives.   The Brazilian port
subsector has evolved into a bureaucratic and often inefficient system, and
without substantial policy and institutional reforms it will not be able to
achieve its full potential as an efficient conduit for international trade. With
the proposed project, in addition to providing scarce financial resources, the
Bank, through advice and guidance and through its greater access to international
experience and expertise, would provide critical support to develop and implement
high priority action programs for policy and institutional reforms.
6.        Project Objectives.  The project aims generally to make the port system
a more effective operation and in particular to contribute to more efficient
resource use and to the improved utilization of Brazil's port capacity within the
context of the Government's objecti' s and integrated strategy for the transport
sector. The project would support institutional and operational programs to: (i)
establish a sound basis for developing and managing the national port system,
consistent with current and anticipated developments in trade markets and the
transport industry; (ii) enhance the efficiency of port operations; (iii)
strengthen the management and coordination capacity of PORTOBRAS, (iv) improve the
commercial performance of individual port companies; (v) facilitate intermodal
transport processes, and (vi) reduce the port system's dependency on government
subsidies.
7.         Project Description.  The project would consist of: (a) an institution
building component with about 1,050 man-months of consultancy assistance for:
(i) streamlining the subsector organization and financing; (ii) port system
development and improved planning and management; (iii) streamlining PORTOBRAS'
organization, management and information systems; (iv) improved operational
practices for better productivity; (v) improved cost, budgetary and tariff systems
to respond to the needs of a commercially oriented port organization; and (vi)
advanced in-service training to support the implementation of the improvement
programs (34% of total project cost); (b) assistance to upgrade the research and
operational capacity of the National Hydraulics Research Institute (INPE, a
department of PORTOBRAS) through the purchase of highly specialized equipment,
software for and training in mathematical modelling and through some civil works
for scale models and to accommodate the expanded research facilities (37%); and
(c) engineering and preparation of bid documents for high priority projects to be
identified as part of improving investment planning in line with the objectives



-3-
and strategies for the development of the port subsector (29%). A number of the
improvement piograms developed under the project would be implemented immediately
in areas such as port operatlons (including installation of an equipment mainte-
nance system and streamlined labor scheduling and cargo handling practices),
improvements in the planning of investments and general operations, management
information and budgetary and cost control systems, tariff design and training
programs.
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$44.0 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of about US$14.7 million (33%).  The proposed
loan of US$20 million would finance the estimated foreign exchange cost and 18% of
the local costs. The project would be implemented over 6-1/2 years by PORTOBRAS
in close cooperation with the major ports.  To coordinate and direct implementa-
tion, PORTOBRAS has already established a Project Management Unit headed by a
suitably qualified Project Coordinator. To accelerate implementation, retroactive
financing of up to US$1 million would be available to meet costs incurred after
appraisal (June 1987) mainly for technology transfer in the areas of planning and
port operation. A breakdown of costs and the financial plan are shown In Schedule
A; amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as a disbursement
schedule, are shown i.x Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank group operations in Brazll are given in Schedules C and D
respectively.   The attached Technical Annex provides detailed information about
the project, with a Schedule showing the key project implementation activities.
9.           Agreed Actions.   It was agreed that PORTOBRAS will: (i) maintain a
Project Management Unit headed by a Project Coordinator with adequate qualifica-
tions and experience; (ii) maintain a revolving account in cruzados with funds
available to meet in timely manner the scheduled requirements of the project;
(iii) undertake key project activities, including those for employment of experts
and for the implementation of the recommendations as agreed by PORTOBRAS, the
Government and the Bank for the improvement programs in accordance with an agreed
timetable; and (iv) commence selection of investment projects for engineering
studies by April 30, 1989 and, subject to the Bank's approval of the selected
projects, begin the studies by September 30, 1989.  Prior to loan effectiveness:
(a) PORTOBRAS will: (i) establish, satisfactory to the Bank, separate accounting
system for the Project; (ii) establish the cruzado revolviag  account in form and
substance satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) prepare a cash-flow analysis for the
Project, satisfactory to the Government and the Bank; and (b) adequate provision
will be made in the Government's 1E88 budget for the Project.
10.        Benefits.  The proposed project would help to rationalize the port sub-
sector's organization, screngthen its management, introduce more cost effective,
modern operational practices, and improve the utilization of the productive
capacity of the port system, thus enhancing the competitiveness of the Brazilian
exports. The institutional and operational improvements would lead to more effi-
cient operation, strengthening the financial capacity of the sector, and reducing
its need for public funds.   These improvements would be the first step in a
process to be supported through a proposed sector operation that would thoroughly
restructure the port subsector, and integrate subsector policies with an overall
national transport sector strategy.

11.       Risks.  The main risk would be the possible delay of studies and imple-
mentation of their recommendations due to lack of counterpart funds, resistance to
accepting and implementing the studies' recommendations and due to   changing
Government priorities.   The loan conditions for a phased implementation program
and the provisions for securing the availability of counterpart funding, together
with Bank supervision which would be more intensive than for a similar sized
investment project, should substantially mitigate these risks.
12.         Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

Technical Annex to the Memorandum of the President
for a
Port Technical Assistance Project
A. The Project and its Background
I.     Sector Overview, Objectives and Strategy.
1.         The transport sector of Brazil developed considerably during the period
of rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s.  Transport output consistently
increased at annual rates of about 10%, with freight traffic increasing at over 8%
and inter-city passenger traffic at about 13%.  The Federal government and some
richer states have invested heavily in transport infrastructure, initially in an
extensive network of interstate and primary highways.  After the 1973 oil shock,
federal investment priorities were shifted toward the railways and specialized
port terminals to support the expansion of the steel industry and the growing
mineral and agricultural exports. With the economic recession in the early 1980,
public investments were drastically scaled down, completion of several new con-
struction projects was postponed, and emphasis was gradually placed on the reha-
bilitation of existing facilities. However, the Government's austerity program as
well as the containment of the tariffs and rates of the public enterprises, led to.
the postponement of needed maintenance and rehabilitation works sectorwide, and to
the deterioration of substantial parts of the transport system.   The economic
recovery which started in mid-1984 and the resulting resumption of rapid traffic
growth rates are now putting increasing strains on many parts of the transport
system.
2.        Traffic allocation is broadly in line with the comparative efficiency of
the various modes.   Road transport is dominant for domestic trade, it carries
about 60% of total freight and 97% of inter-city passengers and the railways carry
23% of the freight.   Inland water transport, although not very significant coun-
trywide, is gaining importance in the Amazon Basin and in the Rio Grande export
corridor.   Coastal shipping, virtually stagnant before, began to grow at annual
rates of about 8% during the last 10 years.   Maritime transport is extremely
important, it accommodates the bulk of the country's external trade.   There is
significant potential for increasing the efficiency of trade related physical
distribution networks through enhanced intermodal coordination. This particularly
applies to key transport corridors where such improvements could be achieved
through further specialization of the railways, and to some extent, of the coastal
shipping and inland water transport, aided by streamlined interfacing between
public enterprises, private carriers and shippers.
3.          The sector is managed by large subsectoral "autonomous" agencies and
public enterprises under the jurisdiction of the Federal Ministry of Transport or
of the State Governments. The operating and financial performance of these public
enterprises has generally been poor.  Their centrally controlled tariffs have in
general been adjusted in line with inflation but have remained well below costs,
and the Government, particularly for railways and rail mass transit systems, has



- 13 -
had to cover substantial operating deficita. Investment or operational decisions
have often been made at the Government level, without taking full account of the
enterprise's priorities and/or fund-generating capacities, and without commercial
considerations. The lack of clear definition of the respective responsibilities
of the Government and the enterprises, the lack of appropriate management autonomy
and accountability, and the lack of continuity in the companies' mat1agement and
strategies have also resulted in considerable operational inefficiencies.
4.        Tne Government's objectives and strategy for the transport sector, which
are in line with the principles advocated by the Bank, aim to support the broader
objectives to achieve the necessary adjustments and sustain the economic growth.
They include: (i) operational and financial rehabilitation of the sector's public
enterprises and the establishment of a policy and institutional framework condu-
cive to market-driven operations and effective management; (ii) reorganization of
the highway subsector, strengthening the management of the highway agencies and
the funding system, and aiming to improve network maintenance; (iii) better inter-
modal coordination, including the development of the more efficient multimodal
transport alternatives in the main transport corridors; and (iv) rehabilitation
and maintenance of existing facilities as a priority over new construction. For
the port subsector, the Government's specific objectives are:   (i) the gradual
achievement of financial self-sufficiency; (ii) introduction of realistic tariff
policy for appropriate cost recoveries, (iii) higher productivity through improved
port operation; (iv) streamlined organization with rationalized administrative
practices; (v) appropriate investment and operational planning with due priorities
given to specialized terminal operations; (vi) gradual reduction of reliance upon
Treasury Funds; (vii) improved human resource administration; and (viii) appro-
priate interfacing with other modes of transport.
5.        The Bank has made seven loans for highways, three for feeder roads, four
for railways and one for ports, in additioli to financing the construction of an
890 km railway under the Carajas Iron Ore project and a 27 km rail mass transit
system in Porto Alegre. The projects, until 1975 concentrated on the expansion of
facilities; emphasis in subsequent loans gradually shifted to maintenance and
rehabilitation. More recently, with the rapid deterioration of the financial and
operational performance of the sector, the policy and institutional reforms advoc-
ated by the Bank for more efficient resource use and for management effectiveness
have received broader considerations (Transport Sector Review Strategy Paper, No.
5721-BR, June 1985). In support of the financial rehabilitation and the commer-
cially oriented operation of the public enterprises, as well as improved manage-
ment of the highway subsector, the Bank approved a Federal Railway-Export
Corridor-Project in 1985, the FEPASA Railway Rehabilitation and Sao Paulo Highway
Management Projects in 1987. This proposed Port Technical Assistance Project, as
a component of this assistance, would be a solid foundation for a follow-up pro-
ject of a broad sectoral nature within the context of an integrated national
transport strategy.
6.          The port system of Brazil includes 35 key seaports, and a few major
river and lake ports.  About 325 million tons of import and export cargoes were
handled in the ports under PORTOBRAS' jurisdiction in 1986 with export represent-
ing about 65% of total cargo movements. A notable recent development is the rapid
penetration of containerization, both in overseas and domestic trades. Since 1980
the volume of containerized cargo has increased by over 300% and substantial and
continued growth can be anticipated.  Containerized cargoes oresently account for



- 14 -
only 20% of total general  cargo traffic whereas a much higher, percentage of
Brazil's traded commodities is containerizable.   Also the main shipping lines
serving Brazilian markets expect to introduce more container carrying capacity
into their fleets.  Port investments, which In the last decade, have focused on
the construction of specialized terminals and on renewal of port equipment, now
are limited to the completion of a specialized terminal and to a number of minor
port rehabilitation and waterway maintenance projects.  The four-year investment
program (1988-1991, yet to be approved by the Government) includes about US$600
million, with the major expenditures earmarked for expanding installattons to
handle dry-bulk cargo and general cargo, largely containerized.   Resource cons-
traints are expected to result in approval of a smaller program.
7.        PORTOBRAS, S.A., a public company under the jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Transport, is responsible for the overall administration of the ports and
inland waterways including planning, tariff administration, coordination and
control of investment and finances, and for assisting the Government in formulat-
ing policies for these areas.   The ports, except for privately owned terminals,
are managed and controlled to various degrees by PORTOBRAS.   They are operated:
(i) by mixed economy companies, in which the Federal Government, through
PORTOBRAS, owns at least 51% (generally over 90%) of the equity; (ii) by State
Government Agencies or private companies, under concession from PORTOBRAS; and
(iii) directly by PORTOBRAS.  In general, the ports in the states of Sao Paulo,
Rio de Janeiro and the Northeast are organized as mixed economy companies; those
in the southern states  are operated by concessionaires.   PORTOBRAS directly
operates the ports of Manaus and Recife, as well as a few other minor ports. The
organization of PORTOBRAS is shown in Technical Annex, Schedule 1.
II.   The Project
8.        The project with (a) Institution Building; (b) Applied Research; and (c)
Engineering Studies/Bid Document Preparation components has been designed as the
first phase of a broader plan for the institutional and financial restructuring of
the Brazilian ports. It would, with studies and action programs, focus on select-
ed high priority areas and develop the foundation for a full-fledged Port Sector
Loan to be appraised about two years later to support the comprehensive streamlin-
ing of the subsector.  In particular, this proposed project would help to:   (i)
establish a rational basis for developing and managing the national port system,
consistent with actual and anticipated developments in the trade markets and
transport industries; (ii) enhance the efficiency oL port operations; (iii)
strengthen the administrative functions and coordination capacity of PORTOBRAS;
(iv) improve the commercial performance of the port operators; (v) facilitate
intermodal transport processes, and (vi) reduce the port system's dependency on
goverment subsidies. The Bank through its access to international experience and
expertise and through its ability to fulfill a catalytic role, would be able to
provide critical support to most urgently required reforms and to lay the founda-
tion for a more comprehensive subsector operation.
(a) Institution Building Component
9.         The institution building component (US$15 million of which 60% is Bank
financed) would be for formulating and implementing strategies and action programs
with technical assistance (work program and man months requirements are shown in
Technical Annex, Schedule 2), to improve the operational/institutional efficiency
of PORTOBRAS and of the port operators.   The action programs, in line with the
subsector issues would concentrate on the following areas:



- 15 -
(i)   Subsector Organization and Financing.   A strategy and action plan for
the institutional and organizational development of the ports and inland
waterways subsectors would be prepared for the Government's considera-
tion. The plan would be based upon the Government declared policies and
upon the analysis of the major bottlenecks to the efficient development
and effective management of the subsector. The plan would in particular
address: (a) the respective roles of PORTOBRAS, the Federal and the
State Governments, and the port operating companies and agencies regard-
ing the operation, maintenance, management (including environmental
protection) and development of the ports and inland waterways systems,
consistent with Government decentralization objectives; (b) the legal
and organizational framework required for the roles determined in (a)
above, including that of the private sector, consistent with the Govern-
ment's objectives; (c) the financing proposals for investments, opera-
tions and maintenance, defining in particular the respective roles of
port tariffs and the port improvement tax, the port revenue sharing
schemes, and the administration and control of port tariffs. PORTOBRAS
would be responsible for carrying out this work with technical
assistance.
(~ii) Port System Development, Planning and Management. While entrusted with
the task of providing guiding frameworks for the development and manage-
ment of the national port system, PORTOBRAS' capacity to deal with this
mandate has remained limited. As a fundamental shortcoming, there is no
concerted national strategy for developing individual ports and asso-
ciated operational and managemement arrangements to respond to the
evolving trends in the trade markets and maritime industries.  In the
absence of an effective national port development and management strate-
gy, planning of port expansions and operational arrangements are largely
on an ad-hoc basis, resulting in developments and service arrangements
which are often not responsive to market demands, and more importantly,
involve less than optimum resource allocations. These in turn result in
unnecessarily high port costs having negative impacts on trade competi-
tiveness. To remedy the situation, a rational basis for port develop-
ment, including the streamlining of organizational arrangements, func-
tions and processes for PORTOBRAS and for the other port operators would
be established basically through: (a) reviewing ongoing planning studies
and other relevant data and information bases; (b) undertaking necessary
complementary investigations to establish the analytical foundation for
a national port development strategy; (c) formulating a national port
development strategy; (d) designing the required adjustments to existing
port master plans, in line with the strategy, programs and related
feasibility studies for selected key ports. PORTOBRAS would be respon-
sible for carrying out these tasks with technical assistance.
(iii)  PORTOBRAS' Organization, Management and Information System.  PORTOBRAS,
with about 1,000 employees in the Head Office and over 22,000 in the
port system, is a large organization both vertically and horizontally.
Departments and divisions have developed into specialized operations
often functioning in isolation; the communication problem is also
serious.  The lack of clearly defined corporate objectives, performance
incentives, and strategies combined with the excessive centralization of
decision making is generating inefficiences at all levels of the



- 16 -
organization. In addition the lack of appropriate personnel management
tools and systems such as job description, promotion and career plans,
performance planning, monitoring and evaluation of training, do not
permit an appropriate organizational dimensioning or effective personnel
management. Consistent with the Government's objectives, a reorganiza-
tion program will be developed for PORTOBRAS particularly addressing:
(a) PORTOBRAS' organizational structure, with a view to strengthening
its subsector management and coordination functions and delegating port
operational fut.ctions to the port operating companies as appropriate;
(b) work organization, methods and procedures, focussing on the develop-
ment of appropriate job descriptions and manuals of methods and proce-
dures, and on organizational dimensioning; and (c) personnel policies
and management system, in particular formulating appropriate personnel
recruitment, training, promotion and compensation policies, and develop-
ing basic personnel management tools such as career and access planning,
and performance evaluation. Also, on the basis of a review of the data
systems plans of PORTOBRAS and of a few selected port operators: (a) a
strategy and a master plan would be prepared for the development of data
systems in the subsector; and (b) the ports of Santos and Rio would
prepare respective master plans for the development of their own opera-
tions control and port management information systems. The subsector's
strategy and master plan would focus on the definition of the necessary
standards to be used by the port operators in their data systems to
ensure appropriate compatibility and integration of the various systems
consistent with the above-mentioned organization plan.  The Santos and
Rio master plans, on a pilot basie, would include preliminary designs
and feasibility analyses of the port   operations  control and port
management information systems which would be developed and implemented
in the medium term, and would therefore provide necessary inputs for
PORTOBRAS' strategy and master plan. PORTOBRAS, in close coordination
with the ports of Rio and Santos, will be responsible to carry out these
works with technical assistance.
(iv) Operations, Labor Practices. The responsibility for terminal operations
lies primarily with the individual ports, although PORTOBRAS is also
involved, through operating standards, productivity and costing studies,
and through labor agreements. The labor for cargo handling and facility
maintenance is employed through collect've agreements which reflect out-
dated operating practices, largely ignoring modern cargo- and container-
handling methods.  The problems directly related to these labor agree-
ments  are  enormous.    The  inability  to  introduce  modern operating
methods, the unequal and often conflicting incentive schemes negotiated
with labor working on subsequent shifts result in gross inefficiencies,
delays and high costs, making many terminal operations unreliable and
unattractive to shippers, receivers and the shipping lines.  With the
aim to improve productivity, in Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Paranagua, and
in Manaus and Recife, the action programs would assist, inter alia, in
upgrading operating practices including better utilization of facili-
ties, maintenance practices, cargo handling, yard and storage opera-
tions, effective use of labor, improved auxiliary services, cargo clear-
ing services (including administrative procedures) and improved coordi-
nation with other transport modes.  While the programs would focus on
the operation at the above mentioned ports, PORTOBRAS' relevant research



- 17 -
and coordinating role would also he reinforced with the aim to ensure
that all the port entitities would have access to improved operating
practices. PORTOBRAS in close coordination with the ports of Santos,
Rio de Janeiro, Paranagua, Manaus and Recife, would be responsible to
carry out these works with technical assistance.   The needed improve-
ments would have to result in the review of the somewhat archaic port
labor legislation for the purpose of modernization which often prevents
more cost effective utilization of port labor.  This is recognized to be
a highly sensitive and complicated matter where improvements could be
achieved only gradually and in the long run.   However, without the
needed reforms, the port system will not be able to achieve the full
potential benefits of containerization, roll-on/roll-off and other
modern cargo handling methods.
(v)  Financing,  Costing,  Budgeting, and Tariffs.   The port companies in
Brazil rely heavily on Government funds for investments and, particular-
ly in the last few years, for covering their operating deficits and
financial expenses.   The undesirable financial situation is partially
due to Brazil's current economic and fiscal problems, but also to the
following three factors: (a) the current port tariff structure, which is
not cost-bascd, does not provide marketing incentives nor stimulate
operational efficiencies, and it is not conducive to reduce reliance on
Treasury Funds; (b) the revenue and surplus sharing arrangements between
PORTOBRAS and the other port operators do not stimulate the operators'
financial performance; and (c) the existing budgetary system does not
facilitate financial discipline, efficiency and the development of and
adherence to financial targets. Implementation oriented programs would
aim to upgrade the existing systems both in the ports and in PORTOBRAS
as warranted, making them respond to the needs of the ports as commer-
cially oriented providers of port services, to produce and disseminate
information for business decision making such as investment evaluation,
operational decisions and tariff assessments and to provide a basis for
management control, monitoring of financial discipline and operational
performance. While the work, under this project, would focus on the
ports of Santos and Rio de Janeiro, and on the administration of
PORTOBRAS, it is expected that subsequently, the upgraded systems would
be introduced in the entire PORTOBRAS system, with technical assistance
possibly financed from the next Bank loan. The tariff action programs,
with the overall objective to assist the port operators and PORTOBRAS to
gradually achieve financial self-sufficiency, would aim to develop a
cost-based/market oriented tariff structure and levels, better reflect-
ing the cost of services provided. The procedure to review and upgrade
tariffs would be revised and improved in line with a tariff performance
control system.  Similarly, budgeting which does not facilitate finan-
cial discipline, efficiency, and adherence to performance targets would
be upgraded and put on a commercial basis, appropriate for financial
planning, efficient control and utilization of resources, and to ensure
the financially viable operation of the ports. In addition, the revenue
sharing formulas, between PORTOBRAS and the subsidiary and concessionary
port operators which are complicated, and lack incentive elements to
stimulate efficiency would be reviewed. An action program to encourage
more cost effective operation would be developed.   These works, with
technical assistance, would be under the responsibility of PORTOBRAS in
close cooperation with the ports of Rio and Santos.



- 18 -
(vi)  Training.   The training component of the project would consist of:
(a) advanced iF-service training in the PORTOBRAS system to support the
implementation of the institution building action programs; and (b) the
reorganization of PORTOBRAS' training center, consistent with the train-
ing needs of the port operators and with the policy and institutional
changes proposed for the subsector.  The first component would involve
close coordination betweer. the training experts and the consultants
working on institution building programs.   In the first year of the
project, about 30 man/months of the training expert's time would be
devoted to these activities, aiming at (various levels of) technology
transfer to over 1000 employees.   The second component would call for
the development of a master plan for the gradual restructuring of the
activities of PORTOBRAS' training center, based upon a detailed assess-
ment of the port operating companies' training needs.   The proposed
restructuring would provide for the direct involvement of the port
operators' managers in the design and implementation of the training
programs for their subordinates.   In the first year of the project's
implementation, this component would involve about 40 man/months of the
training experts' time aiming at basically working level technology
transfer to over 1800 employees mainly in the areas of equipment
maintenance and general cargo handling.
10.        Generally, the institution building component, would be carried out in
four phases. The first phase would be diagnostic work, to analyze in detail the
weak areas with high priorities for improvements. In the second phase recommenda-
tions for the necessary actions would be developed. In the third phase, based on
their review, the Government, PORTOBRAS and the Bank would decide which recommen-
dations should be implemented.  The accepted recommendations would be introduced
during the fourth phase. Over 50% of the cost of the institution building compo-
nent belongs to the fourth phase indicating its important implementation charac-
ter; in this phase the counterpart staff's role would be more cr4tical and exten-
sive as the transfer of new technologies, methods of operation and administrative
practices would take place.   All the phases would be carried out with expert
assistance, and with appropriate counterpart staff support from PORTOBRAS and the
port operators. (See Technical Annex, Schedule 2).
(b) Applied Research Component
11.         The Applied Research Component (US$17 million, of which 36% is Bank
financed) would aim to upgrade the research and operational capacity of the
National Hydraulics Research Institute (INPH), one of PORTOBRAS' "organizational
units", which has the responsibility for hydraulic studies to provide essential
base information for analyzing the need and the appropriate design of structures
and special installations for coastal zones, ports and waterways.  The Institute
is involved in the acquisition and analysis of field data and in the construction
and testing of scale models. The work includes investigations and data gathering
in the field, data analysis, physical model testing of ports and hydraulic struc-
tures with fixed and movable beds, subject to regular and irregular waves, combin-
ed with different current and wind conditions.   Also, the Institute is doing
geological investigations and sedimentation studies and it has recently started
mathematical modelling of hydraulic phenomena.
12.         There is a shortage of modern facilities and equipment in INPH and
therefore its investigations, the results of which are important base elements for



- 19 -
designing port facilities and for dredging and river training, are limited, often
offering conjectural rather than statistical  information.    The project would
finance upgraded research and operational capacity, so that INPH would effectively
assist in developing technically and economically appropriate investment projects
and play an important role in rationalizing the protection of the environment in
ports, harbors and the coastal region. In addition, INPH would provide, initially
guidance, and subsequently increasingly intensive training (starting with about 10
¶         key persons in 1989) to the port operators in designing, implementing and monitor-
ing environmental protection measures.  Appropriate allowance in the technology
transfer/advanced professional training subcomponent of the project would be
maintained for this purpose and the subsequent sector loan (para. 8) would further
strengthen this area.
13.       This project component would include: (a) expansion of physical facili-
ties for fluvial studies; (b) capacity expansion for mathematical modelling; (c)
acquisition of instruments and equipment for recording waves, currents, tempera-
tures, salinity, amounts of suspended sediments, wind velocities and directions
and instruments for field surveys; and (d) academic and on-the-job training cf
selected personnel in computational hydraulic and physical modelling and environ-
mental quality monitoring and protection.
(c) Engineering Studies/Preparation of Bidding Documents Com'-onent
14.         This component (US$12 million, of which 35% is Bank financed) would
support PORTOBRAS' investment preparatory work through technical assistance for
engineering studies which would provide PORTOBRA3 with technical information to
prepare bid documents for selected high priority projects.  These projects would
be identified during the course of reviewing and upgrading the Port Master Plans
and their selection for inclusion in this p,roject component would be in agreement
between the Government and PORTOBRAS, and subject to the Bank's approval.
III.   Project Cost, Financing Plan.
15.         The total cost of the project is estimated at US$44 million with a
foreign component of US$14.7 million (33%). For the institution building component
about 1050 man months of consultant time would be needed at a cost of US$8.7
million; the contribution of PORTOBRAS and the port companies (basically through
specifically assigned counterpart staff,  office and   training facilities)  is
estimated at US$6.3 million.  The cost of upgrading INPH's capacity is estimated
at about US$17 million and the Engineering Study component at US$12 million.  The
Bank loan of US$20 million would finance 45% of the project cost, representing all
the estimated foreign exchange costs and 18% of the local costs.   Sufficient
budgetary funds would be available for PORTOBRAS to meet its financial obligations
under the project. To accelerate implementation, retroactive financing up to US$1
million is recommended to meet costs incurred after June 12, 1987 (completion of
Appraisal) mainly for technology transfer in the areas of planning and port opera;
tions. Details of the cost estimates and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A of the Memorandum of the President.
B. Project Implementation
IV. Implementation, Procurement and Disbursement.
16.       To facilitate the project's implementation, PORTOBRAS has established a
Project Management Unit appropriately staffed by PORTOBRAS officials.  According



- 20 -
to its Terms of Reference which was approved by the Bank, the Unit, with the
support of a small number of outside consultants, if necessary, will guide, manage
and monitor the overall execution of the institution building program and It will
aim to ensure the successful tranefer of technologies to PORTOBRAS.  Also, the
Unit will be responsible to coordinate and monitor all the other project activi-
ties and maintain the project related documents.   The Project Coordinator is
responsible, through the ?lanning Director, to the President of PORTOBRAS. During
Loan Negotiations it was agreed that PORTOBRAS will maintain the Unit's continuous
operation and ensure the continued appointment of a su'tably qualified and expe-
rienced Project Coordinator and afford the Bank opportunity to comment on the
qualifications and experience of any candidate to such position before making any
appointment.
17.       With the exception of some selected areas requiring highly specialized
individual consultants, consulting firms and/or port authorities are expected to
be employed for the Institution Building and Engineering Study components of the
project. Selection and employment of the consultants would be in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines for the use of Consultants based on Terms of References
satisfactory to the Bank.  Due to the various degrees of interdependency of the
institution building action programs, (for example upgrading of the information
system should follow the organization structure upgrading), some of them would
overlap.  Therefore, to facilitate the work, taking into account the functional
interrelationship of the various areas and topics, the institution building tech-
nical assistance is planned to be organized in the following groups:   (a) Port
Operations where focus would be on the internal organization of the port compa-
nies, their labor uractices, operational methods, maintenance practices, and
terminal agreements; 'b) Corporate Operations where focus would be on corporate
policies and objectives, decision making procedures, marketing, costing, budgeting
and tariffs, PORTOBRAS' organization and on the development of Management Informa-
tion Systems; (c) Planning where operational and investment planning, and develop-
ment of port master plans would be focussed on; and (d) Training where, in addi-
tion to upgrading the work of PORTOBRAS' training center, specific activities to
support the project's implementation would be carried out. Detailed (Draft) Terms
of References for the various activities and the first year training program have
already been agreed to with PORTOBRAS at Loan Negotiations.
18.       The civil works would comprise a number of small contracts not expected
to attract foreign contractors, therefore precurement would be under LCB proce-
dures satisfactory to the Bank. Regarding mathematical modelling, PORTOBRAS would
arrange appropriate access to suitable computer prior to acquiring related soft-
ware. The equipment component represents highly specialized hydrodynamic research
instruments produced by a small number of manufacturers and would be procured
under International Shopping procedures satisfactory to the Bank.  Contracts for
goods and works of USS50,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank;
the balance of contracts would be subject to random post review by the Bank after
contract award.   Disbursement would be against standard documentation for all
'items (except those under US$50,000 equivalent, for which disbursements would be
made against Statements of Expenditure certified by PORTOBRAS) on the basis
indicated in Schedule B attached to the Memorandum of the President. The project
would be implemented over 6 1/2 years in line with the region profile for technic-
al assistance projects; however, the Government and PORTOBRAS are anxious to
implement the recommendations anticipated to result from this project sooner.
Therefore maximum flexibility has been designed into the project to permit comple-
tion in a shorter time.



2 1 -
V.   Special Account, Project Account and Audit.
19.        To reduce the time period during which PORTOBRAS would pre-finance the
Bank's share of project costs, a Special Account in US dollars with US$1 million
initial deposit would be established in the Central Bank.  Replenishment of the
Special Account would be on the basis of standard Bank procedures.  Documents in
support of replenishment applications would be required for expenditures against
contracts equal to US$50,000 equivalent or more. All other expenditures would be
made under Statements of Expenditures certified by PORTOBRAS.  In order to ensure
consistent availability of  counterpart  funds,  PORTOBRAS would  maintain in a
commercial bank an account in Cruzados, with funds available in the amounts that
would be required to meet in timely manner the fund requirements of the project in
accordance with the respective work and procurement procedures. Establishment of
this account is a condition of Loan Effectiveness.  In addition, PORTOBRAS would
establish and maintain appropriate records and accounts to identify all expendi-
tures financed under the Loan in a clear manner. The Special Account, ti'e Project
Account, as well as other accounts -and supporting records pertaining to the
services and goods financed under the loan, would be audited annually by independ-
ent auditors acceptable to the Bank and their report forwarded for Bank's review
at not more than five months after the end of each financial year.
VI. Agreed Actions, Project Conditionalities.
20.       The project, through appropriate implementation of the action programs,
would produce basically long-term, and to a large extent, non-quantifiable b3ne-
fits, by improving PORTOBRAS' and the port operators' capacity to utilize the sub-
sector's considerable productive potential.  Therefore, instead of standard port
project conditions such as productivity and financial targets, special assurances,
to implement the a^tion programs, were sought during Loan Negotiations.   More
specifically during Loan Negotiations it was agreed that:
(a) PORTOBRAS would:
(i) select and employ consultants and technical experts in such manner
and timeframe as to enable PORTOBRAS to meet the target dates for
key project activities including consultations between PORTOBRAS,
the Government and the Bank regarding recommendations for improve-
ments and the implementation of the accepted recommendations
(paras. 9 and 10 and Technical Annex, Schedule 2);
(ii) commence selection of high priority investment projacts for prepar-
ation of engineering studies and bid documents preparation not
later than April 30, 1989, and start the studies and document
preparation not later than September 30, 1989 for the selected
projects approved by the Bank (para. 14);
(iii) maintain a Project Management Unit and as the head of the Unit a
Project Coordinator with adequate qualifications and experience and
afford the Bank reasonable opportunity to comment on the qualifica-
tions and experience of any candidate to such position before
making any appointment (para. 16);
(iv) arrange appropriate access by April 30, 1988 to a suitable computer
for mathematical modelling and not to acquire software for mathe-
matical modelling under the project without appropriate access to
such computers (para. 18); and



- 22 -
(v)  maintain a project accounting system satisfactory to the Bank, and
a revolving account in cruzados with amounts that would be required
to meet in timely manner the fund requirements of the project in
accordance with the respective works and procurement schedules
(para. 19);
(b) retroactive financing up to US$1 million would be available (para. 15);
and
(c) standard Special Account procedures would be introduced to facilitate
disbursement under the Loan (para. 19).
21.       As conditions of loan effectiveness:
(i)  separate accounting system for the Project, satisfactory to the
Bank, should be established;
(ii) Project Account in form and substance satisfactory to the Bank
should be established;
(iif) cash-flow analysis for the Project, satisfactory to the Government
and the Bank, should be prepared; and
(iv)  adequate appropriation is made in the Uovernment's 1988 budget for
the Project.
VII.   Project Justification and Risks.
22.         The proposed project is in line with the Bank's general strategy by
starting the rationalization of the subsector's organization, improvement of its
management, introduction of more cost effective, modern operational practices,
improving the utilization of the productive capacity of the port subsector, and by
preparing the grcund for more comprehensive sector wide improvements to be under-
taken in future o.perations. The institutional/operational imptovements would lead
to reduced port costs, to strengthening Brazil's export market position and
increasing its foreign exchange earnings. The upgrading of planning capabilities
and mechanisms would lead to better resource allocation.
23.         This is the first Lank operation in the port subsector after a long
absence and therefore Bank experience, concerning the Government and PORTOBRAS'
capacity to implement the project appropriately and in a timely manner, is limit-
ed. Projects in other transport subsectors have been affected by delays and to a
lesser extent by cost overruns.   The main risk would be the possible delay of
studies and implementation of their recommendations because of lack of counterpart
funds or because of resistance to the recommendations or because of different
priorities due to changing Government policies.   The creation of a string of
project conditionalities as well as the provision for appropriately budgeted
counterpart funds together with intensive Bank involvement during implementation
should substantially mitigate this risk.
