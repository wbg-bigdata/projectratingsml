INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MAROC PHOSPHORE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A PH0PHATE FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Maroc Phosphore, with the Guarantee of the Kingdom of Morocco, for the
equivalent of US$50 million to help finance a project for a phosphoric acid
and mnono-ammonium phosphate plant. The loan would have a term of 14 years,
including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7.25 percent per annum. The
Government of Morocco would charge a guarantee fee of 1.75 percent per annum
on the outstanding amount of the Bank loan, bringing the cost of the loan to
Maroc Phosphore to 9 percent per annum. The project would be financed jointly
with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) which, through relending by the Guar-
antor, would contribute DM 75 million (US$26.8 million equivalent) on the same
terms and conditions as the Bank Loan. Also, the Moroccan Banque Nationale
potur le Developpement Economique (BNDE) would lend Maroc Phosphate US$8 mil-
lion, on the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects
of Morocco" (R329 MOR, dated February 7, 1974) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on March 6, 1974. The report is based on the findings of an economic
mission which visited Morocco in September 1973 and completed its analytical
work in December 1973. The impact on the Moroccan economy of more recent in-
creases in the prices of crude oil, which Morocco has to import, and phosphate,
which is the country's main export, is assessed in a preliminary way in para.
11. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Past Developments
3.        The overall performance of the Moroccan economy improved during the
Second Five-Year Plan (1968-72), despite difficult political circumstances in
1971 and 1972. Aided by favorable weather conditions and good crops in 1968,
1971 and 1972, real GDP growth accelerated from an average annual rate of
about 3 percent in 1960-67 (barely above the rate of population growth) to
5.6 percent in 1968-72, thus exceeding the modest Plan target of 4.3 percent,
and permitting real gains in private consumption of about 2 percent a year.
At the same time, the implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies
contributed to a significant improvement in Morocco's domestic and external
financial situation, despite shortfalls on planned capital inflows from of-
ficial external sources. Government saving and investment exceeded slightly
the modest Plan targets, while price stability was maintained. Following a
decade of recurring deficits, the balance of payments registered sizeable
surpluses in 1969-72, mainly because of sharply rising receipts from merchan-
dise exports, tourism and Moroccan workers in Europe. At the end of 1972,



- 2 -
MIorocco had accumulated net foreign assets equivalent to 3.5 months' imports
of goods and non-factor services.
4.        Although the acceleration of GDP growth in 1968-72 was in part
cue to generally favorable weather conditions, it appears that the economy
has moved onto a path of more rapid long-term growth.    Agriculture, export
industries, tourism and sectors with derived demand (energy, transportation,
communications and modern services) seem to have acquired a capacity for
sustained growth, in large part because of past investment and training. In
agriculture, expansion of irrigation, increased use of key inputs in rainfed
areas (improved seeds, fertilizers and timely ploughing) and a larger number
of trained extension personnel have caused faster output growth. In the
export sector, the phosphate company (OCP) has regained leadership in the
world market as a result of internal reorganization and investment carried
out during the Second Plan and the export company (OCE), which has a monopoly
over Morocco's exports of fresh and processed foodstuffs, has acquired con-
siderable dynamism in management and marketing. Further, a broad range of
industries, including sub-contracting companies, have emerged with a good
competitive position and sizeable sales on external markets.
I)        These achievements should not detract attention, however, from the
serious difficulties which Morocco still had to overcome at the end of the
Second Plan period. There was a need to revive private investment, which had
stagnated in 1971 and 1972 mainly because investors took a wait-and-see at-
titude in the light of political developments and the expectation of new in-
centives and new regulations regarding the association of Moroccan and foreign
capital in business ventures (Moroccanization laws). There was also a need
to raise private saving which remained at an insufficient level in part because
of the relatively low returns on domestic financial assets. Finally, the
Government would have to increase investment capacity in the public sector by
appropriate changes in staffing and organization.
6.        Difficult social problems also had to be tackled.    Unemployment
relaained at a high level, averaging 9 percent of labor force nationwide and
ranging between 12 and 16 percent in large urban centers. The urban popula-
tion in substandard housing was large and rising. Wealth and income differ-
ences between cities and villages, among regions, and between rich and poor
were widening, while about one third of the rural population in the less fer-
tile agricultural areas were experiencing a slow decline in real consumption.
Lotg-term Development Prospects
7.        Recognizing these difficulties and problems, the Government began
in 1971 to revise its.development policies, paying increasing attention to
social objectives. Reflecting the changed orientations, the Third Five-Year
Plan (1973-77) aims at:
sustaining real GDP growth of 7.5 percent a year from 1973
to 1977, mainly through a 10 percent a year rise in exports
and,a doubling of investment over the Plan period; and



- 3 -
improving distribution of growth benefits, mainly through
further land distribution to poor farmers and more emphasis
on rainfed farming in agriculture, the association of Moroccan
nationals with foreigners in services and several industrial
sub-sectors, large increases in Government spending on social
services and low-cost housing, a more progressive tax system,
and appropriate changes in wages and in the prices of basic
agricultural commodities.
Departing from past financial orthodoxy, the Plan calls for an expansionary
fiscal policy and a liberal credit policy, accepting the risk of less price
stability. It recognizes that, in spite of faster economic growth, an in-
creased public works program and continued emigration, unemployment may rise
in absolute, and perhaps also in relative, terms because the growth of the
working-age population is accelerating (from 2 percent a year in the 1960's
to 4 percent a year in the 1970's).
8.        In accordance with its export-oriented strategy, the Plan gives
priority to sectors contributing to exports (agriculture, fishing, mining,
food processing, sub-contracting industries, transportation and tourism).
This priority is reflected in the allocation of Government resources to in-
vestment in these sectors, as well as in the new measures taken in August
1973 to encourage industrial exports and private investment. Achievement of
the Plan's export target will depend on further improvements in some export
sectors (fresh and processed foodstuffs, tourism and sub-contracting), and
also on continued external demand. While external demand for phosphate is
expected to remain strong, demand for other Moroccan goods and services may
weaken over the next few years as a result of the economic slowdown in
developed countries following the recent increases in petroleum prices. On
balance, real export growth, which exceeded Plan expectations in 1973, will
probably be somewhat below Plan targets during most of 1974-77.
9.        The Plan proposes significant changes in the investment strategy
to increase labor intensity, and improve the situation of less favored groups
of society and less developed areas of the country. Education, health and
housing, together receive a significantly higher share of planned Government
investment (23 percent) than during the Second Plan (11 percent). Among
sectors, the main change concerns agriculture, for which the Plan de-
emphasizes dam construction, and favors equipment of existing irrigation
areas, intensification of rainfed cropping, improvement of animal husbandry
and implementation of land reform. New incentives for private investment are
less biased in favor of imported equipment than the previous system and en-
courage efficient operations and location in less developed areas.
1(.       In changing its investment strategy, Morocco is breaking new ground,
and significant shortfalls on planned investment could well be experienced
in new priority sectors as a result of staffing and organizational constraints,
which can only be relieved progressively.   Shortfalls will probably affect
mainly rainfed cropping, livestock production, low-cost housing and tourism
infrastructure. In addition, most of 1973 was lost for the revival of pri-
vate investment, since the new incentives were introduced only in August, and



- 4 -
the start of new public investment programs was delayed, since the Plan was
issued only in July. Finally, measures taken in 1973 to complete the recovery
of foreign-owned farms and "marocanise" business imply management changes
which may temporarily restrain production and investment. For these reasons,
investment may fall short of the Plan's target, and GDP growth may not exceed
7 percent a year in 1974-77. The attainment of the Plan's income distribution
objectives will to some extent be compromised by the investment shortfalls
affecting programs designed to increase the productive capacity and situation
of less favored groups in rural and urban areas.
11.       Financial resources are not expected to be a constraint in the
medium term provided increased inflows of official assistance are achieved.
The strengthening of the balance of payments since 1969 has continued in 1973,
and in 1974 Morocco will benefit from a tripling of the price of phosphate
rock. Increased earnings from this source will exceed the increase in the
country's petroleum import bill due to higher prices by an estimated $300
million in 1974. This net gain may be eroded in later years, since the price
of phosphate is likely to level off due to increased world supply while prices
of imports and import requirements will keep rising. Nonetheless, until the
end of the Plan period, phosphate and other exports, workers' remittances and
capital inflows should provide enough foreign exchange to meet import require-
ments and maintain reserves at a sufficient level. On the domestic side, the
phosphate company (OCP) will be able to make large, additional remittances to
tthe Government, which will help finance the planned level of public investment.
However, the Government will have to proceed with planned tax measures in
order to make the tax system more responsive to economic growth and more
equitable, and with planned improvements of the capital market to facilitate
the mobilization of private saving and the financing of private investment.
12.       The financial situation may become more difficult beyond 1977, if
the predicted trends in exports (with no further gains from phosphate prices)
and import requirements continue. To prepare for this eventuality, M4orocco
needs to increase, as planned, the level of external borrowing on favorable
terms from official sources, and this will require improved project prepara-
tion. At the end of 1973, Morocco's external debt amounted to an estimated
$890 million excluding undisbursed amounts. Service payments represented only
8 percent of goods and non-factor services exports. Although long-term pros-
pec ts are for more pressure on the balance of payments than at present and a
rise in the debt service ratio, Morocco can service substantial additional debt.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
13.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 20 projects with fi-
nancing totalling $378.0 million (net of cancellations), of which $146 million
was lent over the last two years. Four projects have been financed under
IDA credits totalling $36.8 million. IFC investments amount to $2.9 million.
Implementation of projects is often slow to start, frequently due to cumber-
some Government disbursement procedures, but with time performance usually
improves.  The Sebou irrigation project (Loan 643-MOR of November 13, 1969



for $46 million) showed little progress for a long time, because of initial
management difficulties, slow processing of iecessary land reforms and a
flood of unprecedented magnitude in 1970. At present, however, the project
is showing satisfactory progress. The water supply project (Loan 850-MOR of
July 19, 1972 for $48 million) suffered from initial difficulties and delays
in implementing a number of basic measures aimed at reorganizing the major
agency in the sector. Following substantial efforts by the Government, pro-
gress is now satisfactory. Project implementation by the three autonomous fi-
nancial institutions in agriculture, industry and tourism to which the Bank
lends, is generally satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1974, and notes
on the execution of on-going projects.
14.       The Bank Group strategy is generally to support achievement of
selected objectives of the third Five-Year Plan in connection with (a) proj-
ects whose primary justification is in terms of their contribution to produc-
tion and the balance of payments but through which the Bank can make a major
coitribution in terms of institution building and sector development, and
(b) programs geared more directly to,attacking the fundamental problems of
poverty in Morocco. Particularly in agriculture and urbanization and to a
lesser extent in industry, our approach will be to design projects which
yield substantial benefits in traditional economic terms and at the same
time contribute directly to improving income distribution. The program in-
cludes several projects, mostly in agriculture, which might serve as pilot
schemes for repeater projects. Because the pace at which Bank Group lending
can be carried out will continue to depend largely on the speed at which the
Government prepares projects and takes related policy decisions, special
efforts will be made to help prepare projects and programs.
15.       In the financing of agricultural projects the Bank has up to now
helped develop large-scale irrigation schemes and agricultural credit. The
Bank now stresses the importance of efficient organization of the ssector, of
land reform and of the development of small farms with emphasis on attacking
the problem of rural poverty. The Government has recently accelerated land
distribution to small-holders and landless laborers and is presently prepar-
ing projects for small farmers, mostly in rainfed areas, for which it has
sought Bank financing.
16.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.    Two
IDA credits have been made to improve technical and vocational training. A
UNESCO project identification mission, in the framework of the Bank UNESCO
cooperative program, visited the country in September 1973 to review the
sector's development and to help formulate future Bank projects.
17.       Industry and tourism development has so far been financed through
the two DFC 's (Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique and Credit
Immobilier et Hotelier). These DFC's are expected to continue to be main
channels for Bank lending in these sectors. However, as Executing Agency
for a UNDP financed study, the Bank is helping to prepare a tourism infra-
structure project which would alleviate the scarcity of improved land for



- 6 -
hotel development. Projects in these sectors as well as the project pres-
ently prfoposed help Morocco to raise its foreign exchange earnings and provide
an opportunity for the Bank to help improve sectoral policies. The Bank
supported a study now completed of the interest rate structure in Morocco and
the recent enactment of a new investment code. The latest loan to BNDE (Loan
890-MOR) signed in May 1973 also aimE at improving the employment effects of
BNDF. financing.
1i.       The first transportation loan, a $14.6 million Bank/IDA blend, was
for a highway project and included financing of a sector review which served
as ca basis for a second loan of $29 million recently approved, as well as
recommendations on transport policy. A proposed third loan would permit to
continue the dialogue on policy and be a vehicle for further efforts to im-
prove maintenance and administration of the highway system.
19.       The first Bank financing of public utilities in urban areas was the
$48 million Water Supply loan signed in July 1972. A second loan of $25 mil-
lion for a power project was signed in October 1973. Both projects try to
improve the organization of public utilities. The social problems due to
rapid urbanization are also expected to be tackled through a site and services
project presently being prepared by the Government, in line with the emphasis
on urban housing and infrastructure in the Third Plan.
0..       A consultative group for Morocco was formed in April, 1967 under the
chairmanship of the Bank. It includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japani, Kuwait, Spain, the U.K., the U.S., IMF, UNDP, OECD/DAC, the African
Development Bank and the European Investment Bank. The last meeting of the
Grouip, on March 28 and 29, 1974, expressed satisfaction with the improvement
in Morocco's economic performance in recent years, and the emphasis in the
Third Five-Year Plan (1973-77) on improving the distribution of growth bene-
fits. The gross inflow of official loans and grants to Morocco rose from
$129 million in 1966 to $159 million (of which $18 million in grants) in 1971,
but temporarily fell to $138 million in 1972 and $115 million in 1973. The
major sources of aid were the U.S., Germany, the Bank Group and France.
21.       At the end of 1973, the Bank Group's share in Morocco's external
public debt was estimated at 13.4 percent on a disbursement basis. The
share of the Bank Group in debt service was 11.2 percent in 1973. By the
encl of the 1970's the Bank Group's share in public debt and debt service
is expected to rise to about 20 percent.
PART III - MINING AND MINERAL, PROCESSING IN MOROCCO
Geimra 1
2h'.      Morocco is endowedi with varied1 mineral resources.  It possesses the
world's largest reserves of phosphate rock (an estimated 40 billion tons) of
g,,ood quality that can be easily extracted and are close to the Atlantic coast.



-7-
In 1973, it was the world's third main producer of phosphate rock after the
USA and the USSR, and the largest exporter with more than one third of world
trade. Morocco also has sizeable reserves of coal, iron ore and pyrrhotite,
as well as several other minerals, such as lead, zinc, manganese and copper.
Dtie to obsolescent mining equipment or depletion of known deposits, their
exploitation is often not competitive.
23.       Minerals are state property and the Government plays a dominant
role in mining and processing since. The Office Cherifien des Phosphates
(OCP), a state-owned company, mines and sells phosphate rock, and exercises
control over phosphate processing through affiliates (Maroc Chimie and Maroc
Phosphore). The Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minieres (BRPM)
is responsible for prospecting, mining and processing other minerals either
alone, or in partnership with private firms. The Government grants various
fiscal and other incentives to encourage private investment in the mining
and processing of minerals other than phosphate.
24.       Morocco continued to export most of its minerals in unprocessed
forn during the Second Five-Year Plan (1968-72), despite a Plan objective of
increasing export value through processing. The growth of mineral exports
averaged only 3 percent a year in current prices during the Plan period, and
came entirely from phosphate. OCP invested $125 million and underwent an
internal reorganization which enabled it to increase phosphate rock exports
from 9.3 million tons in 1967 to 13.6 million tons in 1972. However, because
of a 10 percent decline in the price of phosphate, its share in total export
earnings fell from 25.4 percent in 1967 to 22.8 percent in 1972. Exports of
other minerals, stagnated in volume and value mainly because of weak external
demand. The Plan's processing objective was implemented in the case of
phosphate-based fertilizer production and pelletisation of iron ore. Maroc
Chimie, which was set up to produce fertilizer, increased its intake of phos-
phate to 600,000 tons in 1972 and raised its fertilizer exports from $10 mil-
lion in 1967 to $14 million in 1972, despite serious technical difficulties.
Production of high-grade iron ore pellets began in 1972. In 1972, mineral
processing was still a small sub-sector, contributing less than 7 percent of
value added in the manufacturing sector. While mining and mineral processing
continued to be of great importance for the balance of payments (32.2 percent
of merchandise exports in 1972), their contribution to GDP (about 5 percent)
andl employment (about 2 percent) remained small.
lnvestment Program
25.       The Third Five-Year Plan (1973-77) puts heavy emphasis on mining
and mineral processing for export. To increase exploration, efficiency and
domestic processing, it calls for investment totalling about $850 million
during 1973-77 for phosphate and other minerals; it expects that the mining
sector will grow by 13 percent and mineral exports by 12.5 percent a year,
and that mineral processing will become an increasingly important industrial
sub-sector. This would represent a considerable improvement over past
results, and seems justified on the basis of export prospects for phosphate,
other minerals and their derivatives.



- 8 -
26.       The investment program of OCP during 1973-77 amounts to an estimated
$550 million. This comprises $250 million for expanding and modernizing phos-
phate rock mining, $225 million for the production of phosphoric acid and
mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP) and $75 million for transport facilities. Maroc
Chimie plans to invest about $55 million to expand output and exports of sul-
furic acid, phosphoric acid and phosphatic fertilizers, based on local phosphate
and pyrrhotite.  OCP expects to raise exports of phosphate rock to 26 million
tons in 1977 up from 16 million tons in 1973, and to meet the local demand of
Maroc Chimie and Maroc Phosphore estimated at about 2.5 million tons in 1977.
OCP and its two affiliates have the managerial and technical expertise needed
to implement this program. The expansion program seems justified by external
demand prospects since over the long run, world demand for phosphate rock is
expected to rise by about 7 percent a year. A current shortage, bringing
about a sharp price increase (see para 28) and a rise in quantity are estimated
tentatively to bring earnings from phosphate rock exports to about $750 million
in 1974 as compared to $202 million in 1973. While the high phosphate price
may not last for the remainder of the 1970's due to likely increases in world
production it will nonetheless provide OCP with ample financial resources to
meet investment requirements.
27.       The Third Plan calls for investment totalling about $300 million
during 1973-77 in minerals other than phosphate, of which $125 million would
be for oil exploration. Private participations are expected to be about $200
million. In August 1973, the Government introduced new measures to encourage
private investment in mining and mineral processing. Nonetheless, implementa-
tion of this program seems less certain as private participations are not yet
firmed up.
Phosphate and Fertilizer Market
28.       World production of phosphate rock rose from 40 to 90 million tons
between 1960 and 1972, with the US (42 percent), the t1SSR (22 percent) and
Morocco (16 percent) as leading producers. World export trade increased from
29.2 to 43.5 million tons between 1965 and 1972, with about two thirds of the
trade going to Western and Eastern Europe; the main exporters were Morocco
(31 percent of world exports), the US (29 percent) and the USSR (14 percent).
The world rock supply/demand situation moved from a world wide over-supply
in the late 1960's and early 1970's to a tight balance in early 1973 and a
serious shortage by late 1973 as a result of increased world-wide demand; the
same trend applied to phosphoric acid based high grade fertilizers. Prices
reflected this development; export prices for 1974 are 2.5 times to more than
3 times higher ($45 for the highest commercial grade) than those prevailing
in early 1973. The sharp increase in prices is also explained by a necessary
price recovery following a depressed price situation over most of the last
decade. World rock prices are expected to remain at their present (early
1974) high levels through late 1975 because of an expected continuing tight
supply. The world rock capacity/demand coverage is, however, likely to improve
from 1976 onwards; long-v-rm FOB equilibrium prices are therefore forecast to
stabilize--by 1976/77- it about 20 percent below the 1974 price levels.



-9-
29.       Major structural changes have also occurred in production and trade
of phosphate fertilizers in the past 10 years. Increased demand for high grade
fertilizers has induced a rapid growth in the production and trade of inter-
mediate products, such as phosphoric acid, in which developing countries are
more and more participating. The emerging trade pattern will combine increas-
ing quantities of intermediate and finished products with raw materials, rock
phosphate and sulfur. This new trade pattern favors large units which, as it
is the case in Morocco, are close to sources of raw materials and favolably
located for exporting. The shortage of phosphoric acid based high grade fer-
tilizers in recent years, combined with the increase in rock prices, resulted
in a sizeable upward adjustment in prices of finished products, about 50 per-
cent for phosphoric acid between mid-1973 and early 1974. However, the supply
demand situation is likely to improve from 1976 on, bringing a stabilization
in long-term prices at a level somewhat below the current level.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       A report entitled:   "Appraisal of the Maroc Phosphore Phosphoric
Acid and Mono-ammonium Project" (No. 351 MOR of April 19, 1974) is being
distributed separately. A loan and Project summary is attached as'Annex III.
The project was presencted to the Bank in June 1971 and a formal request to
help finance the project made in December 1972. The proposed project was
appraised in February and October 1973; a follow-up mission took place in
March 1974. Negotiations were held in W4ashington beginning January 28, 1974.
The Borrower was represented by Mr. Guessous (Financial Director, Office
Chierifren des Phosphates), and the Guarantor by Mr. Belghiti, of the Directorate
of Economic Affairs, Prime Minister's Office.
Description
31.       The project consists in the erection of a plant near the port of
Safi on the Atlantic coast, about 200 km south of Casablanca, to produce for
export 371,250 tons per year of phosphoric acid (P205) and 225,780 tons per
year of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) at full capacity. These products are key
intermediates in the manufacturing of high grade phosphate fertilizers which
are in great and increasing demand in world markets. The project is sponsored
by the OCP, and will be implemented by Maroc Phosphore. The proposed project
is a key link in the Government's and OCP's strategy to participate in the
rapidly emerging world trade in intermediate products used in manufacturing
high grade fertilizers.
32.       In 1971, the Government of Morocco and OCP requested, and the Bank
agreed, that the project be executed as a lump sum turnkey contract. The
early conclusion of a turnkey contract was necessary to: (i) increase poteri-
tial buyers' confidence in the project; and (ii) obtain firm project costs
essential for determining a sales strategy and starting sales negotiations;
otlher reasons were the advantages of single responsibility in project execu-
tion and the acquisition of technical expertise in phosphoric acid production
which was lacking in OCP.   OCP signed a first plant construction contract in

June 1973 for about two-thirds of the project capacity, and project execution
has commenced. This first contract included provisions for project expansion.
Following favorable market developments, and to take advantage of an unchanged
price offer, OCP, in April 1974, completed negotiations witlh the same supplier
for a supplementary contract based on identical terms to cover together with
the first contract the overall construction of the project's main facilities
andl related infrastructure.
13.       International competitive bidding was used to select the consortium
which is to execute the project at a fixed lump sum price including an ade-
quate escalation formula. OCP invited bids from several consortia of special-
ized firms, each under the leadership of one firm (the contractor) who was to
have responsibility for the entire project. The Bank agreed to a three-phase
selection procedure: (i) prequalification of consortia after international
advertising; (ii) invitation to prequalified consortia to submit unpriced
technical offers conforming to detailed tender documents; and, (iii) after
clarification and technical adjustments of offers; call for a lump sum price
for most of the project work which, together with the technical offer, was to
serve as the basis for bid evaluation. Out of thirteen responsive bids, five
consortia were prequalified and asked to present price proposals. The five
contractors were from the US, Belgium, France, Germany, and Japan. The lowest
evaluated bid was submitted by a consortium headed by Friedrich Uhde GmbH
(Uhde) of Germany. Uhde and the other members of the consortium are well
known and qualified firms: Polimex-Cekop (Polimex) of Poland; Lurgi Gesells-
chaft fur Chemie and Huttenwesen GmbH (Lurgi); Siemens A.G. (Siemens), Nissan
of Japan, and Fisons of the UK.   The contract is based on a lump sum price
with payments in Dirham for local cost, in clearing dollars for the Polimex
part as per a sub-contract between Uhde and Polimex, and in Deutsche mark for
the remaining foreign exchange balance.   A payment schedule in the three cur-
rencies was agreed, and payments are specified at intervals and in amounts
proportional to the contractor's expected cash outlays and work progress.
Project Execution
34.       "Maroc Phosphore" was formed to build and operate the project.    The
Company functions as a "Societe Anonyme" under Moroccan commercial laws. Its
initial authorized share capital is DH 1 million and will be increased to
provide for additional equity subscriptions as execution of the project
proceeds. OCP will own all of MP's shares. MP sales, finance and accounting
functions will be managed by OCP. Plant and production management will be
autonomous. OCP's General Manager is also Chairman of the MP board.
35.       Engineering, construction, erection and start-up of the plant are
the responsibility of the turnkey contractor. Following completion of the
first part of the project scheduled for October 1, 1975, cormnercial operations
are expected to begin in January 1976, after a 3 months testing period. Fa-
cilities corresponding to the second construction contract are expected to
stairt operations in Aug.w: 1976. OCP and MP are assisted bv an experienced
technical advisor, Ila Jr Topsoe A/S of Denmark. A satisfactory organization
for project execution nias been developed and includes: the MP project team,
the nucleus of the new company; the various OCP departments involved; the



technical advisor Topsoe; the Contractor's team; and an OCP group of engineers
working on future intermediates manufacturing projects. These organizational
arrangements are expected to ensure efficient project execution. Furthermore,
given the expected difficulties in recruiting Moroccan chemical engineers,
Topsoe and the Contractor, as part of their contracts with OCP, will assist
in the recruitment and training -- in Morocco and abroad -- of key personnel,
including expatriates if needed.
36.       Since the plant will be adjacent to an existing chemical plant
(Maroc Chimie), the company will benefit from existing infrastructure, with
resulting cost savings. Certain additional infrastructure facilities needed
for, but not part of, the project and estimated to cost about DH 36 million
(US$8 million), will be built by the appropriate Government agencies closely
supervised by OCP and MP; the necessary budget allocations have been made.
These facilities include: the supply of freslh water through modification of
a canal, heightening of a small dam and installation of a conduit or pumping
facilities; installations for handling of sulfur at the port; and railroad
equipment and siding. Service tariffs, to be paid by MP, have been agreed
upon with the agencies involved. Workers' housing will be provided by the
regional authorities. A schedule for construction of these facilities to
meet the requirements of the project has been agreed upon with the Govern-
ment. (Guarantee Agreement Section 2.04 and the Schedule thereto).
37.       Of the principal raw materials:   (i) phosphate rock will be supplied
by train from OCP's Youssoufia mine, under a long-term supply contract with
OCP the draft of which was found satisfactory by the Bank and the signature
of which is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan (Loan Agreement
Section 9.01 (e)); (ii) sulfur will be imported in dry lump form under long-
term contracts; and (iii) small quantities of ammonia will be bought from
various sources on a spot basis. Catalysts and chemicals will all be imported.
Known rock reserves at Youssoufia are adequate to supply the project with the
same grade over more than its expected economic life of 12.5 years.
38.       Phosphoric acid will be shipped from Safi to delivery points in
Europe, India and Brazil in three specialized self-unloading, ocean-going
ships, equipped with rubber-lined or stainless steel tanks. A shipping
company, Marphocean, has been formed -- with an initial share capital of D1 4
million -- to purchase and operate the ships under Moroccan flag; Marphocean
is jointly owned by the Moroccan National Shipping Company COMANAV (45 per--
cent) which already owns 11 ships and has a leading role in ship chartering
and sea transport of Moroccan goods, and by OCP (25 percent). The balance
(30 percent) will be owned by the French ship engineering firm, Gazocean,
one of the world's leading firms in the shipping of liquified or pressurized
gases and chemicals. The Bank is not financing the shipping facilities, but
a condition of effectiveness of the loan, as OCP will enter into a long-term
charter agreement with a carrier acceptable to the Bank. (Loan Agreement,
Section 9.01 (d)).
Cost Estimates
39.       Total investment costs for the project, summarized in Annex IIT,
aro estimated to be DH 657 million (IJS$148.6 million). Total financing,



- 12 -
including interest during construction, is DH 687 million (US$155.5 million).
Cost estimates include the lump sum price of DH 405 million (US$91.6 million)
for the turnkey contract. Cost estimiates for all major items outside the
turnkey contract have been prepared ly OCP and MP were reviewed by the Bank
and have been found acceptable. A price escalation clause based on a formula
with reasonable estimates for increases of component prices is included in
the contract. In addition, an overall contingency (18 percent of project cost
excluding working capital and interest during construction) is included to
c:over unforeseeable expenditures. This is considered adequate in view of the
short construction time. The foreign exchange costs include DH 55 million
(USS12.6 million) for goods and services subcontracted and to be paid for in
clearing dollars for Polish deliveries. Local costs include DH 18 million
for taxes and registration fee.
Financing Plan
40.       External financing for the project is to come jointly from the Bank
and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW). While the proposed Bank loan would
be made directly to MP, the KfW loan equivalent to $26.8 million will be made
to the Government following KfW's usual practice and on-lent to MP. The Bank
and the KfW Loan are linked by cross-effectiveness provision (section 9.01(b),
Loan Agreement) and cross default provisions (section 8.02(a) and 8.03(a),
Loan Agreement). Debt financing for the project would be completed by an $8
million loan from BNDE. The three loan totalling $84.8 million would finance
55 percent of project costs. $70.7 of equity financing would be provided by
OCP. The equity would finance the local costs, the costs of Polish supplies
(US$12.6 million) which will be paid for in clearing dollars, and also US$2.7
million equivalent convertible foreign exchange costs. MP has agreed to
maintain a 55:45 debt equity ratio (Loan Agreemnent Section 5.08).
41.       The proposed Bank loan would cover 32 percent of project costs and
57 percent of convertible foreign exchange expenditures. It would be for 14
years with 4 years of grace. NP would pay to the Government a guarantee fee
at the rate of 1-3/4 percent (Guarantee Agreement Section 2.05), bringing the
total cost of Bank funds for MP to 9 percent. The KFW loan would be made to
the Government at 2 percent for 30 years including ten years of grace and would
be on-lent to MP for the same maturity and grace period, and at the same ef-
fective rate of interest as the Bank loan. The BNDE loan will also be made
at the same effective interest rate and conditions as the Bank loan. OCP has
agreed to subscribe for, and pay in, the increased share capital of MP accord-
ing to an agreed schedule (Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.01).
In the event of a cost overrun, OCP and the Government guarantee to provide
additional funds, both foreign and local, necessary to complete the project,
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (Guarantee Agreement, Section
2.03; Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement Section 2.02).
Disbursements
42        Disbursement, of the Bank and KFW portions of the loan financing
the turnkey contract will be made pro-r;tta against lump sum invoices submitted



- 13 -
by MP and in agreement with the contracts payment schedule. The Bank will not
finance goods and services procured in Poland.
43.       OCP has so far made US$12.8 million advance payments to the contract-
or in convertible foreign exchange. These payments are proposed to be retro-
actively financed by the lenders, the BNDE Loan being fully disbursed first.
The proportionate Bank share will be US$3.1 million, representing about 6 per-
cent of the Bank loan.
Financial Position
44.       The Company is to maintain a debt service coverage of at least 1.4
and not to incur any debt that would increase its debt equity ratio beyond
55:45 throughout the forecast period of 12 years. The project's financial
rate of return would be 16.9 percent after corporate income tax, under con-
servative estimates regarding capital, and operating cost and revenue. Tech-
nical risks of plant design and operations and risks of substantial delays or
major cost overruns are considered low, owing to the contracting procedure
followed and the employment of a qualified technical advisor (Topsoe).
45.       OCP (shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03) and the Govern-
ment (Guarantee Agreement, Section 2.03) will guarantee MP's sound liquidity
and financial position through financial covenants. Furthermore, MP has agreed
to inform the Bank prior to undertaking any major new capital investment in
manufacturing of intermediate and finished phosphate fertilizers (Loan Agreement
Section 5.06). Finally, MP has agreed to have its accounts audited independently
(Loan Agreement Section 5.02).
Marketing Arrangements
46.       MP's sales strategy, covering the first five years of the project's
operation is to establish itself in key and expanding consumption areas. Sales
would concentrate in four major zones: Eastern and Northwestern Europe, India
and Brazil. Sales contracts are being finalized that cover virtually the
entire plant output during the first two years of operation and about 85 percent
thereafter. Sales arrangements satisfactory to the Bank and covering at least
50 percent (in 1976) and 60 percent (in 1977 through 1979) of the estimated
annual plant capacity, would be made as a condition of loan effectiveness
(Loan Agreement, Section 9.01 (c). The expected average 1976 prices for MP's
sales, US$210 per ton of acid and US$150 per ton of MAP FOB Safi, is in line
with the forecast long-term equilibrium price in world markets.
Economic Rate of Return
47.       The economic rate of return of the project is expected to be 21.2
percent. It is highly sensitive to output prices (a 5 percent increase in
revenues adds nearly 3 percentage paints) and to phosphate rock prices (a 10
percent drop in rock prices adds 2 percentage points); it, however, remains
satisfactory (19.2 percent) if the market price rather than the opportunity
cost for rock phosphate is used and if the price of sulfur is increased by
more than 5 percent.

43.       In addition to its directly quantifiable economic benefits, the proj-
ect will generate substantial external benefits. It will: help increase em-
ployment levels in the Youssoufia mines which are using labor-intensive tech-
niques in a region where employment alternatives are low; develop manufactur-
ing activities in line with the Moroccan policy for iTidustrial decentralization
and compensate for the decline in fishing activities of the Safi regiQn    help
OCI participate in the world trade in intermediate fertilizers; provide edu-
cation opportunities through training of personnel; and constitute a trainigr
center for future siilar projets in Morocco.
49.       Appropriate measures to control effluents are provided for in the
project. Waste from the sulfuric acid unit will be delivered to the neigh-
boring Maroc Chimie plant to be reprccessed; gypsum will be repulped in sea
water and disposed of into the ocean. This method, used since 1965, has
not created any pollution problem. Storage and handling installations for
solids will receive de-dusting equipment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Maroc Phosphore, the
draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the Bank, the
draft Shareholders' Guarantee Agreement, among the Bank, the OCP and Maroc
Phosphore,                                              the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
51.       Features of the Agreements of special interest are described in
paragraphs 33, 36, 40, 41 and 42 of this report. (Loan Agreement, bection 9.01)
52.       Special conditions of effectiveness of the Agreements would be that
the effectiveness of the KfW loan and relencding arrangements and the conclusion
of long-term contracts by Maroc Phosphore for the sale of its products, for the
shipping of products to be exported and for the purchase of phosphate rock.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Cr. No. 79  First Education Project: US$11 million Credit of October 11, 1965;
Closing Date: September 3(), 1974.
Considerable delays have affected the implementation of the project,
which has been considered a problem project since 1968. However, performance
inas improved significantly since September 1972; construction and equipmenit
of all schools (except industrial equipment in two schools) has been complcted,
and all schools are in use, project mainagement is now satisfactory, construc-
tion accounts have been brought up-to-date, local funds have been released
for the project and the Association's procurement procedures for internationlal
bidding for furniture and equipment are being followed. In 1968, as a result
of educational reforms, construction of three agricultural schools was dis-
continued with IDA's approval.  The Closing Date has been extended three times
fronm the original date to September 30, 1974, to allow for rebidding of the
industrial equipment and comiplete disbursements; a further postponement to
December 31, 1974 will be necessary to complete procurement.
Cr. No. 266  Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August 18, 1971;
Closing Date: April 30, 1976.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific
sections of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems of the
Borrower, and technical assistance for project administration and school main-
tenanice. Subsequently the Association agreed not to finance two Vocational
Training Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an
estimated amount of about US$1.0 million or 11 percent of the credit, repres-
entinig the financing of the above-mentioned project itemrs, has been transferred
to the unallocated category for future reallocation and/or cancellation. The
project unit has made significant effort to catch up with initial delays (about
ten months) in the appointment of consultant architects and in the recruitment
of local personnel and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit.
Implementation has progressed significantly but it is forecast that an exten-
sion of the Closing Date by about one year will be necessary.
1,   These notes are designed to infnrr the i xecutive Directors regarding
thie progress of irojects in execuL`on, and in particular to report any
problems whiich are being encountered, anid the action being taken to
remedy them.  Thev sbould be read in this sense, and withi the under-
standing that they ao niot purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strenL ths and wea.Liesses in project execution.

n. No. 642, Cr. No. 167  Highway Project; US$14.6 million of November 13, 1969;
Original Closing Date: February 28, 1974;
Current Closing Date: August 31, 197L.
The project suffered from initial delays; however, it should be
completed physically early in 1974 and within the estimated cost. By February,
1977, $6.0 million was still undisbursed out of the combined credit/loan,
mainly because of cumbersome Government disbur8ement procedures. Ways of ex-
pediting payments were discussed by the last supervision mission in July 1973
and at the negotiations for the Second Highways Project. The original closing
date was extended to August 31, 1974.
Ln. No. 643 Irrigation Project: US$46 million Loan of November 13, 1969;
Closing Date: November 30, 1978.
After initial management difficulties, the progress in implementing
the project is now satisfactory and on schedule. In 1970 a flood of unpre-
cedented magnitude occurred causing delays in project implementation while
also indicating the need for additional flood protection work. The distri-
bution to small farmers of foreign-owned lan(ds to be expropriated proceeded
slowly as Government revised its policy on land reform on a national basis.
In March 1973 it decided to nationalize all foreign owned lands and a schedule
for land distribution in the project area is now under preparation. Experience
gained in the course of project implementation has shown that the cultivation
of sugar cane and sugar beet in the project area would require the construc-
tion of a new sugar cane factory and reinforcement of the road network. A
second project to provide for the additional investment now required has now
been appraised.
Ln. No. 704 First Hotel Development Project; US$10.0 million of August 12, 1970;
Original Closing Date: December 31, 1973;
Current Closing Date: December 31, 1974.
Disbursements have been lagging behind commitments as construction
of some hotels ran into difficulties in 1971-73. The closing date was extended
to December 31, 1974. About $1.2 million was cancelled out of the amount of
the loan. Projects for 1974 have substantially improved and the Loan is likely
to be fully disbursed by the end of 1974.
Ln. No. 736 Fifth BNDE Project; US$35 million of May 30, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The Terminal Date for the submission of projects was postponed once
from June 30, 1973 to December 30, 1973, because of likely cancellations of
present commitments. Due mainly to sluggish investment activity, disburse-
ments fell behind commitments in 1971 to 1973, but with the return of in-
vestors' confidence disbursements are expected to pick up the lag shortly.

Lni. No. 648  Second llotel Development Project; US$15 million of June 30, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Commitments have initially been lagging behind expectations as in
che case of Loan No. 704 due to sluggish investment activity, but the loan
should be fully committed bv the end of 1974, as against original estimates
of year-end 1973. With the improved investment climate and with the publica-
tion of the investment code, commitments are already picking up.
Ln. No. 850 Water Supply Project; US$48 million Loan of July 19, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project includes a number of institution building measures.
Only when these were substantially implemented was the loan declared effec-
tive on Hay 2, 1973. After initial difficulties, substantial efforts have
been made by the Government to clarify ONEP's functions, strengthen its finan-
cial autonomy, and enforce water tariffs applicable to distribution agencies.
Difficulties arose in the course of 1973 concerning procurement procedures for
a major contract which have now been solved satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 861, Cr. No. 338   Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$34.0 inillion
of October 10, 1972; Closing Date: August 31, 1976.
The project has been progressing satisfactorily and disbursements
had reached US$10 million by the end of February 1974 in line with the appraisal
forecast.  Progress under the Loan/Credit is satisfactory.
Ln. No. 890   Sixth BNDE Project; US$24 million of May 14, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 197G.
The original date of effectiveness which was August 20, 1973 was
extended to September 10, 1973, to allow time for the transmittal of necessary
documents. The loan was declared effective on that date.
Ln. No. 936  Power Project; US$25 million of October 5, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
This loan has been made effective on January 23, 1974.
Lii. No. 955  Second highway Project; US$29 million of January 11, 1974;
ClosinL Date: June 30, 1977.
This loan is not yet effective.

Procurement         The project is being executed on a lump sum turnkey basis.
Arrangements:      Bids were invited from consortia of specialized firms
with the leadership entrusted to one firm (the Contractor)
who was to have the responsibility for the entire project.
The Bank agreed to a three phase procedure for selecting
the consortium.
(i) Prequalification of consortia after international
advertising;
(ii) invitation to prequalified consortia to submit
unpriced technical offers conforming to detailed
tender documents; and, after clarification and
technical adjustments of offers;
(iii)  call for a lump sum price for most of the project
work which, together with the technical offer, was
to serve as the basis for bid evaluation.
Five consortia were selected by OCP on the basis of their
technical offers to present price proposals. The lowest
evaluated bid was submitted by the consortium headed by
Friedrich Uhde GmbH (Uhde) of the Federal Republic of
Germany. The contracts include a lump sum price to be
paid according to an agreed schedule corresponding to
expected cash outlays and work done by the Contractor.
Advance pavements in convertible foreign exchange by the
Borrower will be financed retroactively by the lenders.
The share of the Bank will be US$3.1 million.
