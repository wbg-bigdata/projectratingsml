I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND HURRICANE MITCH
A.   Background
1.    Honduras is the third poorest country in the Latin America and Caribbean Region, with
income per capita of $700 million in 1997, over half of its population in poverty, one third in
extreme poverty and relatively weak social indicators. Except for two coastal strips, one
extending about 640 km along the Caribbean Sea and the other 64 km on the Pacific Ocean,
Honduras is a plateau, consisting of broad, fertile plains broken by deep valleys, and traversed by
mountain ranges in a northwestern to southwestern direction. The mountains, which are volcanic
in origin, rise to maximum elevations of more than 2,800 m. Most of the country's rivers drain
toward the north into the Caribbean Sea. Average annual rainfall ranges from 1,016 mm in some
mountain valleys to 2,540 mm along the northern coast. Like its neighbors in Central America,
Honduras, is prone to national disasters, especially hurricanes and earthquakes. Normally, these
hurricanes affect Honduras' Caribbean coast to the north, as was the case with Hurricane Fifi, in
September 1974, which caused extensive damage and loss of life in that part of the country.
2.    On October 24, Tropical Storm Mitch was upgraded to a hurricane that quickly
developed into one of the strongest and most damaging storms ever to hit Central America. At
its height on October 26 and 27, Hurricane Mitch sustained winds of 290 kph and dumped heavy
rains over the region. Although the winds diminished as the hurricane traveled inland over
Honduras on October 30, the storm continued to produce torrential rains, causing catastrophic
floods and landslides. After its slow, destructive march north and west across Honduras and
Guatemala, Mitch dissipated over southeastern Mexico but again gained strength causing
flooding in Florida. Hurricane Mitch is considered the worst natural disaster to have affected
Honduras in modern times. Coming after copious winter rains in the previous weeks, which had
swollen rivers and saturated soils, the hurricane's strong winds and relentless rain caused rivers
to overflow and severe landslides. The sheer length of time that it remained centered over
Honduras, combined with its trajectory, resulted in incredibly heavy damage to all parts of the
country.
B.   Hurricane Damage
3.    Within Central America, Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch. As the stormn
traveled inland, it dumped one year's worth of rain in a few days. The worst damage was in the
Atlantic Coast, Sula Valley, the Central Region and the South, but no part of Honduras escaped
some impact. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 4.8 million people (three of every four
Hondurans) were affected. Unlike previous natural disasters, Hurricane Mitch wreaked havoc in
Honduras' two largest cities, the capital Tegucigalpa, and San Pedro Sula. About 40 percent of
the capital was damaged, half of its 1 million inhabitants were affected, and the city was cut off
from the rest of the country for almost a week. Much of the Government's own institutional
infrastructure was damaged, including destruction of the Ministry of Education and extensive
damage to the Ministry of Finance. San Pedro Sula, the country's industrial and agricultural
heartland, suffered damage to its international airport, road and bridge infrastructure, and its
water and sewerage systems. Estimates of the damage and reconstruction costs were prepared by
working teams of donor representatives and the authorities, coordinated by the Technical
Support Unit (UNAT) of the Ministry of the Presidency. IDA staff in Tegucigalpa assisted the



- 2 -
effort to produce the first damage assessment. A summary of their preliminary estimates is
presented below.
* The Human Cost. Preliminary estimates indicate that about 5,660 people died, but there are
an estimated 8,000 persons missing, suggesting that the total number of deaths could be
substantially higher. As a direct result of the hurricane, an estimated 285,000 people had to
be placed in temporary shelters, including about 85,000 children under 5.
* Transport. Damage to the road network isolated a number of regions in the country,
including the capital. The hurricane damaged or destroyed an estimated 60 percent of main
and secondary paved roads (1,600 km), and 20 percent of unpaved secondary and tertiary
roads (2,390). About 100 bridges (8 in Tegucigalpa) were completely destroyed or suffered
extensive damage.
* Water. Water systems in all major urban areas were damaged. In Tegucigalpa, about 23 km
of the water distribution system were damaged. Damage estimates are still incomplete for
the rest of the country, but the Government estimates that 47 major water systems and 1,500
of the 4,000 rural systems were damaged.
* Energy and Telecommunications. None of the large hydroelectric stations suffered major
damage, but there was considerable damage to substations, and transmission and distribution
lines. The hurricane damaged about 45,000 phone lines.
* Education. The Ministry of Education estimates that 17 percent of the country's 9,548
primary schools were damaged. This implies that unless school repairs are quickly carried
out, or alternative arrangements made, about 100,000 children could be unable to start the
school year in February. About 40 secondary schools were also damaged. In addition, most
educational establishments not affected by the hurricane are being used as temporary
shelters. The Ministry of Education building in Tegucigalpa was completely destroyed,
including all the Ministry's administrative and academic records.
* Health. The majority of hospitals and health centers suffered some damage. Of Honduras'
27 hospitals, 14 were left with no water. At least 4 of these reported extensive infrastructure
damage. Also, 12 hospitals reported damage to their electricity systems. There is little
information on damage to rural health posts and clinics, but it is believed to be extensive.
Unsanitary conditions and contaminated water are placing large parts of the population at
risk of transmitted diseases such as dengue, cholera and leptospirosis.
* Housing. The Government estimates that the hurricane affected the housing conditions of
about 661,760 people (82,720 families). Of these, about 285,000 were evacuated to
temporary shelters and another 396,000 are living in precarious housing. The authorities
estimate that about 33,220 new houses will be needed and about 49,500 will need to be
rehabilitated. These estimates are likely to rise considerably, as more information is
collected from isolated rural areas.
* Agriculture. Most of the basic grains production was lost. This will severely impact poor,
small-scale farmers who are the main producers of basic grains. Export products also



- 3 -
suffered extensive damage, including bananas, shrimp, pineapples, African palm, melons and
other fruits.
* Environment. Some ecologists believe that hurricanes are a natural cycle and are necessary
to thin forests, lower the salinity of coastal waters and scrub underwater reefs and remove
collected debris and pollution. However, the magnitude of Hurricane Mitch and its impact
on some of the same places damaged by extensive forest fires last summer, will likely have a
severe impact on coastal areas and fragile offshore ecosystems. The fires deforested large
mountain areas, and then-absent the trees and undergrowth-torrential rains caused
massive erosion.  Small streams became raging torrents that spilled from  their banks.
carrying with them trees and debris. Thousands of mature trees spilled from the mouths of
rivers into coastal areas on the Caribbean Sea.
4.     Preliminary Estimates of Damage and Replacement Costs. A preliminary estimate
prepared by UNDP and ECLAC (Table 1) suggests total direct and indirect damage of $3.6
billion (equivalent to 74 percent of Honduras' 1997 GDP). Replacement costs are estimated at
$5 billion.

C.    Response to the Hurricane
5.     After the initial shock over the intensity of Hurricane Mitch, the Government activated
the National Emergency Commission (CONE), and an Information and Damage Assessment
Center to coordinate immediate relief efforts and assess damages. CONE and Government teams
worked with the UN system and emergency response teams from IDA and other donors to
determine priorities, channel immediate support and coordinate international assistance. The
Government also put in place mechanisms to provide food and emergency health care to about
285,000 people in approximately 1,000 shelters, much of this with active help from relief
agencies, other Governments and Honduras' own private sector.  In terms of transport
infrastructure, both the Northern corridor between San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, and the



-4 -
Southern corridor between Choluteca and Tegucigalpa were reopened (in some cases using
temporary solutions such as Bailey bridges, or temporary routes around bridges and across the
dryer sectors of river beds) within about a week, reestablishing some road communications
between the capital and parts of the country, and enabling the shipment of food, fuel and
emergency materials to get to the capital. Water service is being reestablished gradually in the
capital and major cities using temporary solutions, such as local wells, and the Government is
trying to acquire materials for the most urgent repairs to the primary and secondary distribution
networks. The Government is also working with the Panamerican Health Organization to
implement a massive vaccination campaign, rehabilitate basic health services and implement a
vector control program.
6.    The international community responded swiftly to the disaster, benefitting from the
emergency response capability of the U.N. and a number of countries. The primary focus was on
rescuing communities, establishing communications, distributing emergency food and medicines
to affected communities, and organizing shelters for displaced populations. There was also a
major task of disposing of the dead, both human and animals, to prevent the spread of disease.
IDA staff on the ground in Honduras moved quickly to help the Government coordinate with
other donors and conduct a preliminary damage assessment.  IDA also reallocated and
restructured existing operations, prepared supplemental credits, and quickly disbursed the second
tranche of the Public Sector Modernization Adjustment Credit and its associated Fifth Dimension
resources (totaling $38 million), which provided much-needed balance of payments support.
11. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF HURRICANE MITCH
A.   Macroeconomic Framework Prior to the Hurricane
7.    Until Hurricane Mitch struck, Honduras' economy had been improving steadily during
the previous two years. Economic growth had rebounded to 4.9 percent in 1997, from 3.7
percent i-n 1996, and was on pace for growth of 5.5 percent in 1998. Average real wages had
increased by about 8 percent in 1997, after no growth the previous two years, and while
underemployment remained significant, open unemployment had fallen slightly to 4 percent in
1997, Annualized inflation fell from 26 percent in 1997 to 13 percent in September 1998.
8.    The consolidated public sector deficit fell to 3 percent of GDP in 1997, from 4.2 percent
in 1996, while public savings increased slightly to 6.1 percent of GDP. In April 1998, the
Government adopted a fiscal package aimed at increasing social spending and promoting private
investment through lower income tax rates to bring them in line with the rest of Central America,
and the phasing out of the net assets tax and export taxes. To meet the fiscal costs associated
with the increased spending and tax reductions, the sales tax rate was increased from 7 to 12
percent. Preliminary data for the first nine months of 1998 indicated that fiscal performance was
in line with a fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP.
9.    The current account deficit fell from 4.6 percent of GDP in 1996 to 2.7 percent in 1997.
In the first nine months of 1998, merchandise exports in dollar terms increased by an estimated
20 percent relative to the same period in 1997, mainly due to strong growth in coffee and
nontraditional exports. Merchandise imports also grew strongly, and the current account deficit
was projected to fall slightly to 2.4 percent of GDP in 1998. Gross international reserves



-5-
increased from $476 million at end-1997 to $515 million at end-September 1998, but fell slightly
in terms of months of imports.
10.   The Governnent was also making steady progress in its structural reform program. This
included: approval of the Telecommunications Law and the Law for Concessioning of Airport
Services in late 1995, which authorized the privatization strategy for these two sectors;,
presentation to the Assembly of the new Civil Aviation Law, which provides a modem
framework for the development of the sector; approval of a new tariff structure for electricity in
1995 and tariff adjustments in 1996 and 1997; approval of the amendments to the General Public
Administration Law in December 1996, which provided the framework for restructuring of
public sector entities; a 14 percent reduction in public employment positions;ad e    e   in
public management, such as decentralization of the procurement function.
11.  In April 1998, the Assembly approved legislation establishing a single regulatory agency
for the electricity sector (a key requirement for establishing a tariff policy consistent with long-
run marginal costs and for facilitating privatization). In August, the Government approved a
strategy for the privatization of electricity distribution, and in September a decree permitting the
start of the bidding process for the privatization of the telecoms company, HONDUTEL, was
passed. The decree complemented the previously-approved privatization law, by strengthening
transparency and accountability provisions in the privatization process to be followed. In late
October, the Government sent to the Assembly draft legislation that would permit concessions to
the private sector for the construction and management of infrastructure projects and encourage
private investment in the mining sector. Measures were also adopted during 1998 to strengthen
the regulatory framework of the financial sector. Prudential banking regulations were issued on
capital adequacy, loan classification requirements, connected lending, and limits on external
borrowing. Other regulations were being prepared to limit the open foreign exchange positions
of commercial banks, establish a deposit insurance system, and regulate the operations of the
stock exchange, insurance companies, and voluntary private pension funds.
B.    Economic Impact
12.   Estimates of the damage to the economy are still being refined. The Authorities estimate
that real GDP growth could drop to 3 percent in 1998 (this modest decrease is because the
hurricane struck late in the calendar year), but would turn negative by at least 2-3 percent in
1999, compared with projected annual growth of 5-6 percent prior to the hurricane.
Unemployment is likely to rise substantially as workers are being laid off in agriculture and
manufacturing pending the reactivation of production. Inflation is expected to increase to 16
percent by December 1998 (13 percent through October) and about 18 percent by end-1999, due
to the relaxation of emergency price controls and shortages of food and other goods. Pre-Mitch
estimates projected a decline in inflation from 15 percent in 1998 to about 10 percent in 1999.
13.   Preliminary estimates indicate that the overall deficit of the Central Government could
widen to 4 percent of GDP in 1998 and to 8 percent or more in 1999, from 2.5 percent projected
prior to the hurricane. The higher deficit would be financed largely by external grants and
credits. Central Government current revenue (excluding grants) is expected to fall to 16.7
percent of GDP in 1998 and 14.4 percent in 1999, compared with about 17.7 percent projected
prior to the hurricane. This would reflect mainly the impact of lower growth on revenues from
the income, sales, and petroleum taxes. Import duties are also expected to fall due to damage to



- 6 -
customs posts, and temporary duty exemptions on imports of food, raw materials, and equipment
to support the rehabilitation and reconstruction effort. Primary expenditures of the Central
Government are expected to increase by 3 percentage points of GDP in 1998 and 4 percentage
points in 1999, relative to levels contemplated in the budget, due to additional spending
requirements related to emergency relief, and reconstruction needs.

14.    Commercial banks and other financial institutions are expected to be affected by
hurricane-related losses experienced by major borrowers, that will require the restructuring of
some loans and write-offs of others. An assessment of the losses and measures to deal with them
is being carried out by the Banking Commission, with the assistance of the IMF and IDA. At
this time, the Central Bank is not considering special lines of credit to the banks to deal with the
effects of the disaster, but is encouraging the banks to deal with their clients on a case-by-case.
The Government is discussing with NGOs and the agriculture development bank (BANADESA)
mechanisms to support the reestablishment of rural credit schemes.
15.    The current account deficit is expected to widen to about 8 percent of GDP in 1998 and
in 1999 (compared to under 3 percent estimated prior to Mitch), owing mainly to the projected
fall in exports and higher imports associated with the reconstruction effort and the rebuilding of
inventories. Rough estimates indicate a financing gap of about $500 million (about 10 percent of
GDP) in 1999. The estimate for 1999 takes into account about $290 million in insurance
proceeds (to Honduran insurance companies reinsured outside the country), but excludes the
effects of possible flow rescheduling of obligations coming due to Paris Club creditors. The
Government expects to fill the 1999 financing gap through the reprogramming of existing credits
(mainly from IDA and IDB), disbursements of new grants and credits, emergency balance of
payments support from IDA and the IMF, and further debt relief, including disbursements under
the recently-established Central America Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF) to cover the servicing
of multilateral debt.
C. Government Measures
16.   The Government is taking steps to limit the effects of the disaster on inflation and interest
rates, and setting the stage for economic recovery. A revised Central Government budget for
1999 is being prepared to take account of the changed outlook for revenues and expenditures.



- 7 -
The Government aims to limit domestic financing to about 1 percent of GDP in 1998-99, in part
by reallocating spending to emergency needs and seeking concessional financing and grants to
meet its reconstruction needs. Monetary policy will aim to limit inflation by containing the
growth of the money supply. In the external sector, the Government will aim to maintain
confidence in the exchange rate system by continuing to hold regular auctions, allowing the
exchange rate to fluctuate within the band, and maintaining a minimum level of gross
international reserves equivalent to about 3 months of imports.
17.   On the structural front, the calendar for privatization of the telecoms company and the
electricity sector, as well as the concessioning of airports, are under review, pending a full
assessment of damages and the rehabilitation needs. IFC is discussing with the Government
possible support to keep the privatization of the telecoms company on track. The Banking
Commission will maintain close supervision over the financial system, in particular by
continuing with its program of on-site supervision supported by IDA and the IMF, and assessing
the effects of the disaster on loan portfolios and insurance companies, some of which have been
seriously affected by the hurricane damage.
18.   The Government plans to resume discussions in mid-January 1999, aimed at finalizing an
economic program that could be supported by an ESAF. The Authorities believe that an ESAF-
supported program, aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability, improving the climate for
foreign investors, and deepening structural reforms, would be essential to restore confidence in
the economy and support the recovery. They also see this as an essential step toward Honduras'
eventual inclusion under the HIPC initiative.
III. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
A.   IDA Strategy
19.   At the time the hurricane struck, IDA had its Central America transport team, a mission
working with the IMF on the debt sustainability analysis and the Policy Framework Paper (PFP),
and the staff of its Liaison Office in Tegucigalpa. They formed the core of IDA's emergency
response team, supplemented by disaster specialists and other task managers who traveled to the
country as soon as physical conditions permitted. Immediate needs included helping the
Government to assess damage, prioritize interventions, and coordinate with other external
donors. This effort has included IFC staff, who have been coordinating with the country team in
headquarters, and have traveled to Honduras to review with the Government and the private
sector ways to assist them deal with the effects of the hurricane, and possible support to keep the
Government's privatization program on track. FIAS is also discussing with the Government
possible support for a foreign investment promotion strategy, and MIGA has indicated its
willingness to work closely with the Government to help in mobilizing private investment for the
recovery and reconstruction. In the process, IDA has prepared its own three-part strategy to
assist Honduras respond to this natural disaster.
* Emergency Financing, Macroeconomic Assistance and Debt Relief. The Government has
an urgent need for emergency financing of critical imports, while sustaining macroeconomic
stability. The proposed fast-track Hurricane Emergency Project (HEP) would meet this



- 8 -
immediate need. It complements actions by IDA in the two weeks following the hurricane to
release the second tranche of the Public Sector Modernization Adjustment Credit and
associated Fifth Dimension resources, which also provided balance of payments support at a
critical juncture. Considering the emergency in Honduras, the Board approved that action on
a no-objection basis in three days, rather than the standard ten. IDA staff have also been
cooperating with the IMF on a preliminary reassessment of Honduras' macroeconomic
situation. Finally, at the request of a several governments, IDA has established a Central
America Emergency Trust Fund (CAETF) to which contributions are being made to support
Honduras, and other hurricane-affected countries cover multilateral debt service payments.
As soon as conditions permit, IDA and the IMF, in consultation with the IDB, will carry out
a comprehensive debt sustainability analysis which would determine Honduras' eligibility for
the HIPC initiative.
* Short- to Medium-Term  Rehabilitation.  IDA  staff are working with counterpart
Government agencies and other development partners to reprogram IDA operations and/or
process supplemental financing to provide for urgent rehabilitation of damaged social and
economic infrastructure. Given the extent of the damage and the need for quick support,
IDA staff believe that reprogramming of the existing portfolio-as opposed to designing a
new, multi-sector hurricane rehabilitation project-is the fastest and most flexible way to
meet Honduras' short-term rehabilitation needs, given that speed is of the essence. Based on
preliminary damage estimates, we anticipate that several ongoing IDA operations would be
restructured within existing credit amounts to finance about $70 million of rehabilitation-
related expenditures. In addition, supplemental funding will be proposed for ongoing health
and transport projects, in the amounts of $10 and $20, respectively. These figures may
change as work with Government counterparts and other donors continues and as medium-
term rehabilitation needs are better defined.
L Longer-Term Reconstruction. A new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was under
preparation at the time that Hurricane Mitch struck Honduras. Up to that point, IDA had held
CAS discussions in which it had agreed with the Government on the primary objectives and
likely lending and non-lending services. It had also initiated a dialogue with representatives
of civil society and was about to formalize the consultation process on the proposed CAS,
which was scheduled to be presented to the Board in February 1999. The new CAS under
preparation did not propose a major change with respect to the strategy of the previous CAS,
but rather a shift in emphasis, placing greater focus on human capital, targeted poverty
interventions, rural development, environment, and institutional strengthening. In the social
sectors, discussions were well advanced on IDA support to pilot a community-based
education model (along the successful EDUCO model in El Salvador) and improved health
care quality through decentralization. The social safety net would also be strengthened by
supporting successful pilot initiatives by the Social Investment Fund targeting women,
indigenous groups, municipal strengthening and rural credit. In rural development, we were
working with the Government on a broad agenda to support rural growth and poverty
alleviation, including support for land titling, a land fund and an assessment of options in the
design of a viable rural credit system to benefit small, poor farmers. On the environment, we
planned to complement work under the GEF-funded Meso-American Biological Corridor
project with an operation to protect the Coral Reef, and as part of a regional initiative, had
planned work on disaster prevention and mitigation. Institutional strengthening would be an



-9-
over-riding objective, including support for improved governance and transparency,
decentralization and strengthening of local governments, and economic management. In
terms of structural reforms, we had started work with the Central Bank on strengthening the
prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system, and support for pension reform.
20.   The extent of the economic and social devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch calls for a
fundamental review of Honduras' future development strategy. While long-term development
objectives of poverty reduction, sustainable and equitable private sector-led growth,
environmental protection, strengthening of the financial system, and modernization of the state
may not have changed, the pace and sequencing efforts in all sectors have necessarily been
affected by the hurricane. Therefore, the draft CAS will need to be reformulated to support the
longer-term reconstruction of Honduras. While the priorities on which we were working are
likely to remain valid, and we propose that IDA remain heavily engaged in the social sectors and
rural poverty, issues that will have to be addressed include the possible need to direct a larger
volume of resources toward infrastructure rehabilitation, especially transport and water
(depending on the support forthcoming from other donors), and toward work on the financial
system and private sector development. The share of the country program devoted to quick-
disbursing balance of payments support will also necessarily increase beginning with the
proposed HEP. Strengthening the country's institutional capacity for disaster preparedness and
management will be very important, and the emphasis on decentralization and local partnerships
which is already a strong feature of our portfolio will become more important than even in the
recovery process. Finally, the role of other parts of the Bank Group in supporting private sector
development is likely to expand.
B.    Project Objectives
21.   The proposed Hurricane Emergency Project is part of the first phase of IDA's strategy to
assist in the recovery and reconstruction of Honduras (para. 19). It would assist the Government
in maintaining macroeconomic stability through financing of imports associated with rebuilding
social and economic infrastructure, and reestablishing production levels in response to the
damage caused by Hurricane Mitch. The performance of the project would be measured by how
well Honduras maintains macroeconomic stability in 1999 and beyond, especially in terms of the
current account deficit and the budget deficit of the Central Government.
C.    Project Description
22.   The Hurricane Emergency Project will provide immediate, quick-disbursing support to
finance a positive list of imports needed for the rehabilitation effort while supporting
macroeconomic objectives. While the proposed credit would be entirely quick-disbursing, it is
only one part of an unbundled set of actions by the Bank Group to respond to the effects of the
hurricane. The project will, inter alia, provide assistance for imports of: (i) construction
materials and equipment, water, land and air transport vehicles, petroleum, and fuel products that
are needed for rehabilitation of physical infrastructure; (ii) seeds, fertilizers, agricultural
equipment, materials, machinery and fuel needed to reestablish agricultural production; (iii)
medical supplies and equipment needed to replenish stocks of hospitals, health centers, health
posts and outreach programs; (iv) school supplies and equipment for educational facilities that
were damaged or destroyed; and (v) machinery, spare parts and equipment for commercial and
industrial companies.



- 10-
23.   The size of the proposed credit at SDR 144.3 million ($200 million equivalent) is based
on the Government's request for emergency assistance and an assessment of the adverse effects
of Hurricane Mitch on the balance of payments after taking account of the assistance expected
from the IMF, IDB, and other donors.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS/PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.   Project Organization and Management
24.   Project implementation arrangements have been streamlined to conform to the emergency
nature of IDA's assistance. In addressing IDA's fiduciary responsibilities, IDA has sought to
ensure that: credit proceeds are administered prudently, and only used to finance imports of
items included on the positive list; required procurement, accounting and auditing procedures are
followed, and appropriate retention of documents is provided to allow for IDA supervision and
independent audits.
25.   The Project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance, with the assistance of the
Central Bank of Honduras. The execution of an Implementation Agreement, satisfactory to IDA,
defining the assistance to be provided by the Central Bank of Honduras is a condition of
effectiveness. The Ministry of Finance will provide the basic information on imports (based on
Customs Declarations) and the National Division of Customs will maintain the respective
supporting documentation. The credit will finance 100 percent of the delivered cost of eligible
imports, excluding import duties and taxes, subject to a positive list agreed with Government
(Attachment 1). The Central Bank will prepare Statements of Expenditure in an agreed format
based on the information received from the Ministry of Finance through its National Division of
Customs.
B.   Procurement
26.   Credit proceeds would be made available to finance public and private sector imports
against documentation evidencing that the imported goods were both on the positive list and
procured following agreed procurement procedures. Imports financed with credit proceeds
would be limited to goods from eligible countries as per the Bank's Procurement Guidelines
(Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995, revised
January and August 1996, and September 1997). No more than 50 percent of the credit would be
used to finance the import of any category of eligible imports on the positive list. In order to
avoid excessive transaction costs for IDA, public and private sector import contracts of less than
$20,000 would not be eligible for financing with credit proceeds.
27.   The credit would be used to finance only imports procured in accordance with the
procedures presented in Table 3 below. All procurement of imports by the private sector of $3
million or above will be based on Simplified International Competitive Bidding Procedures
subject to prior review by IDA. Imports by the private sector less than the equivalent of $3
million will be acquired based on established commercial practices and will not need the prior
review of IDA



28.   Public sector imports financed under this project would follow Simplified International
Competitive Bidding procedures, as provided under IDA's Procurement Guidelines (Clauses
2.63 and 2.64). Contracts let by the public sector of $1 million or above will be subject to prior
review by IDA. However, to facilitate the speedy import of items required immediately for the
recovery effort, public sector imports of less than $1 million equivalent and awarded between
October 25, 1998 and June 30, 1999 may be made based on international shopping procedures as
per IDA's Procurement Guidelines (Clauses 3.5 and 3.6). The Project would finance the import
of fuel and fertilizers by both private and public importers through established international
commodity markets, or through simplified procurement procedures provided for under the IDA's
Procurement Guidelines.

C.   Disbursements
29.   The proceeds of the credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the delivered cost of
imports, excluding imports duties and taxes, subject to the agreed positive list.  Mo
disbursements would be made for used or luxury goods, or for military equipment.



- 12-
Disbursements in respect of expenditures under contracts for goods procured by the public sector
costing less than $1 million equivalent and under contracts for goods for the private sector
costing less than $3 million equivalent and for commonly traded commodities would be made
against Statements of Expenditures, for which supporting documentation would be retained by
the National Division of Customs and made available for review by IDA financial management
and procurement specialists and project auditors. The project would be implemented over a one-
year period and is expected to be completed by December 31. 1999. The Closing Date for this
credit would be June 30, 2000.
30.   Retroactive Financing. Retroactive financing in the amount of SDR 28.86 million, 20
percent of the credit amount, would be provided to finance expenditures incurred before loan
signing but after October 24, 1998. the approximate date of onset of devastation caused by
Hurricane Mitch.
31.   Special Account. The Borrower may request disbursement through a US Dollar Special
Account to be established in the Central Bank of Honduras, with an initial authorized allocation
of $50 million, 25 percent of the total credit amount. The Special Account would be replenished
as and when needed to ensure timely disbursements of funds to cover eligible imports.
D.    Financial Management and Monitoring
32.   The Central Bank of Honduras has in place an appropriate mechanism to monitor and
report on the financial transactions pertaining to this operation. The Ministry of Finance would
provide at all times adequate staff for managing the Project and maintaining proper accounts and
records. The Central Bank will prepare quarterly reports on the financial transactions related to
the project within such period. Such reports will be provided to the Ministry of Finance within
15 days of the end of each quarter. The quarterly financial reports will reflect the total transfers
of resources of the credit and show the total of eligible financed imports based on the agreed
positive list (corresponding to the lists of imports provided by the National Division of
Customs).
33.   Quarterly progress reports of monitoring indicators, the Project's financial transactions,
and quarterly audits of project accounts, the Special Account and Statements of Expenditures by
an independent private accounting firm acceptable to IDA, will be provided by the Ministry of
Finance within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. The fourth quarter audit report will
present the cumulative balances to the end of the year. The retaining of an auditing firm
acceptable to IDA is a condition of effectiveness.
34.   The Project's monitoring indicators are described in Attachment 2. Quarterly reports on
the progress against these macroeconomic indicators will be prepared and sent to IDA within 30
days of the close of each quarter.

Monitoring Indicators
The objective of the Hurricane Emergency Project is to assist the Republic of Honduras
to finance critical imports needed for the rehabilitation and rebuilding effort while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The following preliminary indicators would be used to monitor
macroeconomic stability:
* The balance of payments current account deficit expected not to exceed 8 percent of GDP in
1999; and
The overall fiscal deficit of the Central Government expected not to exceed 8 percent of GDP
in 1999.
These indicators would be adjusted accordingly, as macroeconomic estimates and projections
are refined, as reflected in the subsequent Government economic program.
