REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO INDIA FOR THE
SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$150 million on
standard IDA terms, to help finance a project for the construction of the
first phase of a proposed 2,000 MW thermal power station. The proceeds of
the credit would be relent by the Government to the National Thermal Power
Corporation, Ltd., for 20 years, including five years' grace, at an effective
interest rate of 10-1/4% per annum.

PART I - THE ECONOMY-
2.        An economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects of India"
(1073-IN dated March 29, 1976), was distributed to the Executive Directors
on April 2, 1976. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
Background
3.        India is exceptional among the Bank Group's member countries for
its size and diversity; the country is divided into more than 20 States with
a population of some 600 million and over 60 languages. The country's poverty
and inadequate domestic savings, together with a net transfer of external
resources averaging over the past five years only about US$1.20 per person
per annum, have imposed sharp limitations on the rate of growth. Account must
be taken, also, of the uncertainties imposed by the erratic availability of
water. A bad monsoon, which is likely to occur about two years out of every
five, has a pervasive influence over the entire economy and can wipe out the
results of years of efforts. Thus, the annual growth of national income over
the last five years (1971/72 - 1975/76), which included two consecutive mon-
soon failures, has averaged only 2% per annum, less than the rate of popula-
tion increase.
4.        Since Independence, progress has been impressive on many fronts,
but disappointing on others, and generally has fallen short of India's mas-
sive needs. The growth of the socio-economic infrastructure (transport,
education, health services, etc.) has been impressive, but has often been
achieved at high cost and has yielded results of variable quality. Many
industrial and agricultural investment schemes have been highly successful,
but others have taken excessively long to be completed and have operated
well below full capacity. In some regions of the country, growth and struc-
tural change have been rapid and compare favorably with developments in many
1/   Parts I and II of this report are the same as Parts I and II of
the President's Report on the Kerala Agricultural Development Project
(Report No. P-1953-IN), dated February 3, 1977.

other parts of the world, but in other regions there has been stagnation and
possibly even decline. Although national income has increased in most years,
there has been in general little impact upon the living standards of the vast
masses of the urban and rural population. In recent years, the Government
has initiated a variety of programs specifically directed toward helping the
lower income strata, which - conservatively measured - consist of some 200
million people with incomes of less than US$60 per head per year.
5.        The structure of the economy has been slow to change.   Agriculture
remains the dominant sector, with its share of national product declining
only gradually from about 50% to 42% over the last twenty years. The share
of industry has increased only slowly and, since the late 1960s, has remained
approximately constant at about 23%. There has, however, been a shift in the
composition of industrial production, with consumer, intermediate, and capital
goods now contributing about one third each, compared with an overwhelming
preponderance of consumer goods 25 years ago.
Recent Trends
6.        India entered 1975/76 having been through one of the most difficult
periods since Independence. Progress in dealing with long-term development
problems had been limited by poor crops, the dramatic shifts against India in
the terms of trade, and inflation. Adjustments to these immediate difficul-
ties thus became the principal preoccupation in economic management. However,
with the support of favorable weather and additional foreign assistance, it
now appears that India has successfully weathered the problems of the recent
past; once again there is the basis for an upturn in the growth rate of the
economy.
7.        Most important among the favorable factors have been a bumper har-
vest which followed years of poor or modest agricultural output. Foodgrain
production in 1975/76, estimated at around 117 million tons, exceeded the
previous record of 1970/71 by 8%. Oilseeds, sugarcane and cotton also reached
new production peaks and provided ample supplies for the agro-industries. In
1976/77 a good harvest is again expected of at least 110 million tons of food-
grains. Secondly, deficiencies in the supply of basic commodities and of in-
frastructural inputs such as energy and transport, which had been prevalent in
the past, have been eased. Electricity generation and domestic production of
coal, oil, cement and steel all increased by over 10% during 1975/76 and by a
further 15% in the first eight months of 1976/77. Finally, the increased
supply of agricultural and industrial products and of services, together with
the demand restraint imposed by the Government since mid-1974, put a virtual
stop to inflation. From April 1975 to March 1976 the Wholesale Price Index
fell by 8.1%. Although from April to September 1976 the Index rose by 11%,
it was still 5% lower in September 1976 than in September 1974.
8.        On the balance of payments front there have been a number of en-
couraging developments. Firstly, the rapid build-up of foodgrain stocks to
a level of 17 million tons by December 1976 provides a buffer against the
impact of a future crop failure on the balance of payments and has reduced
current import requirements. Secondly, despite generally unfavorable world



- 3 -
trading conditions, export earnings rose by 9% in 1975/76, and seem likely to
rise by more than this in 1976/77. Thirdly, the value of petroleum imports
was stabilized in 1975/76 (although there is likely to be a rise in 1976/77),
and steel imports have been progressively reduced in 1975/76 and 1976/77 as
a result of increased domestic production. Finally, increased production
and lowered world prices have reduced fertilizer import values quite sharply.
As a result of these factors, imports rose only 5% in value in 1975/76 and
the trade deficit fell by almost $100 million. Developments so far in 1976/
77 suggest a more dramatic improvement in the trade balance this year. More-
over, since net aid rose 49% in 1975/76 and India received substantial in-
flows of private remittances during the past one and a half years, reserves
rose by almost $800 million in 1975/76, and are continuing to rise at a com-
parable rate in 1976/77. These reserves give India added flexibility in
adjusting to a higher rate of growth in the future.
Development Prospects
9.        While many of the most acute problems were eased during 1975/76,
longer-term constraints to growth remain. Many of these have existed for
some time, but their importance had been temporarily overshadowed by the more
overwhelming limitations imposed by supply shortages and balance of payments
problems. One such constraint is the deficiency of demand for a large seg-
ment of the manufacturing industry. Consequently, in the midst of adequate
supplies during 1975/76, the use of manufacturing capacity - especially for
consumer durables - remained low. In the short and medium term, the two most
promising ways of stimulating demand are to boost public investment and ex-
pand exports. Both avenues are currently being pursued by the Government.
During 1975/76, real Plan outlay rose by 18-20%, after having fallen during
each of the previous two years. The 1976/77 Budget proposed a further in-
crease of 16% in real terms and introduced new measures to stimulate invest-
ment in the private sector. Investment priorities remained the same as in
1975/76, namely agricultural development and increased production of critical
industrial inputs, such as power, coal, oil, and iron and steel.    The Budget
also stressed the importance of exports as an essential condition for sus-
tained stability in the balance of payments.
10.       In agriculture, the basic problem remains that, despite the record
foodgrain crop in 1975/76, the long-term growth rate of foodgrain production
in India has been unacceptably low, at about 2.3% per annum over the last 15
years. This is about the same as the rate of population increase. Starting
from a situation of deficit, this has meant that only in good years has there
been a significant margin of production to cater to any per capita growth in
consumption, and even in normal years it has been necessary to rely on stocks
or imports to meet any growth in demand. With a major effort to expand the
irrigated area and provide complementary inputs, the average growth rate of
foodgrain production could be substantially increased. This is essential,
not only because of the necessity to meet food requirements without unmanage-
able consequences for the balance of payments but also because of the strong
influence of agriculture on the levels of activity in other sectors of the
economy. Even with a higher growth rate of foodgrain production, imports
will still be required. However, in relation to India's total consumption of



- 4 -
foodgrains, the dependence on imports has been and will remain small. In the
past, domestic production has accounted for almost 100% of supplies in good
weather years and about 90% when harvests were poor.
11.       The energy sector in India was characterized by shortages even
before the international oil crisis developed. The dramatic hike in oil
prices, coinciding as it did with the accentuation of electric power
shortages - caused in part by low hydroelectric generation due to poor
monsoons - led to an acceleration of measures to improve performance of
existing facilities and to a much higher priority for investments in the
energy sector. The effects of these measures, aided by the good monsoon, are
now starting to be felt. Coal production has increased by 10% or more in each
of the last two years, and, partly as a result of this, power shortages and
restrictions have been greatly reduced. The medium-term prospects for oil and
natural gas have improved with the delineation of the offshore Bombay High
field. Crude production from this field is expected to be 1 million tons in
1976/77 and to reach 6 million tons by the end of the Plan period. On this
basis, petroleum imports are projected to start declining in 1978/79, as
increased crude production and expanded refinery output more than offset
increases in demand.
12.       In the past, export growth was affected in varying degrees by in-
adequate profitability, lack of access to imported inputs, poor quality,
instability of the policy environment and vulnerability to ad hoc decisions.
In addition, for agricultural commodities export taxes were significant.
For some homogeneous commodities, such as iron ore and tea, inadequate sup-
plies or limited world demand have been important constraints. In recent
years, mainly because of the large trade deficit, the Government's emphasis
on export promotion has intensified. As a result, although the fundamental
orientation of India's industrial and trade policy and the specific instru-
ments of the export regime have, by and large, remained the same, a signi-
ficant shift in emphasis and in the way these policies are operated has oc-
curred. These are likely to lead to a better utilization of current export
potential and reflect a willingness to make policy adjustments, when neces-
sary, to expand exports.
13.       While it is difficult to assess the impact of the new measures in
an area where policy is already very complex, some improvement has already
taken place and further improvement in medium-term performance seems likely.
An annual real export growth rate of over 7% should be feasible, compared
to an average of 5% over the last five years. However, to achieve a higher
export growth over the long run, more far-reaching policy measures will be
required, including the introduction of a more uniform and more stable sys-
tem of export incentives. Even so, the export drive might be impeded by
controls in some developed markets.
14.       India's balance of payments problems should be manageable over
the next few years, even with the repayment obligations resulting from re-
cent short-term OPEC and IMF borrowings. The worldwide inflation has bene-
fitted India by reducing the proportion of export earnings that have to be



- 5 -
devoted to debt service. India's debt service ratio has come down from 31%
in 1970/71 to 17% in 1975/76. Provided the real growth of exports remains at
about 7% per annum, the debt service ratio is unlikely to rise much above
20% in the foreseeable future. On the import side, given the adequate level
of stocks on hand at the end of 1975/76 and assuming normal weather condi-
tions, annual foodgrain imports could be kept to 5-6 million tons during the
next three years. Within the general category of non-food imports, India
has substantial medium-term import substitution opportunities for three
major items -- petroleum, fertilizer and steel -- which constituted more
than 60% of imports in 1975/76. If the medium-term targets for production in
these areas are achieved, the total expenditure on these three import items
in 1978/79 need not be any higher than in 1975/76 and could quite conceiva-
bly be less. Provided the Government is willing to liberalize imports and
donors continue to respond to India's needs, the easing in the external
payments situation presents an opportunity to raise the level of investment
(complemented by larger imports of capital goods, components, and raw
materials) and, consequently, reach a more satisfactory level of long-term
growth.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
15.       Since 1949, the Bank Group has made 49 loans and 80 development
credits to India totalling US$1,751 million and US$4,112 million (both net
of cancellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$785 million has been
repaid, and US$1,651 million was still undisbursed as of December 31, 1976.
Annex II contains a summary statement of disbursements as of December 31,
1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Since 1957, IFC has made 14 commitments in India totaling US$58.4
million, of which US$11.9 million has been repaid, US$7.6 million sold and
US$6.9 million cancelled. Of the balance of US$32.0 million, US$25.5 mil-
lion represents loans and US$6.5 million equity. A summary statement of IFC
operations as of December 31, 1976, is also included in Annex II (page 2).
17.       In recent years, the emphasis of Bank Group lending has been on
agriculture. The Bank Group has been particularly active in supporting minor
irrigation and other on-farm investments through agricultural credit opera-
tions. Major irrigation, marketing, seed development, and dairying are other
agricultural activities supported by the Bank Group. Also, the Bank Group
has been active in financing the expansion of output in the fertilizer sector
and, through its sizeable assistance to development finance institutions, in
a wide range of geographically scattered medium- and small-scale industrial
enterprises. IDA financing of industrial raw materials and components for
selected priority sectors has been instrumental in facilitating better capac-
ity utilization in industry. The Bank Group has also been active in support-
ing infrastructure development for power, telecommunications, and railways.
Family planning, education, water supply development, and urban investments
have also received Bank Group support in recent years.



- 6 -
18.       The direction of assistance under the Bank/IDA program has been
consistent with India's needs and the Government's priorities. Projects
designed to foster agricultural production through the provision of essential
inputs such as credit for on-farm investments, command area development of
existing irrigation schemes, intensification and streamlining of extension
systems, and seed production form an important aspect of the Bank Group's
program for the next several years. Special emphasis will be given to proj-
ects benefitting small farmers. Projects supporting urban water supply and
sewerage and urban transport also form an integral part of the Bank's lending
strategy to India for the next several years. Lending in support of infra-
structure and industrial investments will focus on agriculture-, export- and
energy-related projects.
19.       The need for a substantial net transfer of external resources in
support of India's economy has been a recurrent theme of Bank economic re-
ports and of the discussions within the India Consortium. Thanks in large
part to the response of the aid community, India has successfully adjusted
to the changed world price situation. However, the basic need for readily
usable foreign exchange assistance, to augment domestic resources, stimulate
investment and accelerate economic growth, remains. Bank Group lending for
critical industrial raw materials and components is likely to continue to
be an element within the overall program of assistance. As in the past, Bank
Group assistance for projects in India should include, as appropriate, the
financing of local expenditures. India imports relatively few capital goods
because of the capacity of the domestic capital goods industry. The import
component of projects tends to be especially low in such high-priority areas
as agriculture, education, urban development and family planning. For the
Bank Group to be able to make an appropriate contribution to the financing of
projects in these sectors, it is important to cover a proportion of local
expenditures.
20.       It is clear from the review of the Indian economy that as much as
possible of India's external capital requirements should be provided on con-
cessionary terms. Accordingly, the bulk of the Bank Group assistance to
India has been, and should continue to be, provided from IDA. However, the
amount of IDA funds that can reasonably be allocated to India remains small
in relation to India's needs for external support, and some Bank lending
to India, for which the country is creditworthy, is appropriate. As of
December 31, 1976, the loans to India held by the Bank totaled US$988 million,
of which US$510 million remained to be disbursed, leaving a net amount out-
standing of US$478 million.
21.       Of the external assistance received by India, the proportion con-
tributed by the Bank Group has grown significantly. In 1969/70, the Bank
Group accounted for 34% of total commitments, 13% of gross disbursements,
and 12% of net disbursements as compared with an estimated 58%, 24% and 29%,
respectively, in 1975/76. On March 31, 1976, India's outstanding and dis-
bursed external public debt was US$13.1 billion, of which the Bank Group's
share was 25%. The Bank Group's share is expected to remain around this level
in the future. Because Bank Group assistance to India is predominantly in the



form of IDA credits, debt service to the Bank Group will rise slowly. In
1975/76, about 15% of India's total debt service payments were to the Bank
Group.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Developments in the Power Sector
22.       India's installed power generating capacity increased at an aver-
age annual rate of 10% over the 20-year period from the end of 1950, while
gross electricity generation grew at 11.6%. In recent years, however, demand
has been considerably greater than available supply, with the result that
the power sector has been characterized by local and intermittent shortages.
This situation has been due to a lack of adequate planning, delays in the
implementation of new generation projects, the lateness or inadequacy of
additions to transmission and distribution facilities, and operation and
maintenance problems.
23.       In the early 1970s, the power supply situation became critical,
since the basic inadequacy of the system was exacerbated by the failure of
two successive monsoons, leading to lower output from hydro plants, and by
interruption in coal supplies for the power sector, which had an adverse
impact on thermal generation. As a result in 1973/74 and 1974/75 power
generation increased by only just over 3% p.a. However in 1976, there was
a marked improvement with generation increasing by 13.5%. This increase has
been achieved through the commissioning of new capacity, improved hydro capa-
city utilization due to a good monsoon, better utilization of existing thermal
plant and further interconnection of transmission facilities in state and
regional grids. Even so, power shortages continue in many areas. With poten-
tial demand exceeding likely supply for some considerable time, the task be-
fore the Ministry of Energy, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and the
State Electricity Boards (SEBs) is to improve utilization and commission new
capacity efficiently and quickly.
24.       Installed capacity at the end of the Fourth Plan period (March 1974)
was 16,700 MW, excluding about 1,800 MW of non-utility capacity. This had in-
creased to about 20,000 MW by March 1976 and the revised Fifth Plan envisages
a utility capacity of about 29,200 MW by the end of the Plan period (March
1979). New generating facilities, the construction of most of which must
commence during the Fifth Plan period for commissioning by the end of the Sixth
Plan (March 1984), are expected to total 20,000 MW, of which about 13,500 MW
(including 500 MW of nuclear) would be thermal and the balance hydro. The ex-
pansion and reinforcement of the transmission network in step with generating
plant additions is also being planned, and about 15,000 circuit km of 400 kV
transmission lines are expected to be constructed by March 1984.
25.       In view of the immense task of providing sufficient generating
capacity to meet the requirements of the Sixth Plan period, the Central Gov-
ernment proposes to supplement the efforts of the States by constructing a



- 8 -
number of-large Centrally owned and operated generating stations. For this
purpose, two Central generating companies, one for hydro and the other for
thermal plant (the National Hydro Power Corporation and the National Thermal
Power Corporation), were established in November 1975 with authority to design,
construct, own and operate generating and transmission facilities and to supply
power in bulk directly to neighboring States.
Bank Group Operations in the Power Sector
26.       The Bank Group's involvement in the power sector began in the 1950s.
Initially, the Bank Group provided assistance for generation projects. Sub-
sequently the focus has been on strengthening high voltage transmission facil-
ities and, more recently, has included rural electrification. Fifteen loans
and credits totalling US$625.5 million have been approved for the sector.
The Bank Group has been involved in continuing efforts to improve the perform-
ance of SEBs. More recently, special attention has been paid to the problems
of co-ordination at the national level.
Bank Group Experience with SEBs
27.       One loan and three credits have been approved for power transmis-
sion, the last of which (Credit 604-IN) was approved in December 1975. They
have provided funds for the transmission programs of the SEBs and it is under
them that the Bank Group has sought to assist the SEBs in improving their
performance.
28.       Historically the financial management of the SEBs has been poor; in
particular, and financial returns have been adversely affected by the failure
to relate tariffs to costs. The situation has been gradually improving and is
under continuing review. Under the power transmission credits, SEBs were
expected to work towards a rate of return target of 9-1/2%. By 1977/78, it
is expected that ten SEBs, out of a total of 18, will achieve this target, and
a further five SEBs should do so in 1978/79. As these rates of return are
computed on historical asset values, these achievements represent only a first
step toward the SEBs' generating sufficient funds to finance a reasonable
portion of new investment.
29.       Tariffs have been complicated and unrelated to marginal costs.    A
Bank staff analysis of Andhra Pradesh showed that a reform of pricing at the
SEB level is necessary if wasteful consumption of energy is to be avoided.
Steps have been taken to simplify the structure and raise the level of elec-
tricity tariffs in that state. Several other SEBs are now carrying out similar
studies of their own pricing policies. Further, the principle of marginal
cost pricing to be adopted for bulk supplies from the Singrauli project should
also encourage the recipient SEBs to adjust their own tariffs to reflect eco-
nomic costs. In the context of the financial position of the SEBs in general,
the Bank Group has sought modifications of the financial aspects of the Elec-
tricity (Supply) Act, 1948, and an important amendment, which has already been
approved by the Cabinet and which we are assured will be enacted into law
after the necessary legislative drafting process, will require that tariffs
be set to ensure that revenues will at least meet operating expenses,
depreciation and interest.



- 9 -
30.       A particular problem encountered under the transmission credits
was slow disbursement. This stemmed from the considerable difficulties
which SEBs faced in preparing bid documents and, in some cases, difficulties
in supply. These difficulties have been largely overcome, and disbursements
are accelerating.
Co-ordination in the Power Sector
31.       The Indian power sector is within the concurrent jurisdiction of the
Central Government and the State Governments. The Electricity (Supply) Act,
1948, assigns extensive responsibilities to the State authorities, but it
also provides for broad guidance and coordination from the Center. In 1950
the Central Electricity Authority was set up to be responsible for developing
a national policy for power development and for coordinating the activities
of the various planning agencies involved in electricity supply. However,
without any staff of its own and with no clear and accepted function to per-
form, it was never effective. At the same time, the need for coordination at
the national level has increased as the potential for generating capacity is
developed in certain states to the point where transfers of power between
states and regions has become a feasible proposition. The advent of nuclear
and large thermal units has only served to emphasize the urgency of fulfilling
this need. Accordingly, the Government and the Bank Group have given atten-
tion to ways in which CEA could be developed into an effective national orga-
nization, bearing in mind the responsibilities in this sector already devolved
upon the State Governments. Protracted discussions have taken place with GOI
on this subject and important changes began to be made in October 1974, when
responsibility for the power sector was placed in a newly constituted Ministry
of Energy, which was also placed in charge of the coal mining industry. Fol-
lowing the establishment of the Ministry of Energy, the functions of the
erstwhile Central Water and Power Commission were divided, with its power
functions transferred to the CEA, reporting to the Ministry of Energy. An
order dated August 12, 1975, promulgated by the President of India, details
the new organizational structure of the CEA and the functions of its Chairman
and Members. The Chairman of the CEA was appointed in September 1976, and
five of its seven members are now in position. The Electricity (Supply) Act
was amended, with effect from October 8, 1976, to assign to the CEA new func-
tions, including, in particular, the formulation of short-term and perspective
plans for power development, training of personnel, interconnected system
operations, and research and development; these are in addition to its general
responsibility for developing a sound, adequate and uniform power policy and
coordinating the activities of the planning agencies in relation to the con-
trol and utilization of national power resources.
32.       Planning in the past has been very much on an 'ad hoc' basis but,
with the increasing sophistication of the Indian power sector, the need to
undertake an integrated national approach to sectoral development is now
clearly recognized. The unified operation of power systems on a regional



- 10 -
basis has already commenced; the Southern Region grid went into operation in
August 1972, and progressive integration of power systems in other regions is
intended to pave the way for an all-India grid. There is a US$1.6 million
UNDP-assisted project to help CEA establish a systems operations organization,
and provision was included in IDA Credit 604-IN (Fourth Power Transmission
Project) to help finance the cost of consultants to carry out technical,
economic and financial studies on a regional and national basis in order to
produce a long-term National Plan for Power Development in India. Little
progress has been made so far in development of this National Plan, due to
staff constraints within the CEA, but a study team is expected to be estab-
lished in the next few months, and meaningful progress should be made
thereafter.
33.       An immediate requirement is the need for a detailed system study
of the future interconnected 400 kV transmission system to produce the
technical information necessary for system and plant design. The Government
has agreed to employ consultants as necessary to assist the CEA in carrying
out the detailed studies required, and to establish by March 31, 1977 a com-
mittee to set standard nation-wide design parameters for all 400 kV construc-
tion, whether carried out by the Center or by the States (Section 4.02 of
Development Credit Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The project was appraised by missions which visited India in January/
February 1976 and in July/August 1976. A report entitled "Appraisal of the
Singrauli Thermal Power Project" (No. 1159c-IN, dated February 4, 1977) is
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were
held in Washington in December 1976. The Government of India was represented
by Mr. V. Nayyar of the Ministry of Finance and Mr. R.C. Bhargava of the
Ministry of Energy, and the National Thermal Power Corporation was represented
by Mr. D.V. Kapur, Chairman and Managing Director. Attached as Annex III is a
credit and project summary.
Project Description
35.       The proposed project consists of construction of the first 600 MW
of capacity in the Singrauli thermal power station, together with ancillary
equipment and related works and the 400 kV transmission facilities to convey
this amount of power to the bulk supply point. The power station will be
constructed on the Singrauli coal field at Kota in the State of Uttar Pradesh.
It is expected to reach 2,000 MW capacity -- consisting of five 200 MW and
two 500 MW generating units -- by October 1985. The first three 200 MW
units are expected to be commissioned by October 1, 1981, April 1, 1982,
and October 1, 1982, respectively. The principal components of the project
include civil works; three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three 680 tonnes
per hour boilers, complete with all auxiliaries, and ancillary electrical and
mechanical equipment; coal transportation and handling equipment; and a 400 kV
transmission system consisting of about 460 circuit kms of single circuit line,
and associated equipment.



Project Cost and Financing
36.       The total Singrauli development, including associated transmission,
is estimated to cost about US$1.2 billion equivalent. The project cost, in-
cluding contingencies, is estimated at US$397 million equivalent, of which
about US$51.3 million represents direct and indirect foreign exchange costs.
Interest during construction adds about US$44 million to the financing re-
quired. A breakdown of these cost estimates is provided in Annex III.
37.       The proposed credit would provide 38% of the total project cost.
The balance of the financing would be made available by the Government in
the form of loans and equity contribution so that NTPC's debt would not
exceed 50% of its capitalization.
Procurement and Disbursement
38.       All equipment financed under the proposed credit would be procured
through international competitive bidding. The proceeds of the credit would
be disbursed against 100% of the cost of consultants' services (US$1.0 mil-
lion) and of the cost of the following items of equipment: turbogenerators and
associated equipment (US$40.0 million), boiler plant and associated equipment
(US$58.0 million), instrumentation and controls (US$6.0 million), transmission
system equipment (US$20.0 million), and other itemized equipment (US$18.0
million). US$7.0 million would be unallocated. Indian manufacturers competing
under international competitive bidding would be granted a preference margin
of 15% or the current rate of import duty, whichever is less. Since 200 MW
units, boilers and associated equipment are manufactured in India at inter-
nationally competitive prices, it is likely that local manufacturers will
submit the lowest conforming bids for most of the above items.
Project Implementation
39.       The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), which would own and
operate the Singrauli plant, was established in 1975, with an initial author-
ized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$140 million). It is managed by
a Board of Directors of not less than four and not more than fifteen. GOI
intends to restrict the size of the Board to seven or eight for the time
being; seven Directors have been appointed, of whom two are full time. A
competent and experienced Chairman has been appointed and NTPC is making
good progress in the appointment of its key staff. NTPC places special
importance on the need for training of engineers and operators for the opera-
tion and maintenance of its thermal stations, and the Corporation is develop-
ing programs for training the operating staff. However, the first generating
units are not scheduled to go into commercial operation until 1981/82; in the
near term, emphasis will be placed on the formulation of training for pre-
operational spheres of activity such as planning, design, construction,
management and finance.
40.       Consultants have been appointed to assist in design and supervi-
sion of construction of the various aspects of the project. The Thermal
Design Organization of CEA are the consultants for the power station; they



- 12 -
will be assisted by overseas specialists in the more specialized areas of
design, who will also give a second opinion on layout, design and engi-
neering. The Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board has been appointed as
consultant for the design of and preparation of specifications for the 400
kV Singrauli/Obra/Kanpur line, and the National Hydro Power Corporation,
whose personnel have had experience in 400 kV design and construction, has
been appointed to supervise construction of the 400 kV transmission asso-
ciated with the project (Sections 2.02 and 2.03 of Project Agreement).
41.       An acceptable project implementation plan has been submitted to
the Association. Preliminary works -- including site survey, hydrological
and subsoil investigations and land acquisition -- are well advanced, and
design work and draft specifications for the turbo-generators, boilers and
auxiliary plant and for the transmission towers have been drawn up.
Singrauli power will be sold under long-term contracts to selected States
(Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan) and to the Delhi Electricity
Supply Undertaking. The CEA will take into consideration the availability
of power from centrally owned generating stations in planning the development
programs of State Electricity Boards to ensure that a surplus power situation
does not arise.
42.       The Government has agreed to take all necessary steps to ensure
that adequate coal supplies are available by the time the first generating
unit is commissioned (Section 3.04 of Development Credit Agreement). Large
reserves of coal have been proven at the Singrauli coal field, and no problem
is foreseen with regard to the availability of adequate quantities for the
proposed thermal power station. Rail India Technical and Economic Services
is responsible for the design and supervision of construction of the trans-
portation system for moving coal from the mine to the power station. All of
the necessary steps are being coordinated by the Ministry of Energy.
43.       Adequate measures will be taken to minimize the adverse ecologi-
cal effects of the project, including stack emissions, heat dissipation
and ash disposal (Section 2.11 of Project Agreement). The approval of the
National Committee on Environmental Planning has been obtained, and safety
regulations for power stations will be strictly enforced.
NTPC Finances
44.       NTPC is expected to construct and commission two 2,000 MW stations,
one at Singrauli in Uttar Pradesh and one at Korba in Madhya Pradesh, by
October 1986. GOI's investment through 1986/87 in this program and in the
associated 400 kV transmission will be almost US$3,000 million equivalent,
an investment which would otherwise have to be made by SEBs in expanding
their own generating capacity.
45.       The first generating unit at Singrauli is planned to be in com-
mercial operation by 1981/82. As the generating capacity increases, NTPC's
annual revenue would increase at a faster rate than its operating expenses
and produce a rate of return rising gradually from 0.6% in 1981/82 to 9.5%



- 13 -
by 1987/88. NTPC's internal cash generation would cover its annual debt
service by 1.1 times in each of the first two years of operation and there-
after by 1.4 to 1.6 times through 1987/88.
46.       NTPC has agreed to achieve in 1987/88 and maintain thereafter a
rate of return of not less than 9-1/2%, and to set tariffs from the time of
commissioning of the first 200 MW generating unit at levels not lower than
those estimated to be required to meet this target in 1987/88 (Section 4.03
of Project Agreement). In view of the high capital investment in the early
stages and the time involved in commissioning generating units, this approach
to reaching the target rate of return in 1987/88 is appropriate.
47.       NTPC has agreed to sell the project's output of power under bulk
supply contracts satisfactory to the Association (Section 2.10 of Project
Agreement) which will be based upon the principle of marginal cost pricing.
In view of the pattern of future development in the power sector, with two
large Central power stations likely to be in varying stages of commissioning
and a national system load dispatch organization in operation by the time the
Singrauli development is completed, the formulation of a bulk tariff policy
is likely to be complicated. As a consequence, it would be premature to go
beyond reaching agreement at this stage on the principles to be applied in
determining the Singrauli bulk supply contracts. The important consideration
is to ensure that NTPC's income from the sale of power will be adequate at all
times to provide the agreed rate of return mentioned above. As a first step,
the Government has agreed to take steps to obtain by September 30, 1977, from
selected SEBs an undertaking acceptable to the Association to purchase in the
aggregate not less than 85% of the output from the project (Section 4.01 of
Development Credit Agreement).
Project Benefits and Risks
48.       The proposed Singrauli development offers economies of scale and
of location at the coal pit-head. Provision of hydro power of the same
capacity would be more costly and could not be constructed within the neces-
sary time frame. The Singrauli development is also preferable to the next
best alternative of small thermal units at consuming centers; when compared
to such units, the equalizing rate of return on the project investment is
32%, i.e., at any lower discount rate the proposed project is indeed the
least cost solution. The overall economic justification is that in an envi-
ronment where there has been a long history of power shortages the value of
power to consumers will almost certainly be a good deal higher than the
tariffs which they are expected to pay and which have been used in the cal-
culation of the internal rate of return. Thus, the calculated rate of return
for the project of 10% must be regarded as well below the true economic rate
of return on the proposed expansion of power generating capacity.
49.       Project risks are no greater than can normally be expected with
operations of this type.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-/
Generally, the implementation of projects has been proceeding
reasonably well. Details on the execution of individual projects are
below. The level of disbursements was US$551 million in FY76 or 62%
of Bank Group commitments to India in that year. The undisbursed pipeline
of US$1,640.8 million as of December 31, 1976, corresponds roughly to
commitments over the preceding two-year period and reflects the leadtime
which would be expected given the mix of fast and slow-disbursing projects
in the India program.
Ln. No. 902    Tenth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$70.0 million loan of June 8, 1973; Effective
Date: August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Ln. No. 1097   Eleventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$100 million loan of April 2, 1975;
Effective Date: July 1, 1975; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. Loan 902-IN is fully committed
and commitments are progressing satisfactorily for Loan 1097-IN. Disburse-
ments under Loan 902-IN are ahead of schedule. A proposal for a twelfth
loan is under consideration.
Ln. No. 614    Tarai Seeds Project; US$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Effective Date: September 12, 1969; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the production, processing and marketing of certified seeds of high yielding
varieties. The.corporation is working effectively and has developed an ex-
cellent reputation for quality seed. Expansion of three processing plants
is well under way. Delivery of some equipment in damaged condition, and
retendering, because of poor response for some others, has delayed delivery
schedules necessitating an extension of the Closing Date by one year to
December 31, 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense and with the under-
standint that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengtns and weaknesses in project execution.

Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Cr. No. 278    Mysore Agricultural Credit Project; US$40.0 million credit
of January 7, 1972; Effective Date: September 25, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Cr. No. 391    Madhya Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$33.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973; Effective Date: October 10, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Cr. No. 392    Uttar Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$38.0 million
credit of June 8, 1973; Effective Date: October 31, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Cr. No. 440    Bihar Agricultural Credit Project; US$32.0 million credit
of November 29, 1973; Effective Date: March 29, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Cr. No. 540    Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC)
Project; US$75.0 million credit of April 28, 1975;
Effective Date: August 5, 1975; Closing Date: Dec-
ember 31, 1977
Apart from the Punjab project, which consists of mechanization
equipment only, all the above agricultural credit projects are similar in
structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-term credit to farm-
ers through credit institutions for such on-farm investments as tractors,
minor irrigation and land-leveling. Disbursement of the minor irrigation
components are on schedule. Tractor procurement was delayed following
changes in both the supply and demand situations after the projects were
originally appraised, which prompted GOI to request that indigenous as well
as imported models should be eligible for IDA financing under these credits.
The Executive Directors approved this request in December 1973 and those
credits which have tractor components have been amended accordingly. Tractor
procurement is proceeding satisfactorily. Credit 540 is a continuation
nationwide of the previous program of agricultural credit projects, which
were confined to individual states. ARDC will continue to act as the
financial intermediary for refinancing agricultural credit.

Cr. No. 267    Wheat Storage Project; US$5.0 million credit of August 23,
1971; Effective Date: November 14, 1972; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
The Food Corporation of India is making satisfactory progress
in the execution of this project. Piling and foundation work is nearly com-
pleted. Silo construction has begun and staff training is in progress.
Cr. No. 456    Himachal Pradesh Apple Processing and Marketing Project;
US$13 million credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date:
September 26, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This project was designed to promote the development of apple
processing and marketing in Himachal Pradesh, and comprises grading and
packing centers, cold storages, a juice processing plant, road improvements
and cableways. The project encountered initial delays due to managerial
and technical problems, however, remedial measures have been taken to over-
come these difficulties. A recent review mission found a satisfactory
improvement in the prospects for successful project implementation.
Cr. No. 403    Telecommunications V Project; US$80.0 million credit of
June 25, 1973; Effective Date: July 30, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
Material supply problems which delayed the start of this project
have been resolved and physical achievements were at record levels during
fiscal year 1976. However, to cover the delivery and installation of im-
ported transmission and switching equipment, the closing date was extended
by one year to December 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 242    Power Transmission II Project; US$75.0 million credit of
May 3, 1971; Effective Date: July 29, 1971; Closing Date:
March 31, 1977
Cr. No. 377    Power Transmission III Project; US$85.0 million credit
of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: October 10, 1973; Closing
Date: September 30, 1977
Cr. No. 604    Power Transmission IV Project; US$150.0 million credit of
January 22, 1976; Effective Date: October 22, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1981
Power Transmission II suffered initial delays because of problems
associated with the preparations for international bidding and the analysis
of a very large number of bids involved. All contracts have now been awarded.
Due to variations in exchange rates, an undisbursed balance of about US$2
million, by the Closing Date, is likely. For Power Transmission III, vir-
tually all equipment has been ordered; there will be a substantial cost
overrun due to international price increases, part of which is being met
from Power Transmission IV. For power Transmission IV, bids for most of
the equipment have been invited.

Cr. No. 264    Cochin II Fertilizer Project; US$20 million credit of
July 30, 1971; Effective Date: December 2, 1971; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
Cr. No. 481    Trombay IV Fertilizer Expansion Project; US$50.0 million
credit of June 19, 1974; Effective Date: August 21, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Cr. No. 520    Sindri Fertilizer Project; US$91 million credit of December 18,
1974; Effective Date: February 27, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1978
Ln. No. 1079   IFFCO Fertilizer Project; US$109 million loan of January 24,
1975; Effective Date: April 28, 1975; Closing Date: March 31,
1979
Cr. No. 598    Fertilizer Industry Project; US$105.0 million credit
of December 31, 1975; Effective Date: March 1, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The Cochin Fertilizer Project is being commisssioned, about 31
months behind the appraisal estimate. Progress on the Trombay IV project has
been good although project completion may be delayed by about four months
because of longer than expected delivery times for critical equipment. Under
the Sindri projet plant construction and erection is proceeding generally
according to schedule except for a one-month delay due to anticipated delays
in receipt of some materials. Commencement of commercial production is ex-
pected by March 1978. The anticipated cost to complete the project is pre-
sently running within budget. The IFFCO project was delayed by about a year
as a result of a change in feedstock from fuel oil to naphtha and delays in
completion of engineering contracts. The project is now progressing satis-
factorily based on naphtha as feedstock. Site work has begun, process- and
time-critical equipment is being ordered, and engineering work is well under
way. Credit 598-IN is designed to increase the utilization of existing
fertilizer production capacity. The project has encountered delays in sub-
project preparation and investment approvals by the Government. Further,
some of the sub-projects identified earlier may not materialize because of
reconsideration by the Central and State governments. The Central Govern-
ment has submitted a list of sub-projects to replace the ones that are
likely to be dropped. Because of the above, the project is likely to be
delayed by 6-12 months.
Cr. No. 294    Bihar Agricultural Markets Project; US$14.0 million credit
of March 29, 1972; Effective Date: July 31, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
Cr. No. 378    Karnataka Wholesale Agricultural Markets Project; US$8.0 mil-
lion credit of May 9, 1973; Effective Date: September 7, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979



ANNEX II
Page 7 of 12
These projects were designed to help with establishment of whole-
sale markets in a number of towns in Bihar and Karnataka. Progress under
the Bihar project has generally been satisfactory. Markets construction in
Bihar was delayed due to legal challenges arising out of the state's acqui-
sition of land for market sites; however, these difficulties have been satis-
factorily resolved. Construction of markets is well advanced and a number
have opened for business. Progress under the Karnataka project is much less
satisfactory, however, largely due to deficiencies in market planning, design
and construction. These problems and remedial actions have been brought to
the attention of the State and Central Government. The project is being mon-
itored closely to try and bring about the necessary improvements in implemen-
tation.
Cr. No. 312    Population Project; US$21.2 million credit of June 14, 1972;
Effective Date: May 9, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
This credit is designed to finance an experimental and research
oriented population project in Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. The project's
infrastructure, which would provide the optimum facilities (buildings, equip-
ment, staff and transport) according to GOI standards in selected districts
in each state, is almost complete. The two Population Centers, which will
design and monitor research aimed at improving the family planning program,
are now functioning.
Cr. No. 342    Agricultural Universities Project; US$12.0 million credit of
November 10, 1972; Effective Date: June 8, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31. 1979
The project involves the development of the agricultural uni-
versities in Assam and Bihar. Initial lag in implementation on account
of late appointments of project staff has been overcome. Campus plans
have been approved, and construction has started in Assam and is scheduled
to start in Bihar by mid 1977. Disbursement which has been slow because
of initial delays should accelerate now that construction and equipment
procurement are under way.
Cr. No. 356    Industrial Development Bank of India Project; US$25.0 million
credit of February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June 22, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Loan No. 1260 Second Industrial Development Bank of India Project;
US$40.0 million loan of June 10, 1976; Effective Date:
August 10, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
The first IDBI Project (Cr. 356) had a slow start mainly due to
institutional problems in the participating State Financial Corporations.
However, the credit is now fully committed. In order to continue Bank
Group's involvement in assisting small and medium scale industries, the
second operation (Ln. 1260) was approved on June 10, 1976.

Cr. No. 390    Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$55.0 million
credit of January 22, 1974; Effective Date: March 13, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
A substantial cost overrun on the project from US$158 million
equivalent to about US$375 million equivalent has been caused by inflation
and price increases resulting from delays in appointment of engineering con-
sultants and redesign of certain project components. The project has been
redefined and rephased to fit the financing available from the Credit, local
loans and bonds, and internal cash generation of the project entity. The
revised cost estimates for the implementation period 1975/76 to 1979/80
amount to US$266 million equivalent excluding interest during construction.
All major contracts for civil works, equipment and materials have been
awarded. This is expected to considerably speed up disbursements which
has been slow. Financial performance of the project entity during 1975/76
was satisfactory, and major rate increases from April 1, 1976 should ensure
continuing financial viability of the project entity.
Cr. No. 616    Eleventh Industrial Imports Project; US$200.0 million credit
of February 24, 1976; Effective Date: April 1, 1976; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
This credit was signed on February 24, 1976, and became effective
on April 1, 1976.
Cr. No. 427    Calcutta Urban Development Project; US$35.0 million credit
of September 12, 1973; Effective Date: January 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Following considerable increases in project costs, GOI and IDA
finalized a project redefinition in April 1976, to accommodate the project
to funding available. It is now expected to be substantially completed by
March 1979. Agreements have been reached on consultants services and
technical assistance, as provided for under the project.
Cr. No. 482     Karnataka Dairy Development Project; US$30 million credit of
June 19, 1974; Effective Date: December 23, 1974; Closing
Date: September 30, 1982
Cr. No. 521    Rajasthan Dairy Development Project;; US$27.7 million credit
of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: August 8, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
Cr. No. 522    Madhya Pradesh Dairy Development Project; US$16.4 million
credit of December 18, 1974; Effective Date: July 23, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
These three credits totalling US$74.1 million support dairy devel-
opment projects organized along the lines of the successful AMnL dairy coop-
erative scheme in Gujarat State. The Karnataka Project which got off to a
slow start has begun to show improvement under new management appointed

recently. Farmer response has been good and about 250 dairy cooperatives
with small farmer participation are functioning effectively. Two Dairy
Unions have been established. Close supervision is being maintained. In
Madhya Pradesh good progress has been made. About 110 new dairy cooperatives
societies have been established. Detailed design studies for plant construc-
tion are complete. Technical services investments are being made. Contracts
have been placed for livestock imports. The Rajasthan project is also doing
well. Four milk unions have been formed and excellent progress has been made
in organizing the servicing of nearly 350 dairy cooperatives at the village
level. Plant-designs are ready, and procurement is to start soon. KDDC
decision to procure plant equipment jointly with RDDC and MPDDC on the same
tender should lead to a recovery of considerable time lost earlier.
Cr. No. 532    Godavari Barrage Project; US$45 million credit of March 7,
1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1980
Both the civil works and equipment tenders have been awarded after
international competitive bidding. Work is in progress.
Ln. No. 1011   Chambal (Rajasthan) Command Area Development Project; US$52
million loan of June 19, 1974; Effective Date: December 12,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Cr. No. 502    Rajasthan Canal Command Area Development Project; US$83 mil-
lion credit of July 31, 1974; Effective Date: December 30,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
Cr. No. 562    Chambal (Madhya Pradesh) Command Area Development Project;
US$24 million credit of June 20, 1975; Effective Date:
September 18, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Ln. No. 1251   Andhra Pradesh Irrigation and Command Area Development
(TW)         Composite Project; US$145.0 million loan (Third Window)
of June 10, 1976; Effective Date: September 7,1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
These projects, based on existing large irrigation systems, are
designed to improve the efficiency of water utilization and, where possible,
to use water savings for bringing additional areas under irrigation. Canal
lining and other irrigation infrastructures, drainage, and land shaping are
prominent components of these projects. In addition, provisions have been
made to increase agricultural production and marketing by reforming and
upgrading agricultural extension services and by providing processing and
storage facilities and village access roads. Progress of these projects
is generally satisfactory and particularly successful with repect to
agricultural extension.
Cr. No. 541    West Bengal Agricultural Development Project; US$34 million
credit of April 28, 1975; Effective Date: August 28, 1975;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 12
The project became effective on July 31, 1975. Successful reor-
ganization of agricultural extension services has been a major achievement,
but preparations for lending operations have been slow mainly due to poor
coordination of project agencies. IDA and the government of West Bengal
have agreed on measures to improve coordination and on a timetable covering
a range of project activities. Progress with preliminaries for procurement
of equipment, markets construction and riverlift completions are satis-
factory.
Cr. No. 526    Drought Prone Areas Project; US$35.0 million credit of
January 24, 1975; Effective Date: June 9, 1975; Closing
Date: June 30, 1980
Progress varies among components but overall is satisfactory.
Expenditure to date is less than anticipated but is reasonable because
price inflation has been much less than expected. Disbursement perform-
ance is poor and the Borrower has been requested to expedite claims.
Greater attention is now being paid to data collection to measure project
performance. This is essential since several components are innovative.
The Systems Research Institute of Poona has been contracted to design an
information system to facilitate monitoring and evaluation.
Cr. No. 572    Rural Electrification Project; US$57.0 million credit of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: October 23, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Eleven states have now fulfilled the conditions of eligibility for
on-lending under this project [compared with six at the time of appraisal].
The project got off to a slow start, due principally to the need to adapt
specifications and tender documents to international competitive bidding
procedures, but these problems have been overcome. As of September 1976,
orders had been placed for 60 approved rural electrification schemes, and
tenders had been invited or were in the course of preparation for others.
Cr. No. 582    Railways XIII Project; US$110.0 million credit of August 26,
1975; Effective Date: October 10, 1975; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
The project is intended to cover most of the foreign exchange
requirements of Indian Railway's (IR) investment program from April 1, 1975,
through March 31, 1977. Since the approval of the project, increased pro-
duction in steel products in India and further developments in IR's indigen-
ization program have resulted in a less than anticipated foreign exchange
requirement. It is expected, therefore, that of a total Credit of US$110
million, some US$30-40 million may be undisbursed at the end of the current
project period. During the year 1975/76, IR carried 223 million tons of
freight traffic, 6% more than forecasted. The project is being implemented
satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 585    Uttar Pradesh Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$40.0
million credit of September 25, 1975; Effective Date:
February 6, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project had a slow start due to delays in preparation of techni-
cal reports for regional and local water authorities. The technical reports
for about a third of the project have now been finalized and construction
works started in October 1976, about one year behind schedule. All consul-
tants for engineering, organization, management and accounting services for
the Jal Nigam (Water Supply Development Corporation) and the Jal Sansthans
(water authorities) have been engaged. Significant institutional develop-
ment can be expected only after the consultants submit their final recommenda-
tions. The project is expected to be completed by March 1980, approximately
9 months behind schedule.
Cr. No. 609    Madhya Pradesh Forestry Technical Assistance Project;
US$4.0 million credit of February 26, 1976; Effective
Date: May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
This project will identify a sound resource base for pulp and paper
manufacture and related industries, develop suitable logging systems, and
undertake a feasibility study to determine optimal use of the existing wood
resources in the Bastar District of southern Madhya Pradesh. It also includes
a study of ways to integrate the area's tribal population with future develop-
ment. After initial delays due to difficulties in employing key personnel,
project implementation is now satisfactory. For the feasibility study, proj-
ect authorities have prepared a short list of three foreign consulting firms,
who are now being asked to prepare detailed proposals. On the basis of these
proposals, the final selection will be made shortly.
Cr. No. 610    Integrated Cotton Development Project; US$18.0 million

Good progress has been made since negotiations. The National
Seeds Corporation (NSC) has withdrawn from seeds production as planned, hav-
ing handed over to State Seeds Corporation (SSC). Detailed production pro-
grams, by variety and responsible institution, have been prepared for breeder,
foundation and certified generations. GOI and State Governments have made
equity contributions to SSC thus ensuring financing of major project activity.
Orders will shortly be placed for processing machinery to provide bridging
capacity pending the construction of new processing plants. Tender documents
for the first purchases of farm machinery have been finalized.
