SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Singrauli 2,000 MW thermal
power station and associated 400 kV transmission. The development will cost
around US$1.2 billion and the cost of the Project, which will comprise the
first three 200 MW generating units, boilers and the ancillary plant together
with that part of the 400 kV transmission required to evacuate power from
these three units, is estimated at US$397 million equivalent excluding in-
terest during construction. The Government of India (GOI) has asked the
Association to assist in financing the Project and an IDA Credit of US$150
million is proposed. GOI will onlend the proceeds of the proposed Credit to
the National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC), and will provide the
balance of the finance required.
ii.       The proposed Credit would be the ninth IDA Credit for power in
India; the eight previous Credits for power aggregated US$446 million. Addi-
tionally the Bank has made seven loans for power aggregating US$179.5 million.
iii.      The Indian power sector is large and demand is expanding rapidly.
To maintain a continuing capacity to meet the future demand on an efficient
basis, GOI is planning to supplement the development plans of the State
Electricity Boards with the installation of a number of large centrally owned
hydro power stations, and thermal power stations of up to 2,000 MW capacity
located on the coal fields and supplying bulk power to the States via a 400 kV
interconnected transmission system. Singrauli is the first of the proposed
thermal developments.
iv.       Two generating companies have been set up, NTPC to construct
and operate the Central thermal power stations and the National Hydro Power
Corporation Limited (NHPC) to construct and operate Central hydro-electric
power stations.
v.        The demand for power in the past has been greater than available
capacity and, although the situation is now improving due to better plant
utilization, it is doubtful if the commissioning of new capacity will be able
to keep pace with demand. Some 20,000 MW of additional generating capacity is
scheduled for commissioning during the Sixth Plan period (1980-84), including
the first stage (1,000 MW) of the Singrauli development, all of which is
necessary to meet the demand.
vi.       The proposed Singrauli development is the least-cost method of
providing additional capacity of 2000 MW. It has been compared with the next
best alternative program, which would involve the installation of smaller
thermal power stations of equal aggregate capacity at load centers. The



- ii -
analysis gave an equalizing discount rate of 32%, which is higher than the
opportunity cost of capital. The internal economic rate of return is 10%,
which simply means that, on average, bulk sales will be priced at roughly
marginal costs.
vii.      NTPC will construct and operate the Singrauli development which
includes the Project. Additionally it is proposed that NTPC should construct
and operate the 2,000 MW Korba development in Madhya Pradesh. NTPC, which
is in the process of building up its establishment, has appointed the Thermal
Design Organization of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) to carry out
design work and assist in supervising construction of the Singrauli power
station. Additionally NTPC is appointing specialist consultants acceptable
to the Association to review its prime consultant's design, and assist in the
more specialized areas. The Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Board (UPSEB) has
been appointed to design the 400 kV transmission associated with the Project.
NHPC will supervise construction of the transmission.
viii.     The proposed Credit will be used to finance specific items of equip-
ment which are suitable for international competitive bidding. Procurement
would be on this basis and would be subject to a domestic preference of 15%
in evaluating bids. Disbursements would be made against the foreign cost of
imported equipment and materials and the ex-factory cost of locally manu-
factured equipment and materials.
ix.       NTPC will own and operate the 400 kV transmission network, and will
transmit power to selected SEBs for sale at suitable bulk supply points in
the States.
x.        The bulk supply prices would be based on the marginal cost of
generation and transmission which should enable NTPC to achieve a minimum
rate of return of 9-1/2% on the original cost of its net assets in service
after the 2,000 MW Singrauli development has been commissioned.
xi.       The capitalization of NTPC would be made up of debt and equity in
a ratio of about 50/50.
xii.      During the six-year project construction period to March 31, 1983,
NTPC's forecast investments of US$2,111 million would be financed from the
proposed Credit (7%) and capital provided by GOI (93%). The forecast capital
requirements of NTPC to finance its investment program through FY1987 would be
a little under US$3,000 million which represents about 20% of GOI's probable
total investment in power during the five years of the Sixth Plan period.
xiii.     With the assurances proposed in Chapter 7, the Project would be
suitable for a Credit of US$150 million.

SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Singrauli 2,000 MW thermal power station,
located in the Mirzapur District of Uttar Pradesh, and associated 400 kV
transmission. The power station is planned to comprise five 200 MW and two
500 MW generating units and the total estimated cost of the development, in-
cluding transmission but excluding interest during construction, is US$1.2
billion equivalent. The Project will consist of the first three 200 MW gene-
rating units with boilers and ancillary plant and that part of the 400 kV
transmission which is required to evacuate the power generated by these units.
The estimated cost of the Project is Rs 3,573 million (US$397 million equiva-
lent), excluding interest during construction amounting to about US$44 million
equivalent, and the Government of India (GOI) has asked the Association to
assist in financing the Project. The proposed Credit of US$150 million, would
be used to finance specific items of electrical, mechanical and transmission
equipment which are suitable for international competitive bidding. GOI will
onlend the proceeds of the Credit to the National Thermal Power Corporation
Ltd. (NTPC) and will provide the balance of the funds required to complete the
Project in the form of part equity and part loan. The proposed Credit of
US$150 million represents about 34% of the financing required for the Project
and 12.5% of the estimated total cost (excluding interest diring construction)
of the Singrauli development.
1.02      The Bank has made seven loans to India for power Projects amount-
ing to US$179.5 million, and IDA eight credits totalling US$446 million.
US$165.5 million financed the construction of generating plant, US$23 mil-
lion financed the purchase of construction equipment for the Beas hydro-
electric project, US$380 million was for high voltage transmission and US$57
million was for Rural Electrification. All the loans and credits for the
generating plant, the Beas project and the first transmission loan (416-IN)
have been fully disbursed. Of the finance made available for the remaining
transmission (Credit 242-IN of May 1971 - US$75 million, Credit 377-IN of
May 1973 - US$85 million and Credit 604-IN of January 1976 - US$150 million),
funds have been fully committed in the case of the first two credits and
disbursements are beginning to accelerate. Credit 604-IN became effective on
October 22, 1976 and no disbursements have yet been made. No disbursements
have yet been made against Credit 572-IN (Rural Electrification) but
substantial commmitments have been entered into and substantial drawdowns
are anticipated during the first half of 1977.
1.03      The principal objectives of the transmission credits have been
the expansion of the high voltage transmission system to achieve interconnec-
tion within and between the State systems, to improve the financial position
of the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and to bring about progressive institu-
tional improvements. The enlargement of the Central Electricity Authority's



-2-
(CEA's) powers and the amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act have helped
in achieving these objectives.
Background
1.04      The development of power in India proceeded, in the past, on an
uncoordinated State-wise basis. As the demand increased and larger generating
stations had to be installed to achieve greater economy of production and
size, an attempt was made to coordinate planning on a regional basis with
interstate transfers of power. With a rapidly expanding power sector in a
country the size of India, GOI recognized that regional planning would
have to be advanced further with the installation of even larger power sta-
tions and the introduction of Central planning in order to meet the future
demand on an efficient basis. Preliminary planning for the Sixth Five-Year
Plan period, therefore, envisaged the construction of a number of large Central
thermal power stations, up to 2,000 MW capacity, located on coal fields and
supplying bulk power to the States via an interconnected 400 kV transmission
system. Five sites were selected, one in each of the Northern, Western and
Eastern Regions and two in the Southern Region, and feasibility studies were
made. Reports were published in December 1974 and GOI formally requested
Bank assistance in financing the first of these developments, the Singrauli
project, in 1975.  A decision to appraise was deferred pending the receipt of
additional information, which was provided in the form of a Supplement to the
Feasibility Reports during the latter part of 1975.
1.05      This report is based on information provided by (i) the Feasibility
Reports of December 1974, (ii) the Supplement to the Feasibility Reports,
(iii) GOI, CEA and NTPC, (iv) an appraisal by Messrs. J. Beach, A.E.
Bailey, S.S. Scales and J. Warford in January/February 1976, and (v) an
updating mission by Messrs. A.E. Bailey and S.S. Scales in July/August 1976.
2. ENERGY RESOURCES AND THE POWER SECTOR
2.01      Inadequate supplies of electric power were a constant feature of the
Fourth Plan period (1970-1974) and, although there was some improvement by the
second year of the Fifth Plan period (1975-76), power shortage still remains
a constraint on the economies of several of the Regions. This is likely to be
a problem for several years ahead which, hopefully, will be progressively
alleviated as the large new Central thermal, and hydro power stations planned
by GOI come on stream to augment the States generation development programs.
Availability of energy resources for these developments is discussed in the
following paragraphs.
Energy Resources
2.02      The main commercial energy resources are coal, oil and natural
gas and hydropower. There are also resources of nuclear fuels, principally
uranium and thorium, and India's power program includes the construction



- 3 -
of further "CANDU" type heavy water reactors using domestically produced
natural uranium as fuel. Two nuclear power stations have been constructed
to date and a third is under construction. There are also some geothermal
energy sites, but the potential appears to be limited.
2.03      Coal is by far the most extensive indigenous fossil fuel; reserves
are estimated at 81 billion tons of which some 21 billion tons have been
proven. Additionally, total reserves of lignite at the Neyveli field in
Tamil Nadu are estimated at around 2 billion tons. If generally unworkable
coal, e.g. coal with high ash and moisture content is excluded, this estimate
of recoverable and saleable coal and lignite is reduced to something like 45
billion tons which, on a forecast country wide usage, would be adequate for
some 300 years.
2.04      By comparison with coal, proven reserves of oil in India are pre-
sently small; exploratory and drilling activities to date have proven an
estimated 185 million tons on shore. It is probable that further useful
deposits may be found, particularly offshore, but until a great deal more
exploratory drillings have been done, the magnitude of further resources
must remain a matter of speculation. Reserves of natural gas, which is found
in India both alone and in association with crude oil, are estimated at over
100 billion cubic meters.
2.05      The firm power potential of hydro-electric power reserves is es-
timated at 41,000 MW at a load factor of 60%, equivalent to an annual output
of 216 TWh, of which some 8,000 MW will have been developed by the end of the
Fifth Plan period (1978/79); some 25% is in the Northern Region with the
balance spread over the North Eastern (30%), Southern (20%), Western (18%)
and Eastern (7%) regions.
2.06      Development of generating facilities for the foreseeable future
will be based on coal or lignite burning thermal stations and hydroelectric
power stations with a small but gradually developing nuclear program.
The Power Sector
2.07      The Indian power sector is complex because electricity supply is
within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Central Government and the State
Governments. Annex 1 describes the organization of the power industry.
The principal agencies in the industry are the State Electricity Boards (SEBs)
which are responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity within each State and for the control and regulation of other
supply undertakings which are private licensees, the Atomic Energy Commission,
the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and the two Central Power Corporations
which are discussed below. The CEA, which comes under the Ministry of Energy,
has recently had its powers enlarged and, in addition to its general respons-
ibilities for national power policies, is now to be responsible for the for-
mulation of plans for power development, training of personnel, interconnected
systems operation, research and development.  Enlargement of CEA's powers
involved amendments to the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 which were agreed



-4-
during negotiations for Credit 604-IN (Fourth Power Transmission Project).
At the same time it was agreed that the appointment of a Chairman of the re-
organized CEA would be a condition of effectiveness of that Credit. It was
emphasized by the Association that no further Bank Group lending in the power
sector would be negotiated until the agreed changes to the Act had been made.
Action has since been taken on all counts; the CEA's Chairman was appointed in
October 1976, an ordinance incorporating the agreed amendments to the general
provisions of the Act was issued on October 8, 1976 and enacted into law on
November 30, 1976 and amendments to the financial provisions of the Act were
approved by the Cabinet on December 8th 1976.
2.08      In view of the magnitude of the task of providing generating capa-
city to meet the forecast requirements of India, GOI has set up NTPC and
the National Hydro Power Corporation Limited (NHPC) to construct and operate
large capacity thermal and hydroelectric power stations.  Power planning,
country wide, will be coordinated by CEA to ensure that (a) all projects
carried out by NTPC, NHPC and the SEBs fit into the overall national program,
(b) the investments are made so as to be put to optimum use, and (c) a situa-
tion of surplus power without a taker does not arise.
2.09      Planning in the past has been very much on an 'ad hoc' basis, but
with the increasing sophistication of the Indian power sector, the need to
undertake an integrated national approach to sector development has been re-
cognized. The unified operation of power systems on a Regional basis has
already commenced; the Southern Regional grid-went into integrated operation
in August 1972 and progressive integration of power systems in other Regions
is intended to pave the way for an all-India grid. There is a US$1.6 million
equivalent UNDP-assisted project to help CEA establish a systems operations
organization, and provision was included in IDA Credit 604-IN (Power Transmis-
sion IV Project) to help finance the cost of consultants to carry out tech-
nical, economic and financial studies on a regional and national basis in
order to produce a long-term national plan for power development in India.
2.10      These studies have only just commenced.  The Government has yet
to crystallize its long-term plans for the central development of power
generation and the pattern of sector organization in which the national gene-
rating companies (NTPC and NHPC) are to operate has yet to be decided. GOI
feels that Singrauli and Korba (see para 3.04) together with the Badarpur
power station near Delhi, which might be taken over by NTPC, might be as
much as the Corporation can handle efficiently and, bearing in mind the mag-
nitude of the Sixth and Seventh Plan programs, other thermal and hydro power
corporations might have to be formed. Also the decision that NTPC should
own and operate the 400 kV transmission system which is required to eva-
cuate power from the Central thermal power stations is essentially an interim
solution and little thought has yet been given to the future national 400 kV
grid and the entity which would operate and maintain that system.
2.11      An immediate requirement is the need for a detailed system study
of the future interconnected 400 kV transmission system to investigate opera-
ting parameters under all foreseeable conditions and produce the technical



-5-
information necessary for system and plant design. There is also the question
of the organization which is to design and construct the 400 kV Central trans-
mission system. Since early action must be taken on both of these issues, GOI
has decided (1) that CEA will carry out the system studies and (2) NHPC, the
Chairman of which is a transmission specialist, will establish a transmission
wing which will be responsible for the design and construction of the 400 kV
transmission system excluding the design of the Singrauli/Obra/Kanpur section
associated with the Project, for which the Uttar Pradesh State Electricity
Board (UPSEB) has been appointed as consultant (see paragraph 4.09). With
regard to the proposal for the design and construction of the 400 kV Central
system, the establishment of a transmission wing within NHPC is an acceptable
short term solution but NHPC was formed for an entirely different purpose and
it would seem at some time in the future, a separate company will have to be
established to carry out these functions. Changes can only be made over a
period of time and continuous dialogue on this and other matters discussed
in the preceding paragraph will be maintained with GOI and CEA. The proposal
for carrying out the 400 kV system studies was further discussed during nego-
tiations and an assurance was obtained from GOI that consultants or specia-
lists satisfactory to the Association will be appointed to assist CEA in
these studies.
2.12      Another problem area is the need for standardization; a number of
400 kV transmission lines in addition to the proposed Central system are
planned or under construction and it would seem desirable to set up a com-
mittee to agree standard design parameters which should apply to all 400 kV
construction, otherwise problems can arise as and when these are intercon-
nected with the National system. This matter was also discussed during
negotiations and GOI has agreed to establish a committee not later than
March 31, 1977 to set standard design parameters for all 400 kV transmission
systems to be constructed in India.
2.13      A preliminary report, prepared by CEA, on the long term planning
study, for which US$2 million was included in Credit No. 604-IN to cover the
cost of consultants (see para 2.09), was also discussed during negotiations.
Little progress has been made on this study due to staff constraints within
CEA. However, the 400 kV system studies referred to in paragraph 2.11 are
part of long term planning, and with the establishment of a long term study
team within the next few months, it should be possible to make some meaningful
progress with this study. This will be routinely supervised by future missions.
Sector Characteristics
2.14      The demand for power in India has consistently been greater than
available capacity, principally because of financial constraints and lack of
plant maintenance but also because of failure, through poor planning, to meet
the targets for bringing new plant into operation. Installed generating
capacity reached 18,500 MW by the end of the Fourth Plan (1973/74) compared
to the target of 23,000 MW, and load restrictions, which have been mainly
directed at industry, have adversely affected the economic performance of the
country. This, together with the oil crisis in 1973/74 and the failure of



-6-
two monsoons, have been the main reasons for the slow down in load growth
during the last few years. For the 20 years or so prior to 1970, sales of Kwh
had been increasing at an average of 11% to 12% per year but this growth rate
slowed during the early 1970's; statistics for 1969/70 and 1974/75 which are
shown below indicate that annual growth of sales averaged just over 5% during
this period.

2.15      The situation was improving by the end of 1975 due to the commis-
sioning of new capacity and the better utilization of existing plant; the
national load factor improved from 49.7% in 1969/70 to 54% by 1975/76 and
the rate of growth in demand over 1974/75 is estimated at 12%. GOI expects
this improvement to continue and an average annual growth rate of 10% is fore-
cast through 1984. In view of the low growth rate during the last five
years and the probability of failing to achieve the Sixth Plan period tar-
get (see para 2.19), this might prove optimistic.
Existing Facilities
2.16      The total installed generating capacity for the whole of India at
March 31, 1976 was 20,111 MW. This excludes about 1,800 MW of non-utility
capacity, mostly thermal, which is owned by major industrial consumers to
meet their own needs. The generating capacity consists of:

2.17      Intrastate and interstate transmission is at 132 kV and 220 kV and,
generally, major load centers are interconnected by 132 kV and 33 kV sub-
transmission lines. Distribution voltages are 11 kV and 415/240 V. The
supply is generally reliable but losses and unaccounted for, at around 20% of
units sent out, are high.
Future Development
2.18      The power demand increased from 12,000 MW in 1970 to 15,200 MW in
1975 and is expected to increase to 19,800 MW by 1978/79, the end of the
Fifth Plan period, with output in that year estimated at 112 TWh. The planned
expansion of generating capacity during the Fifth Plan period which provided
for an additional 16,350 MW of plant (9,460 MW thermal, 6,420 MW hydro and
470 MW nuclear), is not now likely to be achieved and the target has been
revised to 12,500 MW which would bring the installed capacity by 1978/79 to
31,000 MW of which 29,200 MW would be utility plant with the balance of 1,800
MW non-utility.
2.19      The Sixth Plan (1979/80-1983/84) has yet to be prepared in detail
but on the assumption that growth of demand will continue at an average annual
rate of 10%, preliminary proposals indicate the addition of some 20,000 MW of
generating capacity during this period comprising 13,000 MW thermal, 6,200
MW hydro and 500 MW nuclear and involving 25 thermal projects and 56 hydro
projects. Additionally, the construction of some 15,000 circuit kms of 400
kV transmission is planned to enable further integration of the State systems
and the evacuation of the output from the proposed large thermal power sta-
tions over the expanding regional grid systems. Total capital expenditures
on these projects alone would be in the neighborhood of Rs 125 billion (US$14
billion equivalent).
2.20      This would be an unprecedented undertaking and, bearing in mind the
failure to meet the Fourth and Fifth Plan targets, it is doubtful if such an
ambitious program (see Annex 2) can be achieved during the Sixth Plan period.

3. THE BENEFICIARY - NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION LIMITED
3.01      The Borrower of the proposed Credit would be the Government of
India and the Beneficiary would be NTPC. A Development Credit Agreement
would be entered into between GOI and the Association, a Project Agreement
between NTPC and the Association and a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
GOI and NTPC to cover the onlending of the Credit.
3.02      NTPC was established in 1975 under the Companies Act 1956, and
the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 has been amended to give the Corporation
statutory recognition. NTPC is responsible to the Government and has an
initial authorized share capital of Rs 1,250 million (US$140 million). The
Corporation is managed by a Board of Directors of not less than four and
not more than fifteen, some of whom will be part time.
3.03      The main objects for which the Corporation has been established
are:
(i) to design, construct, and operate large central thermal
power stations and projects; and
(ii)  to distribute and sell the power generated.
NTPC would initially own and operate the associated 400 kV transmission
system over which power would be distributed and sold in bulk to State
Electricity Boards. The contractual and tariff structure proposals are
discussed in paragraphs 6.07 and 6.08.
3.04      Initial development planned by NTPC provides for the construction
of two central thermal power stations each with a capacity of 2,000 MW. The
first to be constructed is located at Singrauli on the coal fields in Uttar
Pradesh State and the second is at Korba on the coal fields in Madhya Pradesh.
It is possible that NTPC might also take over the Government owned 300 MW
Badarpur power station near Delhi (ultimate planned capacity 700 MW), present-
ly owned by GOI. The Singrauli development, which includes the proposed pro-
ject for Bank Group financing, is described in detail in Annex 3 and the
Korba development in Annex 4.
Organization and Management
3.05      NTPC's proposed organization is shown in Annex 5.  A start has
been made on building up the establishment and filling key appointments.
The Chairman and Managing Director who is a competent administrator with
wide experience in the formation and development of large industrial under-
takings and in the construction of factories and the manufacture of generat-
ing facilities has been appointed and the Board of Directors comprising five
part time Directors and a full time Director (Finance) has been constituted.
For the time being it is intended to limit the size of the Board to not more



-9-
than eight members. Progress with the appointment of senior staff was dis-
cussed during negotiations and the NTPC representative stated that recruit-
ment of staff at General Manager and senior professional level and essential
administrative staff has commenced with 22 already in position and 68 for
whom the selection process has been completed. General Managers to head the
Singrauli Development and the Technical Services have been appointed as also
have the Deputy General Managers in charge of Civil Design and Construction
and Personnel Training and Administration. Deputy General Managers and Middle
Level Managers in the areas of Erection, Systems Development, Technical
Services and Finance are expected to be appointed early in 1977. It would seem
from the foregoing that satisfactory progress is being maintained in staffing
the Corporation, but the position will be reviewed in detail during the next
mission in the power sector.
3.06      The organizational structure should be viewed at this juncture as
a framework for development in a phased manner over the years. In the early
years, until NTPC has built up a competent establishment with suitably quali-
fied personnel, it will be necessary to draw upon the experience of senior
project management experts such as CEA and/or other consultancy organizations
to supplement the efforts of the Corporation staff. This will be particu-
larly necessary in the case of the Singrauli Thermal Power Project and NTPC
has appointed the Thermal Design Organization of CEA as its prime consultant
for the design of the power station and preparation of specifications. Whilst
CEA is experienced in the design lay-out of 120 MW units its experience with
200 MW units is limited. This matter was discussed during negotiations and
agreement was reached on the appointment of consultants satisfactory to the
Association to review CEA's layout and design proposals and to assist in
the more specialized areas of design. Agreement was also reached on the
employment of consultants satisfactory to the Association to assist NTPC
in the design, preparation of specifications and supervision of construction
of the 400 kV transmission included in the Project.
Training
3.07      Training of engineers and operators for the operation and main-
tenace of thermal stations has been inadequate and this has been reflected
in the under-utilization of generating plant with outages for periods longer
than normally required for maintenance. With the proposed growth of power
generation by the end of the Sixth Plan period involving an increase in the
work force of some 40,000 highly skilled workers, the need for training can-
not be too highly stressed.
3.08      NTPC places special importance on this aspect of its organization
and training programs are to be developed by the Corporation which will be
backed by a training school equipped with simulators and other modern facili-
ties for instructing and training the operating staff.
3.09      GOI has also recognized the problem and the inadequacy of existing
training establishments to meet the demands of the future and has included



- 10 -
electric power training in a UNDP project entitled 'Advanced Vocational Train-
ing System'. Briefly, the objective of this project, which is financed by a
UNDP contribution of a little under US$5 million and an equivalent counterpart
Government contribution in local currency, is to establish new institutions
for advanced vocational training to ensure the steady availability to industry
(including the power industry) of the more critical categories of highly
skilled workers and technicians needed in the long term.
3.10      The first generating units are not scheduled to go into commercial
operation until 1981/82 and the formulation of programs for the instruction
and training of operating staff is not of immediate importance. Nevertheless,
training programs covering pre-operational spheres of activity such as Plan-
ning, Design, Construction, Management, Finance, etc. should be formulated
as soon as possible and these matters will be further discussed with NTPC
during project implementation.
4. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The Project comprises a part of the Singrauli development (see
Annex 3) and consists of:
(a) Civil works comprising acquisition of land, construction
of roads, culverts, railways and other miscellaneous pre-
liminary works, power station and residential buildings,
plant foundations, dams, canals, ducts and other works
associated with the circulating water system;
(b) three 200 MW turbo-generating units and three 680 tonnes/
hr boilers complete with all auxiliaries and ancillary
electrical and mechanical equipment including coal trans-
portation and handling equipment and the switchyard; and
(c)  the 400 kV transmission system comprising two 30 km single
circuit lines from Singrauli to Obra and a 400 km single
circuit line from Obra to Kanpur together with control
bays and other associated equipment.
4.02      The Singrauli 2,000 MW development is to be constructed on the
fringe of the Rihand Reservoir close to the Singrauli coal field deposit
at Kota in the Mirzapur District of Uttar Pradesh. The Project has been
selected as a logical slice of the overall development which, on economic
and engineering considerations, could operate as an independent and viable
project in the event construction of the remaining units aggregating 1,400
MW is delayed or deferred.

Estimated Cost
4.03      The estimated cost of the Singrauli 2,000 MW power station together
with associated transmission is about Rs 10,500 million (about US$1.2 billion
equivalent). The estimated cost of the Project as defined in paragraph 4.01
is Rs 3,573 million (US$397 million), excluding interest during construction.
On the assumption that most contracts will be won by Indian suppliers the
foreign currency component of the Project is estimated at Rs 461 million
(US$51.3 million). The estimated costs of the principal features of the
Project are shown in the following table and in more detail in Annex 6.

Amount of Credit
4.04      The proposed Credit of US$150 million represents about 34% of the
total financing required for the Project. It was agreed during negotiations
that this should be applied to the purchase of specific items of electrical,
mechanical and transmission equipment which are suitable for international
competitive bidding. Provision has also been included in the Credit for the
costs of the consultants appointed to assist CEA in Singrauli design.
Basis for Estimates
4.05      The estimates are based on the cost of 200 MW generating units,
boilers and associated equipment which are presently being manufactured in
India and are under erection at Obra, Badarpur and other thermal power sta-
tions. Transmission estimates are based on the costs of the 400 kV trans-
mission line under construction between Obra and Kanpur and on other 400 kV
construction at present in progress in India. A physical contingency of 10%



- 12 -
has been allowed on civil works and coal transportation equipment to provide
for unforeseen factors and possible delay in project completion. This,
together with a 5% physical contingency on Electrical and Mechanical (E&M) and
transmission costs is considered reasonable. The price contingency of 20% on
all aspects of the Project excluding E&M equipment is based on an estimated
7-8% annually compounded rate of inflation during the period of construction.
In the case of E&M equipment, recent experience has shown that fixed price
tenders are now being obtained for turbogenerators and boilers, and plant
costs have been escalated at 8% per annum to the assessed date of placement of
orders and held constant thereafter. Erection costs have been escalated at
7-8% annually compounded throughout the period of construction. This has
resulted in an overall price contingency of 12% on E&M equipment. Although
low, these price contingencies are considered reasonable in the light of
India's experience and its recent success in containing inflation.
4.06      The power station, switchyard and coal storage are sited in an
area presently occupied by a local village. The villagers will have to be
rehoused but, since most of them will be offered employment in the development
area and will live in Corporation houses, resettlement costs are expected to
be minimal and have been included in the cost of residential housing under
the item "Main Civil Works."
Status of Engineering and Construction
4.07      The Singrauli development comprises a number of major works which
must be carefully coordinated to ensure efficient progress to completion;
coal transportation facilities must be completed ahead of the plant to en-
sure availability of coal for commissioning purposes and likewise the trans-
mission system should be slightly ahead of the first 200 MW generating unit
to facilitate commissioning tests on the unit. The first 200 MW unit is
expected to be in commercial operation from October 1, 1981 and the entire
project comprising three 200 MW units together with associated transmission
is expected to be completed by September 1982. The critical path construc-
tion charts shown in Annexes 7 and 8 set out the construction program for
the power station and transmission respectively on the assumption major power
station contracts can be placed by September 1977 and transmission contracts
by April 1978. With those constraints in mind NTPC has prepared an implement-
ation plan together with a master progress chart so that all aspects of the
project and associated works can be monitored during the construction period.
4.08      Preliminary works are well advanced; site survey, hydrological and
subsoil investigations and land acquisition are in the final stages and model
studies are in hand. NTPC has appointed its prime consultant (see para. 3.06);
the specifications for civil and structural works have been completed and the
preliminary drafts of the turbo-generator and boiler specifications have been
submitted to the Association for comment. Coal studies and dam design are also
proceeding and negotiations are in hand with consultants for the design of the
coal transportation system. In view of the progress to date, there should be no
problem in keeping to the September 1977 deadline for award of major contracts.



- 13 -
4.09      As far as the transmission is concerned NTPC has appointed UPSEB
as its consultant for the design of the Singrauli-Obra-Kanpur 400 kV trans-
mission line. UPSEB has built up a competent design team and is currently
engaged in the design and supervision of erection of some 2,000 kms of 400 kV
transmission lines. Its approach to line and equipment design appears to be
competent, and the Obra-Kanpur section of the Singrauli-Kanpur line (about 400
km out of a total of 460 km) will, subject to modifications suggested by CEA,
duplicate in much of the design detail the 400 kV line presently under con-
struction by UPSEB between Obra and Kanpur. In the circumstances this arrange-
ment is acceptable. UPSEB has carried out a preliminary survey and has com-
pleted the draft specifications for the towers. In view of the progress to
date there should be no problem in keeping to the deadline for placing major
contracts by April 1978.
4.10      NTPC proposes to appoint NHPC to supervise construction of the line.
The rationale for this proposal is that in this way NHPC will be able to build
up a team of experienced staff which would ultimately form the transmission
wing of the Corporation (see para 2.11). This matter was discussed during
negotiations and GOI stressed the need to form the transmission wing of NHPC
as soon as possible, particularly as work would shortly have to commence on
the design and construction of other sections of the proposed 400 kV Central
System in States other than Uttar Pradesh. To this end the Corporation would
be recruiting its staff from UPSEB's competent and experienced organization.
Taking all factors into consideration i.e. the experience of NHPC's Chairman
in extra high voltage transmission line construction, the recruitment of
UPSEB's experienced team and the impending 400 kV construction in other States,
it was agreed that the proposal to use NHPC for supervision of construction of
the Singrauli-Obra-Kanpur line would be acceptable to the Association.
4.11      The coal handling and transportation equipment is part of the
Project and possible delays due to anticipated long delivery on some of the
equipment is recognized in the ordering and construction program. However,
an area over which NTPC has little or no control, is the development of that
block (Jayant) of the Singrauli coal field which is to supply coal for the
Project. This matter was discussed during negotiations and GOI agreed to
take all such steps as shall be necessary to make available adequate coal
supplies for the efficient operation of the Project by the time the first
generating unit under the Project shall have been commissioned.
Procurement
4.12      Procurement of all equipment to be financed from the proposed
Credit would be on the basis of international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Association's guidelines. All bidding documents, including
recommendations for award of contracts, would be prepared by NTPC with the
assistance of its consultants, and approved by the Association. Local manu-
facturers would be expected to bid for all categories of equipment but in-
corporated in Lnese bids would be an indirect foreign cost element covering
specialized material embodied in the major contracts and not yet manufactured
in India. A domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less,



- 14 -
would be applied in bid evaluation. Local manufacturers are likely to win
the majority of contract awards, but to prevent procurement delays GOI agreed
during negotiations that, in the event the lowest evaluated bidder for any
contract is a foreign manufacturer, permission to import will be forthcoming
without further review by any agency of the Government. There are competent
local contracting firms in India and also manufacturing facilities covering
most of the equipment for the Project. Therefore all work not financed wholly
or in part from the proposed Credit will be subject to local procurement pro-
cedures, which are satisfactory.
Disbursements
4.13      Disbursements would be made against the cost of the consultants
retained to assist the Thermal Design Organization of CEA and against the cost
of the equipment to be financed from the proposed Credit on the following
basis:
(a) 100% of the ex-factory cost of equipment procured in
India after international competitive bidding; and
(b) the foreign cost of equipment procured from abroad.
Any balance of the Credit not used after commitments have been made for all
items covered by the list of goods, could be used to purchase other electrical
and mechanical equipment for the Project, after obtaining the Association's
agreement. A disbursement schedule is given in Annex 9.
Ecological Aspects
4.14      The ecological and environmental aspects of the Project were dis-
cussed during negotiations. GOI advised that the Singrauli development had
received the approval of the Indian National Committee on Environmental Plan-
ning and NTPC agreed to comply with all environmental quality standards pres-
cribed by this committee, in the design, construction and operation of the
Project.
4.15      The principal environmental problems with large thermal power
stations are: (a) location, (b) stack emissions, (c) heat dissipation,
and (d) ash removal. These are dealt with below:
(a) Location
The proposed Singrauli power station is a pit head sta-
tion and is situated far from any urban area. Accordingly,
there are no problems in this area other than the need to
ensure the health and environment of the operating staff
who will be housed in a residential area to be constructed
some 4 or 5 kms from the power station.



- 15 -
(b) Stack Emissions
Electrostatic precipitators will be installed and the stack
will be of such a height that emitted particulate matter
will be spread over a sufficiently wide area to reduce
the density of pollutants to an acceptable level. The sulphur
content of the coal is in the range of 0.3% to 0.6% which is
low and does not present a pollution problem.
(c) Heat Dissipation
The cooling pond is designed to ensure that its average
temperature increase will not exceed 3% with the station
under full operation. This would have no adverse effect on
fisheries.
(d) Ash Disposal
The ash will be pumped as a slurry, through a 5 km pipe-
line, to an ash dump area which has been reclaimed from
the Rihand Reservoir. The area will be enclosed by a bund
and together with a reserve area will be adequate to con-
tain the ash output for the life of the power station.
4.16      With regard to the safety and occupational health of employees,
safety regulations for power stations, to which all operating personnel must
conform, will be strictly enforced. As far as noise levels are concerned
the turbine hall of a modern steam turbine power station, which is the noisi-
est area of the plant, has a sound pressure level of less than 90 decibels
and is well under the maximum acceptable threshold for the normal 8 hour/
day shift worker.
5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Power Market
5.01      The demand for power in India and the reason for the slow down in
growth of load during the early 1970's have been discussed in paras. 2.14
and 2.15. The load restrictions which had to be applied during this period,
consequent upon lack of plant capacity, fell mainly on industry where there
is, in consequence, a large element of pent-up demand. This together with the
steady increase in agricultural demand in consequence of the large rural elec-
trification and irrigation programs, is the basis of the Government's conten-
tion that the underlying annual growth rate of 11% - 12% is still there, pro-
vided generating capacity is available to meet it. Bearing in mind the magni-
tude of the development program for the Sixth Plan period, the improved per-
formance during the Fifth Plan period and the better plant utilization which
is now being achieved, CEA considers that, if anything, forecasting an annual
growth rate of 10% for the foreseeable future, is conservative.



- 16 -
The Need for the Singrauli Capacity in the Northern Region
5.02      Load restrictions fell heavily on the Northern Region during the
early 1970's particularly in the case of Uttar Pradesh where plant availa-
bility in 1974, for instance, fell to less than two-thirds of the estimated
requirement and the planned development during the Sixth Plan period
is designed to achieve an acceptable balance between demand and supply by
1983/84. The program is heavy and the inclusion of a 2,000 MW power
station such as Singrauli ensures the availability of a large block of
power in the shortest possible time. Annexes 10 through 13 demonstrate
the need for the Singrauli capacity in the program. -Annex 10 shows how
the Singrauli output will fit into a forecast (Northern Region) daily load
curve during 1984/85 and Annex 11 illustrates the forecast annual load dura-
tion curve (Northern Region) for 1983/84, with the Singrauli plant in its
order of merit. Both of these charts demonstrate that there will be a shor-
tage of capacity and energy availability during those years when full al-
lowance is made for standby, spinning reserve and forced outage. The shortage
is small and should be covered by spinning reserve; nevertheless it is demon-
strated that even with Singrauli, the position is still tight. The chart in
Annex 12 shows the projections of peak demand and installed capacity required
to meet the peak demand of the Northern Region for the Sixth Plan period
(1979/80 through 1983/84), and the table in Annex 13 shows for the Northern
Region, actual and estimated GWh generated, system maximum demand, installed
and firm capacity and productive capability for the period 1970/71 through
1983/84.
Marketing
5.03      It is GOI's intention that 85% of the output of power from the
Singrauli development will be sold to selected States in the Northern
Region (Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and the Delhi Electricity
Supply undertaking (DESU)) (see para 6.08), with the remaining 15% available
for allocation in accordance with emergency requirements from time to time.
The output of power from the three generating units to be constructed under
the Project will be fed into the Uttar Pradesh system at a 400 kV bulk
supply point to be established at Kanpur and it is GOI's intention that 85%
of this power will be sold in agreed portions to the above named selected
States. Bulk supply points will be established in each State and the power,
excluding that sold to UPSEB, will be "wheeled" over the UPSEB system.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.04      The justification for the Singrauli development is based entirely
on the needs of the Northern Region and various alternatives for providing
this power were examined. The possible alternatives are (a) hydro electric,
(b) nuclear, and (c) smaller coal fired thermal stations at load centers to
provide the same amount of power.
5.05      The development of hydroelectric potential was ruled out as a
practicable alternative because of the limitations on time and size, avail-
ability and general remoteness of sites and because most of the ready poten-
tial which has not yet been exploited is already included in the Sixth Plan



- 17 -
for development concurrently with Singrauli. The nuclear alternative was
also eliminated as a practicable alternative because of the physical impossi-
bility of providing the power required in the time span available. This left
the development of a number of smaller coal fired power stations at load
centers as the next best alternative. The comparison of this alternative,
comprising three 700 MW installations, with the proposed Singrauli 2,000 MW
pit head development, is described in detail in Annex 14.
5.06      In making this comparison shadow prices (see para 5.08) were applied
to the cost of foreign exchange and local labor in the case of both alter-
natives and constant fuel prices of Rs 150 per tonne (the 1976 cost of fuel
at Badarpur power station near Delhi) for the smaller power stations and the
1976 national pit head price of Rs 55 per tonne for Singrauli, were assumed.
At discount rates of 10% and 12% the present worth of Singrauli costs was
substantially less than that of the three separate 700 MW installations. The
equalizing discount rate, at which the present worths of both cost streams were
equal, was 32%. These results are sensitive to significant variations in the
most uncertain factors of the two alternatives, but taking the most pessimistic
view (a 10% increase in the cost of Singrauli combined with a 10% decrease in
the cost of fuel for the smaller power stations) still shows the present worth
of Singrauli costs to be the lower at both 10% and 12%, and the equalizing
discount rate is reduced to 15%. These rates are higher than the opportunity
cost of capital in India and demonstrate that development of a large thermal
power station at Singrauli is the most economic of the two alternatives.
5.07      Having established the justification for the 2,000 MW Singrauli
power station, which is to comprise 5 x 200 MW generating units in the first
phase followed by 2 x 500 MW units, a comparison was made between this and a
2,000 MW power station comprising 4 x 500 units constructed in two phases;
2 x 500 MW followed by 2 x 500 MW. On a straight comparison the 2 x 500 MW
units would be some 15% cheaper than the 5 x 200 MW units and additionally
there would be savings in operating and fuel costs. However the largest
generating units in operation at the present time are 120 MW units. Based
on technical considerations it would be unwise and potentially more costly to
proceed in one step to the 500 MW units with their more sophisticated operat-
ing and maintenance procedures. Several 200 MW units are presently being con-
structed in India and some will be in operation by the time the first Singrauli
200 MW unit goes into commercial operation. On a risk analysis basis higher
expected costs would have to be associated with a first phase of two 500 MW
units. These contingent costs are based on the greater likelihood of break-
down with the larger units resulting in longer outage periods and consequent
loss of revenues. This would not apply to the 2 x 500 MW units in the second
phase of the development as by that time generating units of this size are
likely to be manufactured in India and experience should have been gained in
their operation and maintenance. The foregoing considerations favor proceed-
ing first with the 5 x 200 MW installation and justifies this alternative for
the first phase of the development.



- 18 -
Return on Investments
5.08      An internal rate of return on the 2,000 MW Singrauli power station
plus associated transmission costs was estimated in order to demonstrate the
relationship between the revenues implied by the proposed tariff policy and
the economic cost of the project (see Annex 14). For the purposes of this
calculation, which equates the present worth of project costs with the present
worth of attributable revenues, both costs and revenues are at 1976 prices,
foreign exchange is valued at Rs 11/US$, labor is valued at 70% of the actual
wage rate, and taxes and duties are excluded. On these assumptions, the
return, estimated at 10%, suggests that the bulk supply price will be roughly
equal to marginal cost, thereby encouraging the SEBs to adjust their own
tariffs to reflect economic costs. While such a pricing policy is a necessary
step toward rationalization of power tariffs in India, reform of pricing at
the SEB level is also required if wasteful consumption of energy and premature
expansion of capacity is to be avoided, and analyses of SEB tariff policies
are thus necessary. Several SEB's including Uttar Pradesh are already under-
taking pricing studies based on marginal cost principles and it is expected
that the other States (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and DESU), which are to be
allocated power from the Singrauli development, will follow suit. GOI has
promised to take all steps possible to obtain such an undertaking from each
of these States.
6. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
6.01      The financial forecasts of NTPC's operations through FY 1988 are
presented in Annexes 15-17. They are based on NTPC's capital investment
program for the period through FY 1987 which comprises the construction of two
2,000 MW thermal power stations, one at Singrauli in Uttar Pradesh and one at
Korba in Madhya Pradesh, and about 4,500 circuit kms of associated 400 kV
transmission.
6.02      The forecast dates for commissioning the generating units for
operations are detailed in Annex 15 page 2, which shows that by October 1982
the first three 200 MW units, which form part of the project at Singrauli,
would be commissioned together with the first 200 MW unit at Korba. Further
construction of plant by NTPC beyond the completion of these two power sta-
tions and their associated transmission is not included in NTPC's investment
program in view of the possibility that GOI may set up additional centrally
owned power generating corporations (para 2.10). However NTPC agreed during
negotiations to inform the Association in the event it acquires any asset
valued at Rs 50 crores or more.



- 19 -
Future Earnings
6.03      NTPC's future earnings forecasts assume that it will supply bulk
power at 400 kV to State Electricity Boards at prices which would cover
NTPC's operation and maintenance, management expenses, interest, and a
reasonable earned surplus. To meet this situation GOI and NTPC agreed to
achieve in FY 1988 1/ and maintain thereafter a rate of return of not less
than 9-1/2% on the original cost of its average net fixed assets in service,
and in the meantime to set tariffs from the time of the commissioning of the
first generating unit at levels not lower than those estimated each year
which are required to achieve a 9-1/2% return in FY 1988.
6.04      The income statement (Annex 15) shows the forecast average bulk
supply price of 22.1 paise per kWh (excluding fuel surcharge), calculated
on the basis of the FY 1988 forecasts. This price is used in determining
the annual forecast revenues in the earlier years, FY 1982 through FY 1987.
Although operating losses are forecast in both FY 1982 and FY 1983 NTPC's
internal cash generation (Annex 16) in those years would exceed its debt
service. As the capacity of the generating plant continues to increase,
NTPC's annual revenues will increase faster than its operating expenses,
and NTPC would be expected to achieve a rate of return of 0.6% in 1982 and
3.7% in 1983 rising gradually to the agreed 9.5% by FY 1988. As NTPC's cash
flow would cover its debt service requirements in that period, its lower
earnings in the initial years of operation of Singrauli and Korba would be
acceptable.
6.05      NTPC is unlikely to become liable for tax on its earnings until
after FY 1988 because the deductibles allowed for annual depreciation in
assessing taxable income each year are based on a fixed percentage of the
declining balances, and not on the straight line method which is used in
preparing the income statements. Any loss assessed in a given year can
be carried forward and deducted from a subsequent year's profits before
determining the tax liability in that year. No provision is made for the
payment of dividends while the Corporation continues to carry forward losses
for tax purposes to subsequent years of assessment.
6.06      Several SEBs who are expected to enter into long term contracts
for the purchase of power from NTPC (Uttar Pradesh SEB, Punjab SEB, Harayana
SEB, Rajasthan SEB and DESU) did not achieve a 9-1/2% rate of return on a
rate base valued at historic cost by the target dates agreed under earlier
Association credits. The delay is attributable mainly to monsoon failures
in FY 1974 and FY 1975, to their losses from rural electrification opera-
tions, and to inflationary conditions. The Government has requested that
the target dates be revised to FY 1977 for Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh
and to FY 1979 for Harayana and DESU. The proposed structure of the Bulk
Supply Tariff is discussed in the following paragraphs.
1/   The first year in which the 2000 MW Singrauli power station should
be in full commercial operation.

Bulk Supply Tariff
6.07      NTPC will, in due course, enter into long term contracts with
the recipient SEBs for the sale of bulk power. The general principles
which should be followed in establishing bulk supply tariffs are discussed
in Annex 19. In view of the pattern of future development in the power
sector with possibly another two large Central thermal power stations in
varying stages of commissioning and a National System Load Despatch organi-
zation in operation by the time the Singrauli Development is completed, the
formulation of a bulk tariff policy is likely to be complicated by the dif-
ferent types of bulk transfers which will, by then, be involved, and as a
consequence it would be premature to go beyond a brief outline of principles
at this juncture. This will be the subject of continuing dialogue during
future missions.
6.08      The general principle of a bulk supply tariff which, ideally,
should consist of an annual demand charge per kW of capacity allocated
based on total fixed costs (which would be a minimum charge) plus an energy
charge which reflects short-run marginal costs was discussed with GOI at the
time of appraisal. This principle is agreed by GOI and it was also agreed
that from time to time such a bulk tariff would have to be revised to take
account of changes in both fixed and variable costs and to meet any increase in
the rate of return target. GOI's proposal is that 85% of the power would be
allocated, the remaining 15% being sold in accordance with priorities,
to be determined by CEA, to States with the greatest need. The most important
consideration is to protect NTPC's revenues to ensure that income from the
sale of bulk power will be adequate at all times to meet fixed and variable
costs and provide the agreed rate of return. To the extent that there is
likely to be a continuing capacity shortage for the foreseeable future, GOI's
proposal outlined above would be acceptable for the Project, comprising the
first 600 MW of a planned 2,000 MW power station. During negotiations, NTPC
agreed to sell the output of power from the Project to SEBs under bulk supply
contracts satisfactory to the Association and GOI agreed to take all steps
within the power available to it to obtain from the selected SEBs not later
than September 30, 1977 an undertaking satisfactory to the Association, and
endorsed by the State Government in each case, to purchase, in aggregate, not
less than 85% of the output of power from the Project.
Financing Plan (FY 1977 through FY 1988)
6.09      Forecast source and application of funds statements covering NTPC's
operations for FY 1977 through FY 1988, are shown in Annex 16. NTPC's finan-
cing plans for the Project construction period (FY 1978 to FY 1983) provide
for:
Generation Plant
(a) The construction and completion of:
(i) three 200 MW generating units at Singrauli which
form part of the proposed Project; and



- 21 -
(ii) one 200 MW generating unit at Korba.
(b) Work in varying stages of progress on six additional
200 MW units, and four 500 MW units at Singrauli and
Korba.
Transmission
(a) The construction and completion of the 400 kv transmission
lines viz:
(i) Singrauli/Obra/Kanpur - 460 circuit kms, which
forms part of the proposed Project;
(ii) Korba/Koradi - 900 circuit kms.
(b) Work in varying stages of progress on the remaining transmission
lines - 1,550 circuit kms associated with Singrauli and 1,600
circuit kms associated with Korba.

6.11      This financing plan includes provision for the cost of construc-
tion of the Project estimated at US$441 million equivalent (Annex 6). The
Association would provide US$150 million and the GOI would provide the



- 22 -
balance. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOI would provide
the balance of capital, estimated at US$291 million, to complete the Project,
on terms satisfactory to the Association together with any additional funds
due to cost overruns or other unforeseeable factors which may arise.
6.12      The total construction expenditure in the financing plan would
amount to US$2,111 million equivalent, of which the cost of the proposed
Singrauli Project would represent about 20%. GOI would provide the capital
required by NTPC in the form of debt and equity in a ratio not exceeding
50/50. Its loans to NTPC would be repayable over 15 years following grace
periods of up to 5 years, and carrying interest on outstanding loans at
10-1/4% per annum.
Internal Cash Generation - FY 1984 through FY 1988
6.13      After commencing commercial operations in October 1981, NTPC's
annual internally generated funds would increase rapidly to Rs 2,876 million
(US$320 million) by FY 1988. They would cover annual debt service by 1.1
times in FY 1982 and FY 1983 rising to 1.6 times by FY 1988 (Annex 16). The
following table illustrates the rapid rise in internally generated funds net
of debt service and working capital increases which reflects the operation
of the new plant and the tapering off of the investment program (Annex 16,
page 2).

6.14      Internal cash generation is based on plant having an average annual
load factor of 63% when fully developed, on energy sales priced at 22.1 paise
per kWh, operating and maintenance expenses expressed as a percentage of
capital cost (Annex 18) and the investment program as currently forecast.
The surplus cash would arise in FY 1987 and FY 1988 mainly because the invest-
ment program does not provide additional construction following the construc-
tion of the Singrauli and Korba Power Stations and the associated 400 kV
transmission network, and also because no provision is made for the payment
of dividends.



- 23 -
Estimated Future Finances
6.15      Forecast condensed balance sheets as at March 31, 1977 through
March 31, 1982, reflect the construction of plant, and the result of com-
mercial operation of the first 200 MW generating unit from October 1, 1981.
By March 31, 1982 NTPC's capitalization would be Rs 14,640 million (US$1,626
million equivalent) divided between GOI loans (including the relending of the
Associations' credit) and equity in a ratio of 45/55. This would be satis-
factory. On completion of the plant in FY 1987 the gross plant value would
exceed Rs 25,000 million (US$2,780 million ). Annex 17 assumes NTPC's
authorized share capital would be increased to Rs 6,000 million in FY 1979
and Rs 12,000 million in FY 1982.
6.16      NTPC's debt equity ratio rises to 50/50 in FY 1984, then reduces
gradually to 38/62 by FY 1988. This reflects the reduced borrowings as
the investment program tapers off and retained earnings are added to equity.
Audit
6.17      The appointment of an independent auditor to audit the NTPC books,
would be made by the Company Law Audit Board, on the recommendation of the
Auditor General of India. He would normally be a member of the Indian Insti-
tute of Chartered Accountants and his audit report on NTPC's financial state-
ments would be subject to comment by the Auditor General.  During negotia-
tions NTPC undertook to submit to the Association audited financial statements
within 7 months of the close of the year to which they relate, together with a
certified report by the independent auditor, and the review of the accounts by
the Director of Commercial Audit.

SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Organization of the Power Supply Industry
The manner in which the electricity supply industry is at present
organized was broadly determined by the provisions of the Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948. In particular, the Act provided for the establishment of what
are now the principal agencies in the industry, the State Electricity Boards
(SEBs). The SEBs were assigned responsibility for the generation, transmis-
sion and distribution of electricity within each State, and for the control
and regulation of other supply undertakings which were private licensees.
This responsibility includes the construction of new power stations and the
operation and extension of the systems within each State. Private licensees
operate mostly in urban areas and their relative importance in the sector is
expected to diminish over time. At present the State Authorities effectively
own or control the sources of well over 90 percent of electricity supply by
utilities; in addition, their sanction is required for the installation of
all captive plants within their borders.
As originally conceived, the SEBs were to be autonomous public
corporations, responsible for running their own operations subject only
to broad instructions and guidance in policy matters from State Governments.
In practice, the SEBs have been very much under the control of the State
Governments, rather along the lines of the Public Works Departments in which
most of them have their origins. One symptom of this dependence, and at
the same time a factor which helps to maintain it, is the financial weakness
of most SEBs.
The Indian power sector is complex because electricity supply is
within the concurrent jurisdiction of the Central Government and the State
Governments, according to the Constitution and to the Electricity (Supply)
Act, 1948. Thus, while the Act assigned extensive responsibilities to the
State authorities, it also provided for broad guidance and coordination
from the Center. These were to be supplied by a Central Electricity Authority
(CEA), which was to be responsible for developing a national policy for power
development and for coordinating the activities of the various planning
agencies involved in electricity supply. But although the CEA was formally
created in 1950, it has, until recently, remained for the most part inopera-
tive, without staff of its own and with no clear and accepted function to
perform.
For most of the electricity supply industry, the Central Government
agency most involved until recently was the Ministry of Irrigation and Power
specifically, the Power Wing of its Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC).
However, as a result of administrative changes introduced in October 1974,
responsibility for power now comes under the Ministry of Energy, which is



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4 pages
also in charge of the coal mining industry. For atomic energy, and hence
for nuclear power generation, there was and remains a separate Department
of Atomic Energy which comes directly under the Prime Minister. Until
recently, the CWPC was responsible through its Power Wing for the implementa-
tion of Central as opposed to State or private power schemes. In relation
to the latter it undertook such functions as appraisal of projects proposed
by the SEBs, provision of technical advice and consultancy services on all
aspects of power design and engineering. Its effectiveness in this capacity
was, however, constrained by an important limitation which does not bind the
CEA, the CWPC being simply a technical advisory subordinate agency of the
Ministry of Energy. It had no formal status independent of the responsible
Ministry (as does the CEA), and no powers to direct or control or to carry
out independent investigations of its own. To achieve its objectives it
relied solely upon its powers of "persuasion." In connection with the power
Transmission III Project (Credit 377-IN of May 1973), the GOI agreed its
understanding that further Bank Group financial assistance to the sector
would be contingent upon a meaningful reactivation of the CEA.
Following the establishment in October 1974 of the Ministry of
Energy, the functions of the Central Water and Power Commission were split;
the irrigation function being transferred to the Central Water Commission
reporting to the Ministry of Agriculture and the power function being
transferred to the CEA reporting to the Ministry of Energy. This involved
the transfer of the Power Wing of the former CWPC to the CEA. Much still
requires to be done to complete "reactivation" but an important step forward
has been taken. The extent to which the CEA will be able to ensure effective
implementation of its recommendations by State Authorities remains to be seen,
but its reactivation represents an important step toward an integrated national
approach to the power sector.
The Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 has been suitably amended to
enlarge the scope and the functions of the CEA. In addition to its general
duty of developing a sound, adequate and uniform national power policy and
coordinating the activities of the planning agencies in relation to the con-
trol and utilization of national power resources, new functions have been
assigned to it, e.g. formulation of short-term and perspective plans for
power development, training of personnel, interconnected system operations
and research and development. The amendments also cover the establishment
of generating companies by the Central Government as well as by State Govern-
ments to build up expertise in the field of generation to enable construction
of generating stations in a shorter time and to operate them with greater
efficiency. An ordinance incorporating the agreed amendments to the general
provisions of the Act was issued on October 8, 1976, and other amendments to
the financial provisions of the Act, which concern the financial operations
of the SEBs, were approved by the Cabinet in December 1976. Legislative
enactment of the amendments is expected,probably by mid 1977.
An order dated August 12, 1975, promulgated by the President of
India, details the new organizational structure of the CEA and describes



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4 pages
the functions of its Chairman and Members. Although the order gives immediate
effect to the new organization, the appointment of the full complement of
members is subject to legislative enactment of the amendments to the Act
referred to in the preceding paragraph.
The CEA will consist of not more than seven full-time members
including its Chairman and not more than six part-time members, all appointed
by the Central Government. The full-time members are required to have ex-
perience of, and have shown capacity in the design, construction, operation
and maintenance of generating stations or transmission and distribution of
electricity, applied economics, industrial, commercial or financial matters
or applied research in the field of electricity. The Chairman is to be
responsible for the overall coordination and control over the functioning
of the CEA; administration, research and development; and all matters rela-
ting to the legal aspects of the Electricity (Supply) Act and the Indian
Electricity Act and Rules. Members with appropriate qualifications are to
be responsible for planning, power systems, thermal and hydroelectric design
and construction, operations and economic and commercial matters. Part-
time members are to be appointed from time to time to assist the CEA in
specialized fields. Four of the full-time members have already been trans-
ferred to the CEA from the former CWPC and the Chairman has been appointed.
In order to ensure that well-qualified personnel are selected for the remain-
ing posts the GOI is proceeding cautiously.
Other agencies at the Center are also concerned in the decisions
relating to the planning and financing of electric power.  In particular,
the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission are involved in the
appraisal and sanction of major power projects and in the fliancial provi-
sions for investment in electricity supply. Since the powe- supply industry
is highly capital-intensive and has grown in India at an ext. wmely rapid rate,
it has taken a consistently large share of aggregate investment. The invest-
ment program in the power sector is necessarily a matter of continuing concern
to the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Commission, because of the large
amounts involved.
Generating Companies and Regional Integration
In view of the immense task of providing sufficient generating
capacity to meet the requirements of the Sixth Plan period (FY 1980 through
FY 1984), the GOI proposes to supplement the efforts of the States by con-
structing a number of large generating stations. For this purpose, two
Central generating companies, one for hydro and the other for thermal plant
have been established. These have been set up under the Companies Act and
are accountable to the GOI through the Ministry of Energy for the construc-
tion, ownership and operation of large Central thermal and hydro generating
facilities whi-h ;ould provide bulk power to neighboring States. Power
would be transferred over an interconnected 400 kV transmission system which
will, initially, be owned and operated by the National Thermal Power Corpora-
tion Ltd. (NTPC). It is believed that these new large facilities will help



ANNEX 1
Page 4 of 4 pages
to speed attainment of meaningful regional integrated operation. The selection
of the senior executives for the two  -panies is being processed by the Public
Enterprises Selection Board; the Chairri,_,; of both have been appointed. As
certain statutory rights are to be ac7signed to them, the required amendments
to the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 to give them such statutory recognition
are included in the general amendments which became law in October 1976.
These amendments also cover the setting up of generating companies by State
Governments with a view to optimizing generation and developing professional
expertise in the construction, operation and maintenance of generating stations
and associated transmission lines. Also likely to help accelerate the inte-
gration of regional operations is a US$1.6 million equivalent UNDP - assisted
project designed to help the CEA establish a System Operations Organization
capable of meeting the future coordination and control needs of the Indian
electricity supply system, and to provide modern training in the field of
load dispatching.
Regional Electricity Boards
As means of improving collaboration between the SEBs, and establishing
power systems on a regional rather than a State basis, five Regional Electricity
Boards were formed during the period 1964-66. The general functions of the
Boards are to review the progress of regional power development schemes, plan
the integrated operation of the constituent power systems for the maximum
benefit of the regions as a whole, coordinate overhaul and maintenance programs,
determine generation schedules to be followed and the power available from time
to time for transfer between States and determine a suitable tariff structure
to govern exchange of power within the region. To carry out these functions,
each Regional Board is staffed by personnel transferred from the constituent
SEBs. For example, in the case of the Southern Regional Electricity Board
this consists of a Member-Secretary, two Superintending Engineers, seven
Executive Engineers, two Assistant Directors, fourteen Assistant Executive
Engineers and supporting technical staff. The Boards are nominally subject
to CEA control, but in practice they function mainly in an advisory role to
the SEBs, over which they have no executive authority. Thus, the extent to
which regional planning can be undertaken depends on the interests and atti-
tudes of the individual constituent SEBs and of their State Governments. The
progress of collaboration has been greatest in the Southern Region, where the
regional load dispatch center at Bangalore has successfully encouraged the
exchange of power between State networks and made possible a higher utiliza-
tion of plant capacity within the region. Other regions are moving more
slowly to effective collaboration, but in all regions regional and State
load dispatch stations are being set up (most of the equipment for which has
been, or will be, financed by Credits 242-IN, 377-IN, and 604-IN). The ulti-
mate aim is the establishment of an all-India grid with a central system
operations organization, under the direction of which, the Regional Boards
would operate.

Transmission Appraisal Report (Credit No. 604-IN).

SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Description of the Singrauli Development
1.        The Singrauli development is the first of a series of large
thermal power stations, planned by the Government of India, to feed into
a 400 kV interconnected transmission system and supply bulk power to the
State Electricity Boards (SEBs).
The Singrauli 2,000 MW power station is to be installed on the
fringe of the Rihand Reservoir adjacent to the extensive Singrauli coal
fields at Kota in the Mirzapur District of Uttar Pradesh.
2.        The plant will consist of 5 x 200 MW and 2 x 500 MW generating
units with boiler plant, ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment and
associated 400 kV transmission. The first stage of the development will
conrprise the 5 x 200 MW installation.
3.        The 200 MW turbines will be three cylinder, tandem compound
3,000 rpm, double flow exhaust type reheat units operating at 130 kg/cm
Twith a temperature of 535 0C.  The generators will be of the hydrogen cooled
type and will each be rated at 235,300 kVA. The boilers will be natural
circulation, pulverized fuel fired, balanced draft type using the direct
firing system. Each boiler will have a continuous evaporation rating of
680 tonnes/hr. with a superheater outlet pressure of 139 kg/cm2 and temperature
of 540 C. Each 200 MW generating unit will be connected to its own 250 MVA
transformer and will feed power into the 400 kV system.
4.        Local manufacture of the 500 MW turbines is anticipated by the
time these are required. These are likely to be four cylinder tandem conpound
type with operating parameters much the same as for the 200 MW units. Boilers
would be of a similar type to the smaller units except that each boiler would
have a continuous evaporation rating of 1,680 tonnes/hr.with a superheater
outlet pressure of 178 kg/cm2 and temperature of 540 0C.
5.        The salient features of the development are shown below:
POWER STATION
Capacity            -  Initial 2000 W (in two stages) with possible
ultimate capacity of 3000 NW (5 x 200 MW plus
4 x 500 MW).
Fuel                -  Coal from the Singrauli coal fields located
within 3 to 6 kms. Consunption of 2000 MW
power station at 70% LF is about 7 million
torrsa year. The calorific value of the
coal averages 4000 Kcal/kg, it has an ash
content of 30-40% and a moisture content of



Annex 3
Page 2 of 2 pages
10-12% at 60% relative humidity and
40 OC temperature.
Transport of Coal        -  Double track unit train continuous
system with continuous bottom discharging
wagons.
Cooling System           -  The source of water is the Rihand Reservoir
and open pond cooling is achieved by
creating a sub reservoir with the construc-
tion of an earth rockfill dam 10.16 km long
giving a surface area of 12 square miles and
a catchment area of 40 square miles. The
level of water in the sub reservoir would
be maintained at a maximum height of 885 feet
and a minimum of 880 feet. The intake channel
would be 200 meters long and the offtake
channel would be about 7.2 kms long,with an
intermediate discharge point at 2.4 kms,and
would be designed to carry a discharge of
3500 cusecs.
Ash Disposal             -  Ash is pumped as a slurry through a pipe to
the ash disposal area (2000 acres) situated
about 5 kms from the power station. The
area is reclaimed from the Rihand Reservoir
and is contained within an eirth bund 12 kms
long.
Land                     -  A total of 3685 acres will be acquired:
550 acres for the power station, switchyard
coal storage and auxiliaries and 800 acres
for the residential area. The balance
consists principally of the ash disposal
area.

KORBA THERMAL ?O0WER PROJECT
Description of the Korba Development & Estimate of Costs
1.        The Korba project is the second planned development in a series
of large thermal power stations, proposed by the Government of India (GOI),
to feed into a 400 kV interconnected transmission system and supply bulk
power to the State Electricity Boards (SEBs). GOI proposes to construct
Korba concurrently with the Singrauli development but with commencement of
work and commissioning of units lagging one year behind Singrauli. In the
case of Korba, major contract awards are planned for September 1978 (Singrauli,
September 1977), and commissioning of the last unit is scheduled for October
1986 (Singrauli, October 1985).
2.        Basically the Korba power station is identical with Singrauli, the
only variation being in the cooling water system and possibly, the coal
transportation system (it has still to be decided whether this should be by
unit train or by conveyor/ropeway). The proposed site is on the right bank
of the Hasdeo River, in the Bilaspur District of Madhya Pradesh just downstream
of an existing barrage at Darri. The selection is governed by its proximity
to the coal deposits in the Kusmunda Blocks and the adjoining irrigation canal
which can be used for the direct cooling system. The water would be passed
back directly into the canal during the irrigation season and when the canal
is closed it would be passed out into a pond for natural cooling. The canal
is designed for a flow of 3,000 cusecs which will provide adequate cooling
for 1,800 MW during the irrigation season. There might therefore be a need
for a cooling tower for a 200 MW unit to make up the 2,000 MW. There will
also be problems in the provision of adequate ponding when the irrigation
canal is closed. Additionally, development of the coal deposits is not nearly
so advanced as is the case with Singrauli, and the ash storage area has yet
to be established. It is obvious therefore that further detailed investigations
are necessary before power station design can proceed.
3.        The plant will consist of 5 x 200 MW and 2 x 500 MW generating units
with boiler plant, ancillary electrical and mechanical equipment and associated
400 kV transmission. The first stage of the development will comprise the
5 x 200 MW installation.
4.        The 200 MW turbines will be three cylinder, tandem compound
3,000 rpm, double flow exhaust type reheat units operating at 130 kg/cm2
with a temperature of 535 C. The generators will be of the hydrogen cooled
type and will each be rated at 235,300 kVA. The boilers will be natural
circulation, pulverized fuel fired, balanced draft type using the direct
firing system. Each boiler will have a continuous evaporation rating of
680 tonnes/hr. with a superheater outlet pressure of 139 kg/cm2 and tempera-
ture of 540 OC. Each 200 MW generating unit will be connected to its own
250 MVA transformer and will feed power into the 400 kV system.

5.        Local manufacture of the 500 MW turbines is anticipated by the
time these are required. These are likely to be four cylinder tandem compound
type with operating parameters much the same as for the 200 MN units. Boilers
would be of a similar type to the smaller units except that each boiler would
have a continuous evaporatiop rating of 1,680 tonnes/hr. with a superheater
outlet pressure of 178 kg/cm and temperature of 540 c.
6.        The salient features of the development are shown below:
POWER STATION
Capacity            -  Initial 2000 MW (in two stages) with possible
ultimate capacity of 3000 MW (5 x 200 MW plus
4 x 500 W).
Fuel                -  Coal from the Kusmunda Blocks at Korba located
within 3 to 5 ims from the proposed site.
Consumption of 2000 NW power station at 70%
LF is about 7 million tonnes a year.
The calorific value of the coal varies from
3200 to 4200 Kcal/kg, it has an ash content
varying from 34 to 46% and a moisture content
of 10% at 60% relative humidity and 40 C
temperature.
Transport of Coal  -  To be decided--either by double track unit
train, aerial ropeway or belt conveyor.
Cooling System      -  The source of water will be the right bank
irrigation canal during the irrigation
season augmented with cooling towers, with
pondage during the period of the year when
the irrigation canal is closed.
Ash Disposal        -  Ash will be pumped as a slurry through a
pipe to an ash disposal area yet to be
established.
Land                -  A total of some 1000 acres will be required--
Land not yet acquired.

ANNEX 14
Page 1 of 5 pages
INDIA
SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
The Economic Justification of the Project
The Return on Investment
1.      The internal rate of return on the 2,000 MW Singrauli super thermal
power station, plus associated transmission costs, which is estimated in
this Annex, demonstrates the relationship between the revenues implied by
the proposed tariff policy and the economic cost of the project. For
the purpose of this calculationr, plant availability is assumed to be somewhat
lower than that assumed in the estimate of long run marginal costs, shadow
prices are used to reflect scarcity of foreign exchange and abundance of
labor, and taxes are excluded.
2.      Costs and revenues, which are listed on page 4 of this Annex,
are at constant (1976) prices, and revenues are based, not upon prices
that reflect incremental costs, but upon those required to meet the financial
requirements of NTPC. On the assumption that Singrauli will be used for base
load throughout its life, the internal rate of return of the project is estimated
at about 10%.
3.      There is much evidence to suggest that this estimate of the rate of
return is conservative. It is not possible to estimate with any accuracy the
full impact on the ultimate beneficiaries when they cannot be identified,
as in the case of a bulk supply project. Furthermore, in an environment of
intermittent shortages that constrain industrial and agricultural production,
the bulk supply tariffs used to estimate the internal rate of return will
underrepresent the opportunity value of power at the margin, if, as is likely,
the effect of the shortages in constraining demand is greater than the effect
of the generally low level of tariffs among the SEBs is stimulating demand.
flowever, in view of the fact that a bulk supply tariff was used in the
estimation, and that pricing at the retail level is not based on economic
costs, it cannot be asserted that, even if actually realized, such a return
is sufficient to demonstrate that the rate of system expansion is optimal.
4.      The bulk supply tariff which was used satisfies the financial require-
ments and is very close to the long run marginal economic cost of power from
the project. This was estimated using a discount rate of 10%. Thus, it
should not be surprising that, when this tariff is used as a measure of
benefits, and costs have been marginally adjusted in the manner outlined
above, the estimated internal rate of return is very close to the original
discount rate.



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 5 pages
Selection of the Most Economic Alternative
5.      The alternatives to the Singrauli 2,000 MW development which were
examined were development to a similar capacity by (i) hydro, (ii) nuclear,
and (iii) continuation of development by the SEBs involving the installa-
tion of smaller power stations located at load centers. The hydro alter-
native was examined carefully and rejected as a feasible alternative
because of the limitation on size, the time taken to construct, the number
of these projects which would be required to meet an equivalent demand,
the general remoteness of the sites, and also because most of the ready
potential which has not already been exploited is included, in any case
in the Sixth Plan, for development concurrently with Singrauli. The nuclear
alternative was also eliminated as a practicable alternative because of the
physical impossibility of providing the power required in the time span
available. This left a continuation of development by the SEBs of smaller
power stations (or extending existing installations) located at the load
centers as the next best alternative.
6.      The cost streams of the two strategies have been compared and the
Singrauli program proves to be the most economic alternative (see page 5
of this Annex). This program provides for the installation of 5 x 200 MW
and 2 x 500 MW generating units together with 2,000 circuit kms of associated
transmission, the generating units to be progressively commissioned during
the period 1981/82 through 1985/86; by which time the full output would be
taken up. The total cost of the program includes operation and maintenance
of power station plant at 2% of capital cost (transmission 0.5%) and constant
fuel costs based on the Singrauli pit head price of Rs 55 per tonne 1/ and
estimated consumption of 0.59 kg/kWh (1.31 lbs/kWh). This program is
characterized by heavy expenditure during the early years due to costs of
the power station and transmission but low expenditure after 1983/84 because
investment ceases and fuel costs with pit head generation are low.
7.      The alternative construction program provides for the construction
of three 700 MW power stations at selected load centers, with no associated
transmission and with all units progressively commissioned over a similar
period to the Singrauli development. The total cost of this program includes
the cost of operation and maintenance based on 2% of capital costs, as in the
case of Singrauli, and constant fuel costs in 1976 prices at the Delhi-Badarpur
power station of Rs 150 per tonne 1/. Adjustment was made for lower losses (no
transmission losses) when calculating fuel costs, and fuel consumption, on the
assumption of usage of coal with a higher calorific value, was taken as
0.55 kg/kWh (1.21 lbs/kWh). This program was characterized by lower capital
costs than Singrauli in the early years but substantially higher fuel costs
later.
1/ An additional 5% has to be added to fuel costs to cover the cost of oil
for starting and low load operation.

8.      The comparison between the above two alternatives based on net
benefit streams discounted at 10% and 12% showed, at both rates, that
the present value of the costs of Singrauli was substantially lower than
those of the next best alternative. The equalizing discount rate was 32%.
9.      The sensitivity  of the equalizing discount rate was analyzed by
changing the main variables -- capital costs and fuel costs, but the margin
between the present worths of the two strategies was so large that taking
the pessimistic view (a 10% increase in the capital cost of Singrauli and
a 10% decrease in the assumed cost of coal in the case of the alternative
strategy) still shows the present worth of Singrauli costs are lower than
the alternative at both discount rates. The equalizing discount rate in
this case falls to 15%.
10.     The principal factor contributing to this result is the substantial
saving in fuel costs with pit head generation.
Shadow Pricing
11.     The rate of return calculations and the comparison of alternatives
described in this Annex arebased on shadow pricing.  For this purpose,
it has been assumed that 30% of local costs represent labor costs and
these have been shadow priced at 70% of the actual wage rate. Foreign
exchange costs which have been taken as 20% of total costs have been shadow
priced at an exchange rate of Rs 11.0/US$ compared with the market rate
of Rs 9.01US$l. These estimates represent the best estimate of shadow prices
available at the present time.

INDIA
SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
NATIONAL THERMAL POWER CORPORATION
Assumptions on Financial Projections
1.        The financial statements in this report cover the electricity
supply operations for each year through FY 1988 in respect of the newly
established NTPC. They include income statements (Annex 15) source and
application of funds (Annex 16) and condensed balance sheets as of
March 31 each year (Annex 17). The following assumptions are made.
Income Statements (Annex 15)
2.        (a)  Re - Singrauli and Korba:
- Load factor - 63% when fully developed.
- Price of coal (1976) - Rs 55 per Tonne.
- Coal consumption - 0.59 kg per KWh.
- Energy used in plant - 10% of KWh generated.
- 0 & M Expenses - 2% on capital cost.
- Depreciation - straight line method of depreciation
calculated at 3.6% of the original cost of
depreciable assets, after allowing 10% for salvage
value in accordance with the Electricity (Supply)
Act 1948.
(b) Transmission
- 0 & M Expenses - assessed at one half of one percent
of the original cost.
- Depreciation - assessed on the straight line basis,
using 3.6% of 90% of the original cost of depre-
ciable assets.
- Losses - 2% of KWh sent out.
Tariffs
3.        NTPC has an obligation to set tariffs to achieve a rate of return
of not less than 9% on its average net assets in service by FY 1988, and
meantime from the commencement of its commercial operations to set tariffs
at levels not lower than those estimated each year to be required to achieve
a 9% rate of return in FY 1988. On this basis the average price of
22.1 paise per kWh calculated on the FY 1988 estimates are assumed as
the average price for all sales from October 1, 1981.



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 3 pages
Fuel Surcharge
4.         The average revenue of 22.1 paise per kWNlh for power supplied by
Singrauli and Korba is based on the 1976 coal price at Rs 55 per Tonne 1/
escalated at 5% per annum to FY 1981. Thereafter, a fuel clause is assumed
in the bulk supply contract to permit adjustment to meet variation in fuel
costs. The effect of any price variation is shown separately in the forecast
revenues and expenses in Annex 15.
Rate Base
5.         Construction costs are based on 1976 prices.  These have been
escalated at the rate of 8% per annum through FY 1979 and at 7% per annum
thereafter.
Borrowing
6.         The proposed credit would be relent by GOI to NTPC for a period
of 15 years, repayable following a 5 years grace period in 30 equal semi-
annual installments of principal together with interest on the unpaid
balances at the rate of 104% per annum.
7.         Apart from a small amount of internal cash generation, it is
assumed that the remaining capital required by NTPC would be borrowed from
GOI provided that the outstanding indebtedness at the end of subsequent
financial years would not exceed the sum of the issued share capital and
the accumulated retained earnings.
8.         GOI loans are not normally granted on a project basis and with-
drawn by the borrower over the several years of construction, but are usually
related to an annual slice of the borrower's investment program. It is
assumed that each GOI loan to NTPC would be associated with an identifiable
piece of plant, so that the grace period before the loan commences to be
repaid may be conveniently fixed from the date of the loan to a convenient
date following the forecast date of commissioning of the plant. For example,
in the case of the construction of the Korba/Koradi transmission line, three
GOI loans are forecast, one in each of the years FY 1980, FY 1981 and
FY 1982. Grace periods of 3 years, 2 years, 1 year respectively are assumed
before repayment of the loans would commence from April 1, 1983, six
months after 30 September, 1982 the forecast commissioning date. Interest
up to the commissioning date would be charged to construction. Repayment of
GOI loans other than the relending of the IDA credit are assumed following
grace periods of up to 5 years, on the basis of 30 equal semi-annual install-
ments of prtncipal together with interest at 10% per annum on outstanding
balances.

INDIA
SINGRAULI THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Contract Arrangement and Tariff Proposals
1.        This annex briefly outlines the general principles that should be
followed in establishing bulk supply tariffs and makes specific recommenda-
tions as to the structure.
General Principles
2.        The discipline and example afforded by the NTPC in charging
prices that reflect incremental costs are necessary elements of a strategy
designed to improve pricing reforms at the SEB level. This has been agreed
by GOI. It was however recognized that incremental cost pricing at the bulk
level will not necessarily guarantee an optimal response at the retail level.
In particular, since the SEBs also have responsibility for generation, the
prices charged by the bulk supplier should be designed to be consistent with
the most efficient usage of generating capacity in the regional system.
Since load dispatching priorities should be determined on the basis of short
run (primarily energy) costs, the appropriate pricing arrangements for bulk
supply should be some form of a two part tariff consisting of a fixed sum
which does not vary in the short term with usage, plus a charge per unit of
use which reflects energy costs. On average, however, the price per kWh
should approximate the long run marginal cost of bulk supply, thereby impos-
ing financial pressure upon the SEBs to adjust their own tariffs accordingly.
3.        While the foregoing may allow short run efficiency to be achieved,
there remains the problem of encouraging SEBs to enter a contract to buy
from the bulk supplier which charges a price based on full economic cost
when the States themselves may make financing available at concessionary
terms. Moreover, since existing financial rate of return targets for SEBs
are based upon historic costs, the introduction of incremental cost pricing
(which by definition has to be maintained in real terms) for bulk supply may
have unpalatable pricing implications at the retail level. In view of this,
pricing according to incremental cost at the bulk level needs to be supple-
mented by administrative measures. In this respect, since SEBs are expected
to continue to invest heavily in generation and transmission, the approval
of the CEA for all projects over 50 million Rupees (covered by the recent
amendments to the Electricity Supply Act (1948)) is of critical importanep
to rational development of the sector.



ANNEX 19

Tariff Structure for Bulk Supply
4.        The following procedure outlines an appropriate pricing strategy:
(i) The NTPC and the relevant SEBs would enter a contract
under which the NTPC would undertake to meet a given de-
clared maximum demand by each SEB over a period of 25 years.
The actual tariff would be reviewed every year, at which time
a reassessment of incremental system cost of generation and
transmission by the bulk authority, and the appropriate re-
visions to the tariff schedule would be made. Within the
one year period, automatic adjustments to price would be
made as a consequence of changes in fuel costs.
(ii) Charges payable by an SEB would consist of (a) a lump sum
payment, based upon marginal capacity cost, which would,
subject to an emergency provision described in paragraph
(iii) below, entitle it to a given amount of generation
and transmission capacity during the day time period of 16
hours, plus (b) a charge per kWh actually taken, which would
be based on NTPC's short run marginal costs (i.e. primarily
fuel costs). Variations in marginal transmission costs
would be reflected in the charges payable by different
states. This arrangement would give the SEBs a financial
incentive, not only to make optimal use of generation and
transmission capacity (i.e. by basing their short run dis-
patching decisions upon true short run costs), but also to
adjust both the level and structure of their own tariffs
to reflect incremental costs.
(iii) After allowing for normal outages, 100% of NTPC's capacity
would be allocated to SEBs by contract. There would however
be a provision that in the event of emergency the CEA would
be given the right, through the NTPC, to reallocate up to
15% of supply to other SEBs whether or not those SEBs have
any contractual arrangement with NTPC. There would be a
reimbursement of marginal capacity costs to SEBs thus
deprived, such marginal capacity costs then forming part
of the kWh charge for states in emergency situations. By
definition, such states would be operating at capacity, so
even if kWh charges incorporate both marginal capacity and
operating costs, underutilization of NTPC capacity should
not result.
(iv) In the event that any surplus capacity--i.e., that in excess
of the amount contracted for--happens to be available pri-
orities should be allocated in accordance with the proportion
that each SEB contributes to marginal capacity cost. Since



ANNEX 19
Page 3 of 4 pages
the combination of "teething troubles" and relatively small
initial output may mean a need for a relatively large
sevuirity rrirgin in determining contractual arrangements,
this provision would be particularly important in early
years of NTPC's operations, becoming less significant as
the scale of operations increases.
5.        GOI agrees with the above pricing strategy but has one reservation;
rather than allocating 100% of expected available capacity to SEBs, GOI's
proposal is that 85% would be allocated, the remaining 15% being sold, in
accordance with priorities determined by CEA, to States with the greatest
need, at a price during the daytime peak equal to marginal capacity plus
energy cost, and during the night to marginal energy cost. The problem with
this is that NTPC could conceivably find itself unable to sell energy during
peak hours--even if produced by the most efficient plant--when marginal capa-
city costs are included in the rate base. The position taken by GOI is that,
in the foreseeable future there would continue to be shortages, so the capa-
city could always be utilized. This is an adequate approach for the short
term but, hopefully, the capacity shortage will in due course be alleviated
by which time it will be necessary to accept the principle that the kWh
charge should only include a capacity cost element when the SEBs themselves
are up against capacity constraints.
Long Range Pricing Problems
6.        The foregoing recommendations can be applied in a fairly straight-
forward manner as long as NTPC facilities are homogeneous and/or are appro-
priate to supply base load requirements. However the situation is likely
to become more complicated as the National 400 kV system is developed and
as NTPC begins to operate a mix of plants of varying ages and degrees of
efficiency. Although these complications will not be encountered for a
number of years after the commissioning of the Project, their implications
for organization of the sector are important enough to warrant detailed study
in the near future.
Failure of NTPC to Fulfill Contract
7.        An obvious problem is the need to decide who should bear the risk
of failure by NTPC to delivery power according to contract. The Bank's
standard public utility approach--assuming NTPC is the client in whose
financial integrity we are primarily interested--would be to let the SEBs
bear the risk. But this may not be appropriate because:
-    SEBs finances are generally poor;
-    fairness suggests that NTPC should bear the risk of its
owr. failure to adhere to the terms of the contract; and



ANNEX 19
Page 4 of 4 pages
-    a guaranteed income (based on marginal capacity costs)
might diminish the incentive to NTPC to operate efficiently.
8.        In light of the above, GOI favors NTPC or, indirectly, the central
government, suffering the financial consequences of failing to meet the con-
trac. agreement. However, physical indicators of efficiency may provide con-
siderable incentive for NTPC management, and financial incentives may equally
be diminished by the ultimate availability of central government support.
While protection of the SEBs seems to be of paramount importance, a distinc-
tion might possibly be made between "minor" outages for which the SEBs would
routinely bear the financial risk and "major" ones--such as failure to meet
a given load over a period of a month or more--which should be borne by NTPC,
with the possibility, in the last resort, of obtaining central government
subsidy.
Financial Viability
9.        Determination of the appropriate level of tariffs has to be con-
sistent with the financial viability of NTPC. If the revenues needed
for financial purposes exceed those implied by marginal cost pricing, the
tariff should be adjusted to suit financial requirements, with a structure
designed to minimize the inefficiencies involved by departure from the mar-
ginal cost criterion. Tentative estimates indicate that at 1976 prices,
the average revenue per kWh sold by NTPC will have to be about 18.5 paise
in order to provide, by the time Singrauli is in full operation, a rate of
return on net fixed assets of 9%.
1O.       The Indian power sector is characterized by shortages and under-
pricing and the bulk supply price should at a minimum be equal to the marginal
cost to NTPC of production and transmission, and possibly somewhat in excess
of this to compensate for inefficiencies at the SEB level. In order that
(a) the real economic costs of increased power consumption should be reflected
in the financial accounts of the SEBs and yet (b) optimal use be made of
NTPC's capacity, the appropriate bulk supply tariff structure should be one
in which energy charges reflect incremental resource costs to NTPC with the
fixed payment for capacity/transmission exceeding, as necessary for financial
purposes, incremental capacity/transmission costs.
