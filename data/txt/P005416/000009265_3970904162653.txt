KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
JERADA COAL MINE MODERNIZATION AND EXPANSION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:              Charbonnages du Maroc (CdM)
Guarantor:             Kingdom of Morocco
Amount:                US$27.0 million equivalent
Terms:                 Payable in 15 years, including four years of grace at
tha Bank standard variable interest rate. CdM would
pay a guarantee fee of 1.0X of the loan outstanding
to the Government.
Project Description:  The project is directed towards the modernization and
expansion of the Jerada mine from 0.8 mtpy to 1.0
mtpy by 1988 and the strengthening of CdM's
operational and planning capabilities. It would (i)
concentrate production in a single mine (ii) simplify
the infrastructure of this mine for increased
productivity and production, and (iii) improve
safety, bealth and working conditions in the mine.
It includes:
(a) a drilling program to prepare underground
development work and shaft sinking;
Cb) underground development work to prepare future
mining areas and to simplify existing mining
areas;
(c) sinking of an additional vertical shaft to
maintain the production capacity after
completion of the project and depletion of CdM's
smaller mines;
(d) installation of underground and surface
equipment to increase efficiency, production
capacity and to improve safety and health; and
(e)  technical assistance to support CdM in the
implementation of above tasks.
Project benefits:      The project would help secure and expand a
competitive indigenous coal supply in Morocco. Given
Morocco's chronic balance of payments deficits due to



-iv-
a large extent to fuel imports, the Project is
expected to have a beneficial impact in that area.
An important benefit is also the strengthening of CdM
to make it a financially viable and well managed
company.
Project risks:         The project carries geological, technical and
economic risks that are prevalent in underground thin
seam coal mining. The geological risks are of two
kinds: (i) lower minable reserves than estimated and
(ii) difficult geological conditions linked with the
shaft sinking. The exploration program is designed
to remove the uncertainty related to the geological
conditions. The technical risks relate to the
possibility of CdM not attaining the planned
production build-up. These risks are reduced because
of CdM's 3 year experience with mechanized coal
winning, the reinforcement of CdM's organization
and a technical assistance program. The economic and
financial risks relate to the long-term
competitiveness of Jerada coal vis-a-vis imported
coal and the financial viability of CdM. Closeness
to markets and the expected increase in productivity
should help CdM retain a comparative advantage in
Eastern Morocco. Also an adequate coal pricing
policy should help maintain CdM's financial viability
in the future.

I. INTRODUCTIO
1.01      The Government of Morocco and Charbonnages du Maroc (CdM) have
requested a Bank loan of about US$27.0 million to help finance the
modernization and expansion of the Jerada Coal Mine in the province of
Oujda (Map 18452). The project would seek to modernize the mine and expand
its capacity, from 800,000 tons per year (tpy) of anthracite coal, to 1
million tons by end 1988. The Project is part of the Moroccan Government
strategy to encourage and develop use of indigenous energy resources
whenever this is technically and economically viable.
1.02      The financing requirements for the project, including
contingencies and escalation are est.-gated at US$74.0 million equivalent,
of which US$49.3 million in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would
cover about 57 percent of the Project's foreign exchange cost or 38 percent
of total project cost. The Project is being co-financed with the Federal
Republic of Germany's Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW) which would
provide US$12.9 million equivalent. In addition, the French Government
agreed recently to financing for a total amount of US$7.6 million
equivalent. CdM will provide all the required local financing including
taxes and duties, and would cover from its own sources incremental working
capital.
1.03      The Project was initially submitted for Bank consideration in
September, 1981 and was prepared with the help of Belgian consultants,
Belgian Mining Engineers (BME) financed by the Bank under Loan 2114-MOR.
It was appraised in July 1984 by a mission comprising Messrs. Voltaire
(Mission leader), Hendriks and von Xlaudy, of the Industry Department.
II.  THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. 1 1/
2.01      For a number of years, Morocco has faced a severe and increasing
shortage of domestic energy resources. From 1980 to 1983 the energy
deficit as a percentage of total consumption grew from 83% to 88%. Oil
imports covered most of this deficit, and although they declined in value
during 1983 (approximately US$700 million) their average for the past four
years has been around US$1 billion per year. These imports, which have
averaged 45-50 percent of Morocco's yearly exports, have constituted a
major element of the country's balance of payments problems.
1/ The Bank carried out a survey of the Energy Sector in Morocco in
1981. For more detailed background see IBRD Report 4157-MOR

2.02      The imbalance between local energy supply and demand has
continued to widen over the past four years. Particularly worrisome is the
decreasing share of hydropower in energy production due to the severe
droughts that have affected the country recently. Because of persistently
bad climatic and hydrological conditions the realization of an ambitious
hydropower development program is seriously in doubt. In an attempt to
reduce its oil imports bill and slow the growth in energy demand, the
Government has increased petroleum product prices and has embarked on a
campaign to induce energy savings. On the supply side, priority
investments are directed towards Ci) conversion of major industrial users
of energy from oil to coal and development of coal-fired power plants in
the future, and (ii) development of feasible indigenous energy resources,
i.e., natural gas and coal.
2.03      In the field of natural gas the Bank is assisting the Government
(Loan 2271-MOR) in delineating the reserves of the Meskala gas field which,
if proven substantial, would be ar. important source of energy on the
Atlantic Coast. For coal, the proposed Jerada project would ensure a
steady and expanded supply to the existing users in the Eastern Region.
The long-term outlook on the supply side will be greatly influenced both by
the stability of the country's climatic conditions and the possibility of
developing indigenous resources like oil shale and uranium at reasonable
cost.
B. Resource Base
2.04      Coal.  Morocco's known coal reserves are located in the Jerada
coal basin in the Eastern Region, some 60 km south of Oujda. Coal reserves
at Jerada stand at 10 million tons of measured reserves and 50-60 million
tons of probable and possible reserves. Jerada coal is anthracitic and



-3-
ranges in calorific value from about 5,000 kcal/kg (run-of-mine coal) to
more than 7,000 kceal/kg (washed coal). In 1983, annual productiorn was
750,000 tons of which an estimated 650,000 tons were fed to a mine-mouth
power plaut (165 MW) operated by the Office National de l'Electricite
(ONE). In 1984, production is expected to exceed 800,000 tons. The
proposed Jerada coal project would bring annual mine production to
1,000,000 tons by 1988, through a modernization program and an extension of
mechanization. Coal occurrences have also been found in four other basins
(i.e., Tindouf, the Hauts Plateaux, Errachidia and Fquih Ben Sahal).
However, because of the estimated depth of the coal bearing strata and the
remoteness of these basins, no economic exploration campaign can be
envisaged at this time.
2.05      Hydropower and Electricity.  Morocco's total hydropower potential
is estimated at 4,600 GWH per year (1.1 million toe per year) under average
hydraulic conditions. This potential, of which about a third is capacity
already developed, is located on three main rivers, i.e., the Moulouya,
Sebou and Oum er Rbia. Because of serious droughts in the past few years.
utilization of the hydropower capacity has seriously declined.  In 1983,
while hydroelectric plants represented 37% of the total installed power
capacity of 1,650 MW, they contributed only 8% to actual electric power
generation.  The bulk of thermal power generation comes fron oil-fired
plants.  There are only two coal fired units:  the Jerada plant (165 MW)
and the Casablanca Roches-Noires plant (120 MW total of which 60 MW are
coal fired). In the future, new thermal units including the remaining
units of the Mohammedia power plant (2x150 MW, total capacity 600 NW) will
be coal-fired. The development of the remaining hydropower potentii-L
hinges on the following set of constraints: (i) a predicated improvement
of the climatic and hydrological conditions, (1i) a close examination of
the economics of the multipurpose dams (see IBRD Report No. 4135-MOR,
"Morocco Power Subsector Study") and (iii) a full assessment of the natural
gas reserves at Meskala. These questions are being actively discussed by
the Bank and the Government in the context of the Bank involvement in both
the power and oil and gas subsectors.
2.06      Hydrocarbons.  Production of oil from the Gharb and Essaouira
basins which peaked at 2,300 bbls/d in 1963, was a modest 350 bbls/d in
1981 (19,000 toe/yr). In addition, some 3 billion cubic feet per year
(60,000 toe/yr) of natural gas have been produced from these basins since
1975. In 1981, as part of an exploration project financed by the Bank
(Loan S-18-MOR), gas was discovered in deeper horizons of the Essaouira
Basin. A follow-up Bank project approved in April 1983 (Loan 2271-MOR)
aims at assessing reserves and the production potential of the discovery.
Although the full extent and recoverability of these reserves will not be
known until early 1985, preliminary results have not matched earlier
expectations so far.
2.07      Oil Shale.  Estimated oil shale reserves are about 100 billion
tons, containing more than 6 billion tons of oil. The most favorable
deposit is at Timahdit and contains some 3.3 billion tons of oil shale with
an average oil content of 65 liters/con of shale. A program to assess the
technical and economic viability of a commercial exploitation of the
Timahdit deposit is presently being undertaken with the assistance of the



-4-
Bank (Loan 2114-MOR) but prospects for commercial development of this
energy source appear unfavorable.
2.08      Uranium and Other Energy Resources.  It is estimated that 60 to
80 billion toe of uranium are contained in Morocco's large phosphate
reserves. Uranium extraction for power generation in nuclear plants is,
however, not economic at present and is not likely to be developed before
the 1990s. Solar and wind resources are relatively abundant, but neither
Is likely to contribute significantly to the country's energy balance.
C.   hr!   Coronpmton
2.09      Per capita energy consumption in Morocco is relatively low
compared to other countries of similar economic characteristics. In 1981,
Morocco's energy consumption per capita was estimated at about 0.28 toe
compared to 0.45 for Egypt, 0.57 for Turkey and 0.50 for Tunlsia.
2.10      In 1981, industry accounted for about 42% of final demand for
comnercial energy. Of total industrial consumption of nearly 1.8 million
toe, about 212 was attrlbutable to the phosphate and 24Z to the cement
industries. The transportation and services sector accounted for an almost
equal share (or 39Z) of commercial energy demand and agriculture for 4%.
Overall, households are the most Important energy consumlng sector;
household consumption is, however, primarily reliant on traditional energy
sources and constitutes no more than 15% of coamercial energy demand.
2.11      During 1983, substitution of coal for oil led to a trlpling of
the imported coal tonnage in Morocco. From a level of about 64,000 tons in
1982, coal imports reached 282,000 tons ln 1983 with the increase primarily
due to the conversion of the second 60 MW unit of the Roches-Noires power
plant at Casablanca from fuel to coal and the conversion to coal of two
cement plants in Casablanca and Meknes.   Approximately one million tons of
coal was consumed in 1983.
2.12      Past and Future Trends.  Over the 1965-80 period. Morocco's
commercial energy demand grew at about 7.4% p.a. on average. This compares
with an average annual GDP growth rate of about 5X. The overall growth
rate actually slowed somewhat through the period, so that by 1975-80 energy
demand growth (of 6.5% p.a. on average) was within 1% p.a. of the (5.6%
average annual) GDP growth rate. There was also some shifting of market
shares among the three broad groups of commercial energy commodities;
electricity; clean liquid fuels (CLF) and boiler fuels, / as indicated in
the following table:
2/ Boiler fuels include coal, natural gas and fuel oil.

2.13      Overall, demand for commercial energy is expected to grow from
4.7 million toe in 1980 to between 8.6 million toe and 13.1 million toe in
1995.3/ As also indicated in the table, projections for the period

consumption in 1980, r^ 40% in 1995.

2.14      Past Pattern and Potential Future Options.  The growth in energy
consumption over the 1965-83 period was coupled to a pattern of energy
supplies characterized chiefly by three main trends: (i) a declining share
of hydropower (from 872 of total electricity supply in 1965 to 8% in 1983);
(Li) a parallel decline in the share of coal (from about 28% of total
boiler fuel supply in 1965 to 11.5% in 1983); and (iii) a marked shift in
favor of oil products, the share of which in total commercial demand rose
from about 71% in 1965 to about 85% in 1983, with the major proportion of
this increase being accounted for by an increase in supply of fuel oil. In
1970, total demand for fuel oil (direct plus indirect via thermal power
plants) represented 33Z of the oil market, a fraction which rose to 45% in
1982. Meanwhile, the share of fuel oil in refinery production (excluding
non-energy products) rose from 30% in 1970 to 43% in 1983.
2.15      If the present dependence on oil continues, crude oil imports
could rise from 4.2 million toe in 1983 to as much as 11.3 million toe in
1995, entailing an increase in the oil import bill from about $1.0 billion
in 1981 to nearly $3.3 billion in 1995 (in 1983 dollars). On the demand
side, the large proportion of Morocco's energy consumption that is not
accounted for by fuel oil directly or indirectly offers a variety of
3/ Real GDP growth is projected at 3.1% p.a. on average in the 1980-85
period and 5.0% p.a. thereafter. Overall demand for commercial energy
is projected to grow at the same rate (low forecast) or at 32 p.a.
higher (high forecast). Consumption of traditional fuels is projected
to decline very slowly (from 2.59 million toe in 1985 to 2.46 million
toe in 1995) as consumers switch to commercial fuels (primarily LPG) at
a rate that compensates for population growth.

opportunities for inter-fuel substituion and conservation; and on thbe
supply side, local and imported coal, natural gas and condensates from the
Essaouira area, and possibly oil shale could be available to displace
imported oil.
2.16      Imported Coal.  New thermal power stations and the cement and
phosphate industries would represent the most likely major markets for
coal.  Together they are projected to provide (in the case of high demand
and no gas supplies) a potential coal market of about 1.6 million toe in
1990 and 4.0 million toe in 1995. At this level of demand, switching to
coal could hold the oil import bill to less than US$1.7 billion in 1990 (in
1983 dollars). Holding demand growth at the same time to lower levels
would reduce the import bill for that year to US$1.3 billion (1983
dollars).
2.17      Natural Gas.  Natural gas and condensates from Essaouira
represent the most immediately promising source for alleviating the need
for imports of either oil or coal. At present, 37Z of the smalI quantities
of natural gas produced annually is consumed in industries, 47% in the
phosphate, and 16X in the pulp and paper industries. However, 'new'
natural gas, if it were to be available in sufficient quantities, could
supply nearly 60% of the total direct demand for boiler fuels and between
47% and 75% of demand in electricity generation. Depending on the growth
rate of overall commercial energy demand, the projected market for gas
would total between 1.9 and 2.9 million toe in 1990 and between 3.0 and 5.4
million toe in 1995. A preliminary market study is on-going under the
current petroleum exploration project to further assess this gas market and
rank possible uses for both the gas and condensates. It is presently
estimated that if by 1990 gas from Essaouira were available in sufficient
quantities to meet market demand, the oil import bill would be held to
about US$1.1 billion (1983 dollars).
E. Sector Organization
2.18      Sectoral planning, coordination Paxd policy making is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Energy and Mires (MEM). The MEM, created
in 1977, has three operating directorates: the Directorate of Energy, the
Directorate of Mines, and the Directorate of Geology. In addition to its
planning and policy-making role, ME! supervises most of the public
enterprises in charge of managing the different erergy subsectors, in
particular: the Office National de Recherches et d'Exploitations
Petrolieres (ONAREP) for hydrocarbon and oil shale exploration and
development; Charbonnages du Maroc (CdM) for coal exploration and
development; the Office National de l'Electricite (ONE), for electricity
generation; a petroleum products agency (SNPP), and two petroleum
refineries (SAMIR and SCP). MEM is also involved in the development of
renewable energy and has recently established the Centre pour le
Developpement des Energies Renouvelables (CDER) in Marrakech.
2.19      In the coal subsector, CdM is the single coal production
institution and is also directly in charge of coal exploration and export
marketing. A CdM subsidiary, SOCOCHARBO, is the only coal marketing



-7-
company within Morocco and also presently the sole importer of coal in the
country. In the power sector, ONE generates approximately 90% of the
electric power in the country, transmits it to the load centers, and
distributes about 40% of its productior outside the large cities.
Distribution of power in large urban areas is the responsibility of Regies
which are autonomous public enterprises under the supervision of the
Ministrv of the Interior.
F.  Emergy Pricing and Conservation
2.20      Pricing.  During the past three years the Government has
undertaken a serious effort in the pricing of energy both to encourage
conservation and the development of indigenous resources. In practice this
has meant higher prices than their opportuDity costs for oil products
and adjustments close to import parity levels for domestic coal. Prices of
domestic anthracite fines (5,200 kcallkg) increased almost fourfold in
three years, i.e., from DH 128/ton in 1981 to DR 464/ton in 1984.  The
Government has also removed most of the taxes and duties on imported coal
(1982-83) to stimulate switching from imported oil to imported coal.
2.21      Electricity tariffs, however, remain far below their economic
cost. These tariffs need to be generally increased and their structure
rationalized, both to facilitate the financing of power investments, and to
stimulate more efficient use of electrical energy. The Bank is pursuing an
active dialogue with ONE and the Government on this issue. The Government
is presently reviewing the gas pricing issue, with the intention of setting
an appropriate price for all 'new' domestic gas supplies. The uncertainty
as to the volume of future supplies from Meskala complicates the
determination of such a policy, as the utilization options and related
opportunity costs for gas are partly a function of the volume of supply.
Nevertheless, the Moroccan fuel oil market is large, and much of it could
be switched to gas. For the time being, a gas price linked to that of fuel
oil (with enough of a discount to justify conversion and rapid market
penetration) would therefore be appropriate until reserves are found to be
sufficiently large that it appears advantageous to encourage lower value
uses. This issue is also being addressed by the Bank within the cor-ext of
the petroleum project (Loan 2271-MOR).
2.22      Energy Conservation.  In the area of energy conservation the
Government undertook in July 1983 a major study on energy conservation in
industry. The study has already provided an extensive data base for the
industrial sector in the area of energy conservation and as a first policy
measure, the Government is now providing monetary incentives to an amount
of DH 500 for each toe conserved (equipment credits). The Bank has
estimated that conservation measures in the industrial sector could save
the Moroccan economy some 80,000 toe per annum at a cost of about US$40
million. It is expected that most of these measures will be implemented
following completion of the study.



-8-
G. Governenlt SStrategy
2.23      The Government has three main policy objectives in the energy
sector: (i) to encourage fuel import substitution leading to foreign
exchange savings, (ii) to promote efficient energy use and (iii) to
mobilize and increaee domestic resources.  The ambitious five-year
development plan (1981-85) was prepared along these lines. The
increasing financial strains of the past years have slowed down
considerably the pace of investments in the sector. Nevertheless some
priority investments, i.e., in oil and gas and fuel switching are underway
and should contribute to ease the country's balance of payments problems.
These financial constraints make it more urgent to (i) reinforce the
process of selection and coordination of energy and energy-related
investments and the management and organization of public sector
enterprises; and (ii) improve the present energy pricing structure. In
particular, both for ONE and ONAREP opportunity cost pricing for
electricity and gas should be adopted if resource allocation is to be
efficient. For coal, although the present pricing is considered adequate,
a Government commitment to maintain internal coal prices close to import
parity levels is essential for CdM's viability. During negotiations the
principal objectives of the Government's future energy policy were
discussed and found to be satisfactory. The dialogue between the Bank and
the Government on implementation of this strategy could be pursued in the
course of the preparation of future energy related projects.
III. THE COAL MARKET IN WROCCO
A.  Local Production and Markets
3.01      jerada coal has in the past been primarily marketed in Morocco.
The main reasons are that (a) because of the coal's friable nature most of
Jerada's coal producticn consists of fines (80%) which, although being
anthracitic, cannot be sold on the international anthracite markets which
require a very high quality product; and (b) the Jerada power plant was
built in that location with the prime objective of consumption of Jerada
coal and is capable of absorbing large quantities (up to 700,000 tons) if
running at full capacity. The following table gives a summary of Jerada
production, domestic sales and export sales, with differences between sales
and production due mainly to inventory carryover.

Export sales have fluctuated between 18,000 tons in 1975 and 90,000 tons in
1980 (representing 2% and 13% of sales respectively) due to various factors
including variations in exportable quantities, and pace of sales on local
markets. CdM's principal export markets have been France and the U.K. but
small quantities have also been sold to other European countries.
3.02      On the domestic market the principal client for Jerada coal has
been ONE, which purchased mainly for the Jerada power plant (between
480,000 and 690,000 tons), but smaller quantities (13,000 to 32,000 tons)
have been shipped to the Oujda power plant (now out of service) and most
recently to Casablanca. A second group of important customers are the
sugar plants which have taken between 17,000 and 43,000 tons per year since
1974. Household consumption of high quality anthracite ranged between
25,000 and 30,000 tons per year. Other clients purchasing smaller
quantities have been smelters, and other mining companies. CdM itself has
consumed between 5,000 and 10,000 tons yearly. SOCOCHARBO, a CdM
subsidiary based in Casablanca, is responsible for marketing of CdM coal
which is not directly delivered to the Jerada power plant or exported. The
main function of the company has been in the past to serve the needs of
home heating, sugar factories and smelters. However, on-going conversions
of power plants and cement plants to coal have diversified the company's
clients and have resulted in a dominating, quasi-monopolistic role of
SOCOCHARBO in coal imports which have to cover the gap between actual
consumption of coal needs and the Jerada production.
B.   Coal Imports
3.03      Through 1981 coal imports were relatively stable and consisted to
a large extent of coking coal for sugar plants and smelters.

In view of the substantial cost differentials between energy produced from
coal and oil, however, ONE and other consumers (cement plants) in Morocco
took the decision to convert their plants from oil to coal. These
decisions started to have a major impact in 1983 when 280,000 tons of coal
were imported, of which about 150,000 by ONE and more than 50,000 for
cement plants. Currently ONE operates one 60 NW unit of its Roches Noires
plant at Casablanca with coal, with an annual consumption between 150,000
and 200,000 tons of coal. In addition ONE will start operating the
extension of its Mohammedia power plant with coal in 1985. The cement
plants Lafarge in Casablanca and Cadem in Meknes started to operate with
coal in 1983, and the Cimenterie de l'Oriental (CIOR) cement plant near
Oujda will start to operate with coal in 1985. Other cement plants
(Agadir, Tangiers, and Tetouan) are also planning to convert to coal use.
In view of the conversions under way or planned, and abstracting from the
proposed expansion of coal production at Jerada, coal imports would
increase substantially between 1984 and 1986. The following table
summarizes these forecasts by category of users.

C.  Pcig
3.04      Coal prices in Morocco are set by an interministerial commission
where the Ministry of Economic Affairs and MEM play a significant role.
For the past 4 years, these prices have been reviewed annually and adjusted
on an ad hoc basis. Domestic Free on Rail prices for Jerada Coal in 1984
stood at DH 464lt (US$54.0/t) for fines sold to ONE (80% of total
production) and an average of DH 670/t (US$77.0/t) for good quality
anthracite. Export prices averaged DH 900ft (US$100/t) FOB Moroccan port.
In 1984, prices for Imported steam coal in Morocco for power generation and
cement factories (quality equivalent to Jerada) have averaged US$40-45/ton
CIF Casablanca and US$60-65/ton FOR Casablanca with demurrage, handling and
other fees in the order of US$7/ton and taxes in the order of US$13/ton.
Internal transport costs were about USf2.3/t km for rail transport and
US$10/ton for truck transport between the Port of Nador and Oujda where
there is no railway link. The table below shows 1984 Jerada Coal price
competitiveness with imported coal for CdM's largest customer, ONE Jerada,
and its future major customer CIOR. For comparison, also a coal-fired
power plant on the West Coast is included.

c/ Because of the special design of the Jerada power plant boilers
only anthracite fines can be burned, which account for the higher
CIF price.
3.05      The situation depicted in the table above will in all likelihood
continue to prevail during the end of the 1980s and beginning 1990s.



-12-
Although a new, imported coal based plant on the West Coast would have
lower fuel costs than the existing Jerada plant (US$52/t compared to
US$54/t), the high capital costs involved to replace the Jerada plant
(US$1.2 million per MW installed) and the foreign exchange outlays in fuel
costs make this an unattractive proposition, given the sunk investment
already in place at Jerada and a remaining useful life of at least 15
years.
3.06      While the present pricing structure does not fully reflect the
opportunity cost of Jerada Coal it represents a considerable improvement
over past pricing policies (para. 4.26). With an average realized price of
DH 500/t (US$58.0/t) in 1984, CdM is easily able to cover unit production
costs of DH 442/t (US$51/t) (para. 7.03). To preserve CdM's viability in
the future and also maintain access of consumers to competitively priced
coal, the Government would ensure that the selling price for Jerada coal
(FOR Hassi Blal railhead) is at least equal to 85% (but not more than 100%)
of the opportunity cost of such coal. This opportunity cost would be
derived from the average CIF price of imported steam coal (adjusted to the
heating value of Jerada fines) during the previous calendar year, plus port
and handling fees, and estimated transport costs to Jerada. The price for
fines (80% of production) would then be set in the range of 85-100% of the
calculated opportunity costs, thus allowing for some flexibility, in order
to set prices competitively for CIOR and to take into account the
unfavorable location of the Jerada power plant. On the basis of the above
formula the Government would review selling prices for Jerada fines once a
year upon CdM's proposal and consult with the Bank before November 30 of
each year on their level. The Government would then adjust the selling
price not later than December 31 of that year to meet the above
requirements. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
This procedure would not only assure CdMIs financial health but also
provide for protection against foreign exchange risks of loan repayment
because of the link of revenues to international coal prices.
D.  Jerada's Future Coal Markets
3.07      The table below presents a likely distribution of Jerada's future
production. ONE's Jerada power plant is currently under partial overhaul
and should be fully operational again by 1985. It would then be capable of
absorbing about 700,000 tons of coal (fines) per year. To ensure a
continuous outlet for Jerada fines, CdM has entered into a long-term coal
supply agreement with ONE which was discussed during negotiations and is
considered satisfactory. The CIOR cement factory, which is close to the
Jerada mine and linked to it by a rail connection, will consume about
150,000 tons per year by 1986. In October 1984, CIOR's management in a
letter to CdM clearly stated its intention to purchase this amount from
Jerada provided that prices do not exceed prices of equivalent imported
coal. Appropriate long-term arrangements between CdM and CIOR are expected
to be concluded once CdM's production is sufficient to supply the cement
pLant. Sales to the sugar factories are likely to range around the same
level as in the past and can be estimated at 40,000 tons per year.
Household consumption, CdM's own consumption and other clients can be
expected to absorb another 40,000 tons while the export market is estimated
at 70,000 tons.

4.01      The digcovery of the Jerada coal deposit dates back to 1908
although systematic exploration did not take place until 1927. The first
company to exploit the deposit was created in 1929 with participation of
Bureau de Recherches et de Participations Minieres (BRPH), the French
Government, French and Belgian commercial interests and a few individual
shareholders. In 1946 this company was named Charbonnages Nord-Africains
(CNA). In 1957 the Moroccan Government took over the part of shares held
by the French Government to increase the BRPM share in CNA to 48%, and
subsequently to 54% (1964) and 99Z (1972) througb purchase of the shares of
the other shareholders. A further change was introduced in 1981 when CNA
became Charbonnages du Maroc (CdM).  Even though CdM has remained a stock
corporation (societe anonyme), it operates as a public enterprise and is
subject to financial controls similar to those applicable to public
enterprises. The Board of Directors consists of 14 representatives of
public institutions including BRPM, the Ministries of Finance, Energy and
Mines, Planning, and Equipment, and the Governor of the Province of Oujda.
4.02      Production started in 1932 with 15,000 tons of anthracite and
increased gradually to a level of about 200,000 tons around 1940. After
intervention of the Government and implementation of a rehabilitation plan,
production continued to grow and reached 360,000 tons in 1952. In the
early 1970s a further rehabilitation program was implemented which included
as essential elements substantial increases of wages and salaries, a review
of the wage and incentive structure, and introduction of Improvements in
underground working conditions and leading to an increase in production of
400,000 tons in 1970 to 700,000 tons in 1977.
4.03      Subsequently production stagnated, fluctuating around 700,000
tons until 1981. While productivity remained around 1,050 kg/manshift
until 1979 it declined thereafter to the present level of 800 kg/manshift
due mainly to increased mining in deeper and more difficult areas of the
deposit without adequate planning and investments. During the same period
the Government adjusted domestic coal prices at a pace slower than that of
prices of imported fuels with the main purpose of protecting consumers of
electricity. Declining productivity and inadequate price adjustments



-14-
resulted in operational losses after 1979 and in debts accumulating to
about DH 150 million. A new dynamic management team has been trying since
1980 to reverse the declining trend through increased efforts to achieve
improvements in working conditions, mechanization trials and organizational
measures aimed at increasing efficiency undetground.
4.04      In addition to its importance for local electricity production,
the Jerada mine plays an important role in the local economy of the border
province of Oujda. It is the largest employer in this province with a
workforce of about 6,500. The town of Jerada depends entirely on mining
activities and has about 50,000 inhabitants, many of them family members of
miners but frequently engaged in other activities such as trading or
handicrafts. CdM operates a training center which, because of high
personnel fluctuation, also has considerable effects outside CdM. Further
activities promoted or directly run by CdM in Jerada are medical services,
provision of housing for staff and workers, artisanal and cultural
activities and garment making.
B.   The Jerada Coal Deposit
4.05      The Jerada coal deposit, together with the Algerian Kemadza
deposit, is the only source of coal production in North Africa. The
deposit is located about 60 km southwest of Oujda in a hilly, semi-arid
area with an average altitude of about 1,000 m (Map 18452RI).
4.06      The most reliable and valuable information about the structure of
the deposit derives from the existence of a multitude of galleries and
inclines driven during the past 50 years of exploitation in the eastern
section of the basin. Additional knowledge of the deposit is available
from shallow and deep drillholes and extensive surface mapping, again
concentrated mainly in the eastern portion of the basin. Whereas the
eastern section is well explored, the extension of the western portion of
the deposit is only known from 10 deep drillholes of which 5 intersected
the basin's coal-bearing strata. However, the good knowledge of the
easterm section allows a relatively reliable interpretation of the general
structure of the total deposit.
4.07      The coal basin has an extension of about 22 km in east-west
direction and a width of about 4 km in north-south direction. The a-;ea
cov3red is about 60 km2. In the eastern portion, over an area of about
17 km2 the coal seams bearing strata (of carboniferous geological age) are
outcropping to the surface. In the western portion, over an area of about
43 km2, they are overlain by younger rocks of liassic and triassic age.
The deepest poi:'. of the basin (depth of lowest minable seam) in the
uncovered eastern portion of the coalfield is about 500 m below the surface
and in the covered western portion about 1,000 m below the surface or 400 m
below the secondary rock overlying the coal-bearing strata.
4.08      The coal seams are heavily folded and faulted.  Folding is
particularly pronounced in the southern half of the basin where, in
general, three synclines occur, with the majority of coal reserves in
steeply (60-90°) inclined flanks of the synclines. Folding is less



-15-
pronounced in the central and northern portions of the coal basin, where
seams are mostly inclined at an angle of about 300. Some major faults run
across the coal basin mainly from aorth to south. In the eastern portion
of the basin, major faults have led to the delineation of two smaller
coalfields (Bassin Nord and Secteur Est) apart from the main coal basin.
4.09      The coal basin contains four minable coal seams which are
indexed, from the bottom upwards, as seams A, B, C and F (Map IBRD 18453).
The thickness of these seams varies in general between 0.5 and 0.9 m. Only
occasionally does thickness reach 1 m. There are a number of other seams
which are too thin for mining. The perpendicular distance between the
seams A, B and C is about 25 m and between seam C and F 140 m. The minable
seams are regular in thickness and there are little rock inclusions in the
coal. Hangingwall and footwall consist of shale. Rock pressure can be
considered normal and is comparable to many West European coal mines.
Possibilities for mechanized mining are restricted due to the low seam
thickness, inclination of the seams, and occasional inclusions of
sedimentary rock or basaltic dykes in the coal.
4.10      Total exploitable reserves of the Jerada coal basin are expected
to be in the order of 50 million tons. A more reliable estimate of coal
reserves, however, is only available for the better explored eastern
portion of the basin (east of longitudinal 791,800, about 20 km2 or one
third of the coal basin surface). Here coal reserves as of mid-1984 are as
follows:

a/  Since seams F and C have been found to be too thin
in some areas of the existing dine for mining or
with excessive rock inclusions, their reserves
are only accounted to 50%.
Source: CdM and BME, 1984.
About 35% of these reserves occur in seam sections with steep (more than
300) inclination and 65% in seam sections with moderate (less than 30°)
inclination.
4.11      The coal, in situ, is of good anthracitic quality with high
heating value, low volatile content and low levels of ash and sulfur. The
table below lists average values for these properties.

The coal is friable and breaks down into fine particles when mined. Due to
the thinness of the seams, a relatively high amount of rock is contained in
the run-of-mine production, which is easily separated from the coal by
washing.
C. Underground Mines
4.12      The Jerada deposit is presently being mined by three small
underground mines which are not interconnected: the Bassin Nord mine, the
Siege IV mine, located in the Secteur Est, and the Siege V mine, located in
the southeast of the main basin (see Map 18453). Some key data on these
mines are presented in the table below:

Siege V is the newest mine, and, situated in the main coal basin, will
become in the near future the only supplier of coal after depletion of the
two smaller basins. Bassin Nord reserves will be depleted as soon as 1986
and Secteur Est reserves (Siege IV mine) in 1992. Productivity of the
Siege V mine is lower due to a more complex network of galleries which has
its origin in insufficient and inconsistent mine planning (para. 4.14).
Preparation of the Siege V mine for increased production and improved
productivity with a simultaneous simplification of its underground network
of galleries is the main objective of the proposed project (para. 5.05).



-17-
4.13      All mines employ the longwall minlng technique.  There are only 2
semi-mechanized longwall faces (equipped with coal plough, armored conveyor
and individual hydraulic props for roof sutoort) operating ln Slege V.  In
1983, they accounted for less than 1OZ of CdM's production. All other
faces (on average 25 in operation in 1983) are non-mechanized; S8Z are
found in seam sections inclined less than 30' and 42X in seam sections
inclined more than 30°. The average face length is 110 m and the average
daily advance 1.2 m. The coal is transported from the face with conveyors
through a network of galleries and inclined shafts to the surface. The
average underground transport distance is about 3 km. Waste rock mined
with the coal seams and the galleries advanced in rock, is added to the
conveyors. The average run-of-mine coal thus has a waste ballast content
of about 40Z.
4.14      Galleries and shafts have been driven mainly when needed co
secure production for the immediate future due to both, lack of
sufficiently farsighted and consistent mine planning and lack of
financing. In particular in the Siege V mine, this has resulted in an
overly complicated underground network of galleries and inclines, making
transportation and ventilation more difficult which in turn reduces
significantly the productivity of underground labor and increases safety
and health hazards. Investments to simplify the network and to install
efficient transportation and ventilation equipment are needed.
Furthermore, insufficient preparations have been made in the main basin
(Siege V mine) to accommodate additional productlon capacity needed to
replace production from the depleting Bassin Nord and Siege IV mines. Some
main galleries and a new shaft have to be constructed for this purpose.
D.   Surface Tnotallatjons
4.15      A central washing plant is located at the exit of the inclined
shaft of Siege V. It receives coal from the Bassin Nord and Siege IV mines
by trucks and railway cars over a distance of 2 km and 7 km, respectively.
The plant consists of crushers, screens and jigs for coarse and
intermediate size coal. It employs 220 people and has a capacity of at
least 1.0 million tons of product. A simplified flowsheet and mass balance
is presented in Figure 1 below;

The washed coal has an average heating value of about 7,500 kcal/kg and an
ash content of 5-10. It is produced Ln 4 size classes ranging from 6 to
80 m. It represents 20X by weight of the total saleable product. The
unwashed fine coal (0-6 mm) has an average heating value of about 4,800
kcal/kg, an ash content of 301 and represents about 80% by weight of the
total saleable product. Leaving the washing plant, the fine coal is
transported directly by conveyor over a distance of 0.6 km to ONE's power
plant.
4.16      Operation of the washing plant is well established and largely
problem-free. Plant outlay and most equipment is appropriate for a 20-30%
increase of throughput. Relatively minor investments will be required to
ensure that with an increased amount of waste rock from gallery headings
and mechanized coal faces the ash content of the fine coal for the power
plant will not exceed 30%, as required by boiler design. In addition, a
new waste shale dump will have to be started as the old dump is being
filled up.
4.17      The ONE power plant consists of 3 units of 55 MW each.  It was
constructed in the mid-1960s under a contract with the USSR. The plant
supplies base load power and is interconnected with the national grid.
Yearly supply of electricity is about 1,100 GWh, equivalent to a coal
consumption of about 650,000 t/year. There is a coal storage capacity at
the power station of 50,000 tons.

4.18      CdM's head office is located at Rabat.  It is the seat of the
company's chief executive (Administrateur Delegue) as well as of the sales,
purchasing, and administration and finance departments, which would operate
less effetively from Jerads. The Rabat office also maintains close liaison
with the different ministries. All operations at Jerada are directed by
the General Manager, whose office is at Jerada. The General Manager
controls about 30 departments and services at Jerada (the most important
ones are shown in Annex4-1). Presently, many of the services report
directly to the General Manager. There is no interference from the Rabat
office with the operations at Jerada.
4.19      CdM's total staff at the end of 1983 numbered about 6,500, out of
which about 6,420 are employed at Jerada and 80 at Rabat. The table below

4.20      CdH in the past suf ered from a high turnover among its managers
mainly because of the remote location of Jerada, the limited housing
available as well as poor career development prospects. In particular at
Jerada, management changes made it difficult to establish a consistent long
term nine development program whereas execution of the daily production
task due to the long experience of the more stable lower production
management, did not represent serious problems. Since 1981 however, the
situation has improved substantially with increases in salaries and
provision of new housing facilities.
4.21      In order to carry out the project effectively, CdH proposed a
revised organization chart and staffing which were discussed during
negotiations and found satisfactory by the Bank. The proposed changes were
subsequently implemented and, starting in February 1985, only four main
line managers will directly report to the General Manager, each of them
with clearly defined responsibilities. The line managers are: Technical
(surface installations), Production, Planning and Administrative. The
Production, Technical and Administrative Managers have already been
appointed while a technical assistant, recruited under the technical
assistance contract with BME will assist the General Manager in the tasks
related to planning until a Planning Manager has been trained and
appointed. In order to assure effective Project implementation, CdM has
created the post of Project Coordinator and has appointed a qualified staff
to that post, directly reporting to the General Manager.



-20-
4.22      CdW's Jerada operations traditionally have also suffered from a
high turnover rate (20-25%) among workers, largely due to dependence on
migrant labor. Although this pattern will likely persist in future, the
level is expected to be reduced due to CdM's efforts to provide more and
better housing. CdM maintains training programs for unskilled and skilled
labor up to the foreman level and has no difficulty in recruiting a
sufficient number of experienced key workers and lower level supervisors.
One area however, where recruitment has been difficult, in particular at
the engineer's level, is the electric and mechanical services. CdlM has
recognized this and in addition to a special housing program for engineers,
intends to improve working conditions through the above mentioned
organizational changes and reinforcement of these services.
F.   Accounting, Auditing Practices and Financial Reporting
4.23      CdM's AdAmnistrative and Finance Department, headed by a
department director, comprises the following four divisions (i) the
Accounting Divicion in charge of general and cost accounting; (ii) the
Information Systems Division responsible for all data processing related to
financial matters; (iii) the Financial Analysis Division which establishes
annual budgets of operations and investments; and (iv) the Adu-inistrative
Division which deals with personnel matters and compensation.
4.24      CdM is subject to financial control by the Ministry of Finance.
A financial controller is assigned to the company and has to approve all
purchases exceeding DR 50,000 (US$5,300). In addition, the financial
controller is entitled to verify accounting information at all times and to
ask for financial data not contained in regular reports.  CdH's accounting
system is well organized and provides up-to-date accounting information.
4.25      CdM's accounts are aow audited by the Ministry of Fiuance.  CdM
would be required in the future to use independent external auditors
acceptable to the Bank. CdM would provide to the Bank no later than six
months after close of its fiscal year audited financial statements for that
year. However, submission of the first audited financial statements would
be due July 31, 1985 for CdM FY 1984. Assurances to this effect were
obtained at negotiations.
G. Production Costs
4.26      Between 1974 and 1979 domestic prices were sufficient to cover
CdWMs production costs and provide for an additional positive margin.
After 1979 however, coal prices were adjusted by rates lower than those of
production cost increases, which resulted in negative margins between set
prices and unit costs. These margins have been the principal reason for
operational losses between 1980 and 1983. A drastic change in the
Government's price setting policy entailed a series of coal price increases
in 1983 and early 1984 which brought their level close to that of import
parity prices of stean coal giving CdM a profit margin of 13%. Given the
current levels of prices and of production costs, a positive margin can be
expected in 1984. The table below summarizes the development of average
sale prices and CdM unit costs on a yearly basis:

4.27      The most important item in the unit costs are wages and salaries
which have accounted for between 40% and 5OZ5/ of the total over the last
few years. The second most important item is consumables accounting for
10-15% while administrative charges have averaged 8Z, health costs
(silicosis) 4%, and depreciation charges which increased over the period
from 6% to 18% due to previous investments for opening of new mine areas
and for equipment. The substantial increases in unit cost during 1979,
1980, 1981 are explained by (i) a series of salary increases for mine
workers (15-20% per year) as a result of collective bargaining agreements
and (ii) a substantial increase in depreciation due to capitalization of a
large number of galleries underground.
4.28      CdM's unit production cost of DH 442/t (US$511t) in 1984 for coal
with an average heating value of 5,500 kcal/kg is high relative to unit
cost for large steam coal mines in the U.S., Australia or South Africa
where unit costs are US$20-40/t and heating values 6,000-6,500 kcal/kg.
However, Jerada's costs compare well with international anthracite
producers which range from about US$25/t (China) to US$l00Jt (Western
Europe) for anthracite of the samp heating value. CdM's future production
costs are discussed in para. 7.03. The competitiveness of Jerada coal in
the Moroccan coal market has been discussed in paras. 3.04-3.06.
H.   Past and Present Financial Performance
4.29      CdM's historical financial statements are presented in Annex
4-2.  The following table summarizes CdM's past financial performance.

4.30      As discussed above, the low level of coal prices during the past
4 years has bad a detrimental impact on CdM's finances. The Company has
suffered serious operational losses during these years and has had to
default on amounts due to the social security system (CNSS) and other banks
to continue its operations. As a result of Governmaent decisions in 1983
these short-term debts have now been consolidated and rescheduled (para.
4.31). The Moroccan fiscal regime does not allow companies to carry over
losses for more than 5 years, but permits deferral of all or part of their
yearly depreciation. CdM used this feature during 1982 and 1983 and
deferred some DH 88.2 million in depreciation. The liquidity position of
the Company (because of the debt rescheduling) has improved notably with a
current ratio increasing from 0.5 in 1982 to 1.7 in 1983. For 1984, the
latest coal prices increases have had a positive effect on CdM's finances
with a forecast income of DH 10 million for the year and a relatively
strong liquidity position, i.e., a current ratio of 1.8.
I.   Debt and Financial Restructuring
4.31      Over the last three years, CdM in order to avoid bankrupey
reduced the amount of investments for rehabilitation and modernization of
the Jerada mine and did not pay amounts due to the social security system
(CNSS) and to credit institutions for repayments of due debts. While CdM
continued servicing its suppliers' credits, it started negotiations with
CNSS, Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG) and Banque Nationale de



-23-
Developpement (BNDE) on rescheduling the remaining debt (about DH 170
million in 1983). Despite government subsidies and improving financial
prospects due to higher coal prices it was clear that the amounts due could
not be repayed from the 1984 cash flow if operations were to continue
normally and necessary investments were to be carried out. In November
1983, CdM reached an agreement with CNSS (concerning about DH 100 million)
on rescheduling of the total amount due over 20 years without interest but
indexed to the price of Jerada coal. Negotiations with the Government, CCG
and BNDE concerning some DH 70 million were concluded in January 1985. The
solution adopted involves the repayment of CdM debts due to CCG (about DR
25 million) by the Government out of 1984 budget allocations for CdK,
rescheduling of debts to BNDE, amounting to about DH45 million, over 20
years, and payment by CCG of outstanding interest on this debt amounting to
about DH 10 million.
4.32      The solution adopted by the Government for financial
restructuring of CdM was discussed during negotiations and found
satisfactory by the Bank.
V. 7HE PRJECT
A.   Project Origin and Preparation
5.01      The project concept was first presented to a Bank mission in
September 1981.  At that time it was concluded that Bank involvement was
premature for the following reasons:
(i)  the development strategy presented *-as too ambitious, proposing
an expansion to 2.0 mtpy in a 5-6 year period;
-i)  proposed underground mechanization was still untested at Jerada;
and
(iii)  a major financial restructuring of CdM as well as an adequate
coal pricing policy were needed.
5.02      During the past 3 years, the Bank was instrumental In persuading
the Government to establish appropriate coal prices, reschedule CdM's debts
and helping CdM define a reasonable rehabilitation and expansion program.
After the first trial longwall face had been successfully operated with a
coal plough and individual hydraulic props, and important price increases
were instituted for Jerada coal, a Bank mission visited Morocco again in
March 1983. Agreement was reached that the project scope would be refined,
that the Government would further adjust coal prices and reschedule the
company's debts, and that an experienced foreign consultant would carry out
a feasibility study of a modernization/expansion project. The terms of
reference for this study included:
Mi) a review of the geological data base;



-24-
(ii)  a detailed plan for modernization of the mine and expansion of
production from 0.75 to 1.0 million tons per year together with
an evaluation of the technical/economic feasibility; and
(iii) definition of project implementation steps required.
5.03      Belgian Hining Engineers (BME) were selected to carry out the
feasibility study. Financing of the study (US$200,000) was provided from
funds under Loan 2114-MOR (Oil Shale Engineering). A draft final report
was reviewed in May 1984 by CdM and the Bank. The report presented a
satisfactory plan for the modernization/expansion of the mine and
demonstrated the financial and economic viability of the project. At the
request of CdM and the Bank, relatively minor refinements and additions
were made, basically to define more clearly the correlation between timing
of proposed drillholes and mine development work as well as the technical
assistance requirements of CdM for project implementation. The project was
appraised in July 1984.
B.   Project Objectives
5.04      The overall project objectives are:
,i) to reduce the country's balance of payments deficit by reducing
oil imports through substitution by a competitive local energy
resource;
(ii)  to secure continued employment in a less developed region by
modernizing the production facilities and increasing their
efficiency; and
(iii) to maintain an appropriate coal pricing policy.
These objectives are fuliy consistent with the country's overall economic
strategy as well as with the Bank's regional and industrial strategies.
5.05      At the company level the project has the following specific
objectives:
(i) to expand the production capacity of Siege V to 1.0 million tons
per year in line with existing demand and geological/technical
constraints of the mine;
(ii)  to simplify the network of galleries and shafts for increased
productivity and production capacity;
(iii) to improve safety, health and working conditions, mainly through
better ventilation and the partial introduction of more
mechanized working methods; and
(iv)  to improve CdM's organization and mine planning capabilities.



-25-
C.   Project Description
5.06      The project consists of the following major components (Annex
5-1):
(i) a drilling program to prepare underground development work and
shaft sinking for the Siege V mine;
(ii) underground development work in the Siege V mine to prepare
future mining areas and to simplify existing mining areas;
(iii) sinking of a new vertical shaft in the west of Siege V mine to
maintair. the production capacity after depletion of CdM's smaller
mines;
(iv) installation of underground equipment to increase efficiency,
production capacity and to improve safety and health conditions
in the Siege V mine;
>v) installation of surface equipment to secure adequate coal
cleaning, as well as supply of power and compressed air to the
Siege V mine; and
Cvi) technical assistance to support CdM in the implementation of the
above tasks.
The following paragraphs describe these components in more detail and the
environmental, safety and health aspects of the project are also discussed.
(i) Drilling Program
5.07      The drilling program consists of about 25 shallow (up to 500 a)
boreholes and up to 15 deep (up to 1,000 m) boreholes in the eastern
portion of the Jerada coal basin, where all works under the project will be
executed. The shallow holes will help confirm the correct location of the
planned underground galleries and future mining areas. The deep holes are
mainly intended for the confirmation of the reserves for the new shaft as
well as its exact positioning. A few deep holes will also be needed to
confirm the location of deep underground workings. The holes will
predominantly be drilled at full diameter. Only about 15%, in the vicinity
of coal seams, will be cored. The cores will be evaluated and the holes
electrically logged. Correlations will be made with existing information
from underground workings and previous drilling. Not all the holes will
have to be completed before underground work under the project starts.
Some urgent works in well explored ground have already started. One deep
hole is directly allocated to the shaft sinking componect.
(ii) Underground Development Work
5.08      The underground development work consists of the driving of about
14 km of galleries and inclines. A general breakdown of this work is
presented in the table below:

Total         1.2          7.8                5.0            14.0
Galleries and inclines will have cross sections ranging from 8 to 16 m2,
depending on their functions. The advancing method will be conventional:
drilling, blasting and loading with scraper or side dump loaders, mainly
for conveyor transport with occasional intermediate rail transport. Roof
support will be by steel arches set at an average distance of 0.7 m with an
average weight of 350 kg/m of gallery. About 5,000 tons of steel arches
will be needed in total. Annual plans for the sequencing of the
underground development work and its correlation with the depletion of the
Bassin Nord and Siege IV as well as the production increase of Siege V mine
have been prepared by BME.
(i1.) Sinking of the New Vertical Shaft
5.09      The new vertical Shaft no. 3 will be sunk to the northwest of the
present exploitation area of Siege V (Map IBRD 18453). It will be about
900 m deep and have a usable diameter of about 5.5 m. It will be equipped
with the necessary lining, shaft winders, surface installations,
electricity supply and railway connection. From the bottom portion of the
shaft, main galleries will be driven towards the exploitation area. The
purpose of the shaft is to provide additional ventilation (air entry) to
the mine and to shorten access for material and personnel for future mine
workings in the central section of Siege V, which will have to be developed
before the Siege IV mine is depleted. In the long term, this shaft may
also be used as an additional outlet for coal production and provisions
will be made during its construction for that purpose. The location of the
shaft will be in the center of the coal basin, about 3 km northwest of the
existing Shaft 2 and the mouth of the main incline V, through which all
mine production presently is hauled. Subject to confirmation by the deep
drillholes, the shaft will be sunk in a basaltic dyke. The shaft will
allow the extraction of about 15 million tons of coal reserves before
another new shaft has to be sunk further to tDe west. Under terms of
reference agreed with the Bank, BME will carry out the detailed engineering
of all works connected with the sinking of Shaft no. 3. The cost estimates
for this component include one deep bore hole directly related to sinking
of the shaft (para. 5.07), detailed engineering studies (to be carried out
under the contract with BME - para. 5.14) and about 2.5km of access
galleries, to be executed by CdM and requiring an additional 1,300 tons of
steel arches (para. 5.08). Assurances were obtained during negotiations,
that construction of the shaft will be carried out only if and to the



-27-
extent the Bank shall (a) have been furnished with a report on the results
of the drilling program and the engineering studies as well as with a
proposed program of works, and (b) have approved this program of works and
so notified CdN.
(iv)   Installation of  Knderground Equipment
5.10      Underground equipment will be installed to mechanize some of the
most arduous tasks for mine workers, increase the efficiency of underground
transportation, and improve ventilation of underground workings and safety
and health standards. Recognizing the technical and economic constraints
of mechanizing thin seam mining, CdM has restricted the mechanization
program to (i) the winning of coal by plough from only four additional
longwall faces, a method already well proven at Jerada but with limited
applicability due to the mine's geological conditions, and (ii) the trial
operation of a small tunneling machine and a coal shearer with mechanized
support in a suitable seam section.
5.11      The equipment to be installed comprises in particular:
-    equipment for underground mechanization, consisting of 4 coal
ploughs with steel conveyors, individual hydraulic props and
related electrical equipment, I lightweight tunneling machine for
galleries following a coal seam, and 1 shearer together with
self-advancing hydraulic roof support.
-    equipment for mechanization and modernization of transport
consisting of about 5 monorail installations, 3.5 km conveyors,
2 chairlifts for personnel transport in inclines, 2 skips and 300
containers for material transport in inclines and 2 underground
locomotives with 450 cars and 3 km of rail;
-    about 5 principal and 25 auxiliary ventilators for improvement of
veutilation; and
-    safety and health equipment mainly consisting of fire and
dust-fighting equipment and respirators.
(v) Surface Investments
5.12      The improvements to the washing plaat consist of the installation
of a 1,200 ton capacity raw coal bin, an additional coal screening station
for fine coal and a 2 km long conveyor to the waste dump. These
investments will allow the washing of fine coal of 3-6 mm size and thus
assure that ash limits of the power plant will not be exceeded.
(vi) Auxiliary Investmts
5.13      The improvements of power and compressed air supply consist of
reinforcing electric distribution lines with installation of related
switchgear and instrumentation, and addition of a new 1,200 kW compressed
air station. Both of these components also contain some underground work
for installation of cables and piping.



-28-
(vii) Technical Assistance
5.14      CdM and BME signed in January 1985 a technical assistance
contract. The technical assistance program covered by this contract is
based on the completed feasibility study and will provide CdM with services
for follow-up, engineering and staff training required for project
implementation and strengthening of CdH1s organization and operational and
planning capabilities. This program includes some 200 man-months of
consulting services. In particular, the following areas will be covered:
-     follow up on the implementation of the proposed mine development
plan and continuous monitor'ng of its refinewent and improvement
during the project completion period. Two senior mine planning
engineers of BME together with CdM staff will revlew on site
semi-annually the progress in mine development and work out
modifications to the annual and 5-year development plans. This
is expected to enhance considerably CdMs planning capabilities;
-     detailed studies, implementation plans and engineering to assist
CdM staff in the execution of project components which require
special expertise not available at Jerada. Such areas are in
particular the sinking of Shaft no. 3, the new underground
transportation and mine ventilation systems, the operation of the
longwall shearer and the tunneling machine; and the preparation
of technical specifications for bid invitations as well as
evaluation of bids;
training of CdM staff, irL particular on-the-job training for key
underground managerial staff and training for important functions
such as time analysis and preparation of underground works.
(vili) Safety, Bealth and Environment
5.15      Substantial improvements in working conditions and safety are
expected through better ventilation underground, which will increase
airflow rates, reduce dust levels and temperature. Further improvements
are expected from the simplified network of galleries with more efficient
transportation facilities of high safety standard. As a result,
occupational diseases and accident rates are expected to decrease.
Installation of fire and dust fighting equipment is a specific sub-
component of underground equipment. Furthermore, the installation of new
underground cables will also reduce the fire risk.   Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that CdM will carry out the Project and
operate and maintain its mining facilities, in accordance with health and
occupational safety standards acceptable to the Bank. Minimum standards
would be those set forth in the International Labor Organization Codes of
Practice on Prevention of Accidents, due to Fire, Electricity, Explosions.
Moreover, CdM would select appropriate assignments in low risk areas for
workers suffering from early stages of silicosis, and would take measures
to minimize workers' exposure to dust.



-29-
5.16      The project has no adverse effect on the environment.  Once
hauled to the surface, the increased coal production will be handled
satisfactorily by existing installations. A new waste dump will improve
the disposal of shal_ from the washing plant. The new Shaft no. 3 is
located on wasteland and is non-pollutant insofar as it is, at least for
the medium term, an air intake shaft without coal production.
D.   Project Implementation and Schedule
5.17      Jerada's General Manager is the overall project manager who will
delegate responsibility for the execution of the different project
components to the appropriate departments within the Jerada organization.
Coordination of the project execution and follow-up on time schedules will
be the task of the Project Coordinator (para 4.21). The monitoring of mine
development will be the responsibility of the Planning Manager (para. 4.21
and Annex 4-1). He will closely liaise with other managers, in particular
the line managers for coal production in the Siege V mine and for mine
development, who will be responsible for executing the work. CdM personnel
has considerable experience in driving of underground galleries and
inclines, installation of equipment, laying of pipes and cables and
construction of buildings. The project components for which CdM has no
implementation capabilities, the construction of Shaft no. 3 and the
drilling and logging of boreholes and the improvements to the washing plant
will be contracted. For procurement, CdM will use its existing. competent
procurement unit in the Rabat office, assisted by technical experts from
BME for preparation of technical specifications and bid evaluation. Close
liaison with the executing units at Jerada will be assured by the Project
Coordinator. In case of conflict between planning, procurement and
executing agencies the General Manager in his capacity as highest project
authority will intervene.  He is well informed about all components of the
project and has a keen interest in following project progress. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that CdM will carry out the project in
accordance with implementation arrangements acceptable to the Bank.
5.18      Mine development work which has been suggested by WME for 1984 is
in progress and on schedule. Project completion is scheduled for December
1990. A detailed time schedule comprising all major project components is
presented in Annex 5-1. Historically, the Government has assisted CdM in
maintaining schedules by timely approval of procurement documents.
Moreover, under current arrangements CdM has assigned to it a nearly
full-time financial controller. Thus no undue delays are anticipated in
project implementation as a result of Government approval procedures for
procurement.
E.   Reporting Requireaeats
5.19      Assurances were obtained during negotiations from CdN that it
will submit to the Bank quarterly and annual project progress reports in
form and substance acceptable to the Bank. The quarterly report will
contain a listing of the project tasks achieved during the reporting period
and actual project expenditures, information on the project's and CdM
financial status and changes to the implementation schedule. It will also



-30-
contain tables and bar charts for procurement, mine development and
production, which allow a comparison with the original plan. In addition,
the annual report will contain an updated 5-year mining plan as well as a
revised annual mining plan for the period ahead. To this extent, the
annual report will include a set of drawings for different seams and mining
areas, showing completed as well as still to be executed galleries and
incline sections and their correlations with the production plan. These
documents will be prepared after the regular annual review of the plans by
BME. The annual report will also contain a revised project cost estimate
and a report on progress in safety and health provisions. The first
quarterly report is expected to be completed for the period January-March
1985 and the first annual report for the period January-December 1985.
VI. PRWOECT COSTS, FIDAUCIUC AND PROCUREEFT
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      Total project costs are estimated at US$71.7 million, of which
the foreign exchange element is US$47.5 million (66%). About 40Z of the
project cost can be attributed to maintaining the present production level
over the next 5 years, 20% to increase the production rate to 1 million tpy
during that period and 40% to maintain the new production rate after
project implementation. Project costs by component are shown in the
following table. A detailed calculation is available in the Project File.

6.02      The base costs were estimated by BME and reviewed by the Bank and
are expressed in December 1984 terms. For equipment supplies BME used the
quantities and specification of their feasibility study. Price quotations
were obtained from equipment suppliers and compared to recent supplies of
similar equipment to European coal mines. Appropriate adjustments were
made for delivery to Morocco. Spare parts (generally 10%) and provisions
for installation, mostly local, were added where appropriate. For the
construction of Shaft no. 3, budget price quotations were obtained from
shaft sinking firms and comparison was made to the latest executed shaft
sinking projects in Belgium with allowances for Moroccan conditions. The
costs for drilling were estimated on the basis of existing contracts with
BRPN for the shallow holes and a Swiss contractor's bid for the deep
drilling and electrical logging.  For other smaller work contracts such as
improvements to the coal washing plant estimates are based on international
quotations as well as BME's and CdM's recent experience. The costs for
technical assistance are based on an estimate of 200 man-months in
accordance with rates previously negotiated between CdM and BME. Physical
contingencies have been estimated at 20% for the construction of Shaft
no.3, 10% for other works contracts and 5% for equipment. In view of the
good quality of the feasibility study these contingencies are considered
adequate.  Price contingencies have been estimated on the following basis:
(i) for foreign cost 8% in 1985, 9% annually from 1986 to 1989 and 7.5% in
1990, and (ii) for local cost 10  in 1985 and 8% annually thereafter.
B.    Flan
6.03      The total financing required is US$74.0 million of which US$49.3
million (67%) is in foreign exchange and US$24.7 million in local
currency. There is no additional financing of interest during construction
as interest will not be capitalized by CdM. The interest due for the
project-related loans will be paid out of the cash generated by CdM's
operations, like other financial charges on existing debt.
6.04      Financing of foreign cost (except working capital) will be
provided by bilateral and Bank loans on a parallel co-financing basis.
Local cost, including taxes and duties, as well as incremental working
capital will be financed by CdM's own cash generation. The financing plan
is shown below:

6.05      Bilateral financing for equipment for underground mechanization
and the conveyor for waste disposal would be provided by KfW of the Federal
Republic of Germany to the Moroccan Government at their standard country
terms which presently are: 2% p.a. interest and 30 year maturity, including
a 10 year grace period. The total German financing provided is expected to
amount to DM40 million (US$ 12.9 million equivalent). The proceeds would
be onlent to CdM at 6% p.a. interest and 15 year maturity, including a 4
year grace period. German manufacturers of the equipment to be financed
have a large experience in the international market, and competition among
them is expected to be good. Conditions of cross-default will be that (i)
the KfW loan agreement shall not have been concluded by December 31, 1985,
or (ii) that it shall not have hecome effective or the conditions
precendent to disbursement shall not have been met by March 31, 1986.
6.06      Bilateral French financing under a Protocol is estimated to
amount to about FF72 million (US$7.6 million equivalent). This financing
In the form of a mixed credit (approximately 40% as a Treasury loan with a
25-year maturity, including a 10-year grace period and 3% p.a. interest and
60Z in Export Credits with 10 year maturity and 12% p.a. interest) would
apply to selected equipment for transport, ventilation and electrical
distribution, for safety and health equipment, and the raw coal bin. The
financing plan was reviewed during negotiations and found satisfactory. It
will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan that the French
financing shall have been secured. It will be a condition of cross-default
that the French financing agreement shall not have become effective or the
conditions precedent to disbursement shall not have been met by June 30,
1987.
6.07      The proposed Bank loan would be made to CdM, with the Government
guarantee at the Bank standard variable interest rate and 15-year maturity
tailored to the project life, including a 4-year grace period. There will
be a commitment charge of 0.75% for undisbursed loan amounts. In addition
CdM would pay as a guarantee fee to the Government 1.0% of the outstanding
loan balance and would bear the foreign exchange risk. The table below
summarizes the allocation of the different financing sources.

6.08      An overview of foreign procurement is given In the table below.
There are about 12 packages to be financed by the Bank and procured in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Prequalificstion will be required
for work contracts for the sinking of Shaft no. 3. ICB will be applied to
all Bank contracts exceeding US$300,000 equivalent. L1B will be applied to
all other Bank financed contracts, up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0
million equivalent (4% of the Bank loan). These latter contracts will be
awarded on the basis of evaluation of bids invited from at least three
qualified suppliers, each from a different country. BME, which had been
selected to carry out the feasibility study, has been retained by CdM to
provide the technical assistance required. In view of BME's unique
qualifications and experience In thin seam coal mining, their selection is
considered appropriate and consistent with the Bank's quidelines for the
use of consultants.

Another package (drillling contract) amounting to about US$3.0 million,
would follow during the calendar year 1985 and most of the remaining
equipment packages in 1986. The prequalification procedure for the major
shaft constructioa contracts will be initiated in mid-1986 after sufficient
engineering detail bas been worked out by BME. Prior to bid invitation,
all bidding documents for ICB-procured equipment and works will be reviewed
by the Bank (total value, including contingencies, about US$23.9 million or
89% of Bank loan). LIB-procurement packages (US$1.0 million or 4% of Bank
loan) would be subject to post review by the Bank.
6.10      The non-IBRD financed equipaent supplies and works contracts will
be procured in accordance with France's and KfW's procurement rules.  The
coatract for shallow drilling has been awarded to BRPM  The other items
financed by CdM consist mainly of direct force account work. The few
remaining CdM-fiuanced contracts for equipments supplies and works will be
procured in accordance with local rules, which are satisfactory to the
Bank.
D.   Disbursement
6.11      An amount of up to US$2.5 million will be made available for
retroactive financing of expenses incurred after July 31, 1984 for the
technical assistance contract and drilling of deep boreholes.
Disbursements will be made from the different categories of the proposed
Bank loan and in the percentages shbwn below:

The disbursement profile differs from the normal country and industry
profiles insofar as annual disbursements are expected to be relatively
evenly distributed. This is explained by the project implementation
schedule and CdMIs familiarity with similar procurement. Disbursement for
Shaft no. 3 will be conditional upon Bank approval of the work program for
sinking of that shaft.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Projections
7.01      CdM's financial prospects are discussed below in the context of
basic assumptions required for preparing the financial projections for the
Company. These refer to production build-up, the structure of production
costs and coal prices. Detailed assumptions are provided in Annex 7-1.
7.02      The production build-up is based on the results of the 5-year
mine plan prepared by BME and CdM and reviewed by the Bank. The forecast
is considered to be reasonable in that production for 1985 will remain at
their 1984 level (800,000 t) and will gradually increase to 1,000,000 tons
by 1988 with the installation of additional longwall faces in newly
developed mine areas which will allow higher productivity through longer
face lengths and better transportation and ventilation conditions. The
sales volTme forecasts are based on the market analysis developed in para.
3.07, and are expected to prevail as some 85% of CdM's production will go
to two customers, ONE and CIOR, close to the mine.
7.03      CdM's production costs are expected to decrease in 1984 constant
terms by about 9% over the period 1984-89, i.e., from an estimated DH 442/t
(US$511t) in 1984 to DH 404/t (US$47/t) in 1989 as shown In the table
below. This decrease is primarily due to the expected increase in
productivity from 800 kg/manshift ;a 1984 to 1,050 kg/manshift in 1989.

By 1989 most of the existing assets will have been depreciated and the bulk
of depreciation (81%) will come from the new investments. Simdlarly
interest expense will be mostly for loans contracted during the period
(97Z). Major changes in absolute terms are expected for labor costs (16%
decrease, due to the increased production and productivity) and financial
charges (45% increase). Power and transport costs are expected to increase
by 13% mainly because of assumed yearly increases between 3% and 5% of real
power tariffs which are partly offset by productivity gains. Consumables
will go up by 5Z due to the mechanization program, while provisions for
health (included in others) will go down by 12% because of the expected
improvements in health and safety.
7.04      The average realized coal price for 1984 (domestic and export)
was DU 500/t (US$58/t). For 1985 this average price is expected to reach
DH 515/t (US$54/t at current exchange rate). Domestic prices have been
assumed to increase by 7.7% in nominal terms until 1990 and by 6.0%
afterwards. This implies a slight decrease in real terms over the 1985-90
period and constant in real terms thereafter.  Export prices are assumed to
stay constant in real terms as they concern good quality anthracite.
Average coal prices in current terms are projected as follows:

7.05      Based on these main assumptions, financial projections have been
prepared for CdM and are shown in Annexes 7-2 through 7-6. The key
financial indicators are summarized in the folloving table.

The increase in production coupled with an increase in productivity would
have a substantial impact on CdM's earnings. Because of deferred
depreciation amounting to DR 86.2 million in 1984, net income would be zero
during both 1985 and 1986 and would increase rapidly afterwards. With



-38-
substantial investments in the first five years, net fixed assets increase
quickly over this period. The net income/Bales ratio develops favorably
from 0% to about 9%. Debt service coverage is satisfactory with a ratio of
3.3 in 1985 and fluctuating thereafter between 2.3 and 4.2. The current
ratio increases from 2.3 to 3.6 over the period principally because of
accumulating cash surpluses while the long-term debt/equity ratio, after
deteriorating through the first three years, Improves constantly thereafter
since CdM is not assumed to contract new loans after 1989.
B.   Financial Covenants
7.06      Profitability, creditworthiness and a sufficient cash flow are
essential elements in CdM's future performance and its capability to carry
out the Project as scheduled and to manage operations efficiently. A
period of new financial difficulties with accumulating debts and dependency
on Government subsidies could result in actual bankruptcy and cut off the
only source of internal coal supply in Morocco. It is therefore essential
that the financial health of CdM be assured as long as this is feasible
under competitive conditions. Since the major factor in past financial
problems of CdM has been an inadequate coal pricing policy this should
therefore represent a major policy covenant (para. 3.06). In addition, the
Bank should ascertain that beyond the scope of the Project, CdM does not
make any decision which could jeopardize its capability of zomplyiug with
obligations to service the debt linked to the Project or of carrying out
its operations with an adequate liquidity basis. Therefore, assurances
were obtained from CdM at negotiations on the following covenants:
(i)  CdM will maintain a long term debt/equity ratio of no more than
67:33 until January 1, 1991 and 50:50 afterwards;
(ii)  CdM will not incur any debt which would cause its debt service
coverage ratio to be less than 1.5. CdM would also submit
not later than November, 30 of each year its proposed program of
capital expenditures for the Bank's review; and thereafter carry
out only the program of capital expenditures as agreed with the
Bank; and
(iii) CdM will maintain at all times a curreat ratio of no less than
1.3.
C. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.07      The financial rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
incremental costs and benefits in 1984 real terms. These streams have been
determined on the basis of a comparison of "with' and "without" project
developments, whereby "without" project, in line with BME's feasibility
study, reflects a gradual deterioration of mining activities with only
minor replacement investment resulting in a production decrease from the
current level of about 800,000 tons to 600,000 tons in 1990. The "with"
Project developments are based on project investments and reinvestments of
equipment and materials after the implementatioa period resulting in a
production build-up from currently 800,000 tons to 1 million tons in 1988.



-39-
Production build up, costs, and prices assumptions have been defined in
paras. 7.02, 7.03 and 7.04.  All other major assumptions are found in Annex
7-7.
7.08      Under these assumptions the incremental financial rate of return
is 24X before taxes and 16% after taxes.

101 Increase In operating costs              14
18-aos. delay in project implementation    13
As could be expected, the rate of return is most sensitive to a 10% drop in
revenues which could be the result of insufficient price adjustments.
The price review mechanism (para. 3.06) has been designed to minimize this
risk and assure CdM's financial viability. The rate of return is less
sensitive to increases in operating costs which could occur if major cost
items such as wages and prices or consumables rise more in real terms than
assumed in the projections or if operations are managed less efficiently
than estimated.
7.09      In addition to the incremental rate of return presented above, a
rate of return on the investment considering all existing assets as sunk
costs has been calculated. Based on the same assumptions this after-tax
financial rate of return is 34%. This rate is higher because of the
re ,tively limited investment required to continue producing and expand
from 800,000 tpy to 1,000,000 tpy.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01      The project is an important part of the Government's strategy for
the energy sector. It would contribute to maintenance and increase of the
the production potential of the Jerada coal mine, currently the only
exploitable coal resource of the country represents a major economic
activity in the Eastern region. Project implementation would result in
modernization of the mine and thus increase production and productivity.
Major benefits would include (i) contribution to the Government's program
of energy substitution (coal for oil) with the objective of reducing
electricity production costs and saving foreign exchange; (ii) promotion of
local energy production for substitution against imported energy with the
result of additional foreign exchange savings; (iii) effective utilization
of the existing coal potential and the mine-mouth power plant and thus
reduction of costs of electricity production; and (iv) maintenance of
employment and economic infrastructure in a low potential area in eastern
Morocco.

A.   Econouic Rate of Return
8.02       The incremental economic rate of return has been calculated on
the basis of production scenarios, capital and operating costs used in the
financial analysis with the following exceptions: (i) import duties and
taxes were not taken into account; and (ii) a conversion factor of 0.8 was
applied to al local labor costs since the Jerada coal mine represents one
of few employment possibilities in the north-eastern border area and
opportunity costs of labor are estimated to be lower than realized earnings
at the mine.
8.03      Coal prices have been determined on the basis of Import parity
prices derived from recent forecasts for international coal prices.
Although Jerada coal is anthracite, international steam coal prices have
been used as comparator since most of the Jerada production consists of low
quality fines, used for electricity generation. FOB prices were adjusted
to take into account shipment sizes acceptable to Moroccan ports, and
unloading, handling and Interior transport costs. A constant CIF price of
US$45/ton has been used. Port handling and transport costs are estimated
to remain constant in real terms over the period. Port handling has been
taken at US$7/t (1984 terms) and transport costs at US12.3/t km (rail) or
US$10/ton (truck) for transport from the west coast or the north coast
respectively. Export prices for Jerada high quality anthracite are
expected to remain constant throughout the period at US$98/t (1984 terms
FOB Moroccan port).
8.04      The coal production drop in the 'without project' case would
force ONE to switch to alternative, more costly primary energy for power
generation. Since all Moroccan coal fired power stations are fully
utilized to contribute to the base load6/ and hydropower is not suitable
for base load supply, practically any shortfall in power generation from
Jerada would have to be replaced by additional generation from existing oil
fired stations with spare generation capacity. The most likely least cost
electricity generation would then be from the new Mohammedia oil-fired
units since the construction of a new power plant on the coast to replace
Jerada would not be economically justified (para. 3.05). Due to the higher
fuel cost, electricity production cost would be higher by about US¢1/kWh or
20% of cash cost. This has been reflected in the calculation of the
opportunity cost for Jerada coal (Annexes 8-1 and 8-2). Under the
assumptions summarized above, the economic rate of return for the base case
has been calculated at 36% (Annex 8-3).  The high value is principally due
to the rehabilitation character of the project which provides necessary
investments for an on-going concern with substantial existing
infrastructure, personnel and experience. Sernsitivity of the rate of
return has been calculated for a decrease in coal sales, an increase in
capital costs, and an increase in operating costs. The results of these
sensitivity tests are summarized in the table below.
6/ Present base load is about 500 MW. Present coal based generation
capacity (Jerada and Roche Noire) at 70% load factor is 158 MW, which
will be increased to 368 MW after startup of the new Mohamedia units
in 1985.

B.   Freign ExSh!nge Benefits
8.05      The foreign exchange benefits due to the project that would
accrue to Morocco are substantial.  The incremental export earnings would
increase form US$0.2 million in 1985 to US$3 million by 1990, in 1984
terms. In addition foreign exchange savings due to the use of Jerada coal
for both the cement and power sectors would stand at US$27.0 million in
1984 terms by 1990. These additional earnings and savings would largely
exceed the estimated US$6 million in debt service, in 1984 terms, by 1990.
As a result, total foreign exchange earnings and savings due to the project
would after 1990 range around 4% of Morocco's average oil import
expenditures in recent years.
C.   Project Risks
8.06      The project carries geological, technical and economic risks that
are prevalent in underground thin seam coal mining:
(a) The geological risks are of two kinds: (i) lower mineable
reserves than estimated and (ii) difficult geological conditions
linked with the shaft sinking. While these risks, like in other
mining projects, cannot be fully removed, they have been
minimized by incorporating into the project a drilling program at
the beginning which is designed to verify the continuity of
geological conditions. Assurances were obtained to ensure that
the drilling program is completed and evaluated before
construction of Shaft no. 3 is started (para. 5.09). In
addition, 20% contingency provisions have been made for the shaft
construction.
(b) The technical risks relate to the possibility of CdM not
attaining the planned production build-up. These risks have been
minimized by the defined reinforcement of CdM's organization and
a well specified technical assistance program adapted to CdM's
needs.
(c) The economic and financial risks relate to the long-term
competitiveness of Jerada coal -ris-a-vis imported coal. As
described earlier the comparative advantage of Jerada lies in its
location close to its two main consumers (85% of production).
Both for the Jerada power plant and the CIOR cement factory
alternative fuels would be costlier than Jerada coal and this



-42-
trend is expected to prevail in the future. Marketing
arrangements between CdM and ONE have therefore been entered
into, and similar arrangements are expected to be concluded
between CdM and CIOR (para. 3.07). Moreover, assurances were
obtained at negotiations on implementation of a coal pricing
policy in accordance with principles of opportunity cost pricing
(para. 7.06).
IX.     K       RCD ASND __D_ONS
9.01      The following topics were reviewed during negotiations and found
to be satisfactory:
(i) the principal objectives of the Government's future energy
policy, (para. 2.23); and
(ii)  the definitive financing plan for the project (para. 6.06).
9.02      During negotiations the following agreements were obtained:
(a) From the Government:
to adjust Jerada coal prices annually in line with the
development of its opportunity cost (para. 3.06).
(b)  From CdM
(i)  to provide yearly audited financial statements to the Bank
(para. 4.25);
(ii)  not to start construction of Shaft no. 3 before the drilling
program and the engineering are completed and have led to
results acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.09);
(iii) to carry out the project and maintain its mining facilities
in accordance with health and occupational safety standards
acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.15);
(iv)  to carry out the project in accordance with implementation
arrangements acceptable to the Bank (para. 5.17);
(v)  to provide quarterly and annual project progress reports
(para. 5.20); and
(vi)  to abide by the financial covenants presented in para. 7.06.
9.03      The following is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan:
that the French Protocol has been signed (para. 6.06).



-43-
9.04      The following are conditions of cross-default:
(i)   that the KfW loan agreement shall not have been concluded by
December 31, 1985;
(ii)   that the KfW loan agreement shall not have become effective
or the conditions precedent to disbursement shall not have
been met by March 31, 1985; and
(iii)   that the French finaLcing agreement shall not have become
effective or the conditions precedent to disbursement shall
not have been met by June 30, 1987.
9.05      The following is a condition of disbursement:
that disbursement for Shaft no. 3 will be conditional upon Bank
approval of the work program for sinking the Shaft.
9.06      Given the preceding agreements and assurances, the Project is
suitable for a Bank loan to CdM with the guarantee of the Government of
Morocco, of US$27.0 million equivalent for a period of 15 years, including
four years' grace.

MOROCCO - JERADA COAL MINE MODERNIZATION AND EXPANSION PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. Inflation
1.        Domestic inflation has been assumed at 10% in 1985 and 81 p.a.
thereafter, international inflation at 8% in 1985, 9% from 1986-1989, 7.5%
in 1990 and at 6% thereafter. Coal prices have been assumed to grow at
7.7% annually until 1990 and at 6Z thereafter.
B. Production
2.        Production build-up has been assumed to follow the assessment of
the feasibility study (Sales Forecasts).
C. Investments
3.        In addition to project investments, the following capital
expenditures have been taken into account: replacement, mine works after
the project, and housing. The assumed depreciation periods are as follows:
Depreciation Period
Investment Item                           (years)
Shaft and incline 7                         20
Galleries, boreholes,
surface investments                       10
Equipment                                    5
Housing                                     10
Inflation rates applied have been weighted in accordance with local and
foreign currency shares. Existing fixed assets have been taken into
account for depreciation on the basis of total annual depreciation as
forecast by CdM.
D. Costs
4.        The Income Statement shows the development of production costs.
All elements of production costs have been estimated at their predicted
1984 values, escalated by 101 for the base year 1985, except for
depreciation which was calculated in the Fixed Assets Schedule.
(a)  Consumables:  22% were assumed independent and 78Z dependent on
production. These real values were added and adjusted by a
weighted inflation rate for a 70% foreign and 301 local share.
(b) Labor: was assumed to remain unchanged in real terms. The 1985
base amount for wages and salaries was therefore escalated only
by local inflation.



-54-
ANNEX 7-1
Page 2 of 3
(c) Power and utilities: 90% of the 1985 base amount was assumed
independent and 10% dependent on production. Real tariff
increases of 5% annually until 1989 and 3X annually thereafter
have been assumed In line with the proposed strategy for the
energy sector. The values in real terms thus calculated were
escalated by local inflation.
(d) Transport: 92% were assumed dependent and 8% independent from
production. The real values were escalated by local inflation.
(e)  Taxes, administrative charges and provisions were assumed
independent from production and their 1985 base values were
escalated by the local inflation rate.
(f) Income tax was calculated at 50% of net income before taxes.
(g) Interest and fees: interest on existing debts bas been taken
into account. For the Bank loan the interest rate bas been
assumed at 9.29% p.a., the guarantee fee to the Government at 1%
on the outstanding balance, and the commitment fee as 0.75% on
average undisbursed amounts.  Interest on the KfW loan has been
defined as 6% with a commitment fee of 0.5% on undisbursed
amounts. Interest on the French financing has been taken as 8%
on the average. The interest payments have been calculated on
average outstanding amounts in the middle of each year. Both for
the Bank and for the KfW loan, grace periods of four years and
total maturities (including grace) of 15 years have been assumed
while the French financing has an average grace period of five
years with an average maturity of 16 years.
E. Balance Sheet, Working Capital and Funds Flow
(a) Current assets: Cash was defined as one half month of wages and
salary payments, receivables as 12.5Z of domestic sales of one
year, inventories of consumables as 25% of consumable consumption
in one year, coal inventories were considered constant in real
terms with 50,000 tons valued at average coal prices.
(b)  Current liabilities:  Payables were defined as 25Z of consumable
consumption in one year plus 17% of transport costs.
(c) Fixed assets have been calculated in the Fixed Assets Schedule
along with depreciation to determine net fixed assets.
(d) Outstanding long-term debt has been calculated in the Loan
Schedule and transferred to the balance sheet for existing and
new debt along with the current portion which was included in
current liabilities. In the Loan Schedule all different sources
of existing and new long-term debt are listed in detail.

ANNEX 7-1
Page 3 of 3
(e) Other fixed assets, existing provisions, subscribed capital and
Government equity have been assumed to remain unchanged in
current terms, Retained earnings have been calculated as
accumulated net income plus an initial amount of DR 2.1 million
for existing reserves.
(f) Deferred depreciation has been assumed to be written off by
yearly amounts defined In the Income Statement.
