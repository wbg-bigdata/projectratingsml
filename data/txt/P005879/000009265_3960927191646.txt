This Report is based on two FAO/CP missions to People's Democratic Republic of
Yemen, which assisted Government in the identification (October 1987) and
preparation (February 1988) of the project, and evaluation by an IDA
preappraisal mission (July 1988) of the FAO/CP Project Preparation Report
(44/88 CP-PDY 27 of June 5, 1988). The final appraisal mission (Februlary
1989) consisted of: Messrs. Michael A. Nightingale, Agricultural Economist
(Leader); Oscar Honisch, Agriculturalist; Luis Moscoso, Irrigation Engineer;
and Colin Bruce, Economist.

Agrarian Reform
Project ObjectiveS   The proposed project would provide a program for conso-
and Desription:    lidating, expanding and ensuri.ng sustained development of
lano and water resources in the Wadi Hadramawt served
area. In addition to completing physical construction,
developing organization and management, and intensifying
agricultural production, the project would support policy
adjustments for long-term lease agreements over land and
pumps, greater autonomy by farm units on cropping patterns,
machinery and marketing, improved planning and utilization
of water resources and expanded agricultural support
services. Financing would be included for:
(a) construction of 59 tubewells and irrigation
infrastructure for 3,025 ha; (b) rehabilitatinig spate
irrigation works on 2,700 ha; (c) establishib'p an
Irrigation Maintenance Unit (IMU) in Wadi Hadramawt;
(d) increasing cropping intensity and consolidating
agricultural services on some 6,25C ha of groundwatet
irrigated land (3,225 ha existing/3,025 ha under proposed
project); (e) strengthening cooperatives' management to
streamline inputs supply and marketing of vegetables and
fruit; (f) project operating expenditures and (g) training
and technical assistance personnel for developing irriga-
tion systems and for improving agricultural productivity.
Project organization would be assured by the existing PMU
and extension services and backup research would continue
to be supplied through tl.e Agriculture Research and
Extension Department of the Ministry of Agriculture atd
Agrarian Reform.
Benefits and Risks: Immediate benefits would be sustainable increase in crop
returns and higher standards of living for some 1,250 farm
families as well as increased food supplies and improved
services for irrigation and agriculture in the Wadi
Hadramawt area. At full development (PYIO), estimated
foreign exchange savings from import substitution would
reach US$6.5 million p.a. The project would also help to
ensure optimu;n utilization and conservation of land and
water resources. rhe estimated economic rate of return



- ii -
is 13.11. Cost overrun is unlikely because project
investments were derived from ongoing project experience.
As the existing PMU will provide continuity for project
developments, delays in implementation would be avoided.
Sensitivity tests show that 20% decline in projected
benefits wottld reduce IRR to 101. The main risk concerns
sustaining projected cropping intensities, which are
technically and organizationally feasible given adequate
inputs supplies and further liberalization of controls.
Government has alread initiated significant policy changes
which will minimize these risks, and additional assurances
were obtained at negotiations.

PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
THIRD WADI HADRAMAWI AGRICULTURAL PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) has a geographic
area of 333,000 square kilometers (km') and a population of nearly
2.3 million, with an estimated growth rate of 2.5X per annum. Average per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1987 is estimated at US$420. Some 60S
of the country's total population, iiving in widely scattered rural locations,
depends on agriculture and fisheries.
1.02     Scant natural resources and a harsh climate severely limit the
country's agricultural potential, and food accounts for about one-third of the
total import bill. In order to reduce dependence on food imports, Government
has placed highest priority on intensifying the use of agricultural
resources.  In addition to limited land and water resources, the main
constraints affecting agricultural production are: shortages of trained
personnel, inadequate supply of inputs, and inappropriate institutional,
produ'ction and pricing policies which obstruct sustainable development.
Government is now introducing a series of policy changes aimed at overcoming
these constraints, by partially liberalizing the agriculture sector,
stimulating private sector activities and expanding agricultural productivity.
1.03     Wadi Hadramawt, a key area for agricultural production, is located in
the center of PDRY and physically isolated by mountains and desert. The first
IDA agricultural project in this area, First Wadi Hadramawat Agricultural
Project (WHAP I), was initiated in 1976 (Cr. 615-YDR, US$7.0 million),
focussing on infrastructure, pilot developments and instiLution building, and
was completed in 1982. The second phase project (WHAP II, Cr. 1346-YDR,
US$9.0 million) has initiated modern agricultural development and will be
completed in 1990. IDA's involvement in this project helped attract
cofinancing of US$22.6 million from Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development (AFESD) and Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED).
Associated axpert studies made since 1980 (para. 3.03), including groundwater
modelling and reassessment of water resources of the Wadi Hadramawt catchment
area, indicate that planning assumptions for WHAP II (based on lack of
knowledge of wadi source potential) were too cautious. From predictions of
water levels and salinity, the studies concluded that 65 additional wells
could be constructed with annual potential for pumping 47 Mm'3 of water to
expand irrigation by at least 3,000 ha (giving a total potential development
area of 6,500 ha) with annual cropping intensity of up to 150X.
1.04     WHAP II has achieved significant impact on irrigation improvements,
institution building and agricultural developments. However, there is need
for a coordinated development program; agricultural production is suboptimal,
0&M of ir-igation structures is inadequate and Gover-ament policies are
hindering sustainability of development. The proposed project would fucus r n
these aspects.

-2-
1.05     The Government of PDRY has requested further IDA assistance to help
finance priority development of the Third Wadi Hadramawt Agricultural Project
(WHAP III or Phase III). Based on the water resources study (para. 3.03), an
FAO/CP mission visited PDRY in October 1987 and again in February 1988 to
assist the Government in the identification and preparation of a Phase 'II
project.  An Tna mission visited PDRY in July 1988 for preappraisal, based on
an FAO/CP Project Preparation Report (44/88 CP-PDY 27 of June 5, 1988), and
the final appraisal mission was in February 1989.
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Resource BaSe
2.01     PDRY is mostly desert or arid scrub land, with about 120,000 ha
classified as potentially cultivable. The annual cropped area ranges from
50,000 to 70,000 ha and is concentrated in small areas which depend on
seasonal, variable spate flows from some twelve widely separated Wadi
systems. The more reliable crop production areas are those irrigated by
pumping groundwater; these are limited to approximately 25,000 ha, of which
Wadi Hadramawt is the most important.
2.02     The climate is arid-tropical with moderate winter temperatures and
hot and humid summers. Rainfall is highly erratic, occurring mostly in the
winter and spring seasons and nationwide averages less than 200 mm annually.
These conditions, scarce groundwater resources and the absence of any
significant perennial wadi flow control agricultural development.
B. Sectoral Context
An Overview of the Economy
2.03     Since its creation as a sovereign state in 1967, PDRY's economy has
been besed on centralized planning and collective ownership of production
resources. Economic growth, which previously averaged 62 per annum, slowed
down considerably during ;978-87 due to mounting pressures caused by:
rehabilitation of the country's infrastructure damaged by 1982 floods,
drought--extending from mid-1983 to 1986, civil hostilities in 1986, and a
sharp decline in workers' remittances (which previously contributed about 50%
to Gross National Product) from US$427 million in 1985 to US$288 million in
1986 and to US$304 million in 1987. GDP, whirh declined in 1982, grew by
about 2Z during 1983-84, was stagnant in 1985 and declined again by about 122
in 1986 as a result of import restrictions and reduced investment activity.
There was a slight recovery in 1987, but production 1.evels achieved in the
mid-1970s are not likely to reco-er before 1990 when the situation should
improve as newly exploited oil revenues start to flow.
The Agriculture Sector
2.04     Agriculture in the Economy.  While output from crops, livestock and
fishing accounts for only 16% of GDP, some 41Z of the country's economically
active labor force is employed in the agriculture sector. Although some
importation of food is inevitable due  o the limited agricultural resource
base, the share of imports has increased to 30% in recent years, including 902
of cereal requirements, 502 of livestock products and 252 of vegetables and



-3-
fruit. Government's priority for the Third Five-Year Plan is to reverse this
trend by raising productivity from traditional crops and livestock and by
attaining self-sufficiency in vegetables and fruit.
2.05     Of the 60,000 ha cultivated annually, it is estimated that 802 is in
field crops (cereals, 30,030 ha; forage, 15,000 ha; and cotton and pulses,
3,000 ha), 12S is in permanent crops (dates, 5,400 ha; fruit trees, 1,200 ha;
and coffee, 600 ha), and 81 (4,800 ha) is in vegetables and soft fruits.
National livestock resources are estimated at 1.25 million goats, 800,000
sheep, 80,000 camels, 75,000 cattle and 820,000 poultry.
2.06     Sectoral Performance.  During the period 1973-80, the performance of
the agricultural sector was low, with GDP increasing at some 1.8% per annum at
constant prices. In the 1980s, the growth rate has expanded to average 2.7%
p.a. However, this includes relatively good years (1985: 8.51) which are
masked by declines caused by massive flooding in 1982 and subsequent drought.
Growth was also obstructed in 1986 by severe restrictions in imports. As a
result, sector performance during the second five-year plan period (1981-85)
was substantially below the 9% target average annual growth rate.
2.07     Sector Organization.  About 902 of cultivation is by individuals,
and, of this, alout two-thirds is farmed by the cooperatives, about 251
belongs to private farmers, and another 10% is utilized by 42 state farms.
Although Government control in the sector has, traditionally, been pervasive,
affecting investment, production and marketing of strategic crops, in
practice, national production plans are now being based on farmers' choice of
crops.
2.08     Cooperatives play a key role in implementing agricultural policies.
They supply farm inputs, pumps, agricultural machinery and spare parts, not
only to members but also to private farmers. They coordinate crop production
acreages and targets, collect agricultural production taxes and assist in the
provision of credit and the marketir.g of agricultural produce.
2.09     Historically, prices for farm inputs and farmgate prices of major
crops have been controlled by the Government. In recent years, however,
farmers have been permitted to sell up to 401 of some crops--especially fruits
and vegetables--in local markets. Animal fodder and livestock are the most
important agricultural output for which prices are not controlled and where
marketing is handled exclusively by the private sector. State marketing
agencies handle most of major crops, like: wheat, maize, sorghum, sesame and
tobacco, plus some 401 of fruits and vegetables. Individual farmers have
traditionally paid production taxes to Government averaging 101 on all major
crops except fodder, while state farms are subject to 85% tax on profits.
2.10     Prices for most agricultural commodities are laid down by Government
supposedly at a level to allow reasonable margins for producers. However,
there is no routine mechanism for monitoring producer returns or dounstream
marketing costs, and most prices have remained static since the mid-1970s. In
1987, MAAR introduced s-easonal differentials on producer prices for onions; as
a result, production expanded in 1988 and imports were eliminated. This
experience has spurred Government on to reduce marketing controls. Fertilizer
prices have been constant since 1980 and farmers are paying twice as much as
the total costs. Labor costs have increased in line with scarcity of supply
and expanding demand.



-4-
2.11     Constraints on ARricultural Production.  Apart from scant natural
resources and the periodic hazards of floods and droughts, agricultural
production has been constrained by inappropriate policies and weak support
services. These included: (i) uneertainties over cultivation rights, which
discouraged long-term developments and routine maintenance; (ii) centrally
planned and inflexible crop production programs, which tried to specify
farmers' cropping patterns; (iii) shortages of crop production inputs, which
obstructed optimum and timely planting; and (iv) inadequate incentives
regarding input/output prices and produce marketing, which reduced
prodactivity.
2.12     Government has recognized the problems caused by these policies and
strategies and, in 1989, started to introduce measures to reverse their
effect. These include: (.) issuance of documents specifying ownership of
fruit trees and date palms, which is now ongoing, and agreement to issue
documents specifying cultivation/ownership rights on farmland for existing
farmers and their families, as soon as legislation is enacted (para. 4.03);
(ii) acceptance of production planning for each governorate based on farmers'
choices; (iii) review of the role of parastatal organizations (paras. 2.18,
2.19 and 3.22), revision of procurement and pricing procedures, and increase
in foreign exchange allocation for crop production inputs (para. 5.13); and
(iv) acceptance of role for private traders in wholesale/retail marketing of
fruit and vegetables, and corresponding deregulation of prices (para. 2.20).
Introduction of these measures is proceeding in phases and IDA is assisting
the process through continuing sector discussions.
National Institutions
2.13     The Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR) is the
principal agency responsible for agriculture and i3 structured along
functional and regional lines. The Ministry has eight main Departments:
Administration and Finance, Planning, Irrigation (DOI), Plant Production
(previously called State Farms), Cooperatives (DOC), Research and Extension
(R&E), Animal Wealth (DAW), and Machinery Rental Service (MRS). These
Departments implement and supervise MAAR policies and projects. In all seven
Governorates, there is a Department of Agriculture which is divided into
sections corresponding to central line-departments.
2.14     The line-departments suffer from shortages of trained and experienced
staff and, at governorate level, some of the line-departments are not even
represented. At the central level, there is particular need for:
(a) strengthening survey, analytical and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)
capability; (b) restructuring DAW to be production oriented; (c) establishing
a suitable agency in the Department of Irrigation (DOI) for coordinating and
supervising the operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation developments;
and (d) developing an effective planning capacity for policy and sector
analyses and project preparation.
2.15     Cooperatives.  Since the Agrarian Reform of 1969, 56 cooperatives
have been formed, including 35 which are service and 21 production-cum-service
cooperatives. Total membership is reported to be approximately 54,000, of
which 46,000 are individual members and 8,000 are in production groups. Poor
management and central controls have prevented effective development of
cooperatives. Cooperatives make substantial deductions from farmers' sales,
including 5% commission both for supply of inputs and for marketing and 3%



-5-
social security charge. Despite the level of deductions, most cooperatives in
the country are unprofitable because of low financial turnover, untrained
management, high overhead and personnel costs and financial weakness.
However, the four cooperatives in the proposed project area are relatively
efficient and financially stable. In 1988, the Department cf Cooperatives
made a nationwide study with a view to improving cooperative services. This
has led to proposals for granting more autonomy, reducing Government controls
over organization and wages, anid strengthening operation efficiency. These
changes are beirAg enacted as part of Government's moves for liberalizing the
agriculture sector. These proposals have been reviewed by IDA and are
acceptable. At negotiations, an assurance was obtained that MAAR would ensure
that training is provided for strengthening management of each of the four
cooperatives in the project area and that trends in their long-term debt to
equity ratios and total liability situations are monitored annually so as to
ensure theih continued financial viability [para. 7.02(a)].
2.16     Agriculture Research and Extension Services (R&E).  The Department of
Agricultural Research and Extension was established in 1980. Two research
stations, one located at El Kod close to Aden and the other at Seiyun in the
project area, are the major research facilities in the country. Agricultural
extension services operate in each governorate. They were initiated in Wadi
Hadramawt under WHAP I and are being strengthened under WHAP II. The Training
and Visit (T&V) approach has been introduced through the ongoing Agricultural
R&E Project (Credit 1557-YDR) in Hadramawt, Lahej and Abyan Governorates, and
includes effective coordination between research and field extension
operations.
2.17     Field extension services are operating well and are appreciated by
farmers. With continued support and improved facilities, this service would
evolve into a problem-oriented practical advice and demonstration service.
There is urgent need for field extension services to provide more intensive
production systems and improved production recommenidations to the farmers, in
particular for groundwater based agricultural areas. In research, particular
attention is needed for technological work on irrigation agronomy, farm
mechanization, appropriate farming systems, in-field trials, crop rotations,
fertilizer application, cultural techniques, screening and selection of crop
and forage varieties, and evaluation of indigenous livestock species.
2.18     Machinery Rental Service (MRS).  Sixteen field stations nationwide
provide heavy earth-moving equipment and land cultivation services for farmers
on a rental basis and machinery maintenance services for other agencies. The
efficiency of MRS units varies. Their main problems are lack cf foreig.a
exchange allocation for purchasing spare parts, unreliable and inadequate
operating funds, weak management and inadequate coordination with cooperatives
and farmers and acutely seasonal demand. Machinery rental charges have been
fixed since 1983, and now cover only cash operating costs. However, this
results more from poor work organization and low productivity due to
inadequate incentives for operators, than to low unit charges. The MRS in
Seiyun, with good maintenance facilities and active engineering staff,
operates with reasonable technical efficiency and could be adapted to provide
sustainable backup and servicing facilities for farmers (para. 3.22). In
time, when Agricultural Production Units (APU) are operating commercially,
there would be scope for private sector involvement in farm machinery services
(para. 2.12).



-6-
2.19      The Public Corporation for Agricultural Services (PCAS) has monopoly
control over inputs supplies; it fixes prices a. ually (July-June) for farm
inputs, pumps, agricultural machinery and spares. At current rates, farmers
are charged double the actual costs for importation and distribution of
fertilizers and chemicals. This results from inefficient management in PCAS
and inadequate review procedures, both of which are now being examined in the
context of Government's liberalization moves. This is expected to involve
rationalizing its staffing, streamlining its organization and improving links
with cooperatives (para. 2.12).
2.20     Marketing Channels.  The Public Corporation for Marketing Fruits and
Vegetables (PCMFV) and Home Trade Corporation (HTC) buy, store and market
fruits and vegetables, and cereals, respectively. Purchases have
traditionally been made through cooperatives. The main problems associated
with marketing by these corporations are poor cor lination, and the lack of
proper transport and spoilage in handling of vegetables and fruit, which
result in excessive losses. Government's libeialization moves for the
agriculture sector include policy and institutional reforms for the operation
of private traders and the adjustment in PCMFV operations to provide wholesale
services and to develop modern retail outlets (para. 2.12). As a result,
since early 1989, private traders have bee l enabled to freely operate in the
marketing of farm produce.
2.21     Agricultural Credit.  The National Bank of Yemen (NBY) is the sole
commercial bank.  It has 28 branches, amongst which, all agricultural credit
is coordinated by one branch in Aden. NBY's net assets in 1987 were
equivalent to US$392.6 million, with an assets/liabilities ratio of 1.5.
Total advances (1982-1987) averaged US$307 million p.a., of which
US$26.4 million (8.6X) was for agriculture and fisheries. Agricultural loans
are mostly made to cooperatives who on-lend to individuals or farmers' groups
for short-term (1 year) or medium-term (7 years) periods. The interest rate,
set by the Ministries of Finance and Planning, together with the Bank of Yemen
(Central Bankl and in consultation with MAAR, is currently set at 5-1/22 p.a.,
which is positive in real terms. NBY operates reasonably efficiently,
although its management systems are antiquated. NBY is providing medium-term
loans to WHAP II beneficiaries for irrigation pumps and farm machinery
(para. 4.23). Farmers in Wadi Hadramawt have a good record of loan repayment.
2.22     Training.  The Nasser College of Agricultural Sciences is part of
Aden University and offers a Bachelor's degree program in agriculture. An
agricultural training institute located at Lahej provides training to
intermediate technicians. The Giar Training Center offers short-term,
in-service training courses for the staff from extension, cooperatives and
state farms. The Dar Sa'ad Cooperative Training Institute offers training
courses in management skills to state farms and cooperatives' employees.
These institutions generally receive insufficient operating funds and, as a
result, the practical field-oriented aspects offered and training courses for
farmers are insufficient. WHAP II and the research and extension services are
staffed mostly by personnel with initial training from the Nasser College or
the technical institutes. This basic training would be supplemented by
in-service training through the project.
Public Investment in the Sector
2.23     The Government's Third Five-Year Plan (1986-1990) provides for total
investment of YD 612.3 million.  This includes YD 89.9 million, or 14.72, for



-7-
agriculture, which represents an increase of nearly 30% over the provisions of
the Second Plan. Actual investment expenditures for agriculture in 1986 and
1987 totalled YD 34.3 million, and estimated expenditures for agriculture and
fisheries totalled YD 16.9 million f-r 1988.
2.24     The Third Plan is targeted on:  (i) expanding crop production by 361
(especially from sorghum, cotton, fruits and vegetables) through improvements
in irrigation, farm machinery utilization, and inputs supplies; and
(ii) expanding livestock production by 21X through improvements in selection
of indigenous stock and forage supplies. These objectives reflect sector
priorities and significant achievements have already been realized in
vegetables, fruit and forage production. However, they are unlikely to be
fully realized due to the combined effect of drought (1986), foreign exchange
restrictions (1987/88) and the disincentive of agriculture policies. While
little can be done to directly counter natural hazards, strategies for
diversifying cropping patterns and improving resource conservation should
contribute indirectly. Revised allocations should improve the foreign
exchange situation for the short term and oil revenues should give greater
alleviation in the medium term. The incentives from policy revisions now
underway are likely to have significant impact on production. Due to
developments under WHAP II, incremental output in Wadi Hadramaawt is expected
to be close to Third Plan objectives; and this trend is likely to accelerate
under the proposed project.
C. IDA Involvement in the Sector
2.25     IDA Operations.  IDA has financed three fisheries (US$19.5 million)
and five agricultural (US$34.2 million) projects. Of the latter, four
projects have been for the development of irrigated agriculture in Wadis
Tuban, Hadramawt (2) and Beihan, while the fifth concerns the strengthening of
national agricultural research and extension (R&E). In addition to support by
KFAED and AFESD for WHAP II, cofinancing of US$6.1 million has been provided
by AFESD for the Wadi Tuban Project (completed 6/30/84), and US$6.0 million by
the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) for the Wadi Beihan
Project (completed 12/88).
2.26     The Wadi Tuban Project (Cr. 768-YDR), which was closed one year
behind schedule, sought to improve agricultural production on cooperative and
state farms totalling 8,500 ha through increased use of inputs, improved
practices and the construction of a groundwater irrigation network. The Wadi
Beihan Project (Credit 1145-YDR), which was extended by one year, has exceeded
its objective of increasing agricultural production on about 4,000 ha of mixed
spate- and well-irrigated lands. The ongoing R&E Project (Cr. 1557-YDR)
started in 1986 and is progressing well in its objectives to strengthen the
national agricultural research program and to develop an extension service for
transmitting the research findings to the farm level.
2.27     Wadi Hiadramawt Developments.  The objective of WHAP I (Cr. 615-YDR -
1976 to 1982) was to stimulate increases in agricultural production on about
8,000 ha of irrigated land through the provision of extension units, inputs,
and feeder roads. Finance was included for a feasibility study on groundwater
resources and capacity for increasing irri_ated agriculture in Wadi
Hadramawt. The Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR - February 16, 1984)
concluded that "full benefits of the project would not be realized until the
completion of the Second Wadi Hadramawt Project." Progress of WHAP II



-8-
(Cr. 1346-YDR - effective date December 30, 1983) is generally good. Physical
developments are largely completed, with quantities and qualities at or better
than SAR plans: equipped tubewells, 56 (55 target); intensive irrigation
constructions for 3,360 ha (3,225 ha); spate renovation, 200 ha (200 ha);
established Agricultural Production Units (APU), 70 (55); and sprinkler
irrigation being installed, 62 ha (75 ha). Field extension services are
developing effectively and, although agricultural production is lagging (due
to delayed construction start-up, procurement of machinery and inadequate
inputs supplies), fa-.mers are participating enthusiastically and initial
production targets cf 93S cropping intensity are expected to be surpassed,
rising to 1101 within the period to prnject maturity. This credit is expected
to close on June 30, 1990.
2.28     In addition to direct project involvement, IDA has since 1975
developed an effective sector dialogue with Government. This sector work
focussed on evaluating past achievements, analyzing subsectors for which PDRY
has comparative advantages, and identifying physical and organizational
developments for better exploiting agricultural resources. This work included
detailed discussions on adjustments to policies and strategies to help
stimulate improved productivity while respecting the objectives on which
successive Five-Year Development Plans have been founded. An Agriculture
Sector Memorandum will be finalized in 1989.
2.29     Lessons Learned.  IDA's lending for agriculture has focussed on
developing approaches for harnessing irrigation resources, initiating research
and extension operations for expanding crop production and lifting
productivity, improving the supply and utilization of inputs, developing
institutions and training personnel. In most cases, developments are
continuing; however, the important lessons learned to date reflect the need
for: (a) security of tenure to encourage farmers to make long-term
investments in development and maintenance; (b) greater emphasis is required
for planning, operation and maintenance of irrigation works and for recovery
of costs from beneficiaries so as to ensure sustainability; (c) diversi-
fication and intensification of agricultural production is necessary for
justifying costs of irrigation and other inputs; (d) systematic reviews of
input/output prices and supports should be introduced in order to ensure
effective production incentives; (e) specific provisions are necessary for
minimizing bureaucratic d:lays in project start-up and procurement procedures;
and (f) progress monitoring for key aspects of development should be gi;en
priority. An action plan has been agreed with MAAR to rectify these
weaknesses prior to initiation of the proposed project.
2.30     In March 1989, floods (estimated probability occurrence of 1 in 50
years) hit the project area, damaging flood bunds (5,000 m), canals (4,500 m)
and land leveling. Subsequent inspection (5/89) by WHAP II cofinanciers
agreed on an action plan covering an engineering review of flood protection
works and rehabilitation for damaged structures. This work, which should be
completed by December 1989, will be executed jy the existing consultant and
contractor and will be financed from savings under KFAED/AFESD loans. This
experience showed that damage to crop production areas was less extensive than
would have occurred under the traditional irrigation system, thereby
validating the designs of project constructions. The further engineering
review will include proposals for structural adjustments and additional
fortifications to be incorporated into the proposed project, thereby
minimizing the risk of damage from future floods.

III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Physical Features
3.01     Location.  The project area is located in Wadi Hadramawt which lies
in the central part of PDRY in the Hadramawt Governorate (Map, IBRD 21479).
Flanked by 200 to 300 m high limestone cliffs 2 to 10 km apart, the Wadi
'iulley runs for about 120 km. The areas to be developed by the project are
distributed throughout the Wadi in the districts of Al Qat'n, Shibam, Seiyun
and Tarim. Seiyun, the project headquarters, is situated 500 km northeast of
Aden, and 200 km north of Mukalla, the port city and capital of the
Governorate.
3.02     The Climate of the project area is hot and dry, with mean monthly
daily temperature varying between 34°C in July to 20°C in December. Mean
annual pan evaporation measured at Seiyun is 3,000 mm/year. Relative humidity
ranges between 61% in January to 35X in June. Annual rainfall averages around
50 mm. Occasional dust storms and infrequent local hail storms occur.
3.03     Water resources mostly depend on groundwater; there are no perennial
rivers and the Wadi flows are erratic and unreliable. Assessment of surface
water resources, refined through a series of studies-L since 1980, provide a
clear picture of the regional water balance and recharge to the aquifers.
Groundwater supplies depend on three main aquifers. The most shallow aquifer
is saline to very saline in nature (EC 1.5 to 7.5 mmhos/cm).  The second
aquifer rests in a rather compact ccnglomerate layer, is low yielding and of
little economic importance.  The third aquifer is in Mukalla sandstone, which
is 300-400 m deep and has acceptable water quality (EC < 1.7 mmhos/cm).  Water
abstraction from the collection area has risen from about 20 Mm3/year in
1952 to an estimated 159 Mm3 in 1985 (Project Working Papers) and is
generally utilized inefficiently.  An estimated 111 Mm3 of water is pumped
annually from the shallow aquifer, including 21 Mm3 in the project area and
the saline water from this source has deleteriously affected soils in the area.
3.04     The final master water plan (4/88) resulting from the cumulative
investigations concluded that the total inflow to the aquifer (recharge,
boundary inflow and storage change) is 357 Mm3/year. The precise assessment
of groundwater resources of the Wadi Hadramawt area from the various studies,
including model predictions for both water levels and salinity forecasts,
showed that the interim planning assumptions for WHAP II development to be
overcautious and demonstrated that there is ample recharge capacity for
constructing additional deep wells to irrigate at least 3,000 ha. The
estimated drawdown in tie development areas after L0 years will average 15 m
for Phase II developments, allowing for an additional 3 to 6 m from annual
pumping of some 52 Mm3 for further developments included under the proposed
project. The quality of the sandstone aquifer is predicted to remain high.
3.05     Topography and Soils.  The topography of the valley plain slopes
1:1,000 north and 1:500 east. The micro relief is irregular with up to
1/ Coordinated reports issued by: SOGREAH (1981), USSR/Yemeni Project
(1981 & 1984), Binnie and Partners (1987), and Sir M. MacDonald & Partners
(1988).



-10-
2-3 m vertical intervals within 10 ha blocks. Consequently, land levelling is
necessary for furrow and basin irrigation. Soils are alluvial and range from
coarse-textured sandy soils to fine silt loams. In common with most hot arid
zones, these soils contain low organic matter and are calcareous with alkaline
reaction. Water holding and cation exchange capacities are also low and will
require more frequent irrigation and fertilization than higher clay content
soils. Overall drainage characteristics are good, while limiting factors are
micro relief and salinity.  The saline soils can be reclaimed by leaching
without serious difficulty at initial water application rates of 2,500 m /ha
to 15,000 m3/ha.
B. Population and Land Tenure
3.06     The population in Wadi Hadramawt is estimated at 225,000, or 22,000
families of about 10 persons. Some 560 families are benefitting from Phase II
developments and an estimated 620 farm units exist in the 17 areas pro2osed
for new groundwater-based development under the project. Together the
development would involve some 12,000 persons. Labor shortages are declining
in the Wadi Hadramawt area as Yemeni workers are returning from the Gulf
countries.
3.07     Land tenure in Wadi Hadramawt includes privately owned lands, the
cooperative-owned lands and state farms. The main land users are five
service-cum-production type cooperatives with a total cultivable area of
16,600 ha and nine state farms with a total area of 1,700 ha. The state farms
have a responsibility for producing selecteu crop seeds, but presently are
only producing some onion and wheat seed. Part of the Suwayri State Farm is
utilized for trials by the Seiyun Research Station. About 74Z of the area to
be affected by the project is covered by Al Qat'n (1,220 ha) and Seiyun
(1,040 ha) cooperatives, the remainder being part of the Shibam (605 ha) and
Tarim (160 ha) cooperatives.
3.08     Cooperative members are either beneficiaries of land reforms or
original small holders whose land was incorporated in the cooperatives of
which they became members. Both categories collaborate in Agricultural
Production Units (APU) which currently include an average of three families
who jointly operate a well and pump (about 10 1/sec) and associated irrigation
net-orks. On a family holding of 5.0 ha, only 2.5 ha is farmed annually
because of poor utilization of soils and water, shortage of inputs and labor
constraints in the absence of farm machinery. Farm work is divided within the
family. Women are generally involved with planting, weeding and harvesting
food crops and forage, as well as tending livestock, while men do land
cultivation, irrigation and crop treatment.
C. Rural Infrastructure
3.09     Communications.  Air transportation is maintained between Seiyun and
the rest of the country by flights most days to Aden and Mukalla. Good
overland transportation is by a blacktop paved road linking Seiyun to Mukalla
(220 km) and thence to Aden (600 km).  Within the Hadramawt Valley, a similar
main road links most urban centers from Tarim, in the east, and to Al Qat'n,
in the west. in addition, an 85 km network of feeder roads was built under
WHAP I and this network has beeii extended under WRAP II through the completion
of 27 km of farm roads.



-11-
3.10     Electric Power and Water Supplies.  Electric power supply source is
the central power plant of 4 x 4 MW capacity in Qaraw, constructed with IDA
support (Credit 829-YDR). Four substations of 33/11 KV and some 95 km of
33 KV and 647 km of 11 KV electric power lines serve settlemen-s and water
wells. Peak loads have increased to slightly more than 10 MW. The Public
Corporation for Electricity and Power (PCEP) is currently installing a fifth
6 MW generator. This will bring the operating capacity, with one stand-by
unit, to 16 MW. Allowing for future domestic demand increases at some 5X per
annum, it is estimated that this installed capacity will be adequate to meet
the power requirements of the total irrigation requirements under WHAP II and
the proposed Phase III developments, until 1991. Under its power development
plan, Government is comitted to add two further 6 MW-capacity generators *n
1991 and 1994; this would ensure the power demand for the project. An
assurance was obtained from Government at negotiations that PCEP would
continue to provide adequate power supply to operate the pumps on the
tubewells constructed under these projects throughout their life
[para. 7.02(b)].
3.11     At present 200 tubewells, about 2,000 open wells, 53 springs and a
number of small water reservoirs are used for the water supply in Wadi
Hadramawt. About 60% of the population has piped drinking water supply.
WHAP I assisted the Public Water Corporation with improvements of the water
supply systems at Shibam, Al Qat'n and 22 adjacent villages and, more
recently, a fiest-stage water supply scheme has been undertaken at Seiyun.
3.12     Education and Health.  The Wadi Hadramawt Valley has a good system
of primary schools. Education at the secondary and post-secondary level is
provided only at Seiyun. A .eacher's training college and a farm machinery
training institute are located at Seiyun (IDA Cr. 494-YDR). Schooling outside
the main wadi is less developed. There is a public hospital at Seiyun, with
health clinics located in the outer areas. A hospital has recently been built
at Al Arsamah in Wadi Duan with private funds. The available grains (wheat,
rice, sorghum), dates, sugar, fish, dairy products, fruit and vegetables
provide sufficient levels of calories; while it is estimated that intake of
animal proteins and vitamins are insufficient. This situation woulld improve
as a result of project developments due to the diversified production patterns.
D. Land Use, Agricultural Production and Services
Land Use and Agricultural Production
3.13     Land use follows two general patterns depending upon the source of
water. The first depends on seasonal rains and spate irrigation where sorghum
is grown, generally for forage but, when soil water suffices, for grain. The
only perennial crops grown under spate conditions are dates. Stone masonary
sills or dry rubble weirs have been constructed in most wadis, which raise the
water level and permit flooding or flow by channels to fields. Inside Wadis
Idim, Ain, Duan and Amd, which are lateral extensions cf Wadi Hadramawt, there
is an estimated 2,700 ha where reliable irrigation from spate di-rersions is
practiced every two or three years.
3.14     The second land use pattern depends on grourdwater pumping, mostly
shallow hand-dug wells equipped with electric and diesel-pumped vertical
turbines and centrifugal pumps. Approximately 75 deep boreholes exist in the
project area, of which 63 have been constructed under WHAP II. Developments



-12-
under WHAP II involve deeper boreholes (140-180 m) equipped with submersible
electric pumps. The extent of groundwater irrigation resources in the Wadi
Hadramawt area presently could command some 8,000 ha, of which about 6,250 ha
lie in the project area. Traditionally, water pumped from shallow wells is
conveyed to cultivated basins through earthen ditches. This involves up to
70% water losses due to poor layout and construction and inefficient water
management. Nearly half of the land remains fallow due to poor irrigation
technology, inadeqtate pumps and farm machinery, labor shortages, and lack of
incentives for farmers. The proposed project aims to rectify these
inefficiencies (paras. 4.12 and 4.16).
3.15    Agricultural production.  In addition to cereals, pulses and
vegetables, dates are an important traditional crop, and about 91 (275 ha) of
the area served by wells is in date palms.  In the areas selected for
groundwater irrigation development, there are three major farming systems:
two based on cereal cultivation and the third involving extensive date palm
plantations.  The two cereals systems, which occupy almost 80Z of the total
area, typically utilize about 50% of the cropped area for wheat, 20%-30% for
sorghum and the balance for alfalfa, sesame, and vegetables. Vegetable
production is mostly tomato, onion and garlic; and, in addition, potatoes have
been introduced recently. These two systems differ in cropping intensities
(ranging from 38% to 651) and in the relative proportions of the
labor-intensive, high-value crops. In the third system, which has a
relatively high cropping intensity (651), dates occupy some 172 of farm
areas. Land use patterns and yields and production of the main crops as
surveyed during project preparation are given in Table 3.1:

MRS for plowing and harrowing; (b) levelling and plotting of basins by hand



-13-
tool; and (c) manual sowing, planting, weeding and harvesting of all crops.
Farmers mainly tse their own seeds except for high-yielding wheat varietiea;
(Ahgat and Kalyansona, first introduced in mid-1970s and increasing steadily
in production area), and vegetables and seed potatoes which are mostly
imported from Europe by PCAS. Fertilizer applications of 100 kg urea plus
50 kg triple superphosphate per ha are reco mended for the project area.
However, these applications are not generally being achieved in WHAP II areas
due to shortage of supplies. Pest control, although uncommon, is increasing.
Under the proposed project, crop production technologies would be modernized
and intensified (para. 6.04).
3.17     A sample survey in the project area indicates that a typical family
owns 11 sheep and 17 goats, while the total livestock population of the area
includes some 30,000 sheep and goats together with some donkeys and a small
number of cattle and camels. Livestock normally graze crop residues (mostly
sorghum stover and straw) or rough grazing supplemented with green alfalfa.
Underfeeding was traditionally common due to the shortage of supply and
prohibitive.y high prices for alfalfa; but this situation is now improving as
a result of expansion in forage production.
Ariculturl Cooperatives and Credit
3.18     There are four district-based production and services cooperatives
serving the project area (Al Qat'n, Shibam, Seiyun and Tarim). Particulars of
each cooperative and its financial position are given in Annex 1, Tables 1 and
2, respectively. They have a total membership of 3,187 and are typically
operated by a manager with four administrative sections involving a staff of
between 30 and 50. Each cooperative has an elected management committee
including farmers' representatives. The physical facilities of each
cooperative include office buildings, storage, vehicles and limited quantities
of farm machinery. In addition to production and marketing services, these
cooperatives obtain seasonal and long-term credit on behalf of farmers from
NBY. The cooperatives operate suboptimaliy due to untrained managers, poor
business organization and overstaffing. Nonetheless, all four are profitable
(profit to income averaging 27% in 1986 and 1987) and financially sound
(estimated total asset value and liquidity equivalent to US$1.0 million and
US$1.5 million, respectively). Training provisions under the proposed project
would help to strengthen standards of operation and management (para. 5.11);
this would be important in view of increasing demand for services and
organizational support and possible decline in earnings which may arise as a
result of liberalization of produce marketing (para. 6.12).
Agricultural Supporting Services
3.19     There are five main agricultural institutions in Wadi Hadramawt,
Seiyun Agriculture Research Certer, Seiyun Agriculture Extension and Training
Service, Seiyun Machine Rental Service, Seivun PCAS branch, and Seiyun branch
of the PCMFV. The first two work directly together to investigate,
demonstrate and extend appropriate crop production technologies. The second
two supply inputs and land preparation services to farmers through their
district cooperative. The fifth is responsible for buying fruit and
vegetables from cooperatives and for wholesale/retail onselling.
3.20     Agriculture Research.  The Seiyun Agriculture Research Station
includes seven sections: agronomy, plant protection, soils, horticulture,



-14-
forestry, production economics and mechanization. The station's 20 ha
experimental farm is located at Suwayri, 30 km from Seiyun. Under che
IDA-assisted Agricultural Research & Extension (R&E) Project, the research
program has been reorganized with multidisciplinary research teams and
extension-research coordinators (outreach). Research programs are designed by
the station's research council in collaboration with the extension service and
are approved at regional level. Research efforts have mainly focussed on
variety screening and breeding work for wheat, sorghum, onions, tomatoes,
potatoes and cowpeas; weed control, mainly in wheat, potatoes and onions;
investigations into the economics of land preparation; and agronomy of wheat,
onions and potatoes. The station also produces basic seeds, mainly of wheat
and onions. Research priorities which need to be introduced urgently are:
irrigation agronomy, farm mechanization and fruit crop production. On-farm
verification trials of different kinds are being run in collaboration with the
field extension service.
3.21     Agricultural Extension.  The present extension unit at Seiyun
consists of one head, two deputy heads (one for extension and the other for
communication and training), three subject-matter specialists, twenty field
extension agents/technical assistants (FEA/TA), of whcm 16 operate in the
general project area and two are supervisory posts (currently vacant). Each
FEA and TA is attached to & specific cooperative and covers about 340
farmers. A T&V system is being develuped for extension operations and,
although its implementation and R&E outreach need further strengthening,
particularly through provision of Subject Matter Specialists (SMSs) in
specific enterprises, field extension work is having a positive impact.
Vehicles and equipment pro'iided under WIiAP II are contributing significantly
to this development. Both research and extension operations for the new
development areas would be enhanced under the proposed project.
3.22     The Machinery Rental Service in Wadi Hadramawt employs 339 personnel,
including 145 tractor drivers, and operates 35 bulldozers and 90, wheel
tractors, of which some 18 are under control of the individual cooperatives.
The wheel tractors are up to 16 years old and reportedly function 1800
hours/year. Land preparation in the project area is protracted hecause of
limited tractor capacity and poor scheduling of operations. This is now being
remedied under WHAP II by purchasing tractors and assigning farm equipment
directly to APUs, improving cultivation techniques, e.g., using some larger
tractors and more shallow tillage, extending cropping patterns, and arranging
better coordination by cooperatives. Sixty-seven tractors ond equipment have
been imported under WHAP II, thereby creating the basis for decentralized farm
mechanization (para. 2.18).
3.23     The PCAS branch in Seiyun was opened in 1983.  Present storage
capacity is only 100 tons and a new structure is beir.g built. However, the
delays encountered in transporting inputs directly from Aden to the
cooperatives immediately prior to the cultivEtion season would best be
overcome by decentralizing storage to the cooperatives (para. 5.13). PCMFV
has a 500-ton cold storage facility at Seiyun which, properly organized, can
provide adequate facilities for storing perishables in the area for the
foreseeable future (para. 6.12). DAW. There is a livestock department and
veterinary center located at Seiyun and four veterinary sections in the
project area. However, eespite being adequately staffed, livestock services
are restricted by lack of budget resources for equipment and drugs. A sheep
and goat development project, which is being funded by the UNCDF and UNDP,



-15-
will help to rectify this situation by piloting sheep and goat development,
related research, extension training, animal health and nutrition in Wadi
Hadramawt.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project
4.01     The Third Development Plan focusses on expanding production and
improving food self-sufficiency through better utilization of scarce na;ural
resources. In this context, Wadi Hadramawt, which has good soils base and
significant untapped water, can make a major cnntribution. Tha existing
cropping intensity of 50X, in the traditional areas dependent on the shallow
aquifer, can only be improved through access to the more reliable and good
quality water from the deep, sandstone aquifer. Furthermore, these farmers
risk salinizing soils and depressing crop yields by continued utilization of
water from the shallow aquifer.
4.02     The proposed project would, therefore, provide a vehicle for
developing and expanding production on some 3,025 ha of traditionally
irrigated lands and for consolidating development on 3,225 ha included in
WHAP II. In addition, it would support adjustments in agriculture policies
and strategies which would further enhance sustainable development in Wadi
Hadramawt.
4.03     The approach to the new irrigation development would be based on the
traditional experience of APUs centered on sharing of water wells. However,
in order to inteasify land use, the project would follow the innovative design
which has been successfully .mplemented under WHAP II, and which involves the
;         drilling of one tubewell with 50 1/sec (50 ha) capacity and the associated
constructior, of a canal or pipe distributio. network. Thus, APUs of
approximately 50 ha would UR developed to form the organizational unit within
the cooperative Doth for water management and farm machinery operations. The
irrigation layout would be designed to divide a farm unit into two equal
areas, each to be farmed by an Agricultural Production Group (APG). The
agricultural research and extension operations, already in place, would be
strengthened and expanded to develop and transfer farm level technology needed
to achieve the project's agricultural production objectives. Details of
revised regulations contained in the final legislative proposals pertaining to
the long-term use or ownership of land and trees by farmers in the project
area and the associated formal certification (para. 2.12) were scrutinized at
negotiations and found satisfactory; ,he certificates are expected to be
distributed to farmers by January 1990.
B. Project Objectives
4.04      Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the project would be to
consolidate and expand developments in Wadi Hadramawt so as to ensure
sustainable agricultural production and to improve the income and living
standards of project beneficiaries, while paying attention to conserving the
environment. This would be achieved through: (a) consolidating developments
in the Phase II areas; (b) providing dependable irrigation water supplies
through tube-ll development to about 3,025 ha in 17 additional areas which
are mostly contiguous with areas developed under Phase II; (c) improving works



-16-
for spate irrigation for 2,700 ha; (d) providing incremental inputs required
to raise the level of crop production in the total project area (6,250 ha) to
1301; (e) expanding agricultural research and extension services; (f) estab-
lishing an Irrigation Maintenance Unit (IMU) in Wadi Hadramaw*; and (g) provid-
ing training and technical assistance personnel for developing irrigation
systems and for improving agricultural productivity.
4.05     Simmary Description of Proiect Components.  lhe project would include
the following components:
(a) developing groundwater irrigation on about 3,025 ha through
construction of deep wells, development of irrigation networks and
on-farm works, including land levelling;
(b) rehabilitating traditional spaLe irrigation works and provision of
flood protection works;
(c) expanding and consolidating agricultural production oni about 6,250 ha
through supply of farm machinery, provision of improved inputs,
development of seed production, support for expanding orchard and
honey production, and strengthening of research and extension
services;
(d) providing engineering and administrative support by maintaining and
strengthening the existing Project Management Unit (PMU) and
providing technical assistance and training; and
(e) establishing and equipping an Irrigation Maintenance Unit (IMU).
C. Detaied Project Features
Irrigation Development (Base Cost US$18.85 million)
4.06     Design Aspects.  Seventeen new development areas have been selected
on the basis of availability of suitable soils, proximity to potential
tubewell sites and electric power lines, and for the interest of loc 1 farmers
for participating in project developments. The basic design unit would be the
50 ha APU as successfully tested under WHAP II. The proposed project would
differ from the Phase II project appraisal design in five main respects:
(a) the design cropping intensity would be increased to about 130% instead oE
93X; (b) the provision of a pipe distribution system with no land levelling
instead of an open canal system in areas subject to flooding (450 ha); (c) the
reduction in the size of irrigation basins; (d) the provision of a more
appropriate tractor and set of implements for each APU; and (e) the
implementation of an IMU. These modifications aim at containing project
costs, ensurinig long-term sustainability of irrigation infrastructure,
inducing greater autonomy of agricultural operations, and raising farm
profitability in the project area.
4.07     The calibrated mathematical model developed to evaluate groundwater
resources in the area confirmed the optimum number of tubewells to be
developed and indicated their location. The nominal design discharge of
tubewells would be 50 1/sec, compared to the wells of 20 to 30 1/sec capacity
installed prior to 1983. This has resulted from the experience in Phase II,
where well yields were higher than expected, with the result that most new



-17-
wells drilled and completed have an average discharge of 55 1/sec. The
increase in design capacity is also supported on economic grounds. Tubewells
would be locate4 as near to the edge of the valley as possible, so as to
minimize depth to the sandstone aquifer and to better ensure acceptable water
quality (EC < 2 mmhos/cm).
4.08     The design of the proposed new irrigation works has evolved from the
experience gained under Wadi Hadramawt II and is more economical than the
design used for the WRAP I demonstration areas and the Soviet-Yemeni design
for state farms. Possibilities for achieving cost reduction in Phase II
designs have been considered and, in general, the use of alternative
irrigation methods, such as sprinkler or drip, are not feasible on a large
scale at the current stage of development in the valley (although they might
prove the optimum solution on APUs where large volumes of soil would require
to be moved). Generally, a PVC conveyance pipeline would connect each
tubewell to the head of a 50 ha unit. A division box would share the
discharge equally between two subunits (APG) of 25 ha each, leading to a
network of lined and unlined canals or pipelines. The design of irrigation
networks would generally follow the criteria established for WHAP II.
4.09     Irrigation Water Supply (Base Cost US$7.24 million).  To provide
irrigation wrter supply, the project would install 59 new tubewells as shown
by area in Annex 2, Table 1. This includes replacing 14 dilapidated boreholes
by 7 fully equipped units, for which three have already established adequate
distribution structures. The new tubewells would have an average depth of
170 m (range 155 m to 205 m).  Boreholes of up to 17-3/8 inches would be
drilled using drilling method approved by the project consultants. As the
sandstone aquifer has good water quality, mild steel casing and scieen would
be installed; this would also facilitate maintenance. A graded gravel pack
would be placed around screens and the boreholes would be equipped with
submerged vertical electropumping units suitable for continuous operation and
ranging in size from 30 kw to 45 kw, a total of 66 units, including standby
sets (Annex 2, Table 2). Power supply to tubewells would be provided by PCEP
through a total of 31 km of 11 kv cables, tapping on to the high voltage lines
already existing in the area. Each well would also have a pumphouse.
4.10     The design and construction of tubewells and the technical
specifications for pumpsets, including testing and installation, would be
generally consistent with the standards established under WHAP II. These
works would be carried out by competent design consultants and engineering
contractors (para. 4.37).
4.11     Irrigation Networks (Base Lost US$7.39 million).  Provision would be
made for the construction of some 65 km of conveyance pipelines, 59 km of
lined and 116 km of unlined canals, 22 km of pipe distributior networks and
(3,525 No.) associated structures. These quantities have been assessed from
the 1:10,000 scale semi-detailed designs prepared by the WHAP II study teams.
The lined canals would be built by forming a compacted embankment from which
the channel shape would be cut. The design and construction standards for
irrigation works would generally follow the criteria and specifications
established for WHAP II. Exceptions to this would be: (a) the designs of
structures would be specifically reviewed by the engineering consultants to
determine the validity for replacing open canals by pipe networks, so as to
economize on costs wherever possible; and (b) the technical specifications
would be more flexible, so as to ailow potential contractors to tender for



-18-
both lined canals or equivalent capacity buried pipes, and also for lined
canals to be made from 2 m or 3 m wide compacted embankments.
4.12     On-farm Improvements (Base Cost US$3.00 million).  The project would
finance 2,125 ha of land improvement works, comprising: land levelling,
rearrangement of field sizes to permit efficient mechanization, at the same
time as economizing on earth movement and increasing irrigation efficiency.
To improve water management and irrigation scheduling, a small number of
neutron probes and, on a trial basis, infrared thermometers, would be
provided. These instruments would be used by the extension service in
.armers' fields to continually monitor soil moisture content during the
growing seasons. Training and back-up service would be provided by equipment
suppliers and through collaboration with ICAADA's Farm Resource Management
Program. In addition, the project would provide for construction of 60 farm
sheds and 24 km of gravel-surfaced farm roads which would connect most of the
project locations with the Al Qat'n - Tarim road. The latter would facilitate
movement of inputs and produce, and O&M activities.
4.13     Other Works (Base Costs US$0.31 million).  The project would finance
16 km of flood bunds to protect a limited number of project areas from spate
flows in the main Wadi. Design and construction of these works would be
consistent with existing criteria and specifications of MAAR, which are
satisfactory to IDA.
4.14     Spate Improvement Works (Base Cost US$0.91 million).  This component
would aim at keeping operational, at a minimum cost, an irrigation technique
that has the advantage of providing additional water for crops, recharging the
aquifer and stabilizing the beds of the wadis. Some of the sills and weirs
damaged by floodls in 1982 have been rehabilitated under WHAP II. Preparation
studies have covered the rehabilitation requirements of some 26 additional
structures in the tributary wadis of Idim, Duan, Ain and Amd, together with
two small flood protection works in the main valley near population centers.
In view of the possilYlity that exact requirements of rehabilitation may
change during the project implementation, a flexible program approach would be
more suitable for this component.
4.15     Seven spate schemes are planned for rehabilitation to provide
improved irrigation for some 2,700 ha. Quantities of works, as shown in
Annex 2, Table 3, are based on experience under Phase II and model designs
already prepared in detail. All civil works designs and construction would be
in accordance with existing criteria and specifications of MAAR for such
works, which are satisfactory to IDA.
Agricultural Development (Base Cost of US$9.04 million)
4.16     Research and Extension (Base Cost US$1.28 million).  Existing
research and extension services would be ougmented under the project to
support the increases in crcpping intensity, production and the expansion in
development area. For research, additional scientists would be recruited to
initiate trials on irrigation agronomy, farm mechanization and fruit crop
production. For extension, additional SMSs would be recruited to evolve
programs for important aspects of production in the project area (irrigation
agronomy, livestock production, date production, women's extension, and farm
mechanization). Six additional FEAs would be recruited to serve the new
development areas. Some 120 man-months (mm) of training would be provided for



-19-
R&E personnel, half being overseas. Staff mobility and effectiveness for the
two services would be improved through the provision of 5 4-WD vehicles or
pickups and 20 motorcycles. Office furniture and equipment would be provided
for research and field extension activities, as well as expendable research
materials and scientific publications. Special provision would be made for
expanding research in potato seed and for production of onion seed for project
farmers.
4.17     Rehabilitation of the date palms, covering approximately 275 ha,
would be an integral part of the field extension service, especially in Seiyun
area. This would involve demonstrating technology for the removal of
nonproductive suckers from palms, the thinning and rearrangement of palm trees
in rows, varietal improvement for new plantings and improved irrigation and
fertilization. Farmers' reception to date rehabilitation during WHAP II has
been slow; but, now that the ownership issue is resolved, interest is expected
to be revived and the project would provide extension advice, inputs and
equipment, like ladders and hand tools, for date producers.
4.18     Tree Nursery (Base Cost US$0.55 million).  The Project would expand
the promotion of fruit orchards commenced under WHAP II. In particular, it
would provide for the further development of a fruit tree and date palm
nursery to be established under WHAP II at Shuhuh some 4 km west of Seiyun.
It is expected that the WHAP II staff would commence operations of planting
local rootstock for subsequent grafting of local budwood stock (and
possibility of further improvement from imported resistant rootstock in
future).  Seedlings of Zizyphus spina-christi, a xerophytic shrub which is the
source for the nectar for the famous honey produced in Wadi Hadramawt, would
also be propagated. Annual sales from the nursery would expand to 15,000
grafted seedlings in the second year of project iwplementation (PY2), which
would be sufficient for 60 ha of orchard, plus 10,000 Zizyphus seedlings.
4.19     The project would provide a replacement lorry, a station wagon, 2
motorcycles, a standby electric pump of 12-15 hp size, and shading material.
A technical assistant horticulturalist, to be recruited for 18 months, would
have special experience in nursery management. Recurrent Losts would ir lude
staff salaries (one graduate staff, one technician and 4 pump operators/labor,
each for six years) and consumable supplies.
4.20     Agricultural Machinery' and Machinery Rental Service (Base Costs
US$5.00 million). Farm mechanization under the project would cover all
aspects of crop production, including primary tillage, precision operations
for planting or sowing, fertilizing and spraying, and threshing and winnowing,
potato lifting, forage cutt.ng, and haulage. Agricultural machinery would be
provided for project farmers to improve farming efficiency to about 1302
cropping intensity. Investments would include 60 medium power (65 hp)
tractors and 4 of larger capacity (92 hp) for heavier land work. The
agricultural machinery and equipment proposed for the project areas are
presented in Annex 3, Table 1. Specific organization and operation
arrangements would apply to all farm machinery (para. 5.15).
4.21     MRS would play an important role in modernizing cultivation practices
in the project area to intensive mechanization systems. MRS activities would
he adjusted from provision of cultivation services to provision, through
cooperatives, of back-up assistance for training and machinery maintenance and
repairs. In order to support this transition, project financing would be



-20-
provided to MRS for modernizing and stresmlining its servicing and storage
facilities and for establishing a mobile workshop unit. At negotiations,
terms of reference were discussed and assurances were obtained from Government
that review and reorganization of MRS would be implemented by June 30, 1990,
after consultation with IDA [para. 7.02(c)].
4.22     Input Supboly (Base Cost US$ 2.21 million).  The Project would provide
the incremental production inputs required for expanding the development area
and increasing cropping intensities in Wadi Hadramawt. Supply of inputs would
be made for the project years 3 to 5. It would also provide the estimated
incremental requirements of inputs for increasing cropping intensities in
WRAP II areas. Estimated quantities are summarized in Annex 3, Table 2.
4.23     The arrangements agreed upon under Phase II whereby farmers would be
charged an interest rate of 7-1/2% per annum on all inputs to be made
available on credit under the project have not functioned in practice.
Farmers' reluctance has led the concerned cooperatives to refuse to pay
interest at this level and, therefore, no inputs have been procured through
the project. In late 1988, Ministries of Planning and Finance and MAAR
finally agreed to charge interest on credit supplied to Wadi Hadramawt farmers
at 5-1/21 per annum. Although lower than originally agreed, in the light of
current inflation rates (estimated 21 per annum), this rate is positive in
real terms and is consistent with the prevailing interest rate in the
country. Furthermore, NBY reports that there is no default on loans paid
through the project cooperatives, and NBY's administrative costs are fully
covered by 2-1/2% equivalent interest charge. The project would provide no
direct assistance for credit. However, at negotiations, assurances were
obtained from Government that interest rates for agricultural credit will be
reviewed, by December 1, annually to ensure that they continue to be positive
in real terms [para. 7.02(d)].
Project Management (Base Cost US$3.91 million)
4.24     Project Management Unit (US$1.09 million).  The existing PMU is
efficiently implementing WHAP II and there is no need to change its structure
or organization (Chart 1, pages 1-2). Project costs would provide for the
continuation of the PMU throughout the project implementation period, related
office management and O&M of vehicles for performing various project
implementation functions. The project would also finance procurement of four
4-WD station wagons, two 4-WD double cabin pickups, six motor cycles and some
items of office equipment.
4.25     Technical Assistance and Training (US$2.82 million).  The following
technical assistance would be provided to the PM¶U: one irrigation engineer to
assist PM in coordination of civil works construction, the evolution of
procedures for O&M and cost recovery and for procurement of goods, plus one
irrigation agronomist and one horticulturalist to assist in evolving
appropriate technological packages for intensifying agricultural production
and in developing sustainable research/extension and training procedures.
Specialist technical consultancies would include farm machinery, monitoring
and evaluation, integrated pest management, animal production and agricultural
economics. A total of 156 man-months of short-term overseas/local training
would be included for the project staff and project-related studies. In
addition, and following the practice adhered to for WHAP II, the project would
finance consulting engineers' services for the final planning, and design and
the construction supervision of tubewells, irrigation networks and on-farm
development works.

-21-
ITigation Maintenance ULit (Base Cost US$2.37 million)
4.26     The project would help establish an Irrigation Maintenance Unit(IMU)
at Seiyun within PMU for coordinating and supervising the O&M of both
traditional spate and modern irrigation systems. It would be a functional
unit responsible for planning, monitoring and budgeting and for advising
farmers/cooperatives on normal maintenance. In addition, it would execute
special or emergency repairs. The IMU would arrange execution of earthworks
in collabora.ion with MRS, and other works through force account with farmers'
participation and, ideally, for the long term, with 1,cal contractors.
4.27     The project would finance a complete range of earthmoving equipment,
vehicles, instruments and office equipment, as well as necessary materials,
equipment, 24 man-months of overseas train4ng and minimum necessary
maintenance equipment. A list of maintenance equipment and vehicles to be
purchased under the project for the IMU is given in Annex 3, Table 3. In
addition, financing would be provided (PY2 through PY6) for a complete team of
personnel for establishing IMU, including surveyors, engineers and
administrators, as well as support staff. The IMU would be financed from
maintenance charges supplemented by the fiscal budget.
D. Other Features of the Project
4.28     Status of Project Preparation.  Existing studies consisted of:
(a) semi-detailed designs at 1:10,000 scale of the project groundwater
development areas; (b) preparation of detailed bills of quantities for each of
the 17 new development areas; (c) detailed design of spate rehabilitation
works commanding some 2,700 ha and identification of some 20 other sites; and
(d) review and updating of cost estimates for civil works. In order to ensure
a rapid take-off, timely preparatory work and early implementation, MAAR
intends to extend the services of the existing irrigation engineering advisor,
while the preparation of final tender designs should be arranged through
consulting engineers. Government intends to finance these start-up activities
through credit funds for studies remaining under WHAP II. Tender documents
established under WHAP II for tubewell drilling, pump units and other civil
works have been modified by PMU to obtain proposals and to enable award of
contracts during PYI (para. 5.12).
4.29     The draft tender documents were approved at negotiations for both the
design engineering consultants and for the contractors. Similarly, terms of
reference for technical assistance personnel and project studies were reviewed
and agreed upon at negotiations (para. 4.37).
4.30     Environmental Impact.  Proposed project developments would have no
direct or indirect detrimental effect on known archaeological or historical
sites. The site of Shibam town, a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site, is
situated five miles from the closest area of project activity. The irrigation
flood bunds and spate irrigation structures would have a conservation eflect
by reducing erosion, controlling floods and helping to recharge the aquifers.
The incidence of saline water being pumped from some shallow wells would be
reversed by replacing these facilities by deep wells from the 200 m aquifer
which provides good quality water. In addition, the existing water monitoring
unit (WMU) in PMU would be enlarged to ensure thorough quantitative and
qualitative measurements on groundwater abstraction and recharge and spate
flows. The new development would involve 2,125 ha of land leveling which,
together with precise technical messages by the extension service, would help



-22-
to prevent over-irrigation and avoid any salinity hazard. As all water
resources in the project area involve seasonal spate Lioods or groundwater,
the incidence of schistosomiasis or other water borne ailments is
insignificant. Furthermore, the design and operation of irrigation system
(axiuum 21 hours a day) would prevent vector habitat for schistosomiasis.
4.31     The Seiyun Research Station would provide improved technology
packages for crop production which would limit the application levels of
inorganic chemicals, combined with organic manure and compost. Following
existing practice, technical packages to be transferred to farmers by
extension agents would emphasize appropriate application rates for all
fertilizers, pesticides or other chemicals. Furthermore, project investments
would provide for the construction of store sheds on all APUs, which would
enable the secure storage of all agricultural chemicals. The development of
more diversified cropping rotations would serve to improve soil structure and
prevent build-up of disease and pests, while encouraging improvements in
nutrient levels. Project actions would lead to improvements in human health
and nutrition as a result of better quality drinking water and improved diets
involving more diverse crops and a more continuous supply throughout the year,
particularly for vegetables and fruits.
4.32     A list of admissible agricultural chemicals was approved at
negotiations and will be reviewed annually as part of the work program/budget
review throughout project implementation, to ensure that only low toxicity and
adequately degradable chemicals are applied. A short-term consultant would be
employed to deve,op a plan for crop protection research and to prepare for the
gradual introduction of a strategy for integrated pest management. In
addition, all agricultural chemicals proposed for procurement under the
project would be reviewed by IDA environmental staff.
4.33     On the negative side, with increased mechanization, there would be
increasing risk of injury from farm machinery. Safeguards against accidents
would be provided by the appointment of an SMS for farm mechanization and
special training for personnei of FEAs and cooperatives. Hazards associated
with pesticides would also be avDided by ensuring that trained extension
workers would supervise the spraving of insecticides and herbicides.
E. Cost Estimates
4.34     Total project costs are estimated at about US$41.8 million
(YD 14.3 million), including US$2.7 million (YD 0.9 million) for physical
contingencies and US$4.9 million (YD 1.7 million) for price contingencies.
Goods and services procured under IDA-assisted projects in PDRY are exempted
from import taxes and duties. Total foreign exchange costs are estimated at
US$30.6 million (YD 10.5 million) or 73Z of total cost. The foreign exchange
estimate assumes that foreign contractors would win contracts for irrigation
development works and for furnishing the associated equipment. The cost
estimates for civil works, equipment, vehicles and inputs are based on unit
prices experienced under WHAP II or from recent contracts issued for similar
items in PDRY, and on quotations from suppliers, appropriately adjusted to
mid-1989 baseline price levels. The costs for technical assistance
specialists, consultants services and local and overseas training are based on
the prevailing rates in the country. Physical contingencies have been allowed
on the baseline costs, equivalent to 152 for spate and road developments, 102
for irrigation works and 52 for all other expenditures excepting studies.
Price contingencies are based orn increases in local costs of 3% per annum in



-23-
PYI and 2, rising to 3.5S per annum thereafter, and in foreign exchange costs
of 4.21 in PYI and 4.41 per annum thereafter. Cost estimates for the proposed
project  are  summarized  in  Table  4.1  and  detailed  in  Annex  4,  Tables  1 to  3.

F. Financing Plan
4.35         Financing.  An IDA credit of US$12.0 million equivalent
(YD 4.1 million), on standard terms, would finance about 391 of the project's
foreign exchange, or 291 of total project costs. AFESD and KFAED would
jointly finance the remainder of the foreign exchange costs, amounting to
about US$18.6 million (YD 6.3 million), and specific items of incremental
local expenditures amounting to about US$1.8 million (YD 0.6 million). At
Government's request, these organizations are expected to complete their own
appraisal by September 1989. Table 4.2 summarizes the financing plan for the
project. Cofinancing would be by parallel arrangements and a detailed plan by
agency as well as by component was finalized at negotiations. A condition
for declaring credit effectiveness would be the signing of loan/credit
agreements with cofinanciers for the project [para. 7.01(a)].

4.36     The Borrower of the IDA Credit would be PDRY which, through MAAR and
DOI, will utilize the funds in accordance with the terms and conditions set
forth in the Development Credit Agreement.
G. Procurement
4.37     Procurement for all items under the project, except farm inputs,
would be carried out by the PMU through the DOI. Farm inputs would be
procured as part of PCAS's bulk purchase, in accordance with IDA guidelines.
The required civil works for tubewell irrigation and spate development, as
well as some machinery, totalling US$19.3 million, would be financed by KFAED
and AFESD using international competitive bidding (ICB) and other procurement
procedures similar to those of IDA. Vehicles, machinery, equipment, and farm
inputs totalling US$8.5 million would be financed by IDA and procured through
ICB procedures according to IDA guidelines. Local manufacturers would be
allowed a 15Z preference margin, or the actual customs duty to nonexempt
importers, whichever is lower, on ICB goods contracts financed by IDA. During
the project implementation period, spare parts amounting to about US$1.6
million (of which, IDA:   US$1.0 million) would be required for repair and
maintenance of vehicles, machinery and equipment and would be procured from
the original manufacturers by direct contracting. At negotiations, PDRY
confirmed that:  (i) the agricultural specialists and overseas training
(para. 4.25) to be financed by IDA (US$1.9 million) would be procured, as in
the ongoing project, probably through a contract with the FAO Trust Fund,
satisfactory to IDA [para. 7.02(e)]; (ii) vehicles, machinery and equipment
would be procured on a timely schedule and in accordance with IDA Procurement
Guidelines [para. 7.02(f)]; and (iii) consulting engineering services
(para. 4.10) to be financed by the other donors, would be retained under
terms, conditions and schedules satisfactory to IDA Lpara. 7.02(g)].
4.38     Minor items of equipment and materials (cement, pipes, etc.) for
field operations are not suited for ICB. These items, estimated to cost less
than US$50,000 each contract, and amounting to not more than US$0.6 million,
would be procured following prudent shopping procedures based on comparing
price quotations from at least three suppliers.
4.39     All bidding packages for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of
US$100,000 or more would be subject to prior IDA review of procurement
documentation, as would the final award of the related contracts. These
arrangements would result in a coverage of about 85Z value of the contracts.
The balance of contracts would be subject to random postreview by IDA
personnel during supervision missions.
4.40     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government on the
overall procurement procedures for the project, and agreements were reached on
the draft terms of reference for consulting engineers and technical assistance
personnel, and on the draft bid documents for civil works, vehicles, machinery
and equipment. The procurement arrangements to be followed for the project,
including components to be financed by IDA, are summarized in Table 4.3.

4.41     The PDRY central procurement procedures have caused delays in
implementing ongoing IDA-financed projects.  In order to avoid delays under
the proposed project, a detailed schedule of procurement for works, goods and
services has been prepared for the proposed project and IDA, MAAR and the
Central Coordination and Steering Committee (CCSC) (para. 5.06) would closely
monitor procurements. To aid this process, a MAAR administrator is being
assigned and would be trained by an IDA expert to take specific responsibility
for ensuring that procurements from the IDA credit comply with the Guidelines.
H. Disbursements
4.42     Disbursement categories, credit amounts to be allocated and the share
of expenditures to be financed by IDA would be as summarized in Table 4.4:

4.43     The proposed IDA credit has been estimated to be disbursed over seven
years. This is shorter than the country historical sectoral average of eight
years but is in line with the achievements of and benefits from the experience
under WHAP II and was confirmed at negotiations. Disbursements would be made
after receipt of full documentation, except in the case of goods and services
provided under contracts of a value of less than US$100,000 equivalent for
which disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)
certified by MAAP. The latter would retain the supporting documentation and
make it available for inspection during IDA review missions and by external
auditors. The estimated schedule of disbursements is summarized in Table 4.5
below (detailed in Annex 4, Table 4).

4.44     Special Account.  Provision has been made ror PDRY to open and
maintain a US$0.7 million Special Account for funding the items to be financed
by IDA.  The IDA financing would be channelled through NBY.  Deposits into anid
payments out of the Special Account would be made on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA. While withdrawals from the proceeds of the proposed
credit may be handled through the Special Account, IDA would continue to
accept, in appropriate cases, withdrawal applications in amounts exceeding
3 ' 6 ' C t i I . . 9



-27-
US$50,000 for direct payment and agreements to reimburse. A similar account
has been efficiently operated under WHAP II and, at negotiations, assurance
was obtained from Government concerning the operation of the Special Account
(para. 7.02(h)].
L Auditing and Accounts
4.45     All organizations involved in project implementation would be subject
to Government of PDRY expenditure control and auditing procedures, which are
considered satisfactory. Project accounts would be maintained separately, and
in a readily identifiable form, by the PMU, PCAS, R&E Department and the
Cooperatives. Project accounts will be consolidated by the Permanent
Secretariat of the CCSC to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting
practices, the operations, resources and expenditures related to the project.
The Central Board of Auditing (CBA)--an independent auditing agency--would
continue to audit project accounts of concerned organizations on a timely
basis. The recent audit reports prepared by CBA with respect to the ongoing
IDA-financed agricultural projects (Cr. 1145-YDR, 1346-YDR and i557-YAR) have
been favorably received by IDA. At negotiations, assurances were obtained
from Government and MAAR on the above accounting and auditing procedures, and
that: (a) certified copies of the audited accounts of the project and Special
Account for each fiscal year audited, and of the auditors' report would be
furnished to IDA not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year,
and (b) the auditors' report would be of such scope and in such detail as IDA
shall reasonably request, including, inter alia, a statement that the funds
advanced by IDA for the Special Account and disbursed against SOEs had been
used for the purposes for which they were provided [para. 7.02(i)(ii)].
V. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management
5.01     General.  The proposed project would be implemented through existing
institutions, so as to profit from experience under past projects and to
strengthen their performance and collaborat'un and, thereby, to ensure
efficient project execution. Following the arrangements for WHAP II, MAAR
would have overall responsibility for project implementation through its DOI.
The Ministries of Planning and Finance would participate in the scrutiny and
approval of the project's annual work programs and budgets. The existing
national staff of the Phase II PMU, as well as the office and housing
facilities, would be maintained. Government has confirmed that the existing
competent PMU would continue under the proposed project, with full
responsibility for planning, coordinating and supervising operations. The PMU
would be responsible for preparing annual work programs and budgets,
coordinating all aspects of project implementat;an and monitoring progress.
At n_gotiations, assurances were obtained that, after review and confirmation
by the CCSC, a copy of the annual work program, budget and finance plan for
the project would be forwarded to IDA by November 15 of the preceding year for
review and comment (para. 7.02(i)(i)].
5.02     Continuing the practice of WHAP II, the PMU would be headed by a
national Project Manager (PM) who would be responsible to the Deputy Minister
MAAR through the Director General, DOI. The selection of the PM and the
technical assistance experts would be done in consultation with IDA; it is
intended that the PM for WHAPII, who is fully satisfactory, will be retained



-28-
in post. The PMU is organized in six sections: administration and finance;
planning; design and construction supervision; agricultural development; M&E;
and Water Monitoring Unit (WMU) for hydrological/hydrogeological monitoring
(para. 5.23). The TA specialists would all be responsible to the PM.
Proposed staffing for the PMU is shown in Annex 5, Table l. Terms of
reference for key posts in PMU were agreed upon at negotiations wher
assurances were obtained from Government concerning the recruitment and
maintenance in posts of qualified personnel for the PMU [para. 7.02(j)].
5.03     The PMU would also be responsible for the preparation of technical
specifications and contract documents for civil engineering works to be
executed and for all items (except inputs) to be procured by the project. The
design consultai.ts would assist with the former as well as being responsible
for advising on contractor pre-selection and bid adjudication, and for
supervision of the internationally-recruited contractors who would execute the
tubewell drilling and construction of irrigation and on-farm development works.
5.04     Training and Extension in the project area would continue to be
organized under the T&V system, and the regional Office of Agriculture
(Department of Extension) in Seiyun would be responsible for recruiting the
additional staff to be financed by the project from the University or
technical college. The extension agents would work in coordination with the
research staff in Seiyun and would be assigned between the four project
cooperatives. The R&E staff would place emphasis on the assembly and
verification of production packages technologically better-suited to the
irrigated developments, particularly for crop rotations, fertilization, water
management and plant protection. Particular emphasis would be placed on
training farmers in the operation of improved irrigation systems, the
efficient use of farm machinery, and the diversification and intensification
of crop production. This would include 3pecific provisions for training women
farmers. At negotiations: (i) the detailed training program tor the project
was agreed upon; and (ii) assurances were obtained regarding the provision of
regular training programs for project personnel and men and women farmers
[para. 7.02(k)(i) and (ii)].
5.05     Inputs Supply.  The Seiyun branch of PCAS would be responsible for
the supply of inputs, such as seed, fertilizers and chemicals, through the
project cooperatives. Other inputs, e.g. packing materials and spare parts
for pumps, would be procured directly by PMU or by the Research Station. On
receiving annual orders from the cooperatives, the PMU would arrange for the
required inputs to be delivered directly to farm units or to the cooperative
depots. The PMU would ensure that equivalent amounts of inputs procured with
project funds are utilized by farmers in the project area (para. 5.13).
5.06     The Central Coordinating and Steering Committee (CCSC), established
for the implementation of WHAP II, would be maintained at c-ntral level for
the new project, under the chairmanship of the M,iiister of MAAR or his
deputy. The membership consists of the Project Manager, Director of
Agriculture of Hadramawt Governorate, the Directors of the MAAR Departments of
Irrigation, Planning, Cooperatives and R&E and representatives from the
Ministries of Planning and Finance and NBY. As necessary, other department
heads--PCAS, PCMFV, HTC, PCEP--would be invited to attend the meetings. The
functions of the CCSC, effectively executed in WHAP II, include policy and
program guidance, review and approval of annual work and financial plans and
supervision of procurement procedures, interagency coordination, review of



-29-
progress, and financial control of the project. The Committee would meet
quarterly and it would be served by its existing secretariat in MAAR.
5.07     The existing Local Advisory Comnittee (LAC) would be maintained with
membership including represenitatives of the Governor, the Party, the
Cooperatives and relevant departments of MAAR, the PCAS and the PCEP stationed
in Seiyun. The committee would continue to advise PMU on priorities relating
to project developments, make recommendations on annual work programs and
assist in periodic reviews of project progress. The PM acts as secretary to
the LAC.
5.08     In addition to their functions mentioned above, both CCSC and LAC
would closely monitor and coordinate the progress of the procurement of civil
works, goods and services, so as to avoid delays which could adversely affect
the project's progress. An assurance has been obtained from MAAR that both
the CCSC and LAC would continue to function during the period of project
implementation [para. 7.02(1)].
5.09     Fai-m machinery would be procured by PMU on behalf of the cooperatives
who would finance the purchase through credit agreements with NBY. This
arrangement is already operating satisfactorily for irrigation pumps under
WHAP II and is being applied to newly acquired tractors and implements. At
negotiations, assurance was obtained from Government concerning the signing of
a supplementary credit agreement by December 31, 1989 between Government and
NBY for investments in electric irrigation pumps, farm machinery and crop
production inputs [para. 7.02(m)].
5.10     By agreement, cooperative managers would distribute a tractor and
specific implements to each APU. While tractors and frequent use implements
would be for the exclusive use of each APU, in the interest of economy and
efficiency, certain implements, e.g. sprayers and grain threshers, would be
shared between several neighboring APUs. Sharing arrangements would be
specified in agreements and would be supervised by the cooperatives. Some
APUs have indicated preference to own their farm machinery, while others have
opted for a rental arrangement. In both cases, the cooperatives would make
charges on each APU sufficient to cover interest and reimbursement of
principle to NBY plus administrative charges. Detailed manuals for farm
machinery maintenance (para. 5.15) would specify the relative responsibilities
of APUs, cooperatives and MRS. Log books would be provided for each APU; and,
together with investment payments, charges for spares and maintenance work
would be paid by individual APUs through their cooperative (para. 6.18).
5.11     The cooperatives would strengthen their inputs supply and marketing
services to farmers and APUs uithin the project area. The project would not
be directly involved with credit since this function is already bein, carried
out satisfactorily between the cooperatives and NBY in the Wadi Hadramawt
area. The four project cooperatives have adequate financial reserves to
provide any incremental short-term credit required for financing inputs for
project farmers. With the adjustments in marketing arrangements, the central
role of cooperatives for marketing produce is expected to decline. However,
they would continue to purchase scheduled crops. Cooperatives' operating
costs would continue to be met from the handling charges (5X) on inputs and
produce. In view of their important role in project implementation, it has
been agreed that MAAR will provide management training for key personnel in
the four project cooperatives as part of the PMU training program (para. 3.18).



-30-
B. Project Implementation
5.12     Project implementation is planned for six years as shown in Chart 2.
An early start to proposed groundwater based irrigation development works
would be ensured through the outline for tender designs agreed upon during
appraisal. It is anticipated that the early engagement of services for
engineering consultants and for contractors (para.. 4.40) would enable well
drilling, pump installation and pump house constructions to be mostly
completed by PY3. Flood protection works would be undertaken during PYs 3 and
4, while land levelling and construction of the irrigation distribution
networks would be completed in PY3. The schedule for construction of
groundwater-based irrigation development works is shown in Annex 5, Table 2.
The spate irrigation works would be implemented throughout the project
period. Most of the procurement of equipment and vehicles for project staff
and for agricultural development components would be completed by PY4, while
maintenance equipment and some vehicles for Engineering and Administration and
the IMU would be purchased in PY2.
5.13     In order to further encourage agricultural development in the
Phase II areas, additional farm machinery would be provided in PY2 for
increasing the cropping intensity. Agriculture development in the new areas
is planned to commence in Al Qat'n and Shibam cooperatives and move to Seiyltn
and Tarim cooperatives. Consequently, machinery purchases would be phased
delivering to farmers in Al Qat'n and Shibam in PY3 and, to farmers in Seiyun
and Tarim cooperatives by PY4. The incremental crop production inputs For
Phase II areas would be uniformly spread over the 5-year project period,
while, for the new project areas, they would be utilized during the last three
years of the project. However, in view of the relatively small quantities
involved (1,300 tons), procurement of inputs would be completed, through ?CAS,
in PY3 and PDRY would ensure adequate allocation of foreign exchar.ge funds
each year (para. 2.12) so as to guarantee timely and sufficient supplies of
inputs to project farmers through their cooperatives (paras. 3.2, and 5.05)
and in line with IDA qualitative guidelines. Assurances on these points were
obtained at negotiations [para. 7.02(n)].
5.14     Based on the estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 4, Table 4), the
date estimated for (i) physical completion is June 30, 1996, and (ii) credit
closing is June 30, 1997.
C. Operation and Maintenance
5.15     Each 50 ha farm unit would be operated independently and the
APUs/APGs would be responsible for organizing the operation and general
maintenance of its own pump irrigation distribution systems and farm machinery
(paras. 4.20 and 5.10). The forms of agreement, which are being issued to
cooperatives and APUs and which specify ownership rights over irrigation pumps
and farm machinery, were scrutinized during negotiations and are acceptable to
IDA. Technical advice for the operation of these equipments will be provided
by the cooperatives, IMU and MRS. Major maintenance works, involving concrete
or large volumes of earthworks requiring the use of civil engineering
equipment or specialist advice, will be planned and executed by the IMU in
collaboration with MRS (or, eventually, private contractors). Government is
acting to establish an IMU for Wadi Hadramawt, to be responsible for
monitoring abstraction of groundwater and for planning and coordinating
routine preventative maintenance and remedial repairs of irrigationi structures



-31-
and pumps in collaboration with MRS. The establishment of IMU is a condition
fo. credit effectiveness [para. 7.01(b)).
5.16     In coordination with the cooperatives and MRS, PMU has prepared
organization guides and operation and maintenance manuals for on-farm works,
irrigation pumps and farm machinery. These were agreed upon at negotiations
and formal statements specifying responsibilities of all APUs, cooperatives
and MRS are being issued. Each cooperative will supervise machinery
operations by its APUs and basic maintenance will be done by designated
tractor operators in each APU in line with the manual. Schedules are being
established for routine preventive maintenance and remedial repairs which will
be coordinated by the cooperative and undertaken by MRS.
5.17     In areas benefiting from spate rehabilitation, the beneficiary
communities would assume responsibility for routine O&M of the structures.
The rehabilitation of flood damages and special repair works beyond the
capacity of the beneficiary communities would be planned and supervised by the
IMU and funded by Government through the DOI. Beneficiary farmers would
participate through labor contribution.
5.18     The PMU would be responsible for planning, coordinating and
supervising maintenance work on farm roads, tubewells, farm machinery,
irrigation networks and spate irrigation works provided under the project and
according to above arrangements, and shall provide, or cause to provide,
sufficient funds, services and other resources to execute this work. For
these purposes the vehicles and machinery of the IMU shall be replaced
promptly at the end of their economic life (para. 6.30).
D. Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
5.19     The PMU would have overall responsibility for M&E and for periodic
reporting. Three types of monitoring would be followed: (a) project input,
requiring M&E of activities such as civil works, procurement, staffing and
implementation of crop development programs; (b) project output, involving M&E
of increased production and project impact; and (c) M&E of hydrological/
hydrogeological aspects, soil salinity and groundwater quality. All of these
functions would be performed by the existing Units within the PMU.
5.20     Input Monitoring would be done by the project M&E Unit, and would
cover: (a) administration and finance unit for progress of financial and
staffing affairs; (b) engineering unit for progress with civil works and
procurement; and (c) agricultural unit regarding crop production programs.
Technical assistance specialists and consulting engineers would assist in the
monitoring programs and in the preparation of progress reports. For project
input monitoring, the PMU would submit periodic reports using formats
established for WHAP II and indicating both financial and physical progress
toward annual plan targets.
5.21     Output Monitoring for agricultural developments would be measured in
both the Phase II and the new development areas. Monitored outputs would
include: (a) farmers' adoption of R&E recommendations; (b) changes in
cropping intensities; (c) crop yields; and (d) net farm incomes. In
conjunction with the R&E staff, the M&E unit in the PMU would be responsible
for this work. The PMU would report annually to the LAC and, through the
Directov of DOI,. to the CCSC and IDA on key indicators relating to project
impact. These indicators, outlined at negotiations, will be implemented by



-32-
MAAR Planning Department, in consultations with IDA, prior to project
initiation.
5.22     Evaluation.  Continuous management analysis would be done by PMU with
assistance from technical assistance specialists and, for longer term
agricultural development planning, in cooperation as necessary with the MAAR
Planning Department. This evaluation function provides the key to continued
improved performance under the project and the degree to which research
results are used to make adjustmerts in the agricultural practices and the use
of inputs. The CCSC would also .aluate the program periodically and special
studies would be arranged through the annual work program, as required.
5.23     Water Resource Monitoring.  The flood, rainfall and groundwater
monitoring systen. has been reorganized and substantially extended under
Phase II. WMU/PMU (para. 5.02) would extend wadi gauge network to further
improve the knowledge of flood frequency and magnitude, longer-term rainfall
and runoff. The results of this monitoring are essential for environmental
aspects, particularly for groundwater quality and soil salinity, as well as
for further improving estimates of water balance components. The groundwater
moritoring would be extended by further calibrating the existing model and the
d, . collected would, in conjunction with the surface water observation
pr,ram, form the basis for refining the long-term estimates of aquifer
recharge and storage. The measurements of groundwater levels would also
provide essential information for assessment of the efficiency of increased
groundwater development. The record of observations would be included in
periodic project progress reports.
5.24     Reporting Requirements.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that: (a) PMU would be responsible for preparing and submitting to IDA:
(i) quarterly progress reports on the project focused on key indicators and
telexed to IDA immediately after the end of the first three quarters; and
(ii) annual reports for project developments in a format satisfactory to IDA
not later than three months after the end of the crop year (January); and
(b) not later than six months after completion of the project, MAAR will
furnish to IDA a completion report on the execution and preliminary operations
of the project, the benefits derived and to be derived from it, the
performance of project management and IDA of their respective obligations
under the proposed credit agreement, and the accomplishments of the purposes
of the proposed credit [para. 7.02(i)(ii)].
VI. PROJECT BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Agricultural Development
6.01     Future Cropping Patterns & Intensities.  Cropping patterns for the
project have been established on the basis of the present farming practices in
the Wadi Hadramawt area and on the experience gained on the pilot farms
established under WHAP I, farmers' initial experience under WHAP II, and
results from verification trials by the Seiyun Research Center. The projected
cropping patterns are in line with the Government's long-term aim of reaching
self-sufficiency in vegetable and fruit production and of sustaining minimum
levels of cereal production. These cropping patterns are centered on water
availability, soil capability, farmers' choices, market limitations, labor
availability and the scope for more efficient mechanization of farming
operations. On balance, these factors are expected to lead to a gradual shift
3 . s7Ir -   s     3



-33-
to higher return crops while maintaining significant areas in wheat, sorghum
and other traditional staple crops. A ranking in financial terms of the crops
best suited to growing conditions in Wadi Hadramawt, by return to land and
water resources, as calculated by the appraisal mission, is given in Table 6.1:
Table 6.1: NET CROP RETURNS AT FULL DEVELOPMENT (YD)

a/  Dates:  irrigated from tubewell but generally outside arable area.
b/ Alfalfa: 12 months production and 14 cuts.
6.02     Annual crop rotations would vary between farmers and APGs depending
upon their choice of enterprises and available family labor. An important
factor in the selection of crops grown would be the intensive labor
requirements for high-return crops. In the traditional rotation, summer
sorghum immediately follows winter wheat. The growing of vegetables in the
hot summer months of high water requirements would be restricted to the local
demand. Alfalfa and legumes would be maintained in the rotations both for the
high financial returns and for their value for soil nitrogen fixation. Other
types of forages, with lower water demand, would also be introduced under the
project, with a view to further improving productivity and encouraging water
conservation. Monoculture of the highest return crops would not be feasible
because of the need for a balanced rotation and restrictions on water and
labor supply and limited market demand.
6.03     In order to reflect existing variations in cropping patterns, the
areas in the Al Qat'n and Shibam districts have been grouped separately from
those in the Seiyun and Tarim districts when making projections fir project
benefits (Project Working Papers). Within a given cropping pattern, various
production intensities are feasible. Since agricultural developm,ent in
WHAP II has started to expand, farmers are readily adopting new' technologies
for intensifying production. As with the agricultural insti.utions concerned,
farmers are confident of achieving the 130% cropping intensity proposed under
the project, provided that: (a) standards of demonstration and extension
support are maintained; (b) installation, opo~ration and maintenance of
irrigation water supply is assured; and (c) inputs supplies are improved. For

6.04     Counting alfalfa and fruits twice, the cropping intensity in the new
development areas is currently estimated at 44Z; and after full project
development, the crop intensity is expected to be about 130X. No reduction in
the area of dates is anticipated and approximately 150 ha of fruit orchards
are expected to be established under the project. For evaluation purposes,
such areas are considered as replacement for the date palms that are senescing
and beyond economic rehabilitation. The main changes in crop production
during the period up to project maturity (PY10) include: (i) fallow or
presently unused land would be eliminated; (ii) winter sorghum would be
replaced by (the more profitable) winter wheat; (iii) pulses and legumes, both
of which would be valuable for raising the quality of nutrition and for
broadening the -ropping pattern, would be introduced; and (iv) potato and
vegetable production would be increased suLbstantially within the capacities of
labor availability and market demands (para. 3.16).

6.05     Crop Production.  Preser.t crop yields are low and for some controlled
crops give no return for farmer's labor. Local wheat yields range from about
1 to 1.3 tons/ha, high yielding variety wheat about 1.9 to 2.1 tons/ha, and
sorghum about 1.0 ton/ha. Yield increases expected under the project are
based on levels actually being achieved by the better farmers in irrigated
areas, and on yields obtained in research verification trials. The project's
impact on crop production would result from a combination of actions,
including: improvements in the quality and application of irrigation water,
dependable supply, distribution and operation of appropriate farm machinery,
reliable supply and more appropriate use of fertilizers, adoption of crop
protection techniques, better tillage practices, and crop rotations with
higher returns.
6.06     Comparison of crop yields and incremental production in the Project
area, before project and at maturity (PY10), detailed in Project Working
Papers, are summarized for the major crops in Table 6.3:

In addition, there would be incremental production, from increasing cropping
intensity from 110% to 130% in the Phase II areas, of about 1,180 tons of
wheat, 540 tons of sorghum, 2,900 tons of alfalfa, 35 tons of sesame, 780 tons
of onions, 600 tons of tomatoes and 1,380 tons of potatoes.
6.07     Date and Fruit Production.  The present area of date palms (about
275 ha) is expected to remain constant with the rehabilitation continuing
under the project. With rehabilitation, date production is expected to
increase from the present yield of about 8 kg per tree (1,040 kg per ha) to
about 30 kg per tree (3,900 kg per ha). Evidence from well managed orchards
indicates that production of 40 kg of dates per palm is readily achievable.
The demand for establishing fruit orchards is very buoyant. In order to have
some return during the seven-year establishment period for the (fruit) trees,
farmers would be encouraged to interplant with alfalfa, vegetables or other
high-value seasonal crops. This practice is already being successfully tried
out under WHAP II.



-36-
6.08     Livestock Production.  Livestock production is one of the most
profitable farming enterprises in the region and involves an important
economic integration between the nomad grazing of the range lands and the
settled farmers in the Wadi Hadramawt. The farmers purchase yearling goats or
sheep from the nomads and, with their fodder, surplus coarse grain and some
locally available feed concentrates, fatten the animals for sale after 4-5
months. In the existing free market situation, in the past decade, farmers
have doubled forage production in response to demands for expanding livestock
numbers.
6.09     The increased fodder production and crop residues resulting from the
Project, would enable further intensification of livestock production. The
estimated 1,060 farm families now engaged in livestock in the project area
could readily increase production by about 25Z. In evaluating increased crop
production, sorghum stover is included at its feed value, while it is assumed
that the traditional value of wheat straw for brick making would be
maintained. Benefits from the increased livestock values or productivity
resulting from the project have not been quantified.
B. Market Prospects and Prices
6.10     No major difficulties are foreseen in marketing the iriereased
production from the project. Most of these crops are currently imported, and
supply is the main constraint to increased consumption. The incremental
production of wheat, sesame and fruit and vegetables would find a ready market
in Wadi Hadramawt. Any increase in excess of local needs of potatoes and
other less-perishable vegetable production could be marketed in the other
parts of the Governorate, especially Mukalla, or in Aden.
6.11     All crop production inputs are supplied by PCAS through cooperatives;
and, for inorganic fertilizers and crop protection chemicals, farmers pay a
uniform national price (fixed since 1985) which, at current prices, includes
nearly 1001 surcharge over actual costs delivered to Seiyun. Locally produced
seeds are sold at cost and imported seeds (especially potatoes) are sold at
subsidized prices. Under its ongoing review of agricultural public
corporations, Government is examining pricing procedures for inputs, and
prices are likely to decrease during project implementation. Nonetheless, the
prices used for project financial analyses are maintained at the current
levels.
6.12     Except for seasonal price variations in vegetables, the Government
has maintained producer and consumer prices at the level established in 1982.
However, the relaxation in marketing controls proposed by Government would
allow for a larger role for the private sector, with prices relating to the
free market (para. 3.18). The bulk of the wheat and sorghum produced under
the project would be marketed through the Home Trade Corporation (HTC) at
official prices. Up to 60% of fruit and vegetables produced would be marketed
in the private sector, while the remaining 40% would be marketed at official
prices through PCMFV, which would reduce its retail operations to
high-quality, modern outlets, as well as providing wholesale services to
private retailers.  On average, farmers now obtain prices up to 70X higher for
vegetables in the open market than they receive when selling through the
Government channels.  Since there are no controls on fodder, the entire
production not used to feed the farmer's own livestock would be sold in the
open market.  As part of Government's marketing adjustments, it is agreed



-37-
that, when space permits, private traders would be able to rent PCMFV's Seiyun
storage or transport facilities at rates to be agreed with IDA (para. 3.23).
6.13     Increased production of some perishable vegetables could depress the
free open market prices during normal peak production seasons. However, as
project farmers would have a dependable year-round supply of irrigation water,
extension messages would be oriented to encouraging staggered plantings, with
emphasis for vegetable production in the off-season periods, so as to take
advantage of high market prices. Nonetheless, the project analysis has
assumed that crop prices would decline in response to increased supplies
during the period to maturity (PY10) to a level equivalent to the projected
economic prices.
C. Subsidies, Farm Incomes and Cost Recovery
6.14     There is no coordinated policy for agricultural subsidies and taxes
and, in some instances, Government is, unbeknowingly, subsidizing or
overcharging. Agricultural extension services are provided free.
Subsidization of electricity supply (30Z) and MRS soil cultivation (331)
result fron inefficiencies in the supply services and levels of payments made
by farmers are in line with commercial rates experienced in similar situations
in other countries. Subsidies on submersible pumps (252) are intended as a
temporary measure while farmers adopt the new technology; while those on
imported potato seeds (50Z) were adopted to expand production and substitute
for imported potatoes. Overall, these subsidies are outweighed by the
excessive charges on inputs. In the context of ongoing sector work, IDA is
assisting MAAR to define clearer strategies for deciding input/output prices,
where necessary.
Farm Incomes
6.15     By helping to remove constraints on farm operation, project
developments would enable a typical farm family to increase the intensity of
annual crop production from 2.5 ha (502) at present to 6.5 ha (130Z) at
project maturity (PY10). As a result, it is estimated that the gross value of
crop production would increase to YD 10,600, giving a net income of YD 7,750
after deduction of variable costs and a net profit of YD 5,455 per family
after payments for servicing pump and machinery loans, maintenance and
operating costs, and for overhead charges covering depreciation (over 25
years) and maintenance of irrigation earthworks. Table 6.4 provides a
comparison of costs and returns for a typical farm with and without the
project.

6.16     The incremental net income would result from improved efficiency in
resource utilization. Specifically: (a) land and water resources would be
better utilized as a result of irrigation engineering works, better water
quality, improved irrigation techniques and precision crop cultivation;
(b) production resources would be better utilized as a result of improved
supply, timing and application of inputs; and (c) human resources would be
better utilized as a result of training and extension services and reduction
of heavy manual work. The implications of intensified crop production is that
farmers would incur significantly highet investment and maintenance costs for
machinery and irrigation works than in the past. However, the incremental
3 1 6IC38/5   3 L  $ 9



-39-
benefits would be sufficient to ensure full financing and 0&M of the
investments at project maturity.
6.17     Cost Recovery.  For traditional farming in Wadi Hadramawt, farmers
financed diesel pumps through credit or from their own resources and land
leveling was by rudimentary hand tools or by MRS machines (for cash). Until
1989, Government charged 10S tax on the value of produce marketed through
cooperatives and public corporations. Effective collection rates varied
between 50S and 751. No other form of taxes have been levied on farmers. In
preparation for the introduction of land betterment tax, the production tax
rate was decreased in January 1989 to 5S on the value of produce sold.
Government's policy is to recover project investment and maintenance, charges
from the direct beneficiaries. Farmers in WHAP II areas are already paying
for machinery costs directly. Because of the traditional and social attitudes
to water rights, Government has decided that water users' charges would be
unacceptable. Furthermore, in view of the current stage of development in the
project area, it was decided that, at this point in time, the installation of
water meters for each APU would be impracticable. Recovery of depreciation
and maintenance costs for irrigation earthworks will, therefore, be made
through land betterment tax, for which draft legislation has been finalized
and enactment is expected by January 1990.
6.18     Under WHAP II, agreements for the purchase, maintenance and operation
of irrigation pumps and a tractor/implements machinery "package" include:
(a) provision of credit by NBY through cooperatives for individual APUs, with
repayment period of seven years. Agreements stipulate that, on completion of
credit payments, APUs will receive title deeds on these items;
(b) undertaking of: (i) routine maintenance by nominated and trained
operator(s) in each APU; and (ii) periodic overhauls and remedial repairs by
cooperatives/MRS, in accordance with manuals and work programs specified by
PMU. Each APU pays through its cooperative for spare parts and services
received; and (c) each APU pays directly for electricity and fuel consumed.
Agreement was reached with Government at negotiations on the cost recovery
procedures to be applied to APUs benefiting under the proposed project. In
view of the substantial pump and machinery charges being incurred by project
farmers, Government intends to introduce land betterment tax in phases, with
an initial annual charge of YD 10.5/feddan (US$73.5/ha) being applied two
years after the development of each APU. This level of payment is estimated
to be sufficient to fully cover IMU costs plus approximately 102 of
depreciation costs for irrigation earthworks (over 25 years), while a tax
level of YD 36/feddan (US$250/ha) p.a. would be necessary to cover the costs
fully. At negotiations, Government indicated its intention to reach this
level of payment through phased increases up to project maturity (PYIO). The
indicative Government cash flow for the project (Sources and Applications of
Funds) is shown in Annex 6, Table 1.
D. Benefits and Justification
6.19     Anticipated Overall Effects.  The sustainable higher crop returns
under the project would lead to improved standards of living for farm
families. The major benefits would derive from the increase in production of
cereals and other field crops, vegetables, and fruits, which would substitute
for imports of these commodities, and of fodder which would contribute to
increased meat production or cash income. As a result of import substitution,
foreign exchange savings would amount to an estimated YD 2.2 million (US$6.5
million) per annum at full development.
3     6 7 C I      4'   99



-40-
6.20     New developments under the project would directly benefit about 620
families including some 6,000 people, and it is estimated that their per
capita on-farm incremental income from crop production would increase from the
current estimated level of YD 79 to about YD 550 per annum by year 10 in areas
developed wholly for groundwater irrigation. A further 6,000 people would
benefit from WHAP II areas.
6.21     Non-quantified additional benefits would accrue from rehabilitation
of traditional spate irrigation works serving about 2,700 ha in tributary wadi
valleys. Direct benefits would result from the improved reliability of flood
diversion, while significant indirect benefits would result from erosion
control and increased recharge of the aquifers. The wadi tributaries selected
for spate improvement works are those where floods occur most frequently, thus
assuring the greatest possible benefits for this component. These wadis also
have a high density of date palms (about 1/4 of the area) which would continue
to degenerate in the absence of rehabilitation works. An estimated 1,400 farm
families would benefit directly from the spate irrigation and flood protection
works.
6.22     Other indirect benefits would include increased employment and more
stable incomes. The population in Wadi Hadramawt in general would benefit
from the availability of additional locally produced food and better water
quality. The strengthening of a number of the agricultural support services
by the Project would brnefit all farmers of the Wadi Hadramawt.  These,
together with benefits to be derived from the establishment of the proposed
IMU at the Governorate level, would be critically important for ensurirg
sustainability of developments after the project and, particularly, the
functioning of all irrigation works under both spate and tubewell irrigation.
6.23     Employment Effects.  At maturity (PY10), the project would create an
estimated incremental demand for 200 man-years of hired seasonal labor (mainly
for planting and harvesting), particularly where farmers increase the area in
intensive crops. However, these additional requirements are not expected to
rpsult in a labor shortage. Continued population growth (2.51 p.a.) in Wadi
Hadramawt, together with emigres returning from work assignments abroad, are
expected to make up for any increased labor demands created by the project.
Moreover, the mechanization to be provided under the project would
significantly raise labor productivity.
6.24     Income Distribution.  On average, the 1,200 families now farming in
the project area would have an average of 4.8 ha of newly developed land with
assured year-round irrigation water supplies.  Present farm incomes from crop
returns alone are quite low, somewhat better in the Al Qat'n and Shibam
cooperative areas than in the Seiyun and Tarim areas.
6.25     Economic Evaluation and Justification.  The principal direct benefits
at full project development would result from incremental crop production,
covering mainly wheat, sorghum, vegetables, potatoes, fodder crops, fruits and
dates.  The only new crop production is expected to be from pulses and legumes.
6.26     The economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated on the basis of
the anticipated crop intensities and yields and farmers' costs of production
under improved cultivation practices.  The total cost of all project-related
services have been included. No quantified benefits have been estimated for
the provision of the training and research component, from aquifer recharge or
from erosion and flood protection from improvements in spate controls. The
economic analysis is baseJ on the following assumptions:
3  S67C40 S 3 . 8 9



-41-
(a) all benefits and costs have been calculated in constant 1989
values, adjusted to represent benefits or costs at farm level in
the project area, as appropriate. Benefits and costs, where
applicable, have been adjusted for transfer payments such as
taxes and subsidies;
(b) border prices of wheat and sorghum have been derived from
established commodity price data. Economic prices of tomatoes
and other vegetables are based on financial prices in the open
market weighted for seasonal and variety variations. Economic
prices of fodder and sorghum stover have been based on
seasonally adjusted feed values in the project area. Wheat
straw has been priced at its current value for brick manufacture;
(c) all imported i.iputs, such as, fertilizer, chemicals and fuel
have been valued at actual or estimated 1989 border prices.
Family labor input was costed at the prevailing wage rate for
women (YD I/day) and, in view of limited alternative sources of
employment, at 50% of the going farm labor rates for men
(YD 5/day). The going farm labor rates have been used for all
hired labor;
(d) in view of their application to the entire Wadi Hadramawt area,
it is assumed that only 50Z of the recurrent costs for the IMU
and the tree nursery would be directly attributable to the
project;
(e) all incremental production and farm inputs utilization have been
phased in accordance with the anticipated buildup of the areas
cultivated and the projected yield increases. It has been
assumed that, for annual crops, benefits would be lagged by one
year and that the full anticipated yield levels would be
attained by PYlO; and
(f) a project life has been assumed at 25 years and costs have been
included for the replacement of investment items at the end of
their economic life. The without-project situation was
considered to be equivalent to the static present situation,
although the continued use of saline water from the shallow
aquifer would, inevitably, depress crop production.
6.27     Using these criteria and the data shown in Annex 6, Table 2, the
basic ERR for the consolidated project as described in Chapter 4, including
estimated incremental income from the Phase II, where cropping intensity is
assumed to rise to 110% through currert operations, and the new development
areas set against actual costs incur:ed during WHAP II plus estimated
incremental costs for WHAP III, is i3.1%. When the two phases are
disaggregated, the estimated ERR varies as follows:
(a)  Base Calculation:       Overall Cropping intensity 1302,
Total Phase II        actual total costs Phase II
plus Total            and total costs                            13.1%
Phase III             under Phase III.



-42-
(b)  Phase II Alone          Cropping intensity increasing
to 1101 and actual total costs.             6.61
(c)  Phase III alone         Overall cropping intensity 130S
and total incremental costs                18.61
under Phase III.
6.28     Sensitivity.  Analysis for deviations from the base calculation
(consolidated Phase II plus Phase III value estimate) shows the following
variations in ERR:
Benefits down 201            10.01
Costs up 201                 10.51
Benefits lag 2 years         10.31
Switching Values (at 101 opportunitv cost of capital):
- Costs must increase by 21%.
- Benefits must decrease by 201.
These analyses indicate that the project is mildly sensitive to variations in
benefits. For example, achieving overall cropping intensity of 1101, as
anticipated from the ongoing project, instead of 1301, would be equivalent to
a 0% decline in benefits, while a 401 reduction in the wheat straw price,
approximating to fodder value, would be equivalent to a 10% decline in
benefits.
E. Project Risks
6.29     As cost estimates are largely based on actual experiences during
WHAP II, the possibility of a cost overrun i.s minimal. Also, due to the
procedures being established for more rapid procurement, it is unlikely that
the project implementation would experience time overruns. An important
factor which supports the production targets and implementation schedule and
reduces the risk of time overrun is the existence of a proven PMU already
staffed with qualified personnel and having extensive experience of
construction and agricultural development under WHAP II. Government's current
actions to establish farmers' rights, including provision of long-term leases
and machinery ownership, greater freedom of choice, and introduction of O&M
charges, should serve to minimize risks and help ensure sustainable
development.
6.30     There are three main risks to the project:  (i) possible exceptional
flood damage to investments would be countered through design emphasis on
flood bunds and maximum feasible use of underground pipelines (para. 2.30);
(ii) non-implementation of policy changes relating to tenancy and liberalized
crop production; based on legislative changes already underway and discussions
and assurance at negotiations, this is not a high risk; and (iii) shortfall in
projected crop intensities and yields; this is unlikely in view of: 130%
cropping intensities are already being exceeded in verification trials, the
enthusiastic participation by WRAP II participants, and the conservative
targets adopted for crop yields. The weakest link in the implementation of
the Project is likely to be the provision of adequate recurrent funds to
ensure the sustainability of support services to farmers, including O&M
services and the ready availability of production inputs at required levels.

funds obligations for recurrent costs and future oil revenues are likely to
enable Government to substantiate its assurances on provision of foreign
exchange for recurrent expenditures (para. 5.18). Furthermore, the policy for
cost recovery being adopted by Government would ensure a high level of
autonomy and sustainability for the developments in Wadi Hadramawt.
Vll. CONDITIONS TO BE MET, ASSURANCES OBTAINED AND RECOMMENDATION

be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 9.3 million (US$12.0 million equivalent)
on standard terms with 40 years maturity. The Borrower would be the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen.
