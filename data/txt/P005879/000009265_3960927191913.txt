INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN (PDRY)
FOR A THIRD WADI HADRAMAWT AGRICULTURAL PROJECT (WHAP 
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to PDRY in the amount of SDRs 9.3 million (US$12.0 million
equivalent) for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 40 years maturity and would help finance the Third Wadi Hadramawt
Agricultural Project (WHAP III) estimated to cost US$41.8 million.
Cofinancing totalling US$20.4 million equivalent would be provided by the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development (KFAED). PDRY would contribute the remaining US$9.4
million equivalent of the project cost.
2.       Background.  PDRY is one of the poorest countries in the world, with
a population of nearly 2.3 million aiLd annual per capita gross domestic
product estimated at US$420. Scant natural resources, a harsh climate and a
shortage of skilled manpower severely limit the country's economic potential.
In the early/mid-1980s PDRY's economy suffered setbacks from severe floods
(1982), and continuous drought (1983-1986), civil disturbances and decline in
overseas remittances from Yemen migrant workers (the backbone to the economy
in 1970s) due to lower oil prices and, hence, reduced economic activities in
the Gulf countries. Recently, a limited number of oil resources have been
found which should be developed commercially over the next few years. While
this should boost the country's economic and financial resources, it is not
expected to fundamentally change PDRY's prospects.  Food accounts for about
one-third of the country's total import bill.  In order to reduce heavy
dependence on food imports, the Government's broad strategy is to optimize the
potential of agricultural resources.  IDA has helped to implement this
strategy through five credits totalling US$34.2 million involving wadi
developments, fisheries, and research and extension. Implementation of these
projects has mostly been successful, particularly for institution
development. Lessons learned focus mainly on the need for reducing central
controls, improving sustainability, and accelerating procurement procedures.
In the last year, a softening of the strongly regulated economic policies,
which have been followed in PDRY since independence (1967), has been
apparent. Policy adjustments, focussed on the Agriculture Sector, are
underway aimed at expanding agricultural productivity by providing security of
tenure to farmers, reducing central controls over production price and
marketing, and stimulating private sector activities.
3.       Annual rainfall, reaching 200 mm only in higher altitudes, imposes
desertic conditions over most of the country, restricting the land with
agriculture potential to 120,000 ha. About 60,000 ha, located in 12 widely
separated wadi systems, are cultivated annually, half through periodic spate
flows and half from groundwater irrigation, generally from shallow wells.
Cultivation, mostly by individual farmers who are cooperative members,
consists of: cereals and pulses (52%), foree (25%), perennial crops (15%),
vegetables and fruit (8%).  Livestock are   portant, with about 2 million

goats and sheep playing the dominant role. Agricultural output is generally
low, with annual growth rates since independence averaging about 2%. Apart
from limited natural resources, the main constraints have been: shortages of
trained personnel, inadequate inputs, low productivity and sustainability,
inappropriate Government policies and laborious procurement procedures.
4.       Wadi Hadramawt, a priority area for agricultural production, is
located in the center of PDRY and physically isolated by mountains and
desert. It has an estimated population of 225,000 people or some 22,000,
mostly rural families who are active farmers. Two IDA-supported agricultural
development projects (WHAP I; Cr. 615-YDR: US$7.0 million and WmAP II;
Cr. 1346-YDR: US$9.0 million) have helped to create infrastructure and
initiate intensive, groundwater based agricultural production on 3,225 ha.
IDA's involvement in these projects helped to attract cofinancing of
US$22.6 million from AFESD and KFAED. Extensive resources studies during
these projects have indicated capacity for expanding groundwater irrigation to
about 6,500 ha and for increasing sustainable agricultural production up to
150% cropping intensity. The impact of WHAP I and II has been significant
and, at completion (June 30, 1990), physical developments will have met or
exceeded their objectives. Project management and research/extension services
are developing well. Although exceptional floods in March 1989 caused damage
in the WRAP II area, the project structures proved effective, and an agreed
action plan will ensure full rehabilitation prior to initiation of WHAP III.
It is now important to increase agricultural productivity and to develop
procedures to ensure sustainable operation of the groundwater irrigation.
This requires a coordinated area development program, the creation of 0&M
procedures, inteusified production planning, and stronger support for inputs
supplies and extension services. The proposed project would focus on these
aspects.
5.       Project Obiective.  The proposed project would provide a program for
consolidating, expanding and ensuring sustained development of land and water
resources in the Wadi Hadramawt served area. In addition to completing
physical construction, developing organization and management, and
intensifying agricultural production, the project would encourage: long-term
lease agreements over land; greater autonomy by farm units on cropping
patterns, ownership and operation of irrigation pumps and farm machinery, and
crop marketing; improved monitoring of water resources and maintenance of
irrigation structure; and expanded agricultural support services.
6.       Project Descrition.  Financing would be included for:
(a) constructing 59 tubewells and irrigation infrastructure for an additional
3,025 ha; (b) rehabilitating spate irrigation works affecting 2,700 ha;
(c) creating a comprehensive Irrigation Maintenance Unit (IMU); (d) increasing
cropping intensity and consolidating agricultural services on some 6,250 ha
(3,225 ha existing/3,025 ha under proposed project) of groundwater irrigation
through: (i) expanding research trials for irrigated crops; (ii) extending the
supply of fertilizers and other modern inputs; (iii) providing subject matter
specialists (SMSs), field extension agents (FEAs) and additional facilities to
strengthen extension services; and (iv) improving the organization and
management of farm mechanization; (e) strengthening cooperatives' management
to streamline inputs supply and marketing of vegetables and fruit; (f) project
operating expenditures; and (g) training and technical assistance personnel
for developing irrigation systems and improving agricultural productivity.
Project organization would be assured by the existing Project Management Unit

(PMU). Extension services and backup research would continue to be supplied
through the Agriculture Research and Extension Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Agrarian Reform (MAAR), supported by the Agricultural Research
and Extension Project (CL. 1557-YDR).
7.       Actions Taken.  All issues were reviewed at appraisal and agreements
and understandings reached at negotiations. The underlying problems which
might jeopardize project outputs, relate to centralized policies on marketing
and land ownership, production quotas, and prices and marketing controls. In
1989, Government has initiated actions to alleviate these problems and in this
context, the following documents were presented to IDA prior to negotiations:
(a) formal statement by MAAR regarding irrigation works and pumps, and farm
machinery under the project, with respect to: (i) ownership rights and
operation and maintenance responsibilities, and (ii) cost recovery procedures;
and (b) final legislative proposals for formal agreements pertaiiiing to the
long-term use or ownership of land and trees. Furthermore, it was confirmed
that national production plans are now based on farmers' choices of cropping
and that private traders are now freely operating in the marketing of farm
produce.
8.       Actions Agreed. At negotiations, Government confirmed that of the
three subunits planned for the IMU in Wadi Hadramawt, one is established and
the two remaining will be operational by December 1989. Government also gave
assurance that operations of the Machinery Rental Service (MRS) (Wadi
Hadramawt) would be reviewed and strengthened by June 30, 1990.
9.       Rationale for IDA Involvement. Wadi Hadramawt constitutes the most
important single area with significant untapped water resources. Assistance
with consolidated and sustainable development of land and water resot.rees
would support the Government's policy of increasing agrieulttival produ.titon
and reducing imports.  The project forms a logical extension ti the First and
Second Phase developments, and would complement operationb ot the ongoiag
Research and Extension Project   It would also contribute to p.olicy and
institutional improvements by securing long-term tenancy agtMwpments for
farmers cultivating irrigated lands, piloting a mechanism for adequate cost
recovery, developing routine maintenance of water resources by IMU, and
encouraging autonomous management of £arm units.
10.      Benefits.  Immediate benefits would include sustainable increase in
crop returns and higher standards of living for some 1,250 farm families who
would be direct beneficiaries. The population of Wadi Hadramawt as a whole
would benefit from increased food supplies and improved services for
irrigation and agriculture. At full development, estimated foreign exchange
savings from import substitution would reach YD 2.2 million (US$6.5 million)
p.a. The project would also help to ensure optimum utilization and
conservation of land and water resources, as well as initiating improvements
in planning, economic and institutional procedures affecting the agriculture
sector. The estimated internal rate of return for the combined Phase II and
III developments is 13b.
11.      Risks.  Although technologically conservative, the main risk to the
project concerns levels of cropping intensity which could be jeopardized by
inadequate incentives resulting from absence of long-term leases or weak
support services, especially for farm mechanization and inputs. Improvements
in organization would help to minimize these risks; and, in view of actions

-4-
already initiated by Government and assurances obtained at negotiations, the
policy questions are unlikely to hinder the project in reaching its objectives.
12.      Recomnmendatks.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
