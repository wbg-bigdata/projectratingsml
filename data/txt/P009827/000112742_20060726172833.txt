EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
TAMIL NADU RURAL WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION PROJECT - SWAp
(WORLD BANK ASSISTED)
SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT FRAMEWCORK
Background
1. The Govt of Tamil Nadu (GoTN), in its development agenda for the Tenth Plan (FY 2002-2007),
has accorded a high priority for provision of rural water supply and sanitation (RWSS) facilities in
the state. The GoTN intends to scale up the demand responsive approach state wide for the RWSS
sector. In keeping with the priority, the GoTN has maintained a high level of investment in the
sector.
2. The identified goals for the Tenth Five Year Plan of the state envisage 'water se&urity' including
drinking water health and ecological security. The target for water has been set as "full coverage of
all the rural habitations in the state with a minimum of 40 lpcd supply and 55 Ipcd wherever
possible' as well as 'full and independent coverage of habitations where socially marginalized
groups live". For sanitation facilities, the target is in terms of "coverage of the rural population with
individual or cluster toilets" with a goal to achieve 50 percent coverage by the endJ of the Plan
period.
Proposed TNRWSS Project
3. The GoTN is seeking World Bank assistance in implementing its 5 year medium term RWSS
programme in the state and intends to take forward its 10th Plan Vision which has been formulated
with the following objectives.
* Adoption of demand driven approach, user participation and cost recovery
.  Redefining the role of government I governmental agencies from 'provider 'to 'facilitator'.
. Rainwater harvesting, establishment of ground water recharge structures for source
sustainability
. Coverage of rural population and institutions with sanitation facilities and safe disposal of
domestic liquid and solid waste
. Capacity building and community empowerment in planning, implementing and managing
the water and sanitation facilities with due cost sharing
4. The three main components identified for inclusion in the proposed TNRWSS Project are;
Community development and RWSS infrastructure building
*  Community and Village Panchayat Capacity Building
.  Women's Development Programme
*  Construction / upgradation of drinking water supply, drainage and sanitation schemes,
including water quality monitoring program and
*  Targeted SC/ST development plan.
Institution building
*  Sector management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systiems
.  IEC campaigns
.  Capacity building of program staff and support agencies
. Technical assistance for reorganisation of TWAD
_ Future sector planning
. Developing long term policies and strategic plans

water quality bulletins and reports for the benefit of the users even at the lowest village level.
Socio-economic environment
Population
31.  Tamil Nadu is the 6th most populous State in India with a total population of 62.11 million
(2001 Census) comprising 31.26 million male and 30.84 million female populatiQn. It is also
one of the most urbanised States in India with 27.24 million .people living in urban areas
while the rest 34.87 million constitute the rural population. The State's total literacy rate is
73.47% (male: 82.33%, female: 64.55%), the second highest in tlhe country.
Rural water supply coverage
32.  The status of rural water supply coverage of habitations in the state is given in Table -4.

Under the 'not covered' habitations about 416 habitations come under 0 Ipcd coverage, 5684
under 1-9 lpcd coverage and 7549 habitations come under quality affected habitations.
33.  The status of water supply coverage by districts as on 2002 is presented in Fig. 4.
Rural Sanitation Status
34.  As per the 2001 Census, only 14 percent (1187919) of the total households (8274790) have
toilets within the house. Region-wise, in northern and western regions account for a higher
percentage of households without toilet facility than the State figure. About 88 percent of
total. households in the northern region do not have toilet facility.
35.  As per the distribution of households by toilets among the districts of Tamil Nadu, more than
90 percentage of households do not have toilet facility in Villupuram and Thiruvannamatai
districts (northern region), and Perambalur and Ariyalur districts (eastern region), while
60.39 percent of households in Kanyakumari district have toilet facility followecd by 32.19
percent in Nilgiris district. . Of the 29 districts in Tamil Nadu, except two districts, viz.,
Kanyakumari and Nilgiris all the remaining districts have very poor sanitation coverage.
36.  As per Census 2001, about 73 percent of the total households in rural areas of Tamil Nadu
do not have any type of drainage facility for wastewater from the house. Of the remaining 27

rapid fall in water level (Kondappanayanapalli, Manjini, Arnmapatti, Palaiaseevaram,
Melachamangalam). Instances are common where people are forced to buy water from
commercial vendors to meet their needs. Inequity in distribution of supply due to inherent
system constraints is also noticed in some cases (Melachamangalam). In addition, there are
instances where the newly developed areas in the villages are yet to get the benefit of piped
water supply.
Quality issues:
42.  The poor quality of water supplied is an equally serious concern of the people in the sample
viJlages. The high TDS and the associated taste are not acceptable to people
(Melachamangalam, Manjini, Thirunagari). There are also complaints from people regarding
a gradual deterioration in the quality of ground water drawn from bore-wells. Instances of
sub-surface water drawn from riverbeds having been polluted due to the discharge of
industrial effluents are also reported (Palaiaseevaram, Kannadikuppam). In the absence of
a better option, they have to be content with the quality of the supply. Those who are
economically well off, buy water of better quality from vendors or bottled water for drinking.
Though no data is readily available regarding the bacteriological quality of water supplies,
serious outbreaks of waterborne diseases have not been reporteci.
Falling ground water level:
43.  A common concern of the people in the sample villages is the fast declining ground water
level resulting in the drying up of the source or reduction of the yield (Palaiaseevaram,
Manjini, Melachamangalam). This is attributed to the failure of monsoon rains in the last four
years and the increasing demand for various uses.
Household sanitation issues:
44.  The sanitation coverage in general is very low in all the sample villages visited and the age-
old practice of open defection is widely prevalent. People are willing to construct their
individual household latrines for which they are ready to contribute. In some Oases, because
of space constraints, people seem to prefer cluster toilets or community toilets. Lack of
awareness among people regarding the inter-relationship between water, sanitation and
health is common in all the villages.
Environmental sanitation issues:
45.  Lack of sanitary methods of sullage and solid waste disposal is felt in almost all sample
villages. Absence of good internal roads, proper approach roads to village burning ghats,
inadequate street lighting are some of the common complaints from the villagers
(Melachamangalam, Manjini, Thirunagari). Stagnant pools of sullage leading to mosquito
nuisance is also reported (Kannadikuppam).
Willingness to participate in the proposed TNRWSS Project:
46.  During the public consultatiohs the participants were specifically informed of the proposed
TNRWSS project; its scope and objectives. A special mention was made on the roles and
responsibilities of the beneficiary community frorh planning to implementatior and sustained
operation and maintenance of the assets that will be created under the proposed project.
The initial response has been, by and large, positive (T.Karisalkulam, Pulatheri, Manjini,
Kondappanayanapalli, Rettakurichi, Melachamangalam, Kannadikuppam). In certain cases
there has been a hesitation to accept the idea of financial contribution (Pa laiaseevaram,
Koppur, Thirunagari). In the backdrop of the deep-rooted mindset that the tbasic amenities

over exploitation of ground water for agricultural and industrial uises. As per information from
the PWD, there are 138 number blocks in the State which have been cate orised as 'over-
exploited', 37 blocks under category 'critical', 105 blocks under category 'se mi-critical' while
the rest of the blocks come under the 'safe' category.
Mitigatory measures
51.  Augmentation of existing water supplies can be achieved through one or more of the
following options.
a) Augment through rehabilitation I upgrading of existing systems wherever feasible
b) Identification of new sources (local / distant) of good quality and yield + safety
chlorination. These will be mostly ground water sources. In areas not affected by
chemical contaminants, new good-yielding ground water sources could be identified
using modern geophysical techniques (to minimize failure rate) or existing privately
owned irrigation wells of good yield and potable quality could be identified and
acquired.
c) Local surface sources (village ponds / streams/ canals) which require only simple
treatment (SSF / river bed filtration) and chlorination, Existing Village tanks, if
considered as an alternate source, need to be desilted / enlarged to increase their
storage capacity and protected by fencing to prevent contamination from human I
animal access. For villages located in the vicinity of seasonal rivers / streams the
feasibility of tapping sub-surface flow (riverbed filtration) could be explored.
d) Distant surface sources with simple treatment (SSF) ancl chlorination for a group of
villages (multi village schemes)
e) Dual water supply - existing supplies (rejected by community due to quality problem)
for purposes other than drinking and potable water supply through any of the options
listed above.
f) Appropriate blending of water from existing sources (ground water) to obtain water
meeting the drinking water quality standards.
g) Effective enforcement of Tamil Nadu Ground Water Act to regulate and control ground
water abstraction to -accord priority for drinking water. Identified critical areas with
falling water level should be notified forthwith by the Appropriate Authprity and the Act
enforced in all its earnestness to halt this trend.
h) Concurrent ground water recharge at the source to promote source sustainability.
This activity should receive priority in order to achieve sustainability of water supply
sources. The PWD should conduct a detailed survey to identify potential sites and
appropriate conservation structures such as check dams, sub-surface dykes, recharge
trenches, abandoned borewells etc. best suited to the local conditions.
i) Regular monitoring of ground water level: The PWD / TVAD Board should regularly
monitor the ground water level in the project area as an integral part of overall
monitoring program.
52.  The key consideration in deciding on the alternative should be to elimihate, as far as
practicable, the need for any treatment. A trade off analysis of the feasible options should
be clearly presented to the beneficiary community to enable them to decide on their choice.
Water quality issues
53.  The water quality problem in the State is essentially of three types (i) the nat ral presence in
ground water of chemical contaminants such as fluoride, TDS, iron and nitrate of geological
origin in concentrations exceeding the levels permissible in drinking water and (ii) the
chemical / bacteriological contamination of water at the source, due to municipal and

Mitigatory measures
i. Effective, sustained IEC campaign to generate demand for ownerst lip based group
latrines, community latrines and institutional latrines and their p roper use and
maintenance;
ii. Construction of sullage drains including treatment and disposal works. A network of
well planned drains for disposal of sullage from the village, including spill water from
the public stand posts should be designed and constructed especially along the main
roads / lanes in the village. Equally important is the safe treatment of the collected
sullage and utilisation of the treated effluent. Stabilization ponds could provide the
simplest method of treatment and the treated effluent could be used for agricultural
purposes I grass farms for fodder. The VP can prepare an action plan for the purpose
so as to generate income to the VP which can defray part of the O&M expenditure.
Water and sanitation related health issues
i. Cholera and typhoid cases have also been commonly reported. There is also the
problem of high fluoride in drinking water in many districts. A large number of cases of
worm infestation have also been reported.
ii. The personal hygiene standards - of the people in general, especially of the
economically disadvantaged, is very poor.
iii. Health and hygiene education programmes are not effectiv,e.
iv. Lack of awareness and non-affordability to meet the medical expenses by some of the
people who suffer from water-borne & water related diseases aggravate the situation
which leads to outbreak of epidemics.
Mitigatory measures
i. Effective, sustained Self Help programmes with special focus on women and children
to create a felt need for household latrines and also to adopt desirable personal I
family and community hygiene practices.
ii. Preventive and curative measures including regular de-worming programmes.
iii. An organized survey by well trained medical doctors ancl para / non medical staff to
identify fluorosis cases especially among school children, pregnant women and
lactating mothers to carry out programme of curative medication including nutritional
supplements in addition to supply of safe defluoridated water.
Identification of Environmental Risk and Impacts
56.  The potential environmental risks and impacts arising from the project interventions during
the preparatory, construction and operation phases have been identified, classified as
positive I negative and presented in a matrix form in Table -6.
57.  The overall impact of the project on the beneficiary communities and the environment is
expected to be positive resulting in an improvement in the health and quality of life of the
people in the project area. Adverse impacts, if any, could be minimised / compensated by
incorporating appropriate mitigation measures to be integrated in the project design.

Environmental Management Framework
58.  Under the proposed TNRWSS Project a large number of individual villacle schemes and
stand alone schemes are expected to be implemented. Most of these schenmes are not likely
to pose any serious environmental concerns to be addressed in the project design. With a
view to facilitating this process, a simple check list has been designed as given in Table 7a
for Individual schemes and Table 7b for Multi village schemes. The duly illed in checklist
should form an essential part, as a supplement of the project proposal to be submitted by
the client. The broad contents of the project proposal is listed in Annex 7.1. This will enable
the review agency (DWSA - DPMU) to vet the proposal from environmental perspective for
further processing of the proposal and funding.
Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation
59.  In order to facilitate assess the impact of the project on the identified environimental issues, a
list of environmental performance indicators has been identified as also the agencies
responsible for monitoring as shown in Table 8.
Codes of practices for Rural Water Supply
60.  In keeping with the water supply systems to be designed and installed tn the proposed
TNRWSS project, codes of -practices on the following topics have been prepared. These
could be refined as necessary for inclusion in the technical manual to be prepared by TWAD
Board for the proposed project.
Water Supply:
Source identification and selection by remote sensing and geophysical methods
Sanitary survey of water supply sources
Principles of water supply source protection
Sanitary protection of Wells through cement grouting
Slow / Sand filtration
*      Defluorideation by i) Nalgondatech ii) Activated aluvium
*      Differential pressure bleach powder solution dosing equipment for disinfection of small
pumped water supplies
.      Chlorine safety measures
.      Designing of rainwater harvesting structures
*      Groundwater recharge methods

7.3.5   Environmental Monitoring and Supervision arrangement during implemnentation
The implementation of water supply schemes are likely to result into vaiying level cf environmental
impacts, that would require supervision and monitoring. The table below outlines a set of monitoring
indicators, which should be integrated into supervision plan for monitoring the effectiveness of
implementation particularly, the Environmental mitigation measures.
The environmental monitoring and supervision will be undertaken to ensure comr pliance with the
recommended environmental mitigation measures. The supervision of implementa ion will be the
responsibility of the Manager (monitoring and evaluation) from the District Programrrie Management
Unit (DPMU). This task will be undertaken by an experienced environmental engineer. There would
also be periodic monitoring and supervision by the funding agency to ensure compliance with the
respective safe guard policy.
The following Table 7.4 summarises the monitoring and supervision plan.

Draft Final Report                                                          TWAD Board
1       Introduction
1.1     Tamil Nadu Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (TNRWSSP)
The Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) is seeking World Bank assisitance in the implementation of its
5 year medium term Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) program in the State. GoTN has
prioritized RWSS as a key area of its development agenda in its Tenth Plan (FY 2002-07).
Accordingly, the GoTN intends to scale up the demand responsive approach state wide for the RWSS
sector and maintain a high level of investment in the sector with high priority.
In the GoTN's Tenth Five Year Plan clear goals have been identified for 'water security', including
drinking water, health and ecological security. It also emphasizes demand responsive approaches for
both rural water and sanitation. Within these approaches, the target for water siupply has been
identified as "full coverage of all the rural habitations in the State with a minimum of 40 Ipcci supply
and 55 lpcd wherever possible" as well as "full and independent coverage of habitations where
socially marginalized groups live". For sanitation facilities, the target is in terms of "coverage of the
rural population with individual or cluster toilets" with a target to reach 50% coverage by the end of the
Plan period. The Plan emphasis, however, is on measures to ensure sustainability of RWSS systems
rather than simply allocations and investments to build new facilities. It argues for "a paradigm shift in
the approach to the WSS sector" and for the output to be "measiured in terms of health spin off,
environmental benefits, empowerment of women and marginalized sections of the society, and
human resource development." For this, institutional reforms have been proposed with particular
emphasis on decentralizing RWSS service delivery responsibility to the rural local governments and
village water and sanitation committees and changing the role of Government / Government agencies
from that of a 'provider' to 'facilitator'.
In order to identify the viability of the proposed TNRWSS Project, various project anailysis studies are
being carried out. These include: (a) Sector Environmental Analysis; (b) Capa0ity Building & Sector
Project Implementation Plan (SPIP), (c) Economic Analysis, (d) Rapid Sector Assessment, (e) Social
Assessment, and (f) Sanitation Hygiene Promotion (SHP).
1.2     Sector Environmental Analysis and Management Framework (SEA&MF)
The purpose of the SEAMF is to evaluate the TNRWSS project's potential environmental risks and
impacts in its area of influence; examine project alternatives; identify ways of improving project
selection, siting, planning, design and implementation by preventing, minimizing, mitigating, or
compensating for adverse environmental impacts and enhancing positive impacts throughout project
implementation.
SEAMF has taken into account the natural environment (air, water and land); human health and
safety including the country's overall policy framework, national legislation, and institutional
capabilities related to the environment and obligations of the country, pertaining to lproject activities,
under relevant international environmental treaties and agreements. The SEA is expected to serve as
a complement to project specific EAs in the Development Plan.
1.3     Purpose of Study
The proposed environmental category, as per Bank's safeguard PFolicies, of the Tamil Nadu Rural
Water Supply & Sanitation Project (TNRWSSP) is B, which iis consistent with the potential
environmental impacts of the project The objective of the EA study is to identify upfront the

environmental issues of concern in the context of the proposed project and appropriate mitigation
measures thereof so that these can be integrated in the formulation of the project. Accordingly, the
Terms of Reference (ToR) for the EA study have been formulated as in Annex 1.1.
1.4     Scope of the study
The initial scope of the study included environmental analysis of both rural water supply and
sanitation activities, to be financed under the project. However, it is understood now that the project is
not likely to finance sanitation component. But the report includes einvironmental issues, impact and
mitigatory measures for sanitation as well which could be used by GoTN while implementing the
sanitation component and can be used as resource material for developing IEC programme. The
summary of report will be translated in Tamil and made available for public notice.
1.5     Methodology
The methodology followed in conducting the Environmental Assessment study as depicted in Fig. 1.1
is briefly described below:
1.5.1   Data Collection and Review
The methodology basically comprised collection and collation of secondary data on water resources
availability, their utilisation, problems of water quantity and quality as relevant in the context of the
proposed TNRWSSP, demographic, socio-economic and health aspects, water supply and sanitation
coverage and service levels and problems in O&M of existing water supply systems. The study also
included an analysis of policy, legal and institutional framework related to water and sanitation with
specific focus on Tamil Nadu. A review and analysis of this information led to the delineation of the
baseline status of relevant environmental components pertaining to the State and provided the basis
for assessment of the potential environmental impacts due to the proposed project and preparation of
environmental management framework (EMF) for mitigating adverse impacts and enhancing
beneficial impacts.
The present study has primarily relied upon the available secondary sources of data relevarnt to the
proposed project. The main sources of such information comprised the TWAD Board, the PWD, the
DRD, the TNPCB and the DPH. Data pertaining to groundwater was also mobilized from the CGWB.
The TWAD as the nodal agency for provision of water supply and sewerage infrastructure in the
State, has generated over the years enormous data pertaining to water services. Such data includes
water supply coverage in the State, sources of water supply, water quality of rural and urban schemes
etc. The TWAD has one of the best equipped water analysis laboratories in the State and is the first
such laboratory in the country to obtain ISO 9002 certification. The State Surface and Groundwater
Data Centre of the PWD has also well established lab facilities.
Water quality status has been reviewed from the data collected from the TWAD Board and the PWD-
SG&SWD Centre. There are differences in water quality data reported by these organisations,
especially with reference to the four major parameters namely TDS, F, Fe and NO3 since the sampling
locations differ. While the TWAD analyses water quality in drinking water sources, PWD has a
network of control wells, open wells, bore wells with piezo-meter/ hydro geological settings. Hence,
the Consultants have primarily relied on the TWAD data in view of the primacy accorded to potability
of water supplies by the TWAD.

As for quantitative data (availability and use), reliance has been placed on the data generated by the
PWD and the State and Central Groundwater Boards as also the Groundwate wing of the TWAD
Board which has developed extensive database and information products on water quantity and
quality.
1.5.2   Preliminary Site Visits
In order to prepare the community for their participation during public consultatiohs, it was decided to
undertake preparatory visits to the sample VPs. The purpose of these visits was to meet with the
elected representatives of the VPs as also the target population and officials of the various
development departments at the village, taluk / district levels to sensitise them regarding the proposed
TNRWSS project, as also their role and stakes in the project. During these preparatory meetings, the
participants were informed about the public consultations that were to follow. This advance intimation
was aimed at providing adequate time and opportunities to the target groups to formulate / firm up
their views regarding their participation in the proposed project.
The team, which organised these meetings, comprised representatives of the TWAD, the EA
Consultants and local body representatives. The preparatory visits also enabled collection of available
secondary data on the existing status of water supply, sanitation, public health and personal and
environmental hygiene in the sample VPs through key informant interviews and on-site observations.
1.5.3   Public Consultations
In keeping with the World Bank's OP 4.01, Public Consultations were organized, as part of the EA
Study, in eleven sample Village Panchayats selected from 10 districts of Tamil Nadu. The objective of
these consultations was to identify upfront the environmental issues as related to the proposed
activities under the TNRWSS project, to assess the views of the lbeneficiary community and their
willingness to participate in the project in a 'demand driven' planning and decision rnaking process.
The purpose of the consultations was also to identity the priorities anid preferences of the target group
in respect of the proposed project components including alternatives, if any.
1.5.4   Criteria for selection of sample Panchayats
The criteria adopted for selection of sample Village Panchayats for public consultations are as follows:
*  Geographical distribution
*  Geological set up
*  Existing water supply service level / prevalence of water scarcity
*  Status of groundwater development
*  Existence of water quality problems - presence of Nitrate, Fluoride, Iron, TDS,
brackishness, pollution etc. and
*  Pre-dominance of indigenous people - SC/ST population.
The location map of Tamil Nadu showing the districts and the sample VPs are shown in Fig. 1.2. The
public consultations had been preceded by the IEC activities. In public consultations, the participation
of local NGOs, Panchayat Raj Institutions, and women self help groups (SF IGs), economically I
socially weaker sections, informed / knowledgeable public and opinion leaders, eltc. was mobilised.
The participants to the consultations were briefed on the proposed TNRWSS F'roject, its objectives
and the rules for participation in the project.

2       Rural Water Policy and Environmental Framework
2.1     Chronology of development
Since Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) is a state subject, funds for the development of the
sector have been provided in the annual state budgets, starting with the First Five Year Plan under
the 'National Water Supply and Sanitation Programme', introduced in the Social Welfare Sector in
1954. During the initial years, the programme mainly concentrated on the construction of open wells
in habitations having no drinking water wells and where the number of open wells was not adequate.
These works were being executed with people's participation.
During the 1960s, only easy habitations were being attended to, leaving the difficult habitations.
Recurring droughts in the state made the situation worse with the falling ground water table, drying up
of open wells resulting in acute scarcity of drinking water. At this juncture, the state government felt
the need to develop deep bore wells particularly in hard-core habitatiions. A bore wells programme
was started by the Government in the early seventies with assistance from UNICEF aind thus, there
was a marked shift in emphasis from construction of open wells to bore wells.
For effective implementation of the programmes, it was necessary to identify areas of water scarcity
and to lay down priorities. The following criteria were adopted for identification of "difficult" habitations:
-  Habitations without any sources of water or where the sources of water were
inadequate;
-  Habitations having no source of water within a distance of 1 mile (11.6 km.)
-  Habitations where source of water was available at more than 50 ft (15m) below
ground level;
-  Habitations where available water was chemically contaminated;
-  Habitations where sources of water were not perennial; and
-  Habitations where water-borne diseases were endemic.
A policy decision was made which stipulated that one bore well for every 250 population be provided
on the assumption that one bore well would yield 10,000 litres per day to meet the demand of 250
persons at the rate of 40 litres per capita per day (Ipcd)
With the introduction of the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programime (ARWSP) in 1972-1973 by
the Government of India with 100% grant-in-aid to the states, greater emphasis was placed on
coverage of difficult habitations in the state. The programme was withdrawn after 1973-1974,
following the introduction of Minimum Needs Programme under the Fifth Five Year Plan. The slow
progress achieved by the states in the supply of safe drinking water to the rural population under the
Minimum Needs Programme led to the reintroduction of ARWSP in 1977-1978.
During the year 1980, at the instance of the Government of India, the state government conducted a
survey to identify problem habitations based on criteria suggested by them. Three categories of
problem habitations were identified:

Category-3.  Habitations where water-borne diseases like chollera, typhoid, gastroenteritis,
guinea-worm etc. were endemic. Accordingly, habitaltions falling under each of the
three categories were identified as on April 1, 1980.
With the Central Government's increasing concern that only the main villages were being served,
while hamlets were neglected, the service levels in hamlets became the next area of policy emphasis.
With the introduction of the concept of hamlets in 1991, a survey was initiated again by the Central
Government to identify problem villages and hamlets surrounding the miain villages.
2.1.1   The Mission approach
With the launching of the National Drinking Water Mission in 1986 (later renamed as Rajiv Gandhi
National Drinking Water Mission in 1991), the policy of coverage of problem habitations was
reinforced with complementary objectives.
*   To cover residual problem habitations as on 01/04/1986
*   To evolve an appropriate technology mix
*   To improve performance and cost effectiveness of the on-going schemes
*   To create awareness among villagers on the use of safe drinking water
*   To take measures for the sustainability of the sources and the! systems.
Other important areas of emphasis of the "Mission Approach" were tackling water quality problems,
sustainability of sources and systems, eradication of guinea worm infestation, etc., under the Sub-
Mission on Water Quality. This kind of an approach and policy emphasis continued till 1998.
With this background as per the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Raj Act, 1993, the operation and maintenance
of Rural Water Supply Schemes is now one of the statutory responsibilities of VPs. In keeping with
the provisions of the Act, the GoTN has transferred the operation and maintenance of all Mini Water
Supply Schemes (MWS) and Piped Water Supply (PWS) Schemes to the VPs. The responsibility for
the maintenance of all hand pumps has been vested with the TPs to ensure econQmies of scale and
also to ensure that trained manpower is easily available. Such partial cost sharing Is also proposed to
be withdrawn, making the VPs responsible for meeting 100% O&M cost by collecting user charges
through Village Water and Sanitation Committees.
The policy of promoting the 'user pays' principle is gaining momentum in the externally-aided and
Government of India backed RWSS project (the World Bank assisted Integrated Rural Water Supply
& Environmental Sanitation, the Netherlands and the DANIDA aided Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Project) in the State, wherein capital cost sharing by the beneficiaries has been introduced.
The year 1998 marked a radical shift in approach when the Central Government issued a new set of
'Guidelines for Implementation of Rural Water Supply Programme'. The new guidelines marked a
"qualitative shift from a supply driven approach to a demand responsive approach" which also
constitutes the basic tenets of GoTN's water supply policy.
2.1.2   Tenth Five Year Plan - Water supply and Sanitation policy
During successive plan periods, water supply sector has received high priority which is reflected in the
impressive coverage achieved so far. In respect of sanitation, both allocation and coverage were quite
inadequate. With fast urbanisation and increasing expectancy of the people, the scarcity of resources
and also the widening gap between demand and supply make the task ahead for the State a
challenging one.

The areas to be covered under Water Supply and Sanitation are
(i) Rural areas and (ii) Urban areas.
The main Objectives of the Tenth Five Year Plan would be as under:
Rural Water Supply:
.  Full coverage of all the rural habitations in the State with a minimum of 40 Ipcd supply
and 55 lpcd where ever possible
*  Full and independent coverage of habitations where socially marginalised groups live.
.  Sustainability of the systems and sources
*  Water quality monitoring and surveillance through a Catchment Area approach.
*  Cost effective technology to the quality affected habitations
.  Introduction of dual water supply schemes
.  On site treatment
*  House Service Connections
*  Adoption of demand driven approach, user participation and cost recovery
.  Coverage of schools, anganvadis, noon meal centres and primary health centres with
water supply
*  Awareness campaign on the use of safe drinking water, water conserfation, ground
water management
.  Redefining the role of Government! Governmental agencies from 'provider' to 'facilitator'
*  Rain water harvesting, establishment of ground water recharge structures for source
sustainability
Water Security: One of the important objectives of the Government of Tamil Nadu during the Tenth
Five Year Plan Period is Water Security. Hence, provision of safe drinking water to the people of the
State will be accorded the top most priority by the Government. Moreover, 'drinking water security'
and safe disposal of waste water are indispensable elements for achieving 'health security' and
'ecological security' forming part of the Chief Minister's 15 Points Programme.
Coverage and Service Level: The Government of Tamil Nadu has adopted a policy of providing at
least 40 Ipcd of water supply and 55 Ipcd wherever possible. All Partially Covered Habitations (PCs),
i.e., habitations with present water supply level less than 40 lpcd are to be upgraded to the supply
level of at least 40 Ipcd in 5 years from the commencement of the proposed project. Further, all
Partially Covered Habitations as well as Fully Covered Habitations (FCs) are tc be provided with
water free from quality problems meeting the water quality prescribed by the Government of India.
Order of Priority: Habitations with severe deficit in water supply level as well as the habitations
facing acute quality problem shall be accorded the highest priority. The remaining habitations are
proposed to be covered as per norms following a Demand Responsive Approach so as to achieve the
goal of coverage of all the habitations in 5 years from the commencement of the proposed project.
Selection of Sources: Ground water sources free from quality problems are to be given highest
preference as sources for rural water supply schemes. Concurrently, appropriate ground water
recharge measures will be implemented to promote sustainability of source. Surface sources,
wherever available are to be considered particularly in areas where ground wvater sources are
severely affected with quality problems. Problematic hard-core areais may be cfovered with multi-

village schemes. The per capita capital cost and the 0 & M cost are to be the gu ding factors in the
selection of sources and in designing schemes keeping in view the comimunity pref, ,rence
Sustainability of Sources: Ground water recharge measures shall be adopted near all ground water
sources of Piped and Mini Water Supply schemes as part of water supply projects. Up to 20% of
funds for the water supply sector shall be allocated for such measures in the case of existing Piped
and Mini Water Supply Schemes. In this context, the following medium and long-term measures will
be considered.
.  To regulate indiscriminate groundwater withdrawal by enaicting appropriatei legislation;
.  To protect resources against quality degradation;
*  To adopt appropriate measures for augmenting recharge of ground water aquifers;
*  To resort to watershed development programmes aimed at soil and Water conservation
by arresting the run-off;
.  To resort to desiltation of the tank and reservoir systems of the State and catchment
area development through micro-watershed management;
.  To resort to afforestation of deforested areas;
*  To conserve water through rainwater harvesting wherever possible.
Rain Water Harvesting: In order to augment the water supply status particularly in rural areas, the
Government has passed an order no. 672 dated 11th Oct 2002, making it compulsory for provision of
Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) structures in all the buildings. In particular, it was rdeired to harvest
every drop of the surface runoff in the expanded program by maintaining all the traditional water
sources like temple tanks, ponds, PWD tanks, Ooranis, farm ponds and provision of RWH structures
along the NH, SH and Panchayat minor roads. The achievement is reported to be pearly 100% as on
31-12-2003 and appreciable improvement is reported in the rural areas, particularly in temple tanks
and Ooranis.
The Delivery System: The State Government will promote and facilitate participation of the NGOs
and the private sector and enable Panchayat Raj Institutions and user communities to take on a lead
role in decision-making. VPs shall be the nodal agencies for water supply manag ment. The actual
construction of water supply schemes shall be carried out through private sector contractors or
Government agencies like TWAD. The VPs and the village water supply and sanitation committees
(VWSSC) shall be actively involved in planning and executing the water supply schemes with the
entire responsibility of O&M resting with the beneficiary community.
2.1.3   Rural Sanitation:
The State policy on rural sanitation will focus on the following aspects.
*  Shift from allocation based approach to demand driven approach
*  Coverage of the rural population with individual/cluster toilets
*  Abolition of manual scavenging by converting dry latrines into pour flush latrines
*  Safe disposal of domestic liquid and solid waste integrated with disposal of night soil
*  Coverage of rural schools with sanitation facilities
*  Intensive IEC campaign and human resource development
*  Facilitating setting up of Rural Sanitary Marts at nearest points
*  Introduction of cost effective technologies in the construction of sanitary facilities

*  Soft loans through institutional finance for the constructiorl of rural latrines
*  Extending house service connections in the rural areas
2.2     Environmental aspects in the National Water Policy (2002)
Recognising that water is a prime natural resource, a basic human need and a precious national
asset, the policy provides for the following guidelines in planning andl operation of water resources
projects as relevant in the context of the proposed project.
.  "Water is a scarce and precious national resource to be planned, developed and
conserved as such, and on an integrated and environmentally sound basis, keeping in
view the needs of the States concerned."
*  "Water should be made available to water short areas by transfer from other areas
including transfers from one river basin to another, based on a national perspective, after
taking into account the requirements of the areas / basins."'
*  "Water resource development projects should, as far as possible, be planned and
developed as multipurpose projects. Provision for drinking water should be a primary
consideration. The projects should provide for irrigation, flood mitigation, hydro-electric
power generation, navigation, pisciculture and recreation wherever possible."
*  "The study of the impact of a project, during construction and later, on human lives,
settlements, occupations, economic and other aspects should be an essential
component of project planning."
*  "In the planning, implementation and operation of projects, the preservation of the quality
of environment and the ecological balance should be a primary consideration. The
adverse impact, if any, on the environment should be minimised and should be off-set by
adequate compensatory measures."
*  "There should be an integrated and multi-disciplinary approach to the planning,
formulation, clearance and implementation of projects, including catchment treatment
and management, environmental and ecological aspects, the rehabilitation of affected
people and command area development."
.  "Special efforts should be made to investigate and formulate projects either in or for the
benefit of areas inhabited by tribal or other specially disadvantaged groups such as
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. In other areas also, project planning should
pay special attention to the needs of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other
weaker sections of society."
*  "In the planning and operation of systems, water allocation priorities should be broadly
as follows:
-   Drinking water
-   Irrigation
-   Hydro-power
-   Navigation
-   Industrial and other uses
However, these priorities might be modified, if necessary, in particular regions with reference
to area specific considerations."
* "There should be a close integration of water-use and land-use policies."

2.2.1   Environmental Requirements of Government of India on RWSS Projects
The Government of India through Ministry of Environment and Forests, requires environmental
clearance of any infrastructure Projects, which cost more than Rs. 100 crore (US$ 20 million) or if they
are mentioned under Schedule I (list) of Environmental Protection Act of 1986. The schedule I
mentions 30 categories of activities/projects that require an environmental clearance from the MoEF.
However, RWSS projects are generally small in investments size (less than US$20 million), project
areas not notified as ecologically sensitive/fragile and are not listed under the schedule 1, therefore,
do not require environmental clearance either from the State or from Central Government.
As per MoEF notification of 19th February, 1991 (as amended upto 3rd October, 2001) declaring
coastal stretches as Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and regulating activities in the CRZ, one of the
activities, among others, declared as prohibited within the coastal regulation zone relates to
"harvesting or drawal of groundwater and construction of mechanisms therefore within 200m of HTL;
in the 200m to 500m zone it shall be permitted when done manually through ordinary wells for
drinking, horticulture, agriculture and fisheries:
Provided that drawl of groundwater is permitted, where no other source of water is available and
when done manually through ordinary wells or hand pumps, for drinking and domestic purposes, in
the zone between 50-200m from HTL in case of rivers, creeks and backwaters subject to such
restrictions as may be deemed necessary in areas affected by sea water intrusion, that may be
imposed by an authority designated by State Government / Union Territory Administration (item X of
para 2 of the Notification).
Specifically, there are no State level clearances required for the proposed project from environmental
considerations other than in cases where the proposed abstraction of water from a river source in the
proposed project exceeds 1 MGD. In such cases, the Water Utilisation Committee set up by the
Government has to accord its approval.
Though the State of Tamil Nadu is dotted with a number of sites of religious and historical importance,
cultural properties, heritage sites, wildlife and bird sanctuaries, the proposed TNRWSS project is not
expected to have any adverse impact on these sites.
The proposed TNRWSS project does not fall under any of the project categories listed in schedule-1
of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification and hence does not require any formal
environmental clearance of the MoEF, Gol. Neither the project area has been notified as ecologically
sensitive / fragile under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.
Environmental laws relevant to the proposed project include:

2.3     State Water Policy
Tamil Nadu is one of the earliest states to have in place a water policy of its own. Formnulated within
the overall framework of the National Water Policy (1987), the state policy came into being in 1994.
The National Water Policy has since been revised in keeping with the developmepts on the subject,
and the new policy approved by the Parliament came into force in 2002.
In the light of the National Water Policy 2002, the GoTN has also undertaken an exercise in the
revision of its State Water Policy, which is awaiting the approval of the Legislative Assembly. The
policy in its present form has an abridged version and an explanatory version.
The broad objectives of the Tamil Nadu State Water Policy are to:
1.   Establish a Management Information System (MIS) for water iresources.
2.   Ensure preservation and stabilisation of existing water resources.
3.   Plan for augmentation of utilisable water resources.
4.   Promote research and training facilities for water resources management.
5.   Establish allocation priorities for water use by different sectors with provision of drinking
water being of highest priority.
6.   Maximise multi-purpose benefit from surface and ground water, land and pther resources.
7.   Provide adequate water for domestic users.
8.   Maximise hydro-power generation within the constraints imposed by other water users.
9.   Provide adequate water for industry.
10. Preserve and enhance the economic fisheries.
11. Maintain water quality to established standards.
12. Promote equity and social justice among users of water for irrigation and domestic water
supplies.
13. Plan for economic and financial sustainability based upon the principle that those who
benefit from projects and programmes should also pay for them.
14. Provide flood protection and drainage
15. Promote users participation in all aspects of water planning and management.

16. Provide mechanisms for the resolution of conflicts between users within and between intra-
state river basins.
The Policy, which will apply to all the water resources in the State, hais also outlined an Action Plan
and identified the institutional framework for implementation.
The Action Plan makes specific reference to the following important aspects:
*  Regulation and control of ground and surface water on a sound legal footing with
appropriate legislations
*  Various technological and administrative steps for maximizing the benefits from the
available water resources.
*  Adoption of various methods for augmentation of water resources.
*  Maintenance of surface and ground water quality through pollution prevention and
regulation of ground water abstraction so as to prevent sea water intrusion.
*  Preparation of drought management plan for each river basin.
*  Promoting beneficiary participation to water use including definition of their rights and
duties
*  Review and rationalization of water rates for different sectors.
2.3.1   Review of State Water Policy
The explanatory version of Tamil Nadu Water Policy, in its overview, has brought out the need for the
State Policy in the backdrop of variations in the physiographic, agro-climatic and topographic features
of the State vis-a-vis the country as a whole. The policy also takes into consideration the water
resources of the State and its specific needs.
From a review and analysis of the Tamil Nadu State Water Policy the following observations would
seem relevant.
*  The philosophy and the broad contents of the State Water Policy are in consonance with
that contained in the National Water Policy.
*  In the abridged version of the Policy (Item 8) artificial recharging of ground water has
been identified, and rightly so, as an important means of augmentation of water
resources.
*  In keeping with the policy statement (Item 36) 'suitable legislation for preventing over
extraction of groundwater, which will lead to salt water intrusion in coastal areas and
drying up of the existing wells in other area be enacted and implemented.' It is to the
credit of the GoTN that the Tamil Nadu Groundwater (Development & Management) Bill
2003 has been passed and that the Act is to be formally notified. Strict enforcement of
the legal provisions will go a long way in remedying the present situation.
*  Two issues of relevance in the context of water resources management for possible
inclusion in the State Policy relate to
1. Large scale illegal sand mining in all the rivers in the State which has seriously
affected the quantity and quality of surface and sub-surface water resources
through out the State, and
2. Recent disputes / debates regarding structural safety of existing dams which were
constructed several decades ago.

2.4     Tamil Nadu State Acts related to Water sector
2.4.1   The Tamil Nadu Groundwater (Development & Management) Act, 2003
The Government of Tamil Nadu has drafted a legislation to protect Groundwater resources, to provide
safeguards against hazards of its over exploitation and to ensure its planned development and proper
management in the State of Tamil Nadu. This Act, called the Tamil Nadu Groundwater (Development
& Management) Act, 2003 extends to the whole of the state. A copy of the Act is at in Annex 2.1. The
Act, however, is yet to be notified.
The proposed Act is based on the single most important premise that a change in the ground water
regime is caused only due to pumping whether it is for irrigation, industrial use or commercial
purposes. However, the surface/ sub surface flow in the rivers also has a direct bearing on the ground
water regime. Some of the environmental aspects that may have environmental implications on
Ground water availability and discharge but not covered under the Ground Water Act,, include - the
impact of widely prevalent illegal sand mining operations in the rivers,, the impact dues to disposal of
rejects from water desalination processes especially in areas severely affected by high TDS / salinity
(such as in Ramanathapuram district),
2.4.2   Chennai Metropolitan Area Groundwater (Regulation) Act No.27 of 1987
This Act authorises the Chennai Metropolitan water Supply and Sewerage Board to prohibit drilling
new wells in the designated area unless the user first obtains a permit from the Board and to prepare
a register of all existing wells. As per this Act, pre-existing users, except agricultural users, must apply
for a license within 15 days of the date of the Act. All new users must obtain a license from the Board.
This Act directs the government to issue instructions to the Board on the implementation of an
artificial recharge scheme. This Act grants the Board powers to adopt regulations to prevent seawater
intrusion.
2.4.3   Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act
As per Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Act, TN Act No.28 of 1978, as modified
upto 31st August 1981, the Board has powers over construction, drilling and alterihg of wells, ponds,
tanks and cisterns providing drinking water and the power to regulate, control and charge for existing
or future use of groundwater for all purposes except irrigation, in the Chennai Metropolitan Area.
2.4.4   Tamil Nadu Panchayat Act No.35 of 1958, as amended
This Act prescribes the purpose and manner of organising Village and Town FPanchayats. It
authorises the Panchayats to construct and repair various small water related structures. This Act
allows the Government to transfer to Panchayats the duty of protectinc and maintaining any irrigation
works or regulate distribution of water.
2.4.5   Tamil Nadu Rivers Conservation Act No.6 1884 as amended in 1969
As per this Act, the State Government can declare a river or parts thereof to be subject to
conservation measures in designated areas.

2.4.6   Water Utilisation Committee
In GO MS No. 2039 PWD dated 06-11-1979; the Government constituted the Water Utilisation
Committee and directed that all water supply schemes costing over Rs. 10 lakhs (not less than 1
MGD) and all Medium Irrigation Schemes costing Rs. 25 lakhs and above should be placed before
the committee which will consider the schemes and make its recommendations to the Government
with respect to the utilisation of water resources for irrigation, drinking water and industrial purposes.
In GO MS No. 700 PWD (WR2) Department dated 18-10-1996, the Water Utilisation Committee was
reconstituted and the Government directed that all water supply involving drawal of water of 1 MGD
(4.5 MLD) and above be placed before the said Committee for consideration and cl ararice.
2.4.7   Regulations and procedures
Palar basin rules: The Palar basin rules which came into existence since pre-independent period
have been amended from time to time and are in operation even today. The purpose arid objective of
this regulatory instrument is to arrest unhealthy trend in the exploitation of groundwater along the river
course. The Rules as amended under GO MS No. 1766 PWD dated 31-10-1988 stipulate as follows:
1. The distance rules (distance between wells and river banks) slhall be 200mn and this distance
has to be computed from the banks of the river.
2. Only those survey fields which come within the prohibited distance of 200m (and not the
entire village) be subjected to Palar Basin Rules.
3. The fields abutting spring heads or channels which were earlier in existence but now dried up
should not be subject to the Rules.
4. The Collectors of the respective districts are authorised to decide as to which of these spring
heads or channels have become defunct.
5. The names of the villages that will attract the Palar Basin Rules shall be exhibited on the
notice boards of the Government and Panchayat union offices. Applications seeking Palar
basin certificates should also be disposed expeditiously.
So as to identify the specific area where Palar Basin Rules have to be implemented, the district
Collectors concerned have listed out the fields (survey number wise) which fall within 200m from
the banks of Palar river.
Standing orders of the Board of Revenue: The orders established rates for assessment for
those lands receiving water from a government source. It prescribes right to utilise diffused

* The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) enforces the enactment on
Environment and other Pollution Control Acts. As per GO MS No. 213 (ECI) Department
dated 30-03-1989 Environment & Forests, no new industry is to be sited within 1 km from
water sources. Annexure 1 to this GO gives the list of industries for Mhich total ban has
been imposed for location of industries from the embankment of he water sources
mentioned in Annexure 2. The TNPCB will examine the caises and obt in the approval of
Government for setting up highly polluting industries from water sources, other than
mentioned in Annexure 2. The TNPCB has prescribed eifluent standards in BP MS 30
TNSCP dated 21-02-1984. The Government reconsidered this GO regarding locating
new industries near water sources and it has been modified from 1km to 5km.
Government order MS No. 127 Environment & Forests dated 08-05-1 988 states that "no
new industries (Red category type) will be sited within 5kmr radius from water sources."
2.5     Status of TNRWSS Project from Environmental Considerations
The proposed TNRWSS project does not fall under any of the project categories listed in schedule-1
of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification and hence does not require any formal
environmental clearance of the MoEF, Gol. Neither the project area has been notified as ecologically
sensitive / fragile under the Environment Protection Act, 1986.
As per MoEF notification of 1 9th February, 1991 (as amended upto 3rd October, 2001) declaring
coastal stretches as Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) and regulating activities in the CRZ, one of the
activities, among others, declared as prohibited within the coastal regulation zone relates to
"harvesting or drawal of groundwater and construction of mechanisms therefore within 200m of HTL;
in the 200m to 500m zone it shall be permitted when done manually through ordinary wells for
drinking, horticulture, agriculture and fisheries:
Provided that drawal of groundwater is permitted, where no other source of water is available and
when done manually through ordinary wells or handpumps, for drinking and domestic purposes, in the
zone between 50-200m from HTL in case of rivers, creeks and backwaters subject to such restrictions
as may be deemed necessary in areas affected by sea water intrusion, that may be imposed by an
authority designated by State Government / Union Territory Administration (item X of para 2 of the
Notification).
Specifically, there are no State level clearances required for the proposed project from environmental
considerations other than in cases where the proposed abstraction of water from a river source in the
proposed project exceeds 1 MGD. In such cases, the Water Utilisation Committee set up by the
Government has to accord its approval.
Though the State of Tamil Nadu is dotted with a number of sites of religious and historical importance,
cultural properties, heritage sites, wildlife and bird sanctuaries, the proposed TNRWSS project is not
expected to have any adverse impact on these sites.

TWAD Board: A state level laboratory at Chennai, established in '1964, and now fully equipped
with the most modern facilities for complete analysis of water samples f r all parameters
including trace metals and organics. This is the first Government laboratory of its kind in the
country obtain the ISO 9002 certification. In addition there are:
*  District laboratories in each of the twenty eight districts in the State.
*  One mobile laboratory at Coimbatore.
*  Six laboratories located at major water works operated and maintained by the TWAD
Board.   These laboratories have facilities to concluct physical, chemical and
bacteriological examination of water, sewage and pollution samples
The TWAD laboratories focus on the assessment of potability of new sources, and monitoring and
control of water supply schemes maintained by the TWAD Board. A number of monitoring and
surveillance works are also undertaken including performance evaluation of treat"ment plans. Water
samples from hand pumps and power pumps are tested and certified regarding their potability. The
water sources are systematically monitored by analyzing the quallity of water in a network of
observation wells spread over the entire State. On an average, about 10,000 samnples per year are
tested in these laboratories.
The water quality data from the district laboratories is collected and compiled at the TWAD Head
Office. Water quality maps are prepared and communicated for field use. The Deputy Chief Water
Analyst unit at the Head Office co-ordinates the various activities of water quality management in the
TWAD Board.
TNPCB: The Board has established the following laboratories to assist in the analytical and
scientific work:
o Three - Advanced Environmental Labs (AEL) at Chennai, IMadurai and Salem
*  Six - District Environmental Labs (DEL) at Ambattur, Vellore and Cuddalore
*  Three - Mobile Environmental Labs (MEL) at Hosur, Manali, Trichy, Thirunelveli,
Coimbatore and Dindigul.
The main focus of the TNPCB Laboratories is on testing of pollution samples and other ambient water
quality monitoring programs, their own or sponsored.
The AELs, DELs and MELs of TNPCB have different levels of monitoring and analytical capabilities
which depend on the range of instruments these laboratories are equipped with. In general, the AELs
have better facilities and are capable of monitoring and analysis of wider range of environmental
parameters than the DELs and MELs. The AELs are the best equipped laboratories of the TNPCB
and can analyze all physical, chemical and biological parameters for water and waste water samples.
PH Laboratories: The Public Health laboratories at the King Institute in Chennai and in Coimbatore
monitor the water quality in major water supply schemes of Rural Town Panchayals and Urban Town
Panchayats in the State. It is an independent surveillance and monitoring agency, which has the
statutory obligation to report to the Government any lapses in drinking water quality from urban and

The PWD, Ground Water laboratories undertake monitoring ground Water samples collected from a
network of over 2000 observation wells in the State. Samples are analysed to establish suitability or
otherwise of water quality for water supply and irrigation needs. It provides data to the Chief Engineer
for planning ground water development schemes for the entire State.
It may be noted from the above that the objective, scope, capabilities of and the available
infrastructural facilities with the various institutions engaged in water quality monitoring in Tamil Nadu
are varied. Further, there is a lack co-ordination between these organizations. More importantly,
there is no established mechanism for dissemination and exchange of information / data generated by
the various agencies engaged in water quality monitoring between the producers and the users for
effective planning and management of water resources in the State.
3.3     Analysis of Institutional Aspects
Presently the TWAD Board is the major agency for planning, implementing and commissioning of all
RWS schemes in Tamil Nadu. The schemes include HP / PP / CWSS, in addition special programs
such as tackling water quality problems, water supply facilities to SC, / ST are also undertaken by
TWAD. In the recent years, major activities towards implementation of number of CWSS are
undertaken. Funds for this program are received from Gol / HUDCO / L-IC / GoTN. Particular attention
is given for upgrading the existing facilities from partially completed to fully completed. However, the
above programs are implemented based on supply driven approach and at no sta9e the villagers are
involved in this task. In respect of rural sanitation program, TWAD Board's role is practically nil.
The Directorate of Rural Development, who are responsible for all the rural activities are also involved
in providing water supply to rural community in a limited way in the form of HP / PP / Extension
Pipelines (EPL) based on the immediate needs of the villagers. The above activities are implemented
by engineers who are working in the DRD. Funds for these activities are received under Rural
Development Fund as a grant. In addition to the above, under the IEleventh Finance Commission
grant, Gol releases funds for implementing RWS programs in a limited 'way namely, PP / EPL etc. The
above activities are taking place for the past 2 years. RWS activities are also und rtaken with MLA /
MP local area development fund. But the above programs are implemented more or less on an adhoc
basis, without any technical assessment. Further co-ordination between DRD & TWAD, who are the
implementing agencies for the rural water supply schemes in the State needs improvement.
The GoTN policy on rural water supply and sanitation places emphasis on 'demand-based' delivery
system with a decentralised approach, vesting the planning and decision-making authority on the
beneficiary Village Panchayat. This new dispensation would call for the backup support of a
technically strong and competent agency, which can guide the HWSC in all technical matters and
facilitate decision-making. In the proposed institutional framework, this role is to be taken up by the
Manager (Technical) of the Technical Wing under the direct supervision of the District Program
Manager (DPM) and supported by a team of Deputy Managers and Technical Officers. It is presumed
that the existing TWAD Board engineers will be re-deployed in these positions. Thus, the HWSC will
have the benefit of the rich experience of TWAD Board engineers in managing water supply systems.
In this context, the beneficiary community should also have the option of identifying andl engaging the
services of an independent agency such as an NGO or a consultant who is competent enough in the
effective delivery of such services.
The planning, design, construction and 0 & M of multi-village water supply schemqs present complex
situations and call for a specialised dispensation for the management of such sqhemes. There are
already such schemes implemented by TWAD in Tamil Nadu. These are operated and maintained
also by TWAD. The valuable experience of this agency could be utilised in the planning and

implementation of new schemes in the proposed project. Here again, the beneficiary community
should be free to avail the option of engaging any other competent agency for the in~tended service.
In the proposed TNRWSS project, the entire responsibility for the O&M of water supply scheme would
be that of the beneficiary community / HWSC. It is well known that the HWSCs do not have the
necessary technical backup support to operate and maintain the systern in an efficient manner. In this
backdrop, the policy framework should make it mandatory for the construction agency to impart hands
on training in the routine O&M of the facilities to the persons identified by the HWSCs before handing
over the facilities to the community. Also, a minimum running in period should be prescribed during
which deficiencies, if any, noticed in the system should be rectified.
Presently, there is no regular system of water quality monitoring in respect of schemes for which the
O & M responsibility rests with the local body. In the proposed demand driven projects also the
present situation is likely to continue as this aspect may receive the lowest priority by the owner
community, which needs to be addressed. A mutually acceptable arrangement malybe worked out by
which the owners of community water supply systems will be required to have in place a minimum
program of water quality monitoring and the existing labs will provide the service which will be
affordable by the community. In this context, the role of other existing institutions such as the King
Institute, which have a mandate for routine water quality surveillaince needs to be addressed.

4.3     Analysis of Water and Sanitation Technology Options proposed under the project
4.3.1   Water supply
Rehabilitation of existing schemes: With the encouraging response, as evidenced during the
public consultations, for participation of people including financial contribution for better water and
sanitation services, the demand for the proposed TNRWSS project could be expected to be
significant. The detailed investigation and engineering evaluation of all existing assets (existing
sources, treatment and distribution systems, pumps and pumping machinery etc.) already created
under various programs and preparation of a rehabilitation plan to ensure their functionality and
optimum utilisation would be useful
Source identification / selection: The proposed project would require, in most of the cases,
identification of new sources so as to improve the existing service levels. As 90 - 93% of surface
water resources have already been utilised, the scope of using surface water res urces for RWS in
the state could be limited. In addition, illegal sand mining and pollution due to dis harge of industrial
and municipal wastes have aggravated the situation in many river basins. This me ans that more and
more of ground water only have to be tapped for water supply. As, by and large, |ocal sources have
already been tapped, it may become inevitable to look for distant new sources. Such sources may be
outside the administrative boundary of the beneficiary village. Tapping such sources may also lead to
conflict of interests between villages with competing demands.
Presently more than 95 % of rural water supply schemes are based on ground water source. From
economic considerations, it is a widely accepted practice that if ground water of potable quality
(without the need for treatment) is available in adequate quantity, it should be the fiirst priority for
selection. In the context of the proposed project, there are many halbitations which experience the
problem of water scarcity, water quality or both. Though some of the! existing groundwater sources
have failed due to varied reasons including lowering of water table, distant potentia I sources will have
to be identified.
In the search for new groundwater sources, the latest tools and techniques like satellite imageries and
geophysical methods such as electromagnetic profiling and electrical riesistivity soundings etc. should
be resorted to so as to improve the success rate. In this context, the extensive state-wide information
generated by Anna University in the form of groundwater recharge zonation maps could provide a
basis for identifying potential sites for new sources as well.
While looking for new groundwater sources, the following risk elements should be recognised. In
sum, all efforts would be made to ensure the sustainability of the source in the proposed TNRWSS
project. Once the source has been identified, water conservation measures such as rain water
harvesting and ground water recharge would be considered 'a must' for promoting the sustainability of
the source.
Rainwater harvesting for direct use: Though not directly relalted to improving the source
sustainability, will have an indirect impact in that the demand on the source to that extent will be
reduced. It may be noted here that as per a Tamil Nadu G.O. installation of rainwater harvesting
structures in all existing and new buildings to come up in the State is mandatory.

If feasibility of ground water is ruled out, alternate surface sources (village tanks / rivers / streams/
canals) which will require only simple treatment such as slow sand filtration, river 0 tank bed filtration
will be considered. Such surface source based systems may be designed to cater to the needs of a
group of villages / habitations in order to have the benefit of economies of scale. The capital cost of
such multi-village schemes, however, will be high as also the recurring cost. This aspect may be
crucial in the decision making by the target community regarding the need for proposed project. In
such cases, on the basis of an objective assessment, appropriate modifications in the policy of cost
sharing may have to be considered to ensure the sustainability of the system.
Source water quality: As discussed elsewhere in the report, water quality hos been a serious
problem in several parts of the State. The major quality problems pertain to the chernical quality -
caused due to the presence of excessive concentrations of fluoride, TD)S, Nitrate, and Chloride and in
some cases Iron. Some of these constituents have serious public health implications while others
have aesthetic significance. Thus, the risk of rejectiorn of such sources by the community is very high.
In respect of maintaining water quality and its standards, the villagers at best can identify the colour,
odour and taste parameters in water quality. Beyond the above paranneters, the villagers will not be
able to identify any serious water quality problems without any assistance. Similarly, the villagers role
in preventing sand mining, dumping of solid wastes is only limited. Hence, it may not be possible for
the villagers to monitor and take necessary steps for ensuring supply of water free from pollution etc.
as per the prevailing conditions.
There have also been instances where the water quality was acceptable when the source was
commissioned, but over the years gradually deteriorated resulting in the abandoning of the source.
Water Treatment: Experiences abound in the country to show that water treatment systems installed
in rural areas for removal of excess fluoride or iron have not been successful for a variety of reasons.
Huge investments made in such systems have become wasted. In the light Qf this experience,
treatment for quality problem in ground water should be the last option. Preference should be given to
surface / sub-surface sources, even if they have to be tapped from long distances.
In situations where it becomes inevitable to go in for expensive treatment tec nologies such as
defluoridisation and desalination for quality affected habitations, it may even be necessary to go in for
dual water supply i.e., limited supply of safe drinking water and supply of secon grade quality for
other uses than drinking and cooking.

Operation and Maintenance: In existing rural water supply systems, lack of efficient 0 & M has been
reported as a major cause of failure of the systems. In the proposedl demand driven approach, the
entire responsibility for 0 & M of the assets created will rest with the beneficiary community.
Sanitation options: A major issue of environmental concern in all the districts / VPs is the lack of
household sanitation systems (latrines). The present level of coverage in the prcject districts is low
when compared to the state level coverage of 14%. Open air defecation is almo st universal in the
project districts with its associated environmental and public health risks. This practice is also a major
cause of soil and surface water contamination. Thus, there is an ur(gent need fc ir provision of safe
sanitation systems in these villages to minimise the public health risks due to the prevailing
unhygienic practices. The programmes launched by the state under the 'Nirmala G rama Yojana', the
'Swachcha Grama Yojana' and the centrally assisted programmes are yet to n lake a significant
impact on sanitation coverage in the project districts.
The nature of soils encountered in the different districts varies from plaice to place. During field visits,
it was observed that the type of soil varies considerably even within the same village / habitation. In
districts with black cotton soils, which have high water holding capacity and do not allow percolation of
water when wet, special provisions have to be made. Conventional selptic tanks in these soils will not
only prove expensive but also pose difficulties in the disposal of the effluent. Apart frorrm this, it is also
necessary to identify appropriate latrine models for water logged areas, particularly in command
areas.
In almost all the villages visited in the sample VPs, there is scope for provision of individual household
latrines in some parts of the village. In other parts with thick clusters of houses, ownership based
group latrines may be appropriate.
It is common to see in most of the villages in the project districts, sullage being lot on to the streets.
This practice results in the streets remaining slushy and dirty most of the time even during dry
seasons. This problem gets aggravated during monsoons, especially in areas withi black cotton soil,
resulting in pools of stagnant sullage. These create unsightly conditions, cause hindrance to smooth
movement of people and vehicles and also serve as veritable breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The
situation may become still worse with improvement in water supply service levels.

5       Baseline Environmental Status
5.1     Physical Environment
5.1.1   Location
The state of Tamil Nadu lies between North Latitudes 8°00' and 13°30' and East Lohgitudes 76015'
and 80°18'. It is bounded on the western side by Kerala, North by Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh
states, East by Bay of Bengal sea and on the South by the Indian Ocean. The total geographical area
of the State is 1,30,058 sq. km. of which 21,407.24 sq. km is under forest cover. Tamil Nadu is
administratively divided into 30 districts, 206 taluks and 385 blocks. The location map and the block
boundary of Tamil Nadu are given in Figs 5.1 & 5.2 respectively. The total number of revenue villages
in the State is 17,274.
5.1.2   Physiography
Physiographically, Tamil Nadu is divided into four regions, viz., 1. The Coastal Plains 2. The Eastern
Ghats 3. The Central Plateau and 4. The Western Ghats.
The Coastal plains: The coastal plain stretches from Pulicat lake to Kanyakumari, over a idistance of
about 998 km. The elevation ranges between 2 m and 30 m above the mean sea level (MSL).
The Eastern Ghats: The Eastern Ghats is a chain of flat-topped hills, namely "th Javadis", "the
Shervaroy", "the Kalrayan" and "the Pachamalais" located in between Palar and Cauvery rivers. The
Eastern Ghats continue further west and join with the Western Ghats at Nilgiris. Th q Eastern Ghats
rise steeply to the level of 11 60m above MSL in Javadis and to 1,645 M above MSL i the Shervaroy
hills.
The Central Plateau: The "Central Plateau" lies in between Eastern and Western Ghats, consisting of the
districts of Erode and Coimbatore.
The Western Ghats: On the western fringe of the plateau, a hill range, known as W stern Ghats is
situated. The broad Palghat gap is located in between the Nilgiris on the north and A namalai, Palani
and Cardamom hills on the south. The Nilgiris form a compact plateau of about 2569 sq. km. with a
summit level of 1830 to 2440m above MSL. Anamalai is the highest peak of the Penins ula.
5.1.3   Climate and rainfall
Generally, a sub-tropical climate prevails throughout the State and there is no sharp variation in
climate. Tamil Nadu has four distinct seasons viz: Cool weather (Winter), (January C February); Hot
weather (Summer), (March - May); South-west Monsoon, (June - September); North East Monsoon
(October - December).
Temperature: The temperature slowly rises to its maximum in summer till Mlay and afte wards shows a
general decline. The maximum temperature ranges from 37°C to 43°C and the minim im temperature
from 120C to 170C. The mean daily temperature during May (Summer) varies from 30'C to 340C. The
mean daily temperature during October (Winter) varies from 260C to 290C.
During May (Summer) the average relative humidity varies from 40% to 70%. During October (Winter)
the average relative humidity varies from 60% to 80%.

5.1.4   Geology
The general geological formations in Tamil Nadu range in age from archaeans to recent which control
the occurrence and movement of ground water.
The Crystalline rocks and Crystalline metamorphic rocks comprise the charnockites, granites,
gneisses, khondalites, mixed gneisses with intrusion of Quartz keins, pegmatites, Dolerite-dykes and
Syenites. These Crystalline formations occupy 73 % of the total area in Tamil Nadu, Pinlk and grey
granites are exposed in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Coimbatore, Madurai and Tirunelveli districts.
Gneissic rocks are exposed as flat out-crops in the plain areas and low hills and are highly prone to
weathering. Charnockite is massive and well exposed in the hills of Javadi, Shervaroy, Palani &
Nilgiris (Fig. 5.5).
The sedimentary formations ranging in age from Mesozoic to recent times constitute 27% of the total
area of the State.

5.1.5     Geomorphology (Land forms)
Tamil Nadu, a part of the Peninsular shield is not affected much by endogeneic forces like volcanoes
folding and faulting after Precambian period. Landforms observed over Tamil Nadu have been caused
by the exogeneic agencies like river, wind and ocean. The major landforms are the predominant hills,
plateaus and plain regions.
The various geomorphic units of Fluvial, Aeolian and Coastal land forms and their groundwater
occurrences are given in Table 5.1.

5.1.6     Hydrogeology
For the purpose of describing the hydrogeological conditions of Tamil Nadu, the geological formations
are broadly classified into hard and soft rocks. The hard rock aquifers are heterogeneous in nature as
indicated by the variations in lithology, structure and texture within a short distance and the
occurrence and movement of ground water is controlled by fractures, faults and weathored :zone.
D:\SEA_Draft_Final_Report\SEAMF-DFR.doc                                                                5-6

Ground water occurs in the hard rocks normally under water table conditions in the weathered mantle
and under semi confined conditions in the fractures, fissures and joints. In hard rock terrain generally
open dug wells are the suitable abstraction structures. But, due to alarmingly declining trend of
groundwater levels in the State, bore wells are sunk to greater depths. But, by and large, the
occurrence of ground water in these formations depends on the intensity and depth of weathering,
prevalence of fractures and joints.
The soft rocks or sedimentary formations are generally more suitable for ground water development
by open wells and tube wells in view of their high porosity and permeability. These formations occur in
the coastal tract of the State.
In the sedimentaries, tertiary sandstones and the recent Quaternary alluvium form the potential
aquifer. Artesian aquifers also occur in some parts, namely Neyveli in Cuddalore district and
Jambaiyuthu area of Karaikudi. The aquifers in the Gondwana formations and upper Cretaceous
formations are less productive as compared to the tertiary and quaternarj aquifers in view of the low
porosity and permeability.
5.1.7   Soils
As per the classification of the Soil Survey and Land Use Organization, Government of Tamil Nadu,
the soils of the State have been broadly divided into three types: Red soil, Black soil and Alluvial soils.
Red soil occupies major part of the State (61%). The area occupied by other soil types are Coastal
alluvial soil, River alluvium (24)%, Black soil (12)%, Laterite soil, saline and alkaline soils (3)%. The
distribution of soils in the State is shown in Fig. 5.6.
5.1.8   Land use / Land cover
Tamil Nadu is primarily an agriculture-oriented State. Most of the cultivaition takes place during the
two monsoons namely, NE and SW. Out of the geographical area of 1,30,058 sq.km, area sown in the
normal years is about 42%. Area under forest is 21407.24 sq.km which works out to 16.5%, and land
put to non-agricultural use is 19, 36,896 ha (14.9%). The remaining area of 34,41,803 ha (26.47%) is
waste and fallow lands. The basin-wise land use details are furnished in Table 5.2.

5.2     Water Environment
5.2.1   Water resources of Tamil Nadu
The State is drained by 17 major rivers. Some of them originate in the Western Ghats and flow
eastwards. Besides the east flowing rivers, there are a number of small rivers such as Aliyar,
Sholaiyar and Parambikulam, originating in the Anamalai hills and flowing westwards. The total
number of major reservoirs in the state is 71, in addition there are 39000 big and small tank;s.
(i)     River basins
Tamil Nadu has 17 major river basins namely Chennai, Palar, Varahanadhi, Ponnaiyar, Vellar,
Cauvery, Agniar, Pambar, Kottakarai, Vaigai, Gundar, Vaippar, Kallar, Tambraparani, Nambiyar,
Kodayar and Pollachi (Fig. 5.7). The per capita water resource of Tamil Nadu is 4224.50 m3, which is
much less than the all India figure of 24645 m3. The details regarding the drainage area, rainfall and
basin wise groundwater potential of the river basins are given in Table 5.3. The basin-wise surface
and ground water potential, total water demand and water balance for the year 1994, 1999, 2004 and
projections for the year 2019, 2025, 2044 and 2050 for the river basins of Tamil Nadu (excluding
Cauvery basin) are furnished in Table 5.4.

Of the 1261 TMC (thousand million cubic feet) of surface water annually available, about 1155 TMC
or 92% has been utilised for irrigation, municipal and industrial purposes. The competing demands
between different users and uses have added enormous pressure to groundwater resources. (Source:
Soiled agriculture and spoiled environment: Socio-economic impact of groundwater pollution in Tamil Nadu by S. Janakarajan,
Working paper no. 175, Madras Institute of Development Studies, September, 2002). Out of 16 river basins, 5 basins
namely Palar, Varahanadhi, Paravanar, Vaippar and Kodaiar are the only surplus basins. The
remaining 11 river basins are rated as deficit basins. The surplus flow from each basin into the sea is
given in Table. 5.5.

For major / medium water supply projects in Tamil Nadu, both urban as well as rural, sources are
tapped from the nearby river basins. The district wise details of the typie of sources for RWS are
presented in Table 5.6. Since the abstraction is from sub-soil water, no imajor treatrm ent is involved
except chlorination. However, in certain cases where the water is drawn from the s jrface sources,
conventional treatment works are installed for treating water. The district-wise distribution of rural
water supply sources both ground water and surface water is shown in Fig 5.8.

5.2.2   Groundwater resources potential
Groundwater has emerged as an important and indispensable resource in the absence of adequate
surface water resource to meet the various sectoral demands like irrigation, domestic and industries.
In Tamil Nadu, nearly 95% of surface water resources have been fully utilised and groundwater
resources have become the only alternative source for further developmental programme. This
groundwater resource is also becoming scarce due to the vagaries of monsoon and uncontrolled
exploitation.
Estimation of groundwater resources in Tamil Nadu has been carried out by the SG&SWR Data
Centre of PWD and CGWB, South-eastern region, MOWR, Gol based on the revised methodology of
GWREC-1 997. The status of groundwater availability, draft and allocation for the State is summarised
in Table. 5.7. The details of the methodology are presented in Annex. 5.1.
Table. 5.7:   Ground water status of Tamil Nadu as on JanuarY 1998

Total dynamic ground water resource                 23070.4251 MCum
Net annual ground water availability                20763.3828 MCum
Gross draft for irrigation                          16581.0128 MCum
Gross draft for domestic and Industrial demand      645.5791 MCum
Allocation for domestic and industrial              878.9327 Mcum

Net ground water availability for future irrigation  3303.4471 fMCum
The block-wise groundwater potential and utilisable groundwater resources for the 28 districts of
Tamil Nadu were reassessed as per the recommendations of GWREC - '1997. This estimation as on
January 2003 has been made to facilitate and to formulate strategies for sustainable development of
ground water resources with latest yearly picture. The categorization of blocks as on January 2003
covering all the blocks of Tamil Nadu is given in Annex. 5.2. Summary data of the status of blocks
w.r.t. ground water exploitation in Tamil Nadu is presented in Table 5.8. C(ategorisatiQn of blocks has
been made mainly based on the stage of groundwater development and water level trend.
Accordingly, the blocks have been categorised as safe, semi-critical, critical and over exploited areas.
Table. 5.8:   Cateciorisation of blocks as on January 1998 and Januarv 2003

Total                          385                        385
Safe areas: Safe areas are the blocks where ground water resource assessment shows stage of ground water
development at 70% or less and there is no significant long term decline of pre or post monspon ground water
levels.
Areas where ground water resource assessment shows stage of ground water development more thian 70% but
less than 90% and both pre monsoon and post monsoon ground water levels do not show a sighificant long term
decline. However in these areas caution may be exercised in planning future development witlh regard to
quantum of additional ground water withdrawal.

5.2.3    Ground water level
The groundwater level is regularly monitored by the groundwater wing of PWD in 1746 observation
wells (open wells) and 852 piezometers located all over the State. The CGWB also monitors water
level from 700 wells spread over the entire State. CGWB observes water level once in 3 seasons
namely, May, August and November. The TWAD Board is also monitoring water level through a
network of 1290 wells. The TWAD Board is collecting water level data twice in a year i.e., during pre-
monsoon and post-monsoon seasons in the months of January and May.
The average annual rainfall for the period 1991-2002 is furnished Filg 5.11 for the purpose of
correlation with the groundwater level. It may be seen from the rainfall histogram that the annual
rainfall is less than the State normal rainfall since 1999.

The following inferences are drawn from Fig 5.1 1. There is a good correlation between the rainfall and
water level. Below normal rainfall is observed in the State for the last four years due to which there is
alarming lowering trend of water level in almost all the districts of the State.
Long-term water level fluctuation: The long-term water level fluctuation for the period 1971 to 2003
has been studied for the State. The study indicated over exploitation of groundwater for drinking and
irrigation purposes and a declining trend in groundwater level since 1971. But the problem has
become acute especially since 1999 due to consecutive monsoon failures. In Coimbatore, Madurai
and Theni districts, the declining trend in water level is conspicuous - 1-5m in Theni district and 5-1 Om
in Madurai and Coimbatore districts. While in all other districts, the decline in water level has been
marginal during the period from 1971 to 1998. In Cuddalore district, Portonova (Parar gi Pettai) block
falls in safe category, where the groundwater development is less than 70%. The trend in
groundwater level is almost flat. The fall in water level is 0.5-lm only. In Panruti block, which is
classified as semi-critical (GWD: 70-90%) there is a declining trend of water level nd the drop in
water level is about 6m. In Dindigul district, Nilakottai block, which falls in critical category (GWD: 90-

100%) and in the Vathalagundu block, which falls in over exploited category (GWD > 100%) drop in
water level is to the tune of 8m.
In Nagapattinam and Kanchipuram districts, the downward trend of water table is not alarming. In
Virudhunagar district, the fall in water level is about 6-8m. in Dharmapuri district, there is a drop in
water level to the tune of 1Om (during 2000-03). (Annex. 5.3). In the wells located in command areas,
the drop in water level is minimum, since, they are located in the discharge zones, where there is
recharging of groundwater due to return flow of irrigation or recharge from canals, d ms etc. District
wise well hydrographs in selected observation wells indicate that there is a fall in water level to the
tune of 2-8m during 2000 - 2003. Declining trend of water level is observed in almost all the districts
of Tamil Nadu (Annex. 5.4).
5.2.4   Time Series Analysis
An exercise in time series analysis was undertaken with reference to the stage of groundwater
development and water level data for the following sample blocks, taking into consideration the past
trends in these parameters.
1. Karur district - Thogaimalai block - Pillaikodangipatti village
2. Thiruvellore district - Thiruvellore Taluk - Pakkam village
The stage of groundwater development has been worked out for the State of Tamil Nadu based on
the GWREC - 1997 methodology (described in Annex. 5.1) by the PWID SG&SW data centre and
CGWB. Thogaimalai block of Karur district is categorised as a safe block (with groundwater
development: <70%) based on the data collected and analysed as on January 1998. Also projection
has been made to January 2003 for groundwater development (report on dynamic groundwater
resources of TN) by PWD & CGWB. Taking these as input data, projections have been made to
January 2004, January 2005 and January 2010 following the above methodology and assuming a
0.4% growth rate of GWD. The results are presented in Table 5.9 & Fig. 5.12.
Similarly, for the Thiruvellore block of Thiruvellore district, groundwater development has been
projected to January 2004, January 2005 and January 2010 (Table 5.9). It is evident from the above
table that assuming a growth rate development of 0.3% per year, this block may remain as semi-
critical (GWD: 70-90%) until 2010. This block is categorised as semi-critical as on January, 1998,
2003 and 2004 and is likely to remain as semi-critical during 2005 and 2010 also.
Water level trend analysis
Long term water level data were analysed and the trend plotted for the following areas based on the
observation well data.
1. Karaikalavakkam village - Thiruvellore block - Thiruvellore district.
2. Gangapuram village - Peranamallur block - Thiruvannamalai district.
The water level trends were plotted for the pre-monsoon (August) and post-mi nsoon periods
(January) from the existing data collected from PWD - SG&SWRDC taking into cc nsidleration the
above control wells projections were made upto 2010. The following assumptions havia been made in
making the projections for water level trends.
1. Normal rainfall will occur throughout the projection period.
2. Though the abstraction structures may increase every year, recharging of aquifers will be
generally enhanced due to the artificial recharge measures taken up in the reas.

Thiruvellore block of Thiruvellore district is a sedimentary area with numerous lakes and ponds
recharging the aquifers. Analysis of water level data of pre and post monsoon periods (well no.
13104U of PWD) indicates that the water level trend is not alarmingly lowering and that there is a fall
of about 0.5-1 m each year.
Analysis of post-monsoon data (January) in well no. 23016AY located at Gangapurarn village -
Peranamallur block of Thiruvellore district indicates that though decllining trend of water level
continues, drop in water level is to the tune of 1-2m (bgl) only. Whereas pre-monsoon water level
trend indicates that the drop in water level is to the tune of 4-5m (bgl). EIfficient water management
and artificial recharge measures, if implemented, may arrest the downward trend of water level.
5.2.5   Groundwater Quality
The TWAD Board, as the main agency entrusted with the taste of providirig public water supply in the
state has generated an extensive data base on the quality of rural water supplies. An exercise has
been undertaken by TWAD as late as 2002. The following is a summary review of the status of water
quality in rural areas of Tamil Nadu.
Total dissolved solids (TDS), fluoride (F), nitrate (NO3) and iron (Fe) are the major parameters
considered for potability of any water source. The number of habitations affected by single and
multiple parameters is indicated in Figs. 5.13 & 5.14.
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS): The study conducted by TWAD Board indicates that the water sources with
high TDS are evenly distributed all over Tamil Nadu. The districts of Coimbatore, Dindigul,
Kanchipuram,   Karur,  Madurai,   Nagapattinam,  Namakkal,   Perambalur,  Pudukkottai,
Ramanathapuram, Salem, Sivagangai, Thiruvannamalai, Tiruvarur, Thiruvellore, Tirunelveli, Tuticorin,
Vellore, Villupuram and Virudhunagar have recorded higher concentrations of TDS (>2000 mg/lit).
(Fig. 5.15).
Fluoride (F): Presence of fluoride concentrations greater than 1.5 mg/lit will affect the health and cause
dental fluorosis. High concentrations of fluoride above the permissible limit is recorded in the districts

5.2.6   Groundwater Contamination due to Industrial Pollution
In Tamil Nadu, pollution of water resources due to industrial wastes is primarily caused through the
discharge of industrial effluents, and municipal sewerage let into the iriver system. Sonie of the
contaminant sources which pose a major threat to the drinking water supply are: landfills, waste water
disposal, industrial effluent disposal and application of fertilizer and pesticidJes in the agricultural fields.
Some of the major industries, which contribute to pollution in the rivers, are, listed in Table 5.12.

5.2.7   Ground water recharge
Groundwater is recognized as a strategic resource for socio-economic development. In Tamil Nadu
indiscriminate extraction of groundwater and monsoon failures result in the constant depletion of
groundwater table and also deterioration in the ground water quality. This necessitates an urgent
need for taking up measures for replenishing the same to make the source sustainable.
The planning and implementation of groundwater recharge structures specific to the conditions of the
terrain is found to be producing tangible results. For this, systematic hydro-geological studies, water
quality studies, geo-morphological and geological studies are essentiall to decide on appropriate
design and structure. The TWAD has carried out a project through the Iristitute of Remote Sensing,
Anna University, Chennai and prepared Zonation maps for recharge and block-wise action plans for
recharging the groundwater aquifers in the State. The type of recharge structures recommended by
the above study are furnished in Table 5.13.
5.2.8   Need for groundwater recharge:
The need for constructing groundwater recharge structures as part of the proposed water supply and
sanitation project is evident from the following considerations.
i.    In the water stressed area declining water tables have necessitated deepening of existing
abstraction structures thereby increasing the cost of withdrawal, quality deterioration and
other environmental problems.
ii.    Since freshwater resources are limited in quantity the only alternative is to store every drop of
rainwater through appropriate water harvesting techniques for use at the time of stress.
iii.  In certain areas though the yield of bore wells is adequate they rnay contain dissolved salts
beyond the permissible limits. The recharge measures may help in diluting the dissolved salt
concentration and make it potable.
Recharge of groundwater takes place when the rainwater infiltrates into the underlying layers. The
rate of recharge depends upon the type of soil, intensity and duration of water-spread on the ground.
Hence, the rate of infiltration and the resulting recharge can be improved by retarding the speed or

The impact assessment of 990 recharge structures constructed by TWAD Board during 2001 - 2004
for sustainability of drinking water resources indicate an appreciable rise iin water level in the area of
influence of recharge structures. There is a general lowering of water level observed since the year
2000 due to below normal rainfall. Where as in the areas where drinking water sources are located,
raise in water level is observed due to recharge measures taken by TWAD Board. The observations
made by analysing the water level data collected by TWAD in selected districts are as given below.

Due to implementation of recharge structures, 2-8m rise in ground water level is observed in Theni
and Coimbatore district. In districts such as Dharmapuri, Erode, Thiruvarur, Virudhunagar and
Thiruvelveli, 2-4m rise is observed. 2-3m increase of water level is noticed in Thiruvellore,
Thiruvanamalai, Tricy, Thanjavur, Perambalur, Madurai districts. This in general indicate that rise in
water level is observed due to induced recharge near the recharge structures.
5.2.10  Water Quality Monitoring
To provide safe drinking water to the public, water quality monitoring is given high priority by the
TWAD. To meet this objective, one State level, 28 districts and one mobile laboratory have been
established with facilities to conduct physical, bacteriological and biological examinations for water,
sewage and pollution samples. Water samples are tested and certified for their potability.
To assess the quality status of ground water in Tamil Nadu, a water quality-monitoring network has
been established by various departments like TWAD Board and PWDSG & SW Resources data
centre. The TWAD Board is monitoring the water quality through a network of 1290 observation wells.
PWD is monitoring the GW quality through a network of 1222 control wells (dug wells) and 854
piezometers. Water samples from the network of wells are collected and analysed for their chemical
constituents during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The facilities available in TWAD
Board and PWD Groundwater Data Center are furnished below.
Laboratory facilities of TWAD
State level laboratory: The State level laboratory is functioning at Chennai. This was the first
laboratory to be established in 1964 and is technically controlling all other field laboratories. In
addition to the facilities to test routine water quality parameters, this laboratory has facilities to test
trace metals, and organic pollutants. This laboratory is the first public water-testing laboratory in India
to have obtained the ISO 9002 certification.
District Laboratories: The District Laboratories are located in each one of the 28 districts in the
State. Out of these, 25 labs were established with aid from Gol under the Rajiv Gandhi National
Drinking Water Mission.

Treatment Plant Laboratories: For major water works, separate laboratories have been established
for day to day water quality monitoring and control. The locations of these laboratories are as under:
1. Velliangadu (Coimbatore WSS - Improvement)
2. Siruvani (Coimbatore WSS)
3. Komburankadu (Salem & Athur WSS)
4. Pannapatty (Madurai WSS)
5. Surapet (Avadi defence WSS)
6. Hosur (Hosur-SIPCOT WSS)
Mobile Laboratory: One Mobile Laboratory received under Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water
Mission programme is now functioning at Coimbatore. This laboratory is used for field level testing
and conducting awareness programmes on water quality.
Laboratory Facilities of PWD SG & SW Resources Data Center: In Tamil Nadu, under the PWD,
State Ground and Surface Water Resources Data center, four laboratories are functioning one each
at Chennai, Trichy, Madurai and Pollachi. These laboratories have facilities for complete analysis of
physico-chemical and bacteriological parameters of water samples.
5.3     Socio-economic environment
5.3.1   Population
Tamil Nadu is the 6th most populous State in India with a total population of 62.11 million (2001
Census) comprising 31.26 million male and 30.84 million female population. It is also one of the most
urbanised States in India with 27.24 million people living in urban areas while the rest 34.87 million
constitute the rural population. The total rural population has increased from 24.7 million in 1961 to
36.61 million in 1991 and fallen to 31.87 million in 2001. This could possibly be due to the upgradation
of Rural Panchayats to Town Panchayats based on the population and other criteria. Data on district
wise rural population and number of males and females is presented in Talble. 5.14.
The population densities in various districts and the mix of urban and ruiral population are shown in
Fig 5.20. The rural population is high (above 20,00,000) with respect to toltal population in Villupuram,
Dharmapuri and Vellore districts. The male and female population is almost uniformly distributed in
many of the districts. However, the female population is high comparecl to the male population in
Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Ramanathapuram, Sivagangai and Thiruvellore districts. The concentratiorn
of rural population with respect to total population is found to be high in Villupuram, Dharmapuri, and
Vellore districts.
The decadal growth rate of the rural population in the State was 16.36% in 1961-71 and it has
decreased to 12.78% in 1981-91. During the period 1991-2000, the growth rate of rural population
was in negative of 4.75%. In the last decade, among the districts of Tamil Nadu, a maximum decadal
growth rate of population was 22.35% in Thiruvellore district followed by 20.40% in C,oimbatore
district. The minimum growth rate was 4.32% in Sivagangai district followed by 4.33% and 4.44% in
Theni and Kanyakumari districts respectively, probably due to out-migration to other districts of the
State.

From Fig. 5.21 it may be noted that partially covered habitations are high in Dharmapuri, Erode,
Salem, and Pudukkottai districts. More than 3000 habitations are partially covered. Not covered
habitations are high in Pudukkottai, Erode and Thiruvellore districts.
(i)     Habitations benefited
To improve the drinking water facilities in rural areas, TWAD has implemented various water supply
schemes both combined and individual schemes all over the State. The habitations benefited under
these schemes and expenditure incurred is given in Table 5.16.

There is a significant increase in number of benefited habitations and in turn the expenditure from
1997-98. The number of habitations covered under each year shows an increasing trend over the last
few years.
(ii)     Combined Water Supply Schemes
Combined water supply schemes play a significant role where problems due to quality, quantity or
both prevail in the local sources. In such schemes, wayside habitations are added to the urban water
supply schemes where the source is from infiltration wells or galleries. The details regardingl the
number of CWSS and beneficiaries are listed in Table 5.17.

5.3.4   Status of Rural Sanitation in Tamil Nadu
Access to Individual/ Household Toilets
As per the 2001 Census, only 14 percent (1187919) of the total households (8274790) in the State
have toilets within the house. Region-wise, northern and western regions account for a higher
percentage of households without toilet facility than the State figure. About 88 percent of total
households in the northern region do not have toilet facility.
As per the distribution of households by toilets among the districts of Tamil Nadu, more than 90
percentage of households do not have toilet facility in Villupuram and Thiruvannamalai districts
(northern region), and Perambalur and Ariyalur districts (eastern region), while 66.39 percent of
households in Kanyakumari district have toilet facility followed by 32.19 percent in Nilgiris district. Of

the 29 districts in Tamil Nadu, except two districts, viz., Kanyakumari and Nilgiris all the remaining
districts have very poor sanitation coverage.
(i)     Type of Toilets
In the households having toilets, 51.27 percent of total toilets were water closets, 31.75 percent were
pit latrines and the remaining 16.98 percent were other types of toilets. WJhen comparing the type of
toilets among the regions in Tamil Nadu, 61 percent of the total toilets in eastern region, followed by
51 percent in southern region were water closets. More than 30 percent of total toilets in northern,
western and southern regions were pit latrines.
During the last eight years, about 10.25 lakhs toilets were constructed in rural areas of Tamil Nadu,
which includes individual toilets, school toilets, toilets for anganwadis, women sanitary complexes and
rural sanitary marts. The maximum numbers of 447631 toilets were constructed in 1990 - 2000, which
was about 44 percent of the total toilets. (Fig. 5.22).

(ii)    Individual Toilets
It is observed from Fig. 5.23 that during the last eight years, the maximum number of 441922 toilets
were constructed for individual households in 1999 - 2000 (about 44 percent) because the total
sanitation campaign was started during that year, but has decreased since then.

Distribution of Households by Type and access to Drainage
The drainage facilities in rural areas of Tamil Nadu are very poor. As per Census 2001, about 73
percent of the total households in rural areas of Tamil Nadu do not have any type of drainage facility
for wastewater outlet from the house. Of the remaining 27 percent of the total households, which
have drainage facility, 23 percent have open drainage and only 4 percent have covered drainage.
Region / District wise access to Drainage
Among the regions in Tamil Nadu, the drainage arrangement in eastern region was the poorest.
About 82 percent of the total households do not have any type of drainage facility for wastewater
outlet from the house. Tow third of the total households in the northern region have no proper
drainage system. In western and southern regions, more than one fourth of the total households have
open drainage system whereas in the eastern region it is less than 15 percent. In all four regions and
overall Tamil Nadu, only 4 to 5 percent of the total households have closedl drainage system to let out
wastewater from their houses.
(iii)   Status of Total Sanitation Campaign projects
All the 28 districts of Tamil Nadu (other than Chennai district, which is categorised as urban district)
are implementing the Total Sanitation Campaign projects in the State. Under this program individual
toilets, school toilets, anganwadi toilets and women's sanitary complexes are being constructed. As
on 04-07-2003, 4.76 lakh individual toilets, 5898 school toilets, 298 women complexes and 3817
balwadi toilets have been constructed while 51 Rural Sanitary Marts (RSM) / PCs have been
established.
The total capital outlay for the 28 projects as above is Rs. 327.32 crores. Out of this, the Central
share, State share and the beneficiary contributions are Rs. 186.39 crores, Rs. 77.5 crores and  Rs.
63.42 crores respectively. The total expenditure incurred till 04-07-2003 is Rs. 65.51 crores. The
physical and financial progress under the TSC as on 04-07-2003 for the State are given in Annex.
5.6.

TSC Action plan for 2003-2004: Action plan proposed for TSC projects in Tamil Nadu for the year
2003-04 include construction of 7.40 lakh individual toilets, 769 women complexes, 12365 school
toilets, 12666 anganwadi toilets and establishment of 161 RSC / PCs. The district-wise details of
proposed action plan are given in Annex. 5.7.
5.3.5   Health Indicators
Acute diahorreal diseases and suspected Cholera are common among the water borne diseases in
Tamil Nadu. The year wise statistics of cases reported in rural areas for the incidence of Malaria,
Polio, VPD, and Diphtheria are furnished in Annex. 5.8.
The data shows a declining trend in cases affected by various diseases prevailing in the State
especially the water borne diseases in the last few years. The incidence of ADD cases has a direct
bearing on the quality of water and personal hygiene status of individuals handling water and food.
There has been high incidence of ADD cases in Kanchipuram, Vellore, T'hiruvannamalai, Theni and
Dindigul. However, the incidence of ADD cases as well as deaths do not follow any definite trend
during the past 5 years excepting that the cases are consistently occurring year after year. (Annex.
5.8).
The time series data (1999-2000) for the number of cases and deaths due to ADD / Cholera for the
State of Tamil Nadu is presented in Table 5.18.

Source: Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, GoTN
From the data it is seen that the ADD cases seem to remain consistent over the last 5 years.
However, there has been a decline in Cholera cases only in 2003, otherwise the rate of incidence has
been consistent.
Annex. 5.8 gives the data on a number of Malaria cases reported from the major towns in the State
including Chennai Corporation. From the data it is noted that there has been a general decline in the
incidence of malaria cases over the last 6 years. However, it may be of interest to note that more than
two-thirds of the cases are reported from Chennai Corporation area alone. The existence of many
polluted waterways in the city could possibly be contributing to the large nLlmber of cases reported.
5.3.6   Status of Human Development in Tamil Nadu
Tamil Nadu's HDI (2001) was 0.657 as compared to 0.571 for India. It is also well placed in the South
Asian context and fares better than some of the neighboring countries of India. According to the
Planning Commission, Tamil Nadu ranks third among the 15 major States of India, though on a few
specific indicators it lags behind some states. Within Tamil Nadu there are gaps and variations in the
inter-district HDI, but its level of achievement suggests that high standards of literacy and health can
be reached despite low per capita income. Even so, improvement of income levels would insuLre
improved literacy and health status. Annex. 5.9 provides a summary of the Status of Human
development in Tamil Nadu.

5.3.7   Summary review of baseline status
From a detailed review of available secondary data, the following points emerge which are of direct
significance in the context of the proposed TNRWSS project.
State Profile
Tamil Nadu, one of the 28 States in the Indian union is located at the Souith-eastern tip of Peninsular
India between North latitude 80 0' and 130 30' and East longitude 760 15' and 80° 18'. It is the 11th
largest State in India with a geographical area of130058 sq.km. Tamil Nadu has a forest cover of only
16.5% of the total area as against the recommended 33%. It is the 6th most populous State of India
with a total population of 62.11 million as per 2001 Census out of which 34.87 million (56.14%) live in
rural areas. With a male-female ratio of 1000:986, the State's total literacy rate is 73.47% (male:
82.33%, female: 64.55%), the second highest in the country.
This State is administratively divided into 29 districts (excluding Chennai), 206 taluks, 385 blocks
(unions) and 17274 revenue villages. There are over 80,000 habitations in the State.
Physiographically the State is divided into 4 regions namely, the Coastal Plains, Eastern Ghats, The
Central Plateau and the Western Ghats. The State, with a sub-tropical climate, receives a normal
rainfall of 964mm per annum mainly through the SW monsoon and NE monsoon seasons.
Geologically, 73.5% of the total area of the State comprises crystalline formations while the rest
constitutes sedimentary formations. The soils of the State are grouped into 3 categories namely Red
soils (61%), Black soil (12%) and Coastal / River Alluvium (24%).
Water Resources Scenario
With 17 major river basins, the per capita water resources of Tamil Nadu is 4224.5 m3, which is much
less than the national average of 24645 m3. Estimated total water resources potential of the State is
28361 MCu.m (Surface: 13015MCu.m + Ground: 15346MCu.m) with a total estimated dJemand of
31821 MCu.m in 2004, the State experiences a deficit of 3460MCu.m which is expected to increase to
6919MCu.m by the year 2050.
Having harnessed more than 95% of the available water resources in the State, the future scenario
from water resources point of view and its sustainability would appear lto be grim. Out of 16 river
basins, 5 basins namely Palar, Varahanadi, Paravanar, Vaippar and Kodaiayar are the only surplus
basins. The remaining 11 basins are rated as deficit basins. This situation is only likely to accentuate
due to the decreased availability of per capita water resources on the one hand and the continuous
degradation of the quality of water resources on the other hand due to the cumulative impact of
competing demands on the meagre resources and laxity in the enforcement of pollution control
measures. This situation is further compounded by the failure of monsoons consecutively over the last
3-4 years.
Rural water supply sources
Presently almost the entire rural water supply systems depend upon ground water sources as would
be evident from the statistics on the distribution of RWS sources (Table. 5.15). This dependence on
groundwater is bound to continue even in future as some of the existing perennial surface sources are
tending to become non-perennial.
It is well recognised that the major share of the available resources are exploited for irrigation (over
85%), while the requirement for drinking purposes constitutes only a minor fraction. Thus, any attempt

aimed at improving the irrigation efficiency from the present level of 40% to even 50% could have a
phenomenal impact in making available enormous quantities of water for purposes such as public
water supply which has the first charge on available water resources.
Status of groundwater development
As of now, out of the total 385 blocks in the State, 175 blocks have already come under the over
exploited (137) and critical (38) categories, thus, constituting nearly 45%0 of the total blocks in the
State. Some initiatives have been made by the government to contain the situation by making it
mandatory for the installation of rainwater harvesting structures in all existing and new buildings and
also giving a thrust to the implementation of water conservation structuires such as check dams,
nallah bunds, percolation ponds etc. in rural areas. It would also becomie imperative to take up as
integral part of the proposed project recharging of groundwater at or close to the source so as to
promote the sustainability of the source in all future RWS systems.
Presently there is practically no control on the abstraction of groundwater especially for irrigation
purposes except in the case of schemes proposed with funding from NABARD and other such
agencies. However, this does not have any restraint on the big farmers who are putting up a large
number of borewells without any financial assistance of lending agencies.
Declining trend in water level
Though the groundwater resources will remain the main stay for meeting the future water supply
needs, there are serious water quantity and quality problems in several districts, which will pose a
challenge in planning and design of future systems. As for quantity, there has been a continuous
declining trend in water levels in many of the districts due to over exploitation of groundwater
resources to meet the domestic, industrial and agricultural requirements.
A long term (1971-2003) study by the PWD has indicated that over exploitation of groundwater over
the years has caused a decline in trend in groundwater level throughout the State. But the problem
has become acute especially since 1999 due to consecutive monsoon failures. For instance, in
Coimbatore, Madurai and Theni districts, the fall in water level is conspicuous - 1-5m in Theni district,
5-10m in Madurai and Coimbatore districts. In the rest of the districts, al decline in water level has
been marginal during the period 1971-1998.
Illegal sand mining on a large scale in the past coupled with discharge of untreated / partially treated
municipal and industrial wastes have had their toll on the viability of many of these subsurface
abstraction structures such as infiltration wells and galleries located on the banks of rivers. However,
the recent government orders eliminating the contract system of sand rnining is bound to have a
positive impact over a period of time.

Total                                  81787
Water quality issues
The quality problems relate to primarily excessive concentration of dissolved solids, nitrate, fluoride
and in a few instances iron. (refer Table 5.10 & 5.11). In terms of the numiber of habitatons, there are
2868 habitations in the State as on 31-03-2003, which are affected by quality problems due to multiple
parameters (Fig. 5.13). Of these 1899 habitations are affected by fluoride alone (Fig. 5.18).
State wide data on the quality of hand pump supplies has revealed that out of 1,49,457 samples
tested 52,816 comprising 35.4% were not potable due to the presence of iexcessive concentrations of
TDS, fluoride, nitrate etc. (Table 5.10). Like wise, a significant proportion (93214 out of 36481 samples)
were found non-potable in respect of power pump sources (Table. 5.11).
In Tamil Nadu, pollution of water resources due to industrial wastes is primarily caused through the
discharge of industrial effluents, and municipal sewerage let into the river system. Some of the
contaminant sources which pose a major threat to the drinking water supply are: landfills, waste water
disposal, industrial effluent disposal and application of fertilizer and pesticidJes in the agricultural fields.
Some of the major industries which contribute to pollution in the rivers are Ilisted in Table 5.12.
Water treatment
Past experience in the State and elsewhere in the country is abound to show that treatment systems
provided in rural areas have not been successful due to a variety of reasons chief among them being
absence of proper operation and maintenance and lack of resources to command technical back up
support. In this background all-out efforts should be made to avoid, as far as possible, a groundwater
source that is likely to pose a quality problem. In such cases, recourse to clistant surface / sub-surface
sources may become inevitable with the consequent impact on the cost of such systems.
In existing piped RWS systems there is no scientific system of chlorinating the water supplies prior to
distribution as observed by the absence of any chlorinating systems in almost all cases. Sorne
bleaching powder is dropped into the overhead tanks at intervals which are not regular and wherever
it is done only once in 2 weeks or so. Such a practice defeats the very purpose of providing
bacteriologically safe drinking water to the consumers.
Water quality monitoring
A number of agencies such as TWAD, PWD Ground Water, TNPCB, King Institute etc. are currently
engaged in water quality monitoring. The objective of monitoring, the frequency of sample collection,
and the parameters of analysis vary from one institution to the other. Most of these institutions
function as independent entities without any coordination between them. Also there is no effective

mechanism by which the information generated is shared by the other agencies so as to be useful in
planning and managing the water resources. More importantly, the owners of the RWS systems have
no access to this information in order to even create awareness as to the quality of water that the
people are consuming in rural areas. The existing State Ground and Surlace Water Resources Data
Centre of PWD should be strengthened if necessary to function as the nodal agency for compiling all
available information on water quality and to bring out useful products such as bulletins and reports
for the benefit of the users even at the lowest village level.
Sanitation coverage
Despite the various sanitation programs implemented over the past decade, the coverage of rural
households with sanitary latrines has been very low (14%). This is partly due to the absence of
effective awareness programs for creating the demand and also due to the low priority accorded by
the government in its development plans.
Water and sanitation related issues
Despite considerable investments in water supply and sanitation sector in the past decade, the impact
on the health and hygiene of the rural population has not been commensurate as is evident from the
large number of reported cases of water and sanitation related diseases in the State (Annex. 5.8).
5.3.8  Issues arising from Public Consultations
From the public consultations organised in the sample districts, the following issues of environmental
concern have emerged. The outcomes of the consultation meetings are given in Annex. 1.4. (A few
selected photographs depicting the existing environmental scenario are given here).
Quantity issues
A major concern of the people in the sample villages where public consultations were heldl relates to
the present low level of water supply service. This situation gets worse during summer when the
demand increases. The main reasons are due to a decline in yield of the source(s) or drying up of the
sources due to rapid fall in water level. Instances are common where people are forced to buy water
from commercial vendors to meet their needs. Inequity in distribution of supply due to inherent
system constraints is also noticed in certain cases. In addition, there are instances where the newly
developed areas in the villages are yet to get the benefit of piped water supply.
Quality issues
The poor quality of water supplied is an equally serious concern of the people in the sample villages.
The high TDS and the associated taste are not acceptable to people. There are also complaints from
people regarding a gradual deterioration in the quality of ground water drawn from lbore-wells.
Instances of sub-surface water drawn from riverbeds having been polluted due to the discharge of
industrial effluents are also reported. In the absence of a better option, they have to be content with
the quality of the supply. Those who are economically well off, buy water of better quality from
vendors or bottled water for drinking. Though no data is readily available regarding the bacteriological
quality of water supplies, serious outbreaks of waterborne diseases have not been reported.
Falling ground water level
A common remark by the people in the sample villages is the fast declining ground water level
resulting in the drying up of the source or reduction of the yield. This is attributed to the failure of
monsoon rains in the last four years and the increasing demand for variouss uses.

Household sanitation issues
The sanitation coverage in general is very low and the age-old practice of open defection is widely
prevalent. People are willing to construct their individual household latrines for which they are ready
to contribute. In some cases, because of space constraints, people seem to prefer cluster toilets or
community toilets. Lack of awareness among people regarding the inter-relationship between water,
sanitation and health is common in all the villages.
Environmental sanitation issues
Lack of sanitary methods of sullage and solid waste disposal is felt in almost all sample villages.
Absence of good internal roads, proper approach roads to village burning ghats, inadequate street
lighting are some of the common complaints from the villagers. Stagnant pools of sullage leading to
mosquito nuisance is also reported.
5.3.9   Identification of Hotspots and Strategy for Mitigation
Based on a critical review and analysis of secondary data, the proceedings of the Public consultations
and the experience and field observations of the consultants, hotspots in the context of the proposed
TNRWSS project have been identified. The hotspots relate to the major ilssues of i) water quality, ii)
water quantity and iii) household and environmental sanitation.
i)     Water Quality: The hot spots with respect to water quality are defined as those districts
having in their water supply, concentration of fluoride, TDS, N03 and iron in excess of
permissible limits as per IS10500-1991. The corresponding pararneter values are F-1.5 mg/I,
TDS-2000 mg/I, N03-45 mg/l and Fe-1 mg /I.
ii)    Water Quantity: The hot spots with respect to water quantity relate to the blocks which have
come under the 'overexploited' and 'critical' categories in terms of grounld water
development.
iii)   Household and Environmental Sanitation: As for household sanitation (individual sanitary
latrines), in view of the present low coverage (14%), the entire state is reckoned as hot spots.
Likewise, due to the low coverage / lack of environmental sanitation facilities in rnost of the
villages, all the districts have been considered as hot spots for environmental sanitation.
Water Quality hotspots: In the State of Tamil Nadu, with over 80,000 habitations spread over 29
districts, the quality of rural water supply in the entire State has been assessed as late as 2003
by TWAD by collecting and analysing water samples from 1,49,457 hand pump sources and
36,418 power pump sources. Likewise the PWD has been monitoring the water quality from
1746 observation wells scattered throughout the State. There are a number of habitations
affected by one or more parameters of water quality having a bearing on the potability from
aesthetic or public health considerations.
Fluoride: The worst affected districts with respect to fluoride exceeding the permissible level of
1.5mg/l in the order of severity of the problem are given in Table 5.19.

Excepting the districts of Thiruvellore, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Perambalur,
Pudukkottai, Nilgiris, Madurai, Ramanathapuram, lirunelveli and Kanyakumari, all the remaining
districts can be considered as hot spots.
Total Dissolved Solids: As for TDS, the study by the TWAD Board indicates that sources with high
TDS are evenly distributed all over Tamil Nadu (Fig. 5.15). The study also noted that a high
percentage of non - potability of samples due to high TDS was recorded in Ramanathapuram district
where a large number of desalination plants have been installed for rural water supply.
Nitrate: Like TDS, nitrate also is found in high concentration (>50mg/I) in almost all the districts in the
state. The highest concentration has been recorded in Salem district. Thie nitrate level is high (>100
mg/I) also in Dharmapuri district. The other districts with high nitrate in drinking water are Vellore,
Erode, Coimbatore, Perambalur, Karur, Pudukottai & Ariyalur.
Iron: Iron in drinking water is not a serious problem except in isolated areas. The highest iron value
recorded in the state was 86.7 mg/l in Tiruvallur district.
Multiple Parameters: The most affected districts by water quality problem with multiple parameters is
Dharmapuri followed by Ramanathapuram, Vellore, Salem, Kanchipuram, Virudhunagar, Namakkal,
Sivagangai and Thiruvannamalai.
The status as discussed above clearly brings out the wide-spread probilem of water quality in the
state. This information would provide a valuable indication of the nature of water quality problem that
may be anticipated in a district while planning the TNRWSS project. This will also facilitate a decision
whether a ground water source is likely to be more appropriate or a surface source.
Hotspots for Water Quantity: The scenario with respect to ground water development in the 385
blocks in the state is summarised in Tables 5.20 & 5.21 and Fig. 5.24. From the data for the entire
state, the following Table has been prepared based on the number of over-exploited and critical
blocks for only those districts which have a large number of blocks under these two categories taken
together.

Villupuram                22        13        4
This data again would go a long way in the planning and implementation of the proposed TNRWSS
project. Depending on the level of ground water development, alternative strategies could be
considered with reference to the source including ground water recharge measures and, regulatory
control on ground water development for irrigation, indlustrial and other uses.

However, these figures, although indicative of the over all water balance, should be taken with a great
deal of caution particularly as regards domestic water supply where spot specific availability is more
critical than average area figures, and where water quality is as critical as sheer availability.

a) Water Quality
*  Identification of alternate local sources (ground water / surface sources such as village
tanks, local streams, etc) or economically viable distant sources for single / multi-village
scheme(s).
*  Providing appropriate household / community treatment systems for identified water
quality problem (should be the last option)
*  Continuous chlorination of water supply to maintain a minimum residual concentration of
0.2 mg / I at the farthest public stand post
*  Adoption of dual water supply that provides safe potable water for drinking and cooking
purposes only.
*  Preventive and corrective maintenance of water distribution systems
*  Regular water quality monitoring and control
*  Sustained IEC campaigns
b) Water Quantity
*  Augment supply through rehabilitation / upgrading of existing systems wherever feasible
*  Augment supply from new sources - ground water or surface source in the vicinity of the
VP or distant source.
*  Ground water recharge at the source to promote source sustainability
*  Enforce Tamil Nadu Ground Water Act to regulate and control ground water abstraction
for irrigation / industrial use
*  Regular monitoring of ground water level
0
c) Ground Water Recharge
The technology choice will be specific to the hydrogeological conditions of the area and will be
implemented with active participation of the beneficiary communities in planning, implementation and
management. The project envisages capacity building for the NGO, ancl members of the VPs and
HWSCs on comprehensive development of recharge / catchment of the source point for ensuring
sustainable recharge. In this context, the groundwater recharge zonation rnaps prepared by the Anna
University with recourse to remote sensing tools could provide a sound basis for detailed planning.
d) Household Sanitation
*  Effective, sustained IEC programme with focus on women to generate demand for
household latrines, cluster toilets
*  Installation of safe sanitation systems appropriate to local soil type
e) Environmental Sanitation
*  Effective, sustained IEC campaigns to generate demand for ownership based cluster
toilets / community latrines and provision of institutional latrines and their proper use aind
maintenance
*  Provision of sullage / storm water drainage including its treatment and disposal
*  Promote soak pits and kitchen gardens wherever feasible
*  Pavement of village lanes/ roads with appropriate materials

9 Sanitation & Hygiene Promotion
Health and hygiene education is very important in the process of changing the human attitude and
behaviour. It aims to change social factors that influence life styles of people with different behavioural
patterns. In order to implement the SHP programme, the following strategy is recommended;
*  Integration of SHP components in the water supply and sanitation services.
*  Hygiene promotion with focus on core behaviours of haind washing, proper water
collection, storage and handling practices
*  Creation, usage and extension of participatory methods and tools for hygiene promotion
*  Capacity building at multi-level through training programmes and interacting workshops
*  Developing and disseminating IEC package through mass education, group and
interpersonal approach
*  Village level participatory gender equated action plan by the communities
*  Involvement of village based self-help groups of women, anganwadi workers and health
personnel in promotional activities
*  A systematic and participatory process of monitoring of SHP initiatives and activities
Establishment of unified multi-disciplinary teams for single org anisational support window
to the communities.

6       Environmental Risks and Impacts
6.1     Introduction
In the context of the proposed TNRWSS project and the activities for the project components, this
chapter identifies and analyses the potential environmental impacts and risks. For each of the project
interventions, the impacts have been classified as positive / negative and primary / secondary. This
exercise will form the basis for designing the mitigatory measures to be integrated in the overall
project design so as to eliminate / minimise / compensate for the likely negative impacts and to
enhance the net positive impact due to the project.
The implementation of the proposed TNRWSS project may be consideredJ to comprise three phases:
(i) the planning / preparatory phase (ii) the construction phase and (iii) the post construction or the
operational phase. The component activities under these phases will be as follows.
6.1.1   Planning / Preparatory Phase
*  Information, Education and Communication (IEC) campaigrns in the project districts to
create awareness among the target communities regarding lthe proposed project and to
generate demand for the project.
*  Public Consultations with the beneficiary communities regarding their needs, priorities
and preferences  with respect to the project components and to identify issues of
environmental concern.
*  Identification of technology options for source, water treatment, distribution and ground
water recharge, safe disposal of sullage, proper use and maintenance of sanitation
facilities and promotion of personal hygiene.
*  Site identification / selection for source location, treatment works, service reservoirs and

*  Regular Sanitation Hygiene Promotion (SHP) programmes to promote proper use and
upkeep of the facilities installed, and safe personal hygiene practices
*  Institutional capacity building through periodic orientation programmes for VP / TP level
functionaries in their identified areas of activity
The project will bring about positive health and environmental benefits through supply of 'safe'
drinking water and creation of sanitary facilities in the village.
The potential environmental risks and impacts arising from the project interventions / activities have
been identified and the impacts classified as positive / negative and presented in a matrix form in
Table 6.1. Appropriate environmental mitigation measures should be included in the project design
to have a net positive effect on the environment.
6.1.4   Pre-Construction Phase Impacts
During the pre-construction phase, intensive IEC campaigns will be launched in the project districts.
These will be aimed at creating awareness among the target communities regarding the local
environmental issues, the objective and scope of the proposed water supply and sanitation project
and the rules for participation in the project by the community. These campaigns are expected to
generate demand for the project from the target communities.
The IEC campaigns will be followed by detailed public consultations with the communities in project
planning and formulation. The technology options for the various project components along with the
order of costs thereof will be discussed with the target communities to enable them decide on the
project profile in keeping with the rules for participation.
To bring about an increase in the per capita supply to a level demanded by the beneficiary
community, new sources (ground / surface water) have to be identified. For more than 90% of the
new water supply schemes, the source will be ground water tapped through dug / bore wells. The
associated risks to bore well sources which can have an impact on the cost of the project should be
recognised. These relate to failure of the bore, low yield or poor quality of water requiring treatment to
make it potable. If the new sources are to be located in private lands, these have to be acquired
through voluntary donation or by paying appropriate cash compensation.
Likewise, the ground water recharge component of the project, aimed at achieving sustainability of
water supply source, envisages construction of appropriate structures nearby the sites identified for
source location. These sites may come under privately owned or government land. The need for
land acquisition and cash compensation, if any, will be known only after thie site identification is made
and the type and number of structures decided. The issue of land acquisition and compensation is
being addressed under a separate social assessment study. This issue, however, is not expected to
be of any major concern and could be resolved easily by the beneficiary ccimmunity and the VP.
6.2     Construction phase impacts
During the construction phase, the major activities will comprise earthvvork excavation, trenching,
transportation of construction materials, handling, laying and jointing of pipes, and building of
structures such as pumping stations, treatment works, ground level reservoirs / overhead tanks etc.
These activities would cause a general increase in the suspended partiiculate matter (dust) in the
ambient air. The increase in concentration, however, would be of a tempiorary nature andl localised.
Likewise, the increment in noise levels due to the proposed activities will also be negligible.

The rehabilitation of existing water supply schemes may involve repair / replacement of some
components of the system. This may result in temporary disruption in existing water supply services.
During construction of sullage drains, there will be disruption of normal movement of people. Such
disruptions, however, will be minimal and of a short duration.
The project activities are not likely to involve loss or disturbance of sensitive areas aind cultural
properties. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population in the project area will also have
the benefit of participation in the proposed project. However the project data sheet of Individual and
Combined water supply schemes require this evaluation to be under taken at project lpreparation
stage. The project will generate significant employment opportunities during the construction stage in
addition to some indirect employment. This in turn will have a positive impact on the income level of
the population, both local and regional.
6.3     Operations phase impacts
6.3.1   Positive impacts
Access to Adequate Quantity of Safe Water on a Sustainable Basis: The most significant positive
impact of the project in the operation phase will be the availability of adequate quantity of safe
drinking water on a sustainable basis thus meeting a basic need for a healthy, productive life of
people in the villages. The water supply schemes will be designed for an average of 40 lpcd with a
provision for 55 Ipcd wherever feasible.
Reduction in Drudgery in Water Collection and Generation of Income Opporturities: The
proposed water supply schemes will ensure a better service delivery which would enable supply of
safe water at convenient public points and through house connections on demand. This will largely
eliminate / reduce the drudgery in fetching the daily water needs by the households, particularly
women and children. The time and labour saved due to the better and more conveniept service could
provide opportunities for income generation, especially for women. Due to improved access to piped
water supply at convenient locations, the need for individual household expenditure on buying water
could be significantly reduced, if not eliminated. However, part of this beniefit will be off set by the fact
that the individual households have to pay their share towards the cost of O&M of the public facility.
Source Sustainability through Ground Water Recharge: The construction of ground water
recharge structures of appropriate design to suit the local soil conditions and hydrogieology will
promote the sustainability of water supply sources. These measures, would also help reduce surface
run off, minimise soil erosion, promote growth of vegetation and arrest / reverse the declining trend in
ground water level observed in certain areas in the project districts. In areas affected by excessive
concentration of chemical contaminants such as fluoride, TDS etc. grounid water recharge will bring
about an improvement in water quality through dilution.
Improved Personal and Environmental Hygiene: Availability of adequate supply of safe water
through the new schemes would promote better personal and environmental hy9iene which is
presently at a low level, especially among the poor sections of the comrnunity. This impact will be
further enhanced through a regular and continuing programme of sanitation and hyg,iene promotion
activities targeted on the beneficiary population to bring about positive behavioural and attitudinal
changes.
The household sanitation systems (sanitary latrines and sullage disposal), under the proposed project
would help rninimise soil and surface water contamination. These measures will bring about a

significant reduction in the incidence of water and sanitation related diseases which are widely
prevalent in the project districts and improvement in the general aesthetics of the village. Due to
improved health, medical expenses of the households are expected to decrease.
Employment Opportunities: The proposed project involves operation and maintenance of large
number of water supply schemes and ground water recharge structures. This will generate significant
employment opportunities to the local technicians and NGOs which in turn will have a positive impact
on the income levels of the wage earners and small entrepreneurs.
Community Capacity Building and Self Reliance: The bottom-up planning and decision making
which are essential ingredients of the proposed project and routine operation and maintenance of the
assets created would generate and promote among the beneficiary communities a sense of pride and
self reliance, and enhance their capacity building in other sectors of community development.
6.3.2   Potential negative impacts and Risks
Increased Ground / Surface Water Abstraction: Most of the proposedl water supply schemes will
be based on ground water sources tapped through dug / bore wells fitted with power pumps. The
schemes also provide for individual house connections on demand at the owner's cost. Improved
water supply service levels would result in increased abstraction of ground / surface water in the area.
However, the additional draft would constitute only a small percentage (less than 10%) of that used
for irrigation. Considering the fact that the stage of ground water development in many of the project
districts is critical, the increased abstraction would cause significant impact on the ground water
regime. However, the ground water recharge component which will form ain integral part of the project
for achieving sustainability of the source would largely compensate for the increased abstraction of
ground water. The Tamil Nadu Ground Water Act when passed and enforced would also go a long
way in mitigating the problem of over exploitation.
Lowering of Ground Water Level: As per available long term (1990-2000) data, there has been a
declining trend in ground water level in many districts (Annex 5.3) indicating that mining of water is
taking place. Creation of additional / new sources in such critical areas may increase the gravity of
the situation. This could be mitigated by ensuring proper siting of the new source(s), imlplementing
concurrently compensatory ground water recharge measures and, regulating the ground water
abstraction for other than public water supply by enforcing the Tamil Nadu Ground Water Act.
Risk of Hydraulic Interference between Existing and New Bore Well Sources: When a high
yielding source is located for a new scheme in an area with a number of already existing irrigation
bore wells, there is a potential risk of hydraulic interference between the bore well sources. In
extreme cases, the nearby sources may dry up. This problem could be minimised / eliminated by
observing the criteria of minimum distance for locating a new source from an existing one and by
regulating ground water abstraction including closure of existing irrigation wells in an over-exploited
area after the enabling legal provisions are in place under the Ground Water Act.
Risk of Ground Water Contamination: An important component of the proposed project relates to
the construction of large number of household safe sanitation systems / ownership based group
latrines / community latrines and institutional latrines in the project villages. The type of soil and its
depth in the project districts vary considerably so also their infiltration capacity. Depending on the
nature of soil in an area, the sanitation systems may pose a risk of ground water contamination unless
safe sanitation technologies best suited to the local soil type and hydrogeology are selected and
installed and adequate preventive and corrective measures are implemented. T The preventive
measures woulcd include proper siting of new sources and sanitary protection of a I water supply

sources. The single most important corrective measure is to ensure continuous, effective chlorination
of all water supplies.
6.4      Conclusion
In sum, the overall impact of the project on the beneficiary communities and the environment is
expected to be positive resulting in an improvement in the health and quality of life of the people in the
project area. Adverse impacts, if any, could be minimised I compensated by incorporating appropriate
mitigation measures which could be readily designed and integrated with the project as discussed in
the following chapter.

7       Environmental Management Framework
7.1     Introduction
The proposed TNRWSS project, as discussed earlier, will bring iabout positive health and
environmental benefits through supply of safe drinking water, provision of safe sanitation systems,
sustained health and hygiene education programmes as also ground water recharge measures aimed
at sustainability of community water supply sources.  The project may cause some adverse
environmental impacts depending upon the site specific situations encountered in the project area.
Appropriate environmental mitigation measures have been identified and discussed in this chapter.
These measures suitably integrated in the project design would mitigate / minimise the adverse
impacts and enhance the net positive benefit of the project.
This chapter also presents a framework which can facilitate the integration of environmental concerns
as appropriate right at the time of the project formulation by the support organisatiQn I agency on
behalf of the beneficiary community / Village Panchayat Like wise, another performa has been
developed which would enable the appraisal agency (DWSA - DPMU) a decision regarding funding of
the project and also ensure compliance with appropriate environmental safe guard$ by the project
proponent.
As stated earlier in section 1.4, the initial scope of the study included environmental analysis of both
rural water supply and sanitation activities, to be financed under the project. However, it is understood
now that the project is not likely to finance sanitation component. But the report includes
environmental issues, impact and mitigatory measures as well which couild be used by GoTN while
implanting the sanitation component and can be used as resource material for developing IEC
programme.
7.2     Key environmental issues and mitigation measures
An analysis of the base line data, observations during site visits, discussions with State / district and
VP level functionaries and the outcome of public consultations have clearly brought out the following
key environmental issues that need to be addressed in the project design and implementation.
7.2.1   Water quantity issues
Most habitations in the State have access to organized water supply. The level of per capita supply,
however, varies widely between the habitations (Ref Table 5.15). The rninimum per capita supply
prescribed by the State is 40 lpcd. There are 6091 habitations in the project districts with a per capita
supply less than 40 Ipcd. Many of these habitations experience acute scarcity of 'safe' drinking water
in summer and therefore need augmentation of supply.
During periods of scarcity and in areas with severe water quality problems, villagers have to use
traditional water sources of suspect water quality.
Existing water supply schemes, especially in the salinity-affected areas of Nagapattinam and
Tiruvarur district, are mostly utilized to meet water needs for other than drinking purposes such as
washing and bathing.

According to the information available on long term ground water level, there is a declining trend in
water level in almost all the districts. This phenomenon is attributed to overexploitation of ground
water for agricultural and industrial uses. As per data from the PWD, there are 138 number blocks in
the State which have been categorised as 'over-exploited', 37 blocks under category 'critical', 105
blocks under category 'semi-critical' while the rest of the blocks come under the 'safe' category (Ref.
Table 5.8). But as far as the State as whole is concerned, there is still scope for further ground water
utilisation.
(i)     Mitigation measures
Augmentation of existing water supplies will be achieved through one or miore of the following options.
a) Augment through rehabilitation / upgrading of existing systems wherever feasible
b) Identification of new sources (local / distant) of good quality and yield *t safety chlorination. These
will be mostly ground water sources. In areas not affected by chemical contaminants, new good-
yielding ground water sources could be identified using modern geophysical techniques (to
minimize failure rate) or existing privately owned irrigation wells of good yield and potable quality
could be identified and acquired.
c) Identification of local surface sources (village ponds / streams/ canals) which require only simple
treatment (SSF / river bed filtration) and chlorination. Existing village tanks, if considered as an
alternate source, need to be desilted / enlarged to increase their storage capacity and protected
by fencing to prevent contamination from human / animal access. For villages located in the
vicinity of seasonal rivers / streams the feasibility of tapping sub-surface flow (riverbed filtration)
could be explored.
d) Distant surface sources with simple treatment (SSF) and chlorination ifor a group of villages (multi
village schemes)
e) Dual water supply - existing supplies (rejected by community due to quality problem) for purposes
other than drinking and potable water supply through any of the options listed above.
f) Appropriate blending of water from existing sources (ground water) to obtain the drinking water
quality standards.
g) Effective enforcement of Tamil Nadu Ground Water Act to regulate and control ground water
abstraction to accord priority for drinking water. Identified critical areas with falling water level
should be notified forthwith by the Appropriate Authority and the Act enforced in all its
earnestness to halt this trend.
h) Concurrent ground water recharge at the source to promote source sustainability. This activity
should receive priority in order to achieve sustainability of water supply sources. The PWD may
conduct a detailed survey to identify potential sites and appropriate conservation structures such
as check dams, sub-surface dykes, recharge trenches, percolation ponds, abandoned bore wells
etc. best suited to the local conditions.
i) Regular monitoring of ground water level: The PWD / TWAD Board would regularly rnonitor the
ground water as an integral part of overall monitoring program.
The key consideration in deciding on the alternative should be to eliminatie, as far as practicable, the
need for any treatment. A trade off analysis of the feasible options should be clearly presented to the
beneficiary community to enable them to decide on their choice.
7.2.2   Water quality issues
The water quality problem in the State is essentially of three types (i) the natural presence in ground
water of chemical contaminants such as fluoride, TDS, iron and nitrate of geological origin in
concentrations exceeding the levels permissible in drinking water and (ii) the chemical /
bacteriological contamination of water at the source, due to municipal and industrial discharges and

(iii) after contamination in the distribution systems due to intermittent water supplies or during
collection, handling, storage and use at the consumers end. The concerns for ground and surface
water contamination relate to:
i)  Non point sources of pollution in the catchment area due to the common practice of open air
defecation, and possible agricultural and surface run off, especially dJuring the rainy season;
ii) Washing, bathirig and other domestic activities around the open dug wells / bore wells with hand
pumps, IMIWS schemes by the communities;
iii) Indiscriminate dumping of household solid waste near water points;
iv) Improper siting of public water points at low lying areas due to non-availability of appropriate
Government sites;
v) Uncovered cisterns / absence of regular / periodical cleaning of OHTs / cisterns;
vi) Inadequate and irregular disinfection of drinking water supplies;
vii) Inadequate testing and irregular monitoring of drinking water quality;
viii) Unhygienic practice of collecting water by the households from pits dug in the ground due to
inadequate residual pressure in the distribution pipe;
ix) Frequent breakage / leakage in rising main and distribution lines;
x) Frequent leakage at valve chambers;
xi) Misuse of valve chambers as defecation places by the community;
xii) Improper collection, storage and handling of water by the households;
The bacteriological contamination of water supply is confirmed by the persistent incidence of water
borne / water related diseases in all the districts (Ref Tables 5.18).
(i)     Mitigation measures
i.   Sanitary survey of all existing and new sources of water supply to identify potential sources of
contamination.  The recommended procedure for sanitary survey is described in a
Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOPs);
ii.  Source protection - the measures will include conversion of existing dug / bore wells into
sanitary wells and fencing of surface sources to prevent human / animal access and catchment
area protection. A technical note on sanitary protection of dug wells is given in a ECOPs;
iii.  Effective and continuous chlorination of existing and new water supplies to obtain a minimum
residual chlorine of 0.5 mg/l. Details of a simple, effective system of chlorination of pumped
water supplies using bleaching powder solution are included in ECOPs;
iv.  Preventive and corrective maintenance of water distribution system (leak detection / repair and
control) and preparedness for crisis management during major breakdowns;
v.   Regular water quality testing and control;
vi.  Proper location of cisterns and measures to prevent misuse of valve chambers as defecation
places;
vii.  Ensuring adequate residual pressure at the distribution points;
viii.  Promotion of household / cluster toilets and community latrine complexes / institutional latrines;

i.   ADD, Cholera and typhoid cases are still being reported in the state. There is also the problem
of high fluoride in drinking water in many districts. A large number of cases of worm infestation
have also been reported.
ii.  The personal hygiene standard of the people in general, especially of the economically
disadvantaged, is very poor.
iii.  Health and hygiene education programmes are not effective.
iv.  ILack of awareness and non-affordability to meet the medical expenses by some of the people
who suffer from water-borne & water related diseases aggravate the situation which leads to
outbreak of epidemics.
(i)     Mitigation measures
i.   Effective, sustained Sanitation and hygienic programmes with special focus on women and
children to create a felt need for household latrines and also to adopt desirable personal / family
and community hygiene practices.
ii.  Preventive and curative measures including regular de-worming programmes.
iii.  An organized survey by well trained medical doctors and para / non medical staff to idenlify
fluorosis cases especially among school children, pregnant womebn and lactating mothers to
carry out programme of curative medication including nutritional supplements in addition to
supply of safe defluoridated water.
7.3     Implernentation and supervision arrangements
In the light of the proposed project interventions, the identified environmental issues and the potential
adverse impacts during the project implementation, the recommended environmental management
framework (EMF) along with the agencies responsible are presented in Talble 7.1. This coulld form the
basis for action plans for implementation. The overall Project Implementation Plan (PIP) incorporates
the implementation arrangements (described below) as well as integrates with other project
requirements such as technical, financial, procurement and institutional arrangements.
7.3.1   Individual schemes
Based on an assessment by the consultants during site visits to sample districts, public consultations
and discussions with TWAD officials it is expected that the stand alone schemes and individual village
schemes under the proposed TNRWSS Project are not likely to pose any serious environmental
concerns to be addressed. Nonetheless, it is necessary to ensure that relevant environmental issues,
if any, are identified up front at the time of project planning and formulation.
With a view to facilitating this process, a simple check list has been designed as given in Table 7.2a
for Individual schemes. The duly filled in checklist should form an essential part, as a supplement of

the project proposal to be submitted by the client. The broad contents of lthe project proposal is listed
in Annex 7.1. This will enable the review agency (DWSA - DPMU) to vet the proposal from
environmental perspective for further processing of the proposal and funding..
7.3.2   Combinecd schemes
Under the proposed TNRWSS project, it is envisaged that a significant number of CWS schemes are
likely to be implemented to meet the needs of cluster of communities / villages / habitations. In view of
the sheer size of the population to be covered and the area spread of the project components, it is
likely that some of these projects may encounter issues of environmental concern to be aiddressed in
the formulation of the project.
With a view to facilitating this process, a simple check list has been desicned as given in Table 7.2b
for Multi-village schemes. The duly filled in checklist should form an essential part, as a supplement of
the project proposal to be submitted by the client. This will enable the review agency (DWSA -
DPMU) to vet the proposal from environmental perspective for further processing of the proposal and
funding for combined water supply schemes.
7.3.3  Institutional set up
In order to facilitate such a process, a set of frameworks have been designed: for the use of the
project proponent and the appraisal agency (DWSA - DPMU) as shown in Table 7.3. C,ompliance
with Table 7.3 will ensure that the project has been formulated integrating the environmental
perspectives in the project.
The above discussion implies that the institutional framework proposed for the implementation of the
project is adequately staffed with competent personnel with experience in environmental engineering.
The proposed institutional framework for the TNRWSS Project envisages, as part of the Operations
Wing, a Manager (Operation, M&E) for evaluation and monitoring of the schemes. It may be
necessary to strengthen this wing in order to take on the role of project appraisal also from
environmental perspective.

7.3.4   Appraisal and evaluation procedure
New rural water supply project proposals submitted by a proponent (SO! TWAD) would be appraised
from environmental considerations by the technical wing of the proposed organizational 'setup. The
project proposal should be accompanied by the environmental data sheet supported with a detailed
note, if any on items listed in the data sheet. In order to ensure effective and meaningful appraisal, the
technical wing should, among others be manned by a qualified competent team of Water supply
Engineer, Hydro-geologist, etc with experience in environmental engineering. The appraiser who will
be the Manager (M&E), on review of the environmental data sheet can seek additiohal information/
clarification as required prior to approval of the project for further processing. He may if necessary
undertake a site visit to the project area prior to the approval of the proposal.
In summary the following procedure will be followed for evaluation/appraiisal of various water supply
schemes:
*  Submission of scheme proposal application along with filled up environmental data sheet by
project proponent to technical wings
*  Evaluation/appraisal of the proposal for potential environmental risks based on available
information with the following possible decision:
o    Optionl - Accept the proposal without further query certifying the adequacy of
environmental information and insignificant environmental risks
o    Option 2 - Conditional acceptance of proposal with a request to provide additional
environmental information on specific aspects identified from the environment data
sheet
o    Option 3 - Site visit to verify the information from the data sheet and request for
additional environmental survey/information or assessment
The following table (Table 7-3) elaborates the procedures at various stages of project preparation
cycle.

7.3.5   Environmental Monitoring and Supervision arrangement during implementation
The implementation of water supply schemes are likely to result into varying level of environmental
impacts, that would require supervision and monitoring. The table below outlines a s:t of monitoring
indicators, which should be integrated into supervision plan for monitoring the ifectiveness of
implementation particularly, the Environmental mitigation measures.
The environmental monitoring and supervision will be undertaken to ensure compliance with the
recommended environmental mitigation measures. The supervision of implementation will be the
responsibility of the Manager (monitoring and evaluation) from the District Programme Management
Unit (DPMU). This task will be undertaken by an experienced environmental engineer. There would
also be periodic monitoring and supervision by the funding agency to ensure compliance with the
respective safe guard policy.
The following Table 7.4 summarises the monitoring and supervision plan.

Annex 1.1
Terms of Reference
Proposed Tamil Nadu Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) Project:
SECTOR ENVIRONMENT AL ANALYSIS
Background
1.    The Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN) is seeking World Bank assistance in
implementing its 5 year medium term RWSS program in Tamil Nadu. GoTN has
prioritized RWSS as a key area of its development agenda in its Tenth Plan (FY 2002-
07). GoTN intends to scale up the demand responsive approach statewide for the RWSS
sector, and has maintained a high level of investment in the sector indicating its high
priority. Government of India too supports the RWSS sector reforms and provides
significant financial assistance to Tamil Nadu through its centrally sponsored programs
such as ARWSP, Swajaldhara and Total Sanitation Campaign.
2. In GoTN's Tenth Five Year Plan clear goals have been identified for 'water security',
including drinking water, health and ecological security. It also emphasizes demand
responsive approaches for both rural water and sanitation. Within these approaches, the
target for water is identified as "full coverage of all the rural habitations in the State with a
minimum of 40 Ipcd supply and 55 lpcd wherever possible" as well as "full ancl
independent coverage of habitations where socially marginalized groups live". For
sanitation facilities, the target is in terms of "coverage of the rural population with
individual or cluster toilets" with a target to reach 50 percent coverage by the end of tlhe
plan period. The Plan emphasis, however, is on measures to ensure sustainability of
RWSS systems rather than simply allocations and investments to build new facilities. It
argues for "a paradigm shift in the approach to the WSS sector" and for the output to be
"measured in terms of health spin off, environmental benefits, empowerment of women
and marginalized sections of the society and human resource development". For this,
institutional reforms are proposed with particular emphasis on decentralizing RWSS
service delivery responsibility to the rural local governments and village water and
sanitation committees and changing the role of government / government agencies from
provider to facilitate.
3.    GOTN has tentatively identified three main components for inclusion in the
Medium Term RWSS Program. These are:
(a) Community Development and RWSS Infrastructure Building: i) Community and
Village Panchayat capacity building, ii) Women's development programs, iii)
Construction / upgradation of drinking water supply, drainage and sanitation
schemes, including water quality monitoring programs, and iv) Targeted SC/ST-
development plan. Groundwater recharge and rainwater Iharvesting will be integral
parts of drinking water source development.
(b) Institution Building: (i) sector management and monitoring and evaluation (M&
E) systems, (ii) IEC campaigns, (iii) capacity building of program staff and support
agencies; and (iv) technical assistance for reorganization of TWAD (TamilNadu
Water and Drainage Board - the main line agency).
(c) Future Sector Planning: (i) developing long term policies and strategic plans, ii)
strengthening sector information management systems, iii) learning and piloting
innovative approaches
4.    RWSS is expected to bring about positive health and environmental benefits by
Annex- 1.1                                                          Page 1

TNRWSSP - SWAp                                                  TWAD Board
supplying 'safe' drinking water from sustainable sources, and creating sanitary conditions
in villages. However, if the projects are not designed / implemented properly, they could
result in some adverse impacts and for this reason environmental management plans are
prepared and implemented.
5.    Indicative list of key environmental concerns that the project will need to address
include:
LI Water Quantity Issues: declining groundwater tables and drying up of drinking
water sources especially in summer months), mainly due to high abstraction from
groundwater sources and unmatched recharging of aquifer; overexploitation of
groundwater resources severely impacting drinking water supply sources.
LI Water Quality Issues: fluorides, brackishness, nitrates in drinking water sources;
point and non-point sources of pollution of drinking water sources, including
contamination from agricultural and surface runoffs; industrial effluents, etc.;
inadequate monitoring of drinking water quality; inadequate and irregular
disinfection / chlorination of drinking water supplies; and washing / bathing and
other domestic activities around the sources of water supply and water points.
LI Household and Environmental Sanitation Issues: personal hygiene, health,
household environment and sanitation issues; extremiely low coverage of the
state household latrine program; improper and incdiscriminate disposal of
household solid waste, garbage etc; internal village roads without proper
formations or pavements; inadequate / non-functional sullage and storm water
drains.
6.     As a part of the project preparation, GoTN proposes to carry out a detailed
environmental analysis of the project and prepare an appropriate environmental
management plan and intends to recruit a consultant to assist GoTN in carrying out this
task.
Objectives of the Study
7.    The key objectives of the Environmental Analysis (EA) Study are:
* to identify and assess the existing environmental issues (with a focus on water
quantity and quality related issues; household and environmental sanitation
issues); and
* to prepare an Environment Management plan (EMP), including well-defined
performance indicators for addressing the identified issues, through the various
activities / tasks under the proposed project.
An Outline of the Tasks to be Carried Out
8.    The study will cover the entire State and will rely primarily on secondary sources
of information from various Government Departments, Agencies, Institutions, etc.
However, an upfront field survey in select, representative areas will be carried out for
getting information on the nature and severity of the environmental issues prevalent in
rural areas of the State.
9.    Public Consultations: Views of the target groups and the local NGOs will be taken
into account for the preparation of the EA. The public consultations shall be conducted in
Village Panchayats selected by GoTN, that are representative across the RWSS sector,
especially in terms of terrain, sources of water (ground water and surface) and the quallity
of water. These public consultations will help in identifying the existing issues and the
Annex- 1.1                                                          Page 2

proposed measures for addressing these issues. The public consultations as a minimum,
should meet the World Bank requirements on public consultations. Public Disclosure: On
finalizing the EA Report, the Summary EA along with the EMP will be disclosed at select
representative locations, identified by GoTN. The consultants will provide the necessary
assistance to GoTN in meeting the disclosure requirements, which at the minimum shall
meet the World Bank's policy on public disclosure.
10.   The specific tasks of the study are to:
a) Assess the availability of safe drinking water fromr surface / groundwater
sources, based on secondary sources of data and information. Specific data
should be collected regarding declining groundwater tables in the State ancl
hotspots need to be clearly identified for overexploited, critical, and semi-critical
areas.
b) Examine the extent and possible causes of contamination of drinking water
sources. The Consultant should collect information from relevant secondary
sources to examine possible point and non-point sources of contamination. The
water quality hotspots need to be clearly identified for eac:h district.
c) Assess adequacy of current water quality monitoring programs and institutional
capacity in the State, and provide recommendations for enhancing these as well
as disseminating water quality information to the rural public.
d) Assess current programs for disinfecting / treatment of drinking water-supplies
and provide recommendations for enhancing as well as rmaking these effective.
e) Assess household sanitation issues, including personal hygiene, health,
household environment and sanitation issues. Collect information on major
diseases and their causes, and assess how these can be! reduced through various
project interventions. Assess need for personal health anid hygiene programs.
f) Assess environmental sanitation issues pertaining to lthe rural areas, including
need for pavement of internal village roads and properly designed network of
sullage and storm water drains.
g) Review rural drinking water and sanitation sector related policies, legislations
and institutions and recommend appropriate policies and institutions for
addressing the environmental issues and attaining sustainable water ancl
sanitation services. [The SWAp provides an opportunity to review State / sector
related policies and institutions.]
h) Present an analysis of alternate scenarios to clearly bring out the value addition
of integrating environmental issues in the design of the project. The alternate
scenarios may specifically include centrally sponsored, sector reform and other
donor assisted RWSS programs / projects already implernented in Tamil Nadu.
i) Prepare an Environment Management Plan for recommending feasible and
cost-effective measures to address identified issues andil enhancing the quality of
the project. This will include measures to address:
i. source sustainability and strengthening (water quantity issues);
ii. fluorides, nitrates, brackishness, bacteriological contamination etc.
(water quality issues);
iii. hygiene and household sanitation issues;
iv. safe disposal of sullage and solid waste (environmental sanitation
issues).
Annex- 1.1                                                            Page 3

The EMP will also describe the implementation arrangements for the
environmental aspects, including capacity building and staffing requirements.
These measures will be integrated as part of the various project components and
sub-components.
j) Prepare guidelines for addressing the identified environmental issues. These
guidelines will be included in the Detailed Technical Manuals that will be prepared
by GoTN for project implementation. Examples of guidelines to be prepared are
given below.
i. Guidelines on Source Sustainability, Drinking Water Supply and
Distribution systems, including measures to increase recharge to
the aquifers; harness surface water and run-off; strengthen / protect
point sources such as bore-wells / dug wells; and other safeguard
measures for stand posts, hand pumps and distribution networks.
ii. Guidelines on Water Quality Managernent, including various
options: alternative safe ground / surface water, recharge, dilution,
or treatment.
iii. Guidelines on Safe Sanitation Technology Options, including safe
sanitation designs for simple pits, twin pits, septic tanks, etc.
iv. Guidelines on Safe Sullage Disposal, including design of drains
and safe disposal into soak pits, leach pits, kitchen gardens etc.
v. Guidelines on Safe Solid Waste IManagement, including
composting; vermiculture etc.
These guidelines need to be prepared, based on local soil characteristics, hydrogeology,
proximity of water sources, etc. The sanitation guidelines prepared by UNICEF, DANIDA,
Rural Development Department, etc. will be particularly useful in developing the
guidelines for safe sanitation technology options.
k) Develop environmental performance indicators, along with the methodology
and institutional  arrangements for monitoring the key environmental issues. These
indicators need to be duly  interfaced with the overall project indicators.
11. The assessment should be applicable to the entire State. The environmental issues
should be presented in detail, using Charts, Tables and Maps for clarity. Use of pie-charts
will be especially useful for analyzing the hotspots. The EMP and performance indicators
should be presented in a matrix format. The consultants will provide all relevant data /
information in this regard. All assumptions made should be clearly stated along with their
justification.
12. The EA Report should provide the information as well as the required analysis, and as
a minimum requirement, should be in accordance with the World Bank's OP / BP 4.01 on
Environmental Assessment and the Environmental Sourcebook Update on Water
Resources and Sanitation
13. Following is a check list of Bank Policies:
(i) Environmental Assessment: Operational Policy 4.0 1; Bank Procedures 4.0 1;
(ii) Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook.
14. The study covering the above tasks will be carried out in five stages:
Stage 1: Preparation of study tools, approach and methodology, identification of data
requirements, mode of
data collection and outline of the final report. Field Surveys in select, representative areas
for getting information on the nature and severity of the environmental issues prevalent in

Annex 1.4
Proceedings of Public Consultations
This annex presents the details of the public consultations organised at the selected Village
Panchayats from the 10 sample districts of Tamil Nadu.
1.1   PALAIASEEVARAM PANCHAYAT (Kanchipuram District)
Palaiaseevaram Village Panchayat which is located on the banks of Palar river comprises 6
habitations. Out of 6 habitations, 5 habitations are provided with water supply from infiltration
wells constructed in river Palar. The remaining habitation is providecl with water supply with a
borewell as source. In particular, 4 wells have been constructed near to the proposed
infiltration well for providing water supply to Sriperumbuthur and Poonamallee town
panchayats. Compared to the past, the present flow in the river is reduced considerably. This
apart, tappings for more number of towns and villages have been taken from the same
source. Pollution from tanneries, which are located upstream side, has no impact on the
above villages as such.
1.1.1 Present Water Supply Status
The present source of water supply for Sankarapuram village is from an infiltration well
constructed in the river Palar, which is located at a distance of 4 km from the village. The
infiltration well has a diameter of 4.5m and a depth of 5.5m. The wells sunk by Panchayat are
closer to the existing well. Hence, well interference may reduce the discharge.
In addition, the villagers are served with water supply from an open well, which is connected
to the Automatic Pressure (A.P) tank. Mainly, open well gets its recharge from the adjoining
tank. It is reported that even during summer months when the tanlk is dry, the villagers are
able to draw water from the open well. During the inspection it was found that the
maintenance of the open well as well as the A.P tank is foundl to be not satisfactory.
Particularly, the open well is not properly covered, and a lot of rubbish is thrown into the well.
Further, no chlorination arrangement is provided. The above system is maintained by the
local electrician. However, the main scheme is maintained by the Village Panchayat. For
maintaining the above system, 2 electricians are employed and an expenditure of about Rs.
700 per month is incurred towards their salary apart from electricity charges.
It is commonly felt by the villagers that during the summer months, sufficient quantity of water
is not made available. Further, they also feel considering the poor rainfall position in the
above area for the past 3-4 years, they are of the opinion that in the coming years the water
problem in summer months will be acute. It was also noticed that practically there is no
agricultural activity in and around this area due to poor rainfall. However, there is a general
reluctance among the people with regard to sharing of the capital cost of new scherne as well
as towards maintenance charges.
Annex - 1.4                                                           Page 1



Sector Environmental Analysis and Management Framework         Dalal Molt MacDonald
TNRWSSP - SWAp                                                       TWAD Board
Sankarapuram village located 2km off the main road between Chengalpet and
Kaanchipuram, forms a part of the 6 habitations of Palaiaseevaram Panchayat. The
population in this village as per the 2001 Census is 1394 amongst which 80 persons belong
to the Scheduled Caste. At present, water supply to the main village and habitations are from
borewells with hand pumps (out of the 4 hand pumps only 3 are functioning). School water
supply is given two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. During summer
months, it is anticipated that there will be acute water shortage due to decline in water level.
In the open well, water level is at 8.Om below the ground level. There is hardly lm of water
column, which may further drop during summer.
Presently a supply of 40-45 lpcd is being provided to the residents. The residents claim that
the supply falls short of 25 lpcd during the lean months in the summer. The main supply of
water comes from the Headworks constructed by the TWAD Board in the Palar river. Water is
pumped to an overhead tank of 1 lakh litre capacity. Apart from this the Palaiaseevaram
Panchayat has constructed 4 borewells of which only 3 are currently operational viz.
Palaiaseevaram (old colony and new colony), Sankarapuram. Grouindwater extraction is not
heavy in Palaiaseevaram area. Rural water supply is limited to 6 hours of pumping and
hence there is not much of hardship during summer.
Several streets have been provided with public fountains / taps. One tribal community had
been provided with a tap, but has recently shifted away to locate closer to the rock quarrying
site at Palaiaseevaram hill. A monthly charge of Rs. 30 is being collected to pay for the
electricity charges and a salary of Rs. 350 for each of the 2 electricians who operate the
pumps. The main occupation in this village is agriculture (groundnut cultivation). But in the
recent years, this has been discarded due to lack of water for irrigation.
1.1.2 Health and EnvironmentAspects
The Panchayat regularly cleans the overhead tank once a month. In addition, bleaching
powder is also used to disinfect the water. However, the residents complain of the odour of
Chlorine in their water. Cases of water borne diseases are reported, mainly due to the
stagnation of water near the public fountains / taps. A few houses have toilets built with
septic tanks, others resort to open defecation. The household sullage / wastewater is
disposed in their backyards.
As far as this village is concerned there is a serious environmental problem on account of the
location of Mohan Breweries and Distilleries Ltd. Due to constant emission of fine black
particles from the above factory, the villagers are complaining of blackening of walls and
floors due to the deposits in the houses. It is also mentioned that the persons who are
passing the site suffer from eye irritation. This is a matter of conceirn not only for this village
but also for the surrounding villages. Residents collectively complain of choking and
respiratory problems due to particulate matter being dispersed in aiir from the exhaust of the
sugar factory located in the vicinity. People complain of mosquito nuisance in the area
especially after the commissioning of the sugar factory.

1.1.3 Participation in newschemes
The residents are not well aware of the participatory programs offered by the Govt. and are
reluctant to take part in the schemes that require a token payment on their behalf. Even
during periods of utter scarcity, when the panchayat is not able to provide adequate quantity
of water, the residents are ready to bear silently rather than pay for services. However, they
expect Government schemes to be provided for them - the Government bearing the whole
cost.
1.2   RETTAKURICHI PANCHAYAT (Cuddalore District)
Rettakurichi Panchayat, located 1km off the main road between Vriddachalam and Salem,
about 3km west of Veppur village, consists of Rettakurichi village, an old colony and a new
colony. The habitations are provided with water supply from a Iborewell and open well.
Predominant portion of the population belongs to the Scheduled Caste community. The 2001
Census shows a population of 929. Owing to side bores constructed in the fields near the
open well, water level in the supply well is decreasing. The general quality of water is
satisfactory to the residents.
1.2.1 Present water supply status
The present supply of water is around 40 lpcd, which is likely to go down to 20 Ipcd during
summer season. The main source of water is a borewell (90m deptlh), which pumps water to
an overhead tank of 60,000 litre capacity. The pumping duration of 8 hours (intermittently)
does not help to fill the overhead tank. The water level in the well is reported to be at 25ft
(bgl).
Another source of water is the open well near the old colony. The well is of 6m diarneter and
14.3m deep, with water level at 13.Om below ground level. This well was originally planned
for the colony, but currently serves both the village and the colony. Apart from this there are
13 hand pumps, of which 9 are working satisfactorily. The water quality is reported to be
satisfactory to the villagers and they have no complaints of the watier being salty / sour. The
residents claim that the water level in the open well decreases due to the irrigation with side
bores. At present, the old colony has 3 borewells, of which 2 are not working.
1.2.2 Sanitation
Sullage is let in the backyards and to trees. Though the traditional practice of open
defecation is noticed, individual toilets have been constructed in 70 houses under the
DANIDA program, under which the residents are required to pay Rs. 1000 and the
Government provides another Rs. 2000. In another scheme, Totall Sanitation Campaign, a
lumpsum grant of Rs. 500 is given for construction of toilets.

1.2.3 Health and Environment Aspects
The panchayat arranges for washing of the overhead tank, oncie a month. There is no
reported cases of water related diseases in the village. Storm water drains have been
constructed for a distance of 160m and more coverage is expected to be undertaken shortly.
Toilets have been constructed in 70 houses under schemes such as Total Sanitation
Campaign and DANIDA, where the residents pay a part of the cost. The residents are
satisfied with the toilets constructed and are willing to pay for construction of more toilets for
their village. Wastewater / sullage from houses is disposed in the backyards or to trees.
Stagnation of water is not noticed and also no report of breeding of mosquitoes. Rain Water
Harvesting structures have been constructed in many of the houses. The local school is
provided with a Sintex tank and hand pump. Currently there is a problem in the pipe of the
tank and is not operational.
1.2.4 Willingness to participate in the proposed TNRWSSP
The residents are well informed of the various people's participatory programs and are eager
to pay for facilities offered under new schemes. There are 5 women's organizations in the
panchayat. Though women show an interest to take pait in the developmental activities, they
have no training. The residents interact well with the TWAD Board officials and are eager to
accept any water supply projects offered to them.
1.3   KOPPUR PANCHAYAT (Tiruvallur District)
Koppur panchayat is located at 12 km from Thiruvallur. It consists of habitations: Koppur
village, MGR Nagar and Koppur Colony. Population of Koppur village, Koppur colony and
MGR Nagar is 400, 400 and 191 respectively. The main source of water is from tube wells.
Water is drawn by power pumps as well as hand pumps. The general quality of water is
good. However, in certain areas, there is an excess of Total Dissolved Solids and Iron in the
water.
1.3.1 Present water supply status
Regarding the drinking water supply, in Koppur village, there are 2 tube wells with a depth of
140 ft each, in MGR Nagar, 1 tube well (220 ft depth), in Koppur colony 2 tube wells (160 ft
and 90 ft). Out of 2, one tube well, which was with hand pump, is now fitted with a power
pump, fills a tank of capacity 30,000 litre. In the Koppur village, there are 8 borewells with
hand pumps, groundwater level is declining since 1998. The water is supplied for 2 hours per
day alternately in each street. The local school has been provided with a 1000-litre Sintex
tank and water is pumped to it using a mini power pump. The present supply of water is 50
lpcd and is expected to go down to 40 lpcd in summer.
A decade back fish culture was carried out, which is now given upi due to lack of water for
sustaining it. There are 11 small ooranis and a big Eri (about 1200 acres). Deepening I

desilting of the Eri will improve irrigation potential and general recharging of aquifers. To
make the drinking water supply sustainable, de-silting of some of the tanks can be
contemplated. Sippaneri and Kudipithangal tanks, if improved, water supply in borewell can
be made sustainable.
1.3.2 Sanitation
The traditional practice of open defecation is predominant in this area. However, recently 84
toilets have been constructed with soak pits. 31 of these toilets are fitted with Sintex tanks.
There are no sewage water connections in the village.
1.3.3 Health and Environment Aspects
The panchayat undertakes the cleaning of the overhead tank regularly. Bleaching powder is
also added once in a fortnight. Household wastewater is disposed in the backyards. There is
no conspicuous drainage problem. The effluent from Balaji Distilleries Ltd located in
Aranvoyal, discharged into the river Kosathalaiar area, may contaminate the groundwater.
1.3.4 Participation in new schemes
The residents in general are not willing to pay for the proposed for schemes that require a
10% cash contribution. There are 6 Self-help groups with at least 15 members per group. Out
of this, one group is well organized and functioning efficiently.
1.4   Melachamangalam Panchayat (Vellore District)

as well as hand pumps. Some of the sources are saline in Mel Achamangalam habitation,
while in Peria Veetu Vattam, Vellakannam Vattam habitations Fluoride and Nitrate problem is
noticed. In Thakka Vattam the water is Nitrated affected and in Pillaiar Vattam, the water has
a high degree of total hardness. The hand pump source at Ponnilamman Koil Vattam has
gone dry. The main occupation in the Village Panchayat is Agriculture and Beedi making.
1.4.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells fitted power pumps. Each habitation has been
provided with a water supply source and is in use, excepting Ponniamman Koil Vattam where

the borewell has dried up. The daily supply of water during normal periods is 50 Ipcd, while it
goes down to 10 lpcd during summer. An OHT of 1 lakh litre capaicity is used to store and
distribute water to the habitations close to Mel Achamangalam.
Disinfecting is done once in every fortnight and washing of the tank is done every month.
Several of the habitations have quality problems (Fluoride, Nitrate and TDS) in the source. A
large number of villagers complain of inadequate water supply and insist on installation of
new borewells, pipeline extensions and mini tanks.
1.4.2 Sanitation
There are only 10 individual household latrines constructed in the entire Panchayat where
there are atleast 550 households and traditional practice of open dlefecation is predominant
in this area. There is a need for more community and individual latrines. The existing
community toilets are not put to use mainly due to inadequate water for washing purposes.
The villagers feel that provision of latrines with water facilities would improve the existing
condition.
1.4.3 Health and Environmental Aspects
Due to large number of people resorting to open defecation, there Ihave been several cases
of hook worm infestation. Household wastewater is disposed in the backyards. Some of the
streets have been constructed with storm water drains. If more drains are constructed,
stagnation of water during rainy season can be entirely eliminated.
1.4.4 Participation in new schemes
As regards participation in the TNRWSS Project, the residents were initially reluctant to
participate in new schemes that involved financial contribution; but after the consultation
process, when their doubts were cleared, the villagers showed their eagerness to contribute.
There are 6 Self-help groups with at least 15 members per group. Out of this, one group is
well organized and functioning efficiently.
1.5   KONDAPPANAYANA PALLI (Krishnagiri District)

1.5.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells fitted with hand pumps and power pumps. Each
habitation has been provided with 2 or more water supply sources and are in use. The daily
supply of water during normal periods is 40 lpcd, while it goes down to 10 Ipcd during
summer. An OHT of 60,000 litre capacity is used to store ancl distribute water to the
habitations close to Kodappanayana palli. It is felt that sinking borewells in the eri banks after
conducting detailed geophysical surveys may yield good results.
Chlorination using bleaching power is done once in every fortnight and washing of the tank is
done every month. A large number of villagers complain of inadequate water supply and
insist on installation of new borewells and mini power pumps. School water supply is
proposed to be commenced soon.
1.5.2 Sanitation
There are a few household latrines constructed in the entire Panchayat and traditional
practice of open defecation is predominant in this area. There is one public latrine and one
women's community toilet. The public latrine is not under use due to lack of water for
washing purposes. There is a need for more community and individual latrines with adequate
water facilities. The villagers feel that provision of latrines with water facilities would improve
the existing condition.

The main source of water is from bore wells and tube wells. Water is drawn by power pumps
as well as hand pumps. Water is pumped to OHTs in 3 places and is supplied through public
fountains.
Fluoride and Nitrate problem in drinking water is noticed. In Thakka Vattam, water is affected
by excess Nitrate and in Pillaiar Vattam, the water has a high degree of Total hardness. The
hand pump source at Ponniamman Koil Vattam has gone dry.
The main occupation in the Village Panchayat is agriculture and to some extent cattle
rearing.
1.6.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells fitted with power pumps. lEach habitation has been
provided with a water supply source and is in use. The daily supply of water during normal
periods is 55 Ipcd, while it goes down to 20 lpcd during summer. Thle capacity of the OHTs is
1 lakh litres each. Pumping of water to tanks is done intermittently as supply of electricity is
available only for 9 hours a day owing to load shedding. As some of the sources are saline,
water pumped from different sources is mixed and supplied. Further, some of the sources are
said to have high Iron content (boiled rice turns yellow in colour).
Chlorination is done once in a month only. The TWAD board collects water samiples frorr
time to time for water quality tests. However, the local public is not alware of the results of the
analysis. In general diahorrea seems to be the only malady. The villagers feel that the water
supplied is adequate only for drinking purposes. They find it difficull to manage the same for
washing, sanitation etc. It is reported that in certain deep borewells, installed under water
supply schemes, the reason for failure is that certain persons who have irrigation pumps
nearby had felt that there could be an interference with their source and have plugged the
pipes by filling it with stones.
1.6.2 Sanitation
There are public latrines in 4 places only. Recently, a community toilet has been built
exclusively for women folk and is being put to use. However, open defecation seems to be
the predominant practice. The reason for this being non-availability of water near the latrines
for washing purposes.
1.6.3 Health and Environment Aspects
There are no Village Water and Sanitation Committees to manage the water supply and its
treatment in a systematic manner. There is one Primary Health Centre in Manjini, which is
functioning well. Cases of diahorrea are the only recurring illness. There are storm water
drains constructed in some of the streets. More drains are proposed to be built in the near
future and there is problem of stagnation of rainwater.

1.6.4 Participation in new schemes
As for participation in the proposed project is concerned, the villagers are willing to pay for
the facilities offered. There are 14 Self-help groups with at least 15 members per group. Out
of this, one group is well organized and functioning efficiently. This group has set up a
departmental store and procures and sells goods at the same rates as available outside the
village. The remaining groups are not engaged in any significant activity. These groups do
not have adequate information on the types of activities that can be taken up.
1.7   PULATHERI (Karur District)
Pulatheri Panchayat is located at 20 km from Trichy. It consists of 5 habitations namely:
lyyagoundampatty, Pulatheri, Seethapatti, Siruvattupannaikalan and Velayipannaikupam.
The overall population as per 2001 census is 1027.
The main source of water is from bore wells and tube wells. Water is drawn by power pumps
as well as hand pumps. Water is pumped to 3 OHTs, each of capacity 10000 litres and is
supplied through public fountains and few house connections. The villagers complain of
inadequate supply and also that the water from the hand pumps being saline in
Velayipannaikuppam and Seethapatti habitations. The borewell in lyyagoundampatty has
failed recently. All borewells have been installed at a depth of 300ft or more.
The main occupation in the Village Panchayat is agriculture, which has been diminishing over
the years owing to scanty rainfall.
1.7.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells fitted with power pumps. lEach habitation has been
provided with a water supply source and is in use. The daily supply of water during normal
periods is 45 lpcd, while it goes down to 10 lpcd during summer. The capacity of the OHT is
10000 litres. There is no significant water quality problems in the Panchayat. Chlorination is
done once in a month and the water tank is cleaned only at every Gram Sabha meeting.
Water is supplied mainly through public fountains. Some 9 families have house connections.
For the house connections, a charge of Rs. 1000 is collected as deposit and Rs. 30 per
month for the supplying water. The remaining villagers who use the public fountains, no
charge is collected. Hence, the Panchayat is facing difficulty in paying the electricity charges
to TNEB. There have been several instances of the pipelines of house connections being
tapped illegally by some of the villagers. A considerable sum from the Panchayat's revenue
is spent on the electricity charges alone apart from paying the salary for the operators. The
operators have a basic level of education and have not been trained specially to undertake
the operation and maintenance of the pumpsets. Hence, they are capable of attending to
minor defects in the pumps only and will have to bring skilled persons from outside to fix
major repairs. There are several Eris, which can be taken up for de-silting / deepening so that
water stored in them could serve for a longer period.

1.7.2 Sanitation
There are no storm water drains in the entire Panchayat. This does; not pose any significant
problems as there are only short spells of rain. Rainwater harvesting structures have been
constructed in almost all the households. There are about 150 individual toilets in the entire
Panchayat. These have been constructed under the aid from an NGO named CARE.
However, as the latrines do not have proper cover, the villagers are not using them for lack of
privacy. Recently a community toilet complex was built. The keys for each unit have been
distributed among different families that are participating in the scheme. Open defecation is
also common. The reason for this being ease of choosing locations and non-availability of
water near the latrines for washing purposes.
1.7.3 Health and Environment Aspects
There are no Village Water and Sanitation Committees to manage the water supply and its
treatment in a systematic manner. There is one Primary Health Centre at Kavalkaran Patti,
3km away from Pulatheri. There are no major recurring illness reported in this Panchayat.
1 .7.4 Participation in new schemes
The participation level is comparatively high in this Panchayat. Through IEC programmes,
their willingness to contribute to the project will improve to great extent. To initiate
contribution towards facilities, it would be easier to involve the self-help groups and use them
as a model for the remaining people. There are 6 Self-help groups with at least 12 mnembers
per group. Out of these, three groups are well organized and functioning efficiently. However,
these groups do not have adequate information on the types of activities that can be taken
up.
1.8 THIRUNAGARI (Nagapattinam District)

Melatheru, Periyamedu, Poonchathan Theru colony, Thirunagari and Vedarajapuram. The
overall population as per 2001 census is 3895.
The main source of water is from bore wells. Water is drawn by power pumps as well as
hand pumps. Water is pumped to 3 OHTs, each of capacity 30000 litres and is supplied
through public fountains and few house connections.
The main occupation in the Village Panchayat is used to be agriculture. Now a days, the
villagers are engaged as agricultural labourers in other nearby villagles.

1.8.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells with hand pumps and power pumps. The villagers
complain of inadequate supply and also that the water from the hand pumps being saline in
Athankarai habitation. In general all the habitations have saline of ground water owing to
large number of Prawn culture farms, which use sea water in substantial quantities. These
farms were previously paddy fields and were converted due to fall in agriculture. The bottom
of these farms have not been sealed to prevent seepage into the ground. Apart from this
there is some amount of concentration of Iron in Thirunagari and Athankarai habitations.
Further in Kovilpannai area of Thirunagari, the pipes of the borewell have been corroded and
therefore it has failed.
The daily supply of water during normal periods is 50 lpcd, while it goes down to 10 Ipcd
during summer. The capacity of each of the OHT is 30000 litres. Chlorination is done once in
20days. Water is supplied mainly through public fountains. Some 12 families have house
connections. A charge of Rs. 1000 is collected as deposit and Rs. 30 per month for the water
supplied. For the remaining villagers who use the public fountains, water is supplied free of
cost. This puts a burden on the Panchayat in paying for the electricity charges to TNEB.
A large amount of the Panchayat's revenue is spent on the electricity charges and also for
paying the salary for the operators. The operators have a basic level of education and have
been trained specially to undertake the operation and maintenance of the pumpsets. Hence,
they are capable of attending to minor defects in the pumps like changing the fuse and
checking minor leaks. The Panchayat brings skilled persons from ouitside to fix major repairs.
1.8.2 Sanitation
There are no storm water drains constructed in the entire Panchayat. The only habitation that
is affected during rainy season is Athankarai, which is very close to the backwaters. There
are problems due to salt water being close to the habitation. The plasters in the walls of
houses have peeled off due to the saline water. A majority of the population resort to open
defecation. There are only a few individual toilets in the entire Panchayat. These have been
constructed by the villagers themselves with no external aid. There are latrines constructed in
schools. But only the teachers have access to this facility. One toilet is being constructed
exclusively for girls. Also there is one community toilet, which is put to use regularly. Both
men and women have access to this facility as there are 14 seats divided equally among
both the sexes., The beneficiaries do not pay any fee for using the community toilet. However,
some self help groups contribute a portion of the EB charges to the Panchayat.
1.8.3 Health and Environment Aspects
There are no Village Water and Sanitation Committees to manage the water supply in a
systematic manner. However, a group of local youths undertake the cleaning of the overhead
tanks regularly. There is one Primary Health Centre at Thiruvenkadu, 8km away from

Pulatheri. There are recurring health problems like Jaundice, fever, rashes and scratches
noticed in this Panchayat.
1.8.4 Participation in new schemes
There are as many as 60 Self-help groups in the Panchayat. Out of these, three groups are
well organized and functioning efficiently. In general, these groups do not have adequate
information on the types of activities that can be taken up. The main activity of each group
seems to be funding loans amongst themselves. Almost all the villagers have an aversion to
make financial contribution to schemes. They are even ready to walk for several kilometres to
get water free of cost. To initiate contribution towards facilities, it would be better to educate
the self-help groups in this context and use them in turn to spread the information gained to
the villagers.
1.9   T. KARISALKULAM (Virudhunagar District)
T. Karisalkulam (a.k.a Kamsapuram) Panchayat is located 40 kim from Virudhunagar. It

through public fountains and few house connections.
The main occupation in the Village Panchayat is agriculture and as wage workers in
agricultural fields.
1.9.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells with hand pumps and power pumps.. Water is
pumped to the overhead tanks and subsequently supplied to the villagers through public
fountains and house connections. The villagers complain of inadequate supply and also that
the water from the hand pumps being saline in T. Mettur habitation. The habitations of
T.Karisalkulam, T.Karisalkulam-H and L. Mettur have high calcium content.
The daily supply of water during normal periods is 40 Ipcd, while it goes down to 15 Ipcd
during summer. The capacity of each of the OHT is 30000 litres. Chlorination is done once in
20days. Water is supplied mainly through public fountains. Some 16 families have house
connections. A charge of Rs. 1000 is collected as deposit and Rs. 30 per month for the water
supplied. For the remaining villagers who use the public fountains, Ithe water is supplied free
of cost. This puts a burden on the Panchayat in paying the electricity charges to TNEB.
A large amount of the Panchayat's revenue is spent on the electricity charges and also for
paying the salary for the operators and maintenance work. The operators have a basic level
of education and have not been trained specially to undertake the operation and

maintenance of the pumpsets. Hence, they are capable of attending to minor defects only.
The Panchayat brings skilled persons from outside to fix major repairs.
1.9.2 Sanitation
Only T. Karisalkulam habitation has 100 toilets constructed, while the people in remaining
habitations resort to open defecation. These have been constructed by the villagers
themselves with no external aid. There are latrines constructed in schools. But only the
teachers have access to this facility. Storm water drains have not been constructed in any
part of the Panchayat. Breeding of mosquitoes occurs during rainy season. Sullage is
disposed off in the backyards.
1.9.3 Health and Environment Aspects
There are no Village Water and Sanitation Committees to manage the water supply and its
treatment in a systematic manner. There is no Primary Health Centre in this Panchayat. Also,
there are no major recurring illness noticed.
1.9.4 Participation in new schemes
The villagers are ready to participate in the proposed project and contribute funds for the
facilities offered. There are a few self help groups in the Panchayat. In general, these groups
do not have adequate information on the types of activities that can be taken up. The main
activity of each group seems to be funding loans amongst themselves.
1.10 AMMAPATTI (Dindigul District)
Ammapatti Panchayat is located 12 km from Dindigul. It consists of 6 habitations namely:
Alamarathupatti, Ammapatti, Chinnaramapuram, Chockalingapuram, Devasagaiyapuram and
Melapatti. The overall population as per 2001 census is 1899.
The main source of water is from bore wells. Water is drawn by power pumps as well as
hand pumps. Water is pumped to an OHT of capacity 60,000 litres and is supplied through
public fountains and few house connections.
The main occupation of the people in the Village is used to be agriculture. Now a days, due
to falling of cultivation practice in the Panchayat, the villagers are! engaged as agricultural
labourers in other nearby villages.
1.10.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells fitted with hand pumps and power pumps. The
villagers complain of inadequate supply. The daily supply of water during normal periods is
50 lpcd, while it goes down to 15 lpcd during summer. Chlorination is done once in 20days.

Water is supplied mainly through public fountains. Some 10 families have house
connections. A charge of Rs. 1000 is collected as deposit and Rs. 30 per month for the water
supplied. For the remaining villagers who use the public fountains, the water is supplied free
of cost. This puts a burden on the Panchayat in paying the electricity charges to TNEB. The
operators have a basic level of education and have not been trained specially to undertake
the operation and maintenance of the pumpsets. Hence, they are capable of attending to
minor defects in the pumps like changing the fuse and checking minor leaks. The Panchayat
brings skilled persons from outside to fix major repairs.
1.10.2 Sanitation
There are no storm water drains constructed in the entire Panchayat. There are only a few
individual toilets in the entire Panchayat. These have been constructed by the villagers
themselves with no external aid. There are latrines constructed in schools. But only the
teachers have access to this facility. Also there is one community toilet, which is not being
used regularly due to lack of water for washing purposes.
1. 10.3 Health and Environment Aspects
There are no Village Water and Sanitation Committees to manage the water supply and its
treatment in a systematic manner. Some habitations are said to be affected by fluoride.
However, there are no major recurring health problems like Typhoid,, Jaundice, etc. noticed in
this Panchayat.
1.10.4 Participation in new schemes
Almost all the villagers have an aversion to make financial contribution to schemes. To
initiate contribution towards facilities, it would be better to educate the self-help groups in this
context and use them in turn to spread the information gained to the villagers. There are 6
Self-help groups in the Panchayat. In general, these groups do not have adequate
information on the types of activities that can be taken up. The main activity of each group
seems to be funding loans amongst themselves.
1.11 KANNADI KUPPAM (Vellore District)
Kannadi Kuppam Panchayat is located 6 km from Ambur. It consists of 4 habitations namely:
Kannadi Kuppam, New Colony, Old Colony and Ambedkar Nagar. The overall population as
per 2001 census is 1 159.
The main source of water is from bore wells. Water is drawn by power pumps as well as
hand pumps. Water is pumped to OHTs and is supplied through public fountains as well as
house connections.
A sizeable population of the village are employed as labourers in Tanneries at Ambur.

The water supplied in the village is affected with very high amount of TDS, due to untreated
effluent from tanneries contaminating the groundwater. Use of this water is reported to cause
several ailments of skin and hair, in addition to recurring cases of diahorrea.
1.11.1 Present water supply status
The water supply is mainly from borewells fitted with hand pumps and power purnps. The
villagers complain of inadequate supply and also that the water is qluality affected (very high
TDS). The daily supply of water during normal periods is 30 Ipcd, while it goes down to no
supply during sumrner. There are 13 borewells fitted with hand pumps, some of these are riot
being used due to high salinity. There are 2 overhead tanks of capacity 30,000 litres each
and one ground level tank of capacity 10,000 litres. Chlorination is done once in a fortnight.
Water is supplied mainly through public fountains. House connectiions have been provided
for 120 families. Initially (1987) when the HCs were being provided, the Panchayat had
collected a deposit of Rs.250 each for 38 houses, whereas recently (1996), 82 houses had
paid a deposit of Rs.1000. Those who had paid earlier were asked to make an additional
payment of Rs 750. But till now this amount was not collected. The villagers having HCs are
paying Rs.30 per month as water charges. For the remaining villaigers who use the public
fountains, the water is supplied free of cost. This puts a burden on the Panchayat in paying
the electricity charges to TNEB.
The Panchayat also pays Rs. 950 per month to 2 pump operators. The operators have a
basic level of education and have not been trained specially to undlertake the operation and
maintenance of the pumpsets. Hence, they are capable of attending to minor defects only.
The Panchayat brings skilled persons from outside to fix major repairs.
1.11.2 Sanitation
There are storm water drains constructed in several streets in the Panchayat. But these
drains only carry the sullage from houses and storm water to a low-lying plot in the
Panchayat. This plot has been obtained from an individual, on the condition that the dumping
would be stopped whenever he wants to build a house in the plot. There is a borewell fitted
with a hand pump in the nearby area and there is a risk of contamination of the source.
Drainage of storm water and sullage is a major problem identified.
There are only 20 individual toilets in the entire Panchayat. These have been constructed by
the villagers themselves with no external aid. There are latrines constructed in schools.
These are being used both by the teachers and students. It is proposed to build al separate
toilet for students. There are no public toilets built; Recently one community toilet exclusively
for women is under construction. This is being undertaken as per lthe interest of the SHGs.
The SHGs have owned the responsibility of maintenance of the comimunity toilet and will also
foot the charges for the electricity. In general, the priority of the villagers seems to be for
water supply project rather than toilets.

1.1 1.3 Health and Environment Aspects
There are no Village Water and Sanitation Committees to manage the water supply in a
systematic manner. All habitations are affected by high TDS. Some of the sources are saline.
Due to use of contaminated water, it is reported that some of the villagers suffer from
diseases of skin and hair. The nearest PHC sub-centre is at Vinnamangalam located 1km
away. It consists of one health nurse only. The villagers have to visit the PHC at Ambur to
consult with doctors.
1.11.4 Participation in new schemes
Initially, the villagers had an aversion to the idea of financial contribution to schernes. After
the consultations with the public, they are willing to make 10% contribution towards water
supply schemes. They even went to the extent of asking how soon the schernes would be
operational if they make their contribution immediately. Therefore, continuous IECs carried
out regularly would prepare the villagers to demand better facilities and also to take
ownership for the assets created and their maintenance.
There are 6 SHGs in the Panchayat, with as much as 20 members in each. They are
involved in small-savings by making monthly contributions. C)ne SHG, has initiated
construction of community toilets exclusively for women. They also are responsible for the
maintenance of the toilet and also for payment of electricity charges. In general, these groups
do not have adequate information on the types of activities that can be taken up.
From the group discussions as well as from secondary data, it is ascertained that the quality
of water in and around this village is getting deteorated due to tannery pollution. In fact, even
in this village one portion of the village is reported to be getting good quality of water and the
other part is not provided with good quality of water. The main issue connected with water
supply is:
a) Inadequate particularly during summer months and
b) Poor quality of water
In order to identify a possible good source for this village, it was ascertained from the
villagers that a source has been identified about 5km away from the village. During the site
inspection, a borewell has been drilled and necessary pumpset has been installed by the
Collectorate under a different program. Unfortunately, the above source has not been
brought into beneficial use. The villagers are of the opinion that the above source can be
utilized, subject to the fact that it satisfies the quality and quantity aspects. Incidentally, it was
also informed that the local MLA is prepared to contribute towards laying of pipeline
component alone. Without other facilities such as construction of OHT and pipelines effective
supply cannot be given to this village. Such being the case, it is rather difficult to take up this
scheme under this reform project. However, the TWAD board officials have infprmed that the
above village comes under the category of quality affected habitations. In as much as the
above programs comes under the regular budget of TWAD Board, the same can be taken up
to solve the water problem.

In order to assess the water quality problems in particular in some of the villages which are
located in and around this area, informal inspections were carried out to assess lthe same.
There is a Village Panchayat called Thuthipattu with a population of 10,000. the source for
this water supply scheme is from infiltration well situated in the River Malattar. A scheme was
formulated by TWAD Board as CWSS for providing water supply to Thuthipattu,
Chinnavarigam and Melvarigam. It was reported due to 0 & M problem apart from
inadequate source / quality problem, the water supply position in the above villages is bound
to be not satisfactory. In fact, during our inspection, villagers have informed that they are not
getting water supply for the past 2 months on account of practically nil water from the above
source. The above information was confirmed by the Consultant during the field inspection.
In this connection, the villagers have identified a different source, namely, an infiltration well
in River Malattar, which is not affected due to tannery effluent. Further, the villagers are
eager to remit money towards 10% contribution for providing water supply utilizing the above
source. Further, they are of the opinion that the above scherne should be proposed
exclusively for them only, since it was felt that the rest of the villages will create a problem in
sharing of water. In addition, during the earlier discussions, the above villagers were not
eager to contribute towards capital investment. Hence, they were not included under the
scope of this scheme.
In general the entire Palar river basin, particularly, areas which are near to Ambur
municipality are affected to a greater extent because of the tannery effluent. In fact, as
informed by the local people that the quality of the water is getting deteriorated in course of
time, which is a serious concern from the quality point of view. Apart from the above, on
account of poor rainfall conditions and little flow in the river, the quantity aspect also is
causing great concern. Hence, the habitations which dependant on Palar basin ishould be
taken special care in order to supply potable water.

Annex 5.1
Methodology for Quantitative Assessment Of Groundwater
To improve the quantitative assessment of groundwater, a methodology suggested by
groundwater over exploitation committee in the early eighties the GOI hadl constituted a committee for
considering all the aspects of groundwater estimation and for recommending methbdologies. The
committee submitted its report - GEC - 1984.  Since then the CGWB and State Groundwater
organizations have adopted the GEC - 1984 methodology and estimated the groundwater resource.
However some limitations were encountered in the estimation and this necessitated revision of
methodology for more accurate assessment. Therefore with a view to reviewing the GEC - 1984 and to
look into all the related issues a committee was constituted vide GOI, MO\WIR No. 3 / 9 / 93 - GW / 11 I
2333, dt 13.11.95.
The revised methodology GWREC - 1997 has incorporated number of changes comlpared to the
recommendation of GEC - 1984. In this methodology:
*  Watershed has been recommended as the assessment unit in hard rock areas.
*  Groundwater assessment has to be made separately for non - command and command areas of
poor quality have to be treated separately.
*  Groundwater recharge has to be assessed separately for monsoon and non-monsoon seasons.
*  An alternative methodology has been provided for estimation of specific yield based on
application of groundwater balance in dry season, which would be applicable in the non-
command part of hard rock areas.
* Norms for return flow from irrigation are now based on the source of irrigation i.e groundwater or
surface water, type of crops and depth to water table below ground level.
*  Groundwater levels have been made an integral part of groundwater assessment and
categorization of areas for groundwater development is now based on the stage of cgroundwater
development and long-term trend of groundwater levels.
*  Allocation for domestic and industrial water supply is now recommended based on population
density and relative load on groundwater for this purpose.
In Tamil Nadu the data in respect of different parameters and variables are not readily available to
carryout the computations on watershed basis as recommended in the GVNREC - 1997 methodology.
The work of data collection has already been taken up by State Ground and Surface Water Resources
Data Centre, Chennai. Hence computations have now been carried out with block as the assessment
unit and in the absence of data on command and non-command area, they hiave been estimated together
and then proportionately allocated.
*  Groundwater draft has been computed using both crop water requirement and unit draft method.
*  Groundwater draft has been computed on the basis of cropping pattern.
Annex- 5.1                                                               Page 1

*  The well census data has been compiled for each block from the block profile on irrigation
statistics published by Dept. of Economics and Statistics. The unit draft for different structures
used in the computation is given below.
Dug well                   0.7 Ha.m
Bore well                  1.0
Dug cum Bore well          1.0
Tube well                  2.0
RETURN FLOW FROM GROUNDWATER IRRIGATION:
Crop water requirement has been calculated on the basis of cropped area and average water
requirement. Return flow from groundwater irrigation has been computed oni the basis of the percentage
as per the methodology in relation to depth to water level in the irrigated areal.
In Tamil Nadu base flow has been assumed as nil as very few rivers are perennial.
In case of segregation of crystalline and sedimentary rocks, the percentage of each category was
separated for each block, canal seepage, seepage from tanks, return flow from surface water irrigation
were considered for recharge during monsoon and non-monsoon seasons.
ALLOCATION FOR DOMESTIC AND INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES
The population density (thousand per Sq.km) fractional load oln groundwater for domestic
purposes and area (Sq.km) has been used to determine the domestic demand.
The data on actual fractional load is not available for each block and according to TWAD Board
the share of groundwater (load on groundwater) for domestic water supply in rural and urban area is
taken as 0.7 and 0.3 respectively. In hilly areas the load is taken as 0.3. Accordingly the allocation for
domestic and industrial purposes has been computed.
For computing the groundwater resources, the recharge during monsoon was made after
normalization of rainfall recharge. The annual recharge net groundwater availability, potential for future
development and stage of development have been computed as per GWREC - 1997. Also the long term
trend during pre - monsoon and post monsoon water levels has been used.
ESTIMATION OF GROUNDWATER POTENTIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE METHODOLOGY
RECOMMENDED BY GWREC
The district wise and block wise groundwater potential and utilizable groundwater resource for 28
districts of Tamil Nadu were recalculated as per the GWREC - 1997. The block-wise groundwater
potential of Tamil Nadu as on Jan 1998 is furnished in Annexure- 1. The total dynamic groundwater
resource in Tamil Nadu is in the order of 23070.4251 Mcm (as on Jan 1998)

ESTIMATION OF STAGE OF GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION IN TAMIL NADU.
The increase in the development of groundwater is reflected in the block - wise assessment made
as on Jan 1998 and updated for Jan 2003 which revealed that out of 385 blocks, 138 blocks are over-
exploited, 37 blocks are critical, 105 blocks are categorized as safe. Out of 385 blocks, 8 blocks were
categorized as saline (100% saline areas) and 48 blocks are partially saline areas, which have been
excluded for groundwater estimation.
ASSESSMENT OF PRESENT AND ULTIMATE REQUIREMENT OF GROUNDWATER FOR
DOMESTIC AND INDUSTRIAL USES:
As per the National Water Policy, requirement for domestic water supply is to be accorded top
priority. This requirement has to be based on population as projected to the year 2025, per capita
requirement of water for domestic use, and relative load on ground water for urban and rural water
supply. The empherical relations recommended in the methodology is applied for the computations. The
data on actual practical load is not available for each block and TWAD Board, which is responsible for
water supply, informed that in general the load on groundwater for domestic water supply in rural & urban
area is taken as 0.7 and 0.3 respectively. In hilly areas, the load is taken as 0.3. Accordingly the
allocation for domestic and industrial needs have been computed.
Annex - 5.1                                                                Page 3

ESTIMATION OF GROUNDWATER RESOURCES AS ON JANUARY 2003
Groundwater resources have been computed as on January 1998 aind it has been suggested by
the State Level Working Group to update the estimates to January 2003. Net groundwater availability is
assumed to be the same and groundwater withdrawal has been projected on the pro-rata basis. In
computation of stage of development, groundwater draft for all purposes is to be considered. The
allocation for domestic and industrial purposes at year 25 has been considered as domestic draft. In
case of projection of irrigation draft, a uniform rate of 0.6% has been assumed in earlier computations.
However, it was felt that the groundwater development in different categories of blocks will not be same
and groundwater development will be least in the already over exploited block due to restriction on bank
financing. Accordingly, the block categorized as on January 1998 has been taken as a guiding factor to
allocate different growth rate as given below:
Block categorized as on January 1998  Growth rate in percentage per year
Safe                              0.4
Semi Critical                     0.3
Critical                          0.2
Over Exploited                    0.1
The long-term water level trend data for the period 1989 - 98 has been considered for
categorization of blocks as on January 1998. In the projection of estiimates to January 2003, the
long-term water level trend data for the period 1994 - 2003 has been considered

The incidence of ADD cases has a direct bearing on the quality of water and the
personal hygiene status of individuals handling water and food. It is seen from the
above table that there has been high incidence of ADD cases in Kanchipuram, Vellore,
Thiruvannamalai, Theni and Dindigul. However, the incidence of ADD cases as well as
deaths do not follow any definite trend during the past 5 years excepting that the cases
are consistently occurring year after year.

GDI is important for comparing the stages of gender development and to assess the
extent of gender equality. In this area, Tamil Nadu's achievement is better than the
attainment of the country as a whole, while within the State there is a symbiotic
correlation between human development and gender development indices. This
reinforces the view that human development is not an end in itself; rather it is necessary
to create an overall improvement in the condition of the people.
Employment, Income and Poverty
Employment: The working population of Tamil Nadu, 24.2 million in 1991, had
increased to 27.8 million in 2001.However, statistics reveal that the proportion of workers
to the total population had actually declined during the 40-year period of 1961-2001 from
45.7 percent to 44.8 percent, though there was an upward trend between 1981 and
2001,from 41.7 percent to 44.8 percent. What is disturbing is that the number of
marginal workers increased from 1.4 million in 1991 to 4.1 million in 2001.This implies
that the increase in the worker participation rate (WPR) was the result of an increasing
number of marginal workers rather than main workers. The Ihigher rate of worker
participation in the rural areas, as compared to the urban areas, has been a disquieting
trend, though the urban WPR accelerated at a faster rate when compared to the rural
WPR during the period 1981-2001.A positive feature was that female WPRs, in both
rural and urban areas, increased at a faster rate than male WPRs with the result that
total female workers increased from 31.4 percent in 1981 to 34.7 percent in 1991.
In sectoral terms, the primary sector is the major provider of emiployment. Though the
proportion of main workers in this sector decreased from more than 60 percent in 1961
to about 50 percent in 1999-2000, it is still the largest contributor to employment. In
1999-2000 the secondary sector accounted for 23.6 percent while the tertiary sector
accounted for 26.1 percent of employment.
Agriculture continues to be the primary source of bulk employment, though this is not
reflected in the income generated from the sector. Agricultural income declined over the
period 1993-4 to 1999-2000 from 24.82 percent to 18.16 percent, whereas the slhare of
income from the secondary and tertiary sectors improved in the same period. In per
capita terms, this means that the average output per worker in the primary sector
increased only marginally compared to the other sectors.
Income and Poverty: In 1996-7 the per capita income of Tamil Nadu was Rs.15,929 as
compared to the all India per capita income of Rs.1 1,554.This placed Tamil Nadu fifth
out of the 15 major States. (Maharashtra ranked first with Rs.19,098 followed by Punjab,
Haryana and Gujarat all with per capita incomes over Rs.15000). However, an analysis
of the situation within the State revealed wide differentials where Kanchipuram had a per
capita income of Rs.23075, three times more than Villupuram, which was among the

lowest in the State. It would be generally expected that a district with high per capita
income should also have better education and health standards. But a closer
examination of the data available shows that this does not always hold true. While
Chennai with a high per capita income has a high level of literacy, districts like Salem
and Erode which have relatively high-income levels have quite low literacy levels. The
same situation can be found in the area of health.
Poverty levels, relatively static at well above the 50 percent levell during the 1970s and
80s witnessed a dramatic decrease since then. From 45.80 percent in 1987-88 it
declined to 32.48 percent in 1993-4 and further to 21.12 perc:ent in 1999-2000.The
estimated number of people living below the poverty line in 1999-.2000 was 13.05 million
of which 8.05 million were in the rural areas and 5 million in the urban areas. Poverty
levels declined from about 32 percent to 20 percent in the rural areas, while the decline
in the urban areas was from about 39.77 percent to 22.11 percent making the two levels
of poverty almost equal. Region wise estimates show that poverty levels have been
especially high in Chennai at 44.23 percent, while the Coastal region shows 21.09
percent living below the poverty line. Among the social groups also it was found that
greater poverty levels exist among the Schedule Castes and Tribes, where 56.30
percent of urban households and 33.38 percent of rural households live below the
poverty line.

Demography, Health and Nutrition
In Tamil Nadu, an analysis of the decennial growth of population in the State from 1901
to 2001 shows a population growth of over three times. After 19Il, the population grew
sharply but since 1970 birth rates have fallen significantly.
From the 1980s, both birth and death rates have shown a sustained decline. Between
1971 and 2000 the State's Crude Birth Rate (CBR) declined 39 percent from 31.4 to 9.3
per 1000, more than the national rate of 30 percent. Birth rates declined rapidly since
1980 and in 10 years reached about 20.3, but since 1993 there has been a le velirig off of
the natural growth rate of population in the State. The decline in death rates was not so

impressive and came down to 7.9 per 1000 in 2000 from 14.4 in 1971.1n recent times the
gap in the rural-urban divide has been narrowing with the rural birth rate at 21 as
compared to 19 for urban while the rural death rate stood at 8.8, compared to 6.6 for
urban.
Tamil Nadu's sex ratio has improved from 974 to 986 in the period 1991-2001 and it is
much higher than the national average. The adverse ratio is, nevertheless, a matter of
concern. Rural sex ratios are higher than urban ones all over India and Tamil Nadu is no
different. According to SRS, life expectancy at birth for Tamil Nadu for 1996-2001 was
65.2 years for males and 67.6 for females. It is significant that in all districts female LEB
exceeded male LEB and in 10 of the 29 districts female LEB was over 70 years.
Literacy and Education
While the overall literacy rate had gone up from 62.7 percent in 1991 to 73.47 in 2001,
male literacy level grew even more from 73.75 percent to 82.33 percent in the same
period. Equally encouraging was the growth in the literacy rate for females, which went
up from 51.33 percent in 1991 to 64.55 percent in 2001.The ratio of male literacy to
female literacy also came down from 1.4 in 1991 to 1.27 in 2001, indicating a narrowing
of the gender inequality ratio in the State. Despite this, wide disparity exists in the
districts where gender and social groupings appear to make a difference. This gender
discrimination, evident in almost all districts and the low level of rural literacy rates need
careful analysis and appropriate strategies.
