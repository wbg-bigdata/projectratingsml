SCHEDULE 2 
Actions Referred to in Recital (C) of the Preamble to this Agreement 
1. 
The Federal Budget 2002 forecasts an overall Fiscal Deficit of 0.65 percent of the 
Gross Domestic Product for Fiscal Year 2002, as said Gross Domestic Product is 
estimated in the 
Criterios Generales de Política Económica 
2002, published by the 
Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público 
(the Borrower’s Secretariat of Finance and 
Public Credit) in November 2001.  
 
2. 
The Federal Budget 2002 has increased for Fiscal Year 2002 the programmable 
expenditures (
gastos programables
)
for education, health, social safety nets, and 
economic infrastructure by at least 0.8  percentage points of the Gross Domestic Product 
with respect to Fiscal Year 2001. For purposes of this paragraph, “economic 
infrastructure” means roads and facilities for the generation, transmission, transformation 
and distribution of electricity. 
 
3. 
The Income Tax Law:  
 
(a) 
(i) 
eliminates the special cash-flow tax regime (which regime 
consisted of registering the income in cash and deducting from said income the 
expenditures in cash, and deducting investments in a single year at a rate of 100%) for 
those taxpayers referred to in Article 79 of the Income Tax Law; and (ii) substitutes said 
regime with a cash-basis regime, which regime consists of registering the income in cash 
and deducting from said income: (A) the expenditures that are paid in cash (i.e, labor, 
utilities, rental and raw material costs as mentioned in Articles 123 through 126 of the 
Income Tax Law); and (B) the cost of investments in fixed-assets through the application 
of either the straight-line depreciation method or the immediate tax deduction method as 
defined in paragraph (c) below for purposes of eliminating the deduction of: (1) the cost 
of investments in financial assets; and (2) excess estimates of the cost of investments in 
fixed-assets; 
 
(b) 
substitutes the inflation adjustment regime with a simplified mechanism 
for determining the cumulative and deductible inflation applicable to financial assets and 
liabilities, as provided in Articles 46 through 48 of the Income Tax Law; 
 
(c) 
introduces an immediate tax deduction method, which method consists of 
the deduction of the net present value of the future straight-line capital depreciation 
discounted at the annual rate of 6% for taxpayers which are legal entities and individuals 
carrying out business and professional activities, with respect to new fixed assets 
investments outside the metropolitan areas of Monterrey, Guadalajara and Mexico City, 
or anywhere within the Borrower’s territory, provided that - in the latter case - the 
production activity of said taxpayers is labor intensive, uses clean technologies with 
Page  15
-
14 - 
respect to the emission of pollutants and does not require significant use of water, as 
provided in Articles 220 and 221 of the Income Tax Law; 
 
(d) 
establishes a limit on tax deductions by legal entities with respect to 
fringe benefits (
gastos de previsión social)
 paid to non-union workers (
empleados de 
confianza
)
as referred to in Article 31-XII of the Income Tax Law, which limit consists of  
the lower of 10% of the taxable income of each of said workers or an amount equivalent 
to the annual minimum wage for said workers; 
 
(e) 
(i) 
eliminates the reduced tax rate for reinvested profits; (ii) 
eliminates the 5% withholding tax rate for dividends; (iii) unifies the tax rates applicable 
for legal entities and individuals at 35% for Fiscal Year 2002; and (iv) provides for the 
gradual reduction of said tax rates to 32% by Fiscal Year 2005, as referred to in Articles 
10 and LXXXII Transitory (
Transitorio)
 of
the Income Tax Law;   
 
(f) 
gradually phases out the tax reduction percentage for the publishing 
industry by Fiscal Year 2006, as provided in Article LXVII Transitory (
Transitorio)
 of 
the Income Tax Law; 
 
(g) 
expands the taxable income base of individuals to include: (i) the real 
interest (
intereses reales
 
–
which interest is defined as the amount of said interest which 
exceeds the adjusted inflation as determined in accordance with the mechanism set forth 
in Article 159 of the Income Tax Law) earned on bonds issued by the Borrower or legal 
entities, as referred to in said Article; (ii) dividends and profits as provided in Article 165 
of the Income Tax Law; and (iii) capital gains on stock with the exceptions contemplated 
in Article 109-XXVI of the Income Tax Law; 
 
(h) 
(i) 
reduces the Borrower’s income tax subsidy (
crédito al salario
)
by up to 3% of each employer’s payroll; and (ii) creates an option for employers to either: 
(A) pay a new 3% tax applicable to the entire employer’s payroll; or (B) absorb as a cost 
the income tax subsidy of up to 3% of the entire employer’s payroll (calculated as set 
forth in the Income Tax Law);  
 
(i) 
reduces the number of tax rate brackets for individuals and harmonizes 
the maximum rate applied to said individuals with the tax rate referred to in paragraph (e) 
(iii) above; and 
 
(j) 
simplifies the tax regime of the individuals who carry out business 
activities (
actividades empresariales
)
as follows: (i) individuals who only sell goods or 
render services to the general public (other than those individuals who fall within the 
exception referred to in Article 137, paragraph 4, of the Income Tax Law)  whose annual 
gross revenues in the previous Fiscal Year resulting from the carrying out of said 
activities and interest earned do not exceed $1,500,000 Mexican Pesos, may pay a one 
percent (1%) presumptive tax on said gross revenue (Articles 137 through 140 of the 
Income Tax Law); (ii) individuals who carry out business activities exclusively and 
Page  16
-
15 - 
whose annual gross revenues in the previous Fiscal Year do not exceed $4,000,000 
Mexican Pesos (Articles 134 through 136 of the Income Tax Law) may calculate their
