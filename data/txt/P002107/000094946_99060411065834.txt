IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
MULTISTATE ROADS PROJECT (CREDIT 2415-UNI)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Multi-State Roads Project in
Nigeria, for which Credit 2415-UNI in the original amount of SDR 49.8 million (US$ 68.0 million
equivalent) was approved on July 21, 1992, and made effective on August 10, 1993.
The credit was closed on June 30, 1998. The last disbursement took place on November
20, 1998, and the final balance of the credit in the amount of SDR 811,747.19 (US$ 1.1 million
equivalent) was canceled on January 5, 1999. A previous cancellation was made on September
25, 1995, amounting to SDR 21,719,503.14 (US$32.3 million), representing the initial allocation
to Jigawa State.
Mr. Dieter Schelling, Team Leader, TWUTD, and Mr. Okwudili Ikejiani, Infrastructure
Engineer, prepared the ICR. The report was edited by Farida Khan, Operations Analyst, AFTT2,
and reviewed by Mr. Yaw Ansu, Country Director for Nigeria.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's supervision mission in March 1998.
An implementation completion mission was held in October 1998 when all the major construction
sites were visited and completion of works was confirmed. Material from the Borrower's PMU
and the Bank's project files were also used to prepare this report. The aide memoire of the
implementation completion mission and the Borrower's Evaluation Report (Kano State) are
attached to this ICR. No comments were received from the Borrower on this report.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
MULTI-STATE ROADS PROJECT (CREDIT 2415-UNI)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.    Introduction:  Agreements for the first multi-state roads credit of SDR 49.8 for Kano
and Jigawa States were signed on November 11, 1992 and became effective on August 10, 1993.
The credit was seen as a first operation in a series of multi-state roads projects which would
eventually cover the entire country. An early misuse of the special account in both Kano and
Jigawa States led to the cancellation of the Jigawa component of the project, after the latter failed
to take quick action to restore the money. Kano, in turn, quickly rectified the issue, and
completed its component timely and satisfactorily. This ICR forthwith considers only the Kano
and the federal oversight components of the project.
2.    Bank's Role in the Road Sector:  The Bank/IDA's past involvement in Nigeria's
transport sector has totaled US$ 469 million. These investments tended to be patchy, partly
related to repair of damage suffered during the civil war, and were not based on an agreed
transport sector strategy resulting from  a sector dialogue.   They also suffered from
implementation delays and lack of success of the institutional development components. As a
consequence, the completed Highway Sector Loan, the Multi-State Road Project and the on-
going Second Multi-State Roads Project were designed with substantial technical assistance
components with the objective of building up institutional capacity.
3.    Project Objectives and Components: The main objective of the project was to support
a sustainable improvement program for high priority state roads by: (a) creating a capacity for
planning and management of the state road system, including strengthening of the State Ministry
of Works and Transport (SMOWT); and (b) developing a road upgrading, rehabilitation and
maintenance program, and increasing the use of private contractors.
4.    Credit Covenants and Special Agreements: Project objectives were reinforced by
covenants concerning project and road sector finance, and a requirement of a mid-term review by
the SMOWT, the Federal Highway Department (FHD), Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and
the Bank.
5.    Evaluation of Project Objectives and Covenants: Project objectives were clear and
highly relevant to safeguard investments made into the state road network. Covenants regarding
at-source deduction of counterpart funding were effective in ensuring sufficient counterpart
allocation to the project.



- ii -
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
6.    Assessment of Project's Success and Sustainability:  The project managed to
rehabilitate the essential parts of the badly deteriorated state road network which connects some
of the highest producing agricultural areas in Kano State to the federal road network and to the
state capital. Substantial institutional capacity was built up within the State Ministry of Works
and Transport (SMOWT) to manage the state road network. The government agreed to keep the
at-source deduction in place to finance the on-going maintenance program. However, the long-
term survival of this system is not assured unless a planned major reform of road management and
finance becomes effective at the national level.
7.    Summary of Costs and Financing Arrangements: Final disbursement from the credit
account amounts to US$ 37.8 million. Total counterpart contribution amounts to Naira 523
million (US$ 8.8 million equivalent), which is 19 percent of the total project cost, applying
historic exchange rates, as compared to the planned 26 percent in the SAR.
8.    Implementation Schedule: The actual project implementation period was August 1993
to October 31, 1998. Despite the difficult political and economic environment, all, but one,
rehabilitation contracts were completed by the closing date of June 30, 1998. For this particular
contract, an exceptional extension until October 31, 1998 was given, the date of the end of the
grace period for the submission of withdrawal applications.
9.   Analysis of Key Factors Affecting Major Objectives: The artificial pegging of the
exchange rate (until the end of 1994) made project management difficult and led to the early
misuse of the special account. There was a chronic shortage of bitumen in the country with
delaying consequences for the project due to the government's policies that frustrated domestic
production and disallowed importation. Easing of import restriction one year before closure
allowed completion of all works in time.
10.   Assessment of the Borrower's and Bank's Performance: In view of the profound
changes that Nigeria experienced since identification of the project in 1989, and the considerable
and timely achievements of the project, the performance of both the Borrower and the Bank in the
preparation and implementation of the project is judged satisfactory.
11.   Assessment of Project's Outcome: The outcome of the project is judged as satisfactory,
in view of its substantial physical achievements and the successful build up of local capacity to
manage the state road network. Although the long-term sustainability of this capacity is doubtful,
the project contributed, through the restructured federal oversight component, to a road
management and finance reform initiative at national level, which will, if implemented, greatly
enhance sustainability.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS AND KEY LESSONS LEARNT
12.   Based on the experience made with the implementation of this and other recent road
sector projects in Nigeria, it has become clear that the existing institutional and financing set up
for road management in Nigeria is not viable. There are currently about eight hundred agencies at
all levels of government responsible for road management. All of them suffer from the exposure
to political whims, are over-staffed, have underpaid, poorly trained and unmotivated staff, use
antiquated work methods and are hampered by bureaucratic procedures. Fundamental
restructuring of road sector management and finance is required in order to achieve sustainability.
13.   Based on this experience, the federal government oversight component of the project was
restructured in 1996, to assist a joint private sector/government road sector reform initiative
called Road Vision 2000 (RV2000). A framework for the reform, including a draft decree for the
formation of a National Roads Board and a Road Fund was presented to the Cabinet in February
1999.
14.   Adoption of the reform could present the basis for a resumption of Bank lending in the
road sector in Nigeria, preferably through a carefully timed adjustable lending program with
agreed upon benchmarks. Finance could consist of investments to cover part of the road recovery
program, provision of guarantees for private sector road management concessions, and funding
for the rehabilitation of the badly deteriorated rural roads network.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
MULTI-STATE ROADS PROJECT (CREDIT 2415-UNI)
Part I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
1.    INTRODUCTION
A.    Country Environment
1.    The project period (1993-1998) witnessed severe political and economic instability. An
aborted election in June 1994 led to severe unrest in the country and to international sanctions.
The nation's economy further declined during the period. GNP per capita decreased from US$
340 in 1993 to US$ 260 in 1998. Income inequality increased, and 34 percent of the population
are now classified as "poor." Basic social indicators place Nigeria among the 20 poorest
countries worldwide. As a consequence of the economic crisis, the project suffered from serious
and long lasting shortages of petroleum products, in particular bitumen and diesel.
B.    Bank's Role in the Transport Sector
2.    The Bank/IDA's past assistance to Nigeria's transport sector has totaled twelve projects
and amounted to US$ 469 million (eleven loans and one credit), of which US$ 354 million (76%)
was allocated to the roads and the rest to the railway and ports sub-sectors. Details of past
lending to the transport sector are listed in Table 2. These investments (with the exception of the
recently completed Highway Sector Loan) tended to be patchy, partly related to the repair of
damage suffered during the civil war, and were not based on an agreed transport sector strategy
resulting from a sector dialogue. They also suffered from implementation delays and lack of
success of the institutional development components. As a consequence, the Highway Sector
Loan, the first Multi-State Roads and the on-going Second Multi-State Roads projects were
designed with substantial technical assistance components with the objective of building up
institutional capacity.
3.    A proposed Railway Restructuring Project and a Lagos Urban Transport Project prepared
in the early nineties would have required major policy changes. Both projects were shelved due to
lack of progress regarding these necessary changes.
2.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
A.    Original Project Objectives
4.    Originally, six states, Anambra, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Niger and Oyo were selected by
the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) for inclusion in the proposed Multi-States Roads
Project (MSRP) program, based on their capacity to meet the local costs of road programs and
their willingness to reorient roads expenditure from expansion to maintenance, upgrading and
strengthening. The number of states was later reduced to three, Kano, Lagos and Oyo. With the



- 2 -
creation of nine additional states in August 1991, Kano and Oyo were subdivided into
Kano/Jigawa and Oyo/Osun, respectively. In order to keep this first MSRP at a manageable size,
it was decided to limit it to two states, Jigawa and Kano.
5.    The main objective of the proposed project was to support a sustainable improvement
program for high priority state roads by: (a) creating a capacity for planning and management of
the state road system, including strengthening of the State Ministries of Works and Transport
(SMOWT); and (b) developing a road upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance program, and
increasing the use of private contractors.
B.    Project Description and Components
6.    The project included the following components:
a) Road maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening: an econornically justified program to
reduce the backlog of rehabilitation and strengthening works on about 830 km of priority state
roads;
b) Road upgrading: paving about 220 km of selected high priority, heavily trafficked unpaved
roads to appropriate design standards;
c) Vehicle and equipment: procurement of vehicles and equipment as an aid for better
management of roads; and
d) Institutional development: development of staff capabilities for planning, design and
supervision of construction and maintenance of state roads; staff would be assisted to put this
into practice by moving towards greater use of contractors and away from force account
operations.
C. Credit Covenants and Special Agreements
7.    Project objectives were reinforced by covenants concerning project and state road sector
finance, as follows:
a) the putting in place of a mechanism for transfer of local counterpart funds from the
Federation Account to the project account of each state (at-source deduction);
b) an action plan prepared by the participating states to increase the road user charges
under their jurisdiction to recover at least the cost of recurrent maintenance;
c) no expenditures on roads outside the project will be undertaken by the states in excess
of US$ 5 million without consultation with the Bank;
d) at least Naira 9,500,000 and Naira 8,000,000 equivalent will be allocated annually in
the Kano and Jigawa state budget respectively for recurrent maintenance of state
roads;



- 3 -
e) opening by each participating state of a Project Account with an initial deposit of at
least Naira 2 million in a commercial bank and thereafter deposit in each month one
twelfth of the annual counterpart requirement (being 25 percent of total project cost).
Additionally, it was required to hold annual exchange of views by relevant government agencies
and the Bank to assess progress and review of work program and budgetary allocations.
D. Evaluation of Project Objectives and Covenants
8.    Project objectives were clear and highly relevant to safeguard investments made into the
state road network. Despite delays due to persistent shortages of petroleum products in the
country, the Kano-component of the project was completed within the initially allocated time.
Covenants regarding at-source deduction of counterpart funding were very effective in ensuring
sufficient counterpart allocation to the project. A temporary shortfall of counterpart funding was
experienced after the de-facto devaluation of the Naira by 400 percent in 1994. Additional
Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) funding closed the gap and in June 1997 the counterpart funding
contribution from the State Federation account was increased from Naira 4 million to Naira 9
million per month. Covenants regarding increased road user charges and sufficient budget
allocation for recurrent maintenance were not very realistic (no linkage exists between road user
charges and budget allocation) and not based on a thorough analysis of state finance management
and procedures.
3. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
A.   Assessment of Project's Success and Sustainability
Cancellation of the Jigawa Component of the Project
9.    Unauthorized transfers amounting to US$800,000 were made from the special account in
both Kano and Jigawa State soon after the project became effective (see paragraph 17). IDA
threatened suspension if the amounts were not transferred back to the special account and Kano
rapidly complied and transferred the ineligible amount back. A newly appointed Government in
Jigawa, decided that it no longer wanted the project. However, it did not request cancellation of
its portion of the credit, nor did it transfer back the ineligible amount taken from the special
account. In August 1995, the Federal Ministry of Finance eventually returned the ineligible
amount to the credit account, and the remaining balance of the Jigawa component of the project
amounting to SDR 21,719,503.14 was cancelled on September 25, 1995.
10.   Since the Jigawa portion was cancelled without any significant disbursement (other than
the initial allocation to the special account) and without commencement of implementation of its
component of the project, this report will forthwith only consider the Kano State and the federal
oversight components of the project.
Road Improvement
11.   Rehabilitation Contracts: Under the project, three sets of priority roads totaling 413 km
(60 percent of the total state road network) were rehabilitated in ten major contracts. Out of the



- 4 -
413 km, 245 km (59 %) were executed to asphalt concrete (AC) standard (50mm overlay) and
168 km (41 %), to double surface dressed (SD) standard. Works essentially consisted of repair or
removal of the existing SD, occasionally replacement of the base layer, construction of additional
culverts and placement of a SD or AC surface. Average per kilometer costs for the rehabilitation
of the completed roads amounted to US$ 90,700 equivalent (without design and supervision
costs). Quality of these roads is satisfactory and costs are moderate to low, particularly when
compared to costs in neighboring countries. Average economic rate of return (ERR) of all the
completed road sections has been calculated at 33 percent using the HDM-III model as against
the initially assumed ERR of 48 percent (see Table 8). The reduced ERR is partly due to
increased scope of work on certain roads, and to lower than expected traffic growth.
12.   Design and Supervision of Works: All roads rehabilitated, were designed and supervised.
by qualified local consultants. In all, 487 km were designed out of which 403 km were
rehabilitated and supervised by local consultants (eight contracts). Ten kilometers of roads were
designed and supervised in-house by the Ministry staff. Thanks to the existence of a well
developed consultant industry in Nigeria and adherence to proper procurement procedures, the
selected local consultants were of good quality and performed satisfactorily.
Road Maintenance
13.   Amounts as specified in the project covenants (see paragraph 7(d)) were initially allocated
in the annual budgets for recurrent maintenance. However, these amounts were later not
sufficiently adjusted to inflation. In view of the general scarcity of resources at state level, it was
agreed with Government that these amounts would be used for urgent repair and maintenance of
the urban roads in Kano city, while project funding (the at-source deduction from the federal
account and later PTF funding) would be used for state road maintenance outside the city area. A
five-year routine and recurrent maintenance program was prepared by SMOWT for the years
1996 to 2000, covering the entire state road network of 871 km. Based on this plan, four term
maintenance contracts were prepared and signed with contractors covering four zones of
approximately 200 km each, for a total amount of Naira 84 million (US$ 1 million equivalent) and
were implemented successfully in 1997/98. A ten-year routine and periodic maintenance program
for the period 1999-2008 was prepared towards the end of the project. The government pledged
to keep the at-source deduction (Naira 9 million per month) dedicated to the maintenance of the
state road network. However, in view of the scarcity of funds at state level, it is doubtful that this
arrangement will hold in the long-term, short of an overall reform of road maintenance finance in
Nigeria (see paragraph 25 - 27).
Institutional Development
14.   In order to build up institutional capacity within the SMOWT and to assist to execute the
project, a contract was signed with an international consultant (STAC). Within SMOWT a Project
Management Unit (PMU) was set up comprising the Commissioner, the Project Coordinator, the
Project Accountant, a core of seven permanent Ministry's staff and STAC members. PMU staff
was intensively trained on-the job, through STAC organized seminars and workshops, and in
specialized overseas training courses. The PMU was effective in procuring and managing the
rehabilitation contracts, in planning and executing maintenance activities, quick processing of



- 5 -
interim payment certificates and in reporting and monitoring activities. The Government has
pledged to keep the PMU functioning for the continued execution of the maintenance program.
However, short of an overall reform of road management in Nigeria (see paragraph 25 - 27), the
long-term effectiveness and survival of the PMU is doubtful.
Federal Oversight Component
15.   Originally this project was seen as the first in a series of Multi-State Road Projects
(MSRP) which would eventually cover the entire country. The Federal Ministry of Works and
Housing (FMWH) was seen as the apex agency for these MSRPs. In order to support the
FMWH in its coordination efforts, a Federal Technical Assistant Coordinator (FEDTAC) was
employed under a federal component of the project. When it became clear that after the second.
MSRP (Oyo and Osun States) no further similar projects would be financed by the Bank, this
contract was converted into a Concession Study executed in the framework of the Road Vision
2000 (RV2000) Initiative (see paragraph 26).
B.    Summary of Costs and Financing Arrangements
16.   The original Credit Agreement dated November 11, 1992, called for the client to finance
the foreign exchange expenditures of certain categories. This proved unrealistic, and Schedule I,
of the Credit Agreement was later adjusted to ensure that the client would only have to cover
local currency expenditures.
17.   Special Accounts were opened at commercial banks with an authorized allocation of US$
1 million per state. These amounts were deposited on November 1, 1993. On November 18,
1993, both Kano and Jigawa States transferred an amount of US $800,000 from the special to the
project account at the then official exchange rate of Naira 22 to the Dollar (while the legal parallel
market rate was at Naira 80 to the Dollar). After this unauthorized transfer, IDA threatened
suspension of the Project if the amounts were not paid back in due course. After a change in
Government, Kano State rectified the situation by transferring the amount of US$800,000 back to
the special account, while the new leadership in Jigawa State decided that they no longer wanted
the project. However, it did not request cancellation of its portion of the credit, nor did it
transfer back the ineligible amount taken from the special account. In August 1995, the Federal
Ministry of Finance eventually returned the ineligible amount to the credit account, and the
remaining balance of the Jigawa component of the project amounting to SDR 21,719,503.14
(US$ 32.3 million equivalent) was cancelled on September 25, 1995.
18.   Final disbursement from the Credit Account amounts to US $37.8 million. As per the
Credit Agreement, the counterpart contribution from the government was to be 26% of the
project cost. Actual total counterpart contribution amounted to Naira 299 million from the State
Government (at-source deduction from the federal account) and Naira 224 million from the
Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund with a total of Naira 523 million (US$ 8.8 million equivalent) or
19% of the total project cost.



-6 -
C.   Implementation Schedule
19.   The actual project implementation period was August 1993 to June 30, 1998. Despite the
difficult political and economic environment described earlier, all but one rehabilitation contracts
were completed by the closing date. For this particular contract an exceptional extension was
granted for the continuation of works during the grace period for the submission of withdrawal
applications (for works and services completed prior to the closing date) until October 31, 1998.
Similar extensions were granted to some of the consultants' contracts.
D.   Analysis of Key Factors Affecting Major Objectives
20.   Availability of Petroleum Products: The failure of the government to restructure the
petroleum sector and its resistance to allow importation of bitumen and fuel led to extended
shortages of these products causing serious delays in the execution of the project. Starting in
1997, import restrictions eased and the supply situation improved considerably, just in time to
allow completion of the project prior to closing.
E.   Assessment of the Borrower's and the Bank's Performance
21.  In hindsight one could judge that the project design was not very innovative regarding
modern approaches to road management and finance. However, it must be acknowledged that at
the time of project identification (1989) the Nigerian economy and institutions were in a much
better shape than they are today, and that the African Road Maintenance Initiative (RMI) which
promotes reform of road management and finance was still in its infancy. In view of the above and
in view of the considerable and timely achievements of the project, the performance of both the
Borrower and the Bank in the identification/preparation/appraisal and implementation/ supervision
of the project is judged satisfactorily.
F.    Assessment of Project's Outcome
22.   The outcome of the project is judged as satisfactory. Improvements on the selected roads
which serve important agricultural production areas in the state, and which carry considerable
traffic despite fuel shortages, have achieved high economic rates of return. As a result of the
competitive market in Nigeria and adherence to Bank procurement procedures, construction costs
were acceptable and quality of works satisfactory. A Project Management Unit (PMU) was
created with a core of seven SMOWT staff in order to reduce the effect of poor institutional
arrangement within SMOWT. The core unit was responsible for developing a state road network
data base and to prepare maintenance programs based on sound economic analysis.  New
procedures were developed for the execution of routine and recurrent maintenance programs by
contract (Term Maintenance Contracts) and were successfully implemented.  Through the
restructuring of the federal oversight component of the project a national road management and
finance reform initiative was successfully supported.  Without adoption of this reform (as
described in the next chapter), however, long-term sustainability of the achievements is not
assured.

4. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS AND KEY LESSONS LEARNT
A.   Important Findings of Project Implementation Experience
23.   The decision to follow up on the Highway Sector Loan, which supported the Federal
Highway Department to maintain the federal trunk road system, with projects that would support
the states in maintaining their road network assets, was essentially a sound one. At the design
stage of the project it was impossible to predict the general political, economic and institutional
decline that Nigeria underwent during this decade.  The politically motivated continued
subdivision of states and local governments further undermined the declining institutional capacity
to manage the roads at the various levels of government.
24.   The above led to a situation where it is clear that the existing institutional and financing set
up for road management in Nigeria is no longer viable. There are about eight hundred agencies at
all levels of government responsible for road management (36 federal agencies, one in each state,
responsible for the federal network, 36 state roads agencies, and more than 700 local government
works departments). All of them suffer from the exposure to political whims, are over-staffed,
have underpaid, low trained and unmotivated staff, use antiquated work methods and are
hampered by bureaucratic procedures. Fundamental restructuring of road sector management and
finance is required in order to achieve sustainability.
25.   Attempts at reform of road management in Nigeria have a long history. At a workshop
held in June 1995 - the birth of the Road Vision 2000 Initiative (RV2000), it was resolved to
create the following:
*  an autonomous road agency to be called National Roads Board (NRB) with a majority of
private sector road user representatives on its Board;
•  a Road Fund, financed mainly from a fuel levy, to be managed by NRB;
*  an enabling environment for private sector participation in managing and financing of roads in
Nigeria.
26.   Three studies, financed from the restructured federal oversight components of the two
Multi-State Roads Projects, were commissioned in support of the reform initiative: (i) a
framework study, defining the legal framework (the Roads Board Decree) for the NRB; (ii) a
network study, assessing the condition of the Nigerian road network and defining the maintenance
and rehabilitation requirements based on economic criteria; and (iii) a concession study, assessing
the feasibility of a private sector maintenance and rehabilitation concession on the Lagos to
Ibadan expressway. Final reports of these studies were submitted in November 1998.
27.   A Steering Committee (SC) reflecting the future board of NRB was created, overseeing
the execution of the studies and conducting information campaigns in order to promote the
reform. In December 1998, the SC presented to Government a blueprint report on the reform,
including a draft National Roads Board Decree. In February 1999, the blueprint was presented
to the Cabinet by the current Federal Minister of Works and Housing, who is a strong supporter
of the reform initiative.

B.    Future Operations and Sustainability
28.   As mentioned earlier, a Project Management Unit (PMU) was created within SMOWT
comprising the Commissioner for Works, the Project Coordinator, the Project Accountant and a
core of seven permanent Ministry staff. The government has pledged to keep the PMU intact for
future management of the road network. Furthermore, the government has pledged to keep the
at- source deduction amounting to Naira 9 million per month available for road maintenance,
which would be sufficient to cover the cost of maintaining the rehabilitated network. Recently,
the former Commissioner for Works has been elected Vice-Governor of Kano State, which gives
some assurance that the above pledges will be kept for time being. However, short of radical
improvements of the civil service conditions (an engineer earns less than US$ 100 equivalent per
month) and given the general shortage of funds on state level, the above arrangements are unlikely
to survive in the long term, and only an overall reform of road management and finance, as
described in the previous section, would ensure long-term sustainability.
C.   Lessons for Future Projects in the Sector
29.   The following main lessons can be drawn from the implementation of this project for
possible future operations in the road sector:
* Nigeria is blessed with a strong private sector, including numerous experienced highly capable
road contractors and engineering consultants. Through the strict application of the Bank's
procurement procedures, particularly pre-qualification based on appropriate criteria and short-
listing, unqualified firms can be weeded out and quality and moderately priced works and
services can be achieved.
* Through adequate incentives, including the provision of training, motivated project
management units can be created to execute projects. However, their long-term survival
within the current civil service structure is highly doubtful.
• The current set-up for the management and financing of roads in Nigeria is not viable. Any
future engagement of the Bank in the road sector in Nigeria should only be considered after
the successful implementation of the reforms proposed under the Road Vision 2000 Initiative,
which are: (i) the creation of an independent National Roads Board (NREB), with a majority of
private sector representatives; (ii) setting-up of a Road Fund managed by NRB; and (iii)
management of area road networks (including federal, state and local government roads)
through private sector road management consultants or State Road Boards.
30.   After the enactment of the National Roads Board and Road Fund Decree, the Bank should
assist, possibly through a trust fund, preparatory activities for the implementation of the reform.
Thereafter, an APL (Adaptable Program Lending) might be the right tool to carefully re-engage
the Bank and to expand our possible involvement based on clearly defined and agreed upon
benchmarks.
31.   Possible Bank/IDA financing could cover initial years' peak demand of a road recovery
program, provision of guarantees for private sector road management concessions, and funding



-9-
for the rehabilitation of the badly deteriorated rural road network. A community based rural
infrastructure program could, by means of a rural development or social fund, assist the
communities to improve their near-village transport infrastructure (besides financing non-
transport rural infrastructure, based on the priorities of the communities).
32.   For the time being, the Bank should focus on assisting Nigeria to implement the reforms
proposed under Road Vision 2000, and should not consider new lending in the road sector unless
these reforms are adopted and functioning.

Main variances between appraisal estimates and actuals: In certain cases a substantial change in the scope of works
and related changes in cost has led to lower ERRs after completion. This applies to Bichi-Gwarzo and Kano-Challawa
Roads. After the appraisal in 1991, another trafric count was conducted in 1994 to agree on the 1" and 2 nd priority
road rehabilitation program. Note that the traffic count conducted in 1998 after the rehabilitation works was not
representative of the true traffic situation because of prolonged acute shortage of diesel and petrol in Kano and all over
the country. For this reason (the shortage of fuel) nothing was subtracted from the benefits in the ex-post ERR
calculations, even though only about 50% of the costs are recovered directly from the users.

Nigeria
Multi-State Roads Project (MSRP-I) - Kano State Component
Implementation Completion Mission
Aide Memoire
October 26, 1998
I. Introduction
1.    A  World Bank implementation completion mission consisting of Messrs. Dieter
Schelling (Team Leader), Okwudili Ikejiani (Infrastructure Engineer), Aziz Lamnouar (Project
Assistant) and Seni Ogunsanya (Financial Analyst) visited Kano State from 14 to 18 October
1998 jointly with Engr. Lawal Audi, Deputy Director, Federal CoordinaLting Unit (FEDCU).
Engr. Clement Anthonio representative of the Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund (PTF) and his.
assistants also attended the meetings and site visits. The main purpose of the mission were: (a)
to review the completion of all rehabilitation contracts; (b) prepare the irnplementation
completion reports (Borrower and Bank's own portion); (c) finalize all accounts including the
credit account, special account and project account; and (d) visit rehabilitation and maintenance
sites.
2.    The mission held discussions with  Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, Honorable
Commissioner for Works, Transport and Housing, Alhaji Mohammed Kabir, Permanent
Secretary and Engr. Mansur Ahmed, Project Coordinator of the State Ministry of Works,
Housing and Transport, the State Technical Assistant Consultants (STAG), and contractors and
consultants on site.
3.    The mission would like to congratulate the officials of the Kano State Ministry of Works
and Transport, in particular the Hon. Commissioner Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and Engr.
Mansur Ahmed, Project Coordinator for the successful implementation of this project. This in
particular, in view of the difficult political and economic situation the country has been facing
during the last five years.
11. General
4.    During this mission, it was noted that nearly all rehabilitation works have been
completed, with the exception of the Karaye-Rogo road works where a final section of 5
kilometers is still being worked on, but completion is expected by the end of October 1998.
5.    Within the Project Unit of the Civil Engineering Department in the Ministry, substantial
capacity has been built. A core staff of Engineers have been trained in using modem road
management tools, management information systems, financial management systems, and road
maintenance management systems. A ten year maintenance and rehabilitation program on the
State roads has been prepared and is ready for implementation. The Ministry promised to keep
the Project Unit intact and will endeavor to ensure a steady stream of financing.
6.    However, as has been observed early in the implementation of road sector projects in
Nigeria, the current set-up for the management and financing of roads in Nigeria in general and
in Kano State in particular is not suitable for sustained maintenance of the network. Therefore,
parts of the credit, originally meant for the preparation of new multi-state road projects have
been diverted to support the Road Vision 2000 Initiative (RV2000) which aims at a broad based



2
reform of road management and finance in Nigeria. It is hoped that RV2000 could commence
implementation early in 1999.  In that case RV2000 could definitely draw from experience
gained in Kano State from road maintenance execution by contract, and it would also likely
provide a sustainable framework for the utilization of the capacity built up at the Ministry.
HI. Project Funding and Accounts
7.    Project Account and Counterpart Funding: The mission noted that at-source deduction
of Naira 9 million per month has not been paid into the project account since January 1998. The
mission was however assured by the Ministry that it received confirmation from the Federal
Ministry of Finance (FMF) that a balance of counterpart funds of Naira 61 million will be paid
to the Ministry in four equal installments. If the Ministry receives the balance of Naira 61.
million,, the total counterpart fund provided by the State Government will be Naira 299 million.
In addition, the Petrol (Special) Trust Fund (PTF) has contributed Naira 224 million as
counterpart funds.
8.    Special and Credit Account: The balance of the special account is US$ 3334.42. The
Ministry has requested that the balance of the special account should be returned to the Bank's
account in Washington. With all withdrawal applications for eligible expenditures sent to
Washington, the total amount spent from the credit account will be US$ 36,357,377 leaving a
balance of US$ 630,622 (see Annex I). This balance will be canceled after all withdrawal
applications for eligible expenditures received before October 31, 1998 have been paid.
9.    Audit: The draft audit report as per September 30, 1998 is yet to be concluded and will
be forwarded to the Bank not later than November 15, 1998 . Or conclusion of all payments
after September 30 to October 31, 1998 from the credit and project accounts the audit report
will be finalized and sent to the Bank not later than by December 3 1, 1998.
IV. Rehabilitation Program
10.   The mission noted that at the end of the project, 413 km of roads have been rehabilitated
which represents about 60% of the State network. Through these improvements vehicle
operating costs (VOC) on State roads have reduced by 48% and the average economic rate-of
return (ERR) on the rehabilitated sections is 33%, as compared to 48% estimated during
appraisal. The average cost per km of the rehabilitation program is about US$ 90, 000 (see
Annex II). These low costs were achieved due to the adherence by the Ministry to the Bank's
procurement procedures. The mission expressed satisfaction with the completion and quality of
the works performed by the contractors, consultants and the Ministry's staff.
V. Maintenance Program
11.   Four term  maintenance contracts covering the entire state road network of 870
kilometers in four zones were signed on December 12, 1997 and were completed in August
1998 for a total amount of Naira 85,079,601.22. The experience with these term maintenance
contracts is very positive and it is suggested that this approach should be adopted under the
proposed RV2000 maintenance initiative.



12.   The Ministry, with the assistance of the STAC, has prepared a 10-year maintenance
program. The mission advised the Ministry to commence implementing the program as soon as
possible using the expected balance of counterpart fiunding of Naira 55 million as seed money,
while urgently identifying other sources, including continuation of the at-source deduction,
budget allocation, and the establishment of State based Road Fund.
VTL Other
13.   Implementation Completion Report (ICR): The draft copy of the Bank's own portion of
the implementation completion report (ICR) was given to the Ministry for its comments. The
mission received the draft ICR of the borrower's own portion.  It was agreed that the
Ministry's portion.would be finalized and sent to Washington not later than by November 15,'
1998.
14.   Progress Report: The mission received a status report as per October 15, 1998 and the
final progress report no 19 as per September 30, 1998.

Dear Sir,
Nigeria - First Multi-State Roads Project (CR. 2415-UN7)
Thank you for the cooperation extended to the recent World EBank mission that
visited your State from October 14 to 18, 1998, led by Mr. Dieter Schelling.
I also would like to congratulate you and the Honourable Commissioner of the
State Ministry of Works and Transport and his staff for the successful implementation of
this project, particularly in view of the difficult political and economic circumstances
which Nigeria has faced during the project implementation period.
I trust by now you have had a chance to circulate and review tJhe Aide-Memoire
dated October 26, 1998, prepared and left behind by the mission. Bank management has
reviewed the Aide-Memoire and endorses the recommendations and agreements
contained there-in.
In order to sustain the achievements made under the project., it is of utmost
importance that the State Government assures the allocation of sufficient resources for the
maintenance of the State road network.  As per the ten-year rehabilitation and
maintenance program prepared by the Project Unit, the recommended allocation for 1999
would be Naira 346 million. This amount would include additional resources required
for the finalization of the Challawa - Yako road, and would allow the rehabilitation of at
least part of the priority three roads which could not be rehabilitated under the project.
Sincerely yours,
*-'~-----    Yaw A nsu

of the total state road network. The rehabilitation included upgrading either to asphaltic
concrete roads or to double surface dressing; and the improvement included the
implementation of backlog / recurrent maintenance activities to improve the general
condition of the roads.
With the implementation of these measures the riding quality of the roads have improved
substantially, and the vehicle operation cost lowered by approximately 48%, with the
average rate of return on investment valued at 33%.
The project implementation was based on the Road Management Information System
which was developed at the early stages of the project. The design and supervision were
carried out by a number of consultants, appointed on the project after a rigorous
selection procedure.
Throughout the project, and with the assistance of STAC, a number of manuals
procedures and reports were developed in order to make the project implementation
more durable, competitive, and cost effective; and to, as well, ensure the continual and
effective future application of the developed system.
The training was a major activity in the project to ensure adequate transfer of technology
to Ministry's personnel. This was achieved through external and internal courses and
seminars, and through "on job training" of the counterparts.
E-   Major Alterations, Problems and delays
The most important problem which was encountered during the implementation of the
project was the shortage in the availability of petroleum products. This was overcome
through the use of outside marketer, but at a substantially higher cost.
The institutional strengthening, in regards to organisational restructuring and the
establishment of an independent road authority, could not be fully implemented.
However, the core unit for any future "effective and efficient road maintenance
applications"' has been made available through the intensive training of the Ministry's
Counterparts.
F-    10 - Year Maintenance plan and Budgeting
To conclude this project a maintenance plan and budgeting over 10 years period (1999 -
2008) was developedfor the Kano State Road Network.

1.1   Project scope and objectives
In 1992 the Kano State Miniistrpf Works,HJousing & Transport (SMIOWT), through
a subsidiary loan agreement with thie Federal Governmenit of Nigeria (FGN), obtai-led
a credit (No.2415-UNI) fromi the In[ernalional Dcvclopinmt Association (World
lianlk) for the financinig of the First Multi-State Roads Pi oJect (MSRP-l).
Tlhc principal objective of theI liroject was Llhc devCeopInic1t ol a sustainable tOadS
improvement programme by:
3    Strengthening the Ministry's roads organisationi.
*    Formulating programmies for road imainteniance, rehabilitation  and
upgrading.
The main comiponents of the Project included:
*    The rehabilitation and clearing the backlog mainitenanice of a number of
high priority roads, through the use of (qualified contractors appointed
under the competitive bidding rules.
*    The developmenit and implenmentation of a programmnne for the routine /
recurrent and emergency maintenianice of all State Roads, willt an
emphasis on the use of" private contractors appointed under conmpetitive
biddingi rules.
*    Thlle introduction of laboti --based andl liglht equilmniet-assisted technology
where appropriate.
o    The establishment of a roads organisation and procedures for the
planninjg, design and implementation of road mnaintenance woorks.
•    The training of Ministly personnel anci local contractors, and the
establishment of a  ITeohnolo-y  Transfer Centre (TTC) for fhe
dissemination of inforimation.



1.2    Project Environment and Colntext
The Project has been undertakeni by the Katio SMOW[I with the support of the State
Technical Assistance Consultants (STAC), Da.r Al-Handasah Consultants.
The Kano SMOWT is responsible for the maintenance of all inter-urban State roads,
which total approximately 870 km in length (Table 1.1). Of these, about 660 km had
asphaltio conicrete or surface-dressed pavenients, while thie remainder were eithel-
gravel or earth roads. Reference is made to attached map.
IThe majority of the roads were in a vety bad conditioni bellore the start of tlle project,
making them  either not trafficable, or operating at a veiy highi vehicular cost. '[he
illustratiofis anncxed to this repor-t show the condition of the various roads before anid
after the irnplementation of the imrprovemient measures.
The Chief Executive of the Kano SMOWr is the H-lonourable Comnmissioier, who lIHs
tnder his authority the various depat trents which form  the Ministry. Wlithliln  iC
SMOWT, the Civil Engineerinig Departimienit contains facilities for all works relatecd to
road construction and maintenance. A special section has also been established for co-
ordinating the activities related to the Multi-State Rtoads Project. The total smaff
complement of the Civil Engineering Department currently comprises approximately
450 personnel of all grades and disciplines.

3.0    PIROJECTI' EXECU'I'ION ANI) ACIIEIIVEMICI'NTS
T his section includes an analysis of the work ui(deilakcn on die MSRP -I Plroject
during its implemiientation; covering thie major activities across all categories ot work.
3.1    Civil Works
During the course of this project, a shift was intendedl to depart from the lobce
account method for carrying out maintenance or rehabilitation work, and toxvards
contracting out. The objective was to optimise productivity and promote efficiency andl
competitiveness in the implementation of the work. Simlilarly, the intention  was to
encourage and promote labour based teclnology for the implenmentation of routine
maintenance work.
With the above objeetives in mind, a detailed programme for rehabilitation / backlog
and normal maintenance work was establislhed at the start of thie project. This
programme was based on detailed inventory and condition survey of all state roads in
Kano State. The survey idenfV--,Zd the need of each road and defined the improvement
measures required to bring these roads to a maintainable standard. T his was carried otit
with tIhe use of a specially developed soflware anld database syste.n. Tlhe ro.ads and the
recommended ineasures were, theni, prioritised in accordance witlih their ecoInioic and
enviroiinmenltal importance; enidillng  LI) willh  a detailed  backlog / rehabilitation
programme.
3.1.1         Road Rehabilitatien
Three sets of priority roads were established; with a total of eleven (11) rehabilitationl
contracts  were  awarded  to  prequalified  contractors  under the  International
Competitive Bidding Rules. The contracts were all satisfactorily conmpleted during the
course of this project. The total lengthl of roads whichi were rehabilitated  was 4 6
Km, in addition to another 26 Km of roads which wlhere the subject of major r'.onliir
works.
Althoughl, the results of tlhe economic analysis and the World Bank's "Staff Appraisal
Report", favoured the application of Surface dressing on the majority of ilte roads;
however-, during the course of thie project, and in agreemlent witIi the World l3ank
visitinig miissioni, it was decided to apply  50 nini asphaltic concrtCe CN iOllIOt ol t(he
roads undergoing rehabilitation, witlh the exception of those witi less tllan 500 VPlD
(Vehicle Pler Day) for wlhichl dlouble layer of surface dr-essing would be applied Tliis
decision was based on the fact that asplialtic concrete roads are, genelally, mlore
durable and require less maintenance;, this is coupled withi tlie realistic possibility that
effective  mlaintenance on the roads was unlikely to takeplace until an eflicient and
effective road board is installed witlh special responsibility for monitorinig and
maintaininlg the r oad standard.
Tables 3.1 and 3.2 summarize the new structural char-acteristic and  the econonmic
benefit for each rehabilitated  road in terms of "Rouglhness", "Pavement Structural
Number" ,"Vehicle Operating Cost" and "Internal Rate of Returni. Thlese are, in turn,
compared with:
6



the corresponding values and benefits expected and listed in the l!rWorld
flank "Staff Appraisal Report, 1992, and
L.he original values obtained otn the road before the start of any
improvernent 'V-ork.
3.1.2         Road Mlaiintemlmnce
Based  on the backlog  / rehabilitation  programme, a five- year maintenance
programming and budgeting plan was also established. Tllis plan identified, for each
year, those roads whlichi wouldi be undergoinig mnajor upgrading or rehabilitation works,
those roads wviiich wouldk be "imaintainable" (itheir standard is fair or good), anid those
roads wlhichl would rbe classitieid as "not maintainable" (their standard is noor, and
ecotnomiiically  not viable  to  imiaintain  uintill major improvement measures  are
implemented). Based on this, tlle plan indicated the budget re(lLlirement for all
maintenance activities and for all state roads over live years period, (1 996 - 2)000)
In view of this maintenance plan, four Term Maintenance Contracts were prepared
and awarded to qualified competitive contractors. Each contract covered a zone in
Kano State and included a commitment by the contractor to undertake all mainteinance
E eiLuirements within that zone for a period of one year; in accordance with specific and
periodic instructions that could be issued by the Client to remedy certain defects on the
roads. Such instructions wouild be based on the detailed  schedule of activities and
agreed unit r ates, as stipulated in the contract.
Successfuilly, a number of roads benefited from this system; whereby poth-ioles were
patched, edge repairs were carried out, grave! rooads were made tramficable, and wvash-
out were repaired.
Additionally, a pilot scheme for routine maintetnanice using labolur basedl technology
was carried out on one road. T'lhe mletlo(dology, repiorts and training  utsed for thie
implementation ot' thiis pilot sclheme  were all documilented for fIlture use by the
Nhlilistry.
3.2    Design and Supervision Consultants
All the roads whiclh have been rehabilitated under this project were desioned and
supervised by qualified independetnt local consultants. Thiese codisultants wer-e selected
from  a short list of well kniown and reputable firms. The selection process was
exhaustive and in accordance with predeter-miiined set of criteria and thresholds of
wlhich the prospective consultants have to satisfy. Those firrms scoring higlher points in
,he selection process were invited to enter into agreement for the consultanlcy ,ervices.
In total eight (8) consu.ltanicy contracts were awvarded to eight difTMreiit firms. Initially
ticv prepared the  design for the selected priority roads (486.7 Kim), and th!ereafter
snt-,evise th.eir constriuction (t103 Kiii). lThe remaining roads (84 Kni) were designed

3.3   Institutional Strengtheiiiig
A comprehensive review of the existinig institutional structure was carried out at tie
start of project. 'I'he purpose of such review was to conesi(ler the likely sliot and long
term  future requirements, and evaluate any chaintiges or Stt cthcniWliicih Could tbe
required to enh1anice the efliciency anid productivity of' the road nmanagemnenit, and to
sustain an effective and maintainable road network.
The review concluded with a set of recommendations detailed in a special report
(Institutional Development Report No. 1). These reconimendations called for the
implementation of certain procedures in the undertaking of road maintenance /
rehabilitation works, and the need to closely review the maintenance organisation at
the zonal and local division levels.
Below is a summary of the various procedures and  systems that were developed

4.0  MIAJOR ALTERATION TO ORIGINAL SCOPE OF WORK
The project proceeded in accor-dance with the scope of work and objectives set out in
the loan agreement and Staff Appraisal Report.
However, the scope of institutional streiL,thienling was limited  to  the training(i ol
Ministry's pC[SOnnlCI at various Ievels witli particular emlpllasis onl the eounnterparlts,
and those at the managerial level directly involved in the project implementation. 'The
original concept of critically assessing and strengthening the or-ganisational structure of
the various interrelated depaltments in the Ministry and( at the local zonal levels, cOuid
not be materialisecl, and the establislhmiient of a road maintenianice authority with special
road fuind could not be completed by the end of the project, although the concept has
been agreed to, in principle.
Furthermore, the establishment of the Technology Transfer Centre (TTC) could not be
carried otut due the withdrawal of Jigawa State from the project, and rendering suLch
scheme un-economical to Kano State.
5.0  MAJOR PROBLEMS AND DELAYS
The rehabilitation projects startedl as scheduled, however their- completion   was
delayed due to a number of reasons, wlhich were beyond the control of either tlhe
conitractors or the Client. T'hese reasons could be grouped under one heading whiclh is
the shortage of bitumen and other petroleuI-ml plroducts. Thlis shortage las caLuseCd 111K
conitraclors to seek alternative sources of bitumIen and fuel;ICl, mioStly fromil OutSidC
miarketer- at muchl lhigher prices.
The increase in the price of bitumen has prompted the contractors to seek adjustnment
to the original contract value, wwhich was subsequently ,ranted after obtaining the nO
objecticn from the World Bank. The average increase in the contracts values (acro;,s
all contracts) amounted to approximately 12%.

6.0    CONCILUSION ANI) REWOMIME FN DATIONS
Ilhe Project has achieved miost of its targets and objectives in cifectively im ing IIC
standard of the State Road Network in Kano, and devising a cotnprehensive system Ior
sustaining the road in a mainitainable coIIditioI.
The institutional aspect of the project has been partially achieved through intensive
training programmes, but not through structural reorganisation. However, utilising all
the training, documentation and systems produced during the implemientatioll of the
project, it's anticipated that a more efficient road maintenance will be carried out.
Notwithistanding the above, the recommendation at this closing stage of the project is
for a special / qualified and trained road authority to be in place to overlook the road
rehabilitation and maintenance activities. Such authority is to be a cost centr-e with a
special lbund drawn from the continuation of the deduction at source system.
Furthermore, it's stroIigly IrecomiieiidedI that thle  Ini tena Iice progranmnc  al 1d
renmaizniig rehabilitation work, IS set oLut in thc next scCtioll of thlis report, to bc htilly
and timely impleniented.

7.0    TEN-YEAR MAIN'T'ENANCE PROGRANIME AN) lUlJDGETING
(1999- 2008)
As the MSIVIS-l Project is closing, a detailed "two folds" programme has bect
prepared indicating:
A-    the remaining items of work (backlog anid relhabilitationi) whiclh ar-e still
outstanding on the road network, Table 7. 1; and
B-    the annual maintenanice plan and budgeting for routine / recurrent /
periodic maintenance works over I years period, (1999 - 2008),
Tables 7.2-7.1 1
This programme and budgeting is primliarily based on the original similar programminec
developed for the state road netwoi-k early on in the project (October 1995), which
was part of thc feasibility stucly foi- the rehabilitation of the 3rd set of priority roa(is.
Ilowever, it's wolrtlh notinig that soine iiodilcalionis to the "older of lpriorities" h1as
taken place in this niew program-me; reflecting the currenit coniditioins on1 the roads and
their current importance in the local and global context.
The outstanding rehabilitation / backlog maintenance works rellect the reiiiainine,
requirements of the 3rd set of priority roads that could not be implenmenited within the
MSRP project due to budget and tirme constraints. The work is prioritised andc spread
over a number of years subject to budget availability. If sufficient fund could be ma3de
available over shorter,period, r' .time span for the impllementation of the remahi,iii
road improvernent works could be made shorter.
TIhe type of rehabilitation and the optimum time for implementing the optimal strategy
is indicated in the programme, based on the economic priority and justifications
The  annual mainitenanice  plan  and  budgeting  indicates the  yearly nmonetary
requiremnents for routine / recurrent andl periodic mainitenianice works as well as lor a- )ny
rehabilitation or backlog works. This is based oni the curr-ent cotndition ratinig of the
road network, and on the new programmine ior outstanding rehabilitationi / backlog(
nmaintenance works as described al)ove.
Those roads that have been rehabilitated under the MSRI' project, achieving the
"good" condition rating, will be requi-ed to undergo yearly routine and recurrent
maintenance activities. Those roads that have been subjected to small repair and
maintenance works during the project, achieving "fair" condition rating, will continue
to undergo similar routine and recurrent miaintenance with occasional intervention for
upgrading or overlay as and when the programme calls for that. Those roads that were
originally included in the 3rd set of priority roads for rehabilitation, but could not be
implemented due to budget and time constraints, will undergo major repair works in
accordance with the new programme, in order to improve their condition rating. T hose
roads that have been classified as non-maintainable and economically not justified to
incur expenditure oni them, will not be the subject of any major mainitenanice work with
exception of minor routine maintenance on those roads which are paved.
