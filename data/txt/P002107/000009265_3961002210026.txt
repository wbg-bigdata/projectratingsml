MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR THE FIRST MULTISTATE ROADS PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Federal Republic of Nigeria (FGN) for SDR 49.8 million,
the equivalent of US$68 millior, to help finance the First Multistate Roads Project (MSRP).
The credit would be on standari IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years. The Government
would onlend: US$30 million equivalent to Jigawa and US$36 million equivalent to Kano at
IBRD's standard variable interest, including five years of grace. The states would bear the
foreign exchange risk. In addition, US$2.0 million equivalent would be passed on to the
Federal Ministry of Works ana Housing (FMWH) to finance technical assistance.
2.    Ickgrund. Over the last 15 years a remarkable expansion and improvement has
occurred in the Nigerian roads system. However, inadequate maintenance now threatens the
road network, raising the possibility of the loss of past investments and serious repercussions
for the economic well-being cf the country. Road maintenance capability is weak at all levels
of Government, and this problem is compounded by weak organizational structures for
managing the road system. T he Bank is supporting a shift in emphasis to maintenance from
new construction. In line wih this policy shift, the Government of Nigeria has requested the
Bank's assistance to improve the road networks in selected states. The proposed project,
which would be the Bank's first operation for state roads, would provide the opportunity to
pursue at the state level the types of improvements being introduced at the federal level to
strengthen the management of road administration. Originally six states, Anambra, Kaduna,
Kano, Lagos, Niger and Oyo were selected ey the FGN for inclusion in the proposed MSRP,
based on their capacity to mreet the local costs of road programs and their willingness to
reorient roads expenditure from expansion to maintenance, upgrading, and strengthening.
The number of states was later reduced !o two viz., Kano and Jigawa at the request of the
Government.
3.    EQiect Objcives. The main objective of the proposed project is to support a
sustainable improvement program for high priority roads in the states of Jigawa and Kano
by: (a) creating a capacity for planning and management of the state roads system, including
strengthening of the State Ministries of Works and Transport (SMOWTs); and (b) developing
a road upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance program and increasing the use of private
contractors. In parallel with the roads rehabilitation program, the project will support a
comprehensive institutional development program that will strengthen the capacity of SMOWT
staff in the three states to plan and oversee works carried out by private contractors through
on-the-job and formal training. The project will also establish Technology Transfer Centers
at the state level.



- 2 -
4.    Project Description. The proposed project would support the following main
components in the states of Jigawa and Kano to be executed by contract for:
(a)    Civil Works.
(i)    Road maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening. An economically
justified program to reduce the backlog of rehabilitation and
strengthening works on about 830 km of priority state roads;
xii)   Roads upgrading. Paving of about 220 km of selected high priority,
heavily trafficked unsurfaced roads to appropriate design standards;
(b)    Vehicles and equipment. Procurement of vehicles and equipment as au aid for
better management of roads; and
(c)   Instituional development. Developmert of staff capabilities for planning,
design and supervision of construction and maintenance of state roads; staff
would be assisted to put this into practice by moving towards greater use of
contractors and away from force account operations.
5.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$91.8 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$68.0 million (74%). A breakdown of costs and financing are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and the methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group Operations in Nigeria are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10282-UNI dated
May 5, 1992 is also attached.
6.    Proiect lmplementation. The SMOWT's of Jigawa and Kano would implement the
programs with oversight provided by the FMWH. Both the FMWH and the project SMOWT
in each state will be assisted by consultants who would also be responsible for contract
administration and construction supervision. Consultants subject to Bank approval would also
be employed to provide technical assistance and training. Local financing will be provided by
each state through allocations from its Federation Account (less than 4% of each state's
monthly allocation) with the FGN, and increases in road user charges. IDA financing will be
provided through the FGN which will onlend the funds to the states. Most of the IDA
financed road contracts will he procured by International Competitive Bidding.
7.    Project Sustainability. The project is designed to enhance the capacity of state
authorities to plan and implement routine and periodic maintenance of state roads and to
ensure sustainability by: (a) substituting force account operations with maintenance contracts
with small to medium-scale domestic contractors; and (b) improving availability of funds
through reforms in resource mobilization, cost recovery and budgetary allocation. A key
aspect is that each participating state must prepare an action plan and to increase road user
charges under their jurisdiction to enable them to meet at least the cost of recurrent
maintenance.
8.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The World Bank Group
involved in Nigeria's transport sector has consisted of one railway project, two port projects



-3 -
and seven highway projects. The Transport Parastatals Project (June 1986) has supported the
government's efforts to improve the performance of parastatals, especially in railways and
ports. Two types of problems predominated in past lending operations in the transport sector,
and measures have been taken in the design of the proposed MSRP to avoid their recurrence.
The first problem was the lack of success of institutional development components compared
to the relative success of physical investment. The MSRP would build up the SMOWTs by
first of all relieving them from the management of force account operations and strengthening
their capacity to plan, design and supervise the works to be carried out by contract. By
focussing on priority areas, this approach would maximize the use of the limited manpower
available in the SMOWTs at the technical and managerial levels. Most road maintenance
works would be transferred to private contractors which could operate more efficiently with
less bureaucratic constraints. Second, past road projects suffered substantial delays in
reaching agreement on bidding documents and other procurement related matters due partly to
a lack of familiarity with Bank requirements stemming from the lack of staff continuity, and
poor training and communication. During the preparation of the proposed project, special
efforts have been taken to familiarize staff at the FMWH and the SMOWTs with Bank
rcquirements for standard bidding documents, which the FMWH has now adapted fcr its own
use.
9.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The project would be part of an ongoing effort to
upgrade Nigeria's road system, to make more effective use of existing infrastructure, and to
identify cost recovery mechanisms for roads. As works and transportation normally account
for a significant percentage of public expenditure at the state and local levels, an IDA
financed state roads project could be an effective vehicle for institutional and fiscal reform.
The Bank has been a catalyst in Nigeria at the federal level in achieving more economic road
investment programs, stressing rehabilitation and maintenance over new investment, and
emphasizing institutional development and cost recovery. The Bank is now in a strong
position to extend these benefits to the state level. The Bank has also intensified its dialogue
with Government on the need to shift road maintenance activities from force account
operations to greater use of contractors. The project provides a good vehicle to strengthen the
SMOWTs in contract supervision, while encouraging greater involvement of the private road
contracting industry.
10.   Ageed Actins. Each participating state has confirmed that steps have been taken to
have their local counterpart funds deducted from the Federation Acc'runt and deposited into a
Project Account. These amounts are expected to be less than 4% of each state's monthly
allocation from the Federation Account. During negations, agreement was reached with the
Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the States of Jigawa and Kano on the
following matters: (i) all civil works will be executed by contract; (ii) the list of priority roads
to be included in the Project; (iii) the details for carrying out a manpower development
program; (iv) confirmation of the project cost estimates; (v) no expenditures on roads outside
the project will be undertaken by the states in excess of US$5 million in either state without
consultation with the Bank; (vi) consultants acceptable to the Bank will be appointed by the
FMWH and the individual states; (vii) a mid-term project review will be carried out not later
than December 1995 to evaluate and assess overall progress made in project implementation;
(viii) annual reviews will be held in the last quarter of each implementation year to review the
work program and budgetary allocations for the following year; (ox) steps to be taken to
mitigate may adverse environmental impacts of the proposed project; (x) proposals for
conducting and implementing roads specific ElAs; (xi) adequate annual budgetary allocation



-4 -
for recurrent maintenance of state roads; (xii) reporting requirements and key indicators for
monitoring progress; (xiii) timely submission of audited financial reports; and (xiv) contitded
recovery from road users of the costs of state road recurrent maintenance. Confirmation has
been obtained that: (a) the mechanism for transfer of local counterpart funds from the
Federation Account to the project account of each state is in place; and (b) the participating
states have prepared a plan of action to implement a system to recover from road users at
least recurrent maintenance costs. The following actions would be taken prior to credit
effectiveness: (1) forwarding training plans to the Bank for its review and agreement; (2)
signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the FGN and at least one of the participating
states; (3) the commitment by at least one state to incorporate in its 1993 budget proposals an
increase in road user charges required to recover the costs of recurrent maintenance; (4)
appointment of consultants by the participating states, on terms and conditions agreeable to
the Bank; (5) opening by each participating state of a Project Account with an initial deposit
of at least N2 million in a commercial bank; and (6) the employment of an environmental
specialist to assist FMWH in the establishment of an Environmental Assessment and
Monitoring Unit. Conditions of disbursement in any one of the project states would be: (a)
signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between the state and FGN, for the state which had not
signed such an agreement by the time of credit effectiveness; (b) commitment to incorporate
in its 1993 budget proposals an increase in road user charges required to recover the costs of
recurrent maintenance for the state which had not implemented such a plan by the time of
credit effectiveness; and (c) evidence of allocation of the agreed level of financing of
maintenance operations in the 1993 state budget, i.e. at least N8.0 million for Jigawa and
W9.5 million for Kano state.
11.   Environmental Aspects. An environmental assessment has been completed for the
proposed MSRP. It found that road construction projects often have adverse impacts on local
environments. These impacts may include erosion due to improper design of embanknments or
side drains; scouring of the landscape due to the opening of borrow pits; and destruction of
vegetation due to the clearing of right of ways. In the case of road rehabilitation and
reconstruction works, the environmental impact tends to be more local and limited, and result
more from reconstruction activities or improper design.
12.   The final responsibility tor the implementation of road specific Environmental Impact
Assessments (ElAs) lies with each participating state. As neither the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency (FEPA) nor the SMOWTs have sufficient in-house capabilities at present to
conduct ElAs, the assessments will be done by consultants working under terms of reference
provided by FMWH and agreed with FEPA and the Bank. The mitigation plans are to be
agreed with the Bank. The consultants would be hired by each participating state under the
framework of the project.
13.   Program Objective Categories. The main thrust of the project is in removing critical
bottlenecks in the basic state roads infrastructure thereby reducing transport costs and
improving the links between federal and rural roads networks. The relationship with the
country's anti-poverty strategy is indirect, in that savings in costs will eventually be passed on
to the rural farmers in the form of higher prices for agricultural produce. The project will
also directly contribute to private sector development through use of domestic contractors for
maintenance and rehabilitation works.



14.   Project Benefits. The main benefit from the project would be a more efficient and
cost effective state roads network that would permit a higher level of economic activity.
Quantifiable benefits consist of savings in vehicle operating costs for normal traffic, plus
diverted or generated traffic where applicable, which will result from improved conditions of
the state road network. On this basis. the overall ERR of the project is estimated as 37%.
Improvement and construction works will be subjected to detailed design and further
economic analysis before implemertation. No road project will be financed unless the ERR
is 12% or higher. The benefits of the institutional development components, including
establishment of road maintenance extension services, are potentially high though
unquantifiable.
iS.   Ri;ks There are three major risks associated with the project. The first concerns the
ability of new and untried state executing agencies to effectively manage both a large increase
in maintenance operations and the switch to contract works. The second risk concerns state
level capacity to maintain an acceptable contracting process. The third risk involves the
provision of counterpart funds which have historically been a major problem in project
implementation in all sectors. The first two risks will be addressed through the consultants
and Bank supervision. The third risk will be addressed by having counterpart funds deducted
at the source, and the commitment of the participating states to do so will be a condition of
negotiations. A condition of disbursement is that each of the participating states will have
opened a Project Account with an initial deposit of at least 2 million naira.
16.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
