3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
The Project included two major components: (a) the Air Pollution Abatement Program (APAP)
Component; and (b) the Geographical Information System (GIS) Component.
a. APAP Component: The objective of the Air Pollution Abatement Program was to reduce
ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM,) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) along with the health
damage associated with exposure to air pollution. The Project was designed to achieve this
objective by providing loans to households and boilerhouse owners to convert to cleaner heat
sources from polluting fuels. A Revolving Fund has been set up to stretch the availability of
funding for the APAP component over a longer period of time.
b. GIS Component: The objective of the Geographical Information System Component (GIS)
was to collect, organize, and manage information for improved development, land-use planning,
and environmental management, particularly in the areas that are experiencing rapid development.
It also motivates municipalities to build local GIS centers as a part of the national GIS
infrastructure.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The original, broad objectives of the Project were not revised, neither for the APAP Component,
nor for the GIS Component.
APAP Component: The initial objective, namely to concentrate the conversions from polluting
fuels to clean energy sources in areas with the most severe air pollution, was broadened in 1997:
The relaxation of the target area limitations has allowed to retain support of the Program as a
national environmental effort, and to respond to those who wished to promote the Program most
aggressively. This was consistent with the original objective of creating a self-sustaining loan
fund for extension throughout polluted areas of Slovenia. But, as demand for funds under the
APAP component has declined, the Project scope has also been widened in 1998 to accept new
installations of heating systems using clean energy sources. Starting in September 2000, after the
exhaustion of the World Bank loan, funds available under the Revolving Fund were also being
used. Upon the request of the Slovenian Government to meet EU standards, starting with the
campaign of May 2001, funds of the revolving fund are also eligible for meeting other
environmental objectives of the Ekofund, namely improving water quality and reducing water
pollution emanating from households and small enterprises.

Under the GIS Component, the objectives were re-clarified after an unsatisfactory technical
assistance effort in the first year after loan effectiveness. Thus, in mid-1998 a contract with a new
consultant was concluded who helped establish the priority needs for geo-spatial data, assessed
the training needs for the country in using the data, and suggested the reorganization of the
components of the Project accordingly.
3.3 Original Components:
The APAP Component of the Project was based on a pilot phase of the Program in the City of
Maribor to establish the mechanism for administering many small loans to households and
boilerhouse owners, to help them convert to clean heat sources, and to observe the rate of
conversion when such loans were made available. This pilot phase, carried out under the
management of the Ekofund of Slovenia, was successfully completed by Project appraisal and
demonstrated a significant reduction of air pollution and notably PM, and SO2. The full APA
Program was to be a nation-wide Program, initially including 55 cities of Slovenia with the highest
air pollution levels, later adding another 18 municipalities, when other areas, with significant
pollution, albeit less severe, were added. Thus, sub-loans under the Project were being offered for
household and boilerhouse conversions in urban areas with unacceptable levels of air pollution.
The Program, for the period of mid-1996 to mid-2001, was estimated to cost DM 50 million
(US$ 27.3 million) and was the basis for the Environment Project. The costs were to be met by at
least 20% (DM 10 million [US$ 5.46 million]) from sources of sub-project owners, by DM 10
million (US$ 5.46 million) of sources from the Ekofund, and by DM 30 million (US$ 16.4 million)
from the World Bank loan.
Based on the lessons learnt from the pilot phase, the APAP was turned into a self-sustaining
Revolving Fund (similar to the successful Slovenia Housing Fund) that is financing similar
sub-projects throughout Slovenia.
The GIS Component of the Project was designed to provide hardware and software, technical
assistance, consultant services and training to help collect, organize, and manage information for
improved development, land-use planning and environmental management. The Component
consisted of the following Parts A to D:
Part A: Geographic Information System (GIS): Establishment of a central Geographic
Information System in Ljubljana to be administered by the Geographic Information Center (GIC)
of the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning (MoE) and expanding and upgrading the
existing GIS of the MoE.
Part B: Market Development Group: Establishment of a market development group by the GIC
to provide training in the use of the GIS and assistance to the personnel of regional
administrations, agencies and departments of the Slovenia and industrial, commercial and service
users.
Part C: Quality Control: Establishment of formal international standards and a quality assurance
group within the MoE to ensure that the GIS operates in accordance with said international
standards,
Part D: Local Training Center: Establishment of a local training center in co-operation with local
universities with an experienced international geometrics organization with the authority to grant
- 3 -



internationally recognized certifications in the GIS.
3.4 Revised Comnponents:
The APAP Component: Since 1997 the entire area of Slovenia has been covered by the APAP.
Since 1998, also new heating installations using clean energy sources were admitted for funding.
Since May 2001, the Revolving Fund is also being promoted to fight water pollution emanating
from households and small enterprises, mostly as a result of the Slovenian Government to meet
EU standards.
The GIS Component: The Project has developed standards for establishing data sets of basic
geometry, land cadastre and other necessary data sets. The Project has helped the existing
Geographical Information Center (GIC) of the MoE to start functioning as a meta database server
and has helped to standardize procedures of delivering information and data to users. The Project
has established procedures of use of these data in the field of land use planning and environment
protection. The information organized and managed by the GIC is used, inter alia, to:
1. support, monitor and enforce the "Environmental Protection Act" passed in June
1994, and the associated environmental impact regulatory policies and procedures;
2. support the current and the pending "Spatial Planning and Construction Building Act"
and the associated environmental/construction policies and procedures;
3. facilitate domestic and international investments in Slovenia by making the spatial
planning and development approval processes more efficient, transparent, and less
arbitrary;
4. increase reliability, acceptance and creditability of land cadastres.
During the last three years, the efforts of the borrower have been concentrated on the ONIX
project, the objective of which, within the framework of the GIS Component, has been to create
conditions which will provide for an accelerated development and establishment of standardized
digital data bases as the foundation for providing information support to the efforts of protecting
the environment, to real estate management and spatial planning. The real estate data-base is also
used for a more transparent and equitable real estate tax administration.
The GIS Component is complete and has remained within its original budget of DM 5.4 million
(US$ 2.95 million), of which the Bank loan helped finance DM 4.6 million (US$ 2.5 million).
There are efforts to integrate the GIS Component with the more recent Land Cadastre Project
initiated by the Bank (SI-PE-55 304).
3.5 Quality at Entrv:
There was no QAG Review of the Project at entry.
APAP Component: The early supervision reports point to faster than expected disbursement, due
to the success of the Program and its good design, scope and management of implementation. The
pilot phase in Maribor had been highly successful and led to design modifications which further
accelerated the overall APAProgram performance. This speaks for a very positive judgement of
the Project at entry.
-4 -



GIS component: This Project Component was fortunate to have a high level of initial
"preparedness" (availability of quality personnel, inforrnation technology, established source
databases, etc.). The human, technical, and experiential resources that were required to
successfully complete the Project Component were readily available in Slovenia.
The Project Component also retained Foreign Advisory Services for the duration of the Project.
The ITC (Netherlands) was retained for approximately a year at which time the contract was
transferred to Buchner & Associates Ltd. (Canada).
The new consultant helped clarify the detailed scope of work under the Component's objective,
which was precisely the work which the foreign consultant was to have started with. The
combination of the qualified and experienced Foreign Manager/Advisors, the University of
Maribor, and the Project Implementation Team (PIT) worked very well as evidenced by the
success of the Project and quality of the outputs. Thus, ex post, a ranking of HS at entry has been
considered appropriate.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achieventent ofobjectiv e:
The overall achievement of the Project's objectives are judged to be Highly Satisfactory (HS).
The Project has substantially met the original objectives of the Project namely, for the:
APAP Component: to reduce air-pollution in cities resulting from small stack emissions
(households and small boiler operators converting from dirty fuels to cleaner energy use);
GIS Component: to achieve an efficient and transparent data collection, organization and
management under a new geographical information system, which is contributing to improved
environmental protection, spatial planning and reliability, credibility and acceptance of land
cadastres, and of real estate transactions.
4.2 OutpIuts by conmponents:
APAP Component (estimated cost DM SO million [US$ 27.3 million]); World Bank financing
DM 30 million [US$ 16.4 million]: The Project was based on a pilot effort in the City of
Maribor to test the viability of a credit line for air pollution abatement from the Ekofund, which
was executed during 1995 and early 1996. This pilot operation helped finance conversion of 5
boiler houses and almost 200 household heating facilities from dirty fuel to clean energy sources,
such as gas, LPG, gas-oil, heat pumps, district heating, and solar installations at a total cost of
about DM 1.66 million (US$ 0.9 million). As this pilot effort was judged successful during Project
appraisal, in helping to reduce air pollution in Maribor. The Project, through a sound credit line
design, scope and administration, including public relations for the effort, helped expand this
effort, initially covering the most polluted areas of Slovenia. With success continuing, the scope of
the Project was expanded in 1997 to cover the entire country with the same objective of reducing
air pollution from small stack emission.
Including the pilot phase and extending the time frame to the end of year 2000, a total of almost
4950 sub-projects were executed with a total Project cost of DM 53.95 million (US$ 29.5
- 5 -



million), including a total loan amount of DM 41.77 million (US$ 22.8 million). In the following,
this chapter will concentrate on the total Program from the beginning of the pilot phase to end
2000. Number of subloans, approved, amounts of loans and total sub-project costs are shown,
year by year, in the table below.

B.Hs.Cv. = Boiler House Conversions
H.H.Cv. = Household Conversions of Heating/Hotwater Systems
The household heating and hot water facility conversions, representing about 82% of total Project
costs, comprised six types of conversions from brown-coal and/or wood firing to gas firing, to
LPG-firing, to gasoil firing, to district heat, to heat pumps and to solar heating. However, only
three of these, namely conversion to gas, to LPG, and to gasoil, accounted for 98 % of the total
household conversions funded (in terms of sub-project costs) with gas representing about 39%
and gasoil and LPG about 29% of total household conversion costs. District heat connections
only represented less than one percent of total household conversions' funding (89 conversion
projects), mostly because in the larger municipalities this tends to be fumded by the district heating
company. Moreover, DH companies have not pursued network expansions rather vigorously,
which otherwise would have added to demand for this heating system. The installation of heat
pumps only used up 0.3% of total household funding (12 conversion projects). This is not
surprising as the relative costs of operation of heat pumps are higher in Slovenia than those of
gas, LPG and gasoil fired installations. On the other hand, installation of solar heating represented
almost 1% of the total household conversions' funding (30 conversion projects). Obviously,
consumers were reluctant to go for the more innovative technologies which had not been proven
nor promoted sufficiently and have a relatively low return on investment as compared to the more
traditional sources.

After the pilot phase, limited to the Maribor region, the Project initially concentrated on 6
major regions with large municipalities and three smaller ones, as follows: Regions of
Maribor, of Celje, of Ljubljana, Dolenska Region (southeast of Ljubljana), Gorenska Region
(mountainous region northwest of Ljubljana), and Koroska Region, (mountainous region in the
north); as well as the regions of Zagorje (Sava valley), Trbolvje, and Hrastnik (summarized as
region of Zasavje). In 1997, the regions of Prekmuije (notheastem region) and Primorska (coastal
region, including the Soca valley) were added, therefore making the Project a nationwide effort of
air-pollution abatement. Counting the entire APAP Program, including the pilot phase at
Maribor, the Maribor region accounted for almost one third of all loans (by number 1583 out of
4943) and over 29% of total loan amounts allocated (DM 12.25 million [US$ 6.7 million] out of
DM 41.77 million [US$ 22.8 million] until end-2000). This was followed by the Ljubljana region
with over 15% of total loan amounts, and by Gorenska with almost 12%. The regions of
Primorska, Dolenska, Zasavje and Celje scored each between 8% and 11%, where as Prekmurje
only scored 4.2% and Koroska 1.3%. It is not surprising that Maribor scored best, as it was the
target of the pilot phase in 1995 already and the Maribor Bank, administering the loans, has its
head-quarters in Maribor. On the other extreme, Koroska has low population density, is mostly of
rural nature, and has mostly wood firing, little brown coal-firing in household heating systems,
whereas Primorska (coastal region) with similar characteristics (at least in winter), has come into
the Program only during 1997. It is also interesting to note the high percentage of boiler house
conversions in total loans in Zasavje (42%), where many housing blocks in medium sized cities
applied for conversion of coal fired boilers to gas firing. On the other extreme, rural Koroska
seems to have few housing blocks calling for conversion: the BH conversions only represented
5%.

The distribution of loans over the time of Project implementation was very uneven, with a very
vigorous start of the full Project in the second half of 1996, with an even more pronounced year
of 1997 which saw the full expansion of APAP to the entire country; and then a gradual decline in
number of conversions and loan amounts, averaging more or less than 50% of the levels achieved
in the preceding year until 2000. The reason for this early strong performance (1996 and 97) and
the subsequent decline was three-fold:
1. Between 1995 and 1997, the differential between the APAP rate of 5.5% to 6.7%, and the
commercially available lending rates of 18.2% to 24.7%, was substantial: between 13 and 18
- 7 -



percentage points. Whereas the APAP customer had to carry the foreign exchange risk, this
was considered small as compared to the large differential. This differential decreased,
however, in subsequent years significantly.  While still substantial (between 6 and 12
percentage points between 1998 and 2000), it had to be seen against the foreign exchange risk
with significant devaluation of the Tolar taking place over time (see table below). Moreover,
commercial banks started to see opportunities and pursued customers increasingly
aggressively.
2. The decreasing incentive of using the APAP Program must also be seen in the light of
administrative requirements under the APAP as compared to the informal requirements to
obtain a regular personal Tolar loan from a commercial bank (for any purpose). The added
paperwork for APAP is certainly not overwhelming, but does require an offer from a
reputable contractor, a permit to undertake the work and a number of administrative data
which would not be needed for a personal commercial loan.
3. The total number of conversions is finite in the country and an increasing number of
conversions took place over time, so that the remaining finite number declined significantly
during the period. Of course, APAP can only capture a portion of these. The remainder will
typically be covered by commercial loans as well as by outright owner financing.

APAP Component Effect on Air-Pollution: Abatement Results in the Regions: The effects of
the APAP Component in terms of environmental performance have been estimated. Two
parameters can be evaluated: (a) Reduction of emissions from households and boiler houses as a
result of implementation of conversion projects; and (b) Reduction of concentrations of
particulate matter and SO2 in ambient air. A short analysis follows:
(a)   Reduction of Emissions from Households and Boilerhouses: Practically all of the
sub-projects of conversion went from brown coal firing and/or wood firing to cleaner heat
sources. A review of a representative sample of projects provided information on the average of
coal and wood consumption per household and for a typical boiler house prior to conversion.
Accordingly, on average, each household conversion has eliminated about 4 tons of relatively low
quality brown coal and about 6 cubic meters of firewood. Each boilerhouse conversion has
eliminated an average of 150 tons of brown coal equivalent. Based on the total number of
sub-projects between 1995 and 2000, this represents a total elimination of about 29,550 tons of
brown coal and about 29,925 cubic meters of hard firewood per year, with boilerhouses
accounting for about one third of total coal elimination from the component, but only for about
- 8 -



2% of total wood elimination. The following table illustrates the net savings per year resulting (a)
from the permanent elimination of coal and wood in 4876 sub-projects, and (b) additional
emissions resulting from conversion to fuel oil firing in 1294 out of a total of 4876 sub-projects. It
is assumed that the new emissions of PMW and SO2 from gas or LPG firing are negligible. In the
case of solar heating this is the case anyway. In the case of conversion to district heat or heat
pumps, emissions for the marginal additional loads have also been assumed as negligible.

S02 Savings (tons per year)             889       60      (32)       917
(b)   Reduction of Concentrations of Particulate Matter and SO2 in Ambient Air: The
impact of the Project on these parameters is much more difficult to estimate. Ambient air is
influenced by every local polluting source, including large emitters, as for example large
powerplants or industrial facilities, small stack emissions from boiler houses and households,
emissions from mobile sources such as cars, trucks and busses, and even from transboundary
pollution. And this listing is by no means exhaustive. However, studies elsewhere have
demonstrated that ambient air quality in urban areas, with regard to the particularly
health-threatening particulate matter in combination with SO 2, is predominantly influenced by
small stack emissions. Large industrial and power plants in a well working environment have
typically well functioning air filters against PM,0 emissions, and high stacks for dispersion of SO2-
and remaining PMIO emissions. And exhausts from an individual mobile combustion engine of a
relatively modem design, are kept low by technological advances. Slovenia has mostly
modernized its vehicle fleets. The improvements resulting from replacement of the old small fleets
of the early 1990ies in Central European countries have, however, often been counterbalanced by
increased pollution from a rapidly growing fleet. Slovenia has been no exception in this regard.
A review of the ambient air quality measurements in the places where projects have been
concentrated, is revealing, and certainly provides a qualitative indicator, which corroborates the
beneficial impact of the APAP Component on ambient air quality with regard to particulate matter
and SO2. However, we must keep in mind, that other factors have influenced air quality as well. In
any case, the public relations campaigns (typically at least two per year) have contributed to raise
awareness about the issue of air pollution from household heating and have induced many
conversion projects, even if they were not funded by the Ekofund.
The tables below are based on statistics gathered with regard to PM,, and SO2 by the
meteorological institute of Slovenia. A few comments are in place:
(a) Unfortunately the institute did not have measuring points in all cities, where the APAP
Program was active. Thus only a few are matching exactly (Maribor, Celje, Ljubljana). Trbovlje
and Zagorje are in the Zasavje region. For the other geographical areas no ambient air quality
measures are available.
-9-



(b) The particulate matter measurements (total suspended particulates (TSP) and particulate
matter in excess of 10 micrograms (PM,)) are somewhat ambiguous, as the trends are not clearly
downward in all cities and with regard to all three measures (annual average concentration,
maximum hourly concentration, number of hourly intervals exceeding Slovenian limits).
Moreover, in some places, the measuring points shifted from measuring TSP to PMW.
Nevertheless, the general picture talks of improvement with regard to particulate matter.
(c)  The SO2 reductions are discernible consistently throughout all three measures and across
places.
Considering that small stack emissions represent the most significant impact in these improving
trends, overall, it can be said that the project has contributed significantly to the improvement of
ambient air quality in urban concentrations throughout Slovenia.

Global Impact: Estimated Reduction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Although there was no
explicit objective of reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, the APAP Component
has indeed had an effect of reducing carbon dioxide by phasing out C02-intensive lignite and hard
wood, and replacing it with less intensive gas, LPG, gas-oil, to talk about the most important
sub-projects. If, however, the wood is counted as C02-neutral, because of its absorption of CO2
during the growth phase, then the impact of household conversions is relatively small or even
negative in some cases, whereas there remains a significant impact with the boiler house
conversions. The following two tables illustrate the point:

In either case, the net effect of the project is positive in that the component has helped to reduce
CO 2 emissions. Of course, the above tables illustrate the point on an annual basis, whereas the life
of the new installations is at least 10 years, thereby multiplying those above reductions with a
factor of at least ten.

4.3 Net Present Valfte/Econoniic rate of return:
APAP Component (estimated Economic Rates of Return 38% to 62%): The actual, ex-ante
rates of return of individual conversion projects were calculated taking account of monetary
advantages as per experience in the pilot phase of Maribor, estimated consumer surplus, as well as
estimated health benefits. A sample of sub-projects, where estimated monetary benefits were
calculated ex-post, i.e. after project completion, show that they are in line with the original
estimates. Ex-post rates of return have only been calculated on a sample basis and have not
re-estimated consumer surplus and health benefits. But as capital costs were relatively small and
were based essentially on offers, or even draft contracts with contractors, and execution time
typically did not exceed a few months, the ex-ante rates can be considered as reliable proxy for
ex-post rates. This assumes that energy prices have not changed significantly relative to each
other.
GIS Component: Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of retuirn:
APAP Component and GIS Component: Not applicable.
4.5 Instituitional development impact:
The APAP Component of the Project had a considerable development impact on the Ekofund
and on the development of environmental policy in Slovenia. In the beginning of its operation,
when the Ekofund's capital was much lower than now, the World Bank's loan enabled the
Ekofund to offer loans for APAP Program sub-projects. In the beginning of the APAP
Component, the Ekofund had only five people employed, today the Ekofund staff comprises
about 14 persons. The World Bank also assisted the Ekofund to obtain two grants from the
European Union, amounting together to about Euro 1 million, to support the Ekofund's
institutional strengthening (schooling and training of staff, purchase of equipment, financing of
public relation campaigns of the APAP project). Today, the Ekofund is a mature institution which
handles a volume of DM 150 million (US$ 82 million) in loans and grants annually.
The Ekofund chose Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM - the second biggest commercial
bank in Slovenia) after an open tender procedure as a financial agent to administer the
sub-loan-processing for households and boilerhouse owners in its name. As a result of close
cooperation, the Ekofund had a substantial institution-building effect on NKBM. In particular,
the APAP Program helped NKBM to set up a system of country-wide small loan administration
with appropriate procedures and record keeping.
Thus, the APAP Program contributed to developing skills to handle large programs involving
many small private borrowers. The infrastructure has been developed at the Ekofund to manage
procedures from project planning, selecting and contracting financial agents, advertising and
promotion to approving loans, monitoring procurement and disbursement, reporting and
contingency management. Similarly NKBM has learned to administer a large number of small
loans
- 14-



The APAP Program has also influenced the Slovenian financial market to some extent: It
contributed to speed up the market's move towards more competitive interest rates for small
consumer bank loans. At the beginning of the Program, very limited competition between
Slovenian banks allowed high interest rates to prevail, that were not corresponding to the
relatively low risk of lending to individual borrowers. Indeed, banks were skimming the safest
segment of the market, enabling them to lead a rather conservative policy towards the corporate
sector, and avoiding the small consumer loans. This period came to an end in early 1998, when
interest rates fell sharply by 30 to 40 percent.
Last, but not least, the APAP Program had a substantial influence upon two Public Relations
Companies (Pristop and Spem) which had been chosen to do the PR campaigns for the APAP
Program. In 1997 Ekofund has received the United Nations Grand Award from the UN
Department of Public Information. There was also a minor influence upon the institutional
capabilities of some other organizations and institutions such as ITEO (training of Ekofund's staff
for project planning, implementing, monitoring and reporting) and Ministry of Environment and
Physical Planning.
The GIS Component has had a fundamental impact on the institutional aspects of land use
planning, regional development, environmental protection and real estate administration and
taxation. The sub-components described in Section 4.2 above are described in more detail in the
Ministry's completion report of the Component. It is important to underline that the positive
results of this Component have updated legislation, the tools for spatial planning supported
regional development, real estate management as well as environmental protection beyond the
expectations of the Government and are providing significant returns on a very small investment,
relatively speaking.
Thus, Slovenia is now at the leading edge with these tools: The Metadata Standards, the State
Metadata Geographic Information Center (GIC) and the State Geo-Information
Infrastructure (SGII) Sub-Component: The Slovene GIC's Metadata System is established on
the internet under http://www.sigov.si:81/. It supports metadata on approximately 150 State
Source Databases from about 50 Data Providers, several different Ministries. The State GIC was
institutionalized as a separate entity in the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and
partially supported with an appropriate State budget to ensure the continued sustainability and
enhancement of the work program. The GIC is now moved to the Surveying and Mapping
Agency, but has retained the same role, and even more, has a mandate to distribute real estate
databases according to legislation and pricing policy. The Metadata Query and Order Provisioning
System is being enhanced (June 2001) to an integrated metadata and source data browser, user
authorization, accounting and source data provisioning system for nearly all source data in the
Ministry. The above system supports the implementation of Regional GIC systems (to facility the
two way movement of data / information between the State and Municipalities) in support of real
estate valuation / taxation, physical planning, and environmental analysis applications. The above
system is harmonized and integrated with the State Office of Informatics (responsible for all
IT/IM matters in the State). The Government is establishing "Municipal Regional Development
Programs", and it is expected that the ONIX Application Processes and supporting GIC
Infrastructure will become the basis of these programs.
- 15-



The Topographic Evidences and Cadaster Evidences Sub-Components helped develop, under
the ONIX Project Standards, the metadata database for each of the source databases. These
continue to be distributed under the State GIC System.
The Ljubljana Environmental Vulnerability Analysis Sub-Component has developed a
computer-based application and database system to support public and private sector
environmental vulnerability analysis projects. This can now serve as a model for any needed
environmental vulnerability analyses throughout the country. The environmental vulnerability
analysis process developed by the University of Ljubljana is now the accepted analysis process for
State, Municipal, Community and private sector projects. The Proval Environmental Analysis
Computer Application System, following some State support in 2000-2001, is now completely
supported by Proval, a private sector company. The system is being successfully sold and
supported in Slovenia and abroad (more than 150 users).
The Koper Physical Planning Sub-Component developed a computer based "Urbanist
Information System" to provide accurate and timely responses to public physical planning queries
and commercial / residential applications for building permits. For the region of Koper, Izola and
Piran, an integrated Program Council was set up for the purpose of integrating all real estate and
physical planning programs. The Urbanist Information System is now fully operational in Koper.
Other Municipalities are expected to implement similar systems in the next years. Most
importantly, the above processes and standards are recognized by many Municipalities and
Communities as the basis for "pro-active physical planning, real estate zoning, real estate
valuation, -taxation, and Municipal and Community economic and social development.
The Maribor Real-Estate Management Sub-Component has developed a computer based
application system to support the real-estate valuation process and associated databases. A
Real-Estate Valuation Application Software package (along with associated databases of
evidences) was developed, however this system was not implemented in the Municipality of
Maribor. Instead, under the State's institutionalization of the GIC in 2000/2001, the State
initiated an Enhanced Real-Estate Valuation and Taxation Project with the Municipality of Koper
and the Communities of Izola and Piran. This project was successful in completing the objectives
and deliverable of the ONIX Project.
The economic benefits for the Municipalities were proven to be substantial. If implemented
throughout Slovenia, taxation revenue from current "black" buildings and more equitable taxation
of commercial / industrial real-estate would result in about 25 billion SIT / year (about US$100
million). The results of the ONIX Project and the subsequent Koper Regional Project are being
integrated in to the World Bank PEN Project (Ministry of Finance's Real-Estate Valuation
sub-project).
The Training and Training Center Sub-Component helped develop the training material in
support of the ONIX Sub-Components and helped to set up the GIC Training Center. The GIC
Training Center is currently working with the Survey and Mapping Division on the development
of "State Certification Training Programs" for selected SMA processes and data evidence

maintenance programs. Training is expected to continue, notably with regard to the development
of Urbanist Information Systems and other tools useful for the municipalities.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implemeniting agencv:
APAP Component: In the context of this component, the most important factor outside the
immediate and direct control of governnent or implementing agency is the price of money. It
depends mainly on the international money markets, monetary policies of the Central Bank and
the Ministry of Finance, on the level of inflation as well as inflation-expectations of the market, as
well as on the degree of competition in the financial sector. While the implementing agency has
the possibility to influence (minimize) its own costs of loan administration, it has no influence on
(i) market interest rates, and (ii) the changes of the interest rate defined by the lender. The interest
rate of the World Bank changes semiannually in line with LIBOR. The difference between LIBOR
based interest rate and inflation plus real interest rate of commercial banks is of crucial importance
for the success of the Project. In the year 1997 when this difference was large the Project had a
tremendous success; from mid-1998 when the difference started to decline because of declining
interest rates of domestic commercial banks, the demand for the APAP-funding started to decline
as well. On the other hand, the Project had some influence on the consumer loan market fostering
competition, and in a more competitive market, there was less demand for the directed loans that
required, however, more effort to be approved. Thus, the component was highly successful,
helping to contribute to making itself redundant.
The Government and implementing agency also had only a limited influence over the attitude of
consumers who faced the choice of a cheaper APAP loan with a more complex application
process, as compared to a more expensive commercial loan but with simpler application
procedure.  The Ekofund attempted to influence that attitude through annual aggressive
advertising campaigns and other PR measures. Finally, there were only the general ambient air
standards, which Slovenia adopted along the lines of the EU legislation.
GIS Component:     The Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning and the Project
Implementation Unit had selected competitively a Dutch consultant but did not have an influence
over his qualifications and abilities to do the initial assessment works. They had to revert to
selecting a Canadian Consultant after a year of inadequate project progress. Thereafter, work
proceeded smoothly.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
APAP Component: On the environmental side, the government has prescribed the maximum
emissions that are in accordance with EU standards. Moreover, the use of the worst quality of
coal (lignite) is now forbidden for use in households in some regions. Of course, local
Governments could have imposed even stricter standards or even forbid the use of burning coal
altogether from a certain date (as was done in the UK to abate the London smog), but generally,
communities have resisted such extreme measures which might not have been appreciated by the
population who would have reacted in the next round of elections.
The government has also the possibility, at least to some extent and in the medium term, to
- 17 -



influence the level of domestic inflation.
An important factor concerning the outcome of the Project was the cooperation of its
stakeholders and coordination of their efforts, mostly affected by the PIT. The most important
stakeholders were the potential borrowers, bank office network organized by the financial agent,
municipalities, local authorities, local energy service providers, local and country-wide media,
and local contractors. The PIT was aware of the importance to maintain excellent relations with
these stakeholders across the country. Of course, there were collisions of interest in some
municipalities, and not all of the parties involved were willing to cooperate. But on the other
hand, models of cooperation were developed in some towns, including Maribor, Hrastnik,
Piran, Kamnik, Rogaska Slatina, parts of Ljubljana to name just a few, that served as examples of
successful project management in complex situations, where both public institutions and private
corporations were commonly addressing individuals, though often with opposing interests. The
initiative would typically come from service providers, while the PIT would organize and
coordinate efforts towards the goals of the Project - as many boiler conversions as possible in the
shortest possible period. There were also exceptions where the initiative came from municipalities
or even local banks.
GIS Component: Two areas of Project implementation could have been executed better, while
clearly being under the control of the Government. There was, at least during the first phase of
execution, and even, at times, during the second phase, a lack of coordination and, sometimes
even of cooperation, between the many different Ministries and Government Institutions typically
involved in a GIS development activity. But it was the dedication and persistence of the PIU as
well as the frequent, well-managed, and well-attended conferences, training sessions and Public
Relations activities under the Component, which helped to overcome this obstacle to a large
extent. The other issue related to the fact that a component-specific cost-control center was not
set up, given the relatively small amount of overall costs. Thus cost control and audits of the
Component took place only in the general accounting and auditing set-up of the MESP. This
forced the technical manager to run his own system of accounting for costs. Moreover, his life got
further complicated through the fact that his units' disbursement requests were first vetted in the
general MESP accounting office (which however did not keep the needed separate cost
accounting system, and which led to substantial delays), and only then submitted to the Ministry
of Finance for a disbursement request to the World Bank. This again added substantial time,
sometimes several months. As a result, expenditures often got reimbursed by the World Bank
loan only months or even half-years after having been incurred. This led to substantial difficulties
with regard to the PIU's cash flow and general budget, as the PIU often had to request the MESP
to "pre-finance" substantial amounts.  Again, this difficulty was overcome by the solid
management efforts of the PIU.
5.3 Factors generally stubject to implementing agencv control:
APAP Component: With regard to the interest and fees for the sub-loans, the Ekofund
determined all these except for the World Bank interest rate by:
* calculating its costs of operation and adding it to the interest rate of the World Bank (the
interest risk and foreign exchange risk were transferred to the final borrower);
- 18 -



* choosing the financial agent Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM) and endorsing its
proposals for approval- and management fees charged to final borrowers.
The Ekofund used a number of PR- and advertising tools in order to address the stakeholders and
disseminate information about the project. Indeed, public relation management has played an
important role throughout the implementation of the project. In the early period (1996-1998), TV
and radio commercials were produced and regularly broadcast in order to raise public awareness
of the Project and its goals. Printed ads were also commonly used at that time. Due to their lower
cost per exposure, they were also used later in the project cycle until the present time. A
particularly useful, cheap and effective tool were talk-shows at local radio stations, which were
perceived as a very close contact with the local population. More than fifty 20-minute
appearances at 25 radio stations were performed in the period 1996 - 1998. Most of them allowed
for live questions and answers covering the topics of environmental improvements, heating fuel
conversions and possible financing arrangements. Other tools included printed leaflets and teller
stands with basic information on APAP loans, workshops for bank employees and contractors in
regional centers etc. In order to perform these extensive tasks, it was of crucial importance to
train the staff in project and PR management. The Ekofund had this opportunity through a
PHARE project which provided technical assistance in the above mentioned fields.
GIS Component: It was the competence and motivation of the PIU team and its foreign
consultant from mid-1998, which helped to make the Project Component an important success.
The team members were highly qualified, well trained, dedicated and had played the dominant
part in Project conceptualization, definition of objectives, and outlining of the scope, during early
Project preparation. Due to their efforts and enthusiasm, they managed to convince and motivate
the various partners in the Central Government as well as in municipalities and regions, to
cooperate and to help make the various sub components succeed. Often in early meetings they
would face a lack of interest and a questioning attitude among their counterparts. At times they
also had to fight entrenched interests (e.g in the context of the real estate sub-component or
environmental vulnerability analyses). But at the end of a series of initial meetings they had
convinced most of their partners to cooperate in this important endeavor, describing the
substantial benefits of the sub-components for the country as well as for regions and
municipalities.
54 Costs and financing:
APAP Component: Distinction is made between two types of project costs: The costs of
investments of subprojects under the Component on the one hand, and the costs of the
Component management and administration on the other, which was covered largely out of the
financial fees of the Ekofund included in the interest rate to the final borrower.
Sub-project costs: During the period of project implementation, and excluding the pilot phase,
i.e. from mid-1996 to end of September 2000, almost 4700 loans were approved by the
Ekofund with a total loan amount of DM 40 million (US$ 21.9 million), but a total Project cost
of DM 51.7 million (US$ 28.3 million), to help finance conversion of household heating facilities
and small boiler houses from dirty fuels to clean energy sources. Of total Project costs, the World
Bank Loan contributed DM 30 million (US$ 16.4 million) or 58% of total aggregate costs, the
Ekofund DM 10 million (US$ 5.5 million) or 19% of total costs; the amount of owners'
- 19-



contribution was about DM 11.7 million (US$ 6.4 million) or 23% of total project costs. The
legal agreements had envisaged a minimum of 20% from owners, and for the sub-loan financing
75% from the World Bank Loan and 25% from the Ekofund financing. Thus, the actual outcome
is very close to the original estimates. The total amount of investmnents in sub-projects of DM
51.7 million (US$ 28.3 million) is closely in line with the appraisal estimate of DM 50 million
(US$ 27.3 million) (3% cost overrun).
Including the pilot phase and extending the time frame to the end of Year 2000, a total of almost
4950 subprojects were executed with a total Project cost of DM 53.95 million (US$ 29.5 million),
including a total loan amount of DM 41.77 million (US$ 22.8 million). In the following, this
chapter will concentrate on the total Program from the beginning of the pilot phase to end 2000.
Thus, under the total APAP Program until end 2000, almost 4880 conversion projects in
households averaging almost DM 9,100 (US$ 4,970) per sub-project (Appraisal: DM 6,250 [US$
3,400] per sub-project) were undertaken. The range of costs of household projects was from
DM 1,200 (US$ 650) to DM 55,000 (US$ 30,000). In addition, 67 boiler conversion projects at
an average total cost of DM 144,000 (US$ 78,700) (Appraisal: DM 150,000 [US$ 82,0001) were
executed. The range of costs for boiler house conversions was from DM 10,000 (US$ 5,500) to
DM 750,000 (US$ 410,000). In terms of numbers of conversion projects, boilerhouses only
represented a little over 1.3% of the total number; but in terms of Project costs, they represented
almost 18%. Number of subloans, approved, amounts of loans and total sub-project costs are
shown, year by year, in the table of Section 4.2.
Management and administration costs of the project comprised:
(a) costs incurred within the Ekofund (salaries, equipment, premises),
(b) costs incurred outside the Ekofund, of which:
(bl) costs of financial agent Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor,
(b2) other costs, e.g. advertisements and other PR work.
The total costs of the Component over the period of 1995 to December 31, 2000 amounted to
DM 5,422,774 (US$ 2.96 million), representing only 10% of the total Project costs, discussed
above. This is a very reasonable level of costs, considering the huge number of small subloans.
The financing of this cost was assured through:
1. the Ekofund 's margin over World Bank interest rate (from the beginning of the project this
was 2 %, from the year 1999 it was 1,5 %, and from the year 2001 it is I %). It covers the
costs under items (a) and (b2) above, and only a small portion of (b 1) (money transfer fee for
disbursement from the Loan Account of the World Bank and repayments to the World Bank);
2. the final borrowers, who pay the majority of costs under item (bl) (approval and management
fees);
3. EU PHARE grant, which covered some costs under items (a) and (b2) (equipment,
advertisements, schooling) during the early part of APAP.

GIS Component:
At appraisal, the component was estimated to cost DM 5.42 million (US$ 3.0 million), with
computer hard and software, and office supplies (goods) estimated to cost about DM 0.72 million
(US$ 0.4 million or 13% of total) and consultant services estimated at DM 4.7 million (US$ 2.6
million of 87% of the total). Of these, the World Bank loan of DM 4.6 million (US$ 2.5 million
or 85% of total estimated costs) was to fund DM 620,000 (US$ 340,000) of goods and DM 3.98
million (US$ 2.2 million) of services, with the Government providing DM 0.82 million (US$ 0.4
million or about 15% of total estimated costs).
At the end of the Component implementation, the PIU had spent a total of slightly over DM 6
million (US$ 3.3 million). i.e. a cost overrun of about 11%. Of these total actual costs, DM 4.2
million (US$ 2.3 million or about 70%) were disbursed from the World Bank Loan, and over DM
1.8 million (US$ 1.0 million or about 30%) had to be covered by the Government. The remainder
of the World Bank Loan (about DM 0.4 million or 9% of the original loan) was cancelled. It had
not been utilized fully, because of insufficient cost accounting and financial management between
MESP and the Ministry of Finance.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale/vr sustainability rating:
APAP Component: The objective of the Air Pollution Abatement Program was to reduce
ambient concentrations of PM  and sulfur dioxide along with the health damage associated with
exposure to air pollution. Through public relations campaigns, the Ekofund raised public
awareness of the pollution issue of small stack emissions and related health problems. As a result,
even more households and boilerhouse owners than covered by the APAP program, made
conversions from dirty to cleaner heating systems. Many of them used Ekofund loans, which have
been permanently available from the beginning of the project in 1995. Every conversion means a
permanent improvement of a particular pollution source. While small, the sum of all subprojects
has a big result which will be lasting through the lifetime of the new equipment.
GIS Component: In summary, the institutional impact of this small component has been
exceptionally strong, and the support given by the central and local governments will ensure the
Component's further dissemination and applications throughout Slovenia. The PR work has
sensitized the increasingly interested municipalities and regions, which have expressed a desire to
apply similar programs as were developed in selected target areas (see section 4 above). The
training, a vital tool for further dissemination and use of developed systems, now has had over
350 participants of different courses and will be continued in the new training center as well as
with interested municipalities and regions, and, furthermore, in other states of the former Jugoslav
Republic.
6.2 Tranisitioni arrangement to regular operations:
APAP Component:
The Project was expected to disburse all the funds in five years and to continue afterwards on a
revolving principle till 2004 by using loan repayments as further source of financing. The Project
was a big success, because the disbursement occurred even earlier than expected. However,
- 21 -



during the final phase of the project, requests for additional loans decreased substantially. The
approved loan amount in the year 2000 was only about DM 2 million, although the Ekofund
dedicated DM 0,1 million for advertisement campaigns. The supervisory board of the Ekofund
therefore decided to discontinue this component and to use all the funds that will be available in
the future for other projects in other environmental sectors like waste management and water
treatment.
GIS Component:
As described in Section 4 above, the Component has been exceptionally successful in its results
and has led to a much increased awareness throughout Slovenia about the benefits of using the
GIC and its data bases, and the municipal and regional planning and administrative tools for
development, land use planning, real estate administration and taxation, as well as for
environmental protection. Given the many activities ongoing on a central, regional and municipal
level, which, to a large extent already are budgeted and funded, there is no doubt that the results
of this component are replicated throughout the country. This is considered highly satisfactory.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
APAP Component: The Ekofund as the implementing agency rates the Bank performance as
highly satisfactory. The Bank staff provided data and performed their tasks timely and in
accordance with the loan agreement and other legal covenants. The cooperation ran
extraordinarily well in every field and on every level, enabling the project to be completed ahead
of schedule fulfilling all of its goals.
The Ekofund Fund decided to take the single currency loan in DM rather than the currency pool
loan. As this was the first World Bank operation in a single currency, other than the US Dollar,
namely the Deutsche Mark, under the relatively new single currency loan program, this resulted
in a slightly delayed effectiveness of the World Bank loan, and thus the beginning of the Project,
but the Ekofund estimated this delay to be worthwhile, given the familiarity of the Slovenian
public with DM borrowing and resulting foreign exchange risks. Loan disbursement took place in
accordance with the loan agreement and other financial covenants.
The borrower was, however, surprised about the Bank towards the end of the Project (actually
after the final disbursement of the Bank loan) when the Bank's new financial management (FMS)
expert got involved in the project, trying to implement the new FMS rules that were not legally
binding for this Project, as defined in the loan agreement and other legal documents (handbooks,
SAR, etc.), prescribed by the Bank. After getting additional data (regarding the owners'
contributions of individual sub-projects) which he demanded, irrespective of the fact that this
would be prepared for the ICR anyway, and had never been called for in the previous years'
reporting, he found the project data to be in conformity with every legal requirement. The
borrower indicated that he appreciated the right of the lending institution to check upon every
procedure and every transaction within the Project, but pointed out that the legal framework be
respected by anyone addressing a Bank project including the Bank staff.
- 22 -



GIS Component: The Component was well prepared and its objectives spelled out clearly.
However, the exact scope of the component would depend on the findings of the first phase,
which was assessing demand for data, the sources and availability of data as well as willingness of
decision-makers in some of the sub-components to cooperate in the work. Therefore the detailed
design of the Component, ex-ante, was weaker than it could have been after this phase (as in the
case of the APAP component, where detailed project design could rely on the findings of the pilot
phase of Maribor). The slight discrepancies of objectives found between Staff Appraisal Report
and legal agreement resulted from the fact that project objectives and description in legal
agreements are often kept somewhat wider in order to allow for some flexibility during
implementation. This was particularly important here as the detailed design only evolved in the
course of Phase 1. However, the Bank team was instrumental in helping to conceive of the
Project, its objectives and outline of scope, and to bring the Project back on track, when the first
consultant had to be replaced. Thus, the Bank's performance is being judged as satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
APAP Component: Supervision missions were regular. The Ekofund provided all the data
requested and required. World Bank and Ekofund staff made several agreements about further
project implementation that resulted in better outcome of the Project. The total Project
supervision budget, estimated at 41 staff-weeks of Bank staff until completion was exceeded by
17 %.
GIS Component: The component was small (only 10% of the overall environment Project) and
therefore could not be expected to obtain more than a small share of supervision time (10% of
total estimated time would have meant 4 staff weeks). However, at critical points of Component
implementation (e. g. in early 1998, when the Component seemed to loose sight of its key
objectives), the full attention of the Bank staff concentrated on issues and potential solutions.
This greatly contributed to the success of the component.
7.3 Overall Bank per/brrnance:
APAP Component: The Ekofund, as the implementing agency, rated the Bank performance as
highly satisfactory. The Bank staff provided data and performed their tasks timely and in
accordance with the loan agreement and other legal covenants. The cooperation ran
extraordinarily well in every field and on every level, enabling the Project to be completed ahead
of schedule, while fulfilling all of its goals.
GIS Component: Considering the success of the Component, and the inputs provided by Bank
staff to help shape the Project, to help promote its visibility, and to influence execution, the
overall performance should be judged as satisfactory or better.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
APAP Component: The Ekofund prepared the project very well. This was greatly facilitated
through the successful completion of the Maribor Pilot Operation. The Staff Appraisal Report
was prepared in close collaboration between the potential borrower and the World Bank. The
Project Implementation Team (PIT) was established within the Ekofund early during Project
Implementation.
- 23 -



GIS Component: As already mentioned, the Project had a Phase 1 in which its detailed scope and
design had to be substantially refined. It was, however, a conscious decision to leave details of the
design to that phase rather than to attempt to wait with appraisal until more detail was available.
From the point of view of initial staffing and the composition of the PIU, the Project was very
well prepared.
7.5 Government im7plemnenitation performance:
APAP Component: The Governmental representatives in the Administrative Board of the
Ekofund supported and approved the Project. The Governmental representative also signed the
guarantee agreement for the loan 40220 SLO. At times, cooperation with the Meteorological
Institute for the gathering of relevant emission and imission data could have been better.
GIS Component: The performance of the MESP was correct, although it could have set up a
special cost accounting unit (one man, part time) for the Project. The cooperation with the
Ministry of Finance was difficult and led to many delays in Bank disbursement to reimburse the
implementing department of the MESP. On the other hand, the cooperation on the local and
regional level was good once the "ice was broken" and colleagues had been convinced about the
usefulness of the Component - and had been motivated to a degree that they were becoming even
enthusiastic.
7.6 lmplementing Agency:
APAP Component: The Ekofund as the implementing agency made a good choice when it
contracted Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM) as a financial agent to manage and administer
processing and disbursements of individual sub-projects. The Ekofund maintained excellent
relations with the potential borrowers, NKBM's branch-office network, the municipalities
involved, local authorities, local energy service providers, local and country-wide media, and local
contractors. The Ekofund educated homeowners and other investors about the legal requirements
and procedures prior to starting home maintenance and improvement works.
GIS Component:    The performance of the implementing department of the MESP was
outstanding and clearly excellent. The second Consultant was knowledgeable, experienced and
has provided support even beyond the expectation of PIU. Thus the initial difficulties in getting
the design for Phase 2 worked out were overcome in the second half of 1998.
7.7 Overall Borrower peibrnmance:
APAP Component and GIS Component: The Bank staff assessed the performance of the
Ekofund, as well as the PIU at the MESP for the GIS Component, as highly satisfactory. The
cooperation with other Government institutions was satisfactory and better with the exception of
the mentioned examples above. Overall, a highly satisfactory is in place.
8. Lessons Learned
APAP Component: The Ekofund developed skills to handle large projects involving private
borrowers. The infrastructure has been developed at the Ekofund that can manage procedures
from project planning, selecting and contracting financial agents, advertising and promotion to
approving loans, monitoring procurement and disbursement, reporting and contingency

management.
Directed credits with subsidized interest rates are not recommended in well functioning financial
markets, as they distort actual costs and induce potential borrowers to go out of their way to
obtain subsidized funding, thereby also distorting competition. However, they may have their
justification where markets are not yet fully working, as in the case of the banking market of
Slovenia during the mid-199Oies, and in order to promote certain goals. To promote
environmental investments which otherwise may not at all, or only very slowly, have come about,
the low cost-, directed credit of the Ekofund for the funding of air pollution abatement projects
was welcome, timely and successful. And, as the management of the Ekofund pointed out, the
successful implementation of the APAP Component contributed to alerting commercial banks to
compete for this market, so that in the near future the program will no longer be needed.
It is important to carefully design such a program, to keep procedures simple, to conduct regular
PR campaigns and to address potential customers even directly. And the administration of the
Program has to be carefully planned and implemented. This could be achieved through going
through a pilot phase on a limited scope, and to choose professional implementers (Maribor
Bank).
GIS Component: The Component was unusual for many of the Govermnent Institutions, not
familiar with the objectives, purpose, scope and substance of Geographical Information Systems.
Thus, a lot of early "campaigning" had to be done to provide knowledge about GIS and to report
about the multifold benefits which can derive from relatively small investments. This is an
important lesson also for the Bank, as sound development of urban and rural regions,
environmental assessments, real estate markets and property taxation should rely on sound GIS
Systems. Once the understanding is there, a constant and sustained cooperation with the potential
clients and users for the new systems, as well as sustained training of future users, are essential
ingredients to make such a Project successful.
In many of the Bank's client countries in the formner centrally planned economies, modem GIS
systems, along the lines of this Project should be undertaken to reap substantial benefits from the
small investment (in terms of funds). But it also requires substantial investment in human
resources to build the skills and experience with designing and using such systems.
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower,/implementing agency:
APAP Component: The Ekofund comments are described in paragraph 7.3.
GIS Component: Staff of the PIU of the Component in the Ministry of Environment and Spatial
Planning has been complimentary about the Project, support received from the Bank, as well as
the results of the different components to date. The PIU of the GIS Component has also
requested the foreign consultant to prepare a detailed Project Completion Report of its own.
(b) Cofinanciers:
APAP Component: The municipality Hrastnik (Zasavje region) expressed satisfaction with the
project. They financed a gas network and were interested in fast household connections. They
awarded grants to households, who performed gas connections with the support of loans from the
- 25 -



Ekofund, to help cover a portion of their investment.
GIS Component: none
(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
APAP Component & GIS Component: During a number of contacts with clients of the APAP
Component as well as during PR campaigns for the GIS Component which Bank staff attended, a
very positive feed back was received from all these contacts. Regarding the APAP clients, none
expressed disappointment or difficulties with obtaining the funding. None complained about the
debt service arrangements or the loan administration, on the contrary, most people were highly
complimentary about the APAP Program.
In the PR sessions of the GIS Component, Bank staff had an opportunity to meet local
Government representatives as well as entrepreneurs interested in real estate, other service
sectors, and from industry. Everyone encountered was rather interested in the Component and its
outcomes, and some people were enthusiastic about the possibilities which the GIC and its
databases and systems would open up.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
APAP Component: Calculations of rates of return, ex-post, for sub-projects, including health
benefits and consumers' surplus, would be difficult, costly and time consuming, and finally, of
questionable reliability. The health-benefits and consumers' surplus, ex-ante, had been estimated
systematically, but using a fair number of assumptions. As most household conversions involved
indeed conversions from individually-fired ovens and stoves, using wood and coal (mostly
domestic lignite and low quality imported coal), the consumers' surplus, relating to savings in time
and efforts in the daily start-up and maintenance of the individual heating facilities prior to
conversion, has indeed been substantial and very likely in line with estimations of the appraisal. To
measure the exact actual health benefits would be next to impossible, as it would require hospital
statistics as to the reduction of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, and even rates of death related
to respiratory and pulmonary causes. As a proxy for this, the reduction of environmental
pollution, both in terms of reduced emissions and in terms of improvements in ambient air quality,
has to suffice: this ICR assumes that the health benefits, ex-post, are similar to the ones estimated
ex-ante. Thus remain the "normal economic benefits" resulting from switching from coal- or
oil-firing to gas, LPG, gas-oil, district heat, to name the more important ones. As prices for oil
and gas, during the implementation of the Project, have increased faster than those for local wood
and coal, the "normal benefits of conversions" will be somewhat lower than estimated ex- ante.
Below, two cases of conversions have been calculated, ex-post, and compared with the "normal
rates of return" ex-ante, i.e. excluding consumer surplus and health benefits. These calculations
confirm the thesis, spelled out above. In any case, the most important benefits were the consumer
surplus (also in the eye of customers), as well as local environmental benefits, at appraisal and
now, ex-post. There were also important social impacts of the project, since over two thirds of
individual borrowers belonged to lower middle-class and poorer strata of society, their income
being below the average for Slovenia (about DM 1,000 or about US$ 450). Around 15% of the
borrowers earned only half of that amount, which places them among the Nation's absolutely
poorest, unable to invest money into the lasting goods without notable assistance.
The following paragraphs provide three examples of internal rate of return calculations:
Example 1: Refurbishment and Conversion of an old CHP plant with heat demand driving
capacity utilization (power being a by-product). A majority heavy fuel oil fired facility with some
gas use before conversion. Fuel use prior to Project: Heavy Fuel Oil: 1,540 tons at a cost of
about DM0.52 million, Sulfur content of oil 1.1%; Gas: 500 thousand m3 at a cost of DM0.15
million. Maintenance cost of DM7,415 per year. Conversion Project involved an investment of
DM 0.37 million. Fuel use now: Gas, 1.6 million m3, cost about 0.51 million, maintenance of DM
7,017 per year. Based on the investment costs and net cash savings between the with- and
without-project case, the incremental internal rate of return (IRR) yields 42%, which is
certainly a very good return, without accounting for environmental improvements and consumer
surplus.
Exvample 2: Conversion of heat-only boilers (HOBs) from oil firing to gas firing. Fuel use before
conversion: 180 tons at a cost of DM 78 thousand, sulfur content of oil above 1%. Maintenance
cost DM5,600 per year. The conversion Project involved investments of DM 0.292 million, with a
use of 150 thousand m3 of gas and a maintenance cost of DM4,400 per year. Based on the
- 31 -



investment costs and net cash savings between the with- and without-project case, the
incremental IRR yields 13%, which is a marginal return, but again does not account for
environmental improvements and consumer surplus. The return is rather low, given the relatively
high cost of gas, but is in line with the estimated average economic return ex ante (at appraisal).
Other Examples: There were a number of solar heating installations, providing for
complementary heat and hot water generation in addition to gas or gas-oil-fired heat generation.
As an example, one such installation for a one family dwelling involved a total cost of less than
DM3,000, comprising four solar panel collectors, a pump, expansion vessel and installation.
Unfortunately, no data could be made available about the resulting savings as yet, as the
installation took place only in year 2000. However, it is estimated that the installation could yield
annual savings of maximum 25Gj per year. Assuming a price of maximum DM12 per GJ saved,
considering running costs as negligible, and running the installation over 10 years would yield an
incremental IRR of 0%, whereas with a life-cycle time of 15 years the savings would bring the
IRR to 6%. Here it is obvious that even under a favorable conditions the installation of solar
panels does not yet bring substantial economic benefits, but must be seen in the light of reduced
air pollution. This is also the explanation, why only about 30 such installations have been financed
out of the total number of almost 5000 sub-projects. Similarly the economic return for heat
pumps is rather low as compared to gas or gas-oil firing. On the other hand the low number of
DH connections is due to the fact that this was typically funded through the DH companies
already. There, the economic return should be in the order of 10 to 20% for the consumer.
Thus the economic IRR for the sub-projects has a wide range (from zero to 42% in our examples
above). It is estimated that on average the rate of return for the 500 projects will be around 10%
to 15% which is in line with the appraisal estimate of 13 %. In addition, accounting for consumer
surplus and environmental benefits, would push the IRR likely well over 30% as explained in
Annex 3-1 of the SAR.
GIS Component: The economic costs of the component are comparable to the financial costs
contained in Annex 2. The economic benefits are multi-fold: Better geographical data and related
tools to use them, allow better land-use planning, attention to environmental issues in regions,
improved designation of private and public real estate, and therefore improved accessibility of real
estate data, facilitating real estate transactions involving commercial bank funds, as well as a
better ability to provide for transparent taxation of land ownership and use. The systems
developed are in line with advanced EU requirements too, thereby helping Slovenia to meet EU
conditions in her efforts towards EU accession.
A rate of return calculation is not applicable.
