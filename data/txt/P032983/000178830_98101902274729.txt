REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
AN INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Spain for the equivalent of US$18 million to help finance an industrial
research development and engineering (RD&E) project. The loan would have a
term of 13 years, including three years of grace, with interest at 8.2 per-
cent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last regular economic mission visited Spain in 1970; its report
(R71-140), is dated May 20, 1971. Except for a review of the Spanish indus-
trial sector in November 1971, economic work since that time has been limited
to occasional collection of information mostly in conjunction with operational
missions. This material and information from other sources is reflected in
this report. Country data are attached in Annex I.
Spain's Economic Transformation
3.        The years between 1960 and 1974 stand out as a period of rapid
economic growth and structural changes which saw Spain's transformation into
an essentially industrial nation. During 1960-74, GNP expanded in real terms
on average by 7.2 percent per year, one of the highest rates achieved among
developing countries, and the second highest, after Japan, among OECD coun-
tries. Spain's GNP per capita, growing at an average annual rate of over
6 percent during this period, reached US$2,700 in 1975. 1/ This rapid growth
and the accompanying large scale absorption of labor force from the tradi-
tional sectors, especially agriculture, into the modern sector, and the rapid
increase of real wages and salaries has led to sizeable improvements in the
distribution of income.
4.        Industry, the leading growth sector, expanded at an average rate
of 9.8 percent per year during 1960-74. As a result, the share of industry
in GDP at factor cost rose to around 39 percent in 1975, from approximately
30 percent in 1960. The service sectors, also reflected in their share
in GDP at constant factor cost, appear to have maintained their combined
relative weight in the economy, hovering around 48-52 percent. Agriculture,
however, declined significantly in importance, as its share in GDP dropped
to about 9 percent in 1975, a ratio typically found among more developed
countries.

5.        The intensity of these structural changes involved major shifts
in the composition of Spain's labor force and the emergence of unprecedented
migratory movements, both within Spain and abroad. During 1960-75 Spain's
agricultural labor force declined by 2.2 million to 2.8 million, and its
share in total labor force dropped from 43 percent to 21 percent. While the
share of the labor force engaged in industry increased only from 30 percent to
38 percent during this period, the service sectors became the most important
source of domestic employment. Mainly as a result of domestic employment
creation and a labor legislation inhibiting the discharge of redundant workers,
open unemployment had not been a serious problem in the past. The employment
situation was furthermore alleviated by a substantial emigration of labor
abroad, mainly to Western Europe, and a comparatively low participation of
female labor.
6.        Spain's impressive economic surge was facilitated by economic
liberalization and high levels of savings and investment. During the last
decade average investment expenditure have amounted to about 24 percent of
GNP and, until 1974, national savings were of equal magnitude. Most of the
investment financing was provided by plowed back profits, the banking system
and capital markets. Savings and investment by central and local governments
and the social security system were in the order of 3 percent of GNP.
7.        Rapidly rising foreign exchange inflows from commodity exports,
tourism, workers' remittances and foreign private investors strongly supported
the country's economic transformation by removing foreign exchange constraints
on growth and opening up the economy to foreign technologies and know-how.
Despite the very strong growth of imports of investment goods, raw materials
and semi-manufactures and, to some lesser extent, rising food imports, which
together caused persistently high trade deficits (averaging some US$1.8 billion
during 1965-70 and US$2.5 billion during 1971-73), it was possible to keep the
balance of payments deficits on current account during the 1960's at tolerable
levels, and to generate surpluses during 1970-73. On the average of 1965-73,
net earnings from tourism alone helped offset 77 percent of the trade deficit.
In 1973, when Spain was visited by 34.6 million tourists, net earnings from
tourism had reached a volume of about US$3.2 billion, while workers' remit-
tances came to US$0.9 billion.
8.        Owing to substantial net inflows of medium- and long-term capital,
primarily from private sources, Spain's basic balance also showed surpluses
from 1967 to 1973. The net inflow of private medium- and long-term capital
averaged about US$640 million a year during this period, of which 74 percent
was accounted for by direct, portfolio and real estate investments. Public
medium- and long-term capital inflows had been at moderate levels through-
out the period, with amortizations exceeding disbursements during 1970-73.
9.        The favorable development of Spain's balance of payments had led
to a strong accumulation of foreign exchange reserves during 1970-73. At the
end of 1973, total reserves stood at US$6.8 billion, equivalent to eight months
of imports of goods and non-factor services.



10.       While the stage of economic development and the process of integra-
tion with world markets advanced very far from the conditions of the past,
important institutional deficiencies and structural weaknesses at the sectoral
level have persisted, posing some difficult problems of adjustment in the
future, particularly in view of the expected closer relationship to the Euro-
pean Common Market. The relative size of the public sector has changed little
over the past decade despite increasing demand for social services and eco-
nomic infrastructure. With mounting social pressures for further improvements
in the fields of social security, health, education and other basic services,
and a deficient tax system that is still heavily based on indirect taxes and
payroll taxes (the overall ratio of taxes in GNP was only about 13 percent in
1975), Spain's fiscal system is in urgent need of overhaul. In industry, much
of the past growth was based on imported technology, while competitiveness
was maintained by labor cost advantages and the capability to produce in small
series with flexibility of the output mix which more advanced industrial coun-
tries could not afford anymore at competitive prices. Despite the rapid devel-
opment of new large-size industries, Spain's industrial structure remains
dominated by small- and medium- scale family-based enterprises.
11.       The inherent structural and managerial weaknesses in industry and,
what follows from this, the neglected efforts to strengthen industrial capa-
bilities in product development and marketing had been less evident and
apparently less urgent to overcome as long as the Spanish economy benefitted
from a fast growing world economy. These conditions, however, no longer exist.
Recent Economic Developments
12.       Sharply increased petroleum prices and the recession in other OECD
countries have, since 1974, caused a reversal Iq Spanish economic conditions
and have given rise to major economic problems. Fi-r-s-t to be affected was
the balance of payments. Mainly because of much higher payments for imports,
stagnating earnings from tourism and a decline in workers remittances,
Spain's balance of payments on current account reversed from a surplus of
US$550 million in 1973 to deficits of around US$3.1 billion in 1974 and
US$3.5 billion in 1975. Preliminary estimates for 1976 place the current
account deficit at about US$4.2 billion.
13.       Only through a substantial increase in foreign borrowings from
suppliers and institutional lenders could a critical loss of foreign exchange
reserves be avoided. In addition to drawing on the IMF oil facility in the
equivalent of US$581 million in 1975, Spain resorted particularly to Euro-
currency loans in excess of US$1.0 million each in 1974 and 1975, and for
the first nine months of 1976 the recorded borrowing from the international
capital market approached US$1.5 billion; in August 1976 a loan in the amount
of US$1.0 billion was syndicated, one of the largest such loans ever reported.
Due to these efforts, the level of reserves declined only slightly to US$5.3
billion (by the end of 1976), equivalent to about four months' of imports. In
order to improve the balance of payments situation, the peseta was depreciated
against the US dollar by about 10 percent in February 1976, and had floated



- 4 -
downwards by another 3 percent by end 1976. In October 1976 the Government
took a further step to curb imports by introducing a temporary surcharge of
20 percent on the import duties of a large number of commodities.
14.       Spain entered the recession later than the other OECD countries.
In 1974, the real growth rate of GDP was still 4.9 percent, down from over
eight percent in both 1972 and 1973. In 1975, however, GDP growth came to
a virtual standstill as real value added in manufacturing and construction
declined. Preliminary estimates for 1976 suggest a continuing sluggish
growth with a real growth rate of GDP below 2 percent, resulting mainly from
the drop in fixed investment in 1975 and the continuing depressed investment
climate. The recession was accompanied by a sharp rise in unemployment. By
the end of 1976, unemployment had risen to about 800,000, equivalent to 6 per-
cent of the labor force, the highest level in 20 years.
15.       Slow economic growth was accompanied by rising inflationary pres-
sure. Consumer prices in 1976 are estimated to have increased by some 20
percent, after 17 percent during the previous year. In addition to "imported
inflation", which had its strongest impact in 1974, there have been important
cost-push elements. Workers have tried to maintain the past upward trend in
real wages (with a cumulative increase in the index of constant price hourly
earnings in industry and services in excess of 30 percent during 1974 to 1976),
while firms have frequently sought to maintain profits by price increases in
excess of the rise in unit costs. In addition, the central government tried
to stimulate private and public investment through tax rebates and public
works programs, which resulted in some deficit financing via monetary expan-
sion. In order to counter the inflationary pressures, the Government extended
in October the system of price controls to a large number of goods and services
and tightened it by introducing new detailed rules as to the determination of
any permissible price increases. The expected dampening of the cost of living
rise is deemed necessary if the wage restraints, introduced on the same date,
are to be politically acceptable.
Short-term Prospects
16.       Spain's current economic problems coincide with the difficult period
of political transition following the death of Generalissimo Franco. Thus, the
primary concern of the current Spanish leadership over the direction and pace
of political reform has acted as a restraint on domestic economic policies. As
a result, economic decision-making is currently focussing mainly on the dif-
ficult task of stimulating the economy while keeping inflation under control
through ad hoc measures. Under the circumstances--with Spain's first parlia-
mentary election scheduled for June 15, 1977--medium- and long-term programs
for economic development, and institutional and structural reforms would have
to wait for the post-election period. However, unless these programs and re-
forms are initiated in due course, Spain's eventual accession to the European
Communities, although not likely to take place before the early 1980's, would
be further complicated.



- 5 -
17.       In the short run it appears that the complex problems of economic
management will cause some degree of uncertainty, with adverse effects on in-
vestment, employment and output. Spain's economic recovery will, therefore,
probably lag behind that of other OECD countries for some while. The country
has, however, ample scope to improve productivity both in industry and in
agriculture which would permit expansion of exports to OECD countries. There
is also scope for considerable expansion of exports to new markets, partic-
ularly to Middle Eastern countries with which Spain is developing increasingly
close relations. The economic recovery in Western Europe is expected to revive
the tourism sector which stagnated for several years.
Creditworthiness and External Debt
18.       Increased foreign exchange earnings should, in due course, lead to
a reduction of the balance of payments deficits and external borrowing require-
ments. So far, Spain has not encountered any difficulties in raising the funds
needed to maintain adequate external liquidity. Neither the total amount of
borrowing in relation to the size of the economy and its growth potential nor
the debt-service ratio give rise to serious doubts as to the creditworthiness,
provided Spain can overcome within the next few years its current balance of
payments problems. This seems also to be the prevailing judgment of the inter-
national banking community, as demonstrated by the eagerness with which foreign
banks lined up to participate in the recent Euro-currency loan. Spain is also
actively diversifying its sources of foreign borrowing, as indicated by the
recent Kuwaiti Government guarantee of a bond issue reportedly in the equiva-
lent of US$500 million, to be raised in Kuwait and other Arab countries; in
February 1977 negotiations for a similar loan in the amount of $150 million
from Saudi Arabia were announced. The Spanish Government is confident as to
its future borrowing capacity.
19.       Total public medium- and long-term debt (disbursed) at the end of
1975 amounted to US$3.33 billion, with Bank loans accounting for 7.5 percent
of the total. Due to the heavy private borrowing during the recent years,
total outstanding medium- and long-term loans (including a sizeable undis-
bursed portion) reportedly amounted to around US$11 billion by the end of
1976. Debt service payments on public debt were about 2.5 percent of foreign
exchange earnings and total debt service ratio was about 9.1 percent for 1975.
Amortization and interest on Bank loans amounted to about 9 percent of total
public debt service payments.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN SPAIN
20.       The proposed loan, the Bank's twelfth operation in Spain, would
bring total Bank lending to $416.3 million (net of cancellations). The net
amount outstanding and held by the Bank as of March 31, 1977 was $301.6 mil-
lion, of which $58.3 million was undisbursed.



- 6 -
21.       Six loans, totalling $328 million, have been made in the trans-
portation sector, one for highways ($33 million), three for railways ($205
million), and two for ports ($90 million). The Highways Loan of 1963
(No. 360-SP) which financed road improvements also made provision for a pilot
highway maintenance program, as a first step towards a nationwide maintenance
system. The autonomous State Railways (RENFE), recipient of three Bank loans
in 1964 (No. 387-SP), 1967 (No. 507-SP) and 1971 (No. 772-SP), has been trans-
formed from an obsolete enterprise into a modern and efficient railway system
that now compares favorably with other European railways. A performance audit
of the Railways loans (dated December 27, 1974) by the Operations Evaluation
Department notes the good results achieved by RENFE and attributes them to
RENFE's internal efficiency, the suitability of the Bank's approach and its
sustained and timely attention, the quality of the consultant's work and the
fact that they remained for the several years required, and the rapid growth
of the Spanish economy, which facilitated absorption of personnel eliminated
from RENFE and maintained total demand for transport services. However,
beginning in 1975 Spanish Railways, in line with other European railways, were
seriously affected by the recession and this was exacerbated by the internal
political instabilities. Tariff increases, cost-cutting measures and new
transport regulatory measures which could not be implemented caused serious
financial problems. As Spain's financial and political problems are overcome
and it becomes possible to introduce the necessary increases in tariffs the
improved operational and organizational efficiency should be of considerable
assistance in the restoration of Spanish Railway's profitability. Two loans
have been made for Port Development (Nos. 429-SP of 1965 and (884-SP of 1973).
Approximately $19 million of Loan 884-SP remains undisbursed. Notwithstanding
the fact that implementation of the second project has been delayed largely as
a result of substantial cost overruns it is recognized that Bank involvement
through these two projects has resulted in major institutional and financial
changes, particularly in respect of port administration and the preparation
of development plans. The Ports Authorities, like the Railways, are currently
encountering financial problems resulting from their inability to increase
tariffs sufficiently to fully off-set inflation.
22.       The Bank has made three agricultural loans, two for livestock
development ($25 million loans in both 1969 and 1975) and a $12.7 million
loan for agricultural research in 1971. The purpose of the agricultural
research project was to raise the standard of research through the restruc-
turing of the key official research organization, INIA (Instituto Nacional
de Investigaciones Agronomicas) and reorienting its research activity on a
commodity-oriented basis.    This was the first project of this type under-
taken by the Bank. Execution of this project was delayed initially by a
time-consuming reorganization of INIA during which the government's financial
and administrative support for the project was inadequate. Following
the appointment of a new President of INIA in April 1974 support for the
concept of commodity-oriented research became much stronger and project
implementation improved considerably. During 1976 implementation was again
delayed. As a result of Spain's overall financial constraints arising from
the recession, inadequate funding was provided and, in addition, the political
transition gave rise to a number of changes in ministerial and managerial



positions in the Ministry of Agriculture and INIA. The Presidency of INIA
changed hands twice during 1976. These changes at the policy making level
were not conducive to good management and served as an additional obstacle
to project implementation. However, agricultural research, including the
Bank project, continues to enjoy the support of the Spanish Government.
Adequate funds to implement the program during 1977 have now been provided
and the contract with the consultants responsible for managing and coordinat-
ing the research program has been extended through the end of the year.
23.       At the request of the Government of Spain the Bank agreed in late
1975 to consider providing additional funding to expand the agricultural
research projects underway and to initiate new research activities. Such a
project was appraised in November/December 1975 and it was intended that a
separate component for agricultural research would be provided under the new
loan proposed for industrial RD&E. However, in the end, the Government con-
cluded that, given its financial constraints and the need to fully support
the research activities already initiated, it could not provide additional
funds for even a minimum size project, and therefore withdrew its request
for additional funding for agricultural research.
24.       The Bank also made two loans for education, in 1970 and 1972,
totalling $62 million. During the implementation of these loans, there were
frequent changes in the leadership of the Education Ministry, and significant
uncertainty concerning the Government's intention to implement the educa-
tional reform program adopted by the Government in 1970. Due to the growing
pressure on the Government to build more basic education schools, combined
with increased construction costs, the Government decided it would not follow
the standards of student accommodation envisaged in the projects, but instead
would significantly reduce the resources devoted to pre-technical training.
In the Bank's judgment, improvement in this field was a key element in the
educational reform. Consequently, the Bank did not accept the revisions
proposed in the project by the Government, and at the request of the Govern-
ment the undisbursed balance of these loans amounting to $61.5 million was
cancelled on March 25, 1975. (Report to Executive Directors on Bank and IDA
Operations, dated April 3, 1975 - R75-52.)
25.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC invest-
ments as of March 31, 1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
26.       Despite the recent deterioration in Spain's balance of payments,
its reserves, export potential and access to foreign capital markets should
ensure the availability of adequate external financing for its continued
economic development. In view of this and of Spain's relatively high income
level, the proposed loan is the last contemplated for Spain.
27.       IFC has made investments in four Spanish enterprises totalling
$18.8 million (see Annex II, page 2). The loans to Fabrica Espanola Magnetos,
S.A. (FEMSA - an automotive' electrical equipment manufacturer), Banco del
Desarollo Economico Espanol, S.A. (BANDESCO), Industrias del Papel y de la
Celulosa, S.A. (INPACSA), a pulp and paper manufacturer, have been fully



- 8 -
disbursed, and repaid, and IFC has sold its shareholdings in these enter-
prises. A loan of $4.4 million to Industries de Tableros y de Derivados
de Madera was signed June 21, 1974, with an IFC equity participation of
$0.9 million, the total amounting to $5.3 million.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
28.       During the last ten years, industry's contribution to Spain's GDP
has been increasing, while agriculture's share has been declining. In neither
sector has research to improve the technology of production and develop new
or improved products kept up with the requirements of Spain's rapidly devel-
oping economy. This weakness in research support has resulted from somewhat
similar causes in both sectors, although the institutional framework for
industrial research is quite different from that for agriculture.
Characteristics of the Industrial Sector
29.       Despite the rapid development of new large-size industries since
1960 Spain's industrial structure remains dominated by the small-scale,
family-based enterprise, which in the past had been able to remain competitive
because of the relatively low labor costs and its capacity to produce in small
individual series and with a high product flexibility. The new industries
have been mostly large-scale and capital-intensive, utilizing up-to-date
equipment and modern foreign technologies, frequently through direct foreign
participation.
30.       While Spain's industrial growth in the 1960's was induced mainly
by rapidly expanding domestic demand, export sales have become much more
important over the last decade. In 1974 about 14 percent of manufacturing
output was exported as compared to five percent in 1961. During the same
period industrial exports rose from US$150 million to US$4.1 billion, and
their total share in commodity exports rose from 21 to 58 percent.
31.       Many of the comparative advantages on which Spain's industrial
successes were based are gradually diminishing however. For example, Spanish
labor costs, including social security costs, have increased very rapidly in
recent years and will probably continue to rise faster than in other Western
European countries. With labor costs now getting closer to those in other
Western European countries, Spanish industry can no longer depend for its
competitiveness on cheap labor. This has implications also for the capability
of Spanish firms to accommodate small orders with varying specifications.
32.       The gradual disappearance of previously important comparative
advantages occurs during a period of increasing integration with the European
Communities (EC) (which in 1974 absorbed about 42 percent of Spanish indus-
trial output) and changed economic conditions in OECD countries. These
developments have put additional competitive pressures on Spanish enterprises
and given further evidence of the serious weaknesses in Spain's industrial



- 9 -
structure and in industrial management. Concentrated efforts from industry
and the Government will be required to prevent a further erosion of current
competitive positions. In view of the prospects of a much closer economic
integration with the EC, vigorous and selective efforts must begin now to
develop technologically improved processes and products in areas in which
Spain can expect to be competitive.
33.       It needs to be stressed that without such efforts to improve pro-
ducts, processes and productivity, including, but not restricted to, the pro-
posed project, the necessary adjustments would not only be unduly delayed and
probably too little to be effective but would also lead to a situation in
which Spain might find itself losing its competitive edge, and its capability
to grow and compete in expanded markets, particularly the EC.
Role of Research, Development and Engineering (RD&E)
34.       Although expenditures on RD&E have been rising rapidly in the last
few years, total allocations for it are still small, are spread too thinly over
too many fields, and are supporting too many institutions which are often very
small in size and lacking in significant impact on technological improvements.
In 1974 payments by Spanish industry for licenses, royalties, and technical
assistance amounted to about US$316 million and rose to approximately $500
million in 1975. The cost of dependence on foreign technology has been high,
and often at the cost of conditions imposed by the foreign seller that have
limited the ability of Spanish enterprises to export and to compete in foreign
markets.
35.       There is not now any institution in Spain with responsibility for
the systematic support and exploration of industrial research and development
opportunities and the engineering of new products. There are scattered pro-
grams of support but they lack breadth of coverage in problems and in sector
representation. Of industrial RD&E spending, only little more than half is
accounted for by private enterprises, and there are currently no tax or other
incentives designed to promote research activities. Lack of venture capital,
the conservatism of the banking system, and the fragmentation of existing
programs are also inhibiting factors. Thus the establishment of an RD&E
program that will help to fulfill industry's needs requires provision of both
resources and the institutional means.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       Spanish officials concerned with the long-range strengthening of
Spain's industrial sector have for some time been aware of the need to improve
both the quality and the quantity of research in support of Spain's long-term
economic development. In the mid-1960's, the Spanish authorities discussed
with the OECD, the Bank, and other organizations a possible program to improve
industrial research. A feasibility study by consultants was commissioned by
the Ministry of Industries in 1975 after discussions with a Bank mission which
followed the Bank's Economic Report of 1971 and an industrial sector study,



- 10 -
completed in 1972.  These reports and studies identified industrial research
as a key element in long-term development. The proposed project is intended
to encourage and increase the quality and quantity of efforts to develop new
products and processes, and to bring them to the point of commercial exploita-
tion.
37.       The proposed project was appraised by missions which visited Spain
in November/December 1975 and May 1976. Processing of the project has been
delayed by prolonged but abortive discussions between the Government and the
Bank regarding possible additional lending for agricultural research as a
component of the proposed loan (see para 23).
38.       Negotiations were held in Washington in March, 1977 with a Spanish
delegation, which was led by Don Gregorio Gutierrez Escudero and comprised of
representatives from the Ministries of Commerce, Industry and Finance.
Project Description
39.       This project, the first of its kind to be undertaken by the Bank,
would establish an organization (RD&E Unit) and provide it with the required
technical capabilities to carry out research, development and engineering
operations intended to develop new products and processes in related indus-
trial fields, under specified criteria and procedures agreed between the
Spanish Government and the Bank (see para 49).
Organization and Plan of Operation
40.       The RD&E Unit would be established initially within the Ministry
of Industry and would survey available technology and resources of Spanish
industry for the purpose of evaluating its capacity to develop new processes
and products likely to be competitive in future markets. In close coopera-
tion with industry, the RD&E Unit would then conduct market studies, identify
product lines and marketing strategies and commission, finance and supervise
the necessary research, development, design and engineering activities required
to develop the technologies and adapt them to Spanish conditions. Although
some specialized studies may be contracted abroad most of the activities would
be carried out in Spanish institutions and laboratories in both the public and
private sector, largely in existing industrial firms. The patent rights to
products or processes produced wholly or dominantly from RD&E Unit contracts
or funding would belong to the RD&E Unit, but licenses for use would be made
freely available to all domestic manufacturers upon payment of reasonable
royalties, which would be determined by the Managing Director and approved by
the Board of the RD&E Unit. Commercial exploitation of the products resulting
from this development effort would be the responsibility of public and private
enterprises. The RD&E Unit would not engage in commercial activities nor
provide funds for that purpose.
41.       A draft Decree for the establishment of the RD&E Unit, detailing its
functions and organization and the responsibilities of the Board of Directors
and the Managing Director has been prepared. This draft Decree, which has



been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory, is expected to be submitted
to the Council of Ministers for final approval immediately following the sign-
ing of the proposed loan. Its promulgation is a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan (Section 5.01(i) of draft Loan Agreement).
42.       Ideally, the RD&E Unit should be an autonomous organization from
its inception, to provide maximum independence of action and to enable it
to receive income from sources other than the Ministry of Industry's budget,
such as royalties from the sale or licensing of patents. However, since
passage of legislation required to establish an autonomous organization is
likely to take some time, and since outside income is unlikely to be received
for several years, the RD&E Unit would be established initially as a servicio
publico centralizado sin personalidad luridica, within the Ministry of Industry.
As soon as possible, but not later than the end of 1979 the Government has
agreed to submit a draft law to the legislative body to transform the RD&E
Unit into an autonomous organization. It is projected that the program of the
RD&E Unit could become self-sustaining after 8 years and the Government has
undertaken to provide all funds necessary to enable the unit to carry on its
operations at least for that period.
43.       The RD&E Unit would be headed by a Managing Director operating under
the direction of a Board of Directors (Governing Council). It would have a
small permanent staff of about ten professionals and would establish ad hoc
task forces for specific assignments.
44.       The Board of Directors would be appointed by the Minister of Indus-
try and would be comprised of three Directors-General from the Ministry of
Industry, five representatives prominent at the managerial level in industry,
engineering and consulting firms, and two representatives of research centers.
The Board would be under the Chairmanship of the Director-General for Indus-
trial Promotion and Technology. Staggered terms of appointment would ensure
a continuous flow of ideas between the RD&E Unit and Spanish institutions con-
cerned with industrial technology.
45.       The Board of Directors would supervise the management of the RD&E
Unit, maintain a continuous dialogue and cooperate with industry and research
centers, approve the Unit's plan of activities and development programs and
approve the Annual Report.
46.       The Managing Director would have had extensive experience in private
industry and would be appointed by the Minister of Industry in consultation
with the Bank. His appointment would be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan, (Section 5.01(ii) of the draft Loan Agreement). Although the
Managing Director would report to the Chairman of the Board he would operate
independently, hire and dismiss staff, launch and terminate studies, prepare
and allocate the budget, authorize contracts for outside research and approve
arrangements for participation of industry.
47.       The small permanent staff would consist of specialists in the fields
of markets forecasting, new product and process development and technological
promotions. The ad hoc task forces, which would be established as required to



- 12 -
provide technical assistance in the execution of specific sub-projects by
prime contractors, would be comprised of specialists recruited from industry,
universities, research agencies and consulting firms, from both within and
outside Spain, for appropriate fixed periods.
48.       The criteria and procedures established by the Government of Spain
for the selection of sub-projects have been reviewed by the Bank and found
satisfactory. Since it is intended that Spanish industry should be the
beneficiary, only sub-projects of the kind capable of being absorbed within
existing Spanish industry would be selected. Projects would be required to
be innovative and would be judged on their prospective contribution to the
market competitiveness of civilian Spanish industry, judged on techno-economic
criteria. Projects solely aimed at improving aesthetic forms and designs
would not be eligible for financing. The main criteria for selection would
be that reasonable prospects exist for the development of new products or
processes that will build principally on Spain's comparative advantage in
existing industries.
49.       During the first three years of project implementation, the choice
of sub-projects estimated to cost more than $500,000 would be made in con-
sultation with the Bank. Based upon studies already under way sub-projects
in electronics, mechanical engineering and food industries are likely to re-
ceive preference initially. These are among the most promising sub-sectors
for the promotion of technological development.
Project Costs and Financing
50.       This project represents a new type of venture for the Bank and can-
not at this time be related to ongoing project activities. Cost estimates
have therefore been derived from the experience of Government supported indus-
trial research projects during the recent past, the experience of Instituto
Nacional de Industria (INI) enterprises and the Bank's evaluation of the com-
position of expenditures in other similar research projects.
51.       In order to achieve the objective of the program becoming self-
supporting in eight years, by deriving sufficient revenues from royalties
for products and processes developed, it is estimated that an average of about
nine projects per year would be the minimum program required. While the cost
of projects will vary considerably, an average cost per project of about
$745,000, spread over the estimated three year RD&E phase has been derived.
Based upon these assumptions the estimated cost of the proposed project over
the first five years would be $40.3 million of which the foreign exchange
component is estimated at about $19.8 million.
52.       The proposed $18.0 million Bank loan would finance most of the
estimated foreign exchange cost of imported test equipment and machinery
and foreign technical services. The proceeds of the proposed loan, and
the Government contribution ($22.3 million), will be made available to the
RD&E Unit on a grant basis since the RD&E Unit will have no source of revenues
unless and until such time as it begins to receive royalties from the licens-
ing of patent rights for products or processes to be developed under the
project.



- 13 -
Audit
53.       The accounts of the RD&E Unit, and its successor autonomous orga-
nization would be audited by the Government's Intervencion General de la
Administracion del Estado, in accordance with appropriate auditing principles,
consistently applied.
Procurement (see Annex III)
54.       Procurement of equipment and machinery would be through interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guidelines for
Procurement", with a preference of up to 15 percent for domestic suppliers,
except for items costing US$100,000 or less; and proprietary, limited, or long
lead time items critical to the timely completion of sub-projects, which, sub-
ject to approval by the Bank, would be procured through international shopping.
No specific estimate of the value of equipment to be procured through interna-
tional shopping can be made but it is not expected to be a substantial fraction
of the total. Technical services will be obtained through recruitment from
industry, universities, research agencies and consulting firms, both within
and outside Spain, as appropriate.
Disbursement
55.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed on the basis of
48 percent of expenditures for equipment, machinery and technical services,
which represents the estimated foreign exchange component. The schedule of
disbursements will be dependent upon timing of selection and approval of sub-
projects, but it is estimated that disbursements will be completed by the end
of 1982.
Benefits and Risks
56.       The proposed project is innovative and unique for Bank lending.
While it would not be appropriate for direct replication in many countries it
is regarded as particularly suitable for Spain with its already developed
industrial capacity and large pool of skilled workers. For research programs
such as those to be undertaken in this project, it is not possible to calculate
either financial or economic rates of return. Nevertheless, the project is
expected to yield substantial non-quantifiable benefits. The program would
initiate a systematic effort to develop new products and processes leading to
commercial exploitation where none previously existed. It would create an
institutional organization and procedures for controlling and directing re-
search, which could and should be perpetual, as part of the Government's in-
dustrial development policy. By encouraging the participation of the private
sector it would promote the undertaking of RD&E activities as a means of
developing and maintaining a competitive position in foreign and domestic
markets. The level and complexity of Spain's industrial structure is such
that a project aimed at improving its capabilities to undertake indigenous
technological development appears timely and appropriate with good chances of
success. However, it has to be recognized that all research programs carry



- 14 -
substantial elements of risk but the degree and timing of success can be
substantially advanced by good program management, intelligent and well con-
sidered project selection and good cooperation by and with the industrial
sector. The proposed project has a good chance of becoming self-sustaining
in eight years but inadequate funding by Government, inadequate supervision
or lack of enthusiasm could prolong this period and substantially increase
the risks. For this reason the Bank would undertake intensive supervisory
activity which would be augmented by consultants as needed.
57.       The project, being the first of its kind for the Bank, is expected
to provide experience that will yield lessons for a number of developing coun-
tries concerned about developing their indigenous RD&E capabilities and their
ever growing technological dependence on the industrially advanced nations.
The benefits that the project is expected to generate over time--both from
the point of view of its deliberate orientation towards the development and
engineering end of industrial research and in actual product development--
could give encouragement to other countries to adopt similar strategies in
their RD&E efforts and introduce an important new element in technology
transfers among nations.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
58.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Spain and the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the above loan, are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
59.       Special conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan are:
(i) the RD&E Unit has been established (paras 41 and 42); and
(ii) the Managing Director of the RD&E Unit has been appointed
(para 47), in consultation with the Bank.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan 768 Agricultural Research: US$12.7 million Loan of June 28, 1971;
Effective Date: November 1, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977.
Initially, changes in the leadership of the executing agency (INIA)
and its internal reorganization delayed adequate planning and implementation
of the project although foreign research experts were employed and a fellowship
training program commenced. Following the appointment of a new President of
INIA in early 1974 coupled with the provision of adequate funding substantial
progress was made in 1974 and 1975. As a result of the recession and the
political transition project implementation was again seriously hampered in
1976 by the lack of adequate funding and two changes in the Presidency of
INIA as well as ministerial changes in the Ministry of Agriculture. Adequate
funding for 1977 has now been provided, the supervising consultants have been
re-engaged for a further year and good progress on the research programs may
be expected. The original Closing Date of June 30, 1976 was extended to
December 31, 1977.
Loan 884 Second Ports: US$50 million Loan of March 27, 1973; Effective
Date: August 13, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Civil works and organizational changes are now proceeding satisfac-
torily, however technical problems encountered during early stages of construc-
tion are likely to result in project completion being delayed by about 2 years,
to the end of 1979. Substantial cost overruns have so far been met from in-
ternally generated funds which have been augmented by substantial tariff
increases.
Traffic has fallen over the last two years, partly as a result of
the world-wide recession and particularly from a change in bunkering patterns
following the re-opening of the Suez Canal. This fall in traffic, coupled
with the inability of the Ports Authorities to fully reflect through tariff
increases the effects of the serious inflation over the last two years, has
resulted in rate of return ratios falling below those targetted for the
period.
The Bank is currently reviewing with the Ports Authorities and
the Government a possible revision of the project which would be expected
to reflect the changes in traffic patterns and improve financial performance.
Loan 1141 Second Livestock: US$33.0 million Loan of July 16, 1975; Effective
Date: December 15, 1975; Closing Date: October 1, 1980.
Effectiveness was delayed two months due to administrative problems
but satisfactory progress has been made since that time. Staffing to accept-
able strength has been accomplished and farmer interest has been somewhat
better than expected mainly because of the satisfactory results of the First
Livetock Project. The project is expected to develop satisfactorily without
serious slippage.

Estimated              Rate of disbursements will necessarily be dependent upon
Disbursement:         the selection and implementation of sub-projects.   It is
anticipated that disbursements would be approximately as
follows in US$ millions, on a calendar year basis:
1977    1978    1979     1980    1981    1982
Annual       1.00    3.50    5.50    3.50    3.50     1.00
Cumulative   1.00    4.50   10.00   13.50   17.00    18.00
Procurement:           For equipment and materials, international competitive
bidding, with up to a 15 percent preference for domestic
suppliers, will be required except for items and packages
costing less than $100,000 or for proprietary or long
lead time items critical to the timely completion of cer-
tain projects. These items will be procured through
international shopping and are not expected to be a
substantial percentage of the total.
Rate of Return:        The nature of the project precludes the calculation
of financial or economic rates of return.
