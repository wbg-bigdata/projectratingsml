MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A POPULATION AND AIDS CONTROL PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed dcvelopmc.nt credit to
the Republic of Chad for SDR 13.9 million, the equivalent of US$20.4 million, on standard IDA ierms with a
maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for population and AIDS control. The Government would
corntribute US$1.3 million and local communities US$1.0 million equivalent. KfW (Germany) and UNFPA
respectively are providing parallel financing of about US$4.4 million and US$0.1 million.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world, with GNP per capita of
US$210 in 1993. Life expectancy at birth is estimated at 47 years (compared to 52 years for SSA), and the infant
mortality rate is about 122 per 1,000 live births. The principal causes of mortality and morbidity are infectious
and parasitic diseases (including most of the tropical diseases), pregnancy-related conditions, and malnutrition.
AIDS is increasing rapidly, with the number of cases having practically doubled each year from 1986 to 1992.
Chad's population, which stood at roughly 3.0 million in 1960, has more than doubled in the past thirty years and
was reported by the first population census in April 1993 to be 6.8 million. At present, the average annual growth
rate is 2.5% (3% for SSA). Although the estimated total fertility rate (TFR) in Chad (5.7 live births per woman)
is very high by world standards, it is among the lowest in the region where the average is 6.6. The prevalence of
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) is very high and the partly resultant prevalence of sterility may explain the
country's lower fertility. Improved health and socio-economic conditions are likely to exert upward pressure on
the fertility rate in the short-run, a concern which underscores the importance of a strong family planning effort.
3.    The Government's commitment to addressing population issues is expressed in a July 1994 law on the
Declaration of Population Policy (DPP), which spells out the Government's priorities and strategies in population
and family planning (FP), and by the legalization of the practice of contraception. Public recognition of the
importance of the AIDS epidemic is recent and so are programs to control the spread of the disease. The second
Medium-Term Plan (MTP 2) (1995-1999) for AIDS control, officially approved in August 1994, is heavily
weighted towards prevention activities. However, a major impediment to implementation of population and AIDS
control activities is the limited institutional capability for planning, management and coordination.
4.    Project Objectives. The project would assist the Government in implementing its long-term strategy in
population and FP and its second Medium-Term Plan for AIDS control. Its overall objectives are to advance the
onset of fertility decline by increasing the use of modem methods of contraception, and slow the spread of HIV
infection by promoting behavioral change.
5.    Project Description. The project builds on and complemnents the support to be provided under the IDA-
financed Health and Safe Motherhood project approved in June 1994, particularly in the delivery of FP services
and the treatment of STDs as part of the basic package of services, and the training of health personnel. It would
support policies and investments designed to: (a) reinforce the national capacity to implement the population
policy (US$8.0 million) by: (i) strengthening the national capacity to undertake population-related activities; (ii)
implementing a community awareness program and dissemination of the population policy; and (iii) supporting
population-related research; (b) strengthen the national capacity to contain the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs
(US$6.6 million) by: (i) institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Public Health; and (ii) supporting
epidemiological, operational, and socio-economic research; (c) put in place a social marketing program for the
promotion of condoms (US$7.1 million); and (d) promote the participation of the private sector and NGOs in
population, FP, and HIV/AIDS/STD programs through a social fund (FOSAP) (US$5.5 million). The project
would finance specialist services and training, minor rehabilitation of ficilities as necessary, equipment, vehicles,
materials, contraceptives, and eligible incremental operating costs.

6.    Project Implementation. All projcct activities would bc managcd and implcmcntcd by existing units or
directorates of the Ministry of Public licalth (MOPH) and the Ministry of Plan and Coopcration (MOPC), and by
an NGO, thc Chadian Association for Family Welfare (ASTBEF). The population policy component would be
managed by the Division of Population at the MOPC; the componcnt on strcngthcning national capacity to
contain the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs would bc the responsibility of the National AIDS Control Program
(PNLS) at the MOPH; the social marketing component would be managed and implemcntcd by the AS 1 BEF and
an international firm specialized in social marketing, under the supervision of the MOPC and, for tcchnical
aspects, the MOPH; and the FOSAP would be managed by the project coordination team (PCT) under thc dircct
supervision of the Directorate Gencral of the MOPC.  Day-to-day coordination of project activitics.
administrative and financial matters, monitoring and evaluation, as well as interagency coordination, would be the
responsibility of the PCT, located in MOPC and reporting directly to the Director General. Thc projcct will
strcngthen the national capacity by providing specialist support and training. A project implementation manual
was discussed during appraisal and would be finalized for the project launch workshop.
7.    Project Sustainability. At the end of the project, a national capacity to continue population and AIDS
control activities vould be in plaee. Given the very limited physical expansion envisaged under the project, the
expected incremental recurrent costs to be generated directly by project investments would be minimal. The only
real addition to the physical infrastructure would be the rehabilitation of a building to house the Division of
Population and one to house the condom social marketing program. Similarly, minimal incrcmcntal salaries to be
paid by Government are expected as most staff involved in project implementation are already on the MOPH and
MOPC payrolls. The incremental recurrent costs generated by the activities supported under this project should
be compared with the long-term costs of not launching a population program and an AIDS control program.
Without the financing provided by the proposed project, a much more serious sustainability problem would
emerge in terms of: (i) costs for increases in social services to cater to a faster growing population; (ii) costs for
caring for additional AIDS and STD patients; and (iii) costs for caring for children of additional AIDS victims.
8.    Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. 'The proposed project would be the Bank's second
free-standing intervention in the health and population sectors in Chad (the Health and Safe Motherhood project
became effective February 24, 1995) and the first in the specific area of HIV/AIDS control. Several lessons have,
however; been learned from the Social Action Development Project (PADS, FY 1990) which has a health
component that aims at inproving health and living conditions of disadvantaged groups in N'djamena and the
Tandjile prefecture. One lesson pertains to the insufficient capacity of the concemed Government agencies,
including the PCT, to carry out ambitious projects. In the case of the PADS, weak managerial capacity led to
serious start-up delays. The proposed project would address such deficiencies by: (a) putting training and
capacity building at the center of all components; (b) using NGOs and the private sector; and (c) planning
frequent supervision. Another lesson is that policy reforms need to be addressed up fiont, prior to negotiations.
In the case of the proposed project, the Government has (i) developed and adopted by law a Declaration of
Population Policy and a detailed plan of action; (ii) legalized the practice of contraception and the import of
contraceptive products; and (iii) adopted the MTP 2 for AIDS control.
9.    Lessons from Project Experience Elsewhere. In addition to the lessons mentioned above, Bank-financed
population and AIDS control projects implemented worldwide offer several lessons. In population, the most
important lessons learned are that official commitment is needed, and that efforts in FP should be accompanied by
efforts to reduce the demand for children through reducing child mortality and increasing women's eaming
capacity. With respect to AIDS/STD, the following lessons are significant: (i) large-scale condom promotion and
marketing have resulted in large increases in condom use; (ii) NGOs can play a significant role in AIDS/STD
control efforts particularly in reaching high-risk groups; and (iii) the impact of AIDS control interventions is
higher in early stages of the epidemic than at a later stage. All these lessons have to a large extent guided the
development of the proposed project.
10.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's Countra Assistance Straicgy (CAS) for Chad was presented to
the Executive Directors on May 25. 1993 in the Memorandum of the President for the Fifth Education Project. It



3
supports thc objcctives of alleviating poverty and improving thc prospects for long-tcrm growth and emphasizcs
human rcsourccs devclopmcnt. The proposed project is a central part of this CAS and is fully consistent withi thc
critcria for activitics to bc supported. It addresscs both basic povcrtv issucs and thc prospects for long-term lper
capita income growth. It docs this through cfforts to control AIDS, which affccts cspcciallv the most produictivc
agc-groups and brings widespread miscry to famnilics (particularly orphans), and throtugh attnmpts to slow
population growth.
I.   Agreed Actions. Agrccmcnt has bccn rcached on the following: (a) thc Division of Population would
rcmain fully staffcd at all times and kcy staff would not bc rcplaced without IDA's approval; (b) the govcrnmcnt
would opcratc the PCT under tcrms of refcrcncc (including staffing) acccptabic to IDA; (c) it would maintain in
the budget of the ministrics involved in AIDS control, a scparatc budgetary item for such activitics; and (d) it
would makc available to the bcncficiarics portions of thc amount allocated to the FOSAP. in accordance with
agrcemcnts cntcrcd into betwcen the FOSAP and the beneficiaries oni terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA;
and IDA would revicw and approvc any grant in cxcess of CFAF 30 million bcforc the contract is signcd. As
conditions of effiectiveness, the Govemmcnt would: (a) sign a contract with the CERPOD for TA in population,
(b) recruit a long-tcrm tcchnical assistant in cpidemiology and programn managemcnt;.(c) sign an agrerecmnt with
the ASTBEF, and with a firm specialized in social marketing that will bc providing tcchnical assistancc; (d)
ensure that the bid documents for the first two years (one year for contraccptives) of the project arc prepared; (c)
establish the PCT, with the projcct coordinator and the key professionals in post, and the accounting and financial
management system in place; and (f) cmploy an independent auditor.
12.   Poverty Category.    Thc project is included in the Program of Targeted Intcrventions since projcct
beneficiaries will includc a larger proportion of poor peoplc than does the country's population as a wholc. In
particular, it will assist AIDS familics and orphans, and will cnsure that poor women have access to
contraccption. Through FOSAP. poor communities will receive grants and technical assistancc through NGOs to
implement AIDS control and population activities.
13.   Environmental Aspects. The environrncntal category assigned to this project is "C".
14.   Program Objective Categories. Thc project responds to the country's strategies and Bank program
objectives categorics of povcrty rcduction and human resource development. It will contributc to AIDS
prevention. Because of its focus on population and family planning, it has a WID dimension.
15.   Participatory Approach. Throughout project preparation, discussions were held with MOPC and MOPH
technical staff to agrce on priorities within the population and health scctors. A participatorv planning proccss,
including personnel from different ministrics, NGOs, and communities, was used to develop both the population
policy and the second Medium-Term Plan for AIDS control. This process helped to accelerate their dcvelopmcnt
and official approval, and to engender understanding and commitment on issues relating to population and AIDS
in general, and women in particular. During project implementation. sub-projects financed by FOSAP will bc
developed and implemented by beneficiary communities.
16.   Project Benefits. By assisting the Government in implernenting its population policy, the projcct would
help increase community awareness of the legitimacy of FP activities. It wvould facilitate the integration of FP
into the public health system and encourage the private sector to work in this area. Thc overall population
program, including efforts supported by the IDA-financed Health and Safe Motherhood project and NGOs, is
expected to increase the contraceptive prevalence rate from less thar. 2% to about 10% by the year 2000. The
wider practice of FP would have a particularly beneficial effect on the health of women and children. The project
would help slow the spread of the HIV infection and alleviate the burden of HIV/AIDS on about 12,000 AIDS
patients, 21,000 families, 45,000 orphans, and the nation. The project would have significant returns in terms of
years of healthy life saved and would hold down the indirect economic cost of AIDS - the losses of productivity
and human capital, which threaten the long-term economic development of Chad. The project would also hclp
prevent the transmission of STDs. which is one of the most effective strategies to inhibit the spread of HIV. By
the end of the project, effective multi-scctoral IEC activities and the social marketing of condoms are expected to



4
proclucc behavioral changcs among the 415,000 scxually-activc persons at high risk and roducc or prcvent the
transmission of HIV infcction and STDs. By contributing to rcducing thc numbcr of infcctions transmittod to
womcn, thc project would hclp reducc ncnnatal infcction.
17.   Risks. Thcre are thrcc main risks. First, the implcmentation of the population policy may bc hampered
by thc unstablc political conditions in the country. This risk would be addrcssed by closely monitoring the
implemcntation of this policy through supervision of the project as well as through the Bank's general dialogue
with the Governnent. Second, the Government's weak capacity may result in poor implementation. This risk
would bc addrcssed through the strengthening of the public institutions involved in project implementation, and
through the use of NGOs as well as the private sector. Third, the Governme it's chronic financial constraints may
affect counterpart funding, particularly for salary payments. This risk would be mitigated through the successful
implementation of the Economic Recovcry Program and carcful monitoring of performance indicators.
18,   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement
of the Association and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

CHAD: Portfolio Implementation
1.    Chad is in the midst of a political transition. with clections cxpcctcd to takc placc ovcr the coming
months. In .ianuary 1994, in concert with othcr mcmbers of thc CFA franc zone, Chad devalued its currcncy by
50 percent in foreign exchange tenns. The supply responsc to thc devaluation has becn strong but Chad failcd to
mcet thc targets set forth in thc Stand-by arrangements with the IMF, particularly as concerns revenuc colicction.
Progress was made, howcvcr, in the second half of 1994 and revisod targets werc cstablishcd.
2     Overall performance of the Chad portfolio improved from FY93 to FY94. During the FY93 ARPP, Chad
wvas singled out for having three problem projccts (30%) out of tcn opcrations. During FY94, correctivc actions
Nverc takcn to address this issue; as a rcsult, the portfolio has no problem projects. Disbursement perfomiance has
remained steady from FY93 to the present, and a disbursement mission is schedulcd in FY95 to provide assistance
in Special Account documentation.
3.    The major constraints on1 project implementation in Chad arc: (a) the low levcl of intemal rcvenucs,
resulting in Governnent inability to provide counterpart funds and pay civil servant salaries on time; and (b) weak
institutional capacity and lack of skills of some project directors, particularly regarding procurement procedures,
accounting systems and auditing.
4.     Procurement processes and capacity improved in FY94. The Country Procuremcnt Assessment Review
carried out in Chad in December 1992 led to concrete actions to develop a local procurement capacity. It also
helped to identify and put in place the following actions which will have the effect of strcngthening the
Government capacity to control and to tax imports: (a) petroleum import surveillance was contracted out to a
private firm; (b) a two-year in-service training program in procurement, financed by IDA, is offered to local staff;
and (c) an implementation unit was established in the Ministry of Plan and Cooperation to assist Bank-financed
operations in the areas of procurement, accounting and auditing and to monitor more carefully the timely
availability of counterpart funds. IDA played an important rolc in helping the Government to design the needed
corrective measures to improve implementation capacity.
