Main Policy Areas            This Development policy Loan supports the Government's efforts to
                             address economic and social consequences o f the current global financial
                             crisis and economic slowdown while improving resilience of the Jordanian
                             economy to adverse shocks. Four complementary policy areas are
                             supported: (i) reducing fiscal vulnerability by broadening the tax base and
                             enhancing effectiveness o f government expenditures; (ii) strengthening the
                             financial sector by further enhancing regulation and supervision and
                             improving access to finance; (iii)improving the business climate to
                             encourage more private sector investment; and (iv) facilitating access o f
                             vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally sustainable social
                             protection system.

Key Outcome Indicators (by    1) Reduced fiscal imbalances and enhanced macroeconomic stability
November 20 10)                    Reduced tax exemptions that distort relative prices and create
                                   inequity, and a new framework for scrutinizing introduction of hture
                                   preferential rates.
                                   Reduced expenditure pressures, improved fiscal sustainability and
                                   increased flexibility of the budget by reinstituting fiscal consolidation
                                  plan, including completion o f subsidy reform.
                                  New budget calendar, facilitating the first Cabinet discussion in the
                                   first quarter of 2010 on budget performance, strategies and priorities
                                  based on first such study.
                             2) Strengthened financial sector and broadened access to finance
                                  All banks run first pilot stress test. Stress testing process becomes a
                                  part of individual banks' risk management process and Central Bank
                                  systemic evaluation; prospective capital needs become more
                                  measurable.
                                  Plan for more comprehensive consolidated supervision adopted by
                                  Central Bank which will provide a more comprehensive and systemic
                                  view of potential threats and risks to the banking sector.

                                 bureau.
                                 Risk monitoring enhanced by lowering reporting threshold to the
                                 public credit registry thereby increasing borrowers covered by 40,000,
                                 representing 14 percent o f bank borrowers.

                            which seek to "(i)  strengthen the investment environment and build human
                            resources for a value-added, skill-intensive and knowledge-basedeconomy;
                            (ii)reform social protection and expand inclusion; and (iii)restructure
                            public expenditures and support public sector reform." By consolidating the
                            Bank's long standing technical dialogue and assistance to support the key
                            reforms in these areas, this operation i s also expected to inform the
                            preparation of the new CAS (scheduled for FY2011).
Risks and Risk Mitigation   The Program faces two main risks:

                            Economic risks. The global crisis continue to unfold, exposing Jordan's
                            economic prospects to risks driving from further weakening o f global, and
                            particularly Gulf, economy. At the source o f these risks are still high level
                            o f public debt, large twin deficits and heavy dependence on remittances and
                            foreign aid. W h i l e the risk o f external instability arising from the capital
                            account i s mitigated by the fact that external debt i s owed predominantly to
                            official creditors, and reserves provide comfortable liquidity cover relative to
                            short-term liabilities, heavy reliance on regional liquidity to sustain
                            financing inflows translate into high external vulnerability. Exports,
                                                         ..
                                                         11
               including tourism, and remittances could slow more sharply than
               anticipated as a result o f the regional economic slowdown, while tighter
               liquidity in the Gulf countries may lead to lower capital inflows and grants.
               Lower economic activity and lower international prices, on the other hand,
               checks the growth of current account imbalance. If financing further dries,
               the contraction of real GDP and the increase in unemployment would be
               more pronounced over the coming year than anticipated. This would strain
               the banks and the corporate sector and would also create difficulties for the
               achievement o f the fiscal targets. The risk of gradual economic recovery
               has been incorporated into the macroeconomic projections. The risk o f
               external financing difficulties i s mitigated by largely prudent policies
               supporting a measured external adjustment and adequate liquidity, Jordan's
               relative attractiveness to Arab investors, and significant donor support,
               including bilateral support from the U S and Gulf states.

                Weakening political support. A prolonged and deeper domestic slowdown
               could add to social pressures, lead to backsliding on resumption o f more
               disciplined approach to expenditure management policies, and adversely
               impact the health o f the financial sector. In 2008 a resumption o f
               expansionary fiscal policy in response to price shocks has led to adverse
               public debt dynamics and increased reliance on donor grants. This risk i s
               addressed by the fact that key measures, such as control over excessive tax
               exemptions and capital spending, and elimination o f remaining key
               subsidies, which will reduce fiscal pressures, are already being
               implemented as prior actions. Furthermore, the Governments medium-term
               fiscal framework which establishes the expenditure ceilings for 2010
               budget and indicative ceilings for the next two years, constrains the room
               for excessive spending without matching revenues. The risks in the banking
               system have been further addressed through an active CBJ approach to
               identify risks and strengthen the supervisory powers. Similarly, major risks
               related to the implementation of specific program components are not
               foreseen because the reforms are mature, supported by technical assistance
               and widely discussed within the Government and with key stakeholders and
               donors.

I.         INTRODUCTION

1.       This document describes a Development Policy Loan for US$300 million to Jordan. The
operation supports the Government's efforts to address economic and social consequences o f the current
global financial crisis and economic slowdown while improving resilience of the Jordanian economy to
adverse shocks. Specifically, it supports policy measures which (i) reduce fiscal vulnerability by
broadening the tax base and enhancing effectiveness o f government expenditures; (ii) strengthen the
financial sector by further enhancing regulation and supervision and improving access to finance; (iii)
improve the business climate to encourage more private sector investment; and (iv) facilitate access o f
vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally sustainable social protection system.

2.       Envisaged in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for 2006-10, the preparation o f this
DPL in FYlO has been triggered by the second order effects o f the global economic downturn on
Jordan's economy. The Government has requested the Bank to prepare the DPL as part o f i t s rapid
response actions aimed at supporting the real sector of the economy, including by diversifying i t s
financing instruments (which over the recent years relied mostly on domestic market), while
consolidatingthe long standing cooperation with the World Bank in advancing the key structural reforms
that has been at the core o f implementation o f the CAS. The impacts o f the unfolding global and regional
economic slowdown, the Government response and proposed World Bank support are described in the
following sections.

11.              BACKGROUND
           COUNTRY

3.      Jordan i s a lower middle income country with a population o f 5.9 million and a per-capita
GNI o f US$3,310 (2008). Jordan's natural resources are potash and phosphate-agricultural land i s
limited and water i s considerably scarce. The population i s urbanized at around 80 percent and i s one o f
the youngest among lower-middle income countries, with 38 percent under the age o f 14. Fertility rate
(3.6 percent) i s higher than Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and lower middle income countries
average.' Jordan's economy i s dominated by services, which account for over 70 percent o f GDP and
more than 75 percent of jobs. Jordanian policy makers' ambition i s using the demographic opportunity o f
a very young population to move toward a high-wage, knowledge-based economy. This transformation
would require policies that encourage business creation and remove the distortions that presently distract
entrepreneurs from focusing on Jordan's comparative advantage: its relatively well-educated citizens; it
also requires emphasizing the quality o f education-areas of priority in Jordan's National Agenda.

4.         Notwithstanding the difficult regional political environment and the lack o f resources,
Jordan has achieved above-average development outcomes within its income group. Underpinned by
i t s strong trade links with the region, Jordan's economy has shown strong performance since 2000 with
annual real GDP growth averaging 7.5 percent and per capita GDP more than doubling. Growth has been
broad based, led by manufacturing, construction, real estate and services sectors. Inflation remained low

     World Development Indicators (2008). Fertility rates for MENA and lower middle income countries are 2.85
percent and 2.28 percent in 2007, respectively.

(except for the surge in 2008 driven by international oil and food prices) and although the external deficit
widened, sizable FDI inflows enabled a steady and sizable increase in international reserves. This can be
credited to sound development policies, recent substantial capital inflows and to one o f the world's
highest levels of unilateral transfers (workers' remittances and public grants, amounting to about 20-25
percent of GDP). However, Jordan i s vulnerable to adverse external events, such as the recent increase in
world oil and food prices and the global recession as well as deterioration in external flows.

5.      Over the last decade, Jordan has been very active in reforming its economy. It has a sound
record as one of the lead reformer in MENA, particularly in liberalizing private investment regime,
opening the trade regime, establishing modem regulation and institutions for the private sector
development and privatization, strengthening public financial management system and building human
resources through a comprehensive education sector reform. The process of structural reforms has been
accompanied by a painful fiscal consolidation that has steadily reduced government debt from above 200
percent of GDP in the early 1990s, to 62.4 percent by the end of 2008. While the price shocks in 2008
(which coincided with the elimination of oil subsidies) led to divergence from the fiscal consolidation
efforts with wide-ranging compensation policy, the Government's continues to emphasize economic
reforms and macro-fiscal sustainability. Sustained progress in the implementation of fiscal consolidation
program, with increased emphasis on strengthening effectiveness of the expenditure management, and
structural reforms are key to maintaining good economic performance and achieving faster decline in
poverty in the period ahead.

6.       Achieving sustained growth and reducing unemployment and poverty are the main
development challenges in Jordan. Commensurate with strong growth in investments and GDP, labor
force growth in Jordan has been strong.* However, unemployment among nationals declined slowly (from
 14.5 percent during 2000-05 to 12.7 percent in 2008). Among the key factors explaining the simultaneous
existence of high job growth with persistent unemployment among Jordanians are mismatches between
the high expectations of the unemployed and the prevailin low wages of available jobs, and between the
                                                                B
location o f the new jobs created and those of unemployed. While employment among those who actively
seek work need to be supported through increased focus on skills, addressing voluntary unemployment
requires aligning policies with the Jordan's aspiration for becoming a knowledge economy. Such
alignment requires removing legal and regulatory distortions and encouraging creation of new businesses,
while increasing incentives to accept existing jobs by ensuring social protection reforms to increase
incentives to work and by removing disincentives caused by civil service hiring practices.

7.       While high, the poverty rate has been declining in recent years. The 2006 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey estimated that 13 percent of the Jordanian population i s living below the
national poverty line.4 Contrary to public perception, poverty in Jordan dropped between 2002 and 2006,5
but deep pockets of poverty persist-poverty in Jordan i s shallow with large share of the population
consuming at levels close to the national poverty line. The decline in poverty i s explained by an increase
in real expenditure especially among the poorest resulting from a robust GDP growth and increasing
remittances since 2000.6 In contrast, income levels remained stagnant over the same period. The
Government has been providing cash transfers and various subsidies as part of its safety net, which


     *From 2000 to 2005, the Jordanian economy created between 24,000 and 44,000 additional jobs per year which
increased to 60,000-70,000 by 2008.

       Keeping the poverty line level o f consumption fixed in real terms, adjusting for changes in prices over time

reached i t s peak in 2008 at the time of international price shocks. Focusing on mechanisms that are
systematically included in the budget, such as revising the National Aid Fund targeting, i s more effective
in protecting the poor and vulnerable. Similarly, given that the labor income i s the most important source
of income for Jordanian households, fostering growth in poor areas and promoting broad-based growth,
higher employment and productivity are important in attaining strong poverty reduction.

8.       Addressing these development challenges are the key priorities of the Government. In 2005,
a Steering Committee (including representatives from the government, civil society, private sector,
Parliament, and media) completed the National Agenda-an ambitious development agenda to transform
Jordan into a modern knowledge-based economy with higher value added, increased productivity,
employment and welfare through sustained and broadly-shared growth, while achieving fiscal
sustainability. Modernization o f the country's economic, institutional and political infrastructure,
reforming education, improving the business environment, and attacking deep poverty are at the core of
this Strategy. The current Government's program presented to Parliament in December 2007 runs along
the same lines of the National Agenda.

 10.     Inflation rose in line with world oil and food prices in 2008. Average increase in the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) remained in the range of 3.4-6.2 percent in 2004-07 but shot up to 14.9
percent in 2008 (combination o f a 15.4 percent y-0-y increase in the first nine months o f the year and of a
13.4 percent y-0-y increase in the last quarter). With imports to GDP ratio averaging to 9 1 percent during
this period, a large portion of inflation was imported. The relative slowdown in the CPI starting in the last

       There has, however, been a marked slowdown in the performance of manufacturing in 2008 even before the
onset o f the global recession. This mainly reflected the decline in the exports o f garments from the Qualified
Industrial Zones (QIZ) to the USA-main destination for QIZ exports. And it i s only partially related to the impact
o f the global recession on the demand from the U S market; even prior to the crisis, QIZs were unable to compete
with similar industrial zones that are developing activities particularly in Egypt.

quarter of 2008 reflects the sharp reversal in the trend of international fuel and food prices, which have
brought import costs down.

 11,     Gradual elimination of the oil subsidy significantly helped Jordan's fiscal position in recent
years. Starting in the early nineties, Government of Jordan fixed the retail price of oil and implemented a
(budgetary) subsidy system in an effort to insulate the domestic market from fluctuations in international
oil prices. This subsidy scheme increasingly weighted on the government's budget with the disruption of
the preferential oil supply arrangement with Iraq (on a partly grant, partly preferential rate basis) in 2003
and the subsequent rapid rise in international oil prices. In response, the Government took a decision to
gradually eliminate the subsidy scheme as part of i t s fiscal consolidation plan under the National Agenda:
oil prices increased by almost 270 percent between July 2005 and April 2006 and the oil price subsidy
eliminated as of February 2008. However, the associated loss in real income for low and middle income
groups particularly in 2008 has largely been compensated by variety o f measures, including tax
reductions and exemptions, various subsidieshransfers and substantial public sector pay increase.

12.      The improving fiscal position was reversed in 2008. After falling from 14.0 percent of GDP to
6.6 percent between 2003 and 2006, the budget deficit excluding grants has increased to 9.4 percent in
2008 on the back of higher expenditures (see Table 1.). The major source of the increase was the
compensation package that the Government phased in through 2008 in order to mitigate for the sharp
increase in domestic prices driven by the world prices. Additional foreign grants (reaching US$l,Ol4
billion compared to US$485 million in 2007), helped to attenuate the strong rise in pre-grant fiscal
deficits: foreign grants as a share of GDP increased from 2.8 percent in 2007 to 4.8 percent in 2008,
financing just about half of the overall deficit in 2008.

 13.      The public debt declined significantly through 2008. The mostly concessional nature of
foreign lending and the fiscal consolidation efforts helped Jordan remain largely on track to reach the
provision of the public debt law which capped the total (net) public debt ratio at 80 percent by 2007
(which was further reduced to 60 percent in 2009). In 2008, Jordan signed a debt buyback operation at an
1 1.O percent discount rate with 10 Paris Club member states. The operation covered up to US$2.4 billion
o f foreign debt and the effective debt buyback after discount amounted to US$2.1 billion. It was financed
by privatization proceeds (estimated at US$1.2 billion) and land sale. As a result, public debt declined
from 74 percent o f GDP in 2007 (below the cap) to 62 percent o f GDP in 2008. At the same time, the

                                                           4
share o f external debt in total debt declined t o 39 percent (59 percent at end-2007), while the share o f
domestic debt increased to 6 1 percent (4 1 percent at end-2007).

14.      External current account deficit deteriorated and became volatile after 2004. Jordan has
maintained current account positions that were broadly balanced from mid- 1990s through 2004. The
deterioration in 2004-2005 and 2008 reflected an exceptionally rapid increase in imports, as the saving-
investment balance shifted.' In 2008, the current account deficit was 11.3 percent o f GDP, down from a
peak o f 17.3 percent in 2007. It continued to increase in the first three quarters o f 2008, reflecting a
significant increase (38.4 percent) in imports o f goods and non-financial services, before falling sharply in
the last quarter o f the year, mainly due to the decline in the commodities prices following the international
financial turmoil. The FDI financed about three quarters o f the deficit, with remainder mostly coming
from errors and omissions, possibly remittances from Iraqi migrants and overseas Jordanians. This
allowed for a rise in official reserves which stood at 8.6 billion dollars by end 2008 (up from US$7.5
billion in 2007).

 15.      Monetary policy has generally maintained the exchange rate peg. The Jordanian dinar i s
pegged to the U dollar. After having depreciated by about 16.5 percent by end-2007 from i t s peak in
                  S
2002, the real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 8.4 percent in 2008. This reflected increase in oil
and food prices which pushed up the inflation differential relative to trading partners, as well as
                    S
strengthening o f U dollar against other currencies. Facing inflationary pressures, resulting from rising
commodity prices and the excess liquidity in the system (money supply increased by 17.3 percent in
2008), the Central Bank o f Jordan (CBJ) increased i t s interest rates gradually during the first nine months
o f 2008; there was also an increase in the mandatory reserves requirements from 8 percent to 10 percent
o f total deposits. During this period, dollarization rate declined steadily to 21.7 percent (27 percent in
December 2007).' According to the IMF staff assessment, real effective exchange rate i s broadly in line
with medium-term fundamentals. Over the recent years o f a rapid increase in private sector credit growth,
the CBJ has also strengthened the Bank regulation and supervision. Banks have been required to
strengthen their risk management systems as well, and stricter provisioning rules have been introduced.

B.       Macroeconomic Outlook in the Context o f the Global Turmoil

 16.    The global economic slowdown has created several medium-term challenges for Jordan. The
three most important o f these are declining global o i l prices (which have a positive impact on trade deficit
but a negative impact on transfers and capital account), declining private capital flows to developing
countries (which were a major source o f growth for Jordan in the recent past), and sharply lower global
and regional growth outlook (which affect exports and remittances). Reflecting these effects, domestic
economic performance has worsened since September 2008. The collapse in commodity prices favored a
reduction in expenditures through a decline in budgetary subsides but also generated a drop in tax
revenues because o f lower prices and lower economic activity. Also, while improving the current account
balance, the decline in international prices and more broadly global turmoil has reduced foreign inflows,
and negatively affected growth.




     * Jordan faced three major shifts in i t s external environment: (i) exceptional provision and subsequent sharp
                                                                         the
cut- o f f in grants to the government following the onset o f the Iraq war; (ii) rise in global oil and food prices; and
                                                                                 a
(iii) surge in foreign investment inflows. The simultaneous impact o f these external developments, coupled with
     a
strong economic growth, contributed to the large current account deficits in 2005 and 2007.
     9
       This decline i s mainly explained by the widening o f the spread between interest rates on JD denominated
deposits and international interest rates. Indeed, with the decline in the Libor, the spread between time deposits in JD
and Libor-3 months increased from 58 basis points (bpt) in December 2007 to 240 bpt in September 2008.

                                                              5
17.      Economic activity i s expected to slow significantly in 2009. In the first quarter of 2009 (Ql-
09), GDP i s reported to have increased by 3.2 percent, well below the trend. According to the Bank's
Quick Response Survey (QRS),'' about two thirds of firms expect the same or a lower level of sales,
exports, investment, and employment in 2009 compared to 2008. This situation contrasts with the one
observed in the last quarter of 2008 when no firm expected to reduce labor force-a signal of the
unfolding impact of the global/regional economic slowdown. As most of the surveyed f i r m s (64 percent
of them) export to the MENA region and to a smaller extent to Europe, it i s not surprising to see a
majority of firms expecting a decline-or at best stabilization-of their activity. According to preliminary
figures, foreign direct investment (FDI) to Jordan declined by 80 percent" in the first quarter of 2009 (y-
o-y)--data available for the past ten years show a strong sensitivity of FDI, exports of goods to the Arab
countries, exports of services and remittancesto the change in the international oil prices.

 18.    Possible repatriation of Jordanian migrant workers may put further upward pressure on
the unemployment rate. Available data so far shows that unemployment rate i s on the rise, reaching 13.0
percent in Q2-09 (y-0-y), up from 12.1 percent in Q1-09 and 12.5 percent in Q2-08. With the Gulf
remaining the main destination for Jordan's emigrant labor, the economic slowdown there along with
domestic economic slowdown could push Jordan's unemployment rate further up in 2009. Decline of
remittances has been limited in the first half o f 2009 (4.4 percent y-0-y), suggesting that repatriation of
emigrant workers has been limited too; however there i s a possibility for the repatriation to accelerate in
the second half of 2009, putting additional upward pressure on the unemployment rate if realized.

 19.      Preliminary data confirm the adverse impact o f the economic slowdown on Jordan's fiscal
balances. While income tax revenues increased by 30.0 percent in the first seven months of 2009 (y-0-y),
a l l other revenues are on the decline, with particularly large decline in land registration fees (39.0
percent). The overall increase in domestic revenues during this period i s limited to 2.2 percent (down
from 14.6 percent for the same period last year) while increase in expenditures i s at 14.4 percent, despite
some savings from budgetary subsidies due to sharp decline in international commodity prices. This
implies significant divergence from the initial 2009 budget law, prepared before the onset of global
economic crisis, which projected a 15.3 percent increase in revenues and a 13.3 percent increase in
expenditures. The result i s higher overall budget deficit, excluding grants, which i s expected at 9.3
percent of GDP in 2009. Among the actions the Government i s considering to contain the overall budget
deficit at this level i s reduction in this year's capital expenditures by 1.9 percent of GDP (from 9.1 to 7.2
percent), thus bringing the implementation rate of the capital budget close to the recent years average of
about 85 percent, and public consumption by 1.2 percent o f GDP (from 18.0 to 16.8 percent).'*

20.     On the other hand, some macroeconomic variables such as inflation, the current account
balance and reserves, are expected to maintain a favorable trend in 2009 relative to 2008. This i s
largely because of the effects of much lower oil prices and lower imports (which declined by 23.1



       IO
        The survey covered 61 private companies in several major sectors o f the Jordanian economy: food,
chemicals, metal industry, tourism, garments and IT/electronics during April 2009. Total employment was 27,113
workers in this sample. The survey followed up on a similar exercise conducted in November 2008.
     11
        This large decline partly reflects the inclusion o f a large one-time sale o f Aqaba port land in the
corresponding FDI figures for the Q1-08. Excluding this transaction, the FDI in the Q1-09 declined by 56 percent
(Y-0-J).
        The Government o f Jordan has revised the budget for 2009, taking stock o f net effect o f the drop in revenues,
and subsidies and transfers, and envisaging (i)a less ambitious increase in public investment (to offset potential
negative impact o f the global economic slowdown on growth); and (ii) containment o f public consumption.
Domestic revenues in 2009 are declining because o f the slowdown in activity; decline in prices o f goods (decline in
sales tax) and decline in FDI (drop in real estate registration fees).

percentI3 in the first half o f 2009 compared to the same period in 2008) partially associated with lower
investments. As a result, the trade-in-goods deficit during this period was significantly lower at U S 3 . 4
billion compared to US$5.0 billion in the same period last year. Foreign exchange reserves o f the CBJ
increased to US$10.3 billion in July 2009 (equivalent to about 10.9 months o f imports), from US$8.6
billion in December 2008, partly reflecting the continuation o f the conversion from foreign currency
denominated deposits to Jordanian Dinar (JD) denominated deposits.

21.      Jordanian banks' financial indicators were not immediately affected by the first round
impact o f the global financial turmoil but may begin to reflect the impact o f the economic
downturn. Limited integration with global financial markets buffered Jordan from the recent turmoil
preventing immediate and direct losses among banks. The aggregate nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio
increased only slightly (from 4.1 percent in 2007 to 4.2 percent at year end 2008). However, the second
round effects o f the financial turmoil have the potential to develop into more discernable trends. Banks'
credit portfolios are characterized as being relatively highly concentrated and the real estate, construction,
and foreign trade sectors are vulnerable to weaker market activity. Banks with substantial exposures to
these sectors as well as to markets abroad through their foreign operations are likely to be more adversely
affected by the slowdown. Some deterioration in loan quality i s expected by both the authorities and the
banks as economic activity slows, the long period o f high credit growth reverses, and property prices
soften. Currently, banks are monitoring exposures closely and re-pricing credits and/or cutting credit lines
to customers facing increased risks, especially in the real estate and foreign trade sectors.
Notwithstanding a moderate decline in the banking system's capital adequacy ratio in 2008 due to
implementation o f Basle I1 standards, the aggregate ratio remains well above the 12 percent requirement.
Although current indicators are stable, additional measures being taken by the CBJ are needed to identify,
anticipate and manage risks.

22.       The Central Bank o f Jordan has taken pre-emptive steps to maintain confidence and
support the domestic money market.I4 These measures include a full guarantee o f all bank deposits by
the Government until end-2009, scaling back operations to soak up liquidity, reducing policy interest rate
(so far by 150 bps) and reducing the reserve requirements (from 10 percent in October, 2008 to 7 percent
o f total deposits). Currently, liquidity position o f the banking system remains comfortable after bank
deposits edged down slightly in October 2008.15 The share o f dinar deposits has continued to increase
since then, reflecting the interest rate differential between dinar and dollar denominated deposits. At the
same time, loan to deposit ratios have fallen from 72 percent in 2008 to 69 percent in the first seven
months o f 2009. Growth in credit to the private sector has slowed sharply, falling by 1.2 percent between
August 2008 and July 2009 reversing the annual growth o f 14 - 28 percent in each o f the last four years.
Bank lending to industry has been particularly affected (down by 7.5 percent in July 2009). While large
well-known enterprises report renewed access to bank credit, banks are s t i l l very cautious about lending
to small and medium enterprises given the lack o f information and limited options for collateral.I6

23.    The ongoing global economic turmoil and uncertain outlook pose exceptional challenges to
Jordan's short- to medium-term economic prospects. Jordan's strong regional ties provided a cushion


     l3 The decline in the imports o f goods i s the combination of a 16.4 percent decline in prices and o f an 8 percent
decrease in volumes.
     14
        CBJ followed a relatively tight monetary policy in the previous period in an attempt to dampen inflationary
pressures.
     15
        While demand for interbank loans diminished as excess liquidity in the banking system surged, some
reluctance by banks to lend to one another may also be playing a role.
     16
        Microenterprises though seem to be able to access increasing donor and government funds through non-bank
microcredit institutions. The largest micro-lender, the Government-supported Development and Employment Fund,
recorded a yearly increase o f 28 percent in lending volume up to the first quarter o f 2009.

                                                             7
in i t s exposure to global economic slowdown-given the relatively limited impact of the financial turmoil
in MENA. Still the economic outlook i s characterized by a high level of uncertainty, related to the
evolution of world commodity prices, the level of foreign current and capital inflows as well as the
regional security situation. Jordan has, however, demonstrated strong resilience to dramatic external
economic and political shocks since 2003, maintaining focus on comprehensive development strategy.
The Government's increasing emphasis on cushioning the population from the impact of the price shocks
and economic downturn since 2008 led to a divergence from the fiscal consolidation program and erosion
of fiscal gains achieved over the previous years. Looking forward, however, the ongoing efforts to re-
institute the fiscal discipline and address the economic slowdown by accelerating the key structural
reforms which have been under preparation over the last several years combined with selected short-term
policy actions aimed at addressing immediate adverse impact of the crisis, augur well for a continuation
of the more cautious economic policies of the recent years.

24.     Bank staff projections on the medium-term (2010-2012) take into account the importance of
external economic environment for Jordan's economic prospects. The base-case scenario takes
account of: (i) the projected evolution of oil prices (and hence regional oil wealth) and their impact on
foreign inflows and growth; (ii) projected growth worldwide and i t s impact on Jordan's exports; the
                                  the
emerging favorable development of export activities to Iraq; and the slowdown in garments exports to the
USA; (iii) Government's 2010 fiscal policy mix which envisages adoption of new sales and income
            the
tax legislation, rationalization of tax exemptions, the containment of public consumption, including
through liberalization of prices for barley and cooking gas oil, and rationalization of budgetary social
safety net spending (mostly compensation spending). I7Also, the projections take into account the
feedback from the Bank's QRS on the expectation o f the real sector representatives for sales, investments
and exports over the near term.

25.     The above assumptions project a gradual economic recovery over the medium-term.
Following an estimated decline in real GDP growth to 3.2 percent in 2009, the growth i s projected to
recover gradually in 2010 (at about 4 percent), reaching to 5.0 percent in 2012, at par with the long term
growth potential o f Jordan's economy but remaining well below the pre-shock average growth
performance (see Table 2). Among the drivers of this gradual recovery are the expected (i) gradual
recovery in regional oil wealth,lg with the projected gradual increase in oil prices positively affecting
Jordan's economy through exports, income transfers, remittances, FDIs, and portfolio investments; this
positive impact will largely compensate for the negative impact of the rise in oil prices on Jordan's
external balance; and (ii)
                         positive response of domestic private investment to relatively relaxed monetary
policy (given higher reserves and lower inflation), and ongoing improvements in the business
environment.

26.       The twin-deficits are expected to improve during the projection period. The current account
deficit i s expected to reach a low 9.7 percent of GDP in 2010, before settling at around 11.0 percent of
GDP through 2012 with the gradual increase in imports. Reflecting the Government plan of containing
key expenditures pressures and increasing the emphasis on effectiveness of expenditure management,
fiscal balance gradually improves over the projection period. Accordingly, primary deficit after grants i s
projected to decline from 4.0 percent of GDP in 2009 to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2012, which help stabilize
the debt to GDP ratio in 20 10-20 11 and put it in a downward path thereafter.



     " For the years 2010-2012, income tax revenues w i l l most probably decline due to the cut in tax rates projected
in the new tax law currently debated in the Parliament.
         The long term growth for Jordan over the period 1992-2008 has been 4.8 percent on average per year.
     l 9 Reflecting projected gradual increase in oil prices from average o f US$60 per barrel in 2009 to US$80 per
barrel in 2012.

27.      The base case described above i s subject to risks emanating from the uncertain global
environment. If o i l prices remain at around US$50 per barrel range, then lower regional demand o f
goods, services and labor, and lower regional transfers and capital inflows will have a modest
contribution to economic growth.20 A lower demand from Iraq for Jordan's exports and a lower
worldwide growth will have similar effects as lower o i l price. Under these circumstances, Jordan will




     ,
benefit from the positive effect o f lower o i l prices on inflation and on current account deficit. However,

    *'  Data fi-om the recent past show that a one percent change in oil prices could generate as high as a 2.0 percent
change in FDI, a 0.4 percent change in remittances, a 0.88 percent change in exports to Arab Countries and a 0.7
percent change in the exports o f services. For example an oil price o f US$SO/barrel in 2010-1 1 could lead to
inflation lower by 0.5 percent and to a 2-3 percentage point improvement in the current account deficit. However,
growth could decline by 0.5 percentage points and primary deficit rise by 0.7 percentage points.


                                                                       9
policy-makers may be tempted to rely more on fiscal policies and on debt financing of public deficits in
order to promote growth. On the contrary, if oil prices rapidly increase, and if Iraqi and international
demand for Jordan's goods and services remain strong, then the role of exogenous factors in growth
dynamic will prevail as well experienced in 2008. Fiscal and monetary policy will then have to focus on
containing inflationary pressures, growing current account deficit, and pressures for faster improvement
in living standards (commensurate with overall economic performance) through higher public spending.

28.      On the financing side, Jordan has recently shifted towards lesser reliance on domestic
borrowing. The context of global financial crisis and the significant increase in the financing
requirement2'has recently led the Government to revise i t s sources of fiscal deficit financing particularly
for 2009. Given the comfortable liquidity in the market in recent years o f high external inflows, the
Government opted for increasing net financing from domestic sources, which led to a major shift in the
composition of the public debt even before the external debt buyback operation in 2008 (see para.13).
However, in a context where liquidity in the market might be less abundant than in the past few years, and
where public financing requirements are higher, that financing option may significantly suck up liquidity
otherwise available for the private sector and other economic agents. That in turn could adversely affect
private investment and undermine growth and job creation. While the Government i s seeking to finance a
portion of i t s now higher financing requirements from external borrowing (including through the
proposed DPL) or higher access to foreign grants, it remains cautious about resorting to a sovereign
exposure to the international market.

C.         Debt Sustainability

29.      Jordan's public debt can be kept on a sustainable trajectory provided fiscal adjustment
continues. Public debt has been significantly reduced in 2008 with debt to GDP ratio dropping by over 10
percentage points to 62.4 percent, thanks to the Paris Club debt buyback as well as rapid nominal GDP
growth, The IMF staff assessment based on the original 2009 budget22        suggested that in the absence of
fiscal consolidation measures, the ratio i s likely to increase by about one percentage point per year over
the medium term (through 2014). Since then the Government took actions to contain expenditures in
2009 especially in the face o f much weaker-than-envisaged revenue performance in the original 2009
                                                                     20 10-20 12 envisages further significant
budget. The Government's Medium-Term Fiscal F r a m e ~ o r k ~ ~ f o r
reduction in public expenditures in terms of GDP at 1.4 percentage points compared to 2009 (see Table
2,). A stronger discipline in fiscal policy-keeping debt increases below the rate of growth of the
economy-will, in turn, put the debt ratio on a downward path by 2012. Overall, the Jordanian policy
makers' successful policies in improving fiscal and debt sustainability over the past decade makes the
achievement of their envisaged fiscal adjustment over the medium term plausible: for instance, the debt to
GDP ratio was successfully brought down by about 40 percent between 1999 and 2008, as the primary
deficit (including grants) was, on average, in balance during this period. While Jordan's debt outlook
remains vulnerable to adverse shocks, they are unlikely to put the debt on unsustainable trajectory unless
their magnitude i s unusually large. In this regard, the Bank and Fund analyses implies that if fiscal
adjustment i s implemented, such events as a one-half standard deviation shock to real growth, interest
rates, and the primary balance, or a combined one-fourth standard deviation shock, or a 30 percent real
exchange rate depreciation, are unlikely to bring the debt to GDP ratio above i t s 2007 level (74.2 percent)


      '' The financing requirement after grants i s estimated to reach 6.6 percent o f GDP in 2009 (or U S $ l . 5 billion),
significantly up from 2005-07 levels o f around 3.7-4.7 percent o f GDP (or US$550-800 million) and 2008 level o f
4.6 percent o f GDP (or US$979 million).

IV.                REFORM
        THEGOVERNMENT   PROGRAM

A.      Long-Term Vision

30.     Becoming a modern knowledge-based economy with higher value added, increased
productivity and employment i s at the core o f Jordan's long-term development vision. This vision
implies a bold modernization of the country's economic, institutional and political infrastructure, based
on the enhancement o f its human capital, and the amelioration of poverty. The Government acknowledges
that this requires a modern and efficient administration, and a more open and participatory policy.

B.      National Agenda and Government Policies

31.     Jordan's National Agenda was prepared in 2005 by a Steering Committee including
representatives from the government, civil society, private sector, Parliament, and media. The
National Agenda i s an ambitious 10-year development agenda to transform Jordan from a lower-middle
income country into a modem knowledge-based economy with higher value added, increased productivity
and employment, and improved quality of l i f e for Jordanians. The National Agenda distinguished three
consecutive phases: the first phase (2007-20 12) i s focusing primarily on improving the business
environment, creating employment opportunities, and building the skills needed for the knowledge
economy. The second phase (2013-2017) focuses on strengthening the industrial base, and preparing the
ground for the development o f high value-added sectors in the knowledge economy. The final phase
(20 18-onward) would complete Jordan's transformation to a world class competitor in the global
knowledge economy.

32.      The first phase o f the National Agenda includes multi-ranging development areas. Among
these areas are political development and inclusion, justice and legislation, investment development,
financial services and fiscal reform, employment support and vocational training, social welfare,
education, scientific research and innovation, and infrastructure upgrade. The Government programs
approved since then, including the executive program for Kuluna a1 urdun (2007-2009)-"We are all
Jordan" initiative-have been consistent with the goals o f the National Agenda, and further defined and
complemented i t s socio-economic objectives by setting up short- to medium-term initiatives aiming also
to increase participation and inclusiveness.

33.     The National Agenda includes a number of key performance indicators to measure its
implementation. The Agenda was complemented by broad strategies, policies and quantifiable objectives
in an integrated way, providing general guideline actions for the policy makers. The Government has
made progress on the macro-economic and social quantitative indicators included in the Agenda,
particularly in the areas of growth, budgetary subsidy polices and public debt, poverty, and education. To
address the impact o f the recent exogenous shocks, the GoJ has taken a set o f actions that had not been
envisaged during the preparation o f the Agenda. While the ongoing global economic crisis may render
some o f the targets difficult to reach by their due dates, the Government remains firmly committed to
reaching the National Agenda's development objectives and the strategies envisaged are being
implemented.




                                                     11
Fiscal Adjustment and Reforms

34.      The National Agenda calls for radical fiscal reforms to improve budget performance and
increase Government efficiency. The Agenda puts its emphasis on addressing expenditure pressures in
order to control the budget deficit especially to address vulnerabilities due to the expected decline in
foreign grants and increase in international o i l prices over time. Among the key reforms to improve the
budget performance are (i)  phasing out oils subsidies by 2007 along with eliminating other subsidies; (ii)
pension reform; (iii)reform o f civil service pay and grading system to improve productivity; (iv)
accelerating privatization and channeling the proceeds to facilitate the fiscal reforms; (v) tax reform to
simplify the procedures, ensure fairness, broaden the tax base and improve collection performance; and
(vi) modernization o f customs administration. As discussed throughout this document, the Government
has made a considerable progress in implementing and or initiating most o f these critical reforms, which
will strengthen fiscal management. Areas where the progress has been limited are reforms in pay and
grading system and overall human resources management to streamline government. Yet progress has
been registered within several ministries/public institutions using different tools such as the King
Abdullah I1 Center for Excellence, which plays an innovative role in promoting excellence in service
delivery by public sector institutions.

35.     The National Agenda focuses on a comprehensive public sector reform program and e-
government program for improving Government efficiency. An area with steady implementation
progress i s the public financial management reform. A number o f PFM reforms are currently underway,
following the introduction o f a three-year medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) with the 2008
budget, a new Chart o f Accounts, revision to the budget planning timetable to allow for the Budget to be
promulgated prior to the start o f new fiscal year and revision o f Jordan's Organic Budget Law. These
reforms include installation o f a Government Financial Management Information System, GFMIS
(expected to be piloted in six ministries by January 1, 2010), completion o f a Treasury Single Account
(MoF i s in the process of finalizing the bidding process with the banking sector), further development o f
the MTEF, and implementation o f steps towards the introduction of some results-orientation in the budget
process. When it becomes operational, the GFMIS will significantly improve data reliability and will
enable more timely and accurate centralized accounts reconciliation.

36.      A recent review o f progress with public expenditure management and the MTEF reforms
that were initiated in 2007 noted that despite significant progress in a short time, Jordan i s still at
an early stage o f these reforms. While MTEF roll out had been constrained'by the wider demands o f a
comprehensive PFM reform agenda, the macroeconomic and fiscal analysis underlying the Budget had
been significantly enhanced, the budget planning horizon had been extended to three years, improved
procedures for setting ministry resource ceilings had been adopted, performance indicators have been
introduced into the budget documentation, and new policy-led budgeting procedures were being piloted in
some ministries such as Health Care and Education. However, the experience under the MTEF has shown
that linkages between planning and budgeting needs to be further strengthened. Capacity limitations both
in central and line ministries have also been highlighted. Implementation of the expenditure planning
reforms has also been overly focused on project spending with limited attention given to improving the
effectiveness and efficiency o f recurrent spending. In order to handle these challenges, the Government
plans to put a stronger focus on the efficiency and impact o f public spending in budget analysis and
preparation, including through strengthening the strategic phase o f the MTEF/budget preparation.

Financial Sector Reforms

37.     The National Agenda puts its emphasis on strengthening governance and structure of
financial services, facilitating funding to start-ups and SMEs, and developing the insurance sector.


                                                      12
Through these reform, policy-makers aim at consolidating the substantial progress that the banking and
insurance sectors made in updating the organizational frameworks and control procedures governing
company operations as well as in introducing new financial instruments, and increasing competition and
focus on retail banking.

38.     The CBJ has continued to carry forward the strengthening agenda through further
development o f bank supervision and ongoing updating and issuance o f a number of regulations.
The updating and refining o f bank regulations over the last few years has brought Jordan more closely in
line with international standards. Some o f the areas addressed through this effort include, inter alia:
prompt corrective action, licensing, asset and liability management o f foreign currency, business
continuity, asset classification, corporate governance, internal control, and liquidity requirements for
Islamic banks.

39.     The CBJ has required banks to comply with the Basel I1 Capital Accord, effective 2008.
CBJ continues to,require much more focus by banks on risk identification, anticipation, and management
processes. Preparation o f an annual Financial Stability Report has begun, increasing the transparency o f
banking sector condition as w e l l as policy making.

40.      The CBJ has also taken a number o f measures to promote financial sector stability in the
wake of the global financial and economic crisis. Banks are being encouraged to build capital buffers,
both through increased profit retention and through capital injections by shareholders, and the CBJ
continues i t s efforts to oversee the implementation o f the Basel I 1 capital accord. The staffing o f the
supervisory function has recently expanded with the employment o f fifteen new staff and a new on-site
supervisory manual i s in the final stages o f preparation. Global consolidated supervision i s being pursued.
The CBJ recently conducted examinations o f selected bank operations o f Jordanian banks abroad and
intends to continue this program o f supervisory visits in the coming year. In this context, it has increased
contacts with foreign supervisory agencies and has established memorandums o f understanding (MOU)
with thirteen foreign financial sector regulators and two domestic regulators. Furthermore, plans for a
formal consolidated supervisory approach are being prepared which will include, inter alia, continuation
o f supervisory reviews o f Jordanian banking operations abroad, periodic supervisory monitoring o f
consolidated banking entities, and further interaction with other supervisor^.^^ A review o f the existing
legal framework to determine if it provides adequate scope to execute comprehensive consolidated
supervision will also be conducted.

41.     Currently, the CBJ i s in the process of enhancing the implementation o f stress testing of
banks and indentifying follow up actions. Going forward, the exercise will be conducted annually and
will be used to assist in identifying and analyzing various forms o f banking risk, to contribute to the
analysis o f capital adequacy under different scenarios, and when necessary, t o identify the possible need
to require remedial actions from banks. Likewise, it will provide banks' and the C B J an additional tool
with which to identify developing systemic trends. In the future, banks will be responsible for conducting
their own "bottom up'' stress tests o n a semi-annual basis using C B J provided parameters as well as their



      24 The supervisors aim at continuing to evaluate the relevant consolidated entities, ensuring ongoing
documentation and updating o f the full range o f relationships banks have with not only downstream subsidiaries and
affiliates, but with other entities which form economic relationships with the bank or are otherwise in a position to
impact the risk profile and capital o f the bank. The supervision effort would include both evaluation of relevant
group-wide business strategies and their impact on the banking entity; group-wide risk management and financial
control processes; effectiveness o f capital (on a solo and consolidated basis); and establishment o f regulatory
reporting (solo and consolidated) for the bank group as a whole and i t s relevant relationships to enumerate more
formalized supervisory strategies for each group based on the above evaluations.

                                                           13
own developed assumptions. The CBJ will review the banks' established assumptions and will expect
banks to address any issues or trends that are highlighted from the exercises.

42.      The CBJ and banking sector are also in the process o f undergoing a complete revamp of
their statistical and regulatory reporting. This i s intended to achieve several goals: (i)upgrade and
automate regulatory reporting so that it feeds into the Early Warning System (EWS); (ii) provide
additional granularity needed to accumulate data series to measure compliance with Base1 11; (iii)       meet
the (standardized) statistical data reporting configurations prescribed by IMF which will allow more
concise reporting o f positions; and (iv) present the monetary and banking statistics on the website (and
elsewhere) with more depth and accuracy (e.g., additional detail will be provided on (aggregate) loan
portfolio breakdown (housing, SME, corporate and the like), capital position, o f f balance sheet info, etc.).
The project i s currently in process with threshold dates set for various achievements during the upcoming
months. The first run pilot test for system-wide reporting i s currently scheduled for the end o f 2009.

43.      The GoJ signaled its commitment to improving access to financial services when it adopted
the National Microfinance Strategy in 2005. This set out a market-oriented vision for microfinance,
with the public sector providing an enabling policy and legal framework, and not directly providing
financial services. The National Agenda emphasizes the importance o f access to financial services for
socio-economic development, in particular for SME development and for the poor and marginalized.
Jordan has one o f the highest rates o f market coverage (46 percent) for microcredit in the region.
Microfinance institutions lend to low income borrowers (average loan balance i s less than one-third of
GDP per capita) and to women, who make up 84 percent of microfinance institution clients. Microfinance
institutions are not allowed to also directly offer savings and payment services, so broader microfinance
access i s much more restricted. The GoJ retains an indirect involvement in the sector as the principal
source of funding for the largest micro-lender, the Development and Employment Fund, which accounts
for 22 percent of the total $29 million microcredit portfolio in Jordan. The GoJ also provides guarantees
to promote SME finance by commercial banks, through the Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation.

44.      M o r e recently the GoJ has initiated wide ranging legal and financial infrastructure reforms
to broaden access to financial services. The CBJ has embarked on lowering the threshold on credit
reporting by banks and thereby so far doubled the number o f borrowers included in the public credit
registry, while improving the timeliness and quality of the reported data. The Ministry o f Industry and
Trade has led the preparation o f a draft law to allow the creation of a private credit bureau, which would
further reduce credit risk by including information on a l l borrowers, by including non-bank lenders such
as financial and leasing companies, and by enabling banks to expand SME and consumer lending safely
using credit rating and scoring techniques. The draft law i s consistent with data privacy and consumer
protection aspects, with written consent by borrowers envisaged for information disclosure. Collateral
constraints to increased access to finance have also been eased alongside credit information deficiencies,
through the 2008 Financial Leasing Law. Further progress would be achieved through a Secured
Transactions Law that would allow the use o f movable assets as collateral and out-of-court collateral
enforcement. This i s consistent with the National Agenda commitment o f "modernizing the law on
mortgaging of immovable properties."

45.      Telecoms and payments innovations show promise for improving access to finance in
Jordan.     The national e-commerce strategy formulated by the Telecommunication Regulatory
Commission identified mobile phones as a promising channel for e-commerce. Jordan has one o f the
highest levels o f mobile phone use in MENA outside o f the GCC, with penetration rates estimated at up
to 80 percent, and high levels o f remittance transfers linked to the large share o f foreign nationals living
in Jordan. There i s interest by leading mobile network companies in Jordan to roll out e-payment and
transfer products, given a clearer legal and regulatory environment for this activity.


                                                       14
Business Environment Reforms

46.      A key element o f the National Agenda i s to make Jordan an attractive location for
knowledge-based private investment in order to support further job creation. This rests on the fact
that the earlier waves of reform initiated in the mid 1990s did not trigger a sufficiently strong private
sector response.25

47.       Past structural reforms liberalized the private investment regime, opened the trade regime
and overhauled customs administration, and established more modern regulation and institutions
for private sector development and privatization. To complement structural reforms, Jordan broadened
its free trade agreements (in the region, with EU and the USA) and engaged in an extensive privatization
program.26 2006, cumulated privatization receipts reached above 13 percent of annual GDP, and above
             By
10,000 new direct and indirect job opportunities were created owing to privatization and opening up the
sectors to private investment^.^^

48.     Despite these significant structural reforms and open access to markets, the private sector
response has not been strong enough to make a stronger impact on unemployment. Among the key
factors behind this outcome i s the persistence of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, red tape, and poor
public service delivery, which increase transaction costs for the private sector. The indicators of Doing
Business from 2004 to 2008 show that Jordan, while performing close to regional averages, i s far from
being top of the class in MENA, and compares less favorably with some of the most dynamic emerging
economies in Asia and Latin America.

49.      I n 2008 the GoJ launched a Public Private Partnership program while broadening and
deepening its investment climate reform process. The GoJ has adopted a more strategic approach to
capital formation, combining efforts to improve the investment climate and attract/encourage private
business investment, which involves promoting Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for selected
infrastructure investments, and reserving the GoJ-only investment for general public goods.

50.      I n parallel, GoJ's efforts to improve business environment gained depth and pace. In 2008,
the GoJ put together a Committee to coordinate and facilitate faster improvement in the business
environment headed by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation. The Committee, which
includes representatives of ministries and agencies concerned, devised a strategy to improve the business
environment in Jordan on the basis of the framework provided by the Doing Business (DB) report, and
key areas of concern underlined by the 2007 Investment Climate Survey. Key areas in the GoJ's plan
include:

   Improving entry and exit regulations to foster Competition. In mid-2008, the GoJ reduced the
   minimum required capital to establish an LLC (from 795 percent of GDP per capita in 2007 to 24
   percent in 2008) to encourage businesses to enter the formal sector. This effort i s now being furthered
   within the upcoming new Companies Law, to abolish both the minimum capital requirements for LLC
   and the requirement for depositing 50 percent of the capital of LLCs in commercial banks. Other
   measures in preparation include expanding facilities for e-payment of registrations fees and taxes,

    expanding the one-stop-shop with specialized offices (municipality office, public notary, chamber o f
    commerce, chamber o f industry, Income and Sales tax office) for company registration and improving
    the bankruptcy and insolvency procedures;
    Improving the tax administration process. All tax forms has been simplified by the GoJ since late
    2008 and an investor's guide to all taxes in Jordan has recently been prepared (April 2009). In early
    2009, an online filing system for Income Tax has become operational and, following a 2008
    amendment of the relevant legislation,28   limited electronic payment facilities have been made available
    through the proprietary I T system o f the Income and Sales Tax Department. While this i s a major
    improvement, the system i s still in its infancy.*' Its slow start i s largely due to technical limitations, a
    relative lack o f confidence by corporate tax payers in the security o f the system and a preference for
    paper receipts. In the coming months, the GoJ plans to significantly improve and expand the system.
    Improving further the working o customs in order to facilitate trade. The introduction o f the
                                      f
    ASYCUDA World System3' and its integration with the Single Window system3' currently operational
    in Aqaba, the Comprehensive Integrated Tariff System (CITS),32     and many other Customs systems
    since April 2009 will increase the efficiency o f the Customs clearance process and therefore greatly
    facilitate trade.
    Improving contract enforcement procedures. Since early 2009, specialized sections (Maritime Law,
    Companies and Commercial Agencies, Intellectual Property, Liquidation and Bankruptcy,
    Documentary Credit and Letter o f Guarantee) have been created in the first court o f Amman which
    handles roughly 80-85 percent of the civil cases (incl. business disputes) in the country. In addition, a
    computerization of case management and an electronic filing system are now being implemented in all
    courts. In the upcoming year, the GoJ expects to create similar specialized sections in the remaining 16
    first instance courts of the country outside Amman. This new system should better facilitate the
    resolution of business disputes once it i s fully operational.

51.     There has also been renewed emphasis on strengthening the framework for investment
development and growth across regions. A new Economic Zones Law has been prepared for discussion
in the upcoming session of the parliament. In order to rationalize the management o f the zones and the
incentives which are provided for investors, this law proposes the establishment o f a single authority that
will merge the tasks o f overseeing the activities o f three existing categories o f zones (development, free
and industrial zones). This new authority will be autonomous, and will have the ability to conduct
management o f the zones and establish other contracts (including contracts related to selling and renting
land). In addition, a new Investment Promotion Law i s being drafted for discussion in the upcoming
session of the Parliament. If approved, it would transform Jordan Investment Board into a pure
investment promotion agency without any kind o f registration activities.


     28 The Ministry o f Information and Communications Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry o f Finance,
amended the Legislation Number 40, in a manner that allows for e-payment transactions to take place. This was
published in the official gazette on March 27,2008.
     29
         In effect, as o f July 2009, out o f the 700 large corporate tax payers registered for online filling o f their income
tax return (Le. which received a username/password combination to access the system), only 10 effectively used the
system to fill their returns.

         A single window system enables international (cross-border) traders to submit regulatory documents at a
single location and/or single entity. The Single Window i s intended to reduce the number o f transactions to a
minimum, reduce error rate, speed up clearance time, and drastically reduce the face-to-face contact between traders
and government agents so as to enhance transparency.

Social Insurance and Social Safe@ Net Reform

52.      Among the key themes of the National Agenda is social welfare which consists o f three
priority areas: (i)public health care, (ii)social security and (iii)poverty alleviation. In public health
care, the main challenges being addressed are developing a cost effective medical insurance system to
cover all Jordanians, reforming health sector policies and improving the institutional framework, and
enhancing the operational efficiency o f the public health care system. In social security, the GoJ
embarked on a reform plan to expand coverage, revise benefits and eligibility criteria, and ensure
financial sustainability o f the Social Security Corporation (SSC). In the poverty alleviation area, the
priorities have been to reduce poverty rates via a series o f strategic and institutional reforms, including
renewal o f the National Aid Fund, providing assistance to the unemployed poor to integrate in the
workforce, increasing penetrationof microfinance services in poor communities, among others.

53.       The social security system of Jordan provides old age, disability and survivors' pensions but
i s not financially sustainable as currently structured. I t covers 36 percent o f the labor force at a cost of
5.7 percent of GDP-among the highest in the region. According to World Bank projections, the pension
system administered by the SSC will face a financial deficit by 2012 and depletion of reserves by 2027.
The conclusions o f different analysis jointly conducted by the World Bank and SSC reaffirmed the urgent
need to introduce reforms to make the system sustainable in the long term. In addition to this, the SSC
needs to substantially increase the scope of the social security programs in areas such as maternity
benefits, unemployment and health insurance.

54.     The SSC has prepared an ambitious reform proposal addressing the most critical issues. I t
includes the following: (i) adjusting pension benefit formulas and eligibility conditions to ensure financial
sustainability and equity; (ii) expanding coverage by extending the mandate to contribute to firms o f less
than five employees; (iii)  introducing savings mechanisms to protect workers against the risk o f income
loss due to unemployment; (iv) introducing maternity benefits to finance maternity leave currently paid
by employers to eliminate a significant disincentive to hire women; and (v) introducing social health
insurance mechanisms.

55.      A major achievement to date in the social insurance reform process i s the approval in June
2009 by the Cabinet o f the new draft Social Security law submitted by the SSC. The law will serve as
basis o f a comprehensive social insurance reform and i s currently being considered by the extraordinary
session o f the parliament. As part o f the reform process, the SSC also developed a comprehensive
program to build institutional capacity with the support o f the World Bank and other partners, including
participation of staff in technical workshops, specialized training courses in different areas o f social
security, local and international conferences, international fora, etc.

56.     The reform o f the social safety net and the renewal of the National Aid Fund i s a key
priority for Government. The objective of the safety net reform i s to improve the operations and
management, coverage o f the targeted poor population, and targeting efficiency and effectiveness o f the
cash assistance extended to the population through the National Aid Fund (NAF).

57.     Overall, Jordan has most of the programs commonly found in a relatively well developed
and diversified social safety net system. Classified into three general categories, these are: (i)  income
support to poor and vulnerable families, implemented by two key institutions, the NAF and the Zakat
Fund (ZF); (ii)                                               s
              social care services to vulnerable groups such a people with disabilities, children, families
and women in distress, and others; and (iii) economic empowerment through skills and asset
development. Total public spending on safety nets i s estimated at more than 1.0 percent o f GDP, with



                                                        17
two-thirds (0.6 percent) spent through the NAF. The total number o f beneficiaries i s estimated at about 8-
 10 percent o f the population, with NAF reaching 4.0 percent o f the population.

58.      Several issues concerning the performance of the safety net programs have emerged, in
particular the NAF. The main issue i s that the poverty impact o f the cash transfers has been found to be
modest: a major segment o f the poor i s not reached (low coverage) and the leakage o f resources to the
non-poor i s substantial. In 2006, only some 20 percent o f people under the threshold for the NAF
assistance received NAF benefits, comprising 14 percent o f the total number o f recipients; and only some
20 percent o f recipients rose above the poverty line as a result o f receiving NAF benefits.33 t i s important
                                                                                                I
to note, however, that NAF i s most likely reaching a larger number o f its target population (such as
certain categories o f the population) within the targeting criteria that it currently applies.

59.      Recently completed studies, including background documents prepared for the National
Agenda, point to several factors behind the relative inefficiency and ineffectiveness o f the NAF.
These include (i) weaknesses in targeting method: NAF uses a combination o f categorical and income
based targeting which are not most suitable for Jordan's economic structure (high level of informality and
seasonality); (ii) an incomplete policy and institutional framework; (iii) overlapping institutional
mandates as well as fragmentation and duplication o f programs; and (iv) weak monitoring mechanisms
and modest use of Management Information System in managing programs. The GoJ i s in the process of
initiating a NAF renewal process which aims at addressing these issues.

v.        BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                                       PROGRAM

A.        Links to the Country Assistance Strategy

60.      The Bank Group assistance program supports the Government's overarching objectives of
poverty reduction and productive jobs creation. The program i s set out in the Country Assistance
Strategy (2006-1 0) that was presented to the Board o f Executive Directors in May 2006. The structure o f
the CAS i s based on four clusters: (i)strengthening the investment environment and building human
resources for a value-added, skill-intensive and knowledge-based economy; (ii)supporting local
development through increased access to services and economic opportunities; (iii) reforming social
protection and expanding inclusion; and (iv) restructuring public expenditures and supporting public
sector reform.

61.     The CAS Progress Report was completed in March, 2009 and has concluded that the four
clusters remain consistent with the governmental priorities and are relevant in guiding the Bank's
future program choices. The CAS envelope included US$540 million in IBRD lending (base case), o f
which $240 million investments, US$lOO million in partial risk guarantees, and US$200 million in
development policy loans. As of now, all the investment operations envisaged in the CAS have been
approved for a total commitment amount o f US$230 million, and US$95 million in guarantee, leaving the
development policy loans with an allocated envelope of US$200 million available in the final year o f the
CAS implementation. The context of the global financial crisis led the Government to be prudent about its
financing needs in 2009 and to request a larger loan amount o f US$300 million. Indeed the Government i s
keen to avoid crowding out the private sector in the domestic market for finances by diversifying its
financing instruments, which over the recent years relied mostly on domestic market.

62.     The CAS PR envisages that two criteria will guide the Bank's engagement in Jordan over
the last year o f the CAS implementation with a view to being able to quickly respond to requests

     33
      This analysis, utilizing the 2006 Jordan HIES, i s based on the households' per capita annual consumption o f
JD396. A similar analysis was carried out using a special survey in 2007 from which similar results emerged.

                                                          18
from the GoJ. These are: (i)   focus on select sectors with the highest contribution to the GoJ's strategic
objectives and in which the Bank can serve as a catalyst for reform; and (ii)focus on addressing
emergency issues, particularly the impact o f the global economic and financial downturn on Jordan's
economy. The proposed DPL i s consistent with this engagement strategy and consolidates the Bank's
long standing technical dialogue and assistance to support the key reforms in growth, macro-fiscal
stability, and social protection policy reforms. The new Country Assistance Strategy (scheduled for
FY2011) i s envisaged to continue Bank support in these key areas o f reform in Jordan as the country
moves to the implementation o f the next stage o f its National Agenda.

B.      Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

63. The Bank and the Fund teams maintain close collaboration. The World Bank-IMF Financial
Sector Assessment Program for Jordan (finalized in March 2009) informed the financial sector
component o f this loan. The other areas of joint work cover ongoing technical assistance to Ministry o f
Finance in developing medium-term debt management strategy, and assessment of progress and way
forward with public financial management reforms. Cooperation also includes the review o f
macroeconomic developments. The Bank has discussed with the IMF about the content o f the DPL
program and will continue to do so in the near future. The Fund will provide the Bank with an
Assessment Letter o f the Government's reforms. Jordan has no formal program with the Fund, though
relations are close. The Fund undertakes two Article I V missions a year and has provided technical
assistance to the CBJ, including through its Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC). This
has covered the budgeting and costing framework, external sector statistics (foreign direct investment
survey, balance o f payments and international investment information, collection and compilation o f
remittances data) and monetary and banking statistics. METAC has also been providing technical
assistance to the Ministry o f Finance in cash management and treasury single account.

64.     The Bank has good collaboration with USAID and European Commission (EC), both of
which have a strong local presence in Jordan. USAID-funded technical assistance for the Government
in reforming the business environment has covered: property registration, a bankruptcy and insolvency
law, the private credit bureau law, and an expansion o f the e-filing regime for tax payments; and in
reforming the fiscal management has covered: comprehensive tax reform, introduction o f result
orientation to the budget, improvement of budget classification and financial management system.
USAID has been coordinating technical assistance support in these areas both with the IFC and the IBRD.
The proposed DPL program i s consistent with the key findings and recommendations under these
technical assistance programs. The Bank has also been collaborating closely with the EC in the
implementation o f technical assistance for the introduction o f the Medium Term Expenditure Framework
process, whereby the EC assistance focuses on sector level budget preparation, particularly on the
education sector. Finally, social insurance i s an area where the International Labor Organization and the
Bank has been providing complementary technical assistance.

C.      Relationship to Other Bank Operations

65.      The proposed DPL complements the Bank's other activities in Jordan which encompass
investment lending, AAA, and technical assistance. Among the investment operations, the proposed
DPL has strong links with the Social Protection Enhancement Project, SPEP, (US$4 million, FY08),
which i s designed to support the implementation o f the NAF renewal plan by improving the management
and operations o f the cash social assistance programs and the access to and quality o f social care services.
In addition, IFC i s extensively involved in the financial sector, focusing on promoting access to finance
by: promoting leasing by strengthening the legislative regime and clarifying the tax treatment of leasing;
supporting the preparation o f the corporate governance code for banks in Jordan; supporting the


                                                       19
microfinance sector; stimulating the housing finance market through an investment in a new mortgage
finance company and advisory services to support new legislation for the sector; and assisting the GoJ in
drafting the new legislation that will regulate the sharing o f credit information. Through its Global Trade
Finance Program, IFC also supported the capacity o f three commercial banks to deliver trade financing
through partial or full guarantees covering payment risks on banks in the emerging markets for trade
related transactions. In addition, a US$50 million IFC equity investment (IFC's largest equity investment
in the banking sector in Jordan) in Capital Bank supports the bank in i t s small and medium enterprise and
housing finance strategy, promoting better corporate governance standards, and helps with future regional
expansion.

D.      Analytical Underpinnings

66.      The proposed DPL i s underpinned by a series of recently completed and ongoing analytical
and advisory tasks, programmatic technical assistance, and projects. The proposed policy actions and
outcomes are founded on a continuous engagement o f the Bank in the four areas covered under the
proposed DPL: fiscal adjustment, financial sector, business environment, and social insurance and safety
nets, with a comprehensive list o f the analytical and advisory activities presented in Table 3.

67.     The ongoing programmatic assistance in public financial management initiated in 2006
 underpinned the need for further fiscal consolidation and more efficient public spending in Jordan.
The joint Bank-GoJ Public Expenditure Review highlighted the importance o f rationalizing levels o f
public expenditure and prioritizing sector resource allocations in order to reflect better the government's
policy priorities. Follow-up policy noteddialogue on the budget reform process and macro/fiscal-
sustainability set the stage for moving from a retrospective analysis o f spending trends to a forward
looking analysis for implementing budget reform with the aim o f integrating planning and budgeting
processes. Since 2007 the Bank has assisted the GoJ with the introduction and implementation o f the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) with emphasis on strengthening the policy orientation o f
the budget planning reforms. The assessment o f the global financial crisis impact, which examined
mechanisms o f transmission o f the financial crisis to the Jordanian private sector and real economy, and
the ongoing study on price shocks and subsidy reforms identified areas o f fiscal vulnerability and
selectively quantified the gains/losses o f compensation policies, confirming the need for fiscal
consolidation to reduce fiscal imbalances and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency o f public
spending.

68.     The investment climate survey, the business environment seminar/dialogue, and IFC's
study on doing business better in Jordan, and technical assistance on licensing and inspection
reform identified and sought to address (in a consultative way) constraints to doing business in Jordan.
The key recommendations included: streamlining regulatory framework (including obtaining licenses and
permits, contract enforcements and the justice system), reforming taxation and tax administration,
providing demand-driven skills training for workers, providing greater opportunities for private
employment agencies to operate in Jordan's labor market, and developing the capacity o f insolvency
administrators. The GoJ has accelerated its efforts to address these issues since last year, which informed
the key DPL measures in streamlining regulatory framework and improving tax administration.

69.      The financial sector assessment program update ( F S A P ) and the Insolvency and Creditor
Rights Report on Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC) completed in 2009 identified
measures needed to improve the transparency o f the banking sector through re-examining regulatory
reporting, dissemination o f information and enhanced analytical capacities. The FSAP observed the need
to continue focusing on risk assessment and risk management systems in the Jordanian banking sector and
recommended the adoption o f an enhanced stress testing exercises as part and parcel to the banking sector


                                                      20
oversight process. I t further encouraged a move to more formalized consolidated supervision. The FSAP
and ROSC also outlined legal and institutional reform actions that have informed the proposed policy
matrix actions for access to finance. Improved sharing o f credit information was highlighted in both, as
well as by the 2003 Financial System Stability Assessment, and the Doing Business analysis. The agreed
policy actions would improve the quality o f credit information and reporting, and provide the legal basis
for a credit bureau to share borrower information.

70.      The ongoing programmatic assistance on social insurance identified key areas o f reforms
and provided the continued assistance to the GoJ. This assistance channeled to: (i)       adjust the pension
benefit formulas and eligibility conditions to ensure financial sustainability and equity; (ii) improve the
administrative capacity o f SSC to perform its tasks and invest its reserves efficiently; (iii)review the
mandate o f the SSC and achieve a more balanced mix between public and private sources of savings for
retirement; (iv) develop an integrated regulatory framework for voluntary private pensions; (v) identify
appropriate mechanisms o f coverage expansion through contributory and non-contributory schemes to
cover the long-term poor; (vi) introduce savings mechanisms to protect workers against the risk o f income
loss due to unemployment; and (vii) improve social health insurance mechanisms in order to increase the
overall efficiency, reduce high costs and better allocate resources of the health system.

71.      The modernization o f social safety net report and the follow-on social protection
enhancement investment project identified the need to modernize and scale up the National Aid
Fund. The reforms identified include: (i) shifting from the current targeting mechanism (category-based)
to a proxy-means tested (PMT) targeting mechanism; (ii) developing monitoring and impact evaluation
mechanisms o f services; and (iii)   coordinating with other social assistance institutions (Le. Zakat) to
better target resources towards at-risk groups, particularly children, youth and the disabled. In addition,
Institutional Financial Management Capacity Assessment report for social sectors pointed to the need for
further enhancement of the financial management and reporting systems of the NAF, which i s being
addressed through the NAF renewal and modernization process.

E.       Lessons Learned

72.     Lessons learned from implementing policy reform based operations in Jordan and
elsewhere highlight that country ownership o f the proposed policies and a clear strategy to move
forward i s key for success. Country ownership i s also emphasized in both the CAS and CAS PR as
being critical for the success o f the Bank's program. As a consequence, the DPL and, more broadly, the
overall dialogue and program o f the Bank in Jordan are well aligned with Government's reform strategy
in the National Agenda and complementary programs.

73.      Strong analytical underpinnings and links to the Bank operations and technical assistance
programs provide foundations for a well-designed and cohesive policy reform based operation. The
key pieces o f analytical and advisory activities shown in Table 3 above contributed not only to the design
o f the proposed DPL, but also helped inform and facilitate the reform efforts of the Government and
supported a fruitful policy dialogue.

74.       Realistic policy reform agenda in terms o f content and risks has also been important factors
that need to be weighed carefully in the preparation o f the operation. Drawing from this, the
proposed DPL focuses on reforms implementation o f which consolidates key set of reforms under the first
phase o f the National Agenda, paving the way for broadening and deepening the reforms under the
Government's comprehensive development strategy. Ensuring the understanding o f and the appropriate
support for reforms through well implemented communication strategy o f the government should be part
o f its overall efforts to maintain the implementation momentum.

VI.               OPERATION
        THEPROPOSED

A.      Operation Description

75.   The proposed operation i s designed to support the implementation o f the Government's
medium-term development program. The overall development objective o f the DPL i s to support the
implementation o f the Government's medium-term development program34 the context of the current
                                                                    in
global financial crisis and economic slowdown. More specifically, the program supports following policy
areas, aiming at strengthening the resilience of the economy to better position Jordan to resume and
sustain high growth while cushioning the impact o f the economic slowdown on the poor and vulnerable
(the next section and Annex I1 show the main policy actions supported by the proposed operation):



     3 4 This i s broadly described by the National Agenda as "stimulate economic development and improve social
welfare and security through reforms revolving around creating a favorable investment environment, fiscal
discipline, justice, accountability, transparency, employment support, economic competitiveness, supporting small
and medium enterprises.. ." National Agenda, Government o f Jordan, (2006-2015), page 4.

                                                         22
      0   Reducing the fiscal vulnerability by broadening tax base, and enhancing effectiveness o f
          government expenditures;
      0   Increasing resilience o f the financial sector by further strengthening regulation and supervision,
          and improving access to credit;
      0   Improving the business climate to encourage more private sector investment;
      0   Facilitating access o f vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally sustainable social
          protection system.

76.      The Bank has maintained a continuous dialogue in the above policy domains and hence has
a high degree o f confidence regarding their strategic importance. Reforms in these integrated policy
areas will not only support macroeconomic stability, at present perceived as the most important business-
enabling issue, and growth, but will also pave the way for advancing Jordan's structural reform agenda
which envisages progressively promoting higher value-added sources o f growth and job creation in
transitioning economic sectors to the knowledge economy. This single tranche DPL operation
consolidates the Bank's long standing technical dialogue and assistance to support the key reforms in
these areas. Further implementation progress o f specific program components over the period ahead are
expected to continue because the reforms are mature, supported by technical assistance and widely
discussed within the Government and with key stakeholders and donors. This operation will inform the
preparation o f the new CAS which will facilitate continuity in the reform dialogue.

B.        Policy Areas

Fiscal Adjustment and Reforms

77.     The main objective of prior actions in this policy area i s to support Government's efforts to
reinstitute the fiscal consolidation plan so as to reduce large fiscal imbalances and to maintain
macroeconomic stability. In pursuit o f this objective, prior actions have focused on broadening the tax
base, and improving efficiency and effectiveness o f the public expenditure policies, including through
enhanced processes for formulation and evaluation of fiscal policies.

Prior Action I: The Cabinet has issued a decision that (i) eliminated tax exemptions without specijk
duration or amount and issued under the Cabinet's authority; (ii) made Cabinet consideration o any new
                                                                                                  f
exemption conditional on an explicit Ji.amework that identij?es the rationale, costs in foregone revenues,
and establishes a speciJied duration: and (iii) clariped that no tax exemptions w i l l be proposed through
non-tax legislation.

         In Jordan the extent o f tax preferences granted by the Cabinet through differential rates and project
     specific exemptions has increased significantly over the past few years and i s currently excessive-the
     total forgone revenues have reached over US$I billion in 2008 (or approximately one-third o f tax
                                                        .2
     revenues), nearly three times as high as their 2005 level. The exemptions are generally granted for
     individual projects and for specific commodities. The greatest revenue loss has been in sales and
     customs taxes. For instance, the existing sales tax legislation contains 240 preferred items, o f which
      128 items were articulated last year by the Cabinet in response to sharp price increase^.^' The
     Government's proposed new draft Sales Tax Law carries forward these preferential rates while
     eliminating the continued occurrence o f this practice for commodities by allowing the Cabinet to
     reduce (but not increase) the extent o f such preferences without going back to Parliament.36           In

     35 A wide set o f transactions are taxed below the standard rate (16 percent) by the use o f four preferential sales
tax rates (exemption, 0, 4, and 8 percent).
     36
        Some o f these exemptions such as for food stuffs, were intended to lower the cost o f consumer goods at a
time when prices were rising rapidly. Others were expected to help industries, such as construction and tourism that

                                                             23
    addition, emphasizing that the preferential tax policies distort relative prices, harm equity and reduce
    revenues, the Government i s in the process o f reviewing all exemptions previously provided by the
    Cabinet that have no limit on their duration or amount, and rationalizing the granting of project
    specific exemptions through much tighter scrutiny o f when they should be provided.

Prior Action 2: The Prime Minister has issued 201 0 Budget Circular including (i) the medium-term fiscal
parameters for 2010-12 with a revised budget for the fiscal year 2009 as a baseline in which 2009public
expenditures, other than subsidies, were reduced by at least 4.0 percentage points o GDP compared to
                                                                                            f
original 2009 budget law; and (io a comprehensive policyJi.amework-including stable wage and salary
expenditures in terms o GDP compared to the fiscal years 2008-09 and termination o remaining
                          f                                                                        f
subsidies for oil derivatives and b a r l e p a n d resulting expenditure ceiling, which translates into a lower
budget deficit before grants by at least 1.Opercentagepoint o GDP in 2010 over 2009.
                                                                  f

         Excessive public expenditures and resulting high budget deficits reduce Jordan's fiscal space and
    increase the country's vulnerability to the risks created by the external shocks as well demonstrated
    since 2008. Some of the expenditures, such as commodity subsidies, were reduced automatically as
    the global economic slowdown put a downward pressure on the global commodity prices in 2009.
    However, these reductions were insufficient to ensure that public finances are on a sustainable
    trajectory. Originally in its 2009 budget law, the government planned to sharply increase capital
    expenditures in order to provide a stimulus to the domestic economy. However, once negative
    implications of the global downturn for the budget revenues were realized and it became clear that the
    balance o f risks was shifting toward putting fiscal deficit in an unsustainable trajectory, the
    government took a bold step o f reducing this year's capital expenditures (to levels more at par with
    those in recent high growth years), thus demonstrating its commitment to continued enhancement o f
    fiscal sustainability.

        While first steps toward resuming fiscal consolidation have been taken in 2009, more needs to be
   done to ensure that Jordan's fiscal position becomes robust in the face of large external uncertainties
   the economy will face in 2010. As capital expenditures are essential for ensuring the longer-term
   economic growth, optimization o f current expenditures also needs to be considered to make sure that
   they neither crowd out capital spending, nor increase the risk o f macroeconomic instability. In 2008,
   the GoJ compensated the loss in real income associated with the doubling of the world price o f oil and
   food (hitting Jordan particularly heavily through high import costs) by a fiscal stimulus from a variety
   o f mitigation measures in which largest single components were the wheat and fodder subsidy and the
   increase in government wages. Based on expected high inflation, 2009 budget also provided a
   significant compensation vis-a-vis inflation for government wages which exceeded the intended
   compensation by the government in the face o f a sharp reversal in inflati~n.~' line with its planned
                                                                                    In
   more cautious fiscal policy approach over the medium-term, the government will put the emphasis on
   protecting the share o f wages and salaries in GDP. In addition, as part of its overall subsidy reform
   program that has been initiated in 2006, the government has eliminated remaining barley subsidies
   which will help in putting Jordan's current expenditures into a more stable path.

were affected by the global crisis. The exemptions that are intended to enhance specific industries are particularly
unlikely to have productive outcomes (the primary beneficiary will be the service providers themselves thereby
distorting relative investment alternatives in Jordan) since they reduce revenues, distort relative prices, and harm
equity with little probability that they stimulate economic activity.
     37 According to the Government projections, the CPI inflation in 2009 i s expected to remain low at around 1.6
percent, much lower than 6.0 percent projected under the 2009 budget program, when the 2009 wage and salary
compensation scheme was introduced. The result i s significant excessive spending o f 0.8 percent o f GDP in 2009.
Based on experience in countries applied it in the past, forward looking compensationsystem (Le. based on expected
inflation), carries a high risk o f creating a wage-price spiral. In addition, it leads to a excessive spending when the
                                                                                            n
inflation projections are subject to high margin o f error.

Prior Action 3: The Ministry o Finance has adopted an enhanced budget calendar to strengthen the
                                f
initial strategic phase o budget preparation, during which budget performance, strategies and priorities
                         f
are reviewed and medium-term spending requirements evaluated. The calendar includes Cabinet level
consultations in the first quarter o each fiscal year on the key parameters and issues underlying the
                                    f
development o the A4TEF based on a Budget Policies and Priorities Paper.
               f

        The current downturn in the economy highlights the importance o f stronger focus on identification o f
   budget policy and priorities and on the efficiency and impact o f public spending-with a more balanced
   approach to improve effectiveness and efficiency o f both capital and recurrent spending. Adoption o f a
   revised budget calendar allowing for establishment o f a practice of cabinet level consultations in the first
   quarter o f each year on the budget policy and priorities-setting out the key issues and parameters against
   which the Budget i s to be prepared-will greatly enhance institutional framework in fiscal-policy making.
   The Ministry o f Finance has set up this process this year, in order to guide the development o f the hture
   MTEFs based on a Budget Policy and Priorities Paper for Cabinet discussion annually over the coming
   period. This i s being complemented by establishment o f a new policy analysis unit in the General
   Budget Department for in-depth budget analysis.

Financial Sector Policies

A. Strengthening o the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework
                  f

78.     The main objective o f this component i s to support the CBJ in its continuing effort to
promote financial sector stability and bank soundness. Prior action focus on the CBJ's efforts to
identify and to respond to existing, perhaps previously unidentified risk through actions to apply more
rigorous risk management, and improve capital adequacy and address systemic trends.

Prior Action 4: The Central Bank o Jordan has completed afirst run o stress testing on the aggregate
                                     f                                f
banking sector balance sheet and has issued guidelines on stress testing to individual banks; first run
stress testing by each individual bank has been completed.

        The recent financial market turbulence and the subsequent global economic slowdown have
    reinforced the need for financial institutions and supervisors alike to possess the necessary tools with
   which to identify and anticipate existing and developing risks and to be able to quantify and react to
   those risks. The CBJ i s in the process o f introducing tools with which to expand analysis o f banking
   sector risks through stress testing selected bank and market variables. This will help banks and the
   CBJ to anticipate the impact o f adverse market movements, identify risks that may not be immediately
   evident, and flag the possible need for corrective actions by banks. Not only will this facilitate bank
   and supervisory response to potential risk, but the process will feed into the requirements o f the
   second pillar o f the Basel I1 Capital Accord for adequate supervisory review processes. The CBJ has
   completed a first run stress test analysis and has issued guidelines to banks that provide directions and
   parameters for their own stress testing, analysis and risk projections. In response to the stress testing,
   the CBJ has also undertaken supervisory follow up to initiate preventative and corrective actions as
   necessary.

 79.    I n parallel, the CBJ i s pursuing consolidated supervisison. One o f the issues brought to light
by the recent global market turmoil was the nature and the extent o f risk taken by expansive and
sometimes remote operations o f financial institutions, some o f which had not received adequate
supervisory attention and scrutiny. To avoid similar risks from accumulating and becoming a threat to
systemic soundness, the CBJ has also initiated a plan for consolidated supervision o f the relevant banks in
the sector and recently undertook onsite inspections o f the foreign operations o f selected domestic


                                                        25
institutions. I t has also prepared concrete plans for additional onsite reviews of selected foreign Jordanian
bank operations in 2010 and has entered into a total of fifteen M U with domestic and foreign
                                                                            O s
regulatory bodies. Dialog with foreign supervisors continues in an effort to receive and process various
sources o f technical and market information through which to oversee the relevant banking groups. The
near-term steps envisaged include establishment of an adequate legal scope to effectively conduct
comprehensive consolidated supervision and expansion o f supervisory strategies for the relevant
institutions to ensure review of the entire consolidated group in which a bank resides, governance
structures, group risk profiles, and central control functions.

B. Access to Finance

80.      This component supports the Government's objective of increasing employment and
reducing poverty through improved access to finance. Improved access to finance for SMEs will
contribute to achieving the National Agenda target of raising SME's contribution to employment in
Jordan to 45 percent in 2017. Bank lending as a transmission mechanism for the economic slowdown i s
                            Ms
amplifying the impact on S E and risks constraining private sector employment and holding back the
ability o f the SME sector to play its part in economic recovery. The prior action for access to finance
build on the Government's program to improve the legal and policy infrastructure for restoring and
expanding access to finance, while strengthening management o f credit risk.

Prior Action 5: Cabinet has approved a draft Credit Bureau Law that makes f i l l borrower credit information
and history available,for both bank and non-bank borrowers, and that gives borrowers the right to verifL their
data.

        This draft law addresses the lack of information on potential borrowers that constrains S E and
                                                                                                 M
   individual lending in Jordan. Banks and non-banks will be able to expand lending using credit bureau
   information, with better management and pricing of credit risk based on a more accurate assessment of
   the likelihood of borrower default.

8 1.     I n addition, the CBJ has reduced the reporting threshold to the public credit registry from
JD30,OOO to JD20,000, thereby doubling the number o f bank borrowers covered. This increases the
CBJ's ability to effectively monitor risk in bank lending, by doubling the borrower coverage to 80,000, or
14 percent of total bank borrowers. This action also provides aggregate portfolio information for banks to
enhance their credit scoring models, and thereby to potentially reduce lending costs and risk. The central
bank's program to continue to lower credit reporting threshold down to JD5,000 for the public credit
registry and to automate bank reporting will amplify these benefits and cover a much greater percentage
of total bank borrowers.

Business Environment Reforms

82.     The objective o f this component is to further improve the business environment in Jordan
through reducing firms' operating costs. Recent analytical            underlines the persistence of serious
regulatory bottlenecks, with regulations continued to be perceived as complicated and costly by firm's
managers. Similarly, tax administration processes remain at the forefront of firm's concerns in Jordan
with an unclear system and the wide discretion given to officials creating a large burden for enterprises to
comply with the tax regime.39 Prior actions under the proposed operation focuses on reducing firm's entry

    38
         Investment Climate Analysis (World Bank 2007); Doing Business (World Bank, various years); Quick
Response Survey (World Bank, November 2008 and April 2009).
    39
       According to the 2007 ICA, the percentage o f firms having been inspected in Jordan the year before the
survey i s among the highest in the region.

                                                       26
costs and improving the exit process; and improving the resolution o f business disputes at the level o f the
judiciary in order to reduce firm's operating costs, allowing more firms to be created with positive impact
 on job creation and employment. These actions are fully in line with the National Agenda objectives and
will help increase the real sector's resilience to the adverse shocks to the economy.

Prior Action 6: The Cabinet has approved a draft Company Law thereby (i) abolishing the minimum capital
requirementsfor limited liability's companies and (ii) eliminating the requirementfor depositing SO percent o
                                                                                                            f
the capital o limited liability's companies in commercial banks.
            f

        The cost o f creating a company remains high in Jordan (in spite o f an improvement in 2008). Cmntly, the
   cost of creating an LLC amounts to 60.4 percent o f GNI per capita and the required minimum capital amounts to
   24.2 percent of GNI per capita. Although much lower than the regional average, these costs are substantial
   compared to advanced economies were they respectively stand at 4.9 and 19.7 percent of GNI per capita.
   Eliminatingthese costs will foster f m ' s entry and thereforejob creation.

Prior Action 7. The Cabinet has approved a draft Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law thereby deJning the
priority order o secured creditors in bankruptcy cases.
                f

       The framework for bankruptcy and insolvency in Jordan i s severely limited by both legislative and
   institutional constraints. Legislatively, the provisions that affect insolvency are scattered across
   numerous acts, without clear coordination. This has resulted in confusion amongst stakeholders on a
   number o f issues, including such essential issues as secured creditor priority in bankruptcy. Moreover,
   there i s no clear legislative set o f tools for restructuring distressed companies in order to sell them as a
   going concern or to preserve enterprise value. Institutionally, there i s a distinct concern amongst
   market participants regarding the lack o f quality o f insolvency administration.40 This negatively
   impacts the conduct o f existing and future bankruptciesAiquidations.The clarification o f the priority
   order o f secured creditors through the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law will provide clarity for
   stakeholders and greatly improve the bankruptcy and insolvency regime in Jordan, hence, allowing for
   easier market exit. Combined with improved entry conditions, this will foster greater competition on
   the market and help remove one o f the major impediments to private sector development in the
   country.

Prior Action 8: The Ministry o Justice has institutedfully operational specialized commercial sections at
                              f
eight courts outside Greater Amman to improve the resolution o business disputes.
                                                               f

        Contract enforcement and the resolution o f business disputes i s a key concern for firms in Jordan.
   Business disputes were mostly being resolved by the First Instance Court o f Amman which handled
   about 80 percent o f the cases. This implied delays and difficulties in enforcing judgments which were
   detrimental to a proper working o f the system as there was no specialization. As a consequence, it
   costed almost a third of the value of a claim and almost 2 years to enforce a contract in Jordan
   according to DB 2009. Under the GoJ plan for enhancing the business environment, specialized
   sections (Maritime Law, Companies and Commercial Agencies, Intellectual Property, Liquidation and
   Bankruptcy, Documentary Credit and Letter of Guarantee) have been created in the first court o f
   Amman since January 2009. However, similar specialized sections were missing in the remaining
   sixteen first instance courts o f the country outside Amman. Having such sections at eight o f the
   remaining courts through a decision o f the Judicial Council will facilitate the resolution o f business
   disputes and contribute to reduce the operating cost o f firms.

83.     I n parallel, the Companies Control Directorate o f the Ministry of Industry and Trade has
expanded the one-stop-shop setting. Currently, the Companies Control Directorate o f the Ministry o f
Industry and Trade has in place a unified form for company registration and also allows for on-line-
registration o f companies, although e-payment o f fees and taxes i s not yet operational. Furthermore, at the
one-stop-shop in its Amman location and four other locations in the country, it provides for services
(municipality, public notary, Chamber o f Commerce, Industry Chamber, Income and Sales Tax
Department) through specific offices in the same building. With this setting, a l l the documentation
required or missing at the time a company i s to be registered can be obtained on the spot and this does not
slow down the entire process. This system o f representative offices was needed in the four other locations
where a one-stop-shop exists in Jordan (Karak, Madaba, Mafraq and Zahar) but where these supporting
services were not available. Having in place representative offices for municipalities and the Income and
Sales Tax Department will considerably help the process o f registration in the other locations, thereby
fostering firm's entry and job creation.

84.      Moreover, the Ministry o f Finance has initiated the implementation o f an online filing
system for general sales tax return and an electronic payment system for corporate income tax and
general sales tax. Since early 2009, an online filing system for Income Tax i s operational and, following
a 2008 amendment o f the relevant legislation, limited electronic payment facilities have been made
available. However, the system i s still in its infancy. Initiating the development o f an additional on-line
filing system for General Sales Tax returns (with completion by mid-2010) and connecting the payment
system to the e-government gateway from the Ministry o f Telecommunications will greatly improve tax
administration for the benefit o f Jordanian firms by contributing to reduction in their operating costs.

Social Insurance and Social Safety Net Reform

A. Social Insurance Reform

85.     This component supports the Government's objective o f improving the long term
sustainability o f the social insurance system while expanding the scope o f the benefits to include
unemployment insurance. To this effect, the regulatory framework o f the SSC will be reformed in the
following areas: (i)old age, disability and survivorship pensions; (ii) work injuries and professional
diseases; (iii)
              unemployment insurance; (iv) maternity benefits; and (v) health insurance.

Prior Action 9: The Cabinet has approved a draft Unemployment Insurance Program, as part o the draft
                                                                                            f
Social Security Law, to provide unemployment insurance benefits to the members o Social Security
                                                                                    f
Corporation which consists o the following: (0 a flexible mechanism o unemployment insurance
                               f                                            f
savings accounts (UISA) financed by contributions o employers and employees: (io provisions allowing
                                                   f
to use the balances o savings accounts or borrow >om accumulated pension rights with limits to be
                      f
determined by regulations; (iio coverage for all Social Security Corporation members after a minimum
vesting period to be defined by regulations

       The unemployment insurance scheme i s a new program that i s being created under the Social
  Insurance Law, which will provide mechanisms to respond to adverse labor market consequences o f
  shocks to the economy, enhancing the structural long term impacts o f the Law. The scheme allows
  workers to insure against unemployment by being able, upon losing a job, to draw on savings
  generated while working (both workers and their employers contribute to workers' individual
  unemployment insurance savings accounts). The scheme thus provides income protection to job losers
  without worsening employment incentives. A simple and low cost mechanism will be set in place to
  finance unemployment benefits through individual accounts, UISA, and the accumulated rights in the
  current pension scheme. The design o f the UISA mechanism allows it to be introduced in a relatively


                                                       28
     short period o f time, making it possible to serve as a response tool to the consequences o f the present
     economic downturn.

B. Social Safety Net Reform

86.      The main objective of this component i s to increase the efficiency and poverty impact of
Jordan's social safety nets through acceleration o f the N A F Renewal Plan. Accelerating the NAF's
renewal plan has become urgent as fiscal constraints and poverty concerns-especially given high
exposure to external shocks-require that the poverty impact, and effectiveness and efficiency o f the
social assistance be maximized. The renewal plan, which has recently started being implemented, consists
of: (i) implementation o f a Management Information System to establish a Database on Poor and
Vulnerable Population; (ii) strengthening NAF technical, administrative and benefit delivery capacity;
and (iii)improving the targeting mechanism by adoption of the proxy-means testing (PMT) targeting
method. The prior action for this component i s as follows:

Prior Action 10: The National Aid Fund has initiated testing o new targeting mechanism that is
                                                                f
envisaged under the NAF Renewal Action Plan, including: (i) improved questionnaire Jnalized; (ii)
database software developed; and (iii) data @om at least 2,000 households out o planned total 6,000
                                                                               f
collected.

         As part o f adoption of the PMT method, the NAF will test the new method on a nationwide
     sample o f 6,000 households, utilizing an improved questionnaire that incorporates adjustments to the
     targeting formula. Once the test has been completed, which includes the development o f the database
     and its population with the data on the households as well a the necessary training and administrative
                                                                   s
     capacity building, the NAF would be in position to expand the new targeting mechanism nationally. If
     successfully implemented, the NAF Renewal Plan i s expected to increase NAF coverage o f the target
     poor population (from the current 20 percent to closer to 70 percent in five years after adoption). It
     will also reduce the error of inclusion from (80 percent to closer to 30 percent).

VII.             IMPLEMENTATION
         OPERATION

A.       Consultations and Distributional Aspects

87.      The DPL supports the Government's development program, which has been consulted with
a broad range o f stakeholders. One o f the key objectives o f the National Agenda i s enhancing public
participation in the decision making process and strengthening the role of the civil society institutions. In
addition to the consultative preparation o f the National Agenda, the GoJ has made use of various
consultation fora to develop reform and reach agreement since the adoption o f the Agenda, which
increases the prospects o f successful reform. For instance, all draft laws in Jordan-including the recent
ones related to the business environment, access to finance, tax regime, SSC law and the like-are being
developed through consultative approach and put on an official government website to receive comments
from the citizen^.^' This systematic approach to a public information and consultation strategy, in turn
allows the GoJ to take into account all points o f views. The recent examples o f other GoJ consultation
efforts are as follows:

                                               n
    4 ' The Government has launched in 2007 a interactive website (www.lob,io). All draft laws and regulations are
posted on this website for public comments prior to discussing them at the Legislative and Opinion Bureau and
forwarding them to Parliament. In addition, the Legislative and Opinion Bureau, while reviewing the draft laws and
regulations, invite government and non-government stakeholders to discuss them and reach consensus on their
content and objectives.


                                                         29
    0   Consultations in the business environment area have been on-going and extensive over the last
        two years. In February 2008, the GoJ organized a two-day conference to develop consensus-
        driven responses to findings from the Bank's June 2007 investment climate report. The
        conference was attended by more than 100 policy makers and private sector representatives.
        Breakout group discussions focused on key issues highlighted in the ICA survey: business start-
        up, contract enforcement and tax administration issues. Detailed feedback on implementing such
        reforms was delivered by the participants and provided the backbone o f the GoJ's current
        strategy. Since then, each agency participating in the Inter-Ministerial Committee in charge o f
        developing the strategy for enhancing the business environment has been receiving feedback from
        the private sector in its own area.
    0   The CBJ consults with banks regarding proposed measures to improve reporting standards and
        managing risk. For example the draft `stress testing' guidelines were sent to banks for feedback
        through the Association of Banks, before they were finalized and issued. The draft private credit
        bureau law includes good practice consumer protection measures, to ensure that individuals
        benefit from increased access to lower cost credit, while at the same time being protected from
        inaccurate data on their records. The Legislative Bureau met with chambers o f commerce and
        private sector committees to consult on the draft credit bureau law.
    0   In the case o f the social insurance reform, the SSC proposals have been developed through
        continuous and regular consultations with a wide range of stakeholders and widely disseminated
        since their inception. This included consultations with union representatives, employer groups,
        and others. The reform program received inputs and approval from the Board o f Directors o f the
        SSC in 2008, which i s a tripartite entity with representation of workers, employers and the
        government. The SSC also regularly publishes on its website information on the reform program
        including the actuarial assessments.
    0   During the preparation of the World Bank supported Social Protection Enhancement Project
        (SPEP), a wealth o f information was gathered through consultations conducted with various
        NGOs, community representatives, NAF beneficiaries, and others. The consultations revealed
        that citizens expected the safety net programs to perform better by inter alia: (i)     better specified
        criteria; (ii) providing NAF assistance in a fair and equitable manner; and (iii)     linking NAF and
        the other cash assistance to training and work. The NAF renewal program also developed options
        for transitional arrangements for current beneficiaries who might not be eligible for assistance
        under the new targeting criteria. I t i s expected that after the completion of the nation-wide testing
        o f the new targeting mechanism, additional consultations with stakeholders will be carried out.

88.      The measures contemplated under the proposed DPL are expected to ensure stability,
support growth, and provide employment opportunities and better protection for the poor and
vulnerable. To the extent that the measures allow economic recovery as the global economic distress
turns around and increase growth in the medium term, employment opportunities should increase and the
poor should benefit. While the DPL includes fiscal adjustment measures, these do not impact the basic
social services at the lower income segments which are protected.

89.      The overall fiscal adjustment measures aim at increasing confidence and investment
funding to the economy while having positive social impact over the medium term. The fiscal policy
dimensions o f the proposed operation are expected to have a positive medium-term social and poverty
impact in a number o f ways. Firstly, rationalization o f inefficient preferential tax rates, which have
created sectoral distortions by altering relative prices and harmed equity while having no tangible impact
on prices or demand will contribute to putting Jordan's fiscal deficits on a downward-sloping path. This
will also help maintain macroeconomic stability which, in turn, has been an essential ingredient o f any
poverty reduction strategy. Secondly, these measures increase the government's fiscal space which i s

                                                        30
crucial for ensuring delivery of pro-poor social services. Thirdly, they remove price distortions and the
resulting deadweight losses in economic activity, thereby promoting economic growth which has been the
key factor in Jordan's poverty reduction over the recent years. Fourthly, rationalization o f tax preferences
will improve investment decisions in Jordan by equalizing both before and after tax rates o f returns on
investments in different industries, which will enhance economic growth as investment i s better directed
to industries and geographic areas yielding higher rates o f return. On the expenditure side, the GoJ puts its
emphasis on eliminating low-efficiency and wasteful spending without impacting basic social services.
Any remaining adverse effects on the poor are expected to be addressed by strengthening o f the country's
social safety nets which i s another component o f this operation.

90.      The measures to enhance financial sector prudential supervision and regulation and
increase access to finance are expected to have an indirect positive impact on poverty reduction. By
reducing the exposure to potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector, the DPL measures help ensure
that growth and the government's program on poverty reduction are sustainable. An expanded credit
registry and credit bureau would open up access to loans for enterprises and people that banks would not
otherwise have considered (including women and lower income borrowers), or who would have had to
pay a higher interest rate. Restarting bank lending for SMEs through improving credit information and
allowing the use of movable assets, would remove constraints to incomes and employment. SMEs are a
principal source o f private sector employment in Jordan. E-payment mechanisms also hold significant
potential to improve access to finance, at a lower cost, for rural and lower income populations.

9 1.    The measures to strengthen the business environment will support growth and employment
creation, key objectives of the Government. The measures aimed at reducing firm's entry costs, easing
registration procedures (by improving the operation of existing one-stop-shops outside Amman) and
rationalizing exit regulations will promote competition and favor a better use o f resources on an economy
wide basis. Firm's operating costs should be reduced by improvements in i) contract enforcement
processes (operationalization o f specialized commercial sections by nominating specialized judges in
courts outside Amman); and ii)in tax administration procedures (online filing system for tax returns and
electronic payment system) which will help existing firms to remain profitable. Overall, the combination
o f measures aimed at improving markets contestability and reducing firm's operating costs should lead to
improved profitability, higher firm entry and new employment opportunities, fostering output growth in
the medium term which should benefit the poor.

92.     While improving the long term sustainability and extending the coverage and scope o f social
security benefits, the social insurance reform attempts to correct some o f the main sources o f
inequality in the current system. Some specific mechanisms that will add progressivity to the social
insurance scheme include: (i)   change in the pension formula defining the pensionable salary as an average
o f a period o f 3 years prior to retirement, instead o f the current rule o f 2 years;42(ii)introduction o f
income-related accrual rates; (iii) extension o f social security benefits to workers in firms with less than 5
 employee^;^' (iv) partial elimination o f some regressive benefits such as early retirement and subsidized

                                                             n
     42 The use o f last salaries to calculate pensions i s a important source o f regressiveness. While the new Social
Insurance law will not adopt the recommended lifetime income to calculate pensions, the extension o f the reference
period will certainly have a impact. In fact, this measure benefits workers with lower wage growth, often those
                               n
with lower level o f education and qualification. For this group o f workers, average o f lifetime career i s not different
from the average o f the last two years o f salaries, so long as adequate wage valorization i s set in place. Hence, the
extension o f the base period to calculate average pensionable wage i s expected to have a progressive redistributive
impact.
    43 The extension o f social insurance benefits to firms with less than five employees i s expected to have a
positive redistributive impact. W h i l e the size o f the firm does not necessarily show positive correlation with the
average income o f the employees, many small firms o f the quasi formal sector with lower productivity and average

                                                              31
purchase o f years o f service;44(v) social insurance for the unemployed; (vi) maternity benefits financed
through contributions on all employers. Although unemployment insurance i s defined in the new draft
Social Security law as a system o f individual accounts, the provision o f resources partially financed
through employers' contributions will increase the protection o f workers who become exposed to the risk
o f losing their jobs. In the current system incentives to hiring women are low, since women employees or
their employers have to bear the costs associated with maternity leave. This also increases the wage
differential between men and women. The introduction o f maternity benefits in the new draft Social
Secuity law will tend to correct this undesirable redistributive impact by imposing the burden of financing
to all employers based on a payroll contribution on salaries o f men and women.

93.      Concerning the distributional impact of the N A F renewal, simulations have shown that the
new PMT-based targeting formula performs much better in terms of reaching the population below
a certain threshold than the current targeting mechanism. While the current system covers 20 percent
of the households with per capita annual consumption expenditures below JD396, the new targeting
mechanism could reach 8 1 percent o f such households. Raising the poverty line to JD504 increases the
number o f households below it and understandably worsens the targeting outcomes o f both systems.
However, even in the case o f the higher poverty line, the new targeting methodology was shown to be
able to reache four times more of these households than the current mechanism (62 percent vs. 15
percent), potentially significantly improving poverty outcomes. In terms o f cost efficiency, the
simulations indicate that the new targeting methodology will be much more cost-efficient in comparison
to the current system. Currently, for each JD that i s transferred to those with per capita consumption
below JD 396 per year (the target group), the NAF spends about JD 10, because of the high error o f
inclusion. The proxy-means formula improves this ratio to 1:2.5 due to 80 percent coverage and a
significantly reduced error o f inclusion. The NAF renewal plan also provides an opportunity to strengthen
management and monitoring o f programs by NAF through much greater reliance on ICT for evidence-
based administration of the programs. The forthcoming implementation o f the new system on a
nationwide sample of 6,000- 10,000 households, which the D P L focuses on, will provide further valuable
feedback on the distributional impact o f the new targeting mechanism and guide necessary improvements
prior to its nation-wide implementation.

B.       Environmental Aspects

94.     This operation i s a development policy loan in support o f a program o f reforms for which
the environmental requirements o f OP03P8.60 apply. Overall, policies supported by the proposed loan
                                                       on
are not likely to have any significant direct effects45 the environment and natural resources and
safeguard policies (such as OP 4.01 Environmental Impact Assessment) do not apply to this operation.




salaries will become contributors, therefore extending the benefits o f SSC membership to their workers.
     44
        Early retirement benefits and purchasing years o f service also have a negative distributional impact. Because
the penalties and costs are not actuarially fair at present, these mechanisms allow to substantially increase the
implicit rate o f return to higher income workers who can benefit from them. The new law will change the rules to
discourage and increase penalties to workers who opt for these extraordinary mechanisms to become eligible for
pensions.
     45
        Business environment reforms under this operation focuses on improvement o f the operation o f existing
facilities (one-stop-shops, courts) and/or in firm's operating costs and should not create risks for proper
environmental due diligence within Jordan's legal framework. Similarly, changes in expenditure policies are
intended for wasteful and/or low efficiency spending and do not target environmental budget or regulatory
functions.

                                                           32
C.        Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation

95.     The responsibility for implementing the program in Government rests with the Ministry of
Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC). The MoPIC i s responsible for the implementation
of the DPL operation as well as for coordinating the actions among the concerned institutions (such as
Ministry o f Finance, Central Bank, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry o f Justice, Ministry o f Social
Development and Social Security Corporation). Together with MoPIC, these institutions collect the
necessary data for the identified monitoring indicators. The MoPIC and the Bank have agreed to monitor
the progress in the program supported by the DPL and its evaluation will serve to inform preparation o f a
new Country Assistance Strategy (scheduled for FY2011).

D.        Fiduciary Aspects

96.      The overall fiduciary risk rated as "Moderate" based on             the Country Financial
Accountability review conducted during the preparation o f the proposed DPL.46    This rating reflects
existing sound legislative framework in the Public Financial Management (PFM) area, the Government's
implementation track record with the PFM reforms so far and its strong commitment to complete the
implementation o f ongoing major PFM reforms. Among the key reforms with importance in the fiduciary
context, notable progress has been achieved in particular: towards increased coverage o f the treasury
single account (TSA); transfer o f donor-financed projects to the respective budgets of implementing
ministriedagencies; towards integrated computerization of the accounting and reporting system; the
enhancement o f debt management; and, the introduction of the GFMIS, which paves the way for
modernizationof the internal control framework.

97.      Looking forward, the Government aims at sustaining implementation progress in the PFM
reforms agenda. In areas with importance in the fiduciary context, the Government has time-bound
action plans and aims to advance key reforms as follows:

     e    Treasury Single Account (TSA): At present, the TSA covers 80 percent o f Central Government
          (CG) expenditure and 60 percent of the larger General Government. To increase coverage, the
          Treasury i s currently finalizing the bidding process with the banking sector in order to transfer the
          remaining CG deposits from commercial banks to the TSA. The selected candidate bank will be
          able to act in regions where the Central Bank has no offices thus allowing the implementation o f
          zero balance accounts for ministries and agencies located in these regions. The treasury objective
          i s to include in the future also the deposits o f all independent agencies once the necessary
          legislative framework to this end i s in place. Three regions have been selected to be pilots for the
          daily fund transfers before the zero balance accounts are applied on a country-wide basis. The
          pilot phase i s expected to last six-months, with full TSA implementation i s expected by mid-
          2010.

          The Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS): The establishment of the
          GFMIS-which will automate 30 ministries and 15 fund centers when completed-is on track
          with minor delays vis-a-vis the original plan. The software has been developed and the final
          testing before going live in selected locations i s currently being performed. After testing the six
          pilot locations, the system will be rolled out to all users. Based on the existing implementation

     46
       Among the background documents reviewed were all the relevant assessments by the World Bank (Including
 n
a Institutional Financial Management Capacity Assessment (IFMCA) for the Education, and Social sectors with an
update o f the Government-wide PFM system), IMF, and other donors (including the 2007 PEFA); the field work
validated the progress made under the treasury single account (TSA) and on the GFMIS implementation.

                                                         33
        plan, the pilot locations are expected to be operational by November 2009 and the final rollout o f
        the system to all locations will take place during May 20 10-June 20 1 1.

        External Audit: To enhance i t s independence, the Audit Bureau phased out pre-audit activities in
        2007, to the benefit o f ex-post controls and audit. Also, it entered into agreement through twining
        arrangements with the UK National Audit Office and the German SA1 to enhance i t s capacity
        through support and transfer o f knowledge from the two institutions. In parallel, an amendment to
        the audit law i s currently being examined by the Cabinet. The amendment will provide the Audit
        Bureau with greater financial autonomy, thus increasing independence.

98.      Continued progress with implementation o f key PFM reforms will help contain fiduciary
risk over the coming period. This particularly concerns the following areas: (i) more comprehensive
                                                                                    a
accounting and reporting system to cover extra-budgetary funds, quasi-fiscal activities, arrears and
contingent liabilities and align with acceptable public sector accounting standards; (ii) greater coverage
and improved GFMIS specifications to include the extension o f GMFIS to the whole o f the budget and
central government accounts domain, and improved features for commitment control; (iii) enhanced cash
management through full implementation o f the Treasury Single Account; (iv) the establishment and
implementation o f a system o f modern internal audit; (v) enhancement o f the quality o f the external audit
function by the Government Audit Bureau including compliance with the standards o f the International
Organization o f Supreme Auditing Institutions (INTOSAI) for the conduct of audits - to support an
opinion on the fairness of the presentation o f the government's financial statements.

99.      The MoF i s monitoring progress with PFN reports through steering committees created to
manage the reforms. Each department has an action plan in place with target dates and these are
monitored through periodical meetings and updates to the minister and director general. Going forward,
the attention should move gradually to enhancing the internal controls in line with the new control
environment and modernization o f the internal audit function. Material progress in these areas would lead
to a reduced fiduciary risk to "low-moderate" level in the horizon o f 20 10-2011.

E.      Disbursements

 100. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
support. Once the loan i s approved by the World Bank's board and becomes effective, the proceeds o f
the loan will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated release conditions as defined in the
DevelopmentPolicy Loan Agreement and in a single tranche.

 10 1.    Flow o f funds (including foreign currency exchange) i s subject to standard public financial
management processes. As the loan proceeds will be deposited into the government treasury deposit
account in local currency (hereafter referred to as the TSA), it will be not possible to track the ultimate
use o f the foreign exchange provided by the DPL proceeds. However, the proceeds o f the loan will flow
into a dedicated foreign currency deposit account to be set up at the CBJ and from it to Government o f
Jordan's budget account being the TSA opened at the CBJ. The loan proceeds, being deposited in the
TSA, will be subject, when disbursed by the government, to standard public financial management
processes and CBJ procedures. By way o f a letter, the Government will confirm to the Bank once the loan
amount has been credited to the TSA which i s being used to finance budgeted expenditures. The diagram
below depicts the envisaged flow of funds arrangements:

 102. The CBJ will conduct a special transaction audit o f the dedicated account established in the
CBJ to deposit the loan amount. The audit will cover the accuracy o f the transactions o f the dedicated
account, including accuracy of exchange rate conversions; that the dedicated account was used only for
the purposes o f the operation where no other amounts have been deposited into the account. Also the
auditor will have to obtain confirmation from corresponding bank(s) involved in the funds flow regarding
the transaction. The audit should be conducted three months after all funds are transferred to the dedicated
account and then transferred out o f the dedicated account into the Government budget account (TSA).
The time period for submission o f the audit report to the Bank i s 6 months after the date o f the Bank's
request.

F.       Risks and Risk Mitigation

 103. Economic risks. The global crisis continue to unfold, exposing Jordan's economic prospects to
risks driving from further weakening o f global, and particularly Gulf, economy. At the source o f these
risks are still high level of public debt, large twin deficits and heavy dependence on remittances and
foreign aid. While the risk o f external instability arising from the capital account i s mitigated by the fact that
external debt i s owed predominantly to official creditors, and reserves provide comfortable liquidity cover
relative to short-term liabilities, heavy reliance on regional liquidity to sustain financing inflows translate
into high external vulnerability. Exports, including tourism, and remittances could slow more sharply than
anticipated as a result o f the regional economic slowdown, while tighter liquidity in the Gulf countries
may lead to lower capital inflows and grants. Lower economic activity and lower international prices, on
the other hand, checks the growth o f current account imbalance. If financing further dries, the contraction
o f real GDP and the increase in unemployment would be more pronounced over the coming year than
anticipated. This would strain the banks and the corporate sector and would also create difficulties for the
achievement o f the fiscal targets. The risk of gradual economic recovery has been incorporated into the
macroeconomic projections. The risk o f external financing difficulties i s mitigated by largely prudent
policies supporting a measured external adjustment and adequate liquidity, Jordan's relative attractiveness
to Arab investors, and significant donor support, including bilateral support from the US and Gulf states.

 104. Weakening political support. A prolonged and deeper domestic slowdown could add to social
pressures, lead to backsliding on resumption o f more disciplined approach to expenditure management
policies, and adversely impact the health o f the financial sector. In 2008 a resumption of expansionary
fiscal policy in response to price shocks has led to adverse public debt dynamics and increased reliance on
donor grants. This risk i s addressed by the fact that key measures, such as control over excessive tax
exemptions and capital spending, and elimination o f remaining key subsidies, which will reduce fiscal
pressures, are already being implemented as prior actions. Furthermore, the Governments medium-term
fiscal framework which establishes the expenditure ceilings for 20 10 budget and indicative ceilings for
the next two years, constrains the room for excessive spending without matching revenues. The risks in
the banking system have been further addressed through an active CBJ approach to identify risks and
strengthen the supervisory powers. Similarly, major risks related to the implementation o f specific
program components are not foreseen because the reforms are mature, supported by technical assistance
and widely discussed within the Government and with key stakeholders and donors,

                                 Development Policy Loan


    Dear Mr. Zoellick:

    Over the last decade, Jordan's development process has been marked by the enormous
progress made in economic liberalization-particularly      in opening the trade regime and
liberalizing private investment regime-in establishing modern regulation and institutions for the
private sector development and privatization, in strengthening public financial management
system, and in building human resources through a comprehensive education sector reform. The
process of structural reforms has been accompanied by a painful fiscal consolidation that has
steadily reduced government debt from above 200 percent of GDP in the early 1990s, to 62.4
percent by the end of 2008. A l l these achievements have helped our country establish a sound
record as one of the lead reformer in MENA.

     Despite the difficult regional political environment and our limited natural resources, we have
achieved above-average development outcomes within our income group. Underpinned by our
strong trade links with the region, our economy has shown strong performance since 2000 with
annual real GDP growth averaging 7.5 percent and per capita GDP more than doubling. Growth
has been broad based, led by manufacturing, construction, real estate and services sectors.
Commensurate with strong growth in investments and GDP, labor force growth in Jordan has
been strong. However, the unemployment among nationals declined slowly (from 14.5 percent
during 2000-05 to 12.7 percent in 2008). Inflation remained low (except for the surge in 2008
driven by international oil and food prices) and although the external deficit widened, sizable FDI
inflows enabled a steady and sizable increase in international reserves. While this can be credited
to sound development policies which attracted substantial capital inflows, Jordan i s vulnerable to
adverse external events, such as the recent increase in world oil and food prices and the global
recession as well as deterioration in external flows.

    Achieving sustained growth and reducing unemployment and poverty are the main
development challenges and the key priorities of the Government. Since 2005, Jordan's National
Agenda put i t s emphasis on transforming Jordan into a modern knowledge-based economy with
higher value added, increased productivity, employment and welfare through sustained and
broadly-shared growth, while achieving fiscal sustainability. Modernization of the country's
                                                                                       ANNEX1
                                                                                      Page 2 of 9

economic, institutional and political infrastructure, reforming education, improving the business
environment, and attacking deep poverty are at the core of this long-term development strategy.
The National Agenda distinguished three consecutive phases: the first phase (2007-2012) i s
focusing primarily on improving the business environment, creating employment opportunities,
and building the skills needed for the knowledge economy. The second phase (2013-2017)
focuses on strengthening the industrial base, and preparing the ground for the development of
high value-added sectors in the knowledge economy. The final phase (2018-onward) would
complete Jordan's transformation to a world class competitor in the global knowledge economy.

    The first phase of the National Agenda includes multi-ranging development areas. Among
these areas are political development and inclusion, justice and legislation, investment
development, financial services and fiscal reform, employment support and vocational training,
social welfare, education, scientific research and innovation, and infrastructure upgrade. The
Government programs approved since then, including the executive program for Kuluna a1 urdun
(2007-2009)--"We are all Jordan" initiative-have been consistent with the goals of the National
Agenda, and further defined and complemented i t s socio-economic objectives by setting up short-
to medium-term implementation initiatives aiming also to increase participation and
inclusiveness.

     In pursuing our development goals, we are now facing a harsh international environment
marked by the increase and volatility in hydrocarbon and commodity prices over the past few
years, and, more recently, the outbreak of the international financial crisis, which quickly
triggered an economic recession, primarily in developed countries. Jordan's real economy has
been subjected to the repercussions of this crisis through three channels: sharply lower global
and regional growth outlook (which affect exports and remittances), declining global oil prices
(which have a positive impact on trade deficit but a negative impact on transfers and capital
account), and declining private capital flows to developing countries (which were a major source
of growth for Jordan in the recent past).

    Reflecting these effects, domestic economic performance has worsened since September
2008. The collapse in commodity prices favored a reduction in expenditures through a decline in
budgetary subsides but also generated a drop in tax revenues because of lower prices and lower
economic activity, leading to increase in our financing requirement. Also, while improving the
current account balance, the decline in international prices and more broadly global turmoil has
reduced foreign inflows, and negatively affected growth.

     In light o f this, the Government of Jordan has responded to the global economic crisis by
accelerating the structural reforms which have been under preparation over the last several years
and by short-term policy actions aimed at addressing or preventing immediate adverse impact of
the crisis on the economy. The main objectives o f our policy measures are to: (i) reduce the fiscal
vulnerability by broadening tax base, and enhancing effectiveness of government expenditures;
(ii)increase resilience of the financial sector by further strengthening regulation and supervision,
and improving access to credit; (iii)improve the business climate to encourage more private
sector investment; and (iv) facilitate access of vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally
sustainable social protection system.

    These measures represent the continuation of past development policies and programs and are
based on the achievements of previous years at the same time as they draw on goals for the future
to achieve the established key objectives o f the National Agenda and to strengthen the
adaptability and the competitive positioning of the national economy.

                                                                                        Page 3 o f 9

    I. Experience and Achievements to Date

    Fiscal Adjustment and Reforms

     Our National Agenda calls for radical fiscal reforms to improve budget performance and
increase Government efficiency. It puts a particular emphasis on addressing expenditure pressures
in order to control the budget deficit especially to address vulnerabilities due to the expected
decline in foreign grants and increase in international oil prices over time. Among the key
reforms to improve the budget performance were (i)phasing out oils subsidies by 2007 along
with eliminating other subsidies; (ii)   pension reform; (iii) reform o f civil service pay and grading
system to improve productivity; (iv) accelerating privatization and channeling the proceeds to
facilitate the fiscal reforms; (v) tax reform to simplify the procedures, ensure fairness, broaden the
tax base and improve collection performance; and (vi) modernization o f customs administration.
We have made a considerable progress in implementing and or initiating most o f these critical
reforms, which will strengthen fiscal management.

    Gradual elimination o f the o i l subsidy significantly helped our fiscal position in recent years.
As part o f our fiscal consolidation plan under the National Agenda, we took a decision to
gradually eliminate the subsidy scheme: oil prices increased by almost 270 percent between July
2005 and April 2006 and the oil price subsidy eliminated as o f February 2008. Our budget deficit
excluding grants declined from about 12.0 percent o f GDP in 2004 to 6.6 percent in 2006.
However, in the face of sharp increase in hydrocarbon and commodity prices between 2007 and
2008, associated loss in real income for low and middle income groups, particularly in 2008, has
largely been compensated by fiscal measures (including tax reductions and exemptions, various
subsidies/transfers and substantial public sector pay increase). As a result, there has been an
erosion o f fiscal gains achieved over the previous years with the budget deficit excluding grants
increasing to 9.4 percent in 2008. Fiscal pressures further increased this year with lower tax
revenues than expected under the 2009 budget law despite some savings from budgetary
subsidies due to sharp decline in international commodity prices. In response, we are putting our
emphasis in the near term on preventing further increase in the budget deficit over and above
2008 level by bringing the implementation rate of the capital budget close to the recent year's
average o f about 85 percent, by rationalizing tax exemptions and by disciplining public
consumption. Over the period ahead, our emphasis will be on both continued public financial
management reform and key structural reforms that are critical to maintaining good economic
performance, and achieving faster decline in poverty.

     We have made a substantial implementation progress in public financial management
reforms. A number o f PFM reforms are currently underway, following the introduction of a three-
year medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) with the 2008 budget, a new Chart o f
Accounts, revision to the budget planning timetable to allow for the Budget to be promulgated
prior to the start o f new fiscal year and revision o f Jordan's Organic Budget Law. These reforms
include installation o f a Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS),
completion o f a Treasury Single Account, further development o f the MTEF, and implementation
o f steps towards the introduction o f some results-orientation in the budget process. When it
becomes operational, the GFMIS will significantly improve data reliability and will enable more
timely and accurate centralized accounts reconciliation.

      Concerning the public expenditure management and the MTEF reforms that were initiated in
2007, significant progress has been achieved in a short time although we are still at an early stage
o f these reforms. Among the achievements are: enhancement o f the macroeconomic and fiscal
analysis underlying the Budget; extension o f the budget planning horizon to three years; adoption
                                                                                        ANNEX 1
                                                                                       Page 4 of 9

o f improved procedures for setting ministry resource ceilings; introduction o f performance
indicators into the budget documentation; and piloting o f new policy-led budgeting procedures in
some ministries such as Health Care and Education. Looking forward, our emphasis will be on
strengthening the linkages between planning and budgeting with stronger focus on the efficiency
and impact of public spending (both current and capital) in budget analysis and preparation,
including through enhancing the strategic phase of the MTEF/budget preparation.

    Financial Sector Reforms

    The National Agenda puts its emphasis on strengthening governance and structure o f
financial services, facilitating funding to start-ups and SMEs, and developing the insurance
sector. Through these reform, we aim at consolidating the substantial progress that the banking
and insurance sectors made in updating the organizational frameworks and control procedures
governing company operations as well as in introducing new financial instruments, and
increasing competition and focus on retail banking.

     Over the last few years, the Central Bank o f Jordan (CBJ) has continued to carry forward the
strengthening agenda through further development o f bank supervision and ongoing updating and
issuance o f a number o f regulations which has brought Jordan more closely in line with
international standards. Some o f the areas addressed through this effort include, inter alia:
prompt corrective action, licensing, asset and liability management o f foreign currency, business
continuity, asset classification, corporate governance, internal control, and liquidity requirements
for Islamic banks.

    The CBJ has required banks to comply with the Basel I1 Capital Accord, effective 2008,
while requiring much more focus by banks on risk identification, anticipation, and management
processes. Preparation o f an annual Financial Stability Report has begun, increasing the
transparency of banking sector condition as well as policy making.

     The CBJ has also taken a number of measures to promote financial sector stability in the
wake o f the global financial and economic crisis. Banks are being encouraged to build capital
buffers, both through increased profit retention and through capital injections by shareholders,
and the CBJ continues its efforts to oversee the implementation o f the Basel I1 capital accord. The
staffing of the supervisory function has recently expanded with the employment o f fifteen new
staff and a new on-site supervisory manual i s in the final stages o f preparation. Global
consolidated supervision i s also being pursued. The CBJ recently conducted examinations o f
selected bank operations o f Jordanian banks abroad and intends to continue this program o f
supervisory visits in the coming year. In this context, it has increased contacts with foreign
supervisory agencies and has established memorandums o f understanding with thirteen foreign
financial sector regulators and two domestic regulators. Furthermore, plans for a formal
consolidated supervisory approach are being prepared which will include, inter alia, continuation
o f supervisory reviews o f Jordanian banking operations abroad, periodic supervisory monitoring
o f consolidated banking entities, and further interaction with other supervisors. A review o f the
existing legal framework to determine if it provides adequate scope to execute comprehensive
consolidated supervision will also be conducted.

     Currently, the CBJ i s in the process o f enhancing the implementation of stress testing o f
banks and indentifying follow up actions. Going forward, the exercise will be conducted annually
and will be used to assist in identifying and analyzing various forms o f banking risk, to contribute
to the analysis of capital adequacy under different scenarios, and when necessary, to identify the
possible need to require remedial actions from banks. Likewise, it will provide banks' and the
                                                                                      ANNEX1
                                                                                     Page 5 of 9

CBJ an additional tool with which to identify developing systemic trends. The CBJ and banking
sector are also in the process of undergoing a complete revamp of their statistical and regulatory
reporting. Through this initiative we aim to upgrade and automate regulatory reporting so that it
feeds into the Early Warning System; provide additional granularity needed to accumulate data
                                             1
series to measure compliance with Base1 1 ; meet the (standardized) statistical data reporting
configurations prescribed by IMF; and present the monetary and banking statistics on the website
(and elsewhere) with more depth and accuracy. The first run pilot test for system-wide reporting
i s currently scheduled for the end of 2009.

    The National Agenda emphasizes the importance of access to financial services for socio-
economic development, in particular for SME development and for the poor and marginalized.
The National Microfinance Strategy that i s adopted in 2005 sets out a market-oriented vision for
microfinance, with the public sector providing an enabling policy and legal framework, and not
directly providing financial services. Jordan has one of the highest rates of market coverage (46
percent) for microcredit in the region. Microfinance institutions lend to low income borrowers
(average loan balance i s less than one-third of GDP per capita) and to women, who constitute 84
percent of microfinance institution clients. Microfinance institutions are not allowed to also
directly offer savings and payment services, so broader microfinance access i s much more
restricted.

    More recently we initiated wide ranging legal and financial infrastructure reforms to broaden
access to financial services. The CBJ has embarked on lowering the threshold on credit reporting
by banks, while improving the timeliness and quality o f the reported data in the public credit
registry. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has led the preparation of a draft law to allow the
creation of a private credit bureau, which would further reduce credit risk by including
information on all borrowers, by including non-bank lenders such as financial and leasing
companies, and by enabling banks to expand SME and consumer lending safely using credit
rating and scoring techniques. Collateral constraints to increased access to finance have also been
eased alongside credit information deficiencies, through the 2008 Financial Leasing Law. We
expect to achieve further progress through a Secured Transactions Law that would allow the use
of movable assets as collateral and out-of-court collateral enforcement. Finally, we consider
telecoms and payments innovations as another avenue for improving access to finance in Jordan.

    Business Environment Reforms

    A key element of our development strategy i s to make Jordan an attractive location for
knowledge-based private investment in order to support further job creation. This rests on the fact
that the earlier waves of structural reform initiated in the mid 1990s did not trigger a sufficient
private sector response to significantly affect unemployment. To complement these reforms, we
broadened our free trade agreements (in the region, with EU and the USA) and engaged in an
extensive privatization program. By 2006, cumulated privatization receipts reached above 13
percent of annual GDP, and above 10,000 new direct and indirect job opportunities were created
owing to privatization and opening up the sectors to private investments.

    In order to further expand these gains we adopted a more strategic approach to capital
formation in 2008, combining efforts to improve the investment climate and attracdencourage
private business investment, which involves promoting Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for
selected infrastructure investments, and reserving the Government-only investment for general
public goods.

    In parallel, we increased our emphasis on the depth and pace of reforms to enhance the
                                                                                          ANNEX 1
                                                                                         Page 6 of 9

business environment. In 2008, we established a Committee to coordinate and facilitate faster
improvement in the business environment headed by the Ministry of Planning and International
Cooperation. The Committee, which includes representatives of ministries and agencies
concerned, devised a strategy to improve the business environment in Jordan on the basis of the
framework provided by the World Bank's Doing Business report, and key areas of concern
underlined by the 2007 Investment Climate Report. Key areas in this plan include:

   Improving entry and exit regulations to foster competition, In mid-2008, we reduced the
   minimum required capital to establish an LLC (from 795 percent o f GDP per capita in 2007 to
   24 percent in 2008) to encourage businesses to enter the formal sector. We are now aiming at
   abolishing both the minimum capital requirements for LLC and the requirement for depositing
   50 percent o f the capital of LLCs in commercial banks within the upcoming new Companies
   Law. Other measures in motion include expanding facilities for e-payment of registrations fees
   and taxes, expanding the one-stop-shop with specialized offices (municipality office, public
   notary, chamber o f commerce, chamber of industry, Income and Sales tax office) for company
   registration in additional locations and introducing a new Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law.
   Improving the tax administration process. A l l tax forms has been simplified since late 2008
   and an investor's guide to all taxes in Jordan has recently been prepared (April 2009). In early
   2009, an online filing system for Income Tax has become operational and, following a 2008
   amendment o f the relevant legislation, limited electronic payment facilities have been made
   available through the proprietary I T system of the Income and Sales Tax Department. While
   this i s a major improvement, the system i s still in i t s infancy. In the coming period, we plan to
   significantly improve and expand the system.
   Improving further the working o customs in order to facilitate trade. The introduction of the
                                       f
   ASYCUDA World System and i t s integration with the Single Window system currently
   operational in Aqaba, the Comprehensive Integrated Tariff System, and many other Customs
   systems since April 2009 will increase the efficiency of the Customs clearance process and
   therefore greatly facilitate trade.
   Improving contract enforcement procedures. Since early 2009, specialized sections (Maritime
   Law, Companies and Commercial Agencies, Intellectual Property, Liquidation and
   Bankruptcy, Documentary Credit and Letter of Guarantee) have been created in the first court
   of Amman which handles roughly 80-85 percent o f the civil cases (incl. business disputes) in
   the country. In addition, a computerization of case management and an electronic filing
   system are now being implemented in all courts. In the upcoming year, we plan to create
   similar specialized sections in the remaining 16 first instance courts of the country outside
   Amman. This new system should better facilitate the resolution of business disputes once it i s
   fully operational.

     We have also increased our emphasis on strengthening the framework for investment
development and growth across regions. A new draft Economic Zones Law has been prepared. In
order to rationalize the management of the zones and the incentives which are provided for
investors, this law proposes the establishment of a single authority that will merge the tasks of
overseeing the activities of three existing categories of zones (development, free and industrial
zones). This new authority will be autonomous, and will have the ability to conduct management
of the zones and establish other contracts (including contracts related to selling and renting land).
In addition, a new Investment Promotion Law i s being drafted for discussion in the upcoming
session o f the Parliament. I t aims to transform Jordan Investment Board into a pure investment
promotion agency without any kind of registration activities.

    Social Insurance and Social Safe@ Net Reform

     Among the core themes of our National Agenda i s social welfare which consists o f three
priority areas: (i)   public health care, (ii)social security and (iii)  poverty alleviation. In public
health care, the main challenges being addressed are developing a cost effective medical
insurance system to cover all Jordanians, reforming health sector policies and improving the
institutional framework, and enhancing the operational efficiency o f the public health care
system. In social security, we embarked on a reform plan to expand coverage, revise benefits and
eligibility criteria, and ensure financial sustainability of the Social Security Corporation (SSC). In
the poverty alleviation area, our priorities have been to reduce poverty rates via a series o f
strategic and institutional reforms, including renewal of the National Aid Fund (NAF), providing
assistance to the unemployed poor to integrate in the workforce, increasing penetration o f
microfinance services in poor communities, among others.

     The social security system o f Jordan provides old age, disability and survivors' pensions but
i s not financially sustainable as currently structured. It covers 36 percent o f the labor force at a
cost o f 5.7 percent o f GDP-among the highest in the region. The conclusions o f different
analysis conducted jointly by the SSC and World Bank reaffirmed the urgent need to introduce
reforms to make the system sustainable in the long term. In addition to this, there i s a need to
substantially increase the scope o f the social security programs in areas such as maternity
benefits, unemployment and health insurance.

     The SSC has prepared an ambitious reform proposal addressing the most critical issues
embedded in a new draft Social Security law. I t includes the following: (i) adjusting pension
benefit formulas and eligibility conditions to ensure financial sustainability and equity; (ii)
expanding coverage by extending the mandate to contribute to firms o f less than five employees;
(iii) introducing savings mechanisms to protect workers against the risk o f income loss due to
unemployment; (iv) introducing maternity benefits to finance maternity leave currently paid by
employers to eliminate a significant disincentive to hire women; and (v) introduce social health
insurance mechanisms. The Government has approved this law in June 2009, the discussion of
which was initiated in the July-August 2009 extraordinary session o f the parliament. As part o f
the reform process, the SSC also developed a comprehensive program to build institutional
capacity with the support of the World Bank and other partners.

     The reform o f the social safety net and the renewal o f the National Aid Fund i s another area
o f top priority. Overall, Jordan has most o f the programs commonly found in a relatively well
developed and diversified social safety net system. The objective o f the safety net reform i s to
improve the operations and management, coverage of the targeted poor population, and targeting
efficiency and effectiveness o f the cash assistance extended to the population through the NAF.

     Total public spending on safety nets i s estimated at more than 1.O percent of GDP, with two-
thirds (0.6 percent) spent through the NAF. The total number o f beneficiaries i s estimated at
about 8-10 percent o f the population, with NAF reaching 4.0 percent of the population. While the
total amount o f benefits would be more than sufficient to eliminate chronic poverty, recently
completed studies suggest that this requires addressing factors that limit the relative efficiency
and effectiveness o f the NAF, including improving the targeting method and strengthening NAF
administration, with emphasis on increased use o f Management Information System in managing
and monitoring programs. We aim to address both o f these issues through implementation of the
NAF Renewal Plan in partnership with the World Bank, which i s expected to increase NAF
coverage o f the target poor population and reduce the error of inclusion.

    11. Objectives and Components of the Program

    In this context, we consider the support o f the World Bank though the Recovery under Global
Uncerfainty Development Policy Loan to be important. The aim o f the loan is to support polices
adopted by the Government to promote economic recovery and improve the resilience o f the
Jordanian economy through the following actions:

   Reducing tax exemptions that distort relative prices and create inequity, and scrutinizing
   tightly introduction of future preferential tax rates via Cabinet decision threby: (i)
   eliminating all tax exemptions without specific duration or amount and issued through its
   authority; (ii)making Cabinet consideration o f any new exemption conditional on an explicit
   framework that identifies the rationale, costs in foregone revenues, and establishes a specified
   duration; and (iii) clarifying that no tax exemptions will be proposed through non-tax
   legislation.
   Enhancing fiscal sustainability through (i) a revised 2009 budget as a baseline for the
   medium-term fiscal framework (2010-12) in which 2009 public expenditures, other than
   subsidies, were reduced by at least 4.0 percentage points o f GDP compared to original 2009
   budget; and (ii)2010 Budget Circular with a comprehensive policy framework-including
   stable wage and salary expenditures in terms of GDP compared to 2008-09 and termination
   o f remaining subsidies for oil derivatives and barley-and resulting expenditure ceiling,
   which translates into a lower budget deficit before grants by at least 1 .O percentage point of
   GDP over 2009.
   Enhancing budget calendar to strengthen the initial strategic phase of budget preparation,
   during which budget performance, strategies and priorities are reviewed and medium-term
   spending requirements evaluated, This decision i s important as the new calendar includes a
   Cabinet level consultation in the first quarter of each year on the key parameters and issues
   underlying the development o f the MTEF based on a Budget Policy and Priorities Paper.
   Expanding analysis o f banking sector risks through issuing guidelines on stress testing to
   individual banks, and completing stress testing of selected banks, which, in turn, will inform
   our follow-up approach.
    Initiating a process o f broadening and strengthening the CBJ's consolidated supervision
    procedures through a plan to conduct consolidated supervision o f the relevant banks in the
    sector. Among the steps we plan are ensuring that the CBJ has adequate legal scope to
    effectively conduct comprehensive consolidated supervision; undertaking targeted
    examinations of inaterial foreign operations of Jordanian banking entities to infonn design of
   the relevant supervisory strategy(s); securing MOUs with the relevant host countries o f
   Jordanian banking operations; and regular update o f supervisory strategies to include
   documentation and oversight of banking group(s) overall organizational configuration,
   governance structures, group risk profiles and the like.
   Government commitment to address the lack o f information on potential borrowers that
   constrains S M E and individual lending in Jordan via approval by the Cabinet o f a draft Credit
   Bureau Law that provides a framework for sharing borrower credit information and history
   for both bank and non-bank borrowers, and that gives borrowers the right t o verify their data.
   Increasing the CBJ's ability to effectively monitor risk in bank lending while providing
   aggregate portfolio information for banks to enhance their credit scoring models via reducing
   the reporting threshold to the public credit registry initially from JD30,OOO to JD20,000,
   thereby doubling the number o f bank borrowers covered.

                                                                                   Page 9 o f 9

Government commitment to eliminate high costs o f creating a company via approval by the
Cabinet o f a draft Company Law, thereby (i)        abolishing the minimum capital requirements
for limited liability's companies and (ii) eliminating the requirement for depositing 50
percent o f the capital o f limited liability's companies in commercial banks.
Fostering firm's entry and job creation through expanding the one-stop-shop and
representative offices setting (already existing in Amman and five other locations in the
country) to the four locations which have not yet any representative offices, with offices for
municipalities and the Income and Sales Tax Department are fully operational.
Government commitment to improve the bankruptcy and insolvency regime in Jordan and
provide clarity for stakeholders, hence, allowing for easier market exit via approval by the
Cabinet o f a draft Bankruptcy and lnsolvency Law thereby defining secured creditor priority
order in bankruptcy cases.
Improving the resolution of business disputes and contributing to reducing the operating cost
of firms through instituting fully operational specialized commercial sections at eight courts
outside Greater Amman.
Improving tax administration for the benefit o f Jordanian firms by contributing to reduction
in their operating costs through initiating the implementation o f (i)an online filing system for
general sales tax return; and (ii)an electronic payment system for corporate income tax and
general sales tax connected to the e-government gateway.
Government commitment to establish mechanisms t o respond to adverse labor market
consequences of shocks to the economy via approval by the Cabinet of a draft program to
provide unemployment insurance benefits to the members o f Social Security Corporation, as
part o f the new draft Social Security Law.
Initiating the process towards improving the effectiveness o f the NAF by testing (on a
nationwide sample) the new targeting mechanism that is envisaged under the NAF Renewal
