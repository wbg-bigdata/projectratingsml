Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall development objective of the DPL is to support the implementation of the
Government’s medium-term development program in the context of the current global
financial crisis and economic slowdown. More specifically, the program supports
following policy areas, aiming at strengthening the resilience of the economy to better
position Jordan to resume and sustain high growth while cushioning the impact of the
economic slowdown on the poor and vulnerable:

        Reducing the fiscal vulnerability by broadening tax base, and enhancing
         effectiveness of government expenditures;
        Increasing resilience of the financial sector by further strengthening regulation
         and supervision, and improving access to credit;
        Improving the business climate to encourage more private sector investment;
        Facilitating access of vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally
         sustainable social protection system.

The DPL operation is a core element of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy, CAS,
(FY06-10) and the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (2009). It constitutes a
strong support of the three pillars of the CAS which seek to: (i) strengthen the investment
environment and build human resources for a value-added, skill-intensive and
knowledge-based economy; (ii) reform social protection and expand inclusion; and (iii)
restructure public expenditures and support public sector reform. By consolidating the
Bank’s long standing technical dialogue and assistance to support the key reforms in
these areas, this operation is also expected to inform the preparation of the new CAS
(scheduled for FY2011).

1.      Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Jordan Recovery Under Global Uncertainty Development Policy Loan (DPL)
was a stand-alone DPL which was prepared during 2009 and approved in November 2009.
The overall development objective of the DPL was to support the implementation of the
Government’s medium-term development program in the context the global financial crisis and
economic slowdown. More specifically, the program supported the following policy areas, aiming
at strengthening the resilience of the economy to better position Jordan to resume and sustain
high growth while cushioning the impact of the economic slowdown on the poor and vulnerable:
(i) reducing the fiscal vulnerability by broadening tax base, and enhancing effectiveness of
government expenditures; (ii) increasing resilience of the financial sector by further strengthening
regulation and supervision, and improving access to credit; (iii) improving the business climate to
encourage more private sector investment; and (iv) facilitating access of vulnerable groups to a
more effective and fiscally sustainable social protection system.

1.1     Context at Appraisal

2.      Jordan is an upper middle income country with a population of 6 million and a per-
capita GNI of US$4,390 (2010), and socio-economic indicators that generally exceed
those observed in comparable countries. Jordan’s economy is dominated by services,
which account for over 70 percent of GDP and more than 75 percent of jobs. Jordanian policy
makers’ ambition is using the demographic opportunity of a very young population to move
toward a high-wage, knowledge-based economy. The population is urbanized at around 80
percent and is one of the youngest among lower-middle income countries, with 38 percent under
the age of 14. Fertility rate (3.6 percent) is higher than Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
and lower middle income countries average. This transformation would require policies that
encourage business creation and remove the distortions that presently distract entrepreneurs from
focusing on Jordan’s comparative advantage which requires emphasizing the quality of
education—areas of priority in Jordan’s National Agenda.

3.       Over the last decade, Jordan had been very active in reforming its economy. It had a
sound record as one of the lead reformer in MENA, particularly in liberalizing private investment
regime, opening the trade regime, establishing modern regulation and institutions for the private
sector development and privatization, strengthening public financial management system and
building human resources through a comprehensive education sector reform. The process of
structural reforms had been accompanied by a painful fiscal consolidation that steadily reduced
government debt from above 200 percent of GDP in the early 1990s, to 60 percent by the end of
2008. While the price shocks in 2008 (which coincided with the elimination of oil subsidies) led
to divergence from the fiscal consolidation efforts with wide-ranging compensation policy, the
Government’s continued to emphasize economic reforms and macro-fiscal sustainability evident
by the approval of the Executive Development Program, the country’s medium-term development
plan (2011-13).

4.      Notwithstanding the difficult regional political environment and the lack of
resources, Jordan had achieved above-average development outcomes within its income
group. Underpinned by its strong trade links with the region, Jordan’s economy had shown
strong performance since 2000 with annual real GDP growth averaging 7.5 percent and per capita
GDP more than doubling. Growth had been broad based, led by manufacturing, construction, real
estate and services sectors. Inflation remained low (except for the surge in 2008 driven by


                                                 1
international oil and food prices) and although the external deficit widened, sizable FDI inflows
enabled a steady and sizable increase in international reserves. This could be credited to sound
development policies, recent substantial capital inflows and to one of the world's highest levels of
unilateral transfers (workers’ remittances and public grants, amounting to about 20-25 percent of
GDP). However, Jordan resumed vulnerable to adverse external events, such as world oil and
food prices fluctuations and the global recession as well as deterioration in external flows.

5.      At the time of the DPL, sustaining growth and reducing unemployment and poverty
were the main development challenges in Jordan. Against the background of strong growth in
investments and GDP, labor force growth in Jordan had been also strong. Thus, unemployment
among nationals had declined slowly (from 14.5 percent during 2000-05 to 13 percent in 2010).
On the other hand, unemployment was high for women and reached 21.7 percent in 2010 against
10.4 percent for male. Youth unemployment is twice the national average, an acute social
problem since nearly 70 percent of the population is under the age of 29. Close to 30 percent of
the country’s population falls within the 15 to 29 age range. Indeed, a key challenge for Jordan is
to absorb new entrants in the labor market, while reducing the unemployment rate.

6.       The global economic slowdown had created several medium-term challenges for
Jordan. The three most important of these are declining global oil prices (which have a positive
impact on trade deficit but a negative impact on transfers and capital account), declining private
capital flows to developing countries (which were a major source of growth for Jordan in the
recent past), and sharply lower global and regional growth outlook (which affect exports and
remittances). Reflecting these effects, domestic economic performance had worsened since
September 2008. The collapse in commodity prices favored a reduction in expenditures through a
decline in budgetary subsides but also generated a drop in tax revenues because of lower prices
and lower economic activity. Also, while improving the current account balance, the decline in
international prices and more broadly global turmoil has reduced foreign inflows, and negatively
affected growth.

7.       The economic slowdown had an adverse impact on the Kingdom’s fiscal balances in
2009, prompting the government to adopt a fiscal consolidation plan as part of its medium
term executive program (2011-2013). A combination of decline in domestic revenues, drop in
grants alongside a relatively stable expenditure levels have led to the quasi-doubling of the fiscal
deficit in 2009. This prompted the government to adopt a fiscal consolidation plan in 2010 with a
policy mix including rationalization of exemptions, increases in sales taxation on new
commodities, containment of public consumption, and rationalization of capital spending. The
plan designed by the ministry of finance has been adopted as one of the pillars of the executive
plan and was translated in a Medium Term Expenditure Framework which in its turn was
reflected in the 2011 budget law. The fiscal pillar in the executive plan sets an objective of
improving the fiscal performance, ensuring its sustainability and increasing the reliance on local
resources and calls for (i) rationalization of spending, (ii) restructuring of revenues, and (iii)
reducing the debt burden.

8.      Significant spending cuts helped narrow the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) by 3
percentage points of GDP in 2010, from 11 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 1). Faced with an
already deteriorating social climate, the Government chose to reduce capital, rather than current,
spending significantly in 2010. A drop in international prices nonetheless helped the government
to keep consumer subsidies at a low level but the recent surge in oil prices created a significant
challenge to the government financial positions. As foreign grants continued to decline, however,
such fiscal retrenchment proved insufficient to arrest the rise of public debt. The ratio of (net)
public debt, which had reached a low at 55 percent of GDP in 2009, crossed the 60 percent line in


                                                 2
2010 (Table 1). In addition, fiscal slippage emerged in 2011 and fiscal deficit (excluding foreign
grants) reached 11.6 percent of GDP due to combined effects of increase in expenditure and
reduction in domestic revenue.

9.       External current account deficit had deteriorated and became volatile since 2005.
Jordan had maintained current account positions that were broadly balanced from mid-1990s
through 2004. The deterioration in 2004-2005 and 2008 reflected an exceptionally rapid increase
in imports, as the saving-investment balance shifted. In 2008, the current account deficit was 9.3
percent of GDP, down from a peak of 17.3 percent in 2007. The FDI had financed about 70
percent of the deficit, with the remainder mostly as a source of remittances from Iraqi migrants
and overseas Jordanians. This allowed for a rise in official reserves which stood at 8.6 billion
dollars by end 2008 (up from US$7.5 billion in 2007). The external current account deficit
stabilized around 5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and was financed by FDI and
remittances. As a result, external reserves reached a record level at US$12.8 billion (about 8.6
months of imports) at the end of 2010. However, in 2011 the current account deficit was widened
to 9.3 percent of GDP despite comfortable level of reserves due mainly to the persistent increase
in commodity prices and higher cost of imports bill.


                                                                    3
10.      The confluence of the global financial crisis, economic slowdown and the increase in
commodity prices led then the GoJ to seek the assistance of the World Bank in 2009 and
tapped into the Bank’ fast-disbursing assistance through the use of the stand-alone DPL.
The Bank approved the single tranche DPL of US$300 million on November 23, 2009 to support
the Government’s efforts to address economic and social consequences of the global financial
crisis and economic slowdown while improving resilience of the Jordanian economy to adverse
shocks. The 2009 DPL thrust was focused on reducing fiscal vulnerability, strengthening the
financial sector, improving the business climate and enhancing social protection.

1.2       Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

11.     The overall development objective of the 2009 DPL was to support the implementation
of the Government’s medium-term development program in the context of the current global
financial crisis and economic slowdown. More specifically, the program supported the following
policy areas, aiming at strengthening the resilience of the economy to better position Jordan to
resume and sustain high growth while cushioning the impact of the economic slowdown on the
poor and vulnerable:

         Reducing the fiscal vulnerability by broadening tax base, and enhancing effectiveness of
          government expenditures;
         Increasing resilience of the financial sector by further strengthening regulation and
          supervision, and improving access to credit;
         Improving the business climate to encourage more private sector investment;
         Facilitating access of vulnerable groups to a more effective and fiscally sustainable social
          protection system.

12.     The DPL operation was a core element of the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy, CAS,
(FY06-10) and the Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report (2009). It constituted a strong
support of the four strategic objectives of the CAS which seek to “(i) strengthen the investment
environment and build human resources for a value-added, skill-intensive and knowledge-based
economy; (ii) supporting local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities; (iii) reform social protection and expand inclusion; and (iv) restructure public
expenditures and support public sector reform.? By consolidating the Bank’s long standing
technical dialogue and assistance to support the key reforms in these areas, this operation
contributed to the preparation of the new DPL 2012 and new CPS (2012-15).

1.3       Revised PDO

The PDOs were not revised.

1.4       Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The DPL focused on the following activities:

(i) Fiscal Adjustment and Reforms:

13.      This involved supporting the Government’s efforts to reinstitute the fiscal
consolidation plan so as to reduce large fiscal imbalances and to maintain macroeconomic
stability. Activities included: broadening the tax base, and improving efficiency and
effectiveness of the public expenditure policies, including through enhanced processes for


                                                   4
formulation and evaluation of fiscal policies.

(ii) Financial Sector Policies

A. Strengthening of the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework

14.      The main objective of this component was to support the CBJ in its continuing
effort to promote financial sector stability and bank soundness. This focused on the CBJ’s
efforts to identify and to respond to existing, perhaps previously unidentified risk through actions
to apply more rigorous risk management, improve capital adequacy and to take more “macro? or
high level actions to address systemic trends.

B. Access to Finance

15.    The aim was to support the Government’s objective of increasing employment and
reducing poverty through improved access to finance. Improved access to finance for SMEs
will contribute to achieving the National Agenda target of raising SME’s contribution to
employment in Jordan to 45 percent in 2017. Bank lending as a transmission mechanism for the
economic slowdown is amplifying the impact on SMEs and risks constraining private sector
employment and holding back the ability of the SME sector to play its part in economic recovery.

(iii) Business Environment Reforms

16.     The objective of this component was to further improve the business environment in
Jordan through reducing firms’ operating costs. More specifically, the reform was aimed at
focusing on reducing firm’s entry costs and improving the exit process; improving the resolution
of business disputes at the level of the judiciary in order to reduce firm’s operating costs,
allowing more firms to be created with positive impact on job creation and employment; and
easing the tax payment and filling. These actions were fully in line with the National Agenda
objectives and will help increase the real sector’s resilience to the adverse shocks to the economy.

(iv) Social Insurance and Social Safety Net Reforms

A. Social Insurance Reform

17.     The social insurance reform was designed to support the Government’s objective of
improving the long term sustainability of the social insurance system while expanding the
scope of the benefits to include unemployment insurance. To this effect, the regulatory
framework of the SSC will be reformed in the following areas: (i) old age, disability and
survivorship pensions; (ii) work injuries and professional diseases; (iii) unemployment insurance;
(iv) maternity benefits; and (v) health insurance.

B. Social Safety Net Reform

18.      The main objective of social safety net reform was to increase the efficiency and
poverty impact of Jordan’s social safety nets through acceleration of the NAF Renewal
Plan. Accelerating the NAF’s renewal plan has become urgent as fiscal constraints and poverty
concerns—especially given high exposure to external shocks—require that the poverty impact,
and effectiveness and efficiency of the social assistance be maximized. The renewal plan, which
has implemented, consists of: (i) implementation of a Management Information System to
establish a Database on Poor and Vulnerable Population; (ii) strengthening NAF technical,

                                                 5
administrative and benefit delivery capacity; and (iii) improving the targeting mechanism by
adoption of the proxy-means testing (PMT) targeting method.

1.5      Revised Policy Areas

The policy areas were not revised.

1.6      Other significant changes

There were no significant changes in the operation’s design, scope, scale, schedule and
implementation arrangements.

2.2     Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

19.     Jordan’s economy was impacted severely by the global crisis and regional political
turmoil, and has struggled to regain its balance ever since. Growth slumped in 2009-10 (down
to 2.3 percent in 2010) and fiscal deficit accelerated to 11 and 8 percent of GDP for the same
period, respectively (Table 1). In the face of disappointing revenue performance and dwindling
foreign grants, the GoJ was left with the decision to scale back public investment which has
impacted growth. Real GDP growth was stagnant in 2011 and increased only by 2.5 percent.
Therefore, it was difficult, on the country level, to implement actions that perceived as a cause of
hardship to the public especially at the state of regional political events. Actually, mitigating
measures that had a significant cost on the budget, such as increasing fuel prices to contain
subsidies and freeze up hiring at the public sector were proven to be difficult to maintain in 2011.

20.     The 2009 DPL program was broad and covered a wide range of areas, some of them
subject to difficult political economy, a fact that influenced implementation. For instance, the
design of the DPL was broad and did not sufficiently take into account of Jordan’s frequent
change in government that delays the execution of the reform program. Between 2006 and 2010,
the government changed four times. This can be observed during the initial stage of reform, as the
change in government indirectly contributed to further delays in the implementation of particular
measures of the reform program. Furthermore, it is important to take into account Jordan’s high
exposure to exogenous shocks, which may offset the expected impact of particular reforms and
the DPL implementation.

21.      The implementation of the 2009 DPL operation was facilitated by the strong
background analysis that support it, including policy notes, analysis conducted during the
preparation of previous operations, and other AAA, such as poverty assessment, Public
Expenditure Review, and Financial Sector Assessment Program. As a single-tranche DPL,
the team prepared a policy matrix that included too many actions that was designed to
accommodate the 2006-2010 CAS and the government program in that time. While most of
indicators of the program were met, some of them were structural in nature and not crisis related
in the sense that they covered vast issues related to the GoJ program and might not be suitable to
tackle the immediate crisis in hand. Further, the indicators that were specified at the DPL
program required underpinning analytical work and constant follow up to assure their
implementation.

2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

22.      Program performance was to be evaluated based on 14 quatitative performance indicators
that supported 4 policy areas which were specified in the program matrix. The performance
indicators were to be monitored through the Government’s own monitoring and evaluation
system. The Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MoPIC) resumed a consulative
role and responsible for coordinating the actions among the concerned institutions (such as
Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry
of Social Development and Social Security Corporation). Together with MoPIC, these institutions
collect the necessary data for the identified monitoring indicators. The MoPIC and the Bank have
agreed to monitor the progress in the program supported by the DPL. The performance indicators
selected were well-linked to the policy actions in the program matrix and well-linked to the
broader development objectives prompted by the operation but were not all crisis specific.




                                                 8
23.      However, the choice of the indicators was not well thought through to serve the crisis that
Jordan was facing at that time. For example, indicators such as unemployment insurance program
and the establishment of the credit bureau were structural in nature and had medium to long-term
implications that required constant follow up for its implementation. Furthermore, given the
nature of the operation (a one-tranche DPL with expected duration of one year), it would have
been unrealistic to expect significant changes in higher order development indicators within the
time frame covered by the operation. In addition, there were no supervision and monetoring by
Bank’s staff byond the approval of the Board. Hence, the design of the monitoring and evaluation
framework was concentrated on the government progress in meeting the conditions of tranche
release.

2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

24.      Based on the results of the initial stand-alone 2009 DPL, the Bank launched the
First Programmatic Development Policy Loan for Jordan in 2012. The 2012 DPL is aimed at
supporting government actions to develop a broad consensus on critical reform areas, especially
in the area of fiscal and institutional reform. In January 2012, the Bank Board approved the first
Programmatic DPL for an amount of US$250 million. The first programmatic DPL will
contribute to addressing Jordan’s weaknesses in the area of governance, fiscal management,
public sector efficiency and private sector-led growth. These are key areas of reform in Jordan’s
Executive Development Plan (EDP) for 2011-2013, around which the CPS (FY 2012-15) was
developed.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

25.      The Program Development Objectives (PDOs) were appropriate but covered a wide
range of objectives including structural issues that had long-term implications. The actions
taken under the four policy areas proved relevant in responding to the economic and social
challenges that Jordan faced in 2008 and 2009. However, implementing these actions and
translating the proposed laws into legal actions were proven to be a challenging task for the GoJ.
For example, laws such as the Bankruptcy and Insolvency law, and the Credit Bureau Law were
approved by cabinet but the implementation of such laws proved to be very difficult and required
constant efforts by the GoJ to enact these laws effectively. Hence, the design of the PDOs should
have been more appropriate if it was crisis specific.

26.      Efforts by the Government to reinstitute the fiscal consolidation plan to reduce large
fiscal imbalances and to maintain macroeconomic stability were successful for the year 2010
but the GoJ failed to have a sustainable impelementation for fiscal measures proposed by
the 2009 DPL. Activities such as elemination of tax exemptions and improving efficiency and
effectiveness of the public expenditure policies, were successful for 2009 and 2010 but they were
hard to maintain and the prior actions were reversed after 2010. For example, the cabinet issued a
decision to eleminate all tax exemptions without specific duration or amount and clarified that no
tax exemption will be proposed through the non-tax legislation. These decisions were
implemented for two years but reversed in 2011 and some tax exemptions were conducted again.
These actions and other expenditure sources such as wages and subsidies contributed to a higher
budget deficit in 2011 ( fiscal balance excluding grants reached 11.6 percent of GDP).


                                                 9
27.      The design of the “Recovery under Global Uncertainty? DPL as a stand-alone
operation was relevant in the case of Jordan given the nature and timing of the impact of
the exogenous shock on the Jordanian economy. However, some of the PDOs required
medium-term actions and structural in nature. Indeed, among the 14 prior actions, there were at
least 7 that involved matters which need follow-through in the medium term, e.g. establishment
of Credit Bureau, tax exemptions, commercial courts, unemployment insurance, social safety net
targeting. Many of the actions (including the Credit Bureau establishment) and fiscal
consolidation were picked up by the recent 2012 programmatic DPL which is a continuation of
the reforms supported by the 2009 DPL. Indeed in order to respond to the need of these prior
actions, a programmatic DPL was more suitable in that regard and a close monitoring is essential
to achieve the outcomes of the DPL.

28.      Given the complex design of the DPL, the GoJ’ succeed on identifying most of the
program objectives despite its limited implementation capacity. While the relevant lessons
learned from Bank experience elsewhere were correctly identified, the mitigation measures
proposed for two crucial lessons proved to be adequate in the case of Jordan. The first lesson was
the importance of developing ownership and accountability at the country level. The second
lesson was the importance of adequate coordination amongst different implementing ministries in
order to have an effective implementation of the proposed measures.

3.2.1   Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

29.     The 2009 DPL was successful in achieving most of its objectives but was not
successful in providing a sustainable path for the program’s DPOs to have a meaningful
outcomes. Of the fourteen development indicators specified in section 2.1, information could be
found on the actual performance of all indicators (Table 3), of which nine were fully achieved,
three partially achieved and two were not achieved. In particular, efforts to broadening the tax
base (38,000 individuals were added to the tax base in 2011) were successful but domestic
revenues were disappointing. Domestic revenues were stagnant at 22.6 percent of GDP in 2011
(Table 1). In addition, efforts supported by the operations concentrated on measures to reduce
fiscal vulnerability by eleminating tax exemptions and enhancing effectiveness of government
expenditures were not successful as the efforts to reform the subsidy system and contain the wage
bill were not complete. However, the Government was successful in enhancing the calendar to
strengthen the initial strategic phase of budget preparation. The calendar includes Cabinet level
consultations in the first quarter of each year on the key parameters and issues underlying the
development of the MTEF based on a Budget Policy and Priorities Paper (BPPP) prepared by the
General Budget Directorate. Unfortunately, efforts to enhance the calendar were not sustained as
the preparation of the 2012 budget was delayed and the approval of the 2012 budget was not
complete till March 2012. Overall, the final outcome for the reduced fiscal imbalances and
enhanced macroeconomic stability was partially achieved due to the inability of the Government
to adopt an effective approach to sustain successful reform and to some extent to global economic
and political factors that still shaping the region.

30.     The indicator strengthening the financial sector by further enhancing regulation
and supervision and improving access to finance were successful. The CBJ implemented
most of Basel II requirements on control and supervision. Consequently, the CBJ continues to
exercise prudent regulation and supervision of the banking system, and banks have remained
conservative in their funding practices (with the JD loan/deposit ratio near 73 percent at


                                               10
December 2011). The banking sector’s macro-prudential indicators were strong—banks remain
profitable and well capitalized, deposits (largely JD-denominated) continue to be the major
funding base, liquidity ratios and provisioning remain high, while non-performing loans increased
slightly to 8.5 percent at mid-2011. Credit to the private sector rebounded (growing by 9.5
percent y-o-y in December 2011).

31.      The GoJ succeeded in implementing business environment reforms identified by the
2009 DPL but the ranking in 2012 Doing Business Report was worsened. While the 2011
Doing Business Report acknowledged Jordan’ efforts in improving its credit information system,
the 2012 Doing Business Report ranked Jordan 150 out of 183 countries in terms of ease of
getting credit, higher by 20 points from 2011. This was a clear indication that Jordan needs to
create a Credit Bureau in order to improve SME’s access to financial services. In the same vein,
the GoJ needs to enact the recently approved Investment Law which aimed at reducing
restrictions to private investment. These two elements are the missing link that needed to improve
the business environment reform and might help to enhance the ranking of doing business for
Jordan.

32.      The GoJ did not succeed in increasing the efficiency and enhance the poverty
impact of Jordan’s social safety net by implementing the NAF Renewal Plan. This was due
mainly to the NAF’s limited implementation capacity. The 2009 DPL had pointed out to the
inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the NAF and provided a solid solutions through modernizing
the NAF. The GoJ had initiated a reform to establish the new targeting mechanism for NAF
which was included in the 2009 DPL (Table 2 and 3). The new targeting mechanism estimated
that 250,000 applications were received in 2011, which represented 25 percent of Jordanian
families. The database at NAF was not ready to receive this high volume of applications and the
update of the system and database were not successful in implementing the envisaged reform.

33.     At the time of development of the operation in 2009, Jordan confronted a downturn in
economic performance and reduced access to external financial markets. The Government had
adopted anti-cyclic economic policies in late 2009 to attenuate the macroeconomic impact of the
looming economic slowdown but was concerned with how the expected increased current account
deficit would be financed, particularly with reduced access to external financial markets and
reduced level of FDI, remittances and foreign grants. The World Bank finance was viewed as
necessary to substitute for this reduction in foreign financing. Thus, the operation largely
succeeded to provide the needed finance. While GDP growth fell in 2010 to 2.3 percent (from 5.5
percent in 2009), the rate of reserve coverage of imports was comfortable at over 7 months import
coverage in 2010.

On balance, taking into account all these factors, a DPL rating of moderately satisfactory
appears appropriate.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

34.      The overall outcome rating is moderately satisfactory. In general the DPL achieved most
of the PDOs. More importantly, delays and reversal of policy decisions were observed due mainly
to the regional political events and the design of the “Recovery under Global Uncertainty? DPL
as a stand-alone operation which some of the PDOs were structural in nature and required
medium-term actions.

3.5     Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

35.      Several issues concerning the performance of the safety net programs have emerged,
in particular the NAF. The main issue is that the poverty impact of the cash transfers has been
found to be modest: a major segment of the poor is not reached (low coverage) and the leakage of
resources to the non-poor is substantial. In 2006, only some 20 percent of people under the
threshold for the NAF assistance received NAF benefits, comprising 14 percent of the total
number of recipients; and only some 20 percent of recipients rose above the poverty line as a
result of receiving NAF benefits. The 2009 DPL had pointed out to the inefficiency and
ineffectiveness of the NAF. These include (i) weaknesses in targeting method; (ii) an incomplete
policy and institutional framework; (iii) overlapping institutional mandates as well as
fragmentation and duplication of programs; and (iv) weak monitoring mechanisms and modest
use of Management Information System in managing programs. The GoJ had initiated a reform to
establish the new targeting mechanism for NAF but the update of the system and database were
not successful in implementing the envisaged reform specified at the 2009 DPL.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

36.      Little institutional change could be achieved of this single tranche operation. Some of the
policy actions such as establishing a new budget calendar by Ministry of Finance, contibuted to
facilitate the first Cabinet discussion in the first quarter of 2010 on budget performance, strategies
and priorities. It has had an indirect impact on their institutional strengthening, by increasing
emphasis on budget preparation, and the evaluation of medium-term spending requirements.

N/A

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

37.     This rating results from the vulnerability of the development outcomes achieved
under this operation. This vulnerability arises from (i) the country’s high exposure to the
exogenous shocks from the Arab Awakening and from global economic and political factors
that are shaping the region; combined with (ii) a propensity to respond to them through
short term expedients rather than with a long term, growth oriented stance. As a result,
some of the positive results achieved under this DPL were not sustained or might be under
pressure. The rating takes into account Jordan’s high exposure to exogenous shocks related to the
global external environment and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In the same vein,
higher global fuel and food prices combined with the uncertainties created by regional political
developments and frequent disruptions of gas supply from Egypt have affected the Jordanian
economy. These factors combined have led to a larger import bill and lower FDI and tourism
revenues. The external environment going forward, both in Europe, globally and regionally, is


                                                 14
loaded with uncertainties. Events in Europe will affect Jordan indirectly through the US and the
region, Jordan’s main trade partners. A mitigating factor is however that Jordan has over the
years built considerable foreign reserve buffers to deal with shocks.

38.      Furthermore, some of the progress made under the DPL came under pressure as
circumstances changed. This is particularly the case in fiscal areas. While some of the
measures taken in the 2009 DPL, were controversial, the GoJ had succeeded in implementing
through 2010. Subsequently, the waves of demonstrations that have swept across the Middle East
and North Africa since early 2011, Jordan included, have given voice to the longstanding
aspirations and frustrations. In Jordan, the demonstrators’ demands have revolved around
lowering the cost of living, reducing unemployment, reducing corruption and increasing political
accountability of government bodies. The Government reacted with a mix of large scale fiscal
initiatives but tentative political overtures. As the political events evolved in 2011, the immediate
response of GoJ was to suspend the adjustment of domestic prices to global and regional
developments and initiated additional social spending which led to increased subsidies
significantly. The resulting worsening fiscal and economic conditions had impacted the DPL’s
main outcome, fiscal consolidation plan, contributing to an unplanned budget deficit as high as 12
percent of GDP in 2011. In this context, the institutional framework for fiscal management
supported by the DPL, proved unequal to the task of keeping medium-term fiscal consolidation
on track.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

39.     This rating reflects one positive factor and two negative factors. The positive factor was:
the exceptionally close link between the World Bank’s analytic work, and the design of the
operation. The analytical work included the programmatic assistance on PFM initiated in 2006
an ongoing analysis of fiscal policy and growth in Jordan, IMF’s Article IV reports, advisory
work on higher education and health, financial sector assessment program and the ongoing public
sector TA project. The continued quality of the analytic work is evident in that it served as an
analytic basis for the subsequent World Bank operation (First Programmatic DPL, 2012) which
addresses many of the same issues, but in a more specific and direct manner.

40.      On the negative side, the design set out in the operation had weaknesses. While the use
of relatively lower order outcomes as indicators is understandable given the short duration of the
operation, the quality of the indicators chosen should have been more considered to facilitate
close supervision in a fragile environment. In other words, the indicators that were used in the
2009 DPL were not crisis specific and some of them were structural in nature and required
medium-term follow up which went beyond the DPL associated PDOs. The other negative factor
is related to the conditions of the GoJ and their realism of the program. The DPL overestimated
the GoJ’s implementation capacity due to frequent change in government, which proved in
practice to be limited. However, the 2009 DPL was prepared under very difficult time constraints
to meet budgetary programming needs and that may influenced the design of the DPL.



                                                 15
41.      The combination of the high quality of the analytical work with poor design and a
fiduciary risk management that, albeit in a challenging environment, seemed to have considered
all possible options, suggest that an overall rating of moderately satisfactory is indicated.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

43.     Close dialogue continued on most aspects of the DPL program beyond the Board
approval and later intensified under the subsequent programmatic DPL. A range of
project, analytical and technical assistance activities formed the base of an effective
dialogue with the GoJ. These include but not limited to the programmatic assistance on
PFM initiated in 2006 an ongoing analysis of fiscal policy and growth in Jordan, advisory
work on higher education and health, financial sector assessment program, Investment
Climate Survey, social protection, poverty update and the preparation of a public sector
TA project (later dropped, as the engagement folded into that for the subsequent
programmatic DPL). There was no overall monitoring of policy implementation, or of
the results framework set in the program matrix (as evidence by the absence of ISN).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.2     Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

44.     The Government was actively engaged in the design of the operation, but failed to
undertake realistic plans for development outcomes to be delivered sustainably. The government
was not in the position to generate the political support in Jordan which would have been required
to move key pillars of the reform as envisaged. Overall, the GoJ succeeded, however, in
highlighting major obstacles to fiscal consolidation and strengthen fiscal management, which was
picked up by the EDP and core PDOs of the 2012 DPL.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

45.      The main coordinating agency was the Ministry of Planning and International
Cooperation (MoPIC). Other government institutions are responsible for the implementation of
their related function of the DPL operation. The MoPIC is responsible for coordinating the
actions among the concerned institutions (such as Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Jordan,
Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Development and Social
Security Corporation). More importantly, most of the actions envisioned under the program were
involved broad coordination with other Ministries and government entities, making coordination
very demanding, especially given the frequent change of government in Jordan. Over all, the



                                               16
MoPIC and other related Government agencies were successful in implementing most of the key
elements of the program.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

This is a direct result of the rating of moderately satisfactory for the Government and moderately
satisfactory for the implementing agency performance.

6.      Lessons Learned

46.     A key lesson learned from the 2009 DPL is that the realism of the reform agenda in
terms of content and risks has to be assessed carefully in the preparation of the operation.
For instance, the 2009 DPL was based on objectives that were spelled out on the 2006 CAS and
the CASPR results matrix. These objectives did not sufficiently take into account Jordan’s
frequent change in government that delays the execution of the reform program. While the matrix
continued to be broadly relevant throughout the time period of the CAS, certain milestones could
have been more realistic. Furthermore, in the design of a new DPL, it is important to take into
account Jordan’s high exposure to exogenous shocks, which may offset the expected impact of
particular reforms.

47.     The political economy of structural reform in Jordan is very complicated and
induced delays and the legislative process can take longer time that hindered serious efforts
to structural reforms. This was evident in some of the prior actions that required laws and
regulations to some certain sectors. Therefore, for future DPL program, in any attempt to design
and implement prior conditions, technical discussions ought to be at advanced stage on all
measures selected for inclusion in the DPL. It is also necessary to call for the approval by the
Council of Ministers as a crucial step that signals concrete change, even though Parliament
approval is required for draft laws to become laws.

48.      There is a crucial need for country ownership and other government institutions to
work in harmony and better coordinated spirit for the DPL program to achieve and deliver
results. Given their complexities and often cross-cutting nature, the pace and scope of reforms
should be driven by the judgment and tactical sense of the key Government counterparts. Where
the dialogue is well aligned with Government’s reform strategy in the Executive Development
Plan and complementary programs, the ownership and commitment for reform are strong.
Therefore, to enhance monitoring by government agencies, it is crucial to establish a monitoring
and evaluation system that depends on having sufficient capacity within the Jordan’s institutions.
Establishment of a sound M&E policy with clear institutional arrangements for collecting,
analyzing and reporting data is critical to implement an important reform and making evidence-
based policy decisions. This can be achieved by establishing separate entity that consists of
MoPIC and other institutions such as Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Jordan, Ministry of
Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Development and Social Security
Corporation that supervised by Bank staff to ensure its functionality and effectiveness.

49.      One crucial lesson learned from the 2009 DPL and will benefit future DPLs is that
close monitoring and supervision by Bank staff is critical for the success of engagement with
the GoJ. A constant monitoring and supervision by Bank staff is very important as well and the
need for Bank staff to have an evocative dialogue with the GoJ to set their priorities straight is
crucial to have meaningful outcome. While, it is understood that at the time of the 2009 DPL,

                                                17
Jordan was facing economic crisis due to the international financial crisis and at the end of the
CAS period but the need to align the PDOs with a tailored specific DPL that serves the country
precise problems is important in order to have a successful outcomes.

50.     Donor coordination plays a major role in program success, and the Bank should
make great efforts to preserve a unified dialogue within donors. This will benefit Jordan by
building credibility for the reforms, but also by focusing the attention and expertise from
multilateral donors on a complex program of reform. For the Bank and donors it might help to
mitigate the risk of this type of reform and reduce the supervisory burden on each donor.
