Section 2.01. The Bank agrees to lend to the Borrower, on the terms and 
conditions set forth or referred to in the Loan Agreement, an amount equal to three 
hundred million Dollars ($300,000,000).
Section 2.02. (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and 
(f) of this Section, the Borrower shall be entitled to withdraw the proceeds of the 
Loan from the Loan Account in support of the Program.
(b)
The Borrower shall open, prior to furnishing to the Bank, the first 
request for withdrawal from the Loan Account, and thereafter maintain in its central 
bank, a deposit account in Dollars on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. 
All withdrawals from the Loan Account shall be deposited by the Bank into the Deposit 
Account.
(c)
The Borrower undertakes that the proceeds of the Loan shall not be used 
to finance expenditures excluded pursuant to the provisions of Schedule 1 to this 
Agreement. If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any proceeds of the Loan 
shall have been used to make a payment for an expenditure so excluded, the Borrower 
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (i) deposit into the Deposit Account an 
amount equal to the amount of said payment; or (ii) if the Bank shall so request, 
refund such amount to the Bank. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall 
be credited to the Loan Account for cancellation.
(d)
Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, withdrawals from the Loan Account 
in any month during the execution of the Program, shall be permitted only up to the 
Maximum Withdrawal Amount as defined herein. For purposes of this sub-paragraph, the 
“Maximum Withdrawal Amount” shall be the amount of any withdrawal from the Loan 
Account which would, when added together with the amount of proceeds withdrawn during 
such month from the Loan Accounts for any of the Associated Loans, equal the 
Cumulative Withdrawal Ceiling for such month. The “Cumulative Withdrawal Ceiling” for 
any month shall be the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for such month (as defined herein), 
plus the cumulative amounts of any Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for any previous months 
which remain undisbursed and are carried over to such month pursuant to the provisions 
of this paragraph. The Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling shall be, for the month of September 
1998, equal to two hundred seventy million dollars ($270,000,000); and for each month 
thereafter, beginning in November 1998, shall be equal to seventy million dollars 
($70,000,000). In the event that the aggregate amounts of loan proceeds actually 
disbursed from the Loan Accounts for the Associated Loans in any given month shall be 
less than the amount of the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for such month, the difference 
between such actual monthly disbursements and the Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling shall be 
permitted to be carried over as an additional amount which shall be added to the 
Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling for the next succeeding month.  Such carry-over shall 
continue from month to month as long as any portion of a Monthly Withdrawal Ceiling 
remains unwithdrawn.
(e)
No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account: (i) after the 
aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have 
reached the equivalent of one hundred million Dollars ($100,000,000), unless the Bank 
shall be satisfied, after an exchange of views as described in Section 3.01 of this 
Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) with the progress achieved 
by the Borrower in the carrying out of Program; and (iii) that the actions described 
in Section I of Schedule 3 to this Agreement have been taken.  If, after said exchange 
Page  4
of views, the Bank shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress achieved 
and actions taken are not satisfactory and, within 90 days after such notice, the 
Borrower shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the Bank, 
then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the 
Loan or any part thereof.
(f)
No withdrawals shall be made from the Loan Account: (i) after the 
aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn from the Loan Account shall have 
reached the equivalent of two hundred million Dollars ($200,000,000), unless the Bank 
shall be satisfied, after an exchange of views as described in Section 3.01 of this 
Agreement based on evidence satisfactory to the Bank; (ii) with the progress achieved 
by the Borrower in the carrying out of Program; and (iii) that the actions described 
in Section II of Schedule 3 to this Agreement have been taken.  If, after said 
exchange of views, the Bank shall have given notice to the Borrower that the progress 
achieved and actions taken are not satisfactory and, within 90 days after such notice, 
the Borrower shall not have achieved progress and taken actions satisfactory to the 
Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan or any part thereof.
Section 2.03. The Closing Date shall be December 31, 1999, or such later date as 
the Bank shall establish. The Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower of such later 
date.
Section 2.04. The Borrower shall pay to the Bank a commitment charge at the rate 
of three-fourths of one percent (3/4 of 1%) per annum on the principal amount of the 
Loan not withdrawn from time to time. 
Section 2.05. (a) The Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of the 
Loan withdrawn and outstanding from time to time, at a rate for each Interest Period 
equal to LIBOR Base Rate plus LIBOR Total Spread.
(b)
For the purposes of this Section:
(i)
“Interest Period” means the initial period from and including the 
date of this 
Agreement to, but excluding, the first Interest Payment Date

“Interest Payment Date” means any date specified in Section 2.06 
of this 
Agreement.
(iii)

on or next preceding the first day of such 
Interest Period), as 
reasonably determined by the Bank and expressed as a 
percentage 
per annum.
(iv)
“LIBOR Total Spread” means, for each Interest Period: (A) one half 
of one 
percent (1/2 of 1%); (B) minus (or plus) the weighted

reference rates, for six-month 
deposits, in respect of the Bank’s outstanding 
borrowings or 
portions thereof allocated by the Bank to fund single currency 
loans

determined by the Bank and expressed as a percentage per annum.
(c)
The Bank shall notify the Borrower of LIBOR Base Rate and LIBOR Total 
Spread for each Interest Period, promptly upon the determination thereof.
(d)
Whenever, in light of changes in market practice affecting the 
determination of the interest rates referred to in this Section 2.05, the Bank 
determines that it is in the interest of its borrowers as a whole and of the Bank to 
apply a basis for determining the interest rates applicable to the Loan other than as 
provided in said Section, the Bank may modify the basis for determining the interest 
Page  5
rates applicable to the Loan upon not less than six (6) months’ notice to the Borrower 
of the new basis. The basis shall become effective on the expiry of the notice period 
unless the Borrower notifies the Bank during said period of its objection thereto, in
