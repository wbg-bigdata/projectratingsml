                         The project development objective was simplified and the revised objective is "to upgrade urban infrastructure to improve the delivery of basic urban services in under-
                         serviced communities in Kabul Municipality".

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Progress towards achievement of the project development objectives is satisfactory. 30 Lots for Works in 20 gozars in 6 Districts of Kabul Municipality were awarded (IDA and ARTF
                         financing combined), 29 are fully complete, one contract is 82.45% complete and will not be completed by April 30, 2012. This last contract which was to be completed in April has
                         suffered delays due to unseasonal rains after an extremely prolonged and severe winter in 2011 and mobility restrictions due to a deteriorating security situation in Kabul last year.

                         Discussions are underway for Kabul Municipality to assume the onus of completing this last contract, as the project preparation grant for the second urban project (to be implemented
                         by Kabul Municipality) will provide for retroactive financing.

                         A recently completed beneficiary assessment states that the upgrading was viewed overwhelmingly positively by residents of the gozars in which work was done.

                         Given the scale and diversity of planned and unplanned neighborhoods in 6 districts of Kabul Municipality that have been upgraded under KURP, considerable technical knowledge
                         on infrastructure costs has been generated. This is being synthesized by the KURP PMU and will be published as a guide for Kabul and other cities in Afghanistan.

                         Integration of selected neighborhoods into the urban fabric of the capital city was an explicit intent of the KURP . At appraisal in 2004 an average cost per hectare of US$17,500

                         (density 250 people/hectare or per capita investment of US$70) was to guide investment estimates for unplanned areas.

                         The Upgrading of unplanned areas under KURP has cost $22,553 per hectare - with the application of lessons learned, future upgrading could be accomplished at about US$20,000
                         per hectare.
