  The delivery date for the ICR of the Credit was extended on May 12, 2011 from September 30, 2011 to
June 30, 2012 by SARDE (approved by Paul Birmingham) to coincide with the closing date of the ARTF
funded Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project (P111825, TF092073). Subsequently the closing date of the
ARTF was extended to April 30, 2012, making due the ICRs for both on October 30, 2012. The ICR Team
subsequently was unable to gain access to key documents in IRIS for the previous six months, because an
internal audit identified that a number of IRIS documents had been mis-classified as "Official Use Only" or
"Public" even though they contained confidential information. To remedy the problem, the Bank's "wbdosc
support team" launched the Content Remediation Project which automatically reclassified selected IRIS
documents to "Confidential" as they were transferred to WBDocs. This made many of the documents
needed for the ICR unavailable. The remedy took longer than expected because of missing data in the
incoming documents and other technical issues with the access groups. There was a long turn around time
for each document that the ICR Team requested access to.

F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The original Project Development Objectives were to assist the Borrower in: (i)
improving capacity of the Ministry of Urban Development and Kabul Municipality in
urban management 3; and (ii) supporting the integration of selected neighborhoods into
the urban fabric of Kabul Municipality through the reconstruction and rehabilitation of
urban services and facilities 4.

These objectives were to be achieved by carrying out reconstruction and rehabilitation of
urban infrastructure in select neighborhoods (with an allocation of US$24.19m) and
enhancing the managerial capacity of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing
and the Kabul Municipality (KM) (with an allocation of US$0.55m).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised PDO was to upgrade urban infrastructure to improve the delivery of basic
urban services in under-serviced communities in Kabul Municipality5.

    Assumed Task Team Leadership five months before close of the Project.

3
  With an allocation of 2.2% of the Credit proceeds.
4
  With an allocation of 96.8% of the Credit proceeds.
5
  This revised PDO was aligned with the budget allocation for results to be achieved, which was not the
case at Appraisal.

                      The restructured Project achieved its target to upgrade 19 gozars with about
      Comments        92,000 people. Actual beneficiaries were 141,480 (2009 Project census surveys).
                      Today this number is probably higher due to densification.

  These indicators are extracted from the ISRs that drew on indicators from the Technical Annex
(equivalent of a Project Appraisal Document) and monitored over the implementation of the Project.

  The term “gozar? in Afghanistan refers to a city residential area with a defined boundary. A traditional
gozar in Kabul could consist of anything from 100 houses to 1000 or more houses. Each gozar has a Wakil
(representative) registered with the Municipality. Any one of the 22 districts of Kabul consists of many
gozars. Targets established at Appraisal of KURP therefore, were based on averages of estimates, and
would assume technical meaning by way of costs only once detailed surveys were completed – these took
place only after the PMU was established and technical assistance was in place some years into
implementation.

  There are some discrepancies in Project documentation – this figure is 92,400 in some documents, and
92,000 elsewhere.

I. Disbursement Profile




10
   The cumulative impact of multiple factors had impacted the Project’s performance, including MoF’s
unwillingness to use technical assistance judiciously when needed for consultants to undertake design and
project management, protracted negotiations to get agreement on appropriate technical standards different
from national standards for infrastructure design, delays in concluding contracts and processing of invoices
due to the highly centralized system of disbursements that exist in MoF, limited capacity in the contracting
industry etc. (for details refer to paragraph # 25 in Section 2.2)

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       The Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project (KURP) 11 was appraised soon after
major changes in the political and military situation in Afghanistan in the aftermath of
September 11, 2001 – a context of conflict, transition, and the emergency for
reconstruction 12. The country’s infrastructure was devastated, and most Afghans had had
little or no access to basic municipal services. The majority of State Institutions were
ineffective, institutional and legal frameworks were unclear, including for
municipalities 13 , and institutional capacities were severely limited. Urban population
growth was estimated to be double the annual national population growth rate of 2.8
percent. Urban development challenges were particularly acute in Kabul, which had
experienced a 15% increase in population between 1999 and 2002 due to migration of
landless refugees and internally displaced people. Land and real estate transactions had
gone unrecorded for decades, land markets were dysfunctional and informal settlements
of improvised houses on public land outside the limits of the land use master plan
prepared in 1978, had mushroomed all over Kabul.

2.      A key challenge in urban areas for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (IRoA)
newly created in December 2003, was the proliferation of informal settlements in Kabul
that were home to almost 80 percent of the city’s population. Representing a fixed
capital investment of US$2.5 billion14, not including the value of land, these settlements
were home to about 2.4 million people living without access to basic municipal services.
Although urban development and urban management was high on the Government’s
agenda and included in the Government’s budget for National Priority Programs, there
was no appropriate model for urban development that integrated informal settlements into
the main fabric of the city. Investment needs in urban areas were estimated to be
US$815.0 million over 2004-2010; donor commitments for it stood at US$40.0 million.

3.      The Bank’s Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) of March 2003, based on the
Government’s reconstruction strategy, was to provide financial and non-financial
assistance in areas where the Bank had a comparative advantage: (i) improving
livelihoods; (ii) fiscal strategy, institutions, and management; (iii) governance and public
administration; and (iv) enabling private sector development. Urban issues were to be
addressed through analytic services, institutional capacity building, and pilot initiatives.


11
   Initially called Emergency Urban Reconstruction Project, the word “emergency? was dropped after
Appraisal to better reflect the Government’s desire for implementation of programs of a developmental
nature.
12
   The Project was delivered within seven months as an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL) as are all
projects in Afghanistan. KURP predates the Bank’s current enhanced understanding and policies for
development in post conflict and fragile countries.
13
   The Municipal Act of 1927 had been abrogated during the Taliban regime with its own Law. This Law
had been declared void through a Presidential decree of 2000, but no new Law had been passed.

By way of analytic services, the Bank prepared six Urban Policy Notes for Kabul 15 .
Institution capacity building and pilot initiatives were supported by this project, the
Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project (KURP). The Project aimed to “introduce
contemporary techniques of urban planning, initiate programs for community based
upgrading of informal urban neighborhoods, urban land use planning, and initiate
modernization of the urban land management system.? Delivered within seven months as
an Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL), KURP predates the Bank’s current enhanced
understanding and policies for development in post conflict and fragile countries.

Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.       Donor engagement 16 in the urban sector was small and no donor was supporting
the delivery of a comprehensive integrated package of basic municipal services in
infrastructure-deficient planned and unplanned settlements. The identification of this gap
provided a niche where the Bank has a comparative advantage, given over four decades
of support for urban upgrading and integrated urban development around the world and
its ability to facilitate and sustain reform processes over an extended period of time with
sizable investment. It “was “uniquely positioned to respond to opportunities and
challenges by: (a) applying a systematic and long term approach to urban development;
(b) using the leverage of its lending volume and advisory capability to induce and
accelerate institutional and policy reforms and demonstrate sustainable approaches to
address shelter and urban development issues; and (c) making use of its extensive
international experience and converting the lessons learnt into best practices 17?.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)
5.      The PDO as stated in the Technical Annex (equivalent of a Project Appraisal
Document) was “to provide improved delivery of basic urban services in vulnerable
communities in Kabul Municipality through the upgrading of urban infrastructure and
enhancing the managerial capacity of MUDH and Kabul Municipality?. The PDOs as
stated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), were worded a little differently: “ to
assist the Borrower in: (i) improving capacity of the Ministry of Urban Development and
Kabul Municipality in urban management 18 ; and (ii) supporting the integration of
selected neighborhoods into the urban fabric of Kabul Municipality through the
reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban services and facilities 19.



15
   Between September 2004 and January 2005 “Kabul Urban Land Crisis: A summary of issues and
recommendations? (Series # 1); “Why and how should Kabul upgrade its informal settlements? (Series #
2); “Should Kabul grow by expanding to a new town or by building up its existing suburbs?? (Series # 3);
“What are the sources of conflict in urban land tenure?? (Series # 4); “Will formal documents of title and
the courts resolve all land disputes?? (Series # 5); “Conflict over property rights and resolution of disputes
in Kabul: Conclusions? (Series # 6).
16
   Donor engagement in the urban sector had been small but growing – European Union, GTZ, UNHCR,
UN-HABITAT, Japan, MEDAIR, CARE, USAID, Italian Aid, CIDA.
17
   Technical Annex, Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project, Report # T7629-AF, July 1, 2004.
18
   US$ 0.26m (1.04%) of total IDA credit was allocated to achieve this result.
19
   US$ 24.19m (96.8%) of IDA credit was allocated to achieve this result.

                                                       2
6.      With almost 97% of the Credit proceeds allocated to area upgrading, the key PDO
indicator was the number of people in approximately 45 gozars who receive improved
urban services and enhanced security of land tenure (Target: 250,000 people).

7.    Output indicators for the different Parts of the Credit as stated in the Technical
Annex were:
(i)   Number of hectares of urban land, including both formal and informal settlements
      subject to infrastructure improvements (Target: 1000 hectares with allocation of
      US$24.19m from the Credit proceeds, i.e. 96.8% of the Credit proceeds)
(ii)  Quality of manuals of procedures, skills developed; number of plot holders given
      enhanced security of tenure (Target: 5000 plot holders, with allocation of
      US$0.26m from the Credit proceeds, i.e. with 1.04% of the Credit proceeds)
(iii) Increases in own revenue as percent of base (Target: 100%); Months after FY end
      required to produce Annual audit reports (Target 6 months, with 0% allocation of
      Credit proceeds).
(iv)  Physical development plans; Project proposals (Target 6 plans; 1 Project
      proposal with 0% of Credit proceeds)
(v)   Number of km new roads, reconstructed roads; number of km repaired drains
      (Target: 160 kms with 0% allocation of the Credit proceeds)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

8.     The revised PDO for the Credit after first-order restructuring on March 25, 2010
was to upgrade urban infrastructure to improve the delivery of basic urban services in
under-serviced communities in Kabul Municipality, making the PDO’s scope
commensurate with the allocation of Credit proceeds (refer to paragraph # 21 for
description of the changes).

9.     The revised PDO Indicator in the DCA was: Number of people in approximately
16 gozars who receive improved urban services (Target: 92,000 people 20)

10.     The cumulative impact of multiple factors led to significant delays in the start-up
of the Project, and is discussed in detail in Section 2.2. Delays in implementation set in
as the Ministry of Finance remained reluctant to use Credit proceeds for consultancy
expenditures. With delays, construction costs in Afghanistan rose as international oil
prices increased - almost all construction materials in Afghanistan are imported. Delays
were exacerbated with deterioration in domestic security conditions. Financing was
finally secured by the Bank for Consultancy expenditures in March 2006 21 from an


20
   The target population was based on the interpretation of data from Ikonos satellite imagery of 2004
which had indicated that informal settlements had between 20 to 28 houses per hectare. Once the PMU and
technical assistance to the PMU was in place, but before census surveys in each gozar were done, in target
areas were done, KURP used an average of 25 houses per hectare with 6 people per household to establish
targets achievable within the available Credit proceeds.

   “Grant Agreement for the Feasibility Study Facility Project? (TAFSU) from the Afghanistan
Reconstruction Trust Fund was made available in 2003 to the Government of Afghanistan to assist in; (a)

                                                    3
ARTF Grant managed by MoF, the PMU and technical assistance was put in place, a
reassessment of targets achievable with the US$24.19m allocation for upgrading was
done, and targets scaled back from 45 to 19 gozars. With 3 of the 19 gozars being
located in the historic part of Kabul where unit prices would be higher, it became clear
that the budget for upgrading was insufficient for the revised target of upgrading 19
gozars. Additional co-financing from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Funds
(ARTF) was secured to address the shortfall for upgrading the 3 historic gozars, and in
2010 the Project was restructured in response to the Ministry of Finance’s (MoF) request
“to improve the Project’s overall performance management and implementation?.

11.     The ICR team finds inconsistencies in documentation particularly with respect to
Project outcomes/outputs and targets in Bank’s internal documents: Implementation
Status and Results Reports (ISRRs), Aide Memoires, Legal Agreements and Project
Restructuring papers. For example, the Implementation Status Report (ISR) Sequence #
8, December 28, 2006 set a target to upgrade 600 hectares with an estimated population
of 92,400 in 19 gozars. However in the ISRR Sequence # 15 the target is to upgrade 600
hectares with an estimated population of 92,000. The DCA of the Project at restructuring
(January 28, 2010) of the restructured Project recorded the reduced geographical scope
for the upgrading area (from 1000 hectares to 600 hectares) and number of gozars from
45 to 16, but the target number of beneficiaries was not consistent with the ARTF Project
Paper of 2008 which stated that the historic gozars were home to 40,000 people. The
ARTF Grant Agreement however states that the targeted beneficiaries from the ARTF
Grant in the 3 historic gozars were 11,059 – in which case the targeted beneficiaries from
the IDA Credit alone would be 92,000 less 11,059, i.e. 80,991 people. These
inconsistencies do not materially affect the achievement of targets after restructuring.

12.     The Revised Intermediate Outcomes as stated in the DCA Attachment 3, were:
(i)     Number of hectares of urban land, to infrastructure improvements (Target: 600
        hectares)
(ii)    Final account prepared yearly
(iii)   Physical development plan for Kabul.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
13.     Direct beneficiaries from upgrading of 618 hectares of land at the time of Project
completion stands at 142,215, which was the population, recorded at the time of census
surveys done between 2006 and 2009. As discussed in Annexes 3, 5 and 6, communities
in the neighboring gozars benefited from a cleaner environment due to reduced dust as
roads were paved; greater security due to street lighting; better access as taxis and other



developing capacity to define needs for developmental projects and programs, and to prepare projects and
programs that are suitable for funding by development partners and commercial sources; and (b)
commencing the process of developing local technical and professional consulting capacity. US$3.2
million from this TF050970 was made available for consultancy expenditures in 2006.




                                                    4
transport vehicles that now penetrate into areas that were inaccessible before; enhanced
access to ancillary facilities like education centers for children / adults / women that have
sprung up; more economic activity e.g. shops; and higher values of their property as a
result of infrastructure improvements 22. Infrastructure improvements have increased real
estate demand, and there has been neighborhood densification as residents have added
rooms to rent. Women and children were the prime beneficiaries of investments in water
supply, as was the Afghanistan Urban Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation
(AUWSSC), whose revenues from Project areas increased by 36% from the target area,
as the Project provided 5,121 new house or public tap connections. This revenue is likely
to increase once the water production and distribution investments supported by KfW,
originally scheduled for completion in 2006, are completed in the future, as 3,264
connections provided by KURP do not currently have water.

14.     The Project also generated 855,000 man days of skilled and unskilled
employment. In addition, engineers from small contracting firms benefited from training
delivered by the PMU and their Technical Assistance (TA) consultants in areas like
Project management, finance, materials testing, environment and social safeguards etc.
Many of these small firms grew, some getting absorbed into bigger companies as a result
of the capacity built under KURP, although this was not a specific indicator tracked
during implementation 23.

1.5 Original Components (as approved) (KURP-IDA Cr. 3967, and ARTF Grant TF#
092073)
15.    With 3 out of the 6 components of KURP to be financed by the Credit, KURP
consisted of the following parts as described in the DCA 24 :
     Part A: Area Upgrading in Kabul Municipality (US$25.11: US$24.19 from the Credit,
     or 96.8% of the Credit proceeds and an expected US$0.92 from donors): Carrying
     out an area-upgrading program in areas under Kabul Municipality’s jurisdiction
     focusing on poor, infrastructure-deficient, planned and unplanned neighborhoods by
     providing improved water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, access roads,
     hill-side steps, drainage and street lighting services and facilities.

     Part B: Land Tenure Regularization (US$0.64: US$0.26 from the Credit or 1.04% of
     the Credit proceeds and US$0.38 expected financing from donors): Developing an
     appropriate capacity, appropriate methodologies, and procedures to regularize urban
     land-tenure in the Borrower’s territory, including: (i) the carrying out of pilot
     schemes to test methodologies and assess capacity in four identified communities;

   Email from KURP PMU, September 26, 2012, confirmed during meeting on 22 October, 2012..
24
   It is unusual for a Bank Legal Agreement to include PDOs, component descriptions, and an agreement
for results to be achieved from a Project on the basis of an expectation that donor resources (usually off
budget in Afghanistan) would be secured. This was the case with KURP – the impacts are the following:
while the IDA Credit was for US$25.0m, the overall Project costs appear to be US$52.0m; result indicators
for which financing was not available were tracked throughout the Project life leading to poor performance
ratings; and there is a lack of clarity for efficiency analysis in the ICR: US$25m or US$52m?

                                                    5
      and (ii) capacity-building and training in the Afghan Cartography Office, the Kabul
      Makhzan 25, and other Project implementing agencies.

      Part C: Engineering and Management Support for the Borrower’s Urban Agencies
      (US$4.32m: US$0.55 from the Credit or 2.2% of the Credit proceeds and US$3.77
      expected financing from donors): Provision of engineering and Project management
      support including: (i) technical assistance by the Technical Support Unit to support
      the Program Management Unit, the Project Support Team, and the planning and
      design consultants; (ii) goods for the Ministry of Urban Development, Kabul
      Municipality, and the Afghan Cartography Office; (iii) auditing, monitoring and
      evaluation services, and (iv) incremental operating expenses. This component was
      also designed to be co-financed with other donors. IDA financing for the component
      was US$ 0.55m.

      Part D: Overall Capacity Building for Kabul Municipality (US$0.3m: No financing
      from the Credit, all expected from donors: Assisting Kabul Municipality by: (i)
      strengthening its revenue generation, financial management, budgeting and planning
      (other than town planning); (ii) capacity building for various departments including:
      (A) the planning and finance department and related sub-departments, (B) the income
      department, (C) the properties department, and (D) the control office; and (iii) the
      development, design, and implementation of simple operating procedures to improve
      efficiency. There was no IDA financing for this component.

      Part E: Preparation of Structure Plans and a Future Urban Project (US$1.64: No
      financing from the Credit, all expected from donors): Assisting the Ministry of Urban
      Development, Kabul Municipality, and other Participating Municipalities in: (i)
      preparing physical development plans; and (ii) building planning capacity, and (iii)
      preparing feasibility study for a future urban Project focusing on city-wide urban
      services in Kabul Municipality and other Participating Municipalities. The total cost
      of the component was estimated to be US$ 1.64m.

      Part F: Improvements to Main Roads, Drainage, and Traffic Management in Kabul
      (US$20.0m with no financing from the Credit). A program involving construction
      and rehabilitation of major streets and drains in Kabul Municipality that will include:
      (i) construction of new roads; (ii) reconstruction, repair, and overlay of existing roads;
      and (iii) repair of primary drainage channels and secondary drainage systems; and (iv)
      traffic management improvements. This component was designed to be co-financed
      through donor support. Total cost estimate for this component was US$ 20m.

16.     The components financed from the ARTF Grant 92073 were described as follows
in the ARTF Grant Agreement:

      Part A: Area Upgrading in the Historic Old City of Kabul (US$3.6m): Carrying out
      an area-upgrading program in the Historic Old City of Kabul through the


25
     The government agency which is the repository of land titles, deeds and other documents.

                                                      6
   improvement of basic tertiary infrastructure and services, including water supply,
   sanitation, solid waste management, access roads, drainage and street lighting
   services and facilities, in response to community needs and demands.

   Part B: Engineering and Project Management Support (US$1.76m): Providing
   engineering and Project management support for: (i) the development of
   methodologies and construction standards appropriate for the preservation of the
   cultural heritage of the Historic Old City of Kabul; (ii) the design, planning, and
   supervision of interventions in accordance thereof for the upgrade of infrastructure in
   the Historic Old City of Kabul; and (iii) the carrying out of capacity-building and
   training activities for Project implementing agencies.

   Part C: Support to Cultural Heritage (US$0.24m): Strengthening the capacity of
   MoUDA’s Department for the Safeguarding of Afghanistan’s Urban Heritage in order
   to develop policies for the regulation and upgrade of urban areas of historical and
   cultural interest. This component also supported implementation of a social and
   environmental impact assessment to inform the area upgrading plan for the Historic
   Old City of Kabul.

Project Costs: KURP-IDA Cr. 3967 and ARTF Grants (as approved)
17.     The table below provides a composite overview of the entire Project before
restructuring, the Credit as well as the two ARTF Grants, TF 050970 for US$ 3.2m for
TA, and # TF 092073 for US$5.6m for upgrading 3 historic gozars. The total IDA
support at the time of appraisal was envisaged to be US$ 25 million. The total cost with
IDA Credit and anticipated donor funding at the time of appraisal was estimated to be
US$ 52 million (although this was never realized, and the improvements to main roads
and drains envisaged was packaged under another IDA supported Project, the Kabul
Urban Roads Improvement Project).

                            Total Financing for KURP: US$33.8m


1.7 Other significant changes
19.     Finance for Consultancy services: As stated in paragraph 10, Ministry of
Finance’s reluctance to use Credit proceeds to finance consultancy services, US$3.2
million was made available from the Technical Assistance and Feasibility Studies
Facility 27 (TAFS, TF 50970) funded through ARTF in December 2006 for co-financing
of technical assistance for Project management as well as engineering preparation and
supervision of works. Another US$5.6m was made available to finance the civil works in
historic gozars through the ARTF TF 92073 for US$ 5.6 million to cover the short fall
for civil works from the Credit.

20.     Reallocation of Credit proceeds: A reallocation of funds amongst disbursement
categories in April 2006 enabled the Credit to finance consultancy services 28, recruit staff
for the Project Management Unit (PMU) to replace ministerial staff seconded to the
Project, and make up for the lack of co-financing for the land tenure component at the
time of Appraisal. Credit proceeds were reallocated from Component A (urban
upgrading) to Component C (Engineering and Management Support) and Component E
(Preparation of Structural Plans).

•      At the time of approval, co-financing not identified was intended to finance
consultant services. No co-financing was identified, and a reallocation of funds amongst


27
   TF050970 ARTF “Grant Agreement for the Feasibility Study Facility Project? was made available in
2003 to the Government of Afghanistan to assist in; (a) developing capacity to define needs for
developmental projects and programs, and to prepare projects and programs that are suitable for funding by
development partners and commercial sources; and (b) commencing the process of developing local
technical and professional consulting capacity. It was not earmarked for any specific project but for the
preparation of identifying and preparing projects and programs that would be suitable for donor support.
US$3.2 million from this facility was provided to KURP.
28
   There was also an increase in the cost of consulting services due to inflation and a decree from the
Ministry of Finance on the tax liability of consultants. Memo to CD, April 26, 2006.

                                                    9
disbursement categories was done in April 2006 so that the Credit could finance
consultancy services, including the PMU staff which were recruited replacing ministerial
staff seconded to the project, as well as the land tenure component due to the absence of
co-financing.
21.     Amendments to the DCA and extensions in the closing date of the Credit: The
DCA was amended twice, a level 2 restructuring the first time, and a level 1 restructuring
the second time?:
     •   For the first time on March 24, 2009 to (i) extend the closing date of the Project
         from March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010; and (ii) provide for an increase in the
         Special Account Authorized Allocation. No changes were made to the PDO or
         the PDO indicators, and the amendment required no exception to Bank policies.
     •   The second time on March 25, 2010 to (i) extend the closing date of the Project
         from March 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011; (ii) cancel components that were
         expected to be financed by other donors at Appraisal; (iii) reduce the allocation of
         funds for upgrading by 8%; and (iv) revise the PDO and output targets (paragraph
         13). This revision was necessary, among other reasons, to comply with the
         Government’s request to include all planned and unplanned areas within the
         administrative boundary of a gozar for upgrading, so the average area covered by
         the project was higher than the average gozar size used for budgeting in 2004.

22.     Extension of the closing date of the ARTF Grant: The closing date of the ARTF
Grant TF#50970 was extended three times to enable completion of works in historic
areas, largely because of the deteriorating security situation in Kabul since 2009 which
caused unpredictable mobility restrictions in the city, affecting the movement of
contractors that naturally led to delays in construction.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
23.      The urban agenda and the program outlined by the Ministry of Urban
Development Affairs (MoUDA) to which KURP tried to respond, was extremely
ambitious 29. Despite Project design supported by a qualified Bank team with required
skills, the team failed to exercise judicious selectivity in the scope of the Project - the
components chosen were neither straightforward nor simple, nor was there adequate time
to prepare them, nor were there adequate resources. There were also multiple
interlocutors for such components, increasing the number of entities that would be
involved in the implementation of the Project and consequently the complexity. In fact,
the municipal finance component was not managed by the KURP PMU but by the MoF.


29
   MoUDA’s program had the following elements: (i) Planning and Management aimed to strengthen
MoUDA’s capacity for planning and removing barriers to reconstruction; (ii) Housing to include serviced
land for self-help housing / grants for reconstruction and upgrading, and land policy interventions to
increase the supply of land; (iii) Infrastructure to increase provision of residential water supply, power,
roads, sewage treatment in Kabul and solid waste management in Kabul and five cities, (iv) Government
Building reconstruction especially in the provinces to complement the civil service reform program.

                                                   10
This complexity was further exacerbated by the inclusion of unfunded components that
needed implementation and monitoring arrangements different from the rest of the
Project making the Project unmanageable. There was no budget for contingencies and
therefore little recourse when consultancy packages were awarded at twice the estimated
budget. A lack of knowledge of the capacity of the local construction industry in 2003-
2004 when preparation took place, led to unrealistic time schedules for contract execution
which ultimately made contract management even more challenging than is the case in a
country where security conditions impact the market. Had the Project included only two
components, Infrastructure and Project Management, it is conceivable that the Project’s
implementation performance may have been both better and faster.

24.     The focus of the Project was upgrading of under-serviced urban settlements. A
number of key lessons on urban upgrading from international experience were
incorporated in the component’s design 30 . The introduction of urban upgrading as a
concept in any country is challenging, as such settlements are commonly perceived as
“illegal?. The component challenged the mind sets of the Afghans who had returned to
the country to assume influential positions in government – this leadership had not only a
strong nostalgia for the green Kabul they had left behind 31, but were also motivated to see
Kabul “develop? rapidly, i.e. in a planned manner, as unplanned development was not
seen as development despite the enormous private investment in such areas. Upgrading
requires significant advocacy and knowledge sharing which takes time, to bring about a
change in mind-set from perceiving unplanned settlements as “illegal? and therefore
worthy only of demolition and urban renewal. The policy notes on Kabul and Upgrading
prepared by the Bank did win champions for the concept at the highest levels in the MoF
and MoUDA, but there was little time to cultivate the champions needed in KM where
the Project investments were made..

2.2 Implementation
25.     The cumulative impact of multiple factors caused the Project to perform poorly in
its early years. These factors ranged from (i) the new leadership being slow to
acknowledge challenges of implementation managed through government employees
with little motivation or commitment; (ii) the MoF’s unwillingness to use Credit proceeds
for technical assistance judiciously when needed although the Credit proceeds were
intended to finance this 32 ; (iii) frequent personnel changes on the client side; (iv)
inadequate experience and capacity for procurement in conformity with Bank
requirements; (v) protracted negotiations to agree on appropriate technical standards and
design norms with the engineers of KM and reaching agreement for delivering water
connections for households without land tenure rights; (vi) delays in concluding


30
   (i) The importance of “ownership? of investments by stakeholders who are responsible for operations
and maintenance; (ii) Flexible design standards that reduce costs and minimize disruption so that upgrading
can go to “scale?, and (iii) Ihe importance of beneficiary participation.
31
   This had been identified as a risk at the concept stage, and a decision was taken to focus on Kabul alone,
as opposed to additional cities, to minimize the risk.
32
   During Negotiations, the financing of all Consultancy services, apart from US$100,000, was removed
from IDA financing and was to be co-financed (Restructuring paper, February 2009).

                                                     11
contracts and processing invoices due to the highly centralized system of financial
management in Afghanistan where no Project funds are provided at the Project level, and
all payments are made by the MoF severely affecting disbursements; (vii) delays due to
limited capacity in the construction industry for cash flow management and adherence to
technical specifications; and, (viii) timely and accurate submission of invoices with
supporting documentation to the MoF. Project management and implementation
arrangements were not in place at Project effectiveness, and much of the design work that
is usually done for infrastructure Projects before Appraisal, did not start until some two
years and five months into implementation, when TA and Project Management Unit
staffing was in place 33

26.     Agreement on use of Credit Proceeds for TA took time. Reluctance on the part
of MoF to use the Credit proceeds for establishing a Project Management Unit (PMU)
and procuring the TA created a two year delay – both these were imperative to initiate
detailed design work so procurement of contractors for civil works could begin. In
December 2006, US$3.2 million was made available from the ARTF TF # 50970 for co-
financing of TA, along with a commitment by the Bank to seek financing for the PMU in
MoUDA as required by the DCA.

27.     Project Management and Implementation Arrangements: The Project’s design
called for the PMU to be supported by firms that provided TA for Project management
known as the Technical Support Unit (TSU), and firms known as the Planning Design
and Contracts Management (PD&C) firms that were responsible for community
mobilization, preparation of upgrading plans, detailed designs and supervision of works.
All procurement in Afghanistan is managed by the Afghanistan Reconstruction and
Development Service (ARDS) whose capacity limitations (which still exist) caused a two
year delay in procuring TA for the PMU whose procurement was not completed till
February 2006. Furthermore, it took the Bank time to persuade the MoF to allow KURP
to establish its own procurement capacity with staff recruited at market salaries, and
ultimately the Government made an exception for KURP.

28.     Final selection of upgrading areas and a revision of key assumptions: The
original target of 250,000 vulnerable 34 beneficiaries established in 2004 had to be revised
once detailed studies were completed to finalize gozar selection. Meanwhile upgrading
work had been undertaken in the historic parts of Kabul by other donors 35 and provided
some guidance on higher upgrading costs in historic areas that was not available during


33
   KURP Mid Term Review Report, November 2007.
34
   A study to determine eligibility criteria was undertaken, based on vulnerability and service deficits, and a
scoring system for the criteria and related indicators developed based on secondary data and district
administrator interviews. A preliminary list of neighborhoods viable for upgrading were developed
(approximately 90 neighborhoods) based on the scoring system and screened through the findings of a
sample survey to more narrowly define the preliminary selection to approximately 60 which best meet
vulnerability and service deficiency criteria. Service deficits were identified and prioritized through
interviews with municipal, ministry, district and neighborhood representatives, in addition to the household
survey.
35
   The Agha Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) and the Turquoise Mountain Foundation (TQM) had begun
work in a neighborhood called Murad Khana.

                                                     12
preparation. It is important to note that the per hectare upgrading costs of works done by
other donors was not, and is still , comparable to the costs of comprehensive upgrading
under KURP, as donors have supported single sector interventions within a settlement,
and not a full package of basic infrastructure and services. It became possible to
determine trunk infrastructure needs and boundaries of selected gozars that led to the
revision of key assumptions, e.g. the average size of a gozar assumed to be 20 hectares at
Appraisal, turned out to be 70 percent higher, i.e. 34 hectares 36 as the area under the full
administrative boundary of the gozar, planned and unplanned, was included for
upgrading upon request from the Government 37 . Had the original target number of
gozars been maintained, it would have resulted in an estimated US$50.0 million short fall
in resources. Physical targets to be achieved therefore had to be revised, and the Project
was restructured. In the absence of concrete results to show, seeking additional financing
for a project that had hardly disbursed in three years, was not an option.

29.      Impact of oil price increase and security issues on construction costs:
Afghanistan’s construction industry was deeply impacted by the uncertainty
accompanying the volatility in oil prices 38 ., as the industry is almost entirely import
dependent. During 2007-2009 when the bulk of the works contracts were bid upon, the
consumer price index had soared. Cost estimates had to be revised upwards from
US$17,500 per hectare in 2004, to US$28,000 in 2006. By 2009, there had been a
dramatic increase in suicide attacks and roadside bombings, discouraging bidders
resulting in lower competition. Lower competition also resulted from the few qualified
bidders who preferred not to participate in government sponsored procurement as
opportunities became abundant with NATO sponsored construction, until KURP
established a reputation of good governance in the industry. Finally, apart from the short
construction season in Afghanistan because of the weather conditions 39, the last years of
implementation saw a deterioration in security conditions which led to mobility
restrictions on contractors, causing more implementation delays.

30.     Mid Term Review: The Mid Term Review (MTR) took place in November 2007
when 60 percent of the Credit was committed, and 14 percent disbursed 40. The capacity
of the PMU and its supervision consultants was severely stretched, with indications of
this worsening in the subsequent years as the award of more upgrading packages were in
the pipeline. The land tenure component 41 for which the Project had allocated just
US$260,00 had just been initiated, although progress on this had naturally remained a
significant challenge. Although the scope of Structure Planning component had been
reduced from five to three cities due to budget constraints, it was not progressing well


36
   An indicator of number of gozars had little technical meaning as a performance measure for results from
upgrading, as upgrading costs are area sensitive, and not community, population, or density sensitive.

    Land tenure issues are extremely complex to address even when there is a project focused entirely on
them, leave alone as an under-funded component of parent project that relies of unpredictable donor funds

either. The ICR finds that the Project team did not make adequate recommendations for
the remaining implementation period during the MTR, missing the opportunity to address
Project design issues and the related implementation constraints that had affected the
Project’s performance.

31.     The issues identified at MTR were addressed much later, almost three years after
the MTR when the first order restructuring took place in January 2010. At restructuring,
the civil works component of the PDO to which approximately 97 per cent of credit was
allocated was retained while capacity building part of the PDO to which about 1.04 per
cent of funds were allocated was dropped. The capacity building components were
designed to be co-financed through other sources and suffered with implementation
bottlenecks when co-financing was not secured and were dropped 42, although they taxed
the Project teams on both the client and Bank side. Despite all these issues, the main
factors contributing to the overall successful results and achievement of the PDOs, was
the relevance of urban upgrading, and the performance of the PMU.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
32.      Design and Implementation: The Project was initially monitored using the
Results Framework as set out in the Technical Annex of KURP, and, after restructuring,
using the Results Framework as set out in the DCA which was specific and measurable
and aligned with realistic budget allocations for components, based on estimates of area
and density using satellite imagery43. M&E arrangements mandated the requirement of
quarterly or more frequent supervision missions during implementation. The Project in
its lifetime has been supported through 21 supervision missions. About 14 of these
missions were fielded during 2005-2009. The Project’s M&E design included a
Management Information System (MIS), that was used by the PMU to regularly monitor
Project progress and performance, which was reported upon monthly, quarterly, bi-
annually, and annually even after the TA to the PMU was completed in September 2010.
The MIS system enabled instantaneous extraction of any information for any kind of
analysis for regular or specific monitoring – it also provided a solid foundation for
analysis for the ICR and for preparation of the forthcoming urban project for Kabul that
is under preparation. Quarterly reports were provided to IDA. Implementation of M&E
systems improved with the establishment of the PMU and the TSU. A household survey
undertaken by the PMU’s social team as part of the preparation of community
development plans, provided baseline data on beneficiaries in each gozar, and although
there has been an increase in population since then, the PMU used this data to report on
final beneficiaries who received improved urban services through KURP at the time of
the ICR.




42
   With US$300,000 allocated for this component from the Credit in a context of conflict, transition and
emergency when state institutions had been rendered ineffective, the scope of this component (see
paragraph 15 Part D) was unrealistic, although with the technical assistance provided to the Municipality
through the ARTF Grant managed by MoF, the preparation of annual accounts was achieved.
43
   Estimates based on satellite imagery need to be ground trothed through surveys – this was done by the
PMU as detailed plans were prepared for upgrading gozars.

                                                    14
Utilization
33.     The ICR team would like to highlight some inconsistencies in documentation of
Project targets which merits attention. For example, the number of gozars and the
beneficiaries have not been the same in different Project documents such as the
restructuring paper of January 2010 and ARTF Grant Agreement. However, these
inconsistencies did not materially affect the achievement of targets and should be judged
as documentation errors. The performance of the PMU in supervision of civil works and
contracts has been satisfactory. Moreover, the forthcoming Project which is under
preparation will benefit from the capacity built within the PMU.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
34.     Safeguards: The Project was rated as Category B and the Bank’s Operational
Polices on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11)
and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) were triggered. The Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) developed for the Project included a set of procedures
and mechanisms for ensuring that environmental and social considerations were an
integral part of the Project. The ESMF requirements were included in the Project
Implementation Manual (PIM), and Environment and Social Impact Assessments
(EIA/SIA) were undertaken for historic “gozars? for which Cultural Heritage
Management Plans (CHMP) were developed.

35.     Site specific ESMPs for all sub-Projects were part of the contract documents and
assured contractors’ activities were in compliance with guidelines for health and safety,
prevention or compensation of any loss of livelihood and environmental degradation.
The PMU conducted safeguard trainings for PD&C consultants on supervision of ESMP,
complaint handling, land acquisition and consultation with communities. Civil works
were monitored through regular site visits to ensure that requirements of the
Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) were adhered to and immediate
remedial actions were undertaken when needed. A Community Consultation Manual
developed by the PMU guided all community consultations which were an integral part
of the Project. Participation by beneficiaries had a direct impact on the Project’s ability
to manage social safeguards issues. No formal land acquisition was anticipated or funded
under KURP and wherever the need for minor land requirements arose in connection
with the upgrading of roads, water supply or other interventions, the community members
resolved the issues through negotiations. As a result, some community members
voluntarily relocated their latrines from the right of way, while in other instances larger
or smaller community compensation for affected people were agreed upon, where the
affected households were unable or unwilling to donate minor pieces of land for
upgrading work. KURP maintained full documentation of these processes which are
used as examples of Good Practice for social safeguard training in Afghanistan 44. The
Project was consistently rated Highly Satisfactory for social safeguards. PMU enforced
policies for contractors’ contracts ensuring that the latter could negotiate with Project
Affected People to mitigate negative impacts. The Bank promptly addressed another

trigger to safeguard policy, OP 4.11, when KM destroyed five houses in the historic site
of Andrabi for establishing commercial property, warning that such action could also
pose a reputational risk to the Project and KM and would adversely impact Project
implementation.

36.     KURP was not formally mandated to develop local-level, democratic and
inclusive representative bodies, but it facilitated the establishment of elected community
councils called gozar Cooperating Shuras (GCSs). These GCSs represent each selected
gozar. The Project developed draft bye-laws for the GCSs, a Community Consultation
Manual, and a Grievance Redress Mechanism. These manuals have become models for
other Projects in the country, supported by the Bank and other donors.

37.     Financial Management: The Project closed with a ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ FM
rating and the ICR concurs with the rating. The Project operated under the steadily
improving Public Financial Management reforms under implementation by the
Government of Afghanistan with the World Bank/ARTF assistance. Proper records of
grants received and disbursements through the designated account were maintained by
the MoF’s Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) which eventually migrated from a manual
to an automated Afghanistan Financial Management Information System (AFMIS). The
funds flow was timely, and proper records of eligible expenditures were maintained by
the PMU. The internal controls were adequate. Regular IUFRs in the agreed format
were submitted during the life of the Project. Annual audited financial statements were
submitted regularly. The audit opinion of the Control and Audit Office of Afghanistan
was unqualified (clean) and audit observations were promptly resolved. The FM capacity
was strengthened during the course of the implementation.

38.     Procurement: The Project closed with a ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ Procurement
supervision rating in the last ISR and the ICR concurs with the rating. Procurement,
managed by the PMU, was guided by IDA Guidelines which posed constraints to
implementation. Until the TSU mobilized to support the PMU, there were delays as
MoUDA staff did not have the necessary capacity for procurement. Delays then occurred
due to constraints in the local contracting industry, and a large volume of bids were
rejected in the early years as local contractors were unable to meet the qualifying criteria
to bid on high value contracts. Failure to meet all of the qualification criteria as per IDA
Guidelines also led to delays. The Kabul Procurement Team got agreement from the
Bank’s Regional Procurement Advisor to reduce the normal qualification requirements
for the contracting industry in Afghanistan. Large contracts were also split into lots
where technically feasible to attract additional competition from bidders who could meet
the requirements of post qualification. While these steps led to considerable progress in
the procurement and award of contracts (the first works contracts were awarded only in
2008), contract implementation periods often could not be met, either due to a lack of
realism as knowledge of the local contracting industry was limited, or because of security
conditions. A majority of the contracts could not be completed during the period
stipulated in the contracts, and there were many contract extensions. All these challenges
notwithstanding, towards the latter part of the Project, PMU staffs were able to manage
procurement under the Project without help from the international firm that was the TSU.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
39.     KURP investments covered (i) roads, drains and culverts (83% of the total
expenditure); (ii) water supply investments (11.8% of the total expenditure); (iii)
sanitation or latrines (1.8% of the total expenditure); (iv) waste collection points (0.2% of
the total expenditure), and (v) street lights. Operations and Maintenance (O&M)
arrangements for the infrastructure components is discussed below:

(i)      For 60 percent of the roads that were delivered in the unplanned areas, the
         communities signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the
         Municipality’s district offices to assume responsibility for maintenance. For the
         remainder 40 percent of the roads built in the planned areas, the Municipality is
         responsible for maintenance. However, since for the first time quality assurance
         and quality control procedures equivalent to international standards were
         implemented 45, the technical quality of design and construction are excellent and
         for the next five to ten years no maintenance is foreseen apart from routine
         cleaning 46.

(ii)     For water, the communities signed a MOU with the water utility assuming
         responsibility for maintenance of the tertiary distribution pipe from the secondary
         distribution pipe along the street to the house. Responsibility for the primary and
         secondary distribution pipes rests with the water utility AUWSSC 47. As a result
         of the fragmentation of donor support that is delivered off budget, KfW has been
         unable to deliver on its water investments that were supposed to have been
         completed in 2006. 63% of the new water connections provided that do not
         currently have access to water, will get water when KfW supported investments
         are completed in 2013. However, recent data suggest that little progress (10%)
         was made with the distribution network construction which implicates
         unavailability of water supply to the households in 2013.

(iii)    O&M of the latrines are the responsibility of the individual households.

(iv)     Responsibility for bringing solid waste to the community collection points lies
         with the community, and the GCSs have employed sweepers for house to house



45
   The ICR Team undertook a detailed analysis of the infrastructure provided by KURP (Note in files) with
a view to analyzing design standards, construction specifications, and costs. Roads in unplanned areas
were designed to functional standards to limit costs and are well below the national planning standard for
tertiary roads which is 7m width. Costs of roads completed under the Project were found to be comparable
to the costs of the roads executed under other projects in Kabul, for example under the JICA funded Kabul
Solidarity Program. The ICR notes that through better urban design of the roads in unplanned areas more
pedestrian friendly, and through the application of better streetscape principles, the costs of roads could be
reduced by 20% (by leaving more land area for landscaping and street furniture rather than paving the
entire right of way) and drains by 30% while contributing at the same time to improved street environment.
46
   The proposed Kabul Municipal Development Program (P125597) has a strong focus on strengthening
the planning, budgeting, and monitoring of Kabul Municipality’s finances, as well as asset management.
47
   Institutional strengthening of AUWSSC is being supported by the Afghanistan Urban Water Sector
Project (P087860).

        collection. However secondary collection and transfer is the responsibility of the
        KM which will be unable to discharge its responsibility in the absence of a
        functioning city-wide solid waste management system that is adequately
        resourced through the taxes (the proposed next urban Project’s municipal finance
        component will support strengthening of the collection of this tax).

(v)     Responsibility for changing bulbs for street lights lies with the individual
        households as the street lighting provided in the gozars is not on top of utility
        poles, but fixed on the boundary walls of the houses. Ensuring uninterrupted
        power supply is the responsibility of the power utility and outside the scope of the
        Project.

40.     Transition to the next urban Project for Kabul: Following the closure of KURP,
two new urban engagements are planned. One of those 48 would focus on scaling up
urban upgrading, and be implemented by KM and is to be supported by the multi-donor
ARTF with a proposed US$100.00 million grant. Guidelines for safeguards, technical
standards, methodologies for community organization, mobilization, and participation as
well the roles of the beneficiary community in resolving safeguard issues developed
under KURP, are being adopted for upgrading throughout the country and are an input
into the development of a National Upgrading Policy by MoUDA.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

41.    The Project objectives were and remain highly relevant for Afghan cities that
have significant proportions of their populations in informal settlements. The PDO
remains well aligned with the Bank’s continued focus on strengthening institutions and
programs that can sustainably ensure equitable delivery of basic services. Given the scale
of migration to Kabul and the unplanned nature of development occurring rapidly, KURP
through investment of more than 95 per cent of credit in urban upgrading has
demonstrated the viability of area wide upgrading of informal or unplanned settlements
as an important tool to deliver basic services to a large and growing under-serviced
population. It has established a cost effective methodology that integrates planned and
unplanned areas of the city through the delivery of targeted trunk infrastructure, while at
the same time strengthening the social capital of beneficiary communities by laying the
groundwork for socially and gender inclusive community participation in decision
making over public expenditure for service delivery that directly impacts the urban
community.




48
   The second IDA-supported proposed urban project is expected to invest in five secondary cities, with a
view to piloting a future performance grant system for municipalities.

                                                    18
42.     The inclusion of components not financed by the Credit, without confirmation of
on-budget financing from donor commitments for the components, was a design feature
that was highly avoidable as it stretched the supervision resources of the Bank and unduly
taxed the PMU’s capacity. With project management costs typically between 3 to 10
percent of the total project budget in Bank-supported projects, with 97 percent allocated
for upgrading there was not much left to finance other components. However, since
IDA’s early engagement in Afghanistan, there is a much better understanding of the
political economy of donor aid in Afghanistan today. The lack of an established PMU
either during preparation or soon after effectiveness also created unnecessary challenges
in an already difficult environment – this management capacity and technical assistance
was essential but delayed till the Bank was able to mobilize additional resources for
consultancy expenditures to comply with MoF’s desire to not divert funds from “works?
to “consultancies?.

43.     The Project’s implementation arrangements were relevant in view of the weak
capacity as well as unwillingness on the part of KM to deliver investments in unplanned
areas. Ultimately, MoUDA through a well-staffed PMU supported by qualified
consultants implemented the Project and the Project started to fully take off as
demonstrated by the increasing rate of disbursement and the achievement of the Project’s
targets. The PMU continued to perform well even after the TA contracts were completed
and its performance is testimony to the robust capacity building that took place amongst
the local Afghan staff in the PMU. For scaling-up upgrading under the follow-on Project,
it is these Afghan professionals that are to be absorbed by KM, making subsequent
interventions in upgrading efficient.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

44.     The Project is rated moderately satisfactory in terms of achieving the PDO, as
97% of the Credit proceeds were allocated for achieving results on the ground for
beneficiaries with respect to the delivery of basic municipal services originally, and this
figure rose to almost 98% by the time the project was restructured (see table under para
8). Though KURP achieved the revised Project targets satisfactorily but slow progress in
the period before restructuring led to considerable reduction in targets as a result of price
escalations. Uncertainties in securing co-financing delayed contracting of design &
supervision consultants and resulted in cost escalations which necessitated revision of the
PDO. By March 2009, the Project completed upgrading of only 179 hectares. In the post
restructuring phase, the Project made remarkable progress and over-achieved the PDO
(upgraded 618 hectares instead of 600 hectares). The institutional development impact of
KURP has been well recognized as urban upgrading has gained universal acceptance
amongst leaders and policy makers in Afghanistan as a viable urban development tool.
With almost 97% of the Credit proceeds allocated for upgrading

45.    Upgrading Component: The Project awarded 23 works contracts for area
upgrading, and 9 contracts for trunk infrastructure to upgrade 19 “gozars? for a total cost
of US$26.62m. Improved services were received by over 140,000 people, the number
determined to be living in the upgrading areas through household census surveys that
were conducted prior to preparing community upgrading plans. With all the contracts
completed at the time of the ICR 49 , and with an increase in population over the last
couple of years, it is safe to assume that the number of beneficiaries would be higher.

46.    Final Account prepared yearly (i.e. preparation of financial accounts for Kabul
Municipality: In March 2006, the baseline for the Municipality’s own revenue was 700
million AFN. This doubled to 1.5 billion AFN by March 2008. At Project closing, the
ICR Mission found that KM’s revenue is close to 3 billion Afghanis, i.e. a 400 percent
increase over baseline of 2006. The target of systematic preparation of annual accounts
for the Municipality was achieved by 2008. However, this was a component not
managed by the PMU but by MoF, and should not have been included in KURP – or if it
had, should have been adequately budgeted for.

47.    Physical development Plan for Kabul: The last development plans for
Afghanistan’s cities were prepared in 1978. At restructuring, the scope of this
component was scaled back to limit it to Kabul city alone. A Structure Plan for Kabul
was completed in June 2009. It was the first time that multiple agencies came together
with the consultants to pool data, and work jointly towards future growth scenarios. This
plan was an input to the later master plan developed by JICA and the New Kabul Plan
which is being developed for New Kabul City.

3.3 Efficiency
48.     Feedback from Focus Group Discussions 50 (FGD) during the beneficiary
assessment done by a private firm just prior to the closing of the Project, has been
positive: beneficiaries reported cost savings from medical expenses, better health for
children, higher monthly savings resulting from reduction in expenditure on clothes and
shoes, time and cost savings from transportation and overall, better living conditions.
Unavailability of data on household cost savings from transportation expenses, medical
expenses, household monthly savings and time savings from traffic improvements


49
   Some works were not completed by the closing of the project, but were completed by the time of the
ICR, and payment of this amount was made by the Borrower from its own funds.
50
   Consultant’s report of these discussions, including dates, times and places, are in the Project Files

                                                  20
reduced the scope for an economic analysis. Comparative cost efficiency analysis with
respect to other donor investments was difficult as no donor has supported a
comprehensive multi-sectoral intervention in any settlement alongside trunk
infrastructure improvements to integrate informal areas with the main fabric of the city.
Donor interventions have been focused on a single element, e.g. UNHABITAT in Kabul
has supported improvements to a road within a community. USAID in Jalalabad has
worked for the last eight years on tenure security.

49.     The Project only realized US$ 33.8 million out of the “virtual? US$52 million
estimated at the time of appraisal. Total expenditure under KURP amounts to US$ 31.6
million which reflects 93% expenditure efficiency. The Project could not implement the
component “Improvements to Main Roads, Drainage, and Traffic Management in Kabul?
due to non-availability of donor funds (but this was later taken up under another IDA-
supported project). Costs for the works components under area upgrading escalated after
significant implementation delays. The Project has spent approximately 27% of Project
funds on PD&C consultants which exceeds the norm for design and supervision by about
7%. However, considering the physical and financial (price) contingencies which are
prevalent in Afghanistan, this ICRR provides a satisfactory rating for the efficiency
aspects of KURP despite time lost before the Project was restructured causing
implementation to span almost eight years.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50.     The overall outcome is rated moderately satisfactory for the following reasons: (i)
Project objective was relevant; and (ii) it achieved its stated development objective to
upgrade urban infrastructure to improve the delivery of basic urban services for under-
serviced communities in Kabul and met all physical targets; (iii) institutional
development impact of upgrading has been significant; and (iv) performance for
efficiency parameters is judged satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

51.     KURP targeted under-serviced communities in Kabul, directly benefiting over
140,000 people living in informal settlements that were home predominantly to the poor
and recent urban immigrants. No separate study was done regarding poverty impact, but
the beneficiary assessment highlights not only substantial improvement of services, but
also associated economic benefits in terms of reduction of transport costs, reduction of
cost to clothing and shoes due to cleaner environment and reduction of expenditures to
doctor’s fee and medicine, particularly related to children. Anecdotal evidence also point
to the improved infrastructure provided by KURP having positive economic impacts that
resulted in increased investments from small businesses, mainly in the informal
settlement areas where the majority are poor.

52.    Although KURP was not formally mandated to develop local-level, democratic
and inclusive representative bodies, or target gender aspects specifically, in response to

                                            21
the requirements of community participation in KURP, the Project facilitated the
establishment of elected and gender-segregated community councils called gozar
Cooperating Shura (GCSs) to represent the beneficiary community for liaising with the
Project. Thus half the GCS members were women who played an overall very active role
throughout the Project and were the Project’s strongest supporters. In several cases,
community disputes related to KURP upgrading were resolved only upon the intervention
and active mediation undertaken by the women. It also enabled the development of draft
byelaws for the GCSs, a Community Consultation Manual and a Grievance Redress
Mechanism. The WB and other donors are using these outputs as illustrations/models for
other Projects in the country.

53.     In keeping with the prevalent social norms, gender segregated representation
increased women’s active engagement in community mobilization, and women were
represented in their own separate GCS Shuras. Throughout the Project, special efforts
were made to ensure female participation, and half the GCSs members were women,
often the strongest community supporters of the Project. In several cases, community
disputes related to upgrading were only resolved by the intervention and active mediation
undertaken by the women of the gozar. The Project has thus effectively laid the
groundwork for socially and gender inclusive community representation and the
community’s active involvement in local-level decision making in the urban setting in
Afghanistan.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

54.      The risk to development outcome is rated moderate for the following reasons: (i)
urban upgrading is fully endorsed as a critical urban development tool, and national
Upgrading Guidelines developed by MoUDA are going through a final process of review;
(ii) strengthening community participation for urban development remains an integral
element of the upgrading investments in Kabul under the new proposed urban project;
(iii) the trunk infrastructure investments supported by the Project remains capable of
service delivery despite increased demand and usage; and (iv) institutional strengthening
and financial sustainability are being concurrently supported by IDA for utilities in the
water and roads sectors. However, the country context remains volatile and uncertain,
with the withdrawal of international peace keeping troops in 2014.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance (relating to design,
implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory



                                           22
55.     The Project’s design failed to be selective and focused on upgrading, and included
components that were not critical to the achievement of the PDOs and were ultimately
dropped 51 . Institutional risks, country context risks, as well as risks posed by
components to be financed by other donors, were not adequately anticipated and created
significant challenges during implementation

56.     There was no QAE assessment for KURP. The Project was prepared and
approved within a short span of time, but project management capacity was not in place
to manage preparation of bids for works. During preparation, activities involving
significant amount of co-financing were included in the design without adequate risk
mitigation measures that could counter the unavailability of donor funds. While “housing?
which implied a broader policy agenda was dropped just before Appraisal based on the
rationale that other donors were financing it, other components did not benefit from an
extension of the same rationale. For example, the component on land tenure
regularization created enormous complexity and high transaction costs for the Bank and
the Client. Until components not fully funded from the Credit proceeds were dropped,
task team supervision resources were diluted, in fact severely stretched. In January 2009,
the Bank Team finally recommended cancellation of the land tenure regularization
component.

57.     Design shortcomings notwithstanding, the implementation of urban upgrading in
Kabul have unequivocally and positively impacted the opposition at the local and
national level to service improvements in informal and unplanned areas. Visible results
of service delivery improvements have demonstrated the viability of urban upgrading as a
relevant intervention in Afghanistan’s urban context for integration of underserved
residential areas into the main fabric of the city.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

58.    The Bank’s performance during supervision is rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
There were 21 missions, which is higher than the Bank standard average of two missions
per year. The Bank Task Team supervised the Project three times a year for the first five
years with a high degree of commitment and dedication, but without consistent support
from experienced Bank staff. The Team struggled to resolve implementation challenges
posed by the lack of a dedicated PMU and TA, keeping Bank management informed.
There were no changes in task management until the Project was restructured in 2010.
Immediately thereafter there was a high degree of turnover of Task Team Leaders



51
   At PCN stage, the project was even more complex. The Bank cleared inclusion of additional cities in the
project, as well as technical studies for assessing the feasibility of housing grants and mechanisms for the
provision of serviced land.




                                                    23
(TTLs), but there has been a resident TTL in Kabul soon after restructuring for the last
two years, providing close implementation support to the client.           Supervision
performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory because the Bank was too slow to
restructure the Project when the MTR made clear the need for restructuring - the DCA
was amended two years after the MTR.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

59.     The Project started performing after substantial delays.       Implementation
bottlenecks which are partly caused by design shortcomings were overtaken in later
stages with better management of Project implementation and revision of targets. By the
time of the ICR, the Project had surpassed the revised targets. However, despite the
difficult country context and the Project team’s continuous engagement with the client,
the challenges of finding experienced task managers to locate in Kabul, Bank
performance is considered moderately unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

60.     Political instability and changes in leadership at the client end were another factor
that led to implementation delays. Senior level leadership changes in MoF and MoUD in
2004 and 2006 respectively caused significant delays in securing co-financing 52. There
were substantial delays in securing co-financing and procurement of TA. At the time of
negotiations for KURP, the Government had ensured TAFSU support of $3.2 million
with the understanding that the remainder funds from ARTF would be allocated once
procurement contracts were initiated. Due to a difference in opinion between the MoF
and MoUDA, it took unusually long for acceptance of contract proposals and
authorization of payments to contractors which led to delays. During implementation,
some contract invoices were not paid in a timely manner due to budget allotment issues
that took time to resolve between MoUDA and MoF.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

61.    MoUDA supported implementation of Project activities through regular guidance
and supervision. Significant progress was achieved by the PMU in overcoming the
hurdles of procurement contracting and quality record keeping. The Project established
strong relationships with the community members which resulted in ownership of the

Project by the beneficiaries. It is expected that future urban development projects will
receive similar level of acceptance from the beneficiaries.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

62.      The overall borrower performance is rated as moderately satisfactory considering
the operational bottlenecks that significantly delayed procurement of consultants for
implementation of different components under the Project. Delays in critically needed
TA and Project management support created a delay of almost two years in the start-up
activities under the Project. Once the TA was in place and a dedicated and well-staffed
PMU established under MoUDA, the Project’s performance improved systematically
over the subsequent years. The PMU continued its credibility with the beneficiary
communities throughout the Project and helped in resolving conflicts that could have
impeded progress. Performance of the PMU has been satisfactory in terms of contracts
management and supervision of civil works.

6. Lessons Learned

63.      Project design for post-conflict reconstruction should be kept simple and oriented
towards the immediate and urgent reconstruction needs. While longer term objectives
should be kept in mind and considered during Project preparation, components not on the
critical path of achieving the PDOs should be excluded to avoid implementation risks that
are created due to a lack of exercising selectivity during the design stage. A lack of
selectivity often leads to the involvement of multiple agencies which makes coordination
difficult even under normal circumstances and furthermore challenges the limited
capacity of newly established Project units in implementing agencies. Project
implementation experience in Afghanistan as well as in other fragile and conflict affected
countries has demonstrated that activities co-financed by other donors does not
necessarily yield the intended results and should not be included as part a Project, but
remain complementary. If donor aid is delivered off-budget, the Borrower has little or no
control on the content, sequencing, or quality of activities delivered by donors thereby
affecting Project performance if included as part of the Project.

64.     Urban upgrading in Afghanistan is a viable approach and community
participation is critical. Upgrading was a new concept introduced by the KURP and
ultimately gained broad acceptance. The Project succeeded in changing the mindset of
perceiving unplanned settlements as "illegal" to recognizing their legitimacy and
improving living conditions of people in such settlements. Community participation has
proven crucial to make upgrading work, including highlighting the critical role of
including women representatives and marginalized groups in the participation process.
The policy of having at least half of the Gozar Cooperating Shuras members to be
women was critical to its success. While technical and engineering consultants are
needed to work with these community groups in developing the plans with technical
details such as drawings, the community groups should make the key decisions regarding
level of services, design of complaint handling mechanisms and agreement on O&M
responsibilities, costs and financing.

                                            25
65.     Capacity constraints in both the public sector and the private sector in post-
conflict environments are considerable.           Bank support delivered as emergency
operations within in a compressed time schedule usually will not allow time for effective
capacity building activities to be delivered before Projects are effective. Capacity
building activities can be delivered only after Projects become effective and resources are
available. Considerably more allowances therefore needs to be made at the design stage
for capacity building of public sector agencies in the technical, procurement, financial
management and safeguard aspects of Bank Projects. Implementation periods also need
to be assessed realistically. Private sector capacity, including in the construction industry
is also limited in post-conflict environments and delivering capacity building activities
for private sector firms also needs to be an integral part of the Project’s design. Bank’s
criteria for procurement, (e.g. qualification criteria), should be defined in a way that is
suitable to the condition of the local market.

66.     Projects in post-conflict environments must either include higher contingency
costs than is normal or set aside about 20% of the funds as unallocated funds, as post-
conflict environments are uncertain and volatile. In a country like Afghanistan, where
most construction materials are imported, implementation periods need to be realistic as
supply chains of goods and construction materials are often disrupted for protracted
periods of time. Costs in such environments tend to be higher and there is considerable
price volatility. TA and implementation support costs are also likely to be much higher,
because of lower competition. Supervision costs are also likely to be higher because
unforeseen security related events can stall the work schedule of contractors, creating an
additional challenge for contract management.

67.     The presence of a field-based task-team leader (TTL) is of utmost importance in
contexts such as Afghanistan. In conflict countries with significant capacity constraints,
the presence of country-based TTL to provide intensive implementation support is crucial
for timely achievement of Project results.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

68.    This ICRR acknowledges the concern raised by the Borrower about inadequate
due diligence during appraisal and reliance on co-financed activities which delayed
implementation. The Project was designed as an emergency operation, allowing little
time to complete the preparation necessary for infrastructure Projects. As the first urban
Project in Afghanistan, implementation has provided significant lessons for future
engagement in the sector.

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component A: Area Upgrading

69.     As part of KURP, 19 gozars within KM’s jurisdiction were selected for area
upgrading to improve basic tertiary and trunk infrastructure, e.g. access, water supply &
sanitation, drainage, solid waste management and street lighting. A pilot gozar included
four upgrading contracts, for which procurement was completed by 2008.

70.     The detail Surveying, Planning, engineering design and construction supervision
for the upgrading works was carried out through the PD&C. All upgrading works were
implemented by local contractors procured through the World Bank procurement
procedures for National Competitive Bidding (NCB).

71.     Planning and design work was undertaken in two pilot gozars over a six month
period from April–September, 2006 by interim consultants engaged directly by the PMU.
Engineering drawings and BoQ’s were prepared and packaged into three contracts which
were tendered in November 2006. However, no responsive bids were received during the
first round which resulted in re-advertisement for the first three packages in early
February, 2007. Successful rebidding was a key achievement for KURP, as a number of
improvements were made and responsive bids were received for all three packages
thereafter. The improvements started with some adjustments to the bidding documents
which included bid security declaration, relaxations to the post qualification criteria as
per the new World Bank standard NCB works document for Afghanistan and
improvement to the EMP, specifications and Qa/Qc Manual which formed part of the bid
document.

72.     The MoUDA with assistance from the PMU and the TSU, appointed two PD&C
consultants, namely Cooperation for Reconstruction of Afghanistan (CRA) for package
one, and Arkane Foncier for package two. The PD&Cs were expected to have community
consultation, engineering design, construction supervision and contract management
skills. Shortly after signing the contracts, both consultants mobilized & started work in
late December, 2006. Both consultants had 24 months contracts that were scheduled to
be completed by December 2008. But the PD&C contract for package 2 with Gross
Allain (Arkane Foncier) was cancelled on 1st July 2009, due to nonperformance.
Subsequently, the PMU hired individual consultants directly to oversee the supervision of
civil works package. The PD&C contract package with CRA, which was scheduled to
expire on December 2008, was extended up to June 2010 to allow completion of the
supervision and reporting activities. Total disbursements under Component A (not
including consultancy cost of design and supervision of works) are in the table below.

Component B: Land Tenure Regularization Component:

73.     A Land Tenure Technical Committee (LTTC) comprised of representatives from
stakeholders from various agencies was expected to be convened by appointing
international consultants who would provide leadership. However, the component was
dropped at restructuring due to slow progress.

Component C, D & E (Capacity Building Components):

74.     In spite of the implementation impediments on account of procurement and FM
difficulties, technical and managerial skills of PMU staff improved with extensive
training imparted by the TSU in different fields such as finance, procurement, short and
long term AutoCAD, GIS, etc. Given the scale and diversity of planned and unplanned
neighborhoods in 6 districts of KM that have been upgraded under KURP, considerable
technical knowledge on infrastructure costs has been generated. This is being
synthesized by the KURP PMU to be published as a guide for Kabul and other cities in
Afghanistan.

                          Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

75.    Analysis for economic rate of return was not undertaken at the time of Appraisal,
as, without a PMU in place, baseline data on expected benefits from upgrading
investments was not available. Data was only collected during implementation between
2006 and 2009, gozar by gozar, for developing community upgrading plans but lacked
the kind of data that would normally be collected for computing economic benefits.
However, international experience highlights that the range of the EIRRs found in other
urban upgrading projects around the world are high. Some of the lowest rates may be as
low as 4%, while some of the highest EIRRs may be as high as 94.1% (see table below).
This ICRR was not able to conduct a robust economic analysis 55, but with over 96% of
the Credit proceeds allocated for upgrading, EIRR can be safely assumed to be
reasonable to justify the investment (see paragraph below).

                     Range of EIRR based on International Comparisons

                              Projects                                               ERR

     Venezuela’s Caracas slum upgrading (according to changes                          94.11%
                     in housing values per m2)

76.     The Project’s investments were targeted to settlements most vulnerable and
deficient in basic municipal services. Vulnerability was measured as the ratio of income
earners vs. dependents and years of living in Kabul. The primary criterion for lack of
services was measured by the lack of access to; (i) piped water supply, (ii) in-house well,
(iii) public well and (iv) tanker. Sanitation deficiencies were measured by (i) the absence
of in-house facilities, (ii) disposal of night soil, (iii) improvements in latrines. While the
benefits of delivering this basic package of urban services would be high in keeping with
the benefits well documented from international experience, they could not be quantified
in terms of improvements in health, incidence of disease, lost work or school days,

   The Bank’s Investment Lending Reforms approved by the Board on October 25, 2012, includes an
updated approach to economic analysis of IL operations that continues to provide the needed rigor of this
mandatory requirement while allowing the use of a methodology appropriate for the specific operation,
taking into account country and sectoral considerations.

reduced travel time and transport costs, increase in real estate values upon provision of
public goods etc. 56.

77.     The stakeholder assessment conducted by the PMU estimated the number of
direct beneficiaries to be more than 248,000 (an increase over the142,215 beneficiaries
recorded during the census surveys between 2007-2009), and the total number of indirect
beneficiaries between 0.7-1 million, both because of the benefits reported during focus
group discussions in the neighboring gozars and improvements to trunk infrastructure.
The Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with beneficiaries identified several positive
impacts, some of which are listed below:
      •    Easier access to clinics, school or hospitals.
      •    Savings accruing from reduction in expenditure on clothes and shoes due to less
           dirty roads.
      •    Access to facilities such as markets has become easier.
      •    Transport costs have reduced and time savings accrued to daily wage earner and
           other professionals. This is because people can walk to places where they
           previously had to take a taxi because of difficult terrain, and also taxis presently
           charge less to come to the upgraded areas now that roads are paved.
      •    Healthier environment due to regular removal of waste.
      •    Ability of residents to socialize together has increased and it has become easier to
           hold community events such as weddings.
      •    Children do not fall sick often.
      •    Income opportunities for small shopkeepers have increased.

Expenditure Efficiency:
78.     The ICR Team found several internal documents that alluded to high unit costs
for upgrading and project management. An analysis and detailed review of technical
standards for roads and drains (84% of infrastructure investments under KURP),
engineering estimates and final costs, was undertaken, both for this ICR and to get a
better understanding of engineering estimates and final costs to enable planning for the
future. This analysis shows that the costs of the roads (predominantly secondary and
tertiary roads, footpaths, and hillside steps) completed under the KURP are comparable to
the costs of the roads executed under other projects. For instance, the cost of the roads
executed under the JICA funded Kabul Solidarity Program (KPS) which is in the nascent
stage, are estimated at $16 per sqm which is in line with KURP’s average costs.

79.     The ICR Team also sought to better understand project management costs: The
total anticipated Project cost at the time of appraisal was US$ 52 million including
approximately US$ 22 57 million to be provided by bi-lateral donors that was ultimately


56
   International experience with urban upgrading shows that every US$1 invested by the public sector in
slums, leverages US$7 of private investment indicating that one of the main benefits arising from slum
upgrading is from enhanced private sector economic activity due to improved physical environment

If funds provided from TAFS (ARTF TF 50970), i.e. US$ 3.2 million are included
(although the execution of these funds was not done by KURP), then the available funds
increase to US$ 33.8 million. The expenditure efficiency of the Project by funding

80.     Total expenditure on PD&C consultants is estimated to be approximately
US$ 9.04 million or 27% of the total expenditures on works. This is higher than the
norm of 18% to 20% of actual civil works being allocated for design and supervision of
works, as it includes the cost of community mobilization and organization. One of the
major contracts for a PD&C consultant firm was funded through the ARTF TF Grant #
50970. The cost of the PMU (not including the costs of the international consulting firms
that provided technical assistance) was US$0.6 million, approximately 2% of total
Project expenses. This is low when compared to project management costs under other
Bank supported projects which typically range from 3% to 7%, often as high as 10% for
projects that are very transaction intensive, for example social fund projects. In contexts
such as Afghanistan, security related threats create a premium that leads to higher than
normal consulting contract costs. Higher costs for PD&C consultants and other
construction consultants can be justified with respect to the contingencies associated with
implementing Project activities in Afghanistan. A lot of uncertainty in Afghanistan exists
due to cost of material as the construction industry is highly import dependent, and
security conditions exacerbate the uncertainty and cause disruptions to deliveries and
schedules – these cumulatively contribute to higher costs, about 30% higher than costs in
the region. Under KURP, the cost of urban upgrading (Component A) increased by 60%
in 2006 at the start of civil works and in 2009 including due the unknown technical
factors at the time of Appraisal, with additional increases by more than 14 percent. For
financial contingencies associated with inflation and other macroeconomic imbalances,
suitable measures relevant to post-conflict environments should be incorporated in the
Project design.

     Annex 5 & 6. Beneficiary Survey Results & Stakeholder Workshop Report

80.     While a baseline survey for each gozar was undertaken during preparation of the
Community Upgrading plans, no survey was done at completion. However, a beneficiary
assessment was done in February-March 2012 just prior to the closing of the Project. .
KURP has resulted in a much higher level of satisfaction than other donor Projects in
Afghanistan. Major benefits expressed by targeted communities are 58 : (1) Increased
mobility and access to clinics, schools, hospitals, markets etc. (2) Improved social
integration and reduced cost of transportation. Transportation has become cheaper either
because people can walk to places they previously had to take taxis to, or because the
taxis charge less to come to the area now that roads are paved. (3) Reduced expenditure
on clothes and shoes that do not have to be washed frequently and replaced as the
environment is less dusty. (4) Saved time by women on washing of clothes and cleaning,
and (5) Improvement in children’s health.

Social Issues and Results of Beneficiary Assessment

81.    KURP conducted broad consultation with Project beneficiaries and stakeholders
and involved them in development of Community Upgrading Plan (CUP) and Project
implementation arrangements. Participation of beneficiaries in KURP, particularly in
planning, budgeting, and monitoring was made mandatory to ensure community voices
be heard and their opinion included in the Project planning.

82.      KURP facilitated the establishment of elected community councils called gozar
Cooperating Shura (GCSs)? in order to represent each gozar for KURP activities.
Although KURP, unlike the National Solidarity Program for the rural areas, was not
formally mandated to develop local-level, democratic and inclusive representative bodies,
an abbreviated methodology to this effect was in fact developed in response to the
requirements of community participation in KURP. Once KURP gozars were selected,
each gozar was divided into clusters of 20-50 households, and each cluster selected a
representative to send to the Gozar Cooperative Shura (GCS). The methods for selecting
GCS members were locally sensitive, either using secret ballot voting for a choice of
candidates, or election through consensus at a community meeting, by show of hands.
The GCS were partly inspired by the rural CDCs and partly by UNHABITAT’s efforts in
urban areas. KURP developed draft bye-laws for the GCS, as well as a Grievance
Redressal Mechanism and a comprehensive Community Consultation Manual, ensuring
community participation a vital role in all aspect of all aspects of the Project. Donors are
using both the Grievance Redress Mechanism and the Community Consultation Manual
as illustrations/models for other Projects in the country.

83.    An important aspect of KURP’s participatory approach was its success in
involving women. In view of the prevalent social norms it was found that gender

segregated representation increased women’s active engagement, and women were
represented in their own separate GCS Shuras. Throughout the Project, special efforts
were made to ensure female participation during the entire KURP process and according
to the finding of CUP reports half of the GCSs members are female. Women played an
overall very active role in KURP and were among its strongest community supporters. In
several cases, community disputes related to KURP upgrading were only resolved by the
intervention and active mediation undertaken by the women of the gozar. KURP thus
effectively laid the groundwork for community representation and active participation in
local-level decision making in the urban setting in Afghanistan

84.     KURP’s success in community participation had a direct impact on its ability to
manage social safeguards issues. No formal land acquisition was anticipated or funded
under KURP and where ever minor land requirements appeared in connection with the
upgrading of roads, water supply or other interventions, the community members
resolved the issues through negotiations. As a result, some community members were
convinced to relocate their latrines from the right of way, while in other instances larger
or smaller community compensation for affected people were agreed upon, where the
affected households were unable or unwilling to donate minor pieces of land for
upgrading work. KURP maintained full documentation of these processes and the efforts
are reflected in the Highly Satisfactory social safeguards rating – and the use of KURP
case materials as examples of Good Practices in-country safeguards training modules.

85.     In 2008, KURP conducted baseline a knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP)
survey on hygiene and sanitation in four selected gozars. A total of 240 household
surveys (120 male and 120 female respondents) and 32 FGDs were undertaken in the
selected gozars, which were chosen to represent the varied characteristics of: location,
geography, ethnicity and socio-economic status across Kabul. The findings of the survey
was shared with other agencies in the sector and used to inform KURP training module
on health and hygiene. KURP also conducted FGDs and household surveys with men
and women to include their views in the EIA/SIA developed for the old city gozars.

                        Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR

86.     The Project is considered successful. The target communities participated in
Project implementation and benefitted from significant improvement in their health,
economic position, and general living standards. The Project also generated awareness in
non-target communities. The beneficiaries gained higher levels of skills in managing
their own works communally, and the Project had a positive impact on women’s
empowerment and provided them with active roles in the community. Project design and
processes were successful with a few exceptions. Moreover, the receipt of some
applications and requests for the Project to be implemented in different areas of the city
shows the respect and admiration that city residents have for the Project’s achievements.
It is worth mentioning that all the lessons learned while implementing KURP should be
considered essential for the design of the future Project.

Lessons Learnt under KURP:

87.     An important distinction of community participation must be made. Participatory
approach to empower communities to implement the Project is different from the
participatory approach that aims at community empowerment to achieve sustainability.

88.     Systematic community upgrading also requires a systematic approach to Project
design and implementation arrangements. Without understanding the socio-economic
classification of targeted population within each gozar or across gozars, cost effective
and affordable solutions cannot be designed for community participation.

89.   Piloting within a pilot Project not only offers an opportunity for building trust
with communities, but also is an opportunity to improve procedures and Project
implementation modalities.

90.    Coordination among agencies should begin at the Project preparation stage with
consensus on Project design principles and their enforcement during the implementation
stage. Memorandum of Understanding could be signed for smooth operational
coordination.

91.   In an environment of political instability, reliance on counterpart funds for Project
implementation adds a significant risk to Project implementation.

92.    Project preparation should focus on building improved in-house capacities in
procurement and financial management for sustained future engagements with the Bank.

93.     The Bank’s management must oversee that the turnover of Task Team Leaders
throughout the implementation period does not disrupt continuity of the Bank’s support
to the Client.
