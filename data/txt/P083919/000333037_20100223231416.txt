A.     Introduction

1.      This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to introduce the
following changes in the Afghanistan Kabul Urban Reconstruction Project (the "project
", IDA Credit 3967, Project ID P083919) and accompanying amendments to the project's
legal documents.

2.      The proposed changes address challenges resulting from unrealistic project
development objectives and complex project design, which were the result of an attempt
to combine emergency response to improve delivery of basic urban services in Kabul
Municipality (KM) with long tenn capacity development goals in a difficult country and
sector environment. Changes are also required to address significant cost overruns and a
subsequent funding gap. The proposed restructuring would modifY the project's
development objectives to focus on improving delivery of basic urban service, reduce
project scope, and scale back project outcomes. The project restructuring will be
accompanied by a second one-year extension of credit closing date from March 31, 2010
to March 31, 2011, to enable completion of the area upgrading works as per the
restructured project.

B.     Background and Reasons for Restructuring

3.       Background. On July 29, 2004, IDA's Board of Executive Directors approved
an IDA credit (Cr. 3967) of SDR 17.1 million (US$25 million equivalent) for the Kabul
Urban Reconstruction Project; the credit became effective on August 5, 2004. The
project's original development objectives were to "assist the borrower in improving
capacity of the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Kabul Municipality (KM)
in urban management and supporting the integration of selected neighborhoods into the
urban fabric of KM through reconstruction and rehabilitation of urban services and
facilities. "The project received grant funding of US$ 2.7 million from the Technical
Assistance and Feasibility Studies Facility (funded by ARTF) in March 2006 and an
ARTF grant ofUS$ 5.6 million (TF 92073) in May 2008.

4.     The original project scope comprises six components:

Part A: Area Upgrading in Kabul: This component addressed area upgrading of poor,
infrastructure deficient, planned and unplanned neighborhoods, following a participatory
process involving the respective community groups.

Part B: Land Tenure Regularization aimed at developing an appropriate methodology and
capacity to regularize urban land tenure in Kabul through pilots implementation.

Part C: Engineering and Management Support to Urban Agencies to manage the Kabul
Urban Reconstruction Project.

Part D: Overall Capacity Building for Kabul Municipality was to support Kabul
Municipality in improving its finance function, including revenue generation, financial
management, asset management, budgeting and planning.
Part E: Preparation of Structure Plans and a Future Urban Project was to assist the MoUD
and at least five municipalities I with preparation of physical development plans and
investment programs, building capacity in planning in the MoUD and the municipalities,
and the institutionalization of a planning process in the municipalities.

Part F: Main Roads, Drainages and Traffic Management in KabuL

5.       Project implementation challenges encountered. At the time of the project
preparation and approval, the Bank's urban engagement in Afghanistan had been
minimal. The project was prepared under OP 8.50 as an emergency project. However,
the project development objectives were unduly ambitious, mixing short term
infrastructure upgrading with medium/long term capacity building goals in an extremely
fragile post-conflict country setting. Project design and implementation arrangements
were overly complex, reflecting a lack of knowledge of the sector setting, overestimation
of the capacity of the implementing agencies and their commitment and ownership of the
project.

6.      The project performance was affected by 24 months of project start-up delays
resulting from borrower's insistence on securing grant funding (instead of using credit
proceeds) for project management and technical support consultants. As a result, the
project suffered procurement delays due the initially weak project management capacity
of the implementing agencies.

7.      Upgrading of poorly serviced neighborhoods in Kabul only began in April 2007,
30 months after the Board approval. By 2008, it was clear that (a) the project's original
deVelopment objectives were unrealistic and unachievable ; (b) project activities under
Parts B, D and E of the project were not aligned with the country's emergency
reconstruction priorities or not feasible to implement due to a lack of client ownership
and commitment , and (c) there were significant cost overruns with regard to the civil
works for the neighborhood upgrading component, necessitating a reduction of scope
and output targets for Part A of the project [the original project costing for Part A (civil
works) was undertaken in March 2004, since then, costs of civil works have increased
significantly from an initial estimate of US$] 7,500 per ha in 2004 to US$32, 000 per ha
in 2009].

8.     Reasons for restructuring. The project restructuring is required to address the
challenges mentioned above and refocus the project's objective on improving delivery
of basic urban services in selected neighborhoods, and to reduce project scope and
output targets accordingly.

C.     Proposed Changes

9.    Revised Project Development Objective: to upgrade urban infrastructure to
improve the delivery of basic urban services in under- serviced communities in Kabul
Municipality.



                                             2
10.  . Changes in Scope/Output Targets

Part A: Area Upgrading. The original activities planned for this component and
implementation approach remain unchanged. The project will continue to support service
delivery in the selected neighborhoods for: water supply, sanitation, solid waste
management, roads, drains and street lighting. The scope and outputs targets will be
reduced as follows:
(i) a reduction in the targeted number of neighborhoods from 45 to 16;

(ii) a reduction in the targeted number of beneficiaries from 250,000 to 92,000; and

(iii) a reduction in the targeted number of hectares for upgrading from 1,000 to 600 ha.

Part B: Land Tenure Regularization will be cancelled.

Part C: Engineering and Management Support will be modified to drop support to the
Afghan Cartography Office.

Part D: Capacity Building of Kabul Municipality will be modified to "assisting the Kabul
Municipality to improve its accounting system through the provision of training,
equipment and software ".

Part E will be modified to "assisting Kabul Municipality to prepare a Municipal Plan
through the provision of technical advisory services and training ".

Part F: Main Roads, Drainages and Traffic Management in Kabul will be cancelled as it
is now financed in a separate, self standing project.

The revised project results framework is in Attachment 1 to the Project Paper.

11.     Extension of credit closing date. The project restructuring will be accompanied
by a second one-year extension of credit closing date from March 31, 2010 to March 31,
2011, to enable completion of the area upgrading works as per the restructured project.

12.    Implementation Arrangements. Implementation arrangements would largely
remain unchanged. However, as a result of the reduced project scope, the following
adjustments will be made:

(i)  References to the Project Support Team (PST) in the Kabul Municipality will be
     dropped as coordination with KM is mostly managed though the Planning Team and
     the Municipal technical departments;

(ii)  The Land Tenure Technical Committee is not longer required;

(iii) The borrower should ensure one financial officer with qualifications and experience
     acceptable to IDA is available to the project on a full time basis to coordinate and
     oversee the Project's financial management and disbursement aspects.

D.      Analysis

14.     The proposed changes will not have significant effect on the original aspects of
the Area Upgrading in Kabul component as appraised except for changes in outcome
targets. The environment category remains unchanged and there are no exceptions to
Bank Policy.

15.     Overall implementation of the area upgrading is now proceeding steadily. Out of
total 30 works packages in the procurement plan for the restructured project, works are
complete for 11 packages; contracts have been awarded for 14 packages financed by the
IDA credit; 5 packages co-financed by ARTF TF92073 are at advanced stages of
procurement. Implementation of the reduced project components D and E has been
completed. The project has no overdue financial audits.

E.     PROJECT RISKS

16.     Based on the project implementation status, the major challenges facing the
project are to (a) mitigate completion slippage for the 14 works contracts under
implementation; (b) mitigate procurement delays for the five works packages in
procurement process; and (c) address the concerns of communities as a result of reduced
scope of the area upgrading component. During the December 2009 supervision, actions
to mitigate completion slippages for area upgrading works were agreed with the
implementing agencies. Considering the age of the ongoing project and reflecting on the
lessons learned, it is proposed that further support for scaling up area upgrading activities
in the Kabul Municipality be considered through a follow-on operation.
