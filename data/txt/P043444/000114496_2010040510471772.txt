or exceeding DEM 6,000,000.

shall be made as follows:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the Borrower 
shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for deposit into the 
Special Account of an amount or amounts which do not exceed the aggregate 
amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or 
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the 
Loan Account and deposit into the Special Account such amount or amounts 
as the Borrower shall have requested.
(b)
(i)
For replenishment of the Special Account, the 
Borrower shall furnish to the 
Bank requests for deposits 
into the Special Account at such intervals as the

Schedule for the payment or payments in respect of which replenishment is

equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized Allocation.  Thereafter, 
withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining unwithdrawn amount of 
the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories shall follow such

further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the 
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit 
in the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in 
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.

If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any

provided such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may 
be.

amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to cover 
further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly
