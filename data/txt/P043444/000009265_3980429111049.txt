INTRODUCTION
At the request of the Croatian Government, the World Bank and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in close
cooperation with HBOR, are developing the project "Municipal
Environmental Infrastructure Investment Program".
The nature and size of the investment part of the project, as well as its
potential environmental impacts require, according to the Croatian
environmental regulations and those of the participating banks, to
carrying out of an environmental assessment. The project has been
ranked as category "A" for the purpose of the World Bank Operational
Directive O.D. 4.01, which means that a full environmental
assessment study is required before banks can approve the project for
its financing.
The study area for the assessment consists of the drainage area to be
serviced by the wastewater collection system; the tracts of land on
which effluent to be applied in reuse systems; marine and estuarine
waters which could be influenced by effluent discharge; remote sites
identified for disposal of solid waste generated in the treatment
process, and watershed which might be affected.
OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
The environmental assessment study is being developed to: (i) assess
potential environmental consequences of the potential project
alternatives; (ii) help guide the design of the proposed project's
alternative to minimize any potential negative environmental impacts
which might occur during construction and operation, and (iii) to
formulate recommendations concerning measures that should be
undertaken in order to maintain conditions for the protection of the
marine enviromnent in the area.
This study with its recommendations will be the basis for applying for
an environmental permit from the regional authorities.

1. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
1.1. INTRODUCTION
This study deals with the wider area of the Kastela Bay that covers the municipalities of Split,
Solin, Kastela and Trogir. This region represents a unique economic and territorial complex
whose segments are closely bound to each other and to the city of Split as a dominating center
which is why it is referred to as the region of Split. This region is situated in the central part of
the Croatian littoral and the entire region belongs to the County of Split and Dalmatia (Fig. 1. 1.).
The city of Split is the main center of the wider area of the Kastela Bay and also the capital of
the mentioned County. Within the system of industrial centres within the Republic of Croatia
Split is referred to as a category 2 centre while within the system of tourist activities it bears a
category I title.
In the year of 1981 the region of Split had a population of 466.567. The estimated population
until 2015 is approx. 530.000. In 1991 Split, Solin, Kastela and Trogir had a population of
266.118, and the estimated population in 2015 is 355.000. This region covers an area of approx.
14.500 hectares.
It has been known for a rather long time that the area of Kastela Bay has been one of the most
polluted areas in the Adriatic. It has also been known that efforts have been made in trying to
solve this problem. The problem, however occurred as a result of intensive construction and
industrialization on a rather small area. Within all this, through a long period of time, the basic
municipal infrastucture - sewerage system was omitted. Therefore, the solution to this problem
cannot be expected so soon. This problem has become wider by scope, more complex in the
technical way, and too heavy economically which are the reasons why it cannot be solved
quickly and easily.
The region of Split that covers towns such as Solin, Kastela and Trogir greatly developed and
became urbanized in the post-war period. In the last forty years the population grew three times
as much so that in 1953 it had about 109.000 inhabitants, presently about 300.000. Along with
the increase of population, industry, traffic and trade developed as well. Split is the largest
traffic, industrial, commercial and administrative centre of Dalmatia with a strong tendency of
growing in the future. Unfortunately, town planning, construction and particularly industry was
directed onto the area of Kastela Bay (Fig. 1 1.) so that this rather small surface with restricted
capacities is already greatly devastated and polluted.
Throughout this period, the intensive construction of residential and industrial buildings was not
in relation to the construction of the sewerage infrastructure. As a result of this a greater part of
this region does not have a unique and complete sewerage system. The area of Trogir, Kastela
and Solin has no sewerage system so that the greatest part of wastewater is collected in septic
tanks. The wastewater is either directly or indirectly without treatment drained into the coastal
sea. Regarding the sewerage system the area of the city of Split enjoys a somewhat better
situation, but even here all the wastewater is either directly or indirectly drained into the coastal
sea.

Such level of urban construction, concentration of traffic and industry adds to the pollution of
air, land and particularly the sea as a recipient of the entire pollution of the corresponding
catchment area. The unexacting necessary infrastructure increases the dangerous environmental
impact up to a level where the environment could affect future development or even cause
regression .of the achieved level of development It can be said of the wider area of Split that is
facing an ecological crisis, because it is experiencing all levels of development and crisis impact,
from pollution over negative impact to destruction. Certain environmental elements can still bear
this while others are affected to such an extent that their ability to cope is reduced. Unfortunately
there are also environmental elements that are destroyed to such extent that they cannot be
restored. Year after year, this situation causes an increasing quantity of destroyed natural
environment, simultaneously reducing the unaffected elements. It is entirely up to the inhabitants
of this area whether this trend will continue in the future, and it is up to them to stop this
negative trend of environmental pollution.
One of the main prerequisites for solving this problem is the construction of a sewerage system,
a treatment plant and wastewater disposal plant The topic is very complex, and the ways of
solving it are rather hard and confusing. The study brings a description of the solution to the
problem, a long-term concept of the sewerage system of the wider area of the Kastela Bay,
phases of its construction as well as part of the system whose construction will be financed by
the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

12. EXISTING STATE OF SEWERAGE SYSTEM
In the studied area, the greatest part of the sewerage system was built only in Split, and approx.
70% of the population is connected onto the sewerage. Speaking in tenns of surface, only 55%
of the urban area of Split has its sewerage system. The total length of the sewerage system of
Split is approx. 202 km. The sewerage system in Solin,, Kastela and Trogir was partly
constructed, i.e. the part in the town nucleus. Approximately 25% of the population is connected
onto the sewerage system. The total length of the Solin sewerage system is approx. 13 km,
Kastela - 31 kn and Trogir - 16 km. Other buildings bave their septic tanks.
Neither the entire -area nor these towns individually have a umique sewerage system. Not even
Split. The existing sewerage system was built mostly in the city nucleus, and as the city grew
larger the sewerage system grew accordingly. However, the system did not increase as a unique
sewerage system. It may rather be considered as separate subsystems that accumulate wastewater
on a smaller area i drain it where the wastewater is drained inlto the coastal sea. Because of this,
the area has more than several hundred of separate outfalls into the sea (Fig. 1.2). This
practically means that this area has no wastewater treatment, plants, neither partly mechanical
ones. Of all the outfalls that were built in accordance with the professional standards, those that
should be mentioned are: the Podstrana outfall, the Lav Hoitel outfall, the Split airport outfall
and the Medena Hotel outfall. The largest outfall in Split is the one at Katalinid& brig which has
not been in use in the past few years due to the malfunctioningy of the pump station. The southern
part of Split, i.e. the wider area of Bacvice is connected onto this outfall.
In accordance with the aforementioned it may be concluded that Split has an incomplete
sewerage system while other towns practically have none at all The sewerage system of Split is
mostly a combined-type system, while only the segment built in the past ten years was built as a
separate one (Fig. 1.3.). The sewerage system of Split is as old as the city itself, i.e. built before
1700 years. In the Diocletian Palace there is a unique sewerage system that remained very well
preserved until the present. Presently, works are carried out so that it will be able to function
properly. The sewerage system was built as the city grew larger, so that the city nucleus bears
remains of cross-sections of the sewerage system, although it was not until the period between
the wars that greater sewers were built
The city saw its most intense development in the post-war years so that it may be said that a
more serious construction of the sewerage system did not begin until then. Unfortunately, due to
short-term economic interests and an incorrect approach to the assessment of the capacity of the
coastl sea, a combined-type sewerage system was foreseen. This was common practice in the
Mediterranean that foresaw outfall of part of the wastewater into the sea by means of long
submarine outfalls and only partial mechanical treatment. The result of such practice was a
concentration of all wastewater and rainwater in the centre of the city, i.e. at Katalini6a brig,
where the mechanical plant and outfall was foreseen and where the first phase of the outfall was
built All overflow water was supposed to be drained into the coastal sea, the greater part of
which (approx. 60%) into the Split port, which makes 80% of'the entire annual pollution.

In accordance with the aforementioned and also with the topographic characteristics of the
region, presently all the wastewater of the southern part of Split and partly the northern part is
concentrated in the city port where it is drained into the sea in the area of Vranjic. This has the
greatest affect on regular mortality of fisb during the summer. As the planned sewerage system
did not foresee any plants (except partly mechanical ones) the area near the outfalls became
urbanized so that there are is no way of erecting any quality wastewater treatment plant in theses
areas. Altogether this led to a very complicated situation regarding the sewerage system,
treatment plant and submarine outfalls that should be solved on a long-term basis. The present
situation could be solved in a much easier way in Solin, Kastela and Trogir because a separate
system was partly built and because the sewerage system was not built yet. The newly
constructed one would therefore be much easier to design and it would also be less restricted by
the existing systern.
Due to the situation that occurred in the past few years, sewerage systems were built very
intensively. Presently under construction are:
a) the one on the area of the city of Split; the main sewer in the city port, the corresponding
treatment plant (mechanical) and pump station, and a connection onto the existing submarine
outfall as well as the reconstruction of the existing sewerage system on that area.
b) the one on the area of the town of Solin; the main pump station Solin with corresponding
transmission mains bearing in mind that part of the main system has already been built.
c) the one on the area of the town of Kastela; the sewerage system and pump station of the first
phase of the sewerage system that covers K. Sucurac and K. Gomilica.
As result of such situation a big quantities of pollutant have been discharged in to Kastela bay
directly from sewerage system or indirectly by hydrological cycle or local water resources. In
accordance with result of the study /3/ total biological oxygen demand load and suspended solids
load of the Kaktela bay was:

Figures for the year of 2000 and up are given on the basis of the trend from the past, while
figures for the year of 2015 are taken from revised urban plans of certain towns.
The total water consumption on this area is given in Table 1.2., while facts on certain industries
and consumers are given in Tsble 1.3. Quantity of the wastewater is about 70-80 % of domestic
water consumption. Quantity of industial wastewater vary depend on industry type. Estimation
for 1995 on the bases of study /24/ and other data results in overall a flow of around 10600
m31day. Only part of this quantities will be collected by sewerage system, about 8500 m3/day,
because part of it will be lost (shipyard, cement industry, construction industry, etc.).

In the past few years, on the area of Split, the quality of wastewater has been measured and the
results of last years results are given in Table l.4. Since this is, a combined-type sewerage system
the intensity of wastewater varies greatly and is affected by rainwater and infiltration water in
the system. Therefore, all level of pollution and the quantity of specific- materials that- are
introduced into the environment are calculated on the basis of expected production of waste
material and not on the basis of the concentration in wastewater.-
Within the systen of industrial centres within the Republic of Croatia Split and his region is
refefred to as a category 2 centre.
Industry of the Split region is mostly located in the norther part of the community around north
part of the Kastela bay (Vranjic basin). This region around nort port in Kastela bay is industrial
zone -of the comunity Split, Solin and Kaitela. In this area we have general port, oil port,
railway, Split shipyard, Vranjic shipworks, and most of industry. In the Trogir area the most
significant industry is shipyard located in the Trogir bay.
The region of the Kaitela bay -accommodates-a while -variety of industry. Some of them has
strong organic wastewaters and high flow like several food and drink processing plants,
including a large brewer, a winery, two soft drink plants, dairy and one big and several small
slaughter house. This industry bighly contribute to potlution of the Kastela bay because all of
this industry have been discharged wastewaters into easten part of the bay. Other industry are:
metal finishing, metal construction, chemical processing, PVC factory, shipyard and shipworks,
machinery production, building industry and other typical industry associated with urbanized
area.
Table 1.5. brings figures on quality of industrial wastewater in accodance with a survey of
industrial discharges carried out during 1990 /24/. Some of industries had appropriate
wastewater treatment plant. However, due to current industrial restuctriation processes.
economical fluctuations, bankrupcy and liquidation of certain industries and the development of
new ones, these figures are given rather as a reference and apply to industry that is foreseen to
exist in the following period. Most of big industry not operate in fall capacity or not operate at
all. In same time small industry have been establishing. Existing states of industrial wastewaters,
treatment plants and other characteristics are not known and appropriate study have to be
developed in the next stage of the project.
Most of these industry from Split and Solin will significantly contribute both flow and strength
organic waste water which will be biodegraded in the treatment plant, especially food and
drinling processing plants. Organic load from such industry have been estimated about 89000
equivalent people. Discharges from other industry like chemical processing and metal finishing
may contain materials dangerous for treatment processes or pass through treatment works and
polluted the sea water at the outfall.
As it is presented in table 1.3. industrial water consumption in community Split drop from
13.262.000 in 1987 to 10.707.000 in 1995. and will continue to decline as was projected to
5.874.000 in 2010 year. Major reason for this is better water economy with industrial works.
Information about present condition is not available because changes are frequent and
considerable. For example, the largest industrial plants of INk-Vinil and Adriachem in Kstel
Sucurac with around 1500 employees haven't been operating for 4 months. Frequent and
considerable changes can be expected during following few years. After that period stabilization
and the end of restructuring of industry can be expected. Therefore it is necessary to prepare and
10



conduct the program to analyze industry, circumstances and needs in reference to protection of
environment and wastewater treatment plant. Because of the circumstances it is not
recommended to haste with planning of secondary treatment plant because input data is
subjected to frequent changes.
In order to protect the sewerage system and wastewater purification plant Directive /25/ (Chapter
2) on Trade Effluent Discharge Standards for sewerage system in communities Split, Solin and
Kastela was issued.
Today the majority of industrial wastewaters have been discharged into Kastela bay because of
its position along the coastline. Planned sewerage system will deliver industrial wastewater to
wastewater treatment plant and then discharge it into Brac Channel. During the initial phase of
the treatment plant development removal of solids and suspended materials will be limited.
Therefore the majority of wastewater will be discharged into sea water of Brac ChanneL In order
to protect Brac Channell the Trade Effluent Discharge Standards should be strictly carried out
and strict trade effluent monitoring controls instituted. It is also necessary to begin the process of
greening of industry.
Study carried out in 1990. /24/ involving industry that existed in that period established
measures that industry had to take (treatment level) in accordance with the Trade Effluent
Discharge Standards in order to be connected to the sewerage system of Split/Solin area. Same
measures are still valid for industry that exists today and should be strictly carried out
Similar study hasn't been carried out for Kakela and Trogir area. However industry is not well
spread in this area or its influence on urban wastewater characteristics is insignificant (e.g.
shipyard in Trogir, cement factory in Kastel Su6urac etc.). The only factories that, if working,
will have significant influence on quality of urban wastewater of the Kaktela sewerage system
are INA Vinil and Adriachem situated in Kastel Sucurac.

1.4. THE SEWERAGE SYSTEM SOLUTION - CONCEPT
1.4.1. Metbology of solution selection  -
If wishing to exploit the coastal sea, i.e. the coast as it is foreseen, wastewater should be
accumulated at several locations, treated to a certain extent and disposed into the sea far enough
so that it will not affect the quality of the coastal and also open sea. Solving wastewater disposal
should meet required standards and also prevent undesired long-termn effects. The question is
how to do it in the most useful way.
The sewerage system is always designed in accordance with certain water and sanitary standards
that set the legal framework for a certain solution. Departing from the existing situation, and also
taking into consideration its usage, water and sanitary conditions require that all wastewater
from the area of Split, Solin, Kastela and Trogirr be disposed into the Brac Channel and the Split
Channel far enough along with previous corresponding treatment that will ensure a permanent
protection. This means that the Kaltela and Trogir Bay cannot be permanent recipients of
wastewater from towns that surround them /2/, /3/ and /8/. With such requirements with a
determined recipient, the basic prerequisites for solving the problem of sewerage system in this
area have been set. The engineers were to find the best technical solution that would meet the
required sanitary and environmental standards.
Choosing the location for the treatment plant was the next crucial step in solving this problem. It
was desirable that the plant be close to the recipient and that the greatest part of wastewater
reaches it by means of gravity. Bearing this in mind the entire area of the Brac and Split Channel
would be appropriate locations for the plant. However, this coastal area is extremely valuable
and is primarily intended for housing, tourism and recreation and as such is not suitable for a
wastewater treatment plant. Apart from that, the greatest part of the coastal area is already
populated. On the other hand the plant should be located in such a way that it takes ihe
advantage of most of the existing sewerage system thus requiring as less reconstruction as
possible. Unfortunately, as it is presently the case, all the wastewater is concentrated in the very
centres of towns where there are no facilities for -building wastewater treatment plants. Such
situation did not provide any simple solution.
In order to reach the most suitable solution, a detailed analysis of potential locations for the
treatment plant was worked out /I1. Considering the plant features (capacity, dimensions,
environmental impact, necessary infrastructure etc.), the potential locations were determined.
Each location was completed with corresponding technical sanitary, town planning and other
requirements on the basis of which a conceptual design of the plant was worked out. The
solutions were evaluated and ranked. A conceptual design for the three most favorable locations
was worked out accordingly as to make the final decision and taking into consideration the
recipient, plant and outfall features and the sewerage system in general. The solutions were
studied in detail bearing in mind the stipulated criteria. /1/. The results obtained were presented
to  experts, town  planners, representatives of all interested institutions, government
representatives and others who were welcome to express their opinion and propose the most
suitable solution. On the basis of the aforementioned the most suitable solution for the Split,
Solin, Kastela and Trogir sewerage system was chosen.
1A.2. Sewerage system concept
On the basis of detailed analysis it have been concluded that protection of the sea environment
have to be implemented by: treatment of wastewater at the sewerage treatment work, disposal of
17



effluent by long submarine outfall, treatment of industrial wastewater at production site and
greening industry.
The long-term solution for the Split, Solin, Kastela and Trogir sewerage ystem foresees the
construction of two separate sewerage systems, that of Split - Solin and the one of Kastela -
Trogir. (Fig. 1.5). These systems are separate-type systems. Each one would have its central
wastewater treatment plant and a corrsponding submarine outfall. All the wastewater from Split
and Solin would be united at the central plant Stupe in Stobrec, to the north of the commercial
and transport terminal (TTTS). Treated water would be drained into the sea of the Brac Channel
in front of Stobrec. All the wastewater from Kastela and Trogir would be united at the central
treatment plant on the Island of tiovo, to the south of the village of 켩dno. Treated wastewater
would be drained into the Split Channel in front of Mavascica. In order to unite all this
wastewater into the tratment plants, appropriate sewerage collectors would need to be built, as
well as a number of pump stations and facilities.
In order to protect the sea and perfortnance of sewerage treatment works, treatment of industrial
wastewater at the production site will be instituted. The trade effluent policy will be established
and strict trade effluent monitoring controls instituted.
1.423. The Split - SoIin sewerage system
1.43.1. Treatment plant and submarine outfall
Treatment plant
The crucial element of this system is the wastewater treatment plant (15). Analyses have shown
that on the area of the Split peninsula there is not a suitable! area where a plant of 8 hectares
could be located. The Stupe site was chosen as the most favorable solution. This site is north of
the T7M and south of the city landfill Karepovac. This area is not suitable for any other
purposes and it is at the same time far enough from the city and is not in collision with the
purpose of the nearby land.

The size of the plant complies with Austrian and German standards and instructions A131 from
ATV. It was anticipated that the works would serve a population equivalent of up to 632833,
including tourists and industrial contributions. The plant was designed by the Austrian company
Scieffe & Forsthuber Consulting from Salzburg in cooperation with the Faculty of Civil
Engineering in Split. As the technological process, the two-stepped process with active sludge
was chosen (AB process) although satisfying results may also be obtained with a single-stepped
process. The process was chosen according to a complex analysis of these processes 112/. The
main advantage of the two-stepped process lies in the fact that in accordance with the
cbaracteristics of the recipients the water will for a long time only need partial treatment so that
the level of treatment provided by phase A of the AB process is in this case completely
satisfactory.
The plant was planned in several parallel technological lines, and each line in several
technological phases, i.e. treatment levels. The basic elements and construction phases of the
plant are adapted to the long-term requirements of the system and are as follows:
I phase               II phase              m phase
screens                B process             anaerobic tanks
aerated gritigrease rem.   settling tanks    sludge digestion

sludge treatment                             flocculation and settling
disinfection
Efficiency of the plant and characteristics of the effluent obtained in certain phases is as follows:

Apart from the mentioned phases, it was foreseen for the beginning of the system construction
that the plant operates only with a mechanical level of treatment, i.e. only with the screens and
aerated grit/grease removal chamber. With the construction of the plant divided into phases the
level of treatment would be adapted to the real needs and there would be a possibility for the
third level of treatment in the future should this be necessary.

number of workers, chemicals consumption, required space and the quantity of waste that is
separated in the plant, so that the phases are as follows:

Submarine outfall
In order to satisfy the characteristics of the recipient, primarily regarding the bacteriological
pollution, a corresponding submarine outfall was foreseen for each construction phase of the
plant Together with the treatment plant it would operate as a unique system plant - outfall. With
regard to this, there will be two submarine outfalls im the final phase of realizing the treatment
plant One of them would be rather long as a result of a phase-by-phase construction and a
shorter one depending on the final condition.
At the beginning, the mechanical treatment would require a submarine outfall 3230 m long, with
a 400 m long diffuser. Depth at the point of disposal is 42 m. The diameter of the outfall is 1400
m     Initial dilution will be 250 and secondary 35.
As for the complete biological treatment of wastewater, the shorter outfall can be 931 m long,
with a 400 m long diffuser. Depth at the point of of disposal is 32 m. The outfall diameter
should be 1340 mm. Initial dilution will be 175 and secondary 6.
In the first time period when treatment work will work with ca 50M   capacity shorter submarine
outfall can be built In this case total length of outfall will be 2600 m with a 400 m long diffuser.
The outfall diameter should be at shalow water in Stobrec bay (956 m) 1000 mm while out of
by 700 mm. Depth at the point of disposal is 36.65 m. Initial dilution will be 350 and secondary
34.
The land part begins at the outlet and inlet chamber next to the treatment plant (Fig.l17.).
Accepted route of the land part follows the transport terminal plateau, the access road to the
terminal, crossing the access road in the south after the railing of the terminal. The route follows
the access road as far as to the Adriatic highway, goes along it and Zrnovnica river estuary,
crosses the highway toward Stobrec camp. The submarine part begins at the Stobrec camp,
crosses the Stobrec bay in the direction of Brac Island.  -
The outfall route has a slight fall from the waste water treatment plant to the beginning of the
submarine part and even further. Even though this fall is not necessary since the outfall is
operated under pressure, depth difference makes possible emptying of the pipeline at a single
point as well as collecting of the water after rinsing. The atitude of the land part takes the
advantage of natural characteristics of the area, for the most part it requires digging for
protectiorn. The submarine part is raised at such an altitude to provide a fall towards the outlet
end, Fig 1.8.

The diffuser is located at the end of the submarine part, whereas deaereation manhole is at the
end of the land part (or the begininng of the submarine part). Location of diffuser depends on
stage of realiztion of the system (quan"t of water and level of treatment, or rate at which the
sewerage system is realized) Locations for I phase and final phase is given on Fig 1.9.
Solid wastes from treatment iplant
The solid wastes associated with the operation of the treatment plant will consist o screenings,
grease, oil, grit, sand and biosolids sludge. Screenings will be wash, dewatered and compacted
before transport to the a landfill site or incinerate on-site. Oil and grease will be burn on small
incinerator in first time period and later will be dispose ito the digester. Grit and sand after
passing through fine screens will be suitable for disposal to landfill or can be used for
landscaping purposes. Stabilized biosolids from the treatment plant will be stabilized by
anaerobic digestion and dewateed. Sludge will have a long term stability and will be suitable for
agricultural or horticultural purposes Tot quani  of sludge which will be produced at the
works depend of inflow quantities of waste water and treatment leveL In accordance with total
caPacity ofthe trement plant daily quantities ofthe sludge production can be ca 55 tlday.

In the first time period (15-20 years) treatent plant will work probably with 50 % capacity.
Initial wastewater flows will be lower than 50%/o and will depend on development of sewerage
system. Increase capacity of the wozks will be necessazy when wastewater from Kaalinic Brig
(existing submarine outfall) will be transferred to the central treatment plant
1A.31 Sewerage system of Split and Solin
In order to bring all the wastewater to the plant, large sewerage collectors and pump stations
should be built As already said the existing Split sewerage system collects all the wastewater in
the city port and the Sjeverna luka (commercial harbour), 4 km from the site of the future plant
In order to connect the northern Split area (Dujmova3a) and the town of Solin onto the central
plant, a hydrotechnical tunnel approx. 2.4 km long should be built beneath Karepavac which
would transfer all the wastewater of the northern Split area and Solin onto the southern area of
the Split peninsula. Fig. 1.5. Fig. 1.10.
Such tunnel would be necessary for the improvement of Kastela Bay because of its
environmental significance for the protection of the Bay. Approximately 80% of organic
pollution that reaches Kaktela Bay comes from the northern Split area and the town of Solin so
that if transferred into the Brac Channel, the pollution of Kaktela Bay would considerably be
reduced. Several pump stations would be required for connecting the southern Split area onto the
cental plant Fig. 1.10. The southern Split area does have a sewerage system by means of which
the wastewater is concentrated in the Split port Two collectors - the one at Ba&ice and the other
along the railroad onto which the collector in the Domownskog rata St. is connected, form a
complex scheme of the Split sewerage system by which the wastewater is collected in the city
port All other zones at higher elevations are connected onto the aforementioned collectors by
gravitation, while the zones at lower elevations are pumped by means of a number of pump
stations. However, the direction of all the wastewater should be changed into the opposite
direction (southwards) and brought to the Stupe plant In order to rationalize the costs of
repumping part of the system will be altered from a combined to a separate one, and the whole
new system will be built as a separate systemn in which the transmission mains will be directed
towards the wastewater treatment plant
Improvement costs of the existing system and bringing all the wastewater onto the central plant
will be very high, and the construction of the system would last rather long even in the event
should the financial means be provided (over ten years). Operation costs would also be very high
due to often repumping of wastewater.
Basic concept of the proposed sewerage system design
The sewerage system covers the Split/Solin area in accordance with the General urbanistic plan
(GUP). Wastewaters of this area (industrial wastewater as well as domestic wastewater) are
collected by a system of canals and pumping stations and delivered to the wastewater treatment
plant situated in Stupe area. Purified water is then disposed into the Brac Channel though
submarine outfall situated in Stobrec, Fig. 1.10.

The sewerage system is partially combined but mostly separate sewerage system- A combined
sewerage system covers the area of already existing combined sewerage system. It will be stiU
in use but the tendency is to eliminate it in the future. Combined sewerage system covers the
major area of already existing sewerage system of Split Peninsula. That is the sewerage system
that tends toward city port with the trunk sewer alongside the railroad, tnmk sewer Setaliste
Bacvice and a series of smaller trunk sewers situated in old part of the town as well as a part of
already existng sewerage system that tends toward Vranjic basuLn Higher zones are covered with
combined sewerage system while coastal areas will be covered with separate sewerage system no
matter if it already exists or it is only proposed. The rest of the area will be covered with
separate sewerage system.
A storm water will be disposed into coastal sea area on certain locations, diredy or indirectly,
by means of existing springs and torrents. In the combined sewerage system storm water will be
disposed into the sea at initial ratio of sanitary sewer and storm water of 1:3. An outfall position
(depth and distance from the shore) should satisfy the required sea standards at each outfall site.
Considering the topography and urbanisation of the area as well as  the location of the
wastewater treatment plant, the entire sewerage system can be divided into few separate
catchment areas, Fig. 1.10. They are: the South catchment area, the Dujmovaca catchment area,
the Solin catcbment area and the Stobrec catchment area. A construction of series of smaller and
bigger pumping stations, truk sewers and other structures is planned in order to conduct
wastewater to a singular wastewater treatment plant
The South catchment area covers the area of Split Peninsula from Znjan in the south then
following the peninsula watershed to Domovinskog rata street in the north and a shipyard in the
wesL Wastewaters of this area are delivered to the central pumping station of this catchment area
PS Katalini6a Brig. Its dry weather capacity is 2,097 m3ts while its rain weather capacity is 9,24
m3ts. This pumping station is situated on the hill Katalinica Brig nearby existing submarine
outfalL The purpose of this pumping station is to pump wastewater from the South catchment
area to the central wastewater treatment plant Stupe. Three main trunk sewers of the South
catchment area are connected to this pumping station. They are: the city poIt trunk sewer, trunk
sewer alongside the railroad and trunk sewer from Setaliste Ba6vice street Second biggest
pumping station is PS Znjan. Its capacity is 2,1 m3/s. It is a pumping station situated on rising
main of the pumping station Katalinia Brig.-
The Dujmovaca catchment area covers the area of Dujmova&a in the north following the line of
Mravinaci potok to existing Jadranska cesta and than following river Jadro to the sea; in the
south following the peninsula watshed to the Pujanke district; in the west Pujanke district and
the area below Domovinskog rata street to the shipyard. Wastewaters of the area above existing
Jadranska cesta are delivered by gravity to the collecting chamber of the tunnel from where
wastewater drains by gravity to the wastewater treatment plant Stupe. Wastewaters of the area
below existing Jadrauska cesta are delivered to the main pumping station Dujmovaca situated
west from the crossroads Solinska cesta and Put mostina. This pumping station pumps
wastewater to the collecting chamber of the tunnel from where wastewater drains by gravity to
the wastewater treatment plant Stupe. Dry weather capacity of Dujmovaca pumping station is
0,630 m3ns wile its rain weather capacity is 0,963 m3/s.             -
The Solin catchment area covers the area of town of Solin, in the south to Mravinac- potok and
in the west to the boundary of Kastela county. Its north boudary is formed by suburban districts.
It also includes wastewater coming from solinska zagora (area over the mountain). Wastewater
28



of this area is delivered to the pumping station Solin. Wastewater is then pumped to the 1mnk
sewer saed above exisfing Jadanska-cesta and then to the collectingschmber of the tunnel.
Diy wather capaity of this pumping station is 0,650 in3s:.    -
Wasewater of Dujnoaa and Solin catcbment area is delivered to the collecting chamber of
Stupe nnel from where it drains by gravity to the wastewater treatment plant Stupe.
The Stobre6 catcibment area covers ihe rest, mainly south, area of city of Split Wastewater of
this area is partially by gravity and partially by means of pumping stations drained to the main
wastewatertrainent plant The biggest pumping station of this area is the pumping station tine.
Its dry weather capacity is 0,188 m3ls while its rain weather capacity is 0,240 m3/s.
It can be observed that capital stuctures of the sewage system are: the wastewater treatment
plant Stupe and its submarine outfal tumnel Stupe, the wastewar teatment plant Katalinica
brig and its outfal ma  pumping stations: Katalinica brig, Znjan, Solin-Japirko, DNmova6a,
tine and main trnsk sewer of several catchinent areas
hiterim solution of the first phase of the sewerage system construction will be the wastewater
treatment plant Katalinida brig and its outlet
Hydrotechnical tunnel "Stuae"
In order to connect wastewater of the town of Solin area and wastwater of northern part of Split
(Dujmovava, Ravne Njive, Pujanke and other) with a common wastewater treatment plant
situated in Stobrec area, construction of the hydrotechnical tunel between Duje and Stobrec
(TITS)isplanned,Fig. 1.10. andFig. l.11.
Hydrotechnical tunnel is chosen as the most acceptable technical and long term economic
solution. A major part of water catchment area of northern and southern part of Split as wel as
part of the town of Solin area can be delivered by gravity to the wastewater treatment plant
Pumping height of lower zones is considerably decreased as well as the cost of works.
Tunnel is 2436im long. Its cross section is 15,39 ni2. The elevation of tunnel entrance is 14.36 m
above sea level while the elevation of tunnel exit is 11.93 m above sea leveL Two sewer pipes of
1300 mm diameter are situated in the tunneL. Tunnel is big enough to lay other infasructu
(electricity, telephone) out of which the most important is water supply system that connects
northern part of Split and Solin area with-planned water intake situated at 2rnovnica well. Total
volume of excavated mateial is 38500 m3.
1.433. Characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant dte
Microlocational characteristics of the wastewater treatment nilant site in reference to the
entire area
Considerng the city organisation and development, the most. appropriate wastewater treatment
plant location would be the north side of Split peninsula. It is the area intended for small
businesses. It is obvious that the basic ecological requirements for every urban location must be
fulfilled. Elevation (10-15 m above sea level) and partially built operational area are the
limitations Therefore the only suitable location will be the one situated north from the planned
railroad junction Solin-TTTS, Fi& 1.12.                       -     -

Location is situated in the far north of the Commercial-Transport Terminal area, in the foothill
of Mosor, between proposed railroad junction Solin-TITS in the south and proposed highway
Split-Zagreb in the north. The area is 8,4 hectares. Ground surface elevation is mainly 15,0 m
above sea leveL According to the General urabanistic plan (GUP) one part of this area is planned
to be used for tasportation activities. The other part of the area is situated in the comrdor of
Split-Zagreb highway. A solid waste dump Karepovac is situated approx. 550 m to the west.
The Split-Zagreb highway corridor is still not defined because its route is moved beyond Mosor
(according to the Area plan of the Spli Municipality - adopted in 1982).
A residential area of low density is planned north from the highway corridor. A small number of
residential buildings is already constructed north-east from the wastewater treatment plant
location. Significant forest zone is also situated in this area. A Commercial-Transport Terminal
contents are situated south from the wastewater treatment plant location, Photograph 1.
Considering the purpose of the area: large traffic areas, solid waste dump, forests (Mosor
hillsides), the collision between proposed wastewater treatment plant location and proposed
puurpose of the surrounding area is the smallest
Site location in reference to the city infrastructure
Traffic
A track and a switching yard of TTTS-Solin railway junction are planned in the south of Stupe-
TlTS site. A proposed highway corridor is situated north from the plant complex.
Water supply system
Water supply of Stupe-TITS area is planned from the water supply system of mrnovnica well
that delivers water of the entire area south of Koresnica by gravity.
Electricity supply system
According to the General Urabanistic Plan (GUP) TS 110/35 kV "Meterize", TS "Sucidar" and
TS 110/35 kV "Centar" will be connected to the main city transformer station TS 220/100 kV
"Vrboran". TS -Vrbobran" is connected to the main transformer station 380/22/110 kV situated
in Konjsko. TS 110/10 "Split-3" was built to supply the middle part of Split peninsula.
Transformer stations: 110/10 kV "Split-4" and 110/35 kV "Split-5 - Koresnica" will be built to
supply the area of Stobrec.
Stupe-TTTS site will be supplied with electrical energy from planned TS 110/35 kV Koresnica.

According to the conceptual design of TTTS (Civil Eng. Institute, Split) it is necessary to move
the switching yard building south from railroad-junction. It is possible to place it as a part of
central boiler goup building complex.
Lithographic. engineering geological and hvdroyeolo ical characteristics of the area
Surface area is made of prolluvial sediments (youngest Quartemary sediments Qpr), composed
of silty-clay material with some graveL Eocenic flisch (E2,3) mostly built of marls was
deposited under proluvial sediments.
Prolluvial sediments are poorly compacted and heterogeneous. Limestones are degredated but as
the depth increases they have better physical and mechanical characteristics.
Silty-clay material with some gravel has intergranular porosity, it is hydrogeological collector.
These sediments are saturated. Water table was observed immediately under the ground surface.
.Marls form impermeable base. Drainage must be well designed in order to secure functionality
of the stucture. Foundations must be built on marl base.
According to the Seismic map of Croatia, this area is situated in the zone where maximum
earthquake intensity of 7캫CS for recurrent period of 200 years is expected.
If shallow foundations are built on proluvial sediments higher level of seismic risk should be
taken into account because of soil composition and high underground water leveL
General hvdrological characteristics
Civil Engineering Institute, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Split produced hydrogeological base
plans and detailed design for regulation of one part of water courses Bekavac and Vrbovik
(according to "General solution of drainage and stream regulation of ITIS area" and general
design "Regulation of water courses Bekavac and Vrbovik" produced in 1981. and 1987).
Regulation wasn't done till today.
The same principle should be used for regulation of the upper part of stream Bekavac and one of
its tributaries. It must be done because they either intercept or are situted near the wastewater
treatment plant site.
Microclimate characteristics
General climate characteristics are given in the begging of the Study (General plan of
Split,1978.). It will be possible to define microclimate characteristics of the area after one year
measurements and monitoring. This must be done in the next design phase. Climate elements are
very important factors in wastewater treatment plant design.
Existing and planned infitructure
Traffic
Existing traffic infastructure consists of partially built TITS with traffic routs and junction road
to Jadranska cesta (MC-2) at Stobrec area. Water purification plant complex can be connected
34



with urban iraportation network though previously mentioned access road for ITIS and
furiher witb separate access road that passes under the planned tack This road is 7,0 m wide.
Parldng lot of224PlM capacityis planmed in the east of the complex.
Ia new urban frewway.is biult within the highway coridor (route placed behind Ko2zak),'plant
complex should be accessed fom it.
Water supply
Existing pipe line of 500 mm diameter coming out of reservoir Visoka I is situated north from
Jadranska cesta_ Another pipe line of 300 mm diameter is buned in TTTS access road.
Commercial-Transport Terminal Split (TTT) as well as the ewastewater treatment plant site will
be connected to existing pipe line during the first phase. As the ultimate solution they will be
connected to Zrnovnica water supply system.
Electricity                                    -       ;
Electricty fahlities and instalations are not present in this area Therefore, according to the
project, wastewater treatment plant will be connected to TS 1 10/10 Koresnica.
If wastewater treatment plant is built before TS 110/10 Koresnica it should be connected to
xisting TS 35/10 Miljevac with 10 kV cable extending iiom TS 10/0,4 at the plant site,
following the TITS road to TS Mljevac.
Telecommunications
Telecommunication facilities are not present in this area Therefore it is necessary to lay 50-pair
cable between wastewater treatment plant site and planned Al'C Split4.
3patial disposition ofthe site and use of the area
Taling into consideration the site position in larger urban area as well as purpose of the
surrounding area (operational area, highway corridor that is stihl not defined) limitation factors
of this site for wastewater treatment plant construction are the leasL
It is necessary to cover preliminary physical treatment objects (racks and possibly sand traps,
gease traps and primary sedimentation tanks).
There are no special requirements conceming building outines. Administation building should
be placed in the east facing existing residential zone. Access road passes through the tunnel
under planned track- Surrounding area should be planted out of security and aesthetic reasons. It
is also possible to build all necessary installations. Railroadjunction can also be used.
1.4.4. The Kaftela - Trogir sewerage system
1.4.4.1. Treatment plant and submarine outfall
As already mentioned the central plant of this system is located on the tiovo Island, at the site
south of 켩dno (Photograph 2.) This site is visually remote from the coastal part and is natually
well protected by a depression so that its location cannot affet the coastal sea. This site that is
rather close to the sea of the Split Channel (400 m) is practically the only area of minor
importance where the Ureatnent plant could be located according to the long-term needs of
Kakela and Trogin Collecting the wasewater from Kastela and Trogir at this particular site is
the most suitble solution in the enviomnental, economic and technical point of view /147/ and
/5/.

The greatest disadvantage of this location is the same as for Split - it is rather far from present
locations for collecting the wastewater in Ka쬽ela and Trogir and the need for building a tunnel
through the Ciovo Island because the wastewater needs to be transfen-ed from Kastela and Trogir
into the Split ChanneL The situaion here, is though somewhat more simple because there is not
a significant sewerage system in this area so that the problem should be approaced from the very
beginning.
The wastewater treatment plant has the same characteristics as the one in Split, but its capacity is
much smaller. It was anticipated that the works would serve a population equivalent of up to
150000, including tourists and industrial contributions.
The hydraulic load of the plant is:
Qaver,day Qmax,hour
m3tday      35888   1
m3thour       1494       2340
m3/s         0.415       0.650
Mechanical wastewater treatment would require a 2400 m long submarine outfall, and a 400 m
long diffusor. The outfall would be at a depth of 52 m and the outfall diameter 900 mm. Initial
dilution will be 705. Biological wastewater treatment would require a 650 m long submarine
outfall, and a 400 m long diffusor.
In the first time period when treatment work will work with ca 50% capacity shorter and smaller
submarne outfall can be built In this case total length of outfall will be 2050 m with a 400 m
long diffuser. The outfall diameter should be 500 mm. Depth at the point of disposal is 52 in
Initial dilution will be 394.
The outfall route has a slight fall from the waste water treatment plant to the beginning of the
submarine part and even further. Even though this fall is not necessary since the outfall is
operated under pressure, depth difference makes possible emptying of the pipeline at a single
point as well as collecting of the water after rinsing. The altitude of the land part takes the
advantage of natural characteristics of the area, for the most part it requires digging for
protection. The submarine part is raised at such an altitude to provide a fall towards the outlet
end, Fig 1.13.
The diffuser is located at the end of the submarine part, whereas deaereation manhole is at the
end of the land part (or the beginning of the submarine part). Location of diffuser depends on
stage of realization of the system (quantity of water and level of treatment, or rate at which the
sewerage system is realized). Locations for I phase and final phase is given on Fig. 1.14.

The solid wastes associated with the operation of the treatment plant will consist of screenings,
grease, oil, gnt, sand and biosolids sludge. Screenings will be wash, dewatered and compacted
before transport to the a landfill site or incinerate on-site. Oil and grease will be bmn on small 
incineator in first time period and later will be dispose to the digester. Cit and sand af*er
passing tbrough fine screens will be suitable for disposal to landfill or can be used forr
landscaping purposes. Stabilized biosolids from the treatment plant will-be stabilized by
anaerobic digestion and dewatered. Sludge will have a long term stability and will be suitable for
agnicultural or horticultural purposes. Total quantity of sludge which will be produced at the
works depend of inflow quantities of waste water and treatment leveL In accordance with total
capacity of the treatnent plant dally quantities of the sludge production can be ca 21 t/day.
In the first time period (10-15 years) treatment plant will work probably with 50 % capacity.
Initial wastewater flows will be lower than 50%1* and will depend on development of sewerage
system.
1A4.2 Sewerage system of Kaltela
The sewerage system for Kasela would be rather easy to solve. The greatest part of wastewater
of this area (approx. 70%) is collected by gravity by the main collector which is located in the
old Kastela road, i.e. the entire area above this collector. The wastewater from the area between
this collector and the sea is transferred onto the main collector by means of a number of pump
stations. At the end of the main collector is the main pump station that will transfer all the
wastewater from the Kastela area into the tunnel on the tiovo Island and through the tunnel
bring it to the treatment plant The wastewater from the plant is by gravity drained into the sea
by means of submarine outfll
The sewerage system covers the area of the town of Kastela in accordance with the General
wubanistic plan (GUP). It is the separate sewerage system. Wastewater is by means of a special
sewer network delivered to the wastewater treatment plant A storm water will be disposed into
the coastal sea area on certain locations directly or indirectly by means of existing springs and
torrents
Considering the topography and proposed urbanisation of the area as well as the location of the
wastewater treatment plant, the entire sewerage system can be divided into few separate
catchment areas, Fig. 1.15. They are: the area above Ka쬽elanska cesta that can be connected by
gravity with the wastewater treatment plant and the area below Kahtelanska cesta that is by
means of several pumping stations connected to the trunik sewer situated in Kaitelanska cesta. A
wastewater is conducted through a main trunk sewer situated in Kastelanska cesta to the
wastewater treatment plant sitated on Ciovo Island. Every pumping station forms a separate
smaller catchment area. Several pumping stations connected in series form a bigger sewerage
system that is connected to a main tunk sewer situated in Kaltelanska cesta.
Larger pumping stations are: P.S. Gomilica 1 of 114,4 Vs capacity, P.S. LukWic II of 48,8 Vs
capacity and seveal others.

The biggest pumping stations of ultimate phase are: P.S. Jadro of 370 1ls capacity and P.S.
Pantana-Divulje ofA21 Vls capacity that partially collects astwaters of Trogir. The pressure
pipeline of P.S. Pantana-Divulje is 1600 m long. It connects wastewater of Ka쬽ea with
wastewater of Trogir at the entrance of the tiovo tunnel" Fig. 1.5. This pipeline is situated
mostly under the water in Kakela Bay. In case of final phase construction it is necessary to
constmct hydrotechnical tunael through tiovo of 1900 m length as well as one part of the tiovo
Island sewerage system
It can be observed that the capital structurs of the final so]tution of the sewage system are: the
wastewae treatment plant tiovo and its submaine outfalL tiovo tumnel main pumping
stations: P.S. Jadro of 370 lls capacity and P.S. Pantana-Divu1je of 421 I/s capacity and its
submarine rismng main and the main trunk sewer situated in Kaltelanska cesta.
1.4.4.3. Sewerage system of Trogir
The concept for the Trogir sewerage system is similar, except that there are three main sewerage
systems: the land sewerage system, the Ciovo Island sewerage system and the sewerage system
of the old part of the town located on a small island betweeL the mainland and the tiovo Island.
The land sewerage system of Trogir is mostly by gravity united onto one pump station by means
of which it is transferred to the tiovo tunnel. Zones at lower elevations are repumped into main
collecting sewers. The wastewater from the northern area of the Ciovo Island is by means of a
number of pump stations transferred into the tiovo tunnel, while the wastewater from the
southern and western part of the island are united on the western part of the island at the
wastewater treatment plant Wastewater from the old part of the town is connected with the land
system. (Fig. 1.16.)
Planned sewerage system of Trogir is separate sewerage system Wastewater is delivered to the
wastwater treatment plant situated on tiovo island tbrough single sewerage system. A storm
water is delivered through separate storm sewerage network to the sea. It is then disposed into
the sea in accordance with the local requirements.
The wastewater sewerage system network consists of three main catchment areas: the land
catchment area and sewerage system, the (iovo catchment area and sewerage system, and old
part of the town (small island) catchraent area and sewerage system. The sewerage system of
each catchment area consists of several smaller catchment areas. Each smaller catchment area is
formed by a pumping station that delivers water to the central wastewater treatment plant
situated on Ciovo island, Fig 1.16. Total number of required pumping stations is more than 16.
The coastal sewerage system consists of 7 pumping stations. The biggest ones are: Lokvice
(Q=283 Vs, H=24m, P=lllkW) and Medena (Q=134 1/., H=24 m, P--53 kW). The main
pumnping station of this part of a sewerage system is pumping station Lokvice that pumps
wastewater from the land over the bay to the hydrotechnical unel tiovo.
Sewerage system of the old part of the town consists of a single catchment area formed by
pumping station "Stan grad" that pumps wastewater to the sewerage system of the coastal area

Sewae   system of liovo island consists of 9 pumping tations. The biggest ones are: Liovo
(Q=25 Vs, H=25m, P=15 kW), M$ Draga (Q=43 /s, H=8 m, P=6 kW) and Okrug G (Q=144 l/s--
H-30 m, P=71 kW). Pumping stations of northem part of the  island tiovo, MiLevac and
Arbanija pump wastewater to the north entrance of the tumneL Pumping stions of the west side
of the island.: MDraga, Okrug. G., Oknig D. and Okrug D.-Recetinovac pump wastewater to the
south side of the island into trunk sewer of the wastewater treatment plant Pmnping stations
Fumnija and Mavarfica are situated in the south of the island.
Sewerage system of Trogir is very complex and expensive as it can be observed from its
description-
Sewerage system of Trogir is designed on a study leveL Only central part of the town and part of
the main trunk sewer of the land catchment area are designed on a higher leveL
1AAA. Hydrotechnical tunnel Ciovo
In order to connect wastewater of the Kagtela area and major part of Trogir (northem part of
,tiovo island and land part of the city of Trogir) with the common wastewater treatment plant
situated in the southern part of Ciovo island, a construction of hydrotechnical tunnel through
(-iovo island is planned, Fig. 1.16. and Fig. -1.17.
Hydrotechimcal tunnel was chosen as the most acceptable technical and long term economic
solution. Construction of this tunnel decreases the cost of pumping. Construction of a very
expensive trunk sewer through Saldun Bay is also avoided.
Tunel is 1851 m long. Its cross section is 10,52 rm. The elevation of tunnel entance is 17,0 m
above sea leveL The tunnel exit is situated in the south of Liovo island, and its elevation is 15,0
m above sea leveL One sewer pipe of 1000 mm diameter is situated in the tunneL. The tunnel is
big enough to lay other infiastr e (electricity, water, telephone). Total volume of excavated
material is 20500 in3. Material is mostly limestone.
1.4A.5 Characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant site
Conceptual design of the sewerage system of Kabtela anticipated two construction phases; the
constuction of wastewater treatment plant near the airport as transition phase and the
constuction of wastewater treatment phlnt on Ciovo island as the ultimate phase. The
environmenal study will treat Ciovo plant because only ultimate works will be performed.
Microlocational characteristics of the site in reference to the entire area
The wastewater treatment plant tiovo is a common plant for sewerage systems of Katela and
Trogir. It is situated in the south of Ciovo island in the middle of the valley that extends from
village Zedno to Mavarscica Bay, Fig. 1.18. This valley is not residential area or intended for
any other activity. Therefore as a less valuable area it was left to be the "green" area. Site
situated in the middle of the valley is far away from the coast (more than 800 m), inaccessible,
closed and it can't be seen from surrounding urbanised area. The wastewater treatment plant is
situated far away from the town centre, residential areas of Trogir and main inffasrctu
facilities and close by the holiday villge MavarAtica. Therefore it is the best site for the
wastewater treatment plant

The sewerage system Kastela and Trogir study (Faculty of Civil Engineering, 1990) analysed
several sites. Site situated in Kakela Bay and Trogir Bay as long term common solution wasn't
accepted because it is vezy valuable and attractive area- Acoording to -water management
authorities Split Channel that is situated accross from 6iovo island and is not a part of Kastela
and Trogir Bay is water recipient The only logical solution was the treatment plant site situated
on the south side of tiovo island. Out of aU available sites in that area, that is already
considerably built and also intended for construction, site situated in the cove below village
Zedno was considered to be the best.
The wastewater treatment plant is situated 15 m above sea leveL It is a very rational solution
considering that wastewaters of Kaktela and Trogir area (except for part of villages on Ciovo
island) must be permanently multiple times repumped to the plant
The wastewater treatment plant tiovo was worked out only on prefeasibility study level, hence
detailed information about the treatment plant and its characteristics don't exist Therefore we
can't give its precise position in reference to the urban infrastructure. Plant is situated far away
from the town centre, residential areas of Trogir and main infiastructure,facilities. It is situated
close by the holiday village Mavarstica.
Plant can be accessed by road from the area of Mavarisica Bay. Infrshucture connection
(water, electricity, phone) is also possible in Mavarscica village but only in the beginning while
the plant is still not working with its full capacity. For the ultimate works suitable infrastructure
must be built in order to meet the requirements of the plant with its capacity and characteristics.
Litho2raphic. engineering geological and hvdrogeological characteristics of the area.
The area is made of limestone beddings of Upper Cretaceous (Senonian) with infrequent
dolomite lenses.
This area is part of Primosten-Trogir-Split tectonic uimt Its north boundary is reverse fault
Kozjak. The rock mass is well jointed because of inrtnse tectonic activity.
Sandstone and limestone are brittle, jointed, very hard rocks of shell-like and irregular fracture.
Joints are of "dmi" aperture, empty or infilled with degradation products such as terra rossa and
silty clays.
Hydrogeologicaly speaking these beddings have secondary jointed porosity that is more distinct
in the surfice area. Precipitation water can be infiltrated relatively fast through the surface zone
to the sea level. Duing rainy season a temporary surface runoff toward the valley can be
expected. Therefore treatment plant site must be protected from it
According to the Seismic map of this area, the wastewater treatment plant is situated in the zone
where maximum earthquake intensity of 60MCS for recurrent period of 200 years and of 9캫CS
for recurrent period of 500 years is expected.
General hbrdrological characterisfics
Hydrological layout of this area is very simple. Site must be protected from rainfall water only.
Depending on the feasibility project of the plant it is possible that only one small stone canal that
collects water coming from the boundaries will be. sufficient
Surfaces of the plant should be mildly inclined toward the sea. Therefore the removal of ranoff
can be done by gravity.

Existing and planned infrastructure
Traffic    - .  -
Only the road that leads to M cim ca village is built near planned treatment plant complx.
Treatment plant site is connected to the road of the holiday village Mavarsiica.
Water supply
Treatment plant can be connected to the water supply system of Mavarscica village.
Sewerage
Sewerage systen doesn't exist in this area.
Electricity, Telecommunications
Detailed information about electricity and telecommunicatior system is not available.
Spatial _t2fion and use of the area
As it was earlier mentioned, the wastwater treatment plant was designed on prefeasibility study
leveL Therefore detailed information about spatial disposition and use of the treatment plant area
can not be given.
As it is evident from the indented coast and town of Trogir, collecting wastewater is very
complex and expensive and requires a construction of a larger number of pump stations and
several underwater crossings and the constuction of two tunnels The Kadtela area requires
similar facilities, even though the Kastela sewerage is somewhat more simple and cheap. Due to
all the aforementioned, the construction of the Kaktela-Trogir sewerage systm is a high-cost,
complex and long-lasting solution.
1A.5. Phases in the construction of the sewerage systems
Such solution for the Split-Solin and Kaktela-Trogir sewerage systems is very expensive both
regarding the construction as well as maintenance/operation. It is therefore foreseen that it will
not be realized in the near future. We must bear in mind that because of the standard of the
population in these areas, the people will not be able to finance the sewerage system and to repay
the loans in according to the foreseen final solution that provides a high standard protection of
the sea. This mostly applies to constuction, maintenance and operatin costs of the plant-
Because of this we have foreseen sohltions by phases by means of which the long-term solution
would be completed. As to provide such type of construction the solutions by phases should
meet the technical and technological requirements of the long-term solution, but also improve
the present environment protection, and function as a unique technical and technological whole.
Phases in the construction regarding the capacity of the plant and pump stations are provided by
building several separate operation lines: plant, outfall and other sewerage facilities. Depending
on the level of treatment each operation line will be built at several treatment levels ie.
technological treatment processes. The following is foreseen: complete mechanical wastewater
tratment (screen, sediment chamber), partial biological tratment (A phase of AB biological
treatment and sludge processing), complete biological treatment (B phase of AB procedure with
appropiate sludge processing, de-nitrification, de-phosphatization and disinfection. Each
treatment level would be accompanied by a conrrsponding submarine outfall that together with
the plant forms a unique technical and technological whole both in the sense of treatment and
wastewater disposal into the sea.
48



Construction by phases would also be necessary because the largest part of this area has no
sewerage system the construction of which would, apart from substantial fiancial means,
require a long time. This practically means that a complete and unique sewerage system would
require a very long time. As each constuction phase should improve the environmentprotection
it was foreseen that a corresponding treatment plant and submanne outfall be built for each
construction phase. This means that certam construction phases will be accompanied by building
treatment plants and outfalls. However, as the long-term solution foresees a unique treatment
plant these so-called "phase-plants are temporary because as the construction of the sewerage
system advances towards a unique sewerage system and plant they lose their function. Therefore
these phase-plants should be the least expensive as possible or to be used long enough as to
depreciate the investnent Therefore only two levels of temporary plants have been foreseen:
complete mechanical treatment and A phase of AB biological process. The sludge treatment
plant was foreseen strictly at the site of the plant, i.e. it should be permanent Mechanical
wastewater treatment would meet aesthetical standards of the sea and by long submanne outfalls
they would meet the sanitary standard of the sea. The environmental protection of the sea would
start with A phase of AB plant, and it would be more significant with the completion of B phase
of AB plant De-nitrification and de-phosphatization and disnfection would provide high quality
effluent and a long-term protection of the sea. Sites for the plant were chosen taking into
consideration the fact that they be used as long as possible so that the investmnents be most
depreciated.
Bearing in mind the town-planning, and environmental features of this region as well as the
existing state of construction of the sewerage system and outfall, we have come to three phases
of the sewerage system (Fig. 1.19.). Within them there are several smaller systems and
significant facilities. Technological phase A, final solution with two separate systems;
technological phase B with four separate systems and an A-AB level of biological wastewater
treatment at each of them; technological phase C with six temporary sewerage systems and
corresponding mechanical treatment plants. It is evident that as the sewerage systems becomes
more complete, the level of treatment increases because only in such a way is it possible to
improve the environmental protection, i.e. reduce the pollution of the sea. The technological and
economically acceptable transition from one phase of the system into the other is provided by
temporary plants that would be built at the sites of the main regional pump stations that need to
be built in accordance with the long-term concept of the sewerage system. Therefore, the
temporary plants are conceived in such a way that they be used in the followmg phase for the
final pump stations and functioning in incidental situations when the unique sewerage system
breaks down. The transition from one sewerage system of construction phase into the other
requires some major facilities that would enable smaller systems to be united into larger ones (C
into B, B into A). In this case these are two hydrotechnical tunnels Stupe and Ciovo. In order to
connect the Solin sewerage system to the one of Split it is necessary to built the Stupe tunnel,
and in order to connect the Kagtela sewerage system and part of that of Trogir with the central
plant of the Kastela-Trogir system, the Ciovo tunnel should be built
Accordingly, the following elements-subprojects of the sewer system construction are possible:
1. Projects of A technological level:
Al - Split-Solin sewer system with the centaml plant and full biological treatment and a central
outfall
A2 - Kastela-Trogir sewer system with a central treatment plant and full biological treatment and
a cental outfall.

2. Subprojects of B technological level:
BI - Stobrec sewr system with 'A-AB' phase of the AB treatment level -and the respective
outfall
B2 - Sewerisystem of the Splt port with "A-AB, phase of the,AB uatent level and the

B3 - Kaltela sewer system with one tratment plant with "A-AB" level and the rspectiv outfll
B4 - TIogir sewer system wii "A-AB" phase of the AD tratment level and the respective

B6 - the sewer system mcluding SoliM, Dujmovaca, Stobrec, with the plant "A-AB" phase of the

3. Subprojects of C technological level:

respectv outfill
C2 - Stupe tnel, Solin , Dujmovac and Stobrec sewer systm, treatment plant with full

respective outfill
07 - 6iovo sewcr system, treatment plant with ful mechanical ntatment of waste water at the
location of the cental plant and a respective outfall.
Thus, fifteen alterative solutions of phase constuction were obtained in the wide area of
Kaltela Bay, Figure 1.19. Each alteative is specific considering the cost of construction,
operation and maintenance and also with regard to its envirnmental impacts, i.e. the
impovemnent of environmental protection. This protection is improved with the centralization of
the system and with higher treatment levels; howeer, this implies costs of constuction,
operation and maintenance of the systm  The decision makers should solve the following
dilemma. which structure should be built with the available fimds while simultaneously ensuing
better environmental protection.
It is a complex and difficult problem to reach correct decisions since the selection of each phase
of the system constuction does not include only the consideration of financial means (funds) but
also the technological characteistics of the sewerage system. The funds necessary for the system
construction certainly represent the most important facto to be considered. Greater amount of
fimds implies a higher level of purification of the plant and bett collection of the waste water,
which in turn makes the long-term implementation of the system more efficient and less
expensive. If the funds are smaller the system should include lower levels of purification and
then it should be decided which is the best of the available alternatives. The selection should not
be based on some local interests since then the unique concept of the system should be
threatened and hence its most efficient construction. Possible errors can prove very expensive
and hazardous for the successful potection of the sea in this area

These selected structures ensure that each sewer system can function as a unique and complete
technological system which ensures enviomental protection and high standards for the users of
these systems. This system also ensures the use of the coastal sea in accordance with legislation,
Figure 1.21.
The treatment plan includes the plant for the material from. the septic tanks which will makes
possible efficient disposal of the waste water.
The proposed configuration of the sewer systems and treahment planu ensures a gradual and
efficient long-term solution of the problems related to the collection, treatment and disposal of
waste water in the area of Kastela Bay and Trogir Bay.
The selected technological level is in accordance with the cmrent practice and experience of the
communal organization engaged in the maintenance and management of the sewerage systaem, so
that all the problems can be efficiently solved. Almost all the structures which will be built
within the Project already exist withn the present sewerage systems. The construction of the
planned structures will result in the employment of a great number of new personneL
Since these problems related to the collection, treatment and disposal of the waste water have
been dealt with for several years many administrative and technical activities have already been
carred out. Thus, urban plans have been brought into accordance wifh the proposed solutions of
the sewer systems. Various pennmissions fiom the water management authorities have been
obtained as well as consuuction pemit for some structures. It should be bome in mind that one
part of the sewer systems has already been constructed or is being constructed according to the
selected solutions.
The Project documentation has been developed for all systems for different levels, according to
the interest of some cities and the priorities of their construction, starting from prelimiary
design to the final designs. The Split-Solin,sewer system has, thus, been developed at a higher
level of the documentation and preliminary activities and will be realized before some other
systems. The sewer system in the Kastela area has also been quite well developed, while the
Trogir region is the least well prepared, considering the documentation and construction.
Environmental impact studies have been developed for all sewer systems in accordance with
Croatian legislation. These studies represented essential conditions for obtaining the respective
permits and agreements.
The plan for the constuction of structures for the sewer systems primarily includes the proper
disposal of the waste water, i.e. first the operation of the submarine outfalls and plants, and
subsequently all other structures necessary for collecting the waste water and delivering it to the
treatment plants.
The Project also includes, simultaneously with the construction of the structures, the training of
the personnel according to the selected equipment and the purchase of the equipment for the
orgzations who will operate these systems according to the expected tass in the maintenance
of the sewer systems.

1.6. MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING
Vodovod i Kanalizacija is the operating company set up to manage the water and sewage
infratucture on behalf of the Split, Solin, Kaitela and Trogir municipalities.
Cuetly, approximately 35 staff are employed to operate the sewage system and pumping
stations for the whole four municipalities. In addition, approximately 55 technical specialists are
employed as mechanical and electrical fitter
Planed development of sewerage systems Split-Solin and Kaltela-Trogir will require significant
additional resources and additional 15-20 operatives will be required to maintain the new assets
(sewers, pump stations, telemetric system, etc.).
With two treatment plant the staffing level will increase over an extended penod of time. The
treatent works operations team will be small in the beginning peiod (6 -10). A smaller team of
chemists and laboratory staff (5-7) will be required for the initial phase. This period will require
significant activity, establishing effluent and trade effluent monitoring.
Planing development of the sewerage systems will require new management organization which
will be able to operate and maintenance new collecting system asset, treatment plants and
submarine outfills. Main component of that organization should be:
- Administration and finance department,
- Sewerage depattment,
- Treatment works department,
- Maintenance department,
- Scientific department
Treatment works team and part of collecting system team should be recruited at the beginning
period of systems construction in order to be familiarzed with the work and elements of the
Systems. Planed full automatisation of systems and treatment works will require training for
existing and new staff.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
2.1. PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT                    -                          -
The aea of concern is the wider area of Kahtela Bay and neighboring maritime areas including
the Bras and Split channels and the coastal strip bounded by the slopes of the Koijak mountains
to nrth, the city of Trogir in the west, and the river of 켼nvnica in the cast The topogaby of
the area is shown on the Figure 21. The Figure shows the topographic diversity with
mountainous land forms, gently inclined fields typical of coastal flatland and the teraced slopes
of surrounding hills.
2.1.1. Geology
This area is a part of a large C(taceDus-Tertiary system of outer Dinaric massive and a typical
Adriatic structu   unit characteized by sediments of Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary and
Quatenary time (Figure 2.2.).
Jumssic thick-deposited Eohtic and Lower Cretaceous limestones occupy a very small area
northeastern of the Jadro spring towards the Mosor Mountain .  7
Cretaceous time is represented by the deposits of Upper Cretaceous time: Turonian mainly well
stafied limestones very little commingled with dolomites and dolomitic limestones and
Senonian massive thick-deposited limestones and limestone dolomites except the complexity of
plate limestones at the feet of the Biranj Hill on the Kozjak Mounuin.
Tertiary is represented by the deposits of eocene time: classical and carbonate Eocene Flysch
deposits, breccia, breccia conglomerates, with limestone and marly deposits and fommmiifeal
limestones.
Flysch deposits of very heterogeneous structure prevaiL Petrographically they are mainly
sandstones commingled with marles, still limestone breccia, breccia conglomemtes, sandy
calcarenites and biocalcarenites may also be found.
Such marked stratification points to a rhythmical sedimentation.
Foraminiferal limestones occupy a small area at the margins of Cretaceous-Tertiary synclines.
A large part of Flysh sediments is covered by Quatenary deposts of a very varying structure
and thickness. During Quaternary, intensive erosion was a dominant process along with the
transport and local settling of materia made up of fragments of limestone-dolomitic angular
coarse skeleton and soil particles. The ratio of skeleton qutanty to soil particles and depth of
these deposits determine ecological-productive properties of this land.
Quatermary Pleistocene breccia, counting fragments of Cretaceous and Paleogene carbonate
deposits of different size, extends over a small area on the western side of Kastela farmland.
Alluvial deposits adjacent to the nvers of Jadro and Zrnovica are made up of sandy-gravely
layers of Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments.
The continental part slightly rises from the sea, gradually becoming rather inclined and
tectonically folded slope, ending in a steep fissure - reverse fissure of Kozjak and Mosor
mountains Pronounced deformities, appearing as folds sloping to the south, as well as
transversally and longitudnally split architecture are indicative of high plasticity of Flysch
deposits.

Reverse fissures of Kozjak and Mosor steeply rise from recent Flysch deposits. Other parts of
the cretaceous complex aLso make it a terrin of great energy with a number of karst
geomorphologic phenomena.
2.1.2 Soils
The soils in the area are very variable, resulting from the great vanation m different soil
formatting factors over short distances (Figure 2.3.). Such factors include: the composition of
the parent material; topography; and, human use and interference.
The relative position and relationship between topography, geological structures and altitudmal
distribution of soil types (soil mapping units) are illustrated in the schematic cross section A-A'
(Figure 2.4.).
There is close relationship between the spatial distnbution of the different soil types and the
topography flatland and gently sloping relief are covered by arable, anthropogenic, terraced
soils; abandoned terrace soils are found in areas of steeper slope; and, on the very steep slopes,
natural, shallow and skeletal soil types are developed on the underlying limestones and
dolomites.
Natural soil types include Lithosols, Calco-melanosols, Cambic soils and Rendzinas. Lithosols
lack well-developed genetic horizons, and are formed of skeletal limestones. Their appearance is
unstratified due to the physical friable nature of the limestone, to the karstic hydrology and to
intensive erosion of the smaller particles. On flat ground, these soils are very shallow (10-20
cm); on the steep slopes lithosols are found in combination with calco-melanosols and colluvial
soils, which are much deeper but very skeletal. The properties of colluvial soils, which are much
deeper but very skeletal. The properties of colluvial soils depend on the quality of the material
that is transported, the distance of transport and the physical characteristics of the environment
Calco-melanosols are shallow soils with well-developed organic horizons that lie above the
limestones. chemically, these soils have a high humus content (mull-type), an excellent soil
structure and the Calcium carbonate content is very low. Shallow depth and dryness resulting
from low water retention capacity and underlying karst hydrology are the principal limiting
factors to potential production of these soils. Calco-melansols are found in combination with
Cambic soils.
Rendzinas are humus-carbonate soils and represent a further stage in the development of the
carbonate regisoils. These are mostly plateau type soils covered with forest vegetation. Their
productivity dependents on the thickness of the humus horizon, depth of the profile and the
properties of the parent material. Rendzinas formed on the marl regolites have a deep soil solum,
in contrast to rendzinas on marl limestones or sandstones that are in direct contact with the
parent rock.
Soils developed on the impermeable Flysh marls, with a high content of silt and fine sand, are
particularly prone to physical degradation such as crusting of the soil surface and erosion. The
intensity and consequences of erosion processes differ, depending on the geology, topograpby,
climate, soils, vegetation cover and human activities. The area surveyed is made up of two
completely different geological substrta, which affect the hydrological characteristics of the
soils. In the impermeable Flysh marls, with siltly and clayey soils, sparse vegetative cover and
montane topography, erosion processes are most obvious.

MFg. 2.4. Schemadic cross-section along the section marked A-Al on Fig. 2.3.
Cambic soils are formed on Cretaceous limestones and dolomites; and on Palaeogenic
foraminiferal limestones, breccia and conglomerates. The ground where they are formed is
characterized by a high density of stones and the well-developed karstic sub-soil morphology of
the parent mateiaL As a consequence, wide variation in soil depth is a basic feature of these
soils affecting their ecological value. In contrast to the erosion processes in the area of Flysh, the
Cretaceous limestones have a high infilation capacity, which reduces or precludes the
possibility of surface runoff and hence reduces surface erosion and mass movement As a result
of the conditions affecting soil formation, in particular those relating to the parent rocks of the
aea and the action of the climate on the limestones, Calco-Cambisols and Tera Rossa soils may
also be formed.
2.13. Hydrology
Hydrological, Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments are markedly contrasted. On the one hand,
limestones and dolomites are very cracked and frequenty calcified, porous and therefore arid
and without surface waterfilows. On the other hand, Paleogene Flysh complex is practically
impermeable and liable to erosion and slide.
Quaternary colluvial deposits drape Flysh deposits protecting them from erosion. Hydrological
properties of Quatemary colluvium are determined by their texture and skeleton structure as well
as by the thickens and properties of the environment and substrates through which they have
been brought there.
The geological properties of the coastline control ground and surface drainages creating different
hydrological phenomena so that this area is comprised of rivers, smaller surface waterflows,
ground water which diffusely and concentrated enters the sea at the sea level or below it
(submarine springs).
The catcbment area of the Bay watershed is twice that ofthe Bay itself (about 120 km2).
64



Intensive urbanization caused this area to change persistently the characteristics of drained area.
So, growing quantites of precipitatioi remain on the -smrce and are discharged into the Bay
through a whole system of sma1 streams and chamels (precipitation sewerage). Since water
quantities are limited and relatively small, the water input is directly dependet on the intensity
and duration of rainfill, varying a lot and being almost completely and during summer.
Hydrological analysis of the coastal watrshed has never beeni completed so that actual quantities
have remained unknown. However, the total quantity of suface and ground waters that enter the
Bay every year have been estimated at 100 million cubic metres.
The Jadro nver and the Pantana stream account for most of the freshwater input into Kaltela
Bay. The area they drain does not belong to the surface watercourses of the coastal watershed of
the Bay. Flysch geological barrier extending along the coastline causes ground water
accumulations in the hinterland wherefrom the Pantana and the Jadro waters sprout out to the
ground. The wateshed of these small rivers covers an area exceeding 260 km2.
Annual average flow rate of the Jadro River is 9.5 m3/s. Its minimum flow is 4.0 m3/s and
maximum reaches as high value as 66.0 m3/s. The Jadro River annual run-of amounts to 300
million cubic metres of freshwater.
The Pantana flow rte has not been accrtely determined, since the spring is at the sea level
where fresh and sea water mix The average spring capacity has been estimated at 6 m3/s,
minimum being 0.5 m3/s and maximum 20.0 m3/s.
The 2rnovica River, discharging into the Split Channel, is of considerably lower capacity than
the Jadro River. Winter average flow rate has been estimated at about S m3/s and the summer
one to be very smalL
An essential property of the riverine input of fresh water is great variability affected by the
ainfilL About 70% of annual freshwater input is realized during winter.
2.1A. Climate conditions
A long time meteorological -montorng shows that the study area is with relatively warm
conditions, moderato precipitation, and markedly wmdy. Table 2.1 shows monthly frequency
and average wind speed (expressed in Beauforts) based on data obtained over the 28-year period
from 1949-1976 at the Split-Marjan saion, while Figure 2.5 shows monthly wind rose. The
north-cast wind (CBuraW is most frequent and this blows 25% of the time with an average force
of over 3 B in some autumn and wintr months Generally speaking, except in May and June, the
frequency of "bura wind never drops below 20%. "tiroko" or the south-east wind is frequent in
February, Apnl and November, so that the local maximum frequency coincides with the local
minimum of "siroko" and vise versa. The average force of the "siroko" exceeds that of the "bura"
for much of the year. The "Maestral" is on-shore suromer wind, which blows in the afternoon as
the consequence of much faster warming up of the land during the day as compared with the sea.
Its direction varies, depending on local conditions. In the study area, "maestral" is southwestern
wind blowing towards the coast at an angle of about 45. The mean frequencies of this wind in
summer time (June, July, August) are 18.3, 17.3 and 19.4 /%, respectively, while in the rest of
the year it is negligible. Ifs force in smunmer is up to force 2-3 Bf

In the summer period the frequency of the south-west wind is high. In contrast, the frequency of
the south-east and north-east winds is at a minimum in the summer months, since the passage of
low-pressure systems over this area is minimal during this period. During summer, the frequency
of the nort-ieast wind is somewhat greater than that of the south-east wind, since it regularly
occurs during the night time as part of the sea-breeze Circulation- During the summer period the
wind is generally weaker and the greatest changes occur on a daily time scale These changes are
the result of day-night circulation. The wind direction rotates over the 24 hour period in
clockwise direction, so that at night a light north-easterly wind prevails, while during the
aftenoon a south-westerly wind is predominant The afternoon or south-westerly wind may be
stronger that the night wind because it represents the sum of thermally induced sea-to-shore
winds. The so-called etesian wind, which form part of the general summer circulation of the
eastern Mediterranean region, generally blow from the northwest, although locally their
direction may correspond to the direction of on-shore winds connected with the day-night
circulation.

mean
With regard to outfalls design the most critical wind are the Southerly winds (SW, S and SE) as
these will generate on-shore currents. The mean yearly frequencies of these winds is 34.2% and
during the critical summer months (June, July and august) the frequency is 35.5 %.
Surface air temperature is controlled by the wind and other weather processes and reflects the
local balance of incoming and outgoing radiation, as well as heat storage in water bodies.
Monthly mean air temperature over the annual cycles are presented in Table 2.2. Mean annual
temperature is 16.0캜 and the annual range (difference in mean temperature between the coldest
and warmest months) is 17.90C. January appears to be the coldest month with a mean
temperature of 7.60C and July the warmest month with a mean temperature of 25.50C, which is
in agreement with changes in global irradiance.

The mean annual precipitation in this area is 820.6 mm with a minimum of 613.0 mm and a
maxiunm  of 1101.5 mm. Precipitation is, on average, lowest in July and highest in November
(Table 2.3.). The annual distribution of rainfall reflects both cyclonic activity and local
topography. Since orographic rainfall is affected by the local topogWhy, a single rainfall
recordmg station cannot be represenative of the spatial distnrbution of rainfall over the entire
area Companson of the monthly ranfall figures suggests that the mean monthly total
precipitation at the Katela Airport station is generally higher than that at the Split-Majan
station. The Kaktela Airport station is situated in the vicinity ofthe highest mountain in the area,
which is oriented in an ENE-WSW direction, practically perpendicular to the giroko". This is
the wind that carries humid and relatively warna air and therefore usaully coincides with rainy
weather.

2.1.5. Oceanography
The oceanographic chaacteistics of the marine environermnt of the area, in terms of the cufemnts
and distribution of temperatue, salinity and density depend upon the characteristics of the wind
field, the inflow of fieshwater, the insolaion and the influence of neighbouring sea. the effects
of tidal oscillation are relatively weak and negligible due to the small amplitude of the
oscillations of the surfiace resulting in relaively weak horinal currents.

Kakela Bay
The Kastela Bay is a relatively deep basin witb an average depth of about 23 m (Figure 2.6.). It
covers a total surface of about 60 km2. It is deepest at the inlet (an-avrage inlet depth is about
40 m), so that the communication with the adjacent basin (the Split Channel) is good. Its
flushing time and changes in the current field are greatly induced by local winds. The tides
energy is considerable smaller. Since wind oscillates mostly on the time scale of synoptic
disturbance, the curent field does the same with some delay.
The estimated flushing time of the Bay is about one month. The eastern, relatively shallow part
which represents one fourth of the total body of the Bay water, has the flushing time of 15 days.
Some recent current measurements in the Bay inlet have shown that under strong winds the
flushing time of the Bay may be considerably shorter, even less than five days. The same is
presumably applicable to the eastern part of the Bay as well. This part of the Bay receives the
bulk of waste waters entering the Bay.
In the surface layer of the Kaitela Bay, a number of residual circulation types - both cyclonic,
antcyclonic, and a combination of the two can be seen at different times. The type of circulation
is dependent on many factors, but primarily on the wind. The south-west wind generates
incoming currents in the surface layer, while the north-east wind generates outgoing currents. At
same time the surface circulation patterns in the Bay are anticyclonic and cyclonic with respect
to the two winds.
The temperature and the salinity of the sea water have been measured monthly since the late
1940s at a station located in the center of the Kastela Bay. In addition, sporadic measurements of
these parameters are carried out in other parts of the bay.
Table 2.5 shows the average monthly values of water temperture at the central station in the
Bay over the period from 1952 to 1964. These data show a cooling of the sea surface during the
period from November to February, when the surface temperature is lower than that of the
deeper layers during this period. The surface temperature is at minimum in February and at
maximum in August The water column is most homogenous in March, but in April the
existence of a termocline can be detected in the upper layers. In October the thermocline almost
disappears due to cooling of the sea surface and the vertical mixing generated by the wind.
During the summer season the lowest salinity is found at the surface of the eastern section of the
Bay, while in spring low salinity water is found in the west. This reflects the impact of
freshwater inflow from the Jadro river and submarine sprngs. As a rule, the influence of the
freshwater inflow is not apparent at depth below 10 m.
The surface water of the central part of the Bay is under the direct influence of the Split channeL
The eastern portion of the bay is separated from the rest by a quasi-stationary front in the field of
mass. The less dense water, which is probably less saline as well, leaves the bay along the coast
of the island of Ciovo. The temperature minimum of the deeper water layers in the central part
of the bay during the summer has been excpalined in terms of upweling generated by the wind,
suggesting that transport from the Split channel into the bay predominates in the bottom layer.

Br=F and Split channel
The Brac Channel spreads between the mainland and the Bran Island. It is bordered by the line
between the small town Stobrec and Gomilica cape on the southwestem island coast, and by the
line St Rok to Makarska in the southeast The channel is narrowest between Pucik6a (island
Bra6) and the mainland (5 km) and widest in its southeastern part (13 kn). The greatest depth
(78 m) is in the most south-eastern part of the ChanneL
The Split Channel is a part of the sea between the islands tiovo, Solta and Brac. It is bordered
by the southern Ciovo coast in the northwest, by a line that over the small islands Fumija,
Kraljevac and Zaprinovac cliff stretches to the small islands Klude and Vei Drvenik A line
nmning from Veli Drvenik across the cape Obinucki rt to golta, along the northem golta coast
and through the Split Strait to the cape Zglav borders it in the southwest and south. Its eastern
border is the line connectirlg the Gomilica cape on the Brac Island and Stobrec on the mainland.
The greatest depths were recorded in front of the island Veli Drvenik in the western channel part
(68 m); eastward the depths are smaller ( on the average 50 to 57 m). About 300 m long shoal
Mlin stretches between the westem Solta part and tiovo (0-2 m the shallowest point). There is a
large submarine erection between the Gomilica Cape and Stobre witb avage 15 to 20 m deep
sea over it (9 m the shallowest point).
Water mass circulation and vrevailin! currents
Movement of water masses in the Split channel and Brac channel is mainly westward, and forms
part of the general current pattern of the Adriatic. Surface currents are under wind influence,
especialy during the summer season. Therefore, "maestral" the predominant summer wind
generated eastward currents in a surface layer, while the "bora" (wind from the north) generates
southward currents.
Current field characteistics of the Bra6 and Split channels were described after analyzing all
the available data on currents measured on several occasions since 1972. During the earlier
period currents were measured from moored ships over 24 or maximum 48 h. The latest
measurements were done in 1990 and 1991 by automatic moorings, so that these series are also
longer and results more appropriate for observaions of wind effects. Measurements from a
moored ship are performed under mainly calm conditions which is not the case with automatic
72



curTent inetes-Current measurement stations are so distributed to cover-a rather large part of
both channels. In addition, we had available a lot of the data from the close vicinity of the site of
planned submarine outfalL Ibis analysis will give special attention tothe  rents in front of the
Split town port and in the area in fiont of Stobrec where sewage outfall is planned to be built 7
It might be expected that the occwrence of wedward and northward directons are very
probable. These directions are in fact a part of the incoming current of general Adriatic
circulation along our coast Their fiequency is followed by the fiequency of eastward and
southeastward directions which are very likely a compensatory counter cmrent, prevailmg m the
bottom layer as distinct from the wetward directions which mainly occur m the surface layer.
Westward directions are particularly frequent in winter, -whereas eastward and westward
directions probabilty is very similar for summer. It is important that the highest current values
are mainly related to westward directions coinciding in time with maximum frequencies of these
directions. So, for example, the greatest cumrent speed of about 50 cm s-I was recorded at the
station in ftont of the town port on 22 and 23 November 1972 when westward directon
frequency amounted as high as to 49%/o. On the other hand the lowest observed most probable
current speed was recorded from the same station when the eastward direction is highly
probable. It may be concluded that fiom the viewpoint of sea water tsanport and its
charactrics, westward flow, that is the current to the western quadrant is most importint m
the areas in fiont of Split harbor and Stobrze.
The resultant currents amount up to 50 cm se with the most frequent values between 10 and 20
cm7l. The highest value of mean daily resultant of all the data collected by now was 47 cm s-l
and was recorded in front of the Split town porL Mean current speeds are bighest in the surface
layer, ranging fiom 8 to 20 cm s7l. Current speed decreases with depth to be 6 to 11 cm s7l near
the bottom. Of all the measmrements ever since 1972 resultant surfiace cmrent of eastward
direction was recorded on only one occasion; all other measurements showed suce currnts of
westward direction suggesting extremely high probability of westward flow. Frequently, surface
currents have opposite directions of bottom currents which may be accounted for by
compenstory mechanisms This situation occurs particularly under the conditions of strong
"jugo" wind forcing an onshore surface flow in the area of Split and Stobrec which is
compensated by an offshore current towards the south in deeper layes
The highest speeds occur im autumn and winter months as a consequence of stronger wind
forcing. So, maximum recorded speeds in the study area vary about 60 cm s-l occmring in the
surface layer what points to the fact that they are due to wind forcing.
Even though wmd speed is lower in summer than in winter wind forcing is more obvious. This
is due to the fact that momentum of motion is transferred to a considerably shallower sea water
layer in summer that is only to the layer down to the thermocline owing to summer stratification.
In summer, surface flow completely follows wind forcing as shown by the available data. To
conclude, summer wind induces the flow whose direction fuUy agrees with the wind direction.
Under "bora" conditions the flow is of offshore direction and under "jugo" it is of westward
direction with an onshore component The most fiequent summer wind (maestral), which locally
blows from the southwest, forces surface flow along the northern coast of the Brac island of,
generally, eastward direction.
Under summer conditions with poor wind the flow is relatively poor, as well, in front of
Stobrec; with a tendency to be modified by bottom topography. As it is wenl known, a shoal in
73



this area has depth not exceeding 10 m in its central part It seems that the current field eddy
occurs and that its position is determined by the position and magnitude of the shoaL
On-shore winds generated surface currents are caused by 'maestral" wind and the south and
south-eastern wind. While the frequencies of the "maestral in the summner season is high, the
fiequencies of the south and south-easten winds are low. The sout-east wind, has a high
fiequency in all seasons except the summer and is much stronger than the south or "maestmal"
winds-
Off-shore winds generated surface curTents are induced by northern winds (N, NE, NW) and the
-mean yearly frequency are 16.1 %, 24.5 %/o, and 5.1 % respectively. Long-shore currents, which
can be regarded as favorable for the outfalls operation, are induced by easterly and westerly
winds, and the mean yearly frequencies are 13.7 % and 3.5 % respectively. It can be concluded
that on average more than 60 % of the total surface current frequencies are favorable (off-shore
or parallel to the shore line) with respect to the outfall design.
Temperature and salinity
Temporal changes of sea water temperature in the Brac and Split Channels may be presented on
the basis of data collected from two stations, Split and Stobrec (mouth of 2rnovnica River)
between July 1972 and August 1973, and 10 stations in September 1990 (Figure 2.7a) and 14
stations in April 1991 (Figure 2.7b).
A temperature gradient was marked at both stations in July 1972, disappearing gradually in
August, September and November due to vertical water mixing. The entire water column was
isothermal at the station in front of Split during the late autumn and winter. Temperature
inversion, with the surface colder than deeper layers, was recorded from the station in front of
StobreL. Surface layers were again heated in March so that temperature gradient was pronounced
in warmer months. There was a thermocline between 10 and 20 m in August 1973.
The research carried out in September 1990 and April 1991 shonwed temperature stratification
with the thermocline between 10 and 20 m in the wider area of Brac and Split channels in
September. In April the vertical isothermy was present almost throughout the study area No
horizontal temperature gradient was recorded from the surface layer (0.5 m) of the Split and
Brac channels.
Salinity distribution at the surface of the Brac and Split channels shows that the Cetina fresh
water effects are limited to the eastern part of the Brac Channel at the end of summer
(September 1990) whereas only a narrow belt between Dugi Rat and Stobrec has lower salinity
at the beginning of spring (April 1991 ._The shape of isolines suggests prevailing surface east-
westward flow which was more pronounced in April 1991 than in September 1990.
Higher or lower sea water density or at depends on temperature and salinity and is affected more
by either former or latter parameter. Temporal variations of at at stations in front of the town
Split and Stobrec in 1972/73 in dictated that the stratification is pronounced at both stations in
summer whereas the water column is homogeneous in winter. In August 1972 the occurrence of
"upwelling" or rise of bottom water due to the inflow of the open sea water in the bottom layer
was pronounced at station in front of Stobrec. This phenomenon is indicated by the very well
defined isotherms.
74



The at data colleed in September 1990 fiom the coastal profile of other stations point to the
fect that bottom topogapby affects the sea water density isolines. This mens that the shoal
between Splt and Stobred affts he se of more dense watcloser to the.sface., 7
Ihe T-S diagrm, based on al the -available data from a wider area' of the Bra6 and Split
channels, -sbows verfical sratification im this area to Ibe -due -to the vertical distnbution of
salinity, which is particularly low at surface of the stations clOse to Stobre6 and Dugi Rat
stongly affected by Cetina runoffs and to a lesser extent by those of the rnovnica River.
However, this fresh wate is reaied in the nanow coastal belt which becomes narrower affected
by the jugD wind. As shown by the data on currents, "jugo" induces an onshore flow component
in the surface layer making the belt of fresh water along the coast still narrower. A comparson
of T-S diagrm for April 1991 to that for September 1990 shows-late spring fresh water runoffs
to exceed those in the late summer due to graer precipitation quantities.
Nutrients and oxvyen concentration
Most of the data on nutrient concenttations refer to the sea water close to the coast (Split)
directly.affected by urban effluents. The data collected in September 1990 and April 1991 refer
to the thorough area of the Brac and Split channels so they are better representative of nutient
loads in this area

Ammonia concentrations were equal throughout the water column in April 1991 and
significantly exceeded those from September 1990 (Table 2.6). Nitites by different levels
showed no differences between different sampling intervals However, the nitrite quantities at
the bottom of the Brac-Split Channel were significantly different from those in the upper sea
water layr  (Table 2.7). Differences between mean nitrate concentrations were not great with
the exception of the bottom layer means for September 1990. Mean phosphate concentrations
showed practically no differences either as to the sampling intervals or to the layers of the Bra-
Split ChanneL
As shown by the collected data on ammonia concentratons at the coastal profile of stations in
September 1990 the station in the vicinity of Split appears to be the source of surfice layer
ammonia. There are also some indications that ammonia is released by remineralization from the
bottm  As to the nitrates at the coastal profile Qf stations in September 1990 it is evident that
they originate from the bottom west of the staion in front of Spli
Records of nutrient concentrations characteize this channel area as oigotrophic.
Variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations, that is oxygen saturation, may be observed on
data collected from station in fiont of Split in 1972/73.
During summer (July, August, September) oxygen saation stratification occurred with the
100% isoline at 25 m depth. From September 1972 a slight oxygen deficiency occurred at the
surface, due to nutrient input by precipitations from the land, as well as at the bottom. During
winter, the entire water column was well aemraed and oxygen saturated owing to the good
vertical water mixing and reaeration. With the coming of spring oxygen concentration was
increased due to phytoplankton activity.
Vertical structure of oxygen saturaion, measured during September 1990 cuise along the
profile of coastal stations show that the oxygen saturation sructure differs firm that on the shoal
77



between Split and Stobrec. The sea water is oxygen saturated throughout the water column in the
eastern part'(Stobre-&Dugi Rat), whereas bottom layers show deficiency and surface layer
oxygen saturation in the western parts with respect to the station in front of Split Tbis is a
consequence of vertical distribution of sea water density in September, which prents mixing of
the surface and bottom layer water, as well as of biological activity of production in the surface
layers and oxygen assimilation in the bottom layers. It is important that oxygen deficiency at the
bottom coincides with the higher nitrate quantities.
Under the conditions of sea water stratification honzontal distrbution of oxygen saturation
shows oxygen deficiency in the bottom layer of the Split Channel due to organic matter input by
cunrents and sedimentation from the area of Split.
During winter months, when vertical sratification disappears the entire water column is well
aerated affecting disappearance of oxygen deficiency. Therefore it may be stated that temporal
and spatial oxygen distribution is prevalently affected by physical conditions in the Brac and
Split channels whereas anthropogenic effects have not yet become obvious.
Granulometrv of marine sedimentsr
The September 1990 cruises for studies of geological properties of the sea bottom included the
area of the Brac and Split channels from the line connecting Dugi Rat and Postira to the line
connecting the islands solta and Drvenik and the mainland. In 1973 the profiles along the
isobaths of 15, 20, 30 and 40 m along the southern coast of Split peninsula were studied in the
area of Kasjuni, Sustjepan and Katalinika brig.
Loam was recorded from the southern part of Split peninsula along three parallel profiles
vertical to the coastline. This points to the fact that this fine sediment stretches parallel to the
coastline and that there is a calm sedimentation area with no influences nor signs of bottom sea
water movements adjacent to the southern coast of Split peninsula.
Loamy facies with very small fine sand particles prevails in the northern part of the Brac
Channel, whereas the IV fraction (particles size between 0.1 mm and 2.00 mm) with some
ingredients of the I and II fraction (particles size < 0.01 mm, and between 0.01 and 0.05 mm
respectively) particles is prevalent in the southern parL Therefore it may be stated that the
loamy-clayey facies occurs in this area where, apart from terrigeneous component, due to the
relative vicinity of the northern coast of Brac Iland, biogeneous component occurs, as well.
The particles of the I and II fraction, with far lower presence of the IV fraction particles, were
recorded from the area of the Split Channel on the southern coast of diovo Island forming the
facies of clayey-sandy loam.
The distribution of particles in the sedimernt of the Brac and Split channels gives respective
sediment facies, which complies with the principle of basic and regular granulometric selection
with respect to the distance from the coast and depth. This area is prevalently an area of
undisturbed sedimentation with the dominance of the I and II fraction particles.
The structure of size fractions of sediment particles reveals a lot about hydrodynamical
properties of a particular area. Sediment is a deposit for a lot of substances of anthropogenetic
origin. The main processes of remineralization of organic matter also take place there. The Table
2.12 gives the fractions by particle size in the Brac and Split channels However, to obtain mean
particle diameter, as a common sediment measure which may be compared to some other
properties, cumulative frequency of relative occurrence of individual particle sizes was related to
78



particie size classes on a probe paper. The size classes were transformd, if necessary, to obtain
linear relationship of probability and particle sizes.

If particle size reflects the dynamics of water masses in a particular area (greater presence of
smaller particles is suggestive of poorer bottom flow and uce versa, than it is obvious that the
flow is stronger along the Brac Island coast and poorer along the northen coast of the channels.
Isolines in the cental part ofthe Bra&Split Channel point to a possible cyclonic flow.
Transparencv
Transparency measured at station 1 (Figure 2.7) in front of Split between 1976 and 1990 ranged
between 5 and 37 ri. Extremely high transparency was recorded only once whereas the lowest
value of 5 m  was recorded several times. Mean value of measured values was 12.23 m and
standard deviation 5.74 m. Transparency shows here no definite trend.

2.2 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMET 
221. Terrestrial vegetation ^
Present vegetation has almost completely been ihe result of the thousand years of human
activities in this arLea-Coastal plain and slightly steep slopes are mainly used for agriculture.
However, agriculbtual land has been permanently lost as a result of the recent development of
tmws and residential zones. Steeper slopes and mountain sides have preserved the residues of
orginal vegetation cover, even though secondary vegetation of coppices and underwood extends
here and covers completely bare surfiaces. The coastal plain may have lost its original vegetation
already in Neolitic with first forest clearing, ploughing and finng
Primary vegetation of this area belongs to two plant-geographical zones: Mediterranean -
evergreen one and sub-Mediteranean - deciduous (Figure 2.8).
The Mediterranean - evergreen zone lies prevalently in the lower coastal part dominated by
Quercus ilex L.
The sub-Mediterranean - deciduous vegetation with the species Carpinus onrentalis Mill,
Quercus pubescens L. Traxinus ornus L and Ostya carpinifolia Scop., is dominant in higher
parts below mountain sheer rocks.
However, long term frequently careless wood exploitation has changed the structure of the
Kaitela area vegetation. The primary evergreen vegetation has been strongly degraded or it
almost completely disappeared. Therefore different degradational stages of this vegetation cover
the most part of this area
Deserted terraces were planted by pine woods of Pinus halepensis M'IL, cypress (Cupressuw
semprevirens Mill) and arborvitae (YThja orientas). Of wild growing plants Pistacia lentiscus,
Pistacia terehinthus, Phillyrea media, Juwperus Oxycedrus and SparWum  jwucem  are
encountered here.
Pine woods spread very quickly invading new areas of deserted antopogenic terraces.
The largest pine trees was planted on the Maijan Hill. Pine trees also dominate on the east of
Solin basin and toward 2rnovnica.
Very degraded surfaces with shallow and skeleton soil are overgrown by rocky pastures and dry
grassland characterized by a large number of species.
Strongly degraded surfaces of evergreen vegetative belt (on the west from Kastel Gomilica to
Trogir), where trees and coppice vegetaton has almost completely disappeared, are of the form
of spacious, deserted rocky land covered of and rocky grassland and Adriatic coastal rocky land
(Brachypodfo - Chrysopogonetea).
Low, alluvial plains along the nvers Jadro and 2rovnica and also Pantan spring were once
covered by wetland vegetation of which very litle has remained along the Jadro River. Wetlands
vegetation still covers some parts of the right bank and estuary of the 2rnovnica River and the
Pantan. Of wetland vegetation there may be found Sparagenwn eractum, Juncus mantimus,
Chlorociperus longus and the reed species Phragmires Communis Trin.

2.2.2 Marine biology
Qualitative and quantitative (density) phytoplankton composition was observed at stations in
front of Split and Stobrec in 1972 and 1973. Seasonal variation amplitudes of phytoplankton
were very smalL Phytoplankton quantity ranged between 52000 and 96000 cells/L
During the September 1990 and April 1991 cruises in the Bral and Split channels phytoplankton
chlorophyll biomas (chlorophyll a) was determined apart from its qualitative structure. Values
of chlorophyll a biomass ranged from 0.09 to 0.48 mg chl a mn3. Highest chlorophyll a biomass
was recorded from stations in vicinity of Trogir and Split The April cruise was realized during
regular spring phytoplankton bloom so that chlorophyll a values varied from 0.35 to 1.47 mg chl
-3
am 3
Vertical distribution of chlorophyll a on the profile of coastal stations shows high concentrations
in the surfaee layer of stations in front of Split and Stobrec and bottom layer west of Split The
area with high surface concentrations correponds to the area with higb ammonia (NH3-N)
concentrations and the area with high bottom concentrations to that with high nitrate (NO3-N)
concentrations.
The same samplings were carried out in the Kaktela Bay and open Adriatic waters (Stoncica)
during the same time interval. A comparison of obtained data showed Brac and Split channels to
be more similar to Stoneica than to the Kaktela Bay. Chlorophyll a quantities in the Kaktela Bay
were three to four times those recorded from most of the channels stations. Vertical distnbudon
was uniform in April pointing to intensive vertical sea water mixing. During April, production in
the area of the channels was more similar to that in the Kaftela Bay than to that in the open sea
'Stoncica).
Qualitative phytoplankton structure shows great variety throughout the area, pointing to a rich
but still "healthy" phytoplankton community. The area of the Brac and Split channels is more
strongly affected by precipitation waters than by sewage effluents of the town of Split.
Seasonal variations of zooplankton biomass in the coastal zone of the Brac Channel are shown
by the data collected during 1972/73 (Table 2.13).

showed the greatest concentrations in the channels centre in September, and between Postira and
Dugi Rat and in the Split Strait in April. This affects small pelagic fish behavior, that is their
concentrations were also greatest at these sites which are also the sites oftheir spawning.
Of plan1tonic fish stages sardine eggs and larve are dominant both by their numbers and
percentages. The analysis of spatial distribution of the total numbers of fish eggs and larvae
showed their greatest concentration in the area close to Stobrec in September 1990 and between
Postira and Dugi Rat in April 1991. Greater quantity of eggs in the area of the Split Strait in
April is indicative of the possible effect of incoming current from the open sea to this area.
The analysis of benthic flora may be used as a good indicator of pollution state of a particular
area. This particularly applies to three principal systematic algal groups: RHODOPHYTA (red
algae), PHAEOPHYTA (brown algae) and CHLOROPHYTA (green algae). The group
CHLOROPHYTA is most tolerant to pollution and eutrophication whereas PHAEOPHYTA are
least tolerant
The phytobeathos of the Split peninsula was studied in 1973/74. Two transects have been
chosen, Zvoncac and Stobrec. During the 1977/78 research algae were determined from Zvoncac
and Katalini6a brig transects (Table 2.14).

The greatest changes in the stucttre of phytobenthic settlements of the coastal channel part were
fomnd at the Zvon6ac tnmsect (Split) where the number of species was considerably   er than
on other fancts Recorded species mainly prefeiru iophied water most fiequenly polluted
by ehemicals. The changes at Stobre6 tnact were not of that intensity. A considerably greater
number of species was recorded fiom the fansacts of the southern tiovo coast and western Brac
coast It is also important that no nyirophilous species were found which is indicative of the fact
that the area of Brae and t!iovo have not yet been under the man-made impact
Faunal material was also collected during the research oif the Braa and Split channels. It is
qualitatively presented by systematic categories.

Studies of qualitaive stucture of zoological component of bionomic steps of supralittoral,
mediloittoral and inhfalittoral down to 30 m depth at the transacts Split (Zvoncac), Stobrec
(southern side), tiovo (southern side) and Brac (northern side) were carried out as a part of the
complex research in September 1990.
The transact on the southern side of Liovo is marked by the number and diversity of species
preset there (112), followed by the tansact along the northern side of the Bra6 Island (96)
whereas the data for the transacts in Split (ZvondacX76) and Stobrea (75) were very similar and
slightly poorer (Table 2.17).

The transact along the southern side of tiovo is far from any pollution source and is exposed to
a permanent inflow of the sea water carried by current and to waves resulting in the richness and
diversity of zoological element Similar applies to the transact near Brat. However, the areas of
Split and Stobrec are affected by municipal effluents. The adverse effects are manifested as poor
zoological element of medioli켾oral and upper infmalittoral in the area of Split and Stobrec, where
the changes in floral and faunal structure have already been recorded.
2.2.3. Fisheries, places of special interest for spawing and nursery grounds of commercial
important species
The most important commercial pelagic species in the area are sardina (Sarina pilckardus
Walb), anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.), while demersal species are silver hake (Merluccius
merluccius), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), boops (Boops boops) and Maena smarts.
The usual positions for traditional fishing under lamplight of sardinas and anchovies are shown
on Figure 2.9. The average yearly yield of these species for the past period was estimated at 500
t for the Kastela Bay and at 2000 t for Brac-Split channels, while at present time was estimated
at 50 and 1500 t respectively.
The trawl fishing is forbidden over the entire area of Kastela Bay, while in Brad-Split channels
is forbidden in the 1 Nm wide coastal strip and in the area between Stobrec and Supetar (Figure
2.10). According to the recently adopted regulation (NN 46/1996) trawling is allowed in the
period from 1 October until 31 March from 5.00 am. to 10.00 p.m in Wednesday and Thursday
only. There ara no information on yearly yield.
The Kastela Bay is the spawning area for sardina and anchovy, but not Brad and Split Recently
was discovered that species Lithognathus mormyrus, L. was spawed during June and July at
northeastem coast of Liovo island (Kraljevic et al., 1992).
Estuaries of Jadro river and Pantana spring are the most important nursery grounds for sardines
and anchovies, and very probably for other marine species. A similar situation should be at the
estuary of rnovica river, but there are not adequate information.
2.2.4. Rare or endangered species and sensitive habitats
So far, no rare or endangered species and sensitive habitats are identified in the area.
2.2.5. Quality of receiving waters
Quality of receiving marine waters could be expressed in terms of the levels of pollutants
concentrations in different components of marine ecosystems, as well as a health of the marine
ecosystems. Both way, in describing the present and past trends in quality of marine waters, are
used in this report.
Kaftela Bay
The Kastela Bay has been used as a recipient of the total amount of untreated urban waste waters
of Trogir, Kastela, Solin, and about 40 % of the total amount of the town of Split, as well as
total, partially treated, industrial waste waters of the whole industry in the region. This kdnd of
pollution, together with airborne pollution and drainage from the urban and agricultural areas
affect the marine ecosystems.

An eutrophication phenomenon in the Bay is very well developed. Results of the analyses of
long-term data senes of dissolved oxygen, nutrients, transparency and phytoplankton have
shown a cortinuos increase of the eutrophication in the Bay. While the concentration of oxygen
in the euphotic layer increases due to a higher phytoplankton productivity, iD the bottom layer it
decreases as a result of the activity of heterotrophic bacteria (Figure 2.11). The
nitrogen/phosporus ratio in sea water has decreased, and today is much lower than in the open
sea. From the Secchi-disc data it is clear that transparency has also decreased for the last three
decade (Figure 2.12). Primary production as well phytoplankton biomass has also increased
* (Figure 2.13). The stucture of phytoplankton community has been changed and dinofllagelate
species have become dominant rather than diatoms.
The direct consequence of the eutrophication is the occurrence of mass mortality of marine
organisms which normally happened by the end of summer in the eastern, the most polluted, part
of the Bay
Microbial pollution of the Bay is very high. Dispersion of the pollution depends on winds
conditions, but almost entire area ofthe Bay is not suitable for bathing Figure 2.13).
Concerntration of mercury in the marine sediment is very high (1.95 -8.79 mg Hg/kg of dry
sediment), due to more than 40 years of discharge of waste from a chlor-alkali plant which was
operating in Kastel Sucurac.
The Bay could be considered as sensitive area because it can be found highly eutrophicated area
as a result of poor water exchange and a discharge of large quantities of urban waste water

Trogir Bay
Comparing to the Kabtela Bay, the Trogir Bay is much less polluted. A study of sanitary quality
of marine waters in the Bay, performed in the summer 1993, shows that the Bay is moderato
polluted by urban waste waters, particularly in the eastern and north-easten part This part,
obviously, is under the influence of urban waste waters of the town of Trogir and village of
Seget The distribution of indicators of feacal pollution throughout the Bay depends on wind
conditions.
There are no other available information which could be used for the characterization of quality
of marine waters in the Bay.
BracF and Split channels
The most northeastern part of the Split channel and the northwestern part of the Brac channel are
under strong influence of high polluted city harbors (it receives a large amounts of untreated
urban waste water). In this part of the channels the greatest changes in benthic communities have
been recorded as a result of waste water pollution. A number of species was considerably
smaller than on the westem part of Split channel and at the northwestern coast of Brac island. In
this part (Zvoncac profile) the group of Phaeophyta (brown algea), the least tolerant to
eutrophication, is represent by 11.6 %, while the group of Chlorophyta, the most tolerant to
pollution and eutrophication, is represent by 19.8 %. In same time at the profile at tiovo island
the percentage of Phaeophyta and Chlorophyta are 18.4 % and 12. % respectively. The changes
at the Stobrec are less pronounced than at the Zvoncac profile (Figure 2.14). A similar changes
were found in number of zoobenthic species (Figure 2.15)
The concentrations of heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in surface sediment sampled in 1990 are
given in Table 2.18.

The reported values are within the range of natural concentation for manne sediments from the
open Mediteranean sea, only zinc was present at a level which was twice of natural values. The
increased zinc concentrtion was explained by the discharge of urban waste water into the
channels.
The Brac and Split channels, in general, could be considered as less sensitive area because of
relatively good water exchange with open sea, they are not subject to eutrophication or oxygen
depletion, and could be considered unlikely to become eutrophic or to develop oxygen depletion
due to the discharge of urban waste water.
22.6. Sanitary quality of marine coastal waters and die-off rate of faecal bacteria
Split town port and Vranjic basin are principal faecal pollution sources, besides a numerous
outlets dispersed along the entire coastline of the studied area, since they receive untreated
municipal sewage effluents. The speed and direction of waste water spreading in this area and its
effects on the adjacent coastal sea is highly dependent on wind direction and speed. Split
recreational zones only partly meet the requirements for their use (Figure 2.16). The poorest sea
water quality was regularly recorded from Zvoncac and Bacvice, whicl may be attnbuted to
town port impact. Stations Bene, Kasjuni, Hotel "Split" and Hotel "Lav" almost always met the
requirements for their use. No essential oscillations in the number of faecal pollution indicators
were recorded during the period of investigations with the exception of 1986 when these values
were extremely high throughout the Split area. This was probably due to uncontrolled discharges
of material from septic tanks into the collectors in the close vicinity to the sea, which overloaded
the coastal area with faecal wastes.
Die-off rate of faecal bacteria (Tgo) were measured at different depths at the station in front of
Split in September 1990 and April 1991. The former measurement was carried out during poor
insulation (veiy cloudy) and the latter during a sunny day. Both measurements showed that Tgo
significantly increase with depth (Table 2.19).

2.3. ASSDMILATIVE CAPACITY OF RECEIVMIG WATERS
The assimilative capacity of a body of water was defined by Goldberg (1979) as !amount of
material that could be contained within a body of seawater without producing unacceptable.
biological impact". The word assimilation is not quite proper, therefore GESAM (1986)
replaced it by a word "enviromnental". The envirommental capacity is defined as a ability of the
environment to accommodate a particular activity or rate of activity without unacceptable
impact.
The determination of environmental capacity of the study areas to acconmmodate urban waste
waters requires rather more scientific information than is currently available. The capacity of
Split-Brac channels to accommodate the waste waters was determined using a numerical model
(see Appendix 2). The model was used to assess impacts of organic substances contained in the
urban waste waters on the oxygen concentration. The model was made for the 'steady state"
conditions, without the time component. It was tested using the existing data, which is not
sufficient, specially because there are no data for the summer critical season. It is, also, very
important to point out that the model doesn't deal with the changes in biological components of
the marine ecosystems which would happened as consequences of the urban waste waters
discharge.
Results of the model indicated that this area has the ability to accumulate the planned quantities
of the urban waste waters without unaccepted oxygen concentration decrease. Despite the
mentioned disadvantages the results were used as good indications in the decision taking on the
suitability of the Split-Brac channels to accommodate of the urban waste waters. In order to
confirm the conclusion that the Split-Brac channels are the best solution for the accommodation
of the urban waste waters, for the purpose of this reports the Ka-tela Bay, Split and Brac
channels and Trogir Bay are discussed in terms of their volume, sea curent velocities and
predominant directions and general physical characteristics.
The Kastela Bay is a semienclosed oval shape bay. Its longest axis is 14.8 km long, while the
shorter axis is 6.6 km long. The total volume of the Bay is 1.4 kn3, and average depth is about
23 m. The shallowest parts of the Bay are the eastern and western corners. The residual current
field variations and the water exchange with the Split channel is mainly wind-driven. The
average flushing time is about a month. The narrow coastal strip of the Bay is a highly
developed area with various uses (housing, industry, harbor, tounsm, recreation, etc.
The Trogir Bay, a semi-enclosed bay, as well, is much smaller than the Kastela Bay. It is 5 kn
long, only, and 2.5 km wide. The depth at the planned location of the submarine outfall is 25 m,
while the average depth is about, which gives the total volume of about 0.25 km3. The residual
currents (during the summer period in 1993) were very weak, particularly during a calm
weather. The average cunTent speed in the surface layer was 9 cm/s and at the bottom layer was 6
cm/s, while the predominant directions were N and ENE. The water exchange with the adjacent
basin, would be, therefore, very weakL The coastal strip of the Bay is rather developed for
tourism and recreation. Only, the north-eastern part is developed for housing (Trogir and Seget).
The Split-Brac channels represent a much larger water body than the Kastela bay. The average
depth of the Split channel is 60 m, its length is 20 km, and wide is about 10 km. The total
volume of the channel is about 12 km3. The average depth of the Brac channel is about 50 m
and its volume is about 16 km3. The main directions of sea currents in the channels are
westward and northward (measured in September 1990 and April 1991). These directions are in
fact a part of the incoming current of general Adriatic circulation along the Croatian coast. The
96



highest speeds occur in autumn and winter months as a consequence of stronger wind forcing.
The maximum recorded speeds in the surface layer are up to 60 cm/s -
In the summer, surface flow 'copletely follows winds directions. Under "Bua" conditions he
flow is of offshore direction and under 1jugo" it is of westward direction with an onshore
component The most frequent sumnmer wind "maestral". whicb locally blows from the
southwest, forces surfice flow in easward direction. Mean speed in the bottom layer measured
in September 1990 in the Split channel at a station in the vicinity of the planned submarine
outfall was 42 cm/s (minimun 1.5 cm/s and maximum 113 cm/s) The onshore curTent direction
(N) frequency at the bottom level was zeo, while at the surface level was 32 %. The sea currents
measurements at the station located in vicinity of Stobre smibmarine outfal  showed the
following: in September 1990 the average speed in the upper layer was 4.8 cm/min (minimum
1.1 cmts, maximum 12.6 cm/s) and in the bottom layer was 6.2 cm/s (minimum 1.1 cm/s,
maximum 14.2 cmls; the onshore current component (N) frequency in the bottom layer was 12%
(average speed 6.3 mts) and in the bottom layer was 20 % (average speed 8.1 sm/s); in April
1991 the average speed in the upper layer was 16.5 cm/s (miimum 1.5 cm/s, maximum 45.6
cm/s); the onshore curent direction (N) frequency 100/e (average speed 13.9 cm/s).
The coastal strip of the channe in its western part is mainly undeveloped.
The ratio of the volumes of the Split-Brad channels, Kastela and Trogir bays is 112:5.6: 1. This
makes the Split Channel the most suitable to accommodate of waste water, while the Trogir Bay
is the least suitable.
Sea curents, directions and velocities also favor discharge to the Split-Brac channels. The
predomnant directions are along the shores, which will result in the waste water not being
tasported towards ihe shores but removed from the area of dischage to a wider area The
secondary dilution of the discharged waste will be much higher. In case of the Kastela and
Trogir bays onshore direction of sea currents are significant, which could bnng the waste to the
shore. Some amount of the waste could be trapped in the bay. The accumulation of waste in the
bays would impact the marine ecosystem  In the case of Trogir Bay, due to its small dimension
it is impossible to discharge the waste waters far enough offshore, in order to preserve the
coastal water for bathing and recreation.
The depth of the planned submarine outfall plays the significant role in the selection of the most
suitable location. In the Split-Brac channels, the depth of the outfall is 55 m and 32 m
respectively, while in the Kasela Bay and in the Trogir Bay are 30 and 25 m, respectively. In
the of case the Split channel the discharge of waste water would occur well enough below the
thermocline dunng a summer season. The probability that the waste water would enrich the sea
surface is very low as the plume would be trapped below the thermocline and generally
dispersed in the water column. A similar situation will apply in the Brac channel and Kastela
Bay. In Trogir Bay however it is more likely that the will plume reaches the surface and the
waste water tawsported towards the shore by relative fast onshore winter-induced currents.
The present ecological conditions of the Split-Brac channels also indicate that this is the most
suitable environment for the accommodation of urban waste waters.
On the basis of -previously said, it can be concluded that the Split-Brac channels represent
ecologically the most acceptable solution for the disposal of Split, Solin, Kastela and Trogir
waste wates The advantages are:
97



- they have the largest volume;
- they are the deepest, what is very convenient for thernocline and for primary dispersion,
- they are not closed, so the outfalls could be as long as necessary,  -
- main cmrent is longitudinal, and so it will transort the waste waters of the channels into the
open sea (waste water will not stay in the channels);
- the influence of the urban areas of towns Omin, Split and Trogir is the least in-Split channel.

2.4. SOCIOCULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
2.4.1. Present and projected population
The nummber of ihabitants in the Xaktea-Bay area vaied in different iniercensuns penods, but
the population gowth rate has always been rather higb (Table 2.20). -
Population expansion reached its highest point in the intercensus period of 1961-1971-1981.
This significant rise in population proves that the Katela Bay is an attractive urbanized area
with the city of Split i.e. its coastl agglomeration, having absorbed a large part of the
migration. These processes took place in the period of intensive changes in the population
economic stucture (decline of agrarian complex and loss of rural population) and consequent
changes in spatial distribution of the population in widea gravitational zone. In the decade
between 1971 and 1981 the population growth continued, however at a lower rate. The
population growth rate decreased from 2.3 per cent in the period between 1971 and 1981 to 1.2
per cent in the period between 1981 and 1991. This is very important because such a trends leads
towards a gradual restraining of excessive gromwth which has already resulted m overpopulation
in the area
Table 2.20. Population according to censuses in the peidbetween 1857 and 199.

Some studies, done before aggression in 1991 and significant socioeconomic changes, are
predicting a further increase of population in the area to reach 376,000 in the year 2011, and
415,000 in the year 2025. After the trntion changes happened in the last five years it is very
difficult to predict the fiture developmen in the area. It would need some time to settle down
present difficulties in the economy and related consequences in the society.
2.4.2. Present and planned land use
Figure 2.17 shows the planned land use of the wider area of the Kakela Bay. The largest part of
the coastal strip is devoted for the settlements and recrion. Area for Touristic development is
also very significant Comparing the planned land use with present land use it comes out that
tourism and recreation are receiving much more importance than in the past New tourstic zones
are planned in Kastela between K. Luldi6 and K. Kambelovac, on the southwestern part of
tCiovo island and westward of Stobre6.
The planned submarine outfall in Stobrec is located in between the existing and planned toursitic
zone, while the Mavaritica outfall is located in the vicinity of the planned touristic zone on the
westen part of Ciovo island. Both treatment plants are located in the vicinity of existing or
planned settlement area of low density.
The planned main sewer collectors in the Kaftela, Solin and Trogir will be placed in a settlement
area of low density, while in Split will be placed mosty in an industry and services area.

3. LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
3.1. NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE                         -        -
An umbrella law in the field of environment is "Law on the Environment' which passed in the
Parliament in 1995. Different sectonal laws deal with specific subjects relevant to the
environment The Law on Waters, among other subjects, deals with pollution protection of the
sea from land based sources of pollution. In accordance with the law provisions a criteria for the
classification of coastal marine waters, as well as regulations on maximum permissible
concentrations of dangerous and other substances in industrial and urban wastewaters before
discharge into a natual recipient should be developed. Until the new regulations will be
adopted, old regulations are still in the force. According to the Regulations on Water
Classification (NN 15, 1981) coastal marine water could be classified in four categories ( I
category for shellfish culture, II category for bathing, recreation and water sports, m category
for fisheries, and IV category for harbor).
The classification of coastal marine water could be done in the compliance with 11 parameters
(Table 3.1).

Dangerous substances          Should be not present at concentration higher than
prescribed for each category
By the Regulations of Maximum Permissible Concentrations of Dangerous Substances in
Freshwater and Coastal Marine Waters (NN 2, 1984) the maximum permissible concentrations
(mg/dm3) of dangerous substances for each of the water category are prescribed. According to
the same Regulations the concentrations of dangerous substances in waste waters at marine
outlets could be 200 times greater than values prescribed for coastal marine waters.
101



At the mgional levels still is in force the Action Plan for Water Protection from Pollution of the
Split Region which prescibes the maximum permissible concenaton of dangeous substances
which may contain waste waters to be discharged into a public sewer system (Table 3.2). Waste
waers enterig a public sewer ystem should not contai: ilammable and explosive substances;
noxious gases (H2S, S02); nitrogen oxides, HCN, chlorine, etc.; waste wates from hosptals,
slaughterhouse, veterinary stations and similar which were not disinficted before discharge;
solid and viscose such as: as*, sludge, metal scrap, plastics, wood, glass, feather, -hair, meet,
chemicals, etc.; acid, alkaline and aggressive substances; other noxious substances. pH of
industrial waste water should be not less than 5.5 and more than 9.5. The discharge of industrial
waste waters mto public sewer system or coastal waters is allowed only after the pretreatnent in
accordance with an authorization for discharge.

3.2. NTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS
Croatia had ratified the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the MediterTanea Sea against
Pollution and Protocol for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution from Land-
Based Sources (LBS Protocol) ln the accordance with provisions of the Protocol Croatia is
obliged to undertake measures to eliminate pollution of the sea from land-based sources by
substances listed in annex I to the LBS Protocol (Appendix 3). Croatia is also strictly obliged to
limit pollution from land-based sources into the marine environment by substances or sources
listed in annex II to the LBS Protocol (Appendix 3). Discharges of the waste into the sea shall be
strictly subject to the issue, by the competent national authorities, of an authorization taking due
account of provisions of annex m to the LBS Protocol (Appendix 3).

3.3. EU DIRECTIVES
Council Directive of 21 May 1991 (91/271/EEC) concens the collection, treatment and
discharge of urban wasw water and the treatment and discharge of waste water from certain
industrial sectors According to the Directive all Member States shall ensure that all
agglomerations with a population equivalent (p.c.) of more than 15,000 are provided with
collecting systems f6r  ban waste water at the latest by 31 December 2000. For urban waste
water discharging into receiving waters which are considered 'sensitive areas" Member States
shall ensure that collection systems are provided at the latest by 31 December 1998 for
agglomeration of more than 10,000 p.c.
Urban waste water entering colecting system shall before discharge be subject to secondary
treatment or an equivalent treatment at the latest by 31 December 2000 for all discharges from
agglomeration of more than 15,000 p.c. Urban waste water discharging into sensitive areas shall
be subject of treatment by 31 December 1998 at latest for al discharges from agglomerations of
more than 10,000 p.e.
Urban waste water discharges from agglomerations of between 10,000 and 150,000 p.e. to
coastal waters, identified as less sensitive areas, may be subject to treatment less than secondary
level providing that such discharges receive at least primary treatment and comprehensive
studies indicate that such discharges wil not adversely affect the environment. In exceptional
circumstances, when it can be demonstrated that more advanced treatment will not produce any
environmental benefits, discharges into less sensitive areas of waste from agglomerations of
more than 150,000 p.c. may be subject (which need to be approved by the Commission) of the
same way of treatment. Only technical problems can be accepted for a longer period for
complying with the above mentioned deadline, but the longer period may not extend beyond 31
December 2005.
In accordance with the Criteria for identification of sensitive and less sensitive areas, sensitive
areas are, inter aha, coastal waters which are found to be eutrophic or which in the near future
may become eutrophic if protective action is not takn, and areas where farther treatment than
secondary is necessary to fulfill Council Directives- A marine water body or area can be
identified as a less sensitive area if the discharge of waste water does not adversely affect the
environment as a result of morphology, hydrology or specific hydraulic conditions which exist
in that area. the following elements shall be taken into consideration when- identifying less
sensitive areas: open bays, estuaries and other coastal waters with a good water exchange and not
subject to eutrophication or oxygen depletion or which are considered unlikely to become
eutrophic or to develop oxygen depletion due to the discharge of urban waste water.
Urban waste water treatment plants should be designed, constructed and operated and
maintained in order to comply with the requirements of the directive and to ensure sufficient
performance under all normal local climatic conditions. When designing the plants, seasonal
variations of the load shall be taken into account
The discharge of industrial waste water into collecting systems and urban waste treatment plants
should be subject to prior regulations and/or specific authorizations by the competent authority
or appropriate body. Industrial waste water entering collecting systems and urban waste
treatment plants shall be subject to pre-treatment in order to: protect the health of staff working
in collecting systems and treatment plants; ensure that collecting systems, waste water treatment
plants and associated equipment are not demaged; ensure that the operation of the waste water
treatment plant and the treatment of sludge are not impeded; ensure that discharges from the
106



treatment plants do not adversely affect the envirnment, or prevent receiving water from
complying with other Community Directives; ensure that sludge can be disposed of safety in an
environmentally acceptable manner.
Sludge arising from waste water treatment shall be re-used whenever appropriate. Dlsposal
routes shall minimize the adverse effects on the environment. Competent authorities or
appropriate bodies shall ensure that before 31 December 1998 the disposal of sludge from urban
waste water treatment plants is subject to general rules or registration or authorization. The
disposal of sludge to surface waters by dumping fiom ships, by discharge from pipelines or by
other means should be phased out before 31 December 1998.       -
Competent authorities or appropriate bodies shall monitor. discharges from urban waste water
treatment to verify compliance with the requirements of the Directive accordance with the
control procedures.

4. DETERMINATION OF THE POTENTAL IMPACT OF THE
PROPOSED PROJECT COMPONENTS                            -
The mamn positive impact of the planned -sewer system and submarine -outfls will be
elimination of pollution by urban waste water from the Kastela Bay and Trogir Bay. The Bays
are semienclosed and in the accordance with Criteia for identification of sensitive and less
sensitive areas of the Council Directive (91/271/EEC) concerning urban waste water treatment
their could be consider as a sensitive areas. Recovery of the Kaktela Bay will take some time,
which is impossible to assess because of lack of dat. For sure, the Bay will become very
inportant resource for further development, specially tourism. The elimination of pollution from
the bays will improve the enviomental quality in the whole area.
The planned sewer systems in the firrst phase (pretreatment of the urban waste water only) will
trnsfer into Brac and Split channels practically all the waste discharging at present into KIatela
Bay (Figures 4.1., 4.2 and Table 4.1).
The performed assessments and numerical model show that the two wastwater outflls will
have no significantly negative effects on the marine ecosystems in Brac and Split channels, nor
on the present and planned use of the coastl sea and land strip in the areas neighboring the
outfalls. Some local changes are expected in the iumnediate vicinity of the outfalls.
Since the wastewater treatrnent plant is planned to be built in several phases, it is necessary to
implement a comprehensive monitoring program of effects on the marine ecosystems with
regard to the present and planned use of the coastal sea and land strip, in order to enable a timely
decision on a higher degree of treatment, as required.
In order to make proper decisions regarding necessary treament and improvement of collecting
system Computerized Decision Support Systems in Coastal Water Resources Management have
to be implemented. This system will aid decision makers in the process of transforming data into
necessary information to solve unsetctred problems of coastal water quality management

4.1. IMPACTS DURING CONSTRUCTION
4.1.1. Collecting system, treatment plants and tunnels
Colectine vstem
The pipes of the sewer system will be mostly buried and partly placed in ihe tunnels (two main
tunnels with total length of cca 3400 in) During the trenching to bury the pipes machinery and
vehicles will produce substantial noise and dust, which will disturb neighboring population. The
noise will be much more intensive on liovo island dute to rocky ground, and much more
important since this area is very quiet with residential or summer houses, without any economic
activity. The impacts on local population and tourists will be more significant during summer
season when numerous summer houses located in this part of the island are occupied by
numerous tourists.
Trench along roads will disturb local traffic and in some cases will block access to some houses.
This type of impact will be significant in the older parts of the towns (especially in Trogir old
city and Kastela) where roads are traditionally very narrow. In this area construction of the
pipelines will be very complicated because excavation can endanger stability of houses. This
will have influence on the preparation of the work and increase of cost of the work It will, also,
at most places be required to replace existing underground installations (water pipelines,
telephone wires, etc.). In this case a certain number of households will be tempormy without
services of running water, electricity or telephone.
In same time the earth works will impact pubhic services and local shops activities along the
place of work. This impact will be common without any specific characteristics.
Connections of existing sewer pipes with the new constucted may lead to the leakage of urban
waste which could create health hazard for workers and local population.
Earth works will not significantly affect neither flora and fauna of the area because sewer are
located in the urbanized areas. Construction will not impact the flow and characteristics of
ground waters, but the flow of srface waters (draiage waters and sporadic water flows) will be
disturbed in the area of KaAtela.
The construction of transmission main will not endanger known historic monuments but in the
area of Sohin it could happened that on the route of pipelines some so far unknown archeological
monuments could be found. In accordance with transmission mains projects the pipes will be not
laid down in the ecological sensitive areas.
The rising mains of pump stations Divulje-Pantana and Lokvice are designed to cross the
Kaftela bay and will be buried and concreted. The trenching through Kaktela Bay will produce
turbidity, caused by clay and sand particles. This, however, will not last a long time, no more
than one week after accomplishment of the work, and will cause no sigmificant changes in plant
and animal communities of the Bay. The communities on the place of the rising mains will be
completely destroyed, but in several year time they will be recoverd. The taenching through the
Bay would have negative inpact on juvnile orpisms of commercial important species, if any
retain in this part of the bay. During the construction traffic in this part of the bay may be
temporary distubed.                        -
hnpacts of the construction of pump stations and storm water overflows will be similar to-the
impacts of tranmission mains. The locations of pump stations and overflows have been chosen
taking in consideraton local charcterstcs whicb could create difficulties in the construction.

Treatment Dwants
The construction of both treatment plants will create noise and dust by earthworks and
intensified road transport Civil engineering works at the treatment plant will have impacts as
any other typical construction, work. The most significal impact will have traffic to and out of
const-uction site. The impact of intensified road transpozt will be much more important on
tiovo island because this area is very quiet area without heavy trAffic and noise. A special
problem will be Mavascica area. At the Stupe area there will not be significant impacts because
in this are heavy traffic is common.
At the Stupe location construction of the plant will require replacement of existing small creeks.
In the rain period of construction it is very probable that rain nmoff over the construction site
will wash out materials and caused increased turbidity of Stobrec bay and Mavak;ica bay. This
impact can be temporary significant on aesthetic and ecological characteristics of the sea water
in the bays. It will impact bottom communities.
Surplus excavation mateials could be used for sanation of existing left quarnies in the area or for
earth work in the area when appropriate. The quality of excavated materials can be of good
quality for civil works and beneficial uses.
At the location Stupe there are electric overhead lines which have to be relocated. On the site in
the southern corner there are several houses which have been illegally constructed. These houses
will not impact preliminary work but can impact extension of the treatment plant in the future.
The location Ciovo do not have such problems because it is natural green area
Tunnels
The size of the tunnels (Stupe 2436 m, Ciovo 1851 m) and complexity of the work as well as
possible impacts require the preparation of specific environmental impact assessment study. This
study is prerequisite to obtaining a Location Permit in accordance with Croatian legislative.
The construction of the tunnels will have a significant impacts on local and wider areas with
respect to noise, dust, traffic, vibration, visual impact and disposal of excavation materials. The
amount of excavated materials will be very significant (Stupe 38500, tiovo 20500 m3). This
material can be used locally for fill platform at treatment plant site (tiovo), filling of quarries or
for beneficial uses.
Impacts of construction Ciovo tunne will be significant on both portals but much more
important at south portal in Mavascica area especially regarding traffic inpact These impacts
will be less significant at the Stupe tunnel.
4.1.2 Submarine outfalls
The outfalls are not located in ecological sensitive areas or ground of endanger and protect
species.
Since the part of Stobrec submarine outfall is designed to be buried and concreted, trenching
through Stobrec Bay will produce turbidity, caused by clay and sand particles. This, however,
will not last a long time, no more than one week after accomplishment of the work, and will
cause no significant changes in plant and animal communities of the entire Bay. The
communities on the place of the submarine outfall will be completely destroyed, but in several
year time they will be recovered. The trenching through the Bay would have negative impact on
juvenile organisms of commercial important species, if any retain in this area.
113



Tbe consruction works at the inner Stobre6 bay will be significant (big size of the pipe 1000
mm and big escavation work) and will create temporary local problems in use of the sea in this
ama. Dragged material (ca 1500 m3) bave to be disposed at the appropriate disposal site.
The construction of the submarine outfall at Ciovo island (0 500 mm in first phase) will not
crate burbidy as the Stobre6 outfall, but it will create much more noise because of rocky ground.
Tne lay down operation of the both outfills will affect the navigation of pleasure boats in the
area of activity in a short time period.
The submarne outfall on tiovo island will hamper trawl fishing in the area of submarne
outfall, while sardines and anchovies fishing will be mot affected. Stobrec submarine outfall is
already in the trawl fishing forbidden zone.
Assembling of the pipe and preparation work for laydlown (pressure testing, attaching of
concrete loads, etc.) will have local impacts. It is not knowa where this work will take place and
there for it not possible to asses impacts. It seems that Mavascica Bay because of the size and
oast line configuration is not sutable for such activities, wvile Stobre6 bay is suitable.    -

4.2. EIPACTS DURING THE USE
4.2-1. Impacts of the sewerage system and the wastewater treatment plants
The treatment plant tiovo have a size of 110 x 200m and its location is about 250 m fare from
neighboring house, but if necessary it could be relocated to be more than 300m. Location is on
the level of 15 to 20 m over sea leveL
The treatent plant Stupe have a size of 190 x 380 m and it is located ca 100 m from the closes
houses. At the southern corner of site location there are several illegally constructed house.
Location is on the level of 13 to 10 m over sea leveL
Imiacts on the air aualitv
Easily volatile gases of very intensive smell occur in wastwaters. These odours occur
particularly at anaerobic state of the effluent
Do to emnission of unpleasant scented substances at the waste discharge facilities, undesirable
changes of air quality are possible:
- in the operating environment of the waste waters treatment plant in particular the preliminary
works, where potentially septic waste water is first broth to the site. This include Reception
Chamber, Inlet Channels, Screens, Aerated Grit/Grease Channels, Cess Tanker reception
screenings
- in the facilities surrounding but much less.
the distribution of unpleasant odours in the facilities surroundings is affected not only by the
type and intensity of the scented substance but also by wind direction and intensity.
At the entrance to treatment plants the unpleasant odours are possible due to the processes of
anaerobic degradation in the sewerage system, that is under the conditions of oxygen depletion
in the effluent In our cases this is possible owing to the increase of soil and shallow trenches
temperature in summer. This means that the water temperature increase may accelerate the
process of organic matter degradation and consequently the rate of oxygen depletion in the
water. This problem is particularly pronounced in this case since the water is conveyed over a
long distance.
Odour is a highly individual perception and its measurements requires a panel of test persons an
a rather laborious test procedure. Therefore, it is very difficult the assess odour impact from the
waste water treatment plants on neighboring population. But, considering the locations of both
treatment plants in relation with the neighboring population, it comes out that the locations are
not suitable regarding the predominant nightly winds in ihe warm period of year.
Unpleasant odour problems can be created at the pump stations and impacting neighboring
population.
Noise and Vibration
There will be limited equipment at the treatment plants that will emit significant noise, like:
aeration blowers and power generation plant using biogas.
Vibration may occur in the rising mains and partly not in the teatment plants, such as the air
blowers and power plant Vibrations in the outfalls are due to air penetration in the pipes during
emptying and filling of the sewer. This is of particular importance for the safety of the
115



polyethylene pipes, since vibrations may cause concrete blocks to unfasten and let the submarine
part to lift up to the surface.
Leakaee
There are a possibilities of smaller breaks and leakage of joints elements of the pipes and
channels which would cause the polution to the ground. Such leakage would produce harmful
sanitary and ecological effects.
The extent of these effects would mainly depend on the quantity of leaked water. In the case of
smaller quantities the effects will be insignificant At this stage of the planning process it is
impossible to asses the importance of this impact but it should be avoided.
This impact can be very important for Kaltela area because of usage of ground water for
irigation. In coastal belt the leakage will pollute coastal marine water and endanger usage of
this water.
leakage from the treatment plant Stupe and incoming and outgoing pipes can significantly
impact river 2rnovnica which is claified as I category of water quality.
Impacts caused by insectsa
Sewage effluents and the waste substances they contain are very suitable habit for insects (flies,
mosquitoes, etc.). Exposed surfaces are particularly suitable. Since sewage effluents contain also
pathogenic microorganisms the insects are particularly dangerous as disease camers. Because of
the regularity in anti insects actions this kInd of impact could be considered as negligible
Imnacts due to the 2eneration of combustible gases
Gases may occur at any point in the system under anaerobic conditions which are feasible in our
case because of long trawsport of watewater. This particularly applies to the spaces closed to
prevent unfavorable odours to disperse. If these spaces are not properly aerated they present
potenbal hazard for explosion. This kind of impact could be avoided by appropriate design,
constmction and maintenance of the sewer system and treatment plants
Fire hazard on treatment plants are only relevant to sludge digestion process and related handling
and use of digestor gas.
Traffic movements at the treatment ulants
There will be significant number vehicle movements duriag the normal working day. This will
include cess tankers delivering waste to the site. This will be very significant during the initial
faces of the development of the sewer system, but in the latter development of the treatment
plants there will be significant sludge tacks taking sludge eak of site.
At the treatment plant Stupe the main access route to the plant will be via the proposed
industrial/warehousing development area and traffic willn ot cause problems. At the treatment
plant 6iovo the existing road to the location coming through Mavascica village which is not
appropriate for this type of tranwort, and another access road should be found.
Aesthetic impacts
The significant aesthetic impacts will have The treatment plant will have the significant aesthetic
impacts while major pump stations will have only minor impacts. Other elements of the system
won't have any impacL
116



The proposed plants stuctures consist manly of low buildings and tanks many of which will be
located below gromund leveL The tollest structures will be vent stacks from odour control, biogas
flaring and power generation exhaust chimmey. This stack: will be about 10 m above ground
leveL Aa -the (tiovo reatment plant is located deep in valley it Will not be visible from the
village Mavaikica or any local road. Treatment plant Stupe will be visible but as it is located in
industrial/vwhorehouse area. There for this structures will not have any significant aesthetic
impacts.
Health hazard
Health hazard to the local population from any of the component of the sewerage system
(transmission mains, pump station, treatment plants) is negligible (distance from the houses
more than 200 m). The only one how can be impacted are the workers especially at the treatment
plants.
Problem erase when workers are in contact with row wastewater. Another problems are entry to
confined spaces in the system (transmission mains and pump stations) and at the treatment plant
Solids disposal
Solid waste associated with treatment works will consist of: screenings, grit and sand, grease and
oil, and biosolid sludge cake. These solid waste will have impacts on environment depending on
the way of treatment and disposal.
For the first phase of treatment plant development it is proposed to instole a small incineration
plant for the incineration both screenings and grease and oil. If a modern incineration technology
would be used then the exhouse gases will not represent an environmental nuisance. Other
option is to damp waste of the first phase to the municipal landfill site.
Grit and send after removal organic materials within them will not have any significant impact
on environment and can be used for landscaping.
In the second and further stages of treatment plants development a significant amount of sludge
will be produced. The sludge will be digested at the treatment plants and will have long term
stability. If the sludge has a good quality than will not have negative impact on environment and
can be of beneficial usesin agricukure or silviculture. Such sludge can be also dumped on
landfill site if necessary.
Quality of the sludge is directly related to quality of the wastewater inflow to the treatment
plant The problems are created mainly by industrial wastewater discharged into sewer system
containing toxic and hazard substances. Any heavy metal present in wastewater will concentrate
in the sludge produced on the works and jeopardize the beneficial use of the sludge. The use of
polluted sludge in karstic area, as it is Kagtela Bay area, is very dangerous for the pollution of
fresh and marine environment
Because of restructuration of local industry it is in this time very difficult to predict impact of
the industry on the sludge quality.
Adequate agricultral areas in this region exist for beneficial uses of sludge. Since the local
population and farmers are not familiarize with beneficial uses of the sludge at the beginning the
will be resist to the sludge application.

Confirmation to existint and ,lanied land use
Cbaacterstcs of location area of the treatmnt plants are described m Chapter I of this report
As it was present  the location of . Stupe treatment plant is Already planned for the  onsruction
of the plant and because of that is not in contradiction with land use plan (master plan) The
treatment plant liovo is planned on natural greo area but it is not in conflict with other uses of
land. This are (deep in valley) is not suitable for any beneficial use of land (nanow and step
area). Some prblems might erase becmse of vicinity of neighboring Mavaitica village.
Distance from the first houses is 250 m.
4.2.2 Impacts of the submarine outfalls
The main direct environmental consequence of a sewerage outfill is the contamintion of the
recipient waters with raw faecal material (in case of untrated or inadequately treated sewage),
intestal microorganim  (mcluding pathogens), nutrients and other oxygen cousuming
substances. This consequences of waste disposal may be:
- reduced quality of recreational coastal waten;
- oxygen depletion and eutrophication of recipient watas, including excessive algal blooms
and fish kills under extreme conditions;
- alternations of marine ecosystems in the vicinity of disposal point;
- spreading of pathogens by wind.
Phase I installation at the treatment plant anticipated preliminary treatment only. The key
requirement for this phase is tbat there should be ""no visible slick" on the sea surface. Phase I
includes the installation of a primy treatment process. This will substantially reduce suspended
solids together with associated organic mater. In Phase m the quantity the waste water
treatment by the plant increased and the quality of marine eviromnent could be decreased.
Therefor, it may be became desirable to treat the wastewater to an unprove standard. Tis may
be catried out m several appropriate steps:
-  ganic reduction,
- desinfection of effluent,
- ammonia reduction, total nitrogen reduction and phosphorus reduction.
The HARO-3 three dimensional stationary model developed by USA-EPA was used to predict
impact of the submaine outfills on the oxygen concentration in the marine environment
(Appendix 2).
Sea water temperature
Sewage effluent disposal in ihe wider area of Brac and Split Channels will not cause any
changes of the sea water temperature.
Microbial pollution of coastal marine waters
The distance of the outfalls disposal point from the coast vwere calculated for the first phase of
water treatment development (pretetment of urban waste water only), using some basic
charactristics of the sea water, such as physical properties, prevailing curents and die-off rate
of bacteria. On this basis it may be predicted with relative high probability that microbial
pollution will not be increased m the coastal strip intended for recreational pursuits (Appendix
1). If a secondary treatment including the UV desifection of the effluent is applied the
probability level will be mucb higher.
118 .



The transfer of urban waste water from Kagtela Bay into Split-Brac channels and elimination of
all existing small outlet and septic tnks (by development of sewerage system) will improve
sanitary quality over the entire area. The expected sanitary quality of coastal waters in the area is
shown on Figure 4.3.
Oxvgen and nutrient concentrations
The preatreatment of only the urban wastewaters is envisaged during the first stage of
construction of waste water collection system. These waters which will be conveys through the
outfall will contain large quantities of suspended matter (180 mgll), the degradation of which
will require high oxygen amount (BOD5=180 mg/l): A considerable part of suspended matter
will sedimnent in the vicinity of the disposal point, whereas the rest will be spreaded to a wider
area by currents.
In the first phase of treatment plant development significant oxygen depletion will occur on the
bottom close to the disposal points especially in sunimer and early autmnn due to the organic
degradation. However, anoxia is very unlikely to occur owing to relatively favorable currents in
the bottom layer. Oxygen content reduction will not be significant in the wider area of the Brac
and Split channels. In winter, oxygen concentration reduction will be very poor. During the third
phase the organic matter will be removed fom effluent and oxygen depletion will be much
lower.
In the second and third phases of waste treatnent plants the organic effect of the waste water
will be reduced and any solids deposition in the vicinity of the outfalls diffuser minimized.
Long-term discharge of municipal effluents, regardless on treatment level, will very likely cause
increase of nutrient concentations which will later affect moderate changes in phytoplankton
and zooplankton populations and consequently the changes in primary production. The
important of this impact impacts is impossible to predict there fore a comprehensive monitoring
program was proposed.
All above mentioned impacts of effluent discharges will be much more less intensive at the
vicinity of tiovo outfal due to smaller amount of watewater discharged (equivalent population
Kastela-Trogir system at final stage ca 150,000, while Stobrec ca 500,000), higher depth of
discharged (tiovo outfall 52 m, Stobre6 outfall 36 m) and assimilative capacity of Split channel.
Sea water color and turbiditv
Waste waters will increase turbidity in the vicinity of the outflls discharge which will limit the
light penetration. Whereas these changes will mainly occur in deeper layers in summer, they will
occur through the water column in winter even though of far smaller extent
Waste water discharge will also cause the sea water colour change to a green yellowish.
However, this discolouration will not be visible in the surface layer in summer due to
stratification. This impacts will much more pronounced during the first phase due to high
suspended particles and associated organic matter content in the effluent, while during the third
phase wil be practically eliminated. This impact will be of less intensive at Mavascica
submarine outfalL
A gradual transparency reduction and change of the sea water colour will presumably occur as a
secondary effect of nutrient content and primry production increase in the wider area

Flora and fauna
Disposal of municipal waste waters will affect flora and fauna of the wider area of the outfall. In
the first place, the number of plant species will be reduced and followed by the species diversity
reduction with a considerable increase in the number of nitrophilus algal species.
As to the fauna of the wider outfall area, the number of species will also be reduced with an
increase in the number of specimens and biomass of individual species.
Dramatic reduction of both the number of plant and animal species and their total biomass will
occur in the close vicinity of the point of disposal due to the sedimentation of suspended
particles from the effluent
The construction of the submarine outfalls and elimination of waste water discharge by
numerous outlets located will have positive impact on benthic communities along the coast in
the area between Stobrec and Rt Maijan. The discharged waste will not reach the coast line and
the communities will be recovered. The recovery time to the previous conditions will between 5
to 10 years.
The commercial fish species will not be subject of significant impact of discharged waste water.
IMpacts on other ipresent and lpotential uses of the coastal and marine environment
Discharge of pretreated municipal waste waters will not impair the present quality of coastal sea
water. So, its presents and planned uses for recreation and bathing will not be endangered.
Construction of the sewerage system in the wider area of the present one, to which the waste
vates  now disposed uncontrolled into the sea, will be collected for treatment at central
ueatment plant, will contribute to the improvement of the prerent state.
The Mavascica outfall is located in the area of commercial fishing (trawling) so that the
decision to ban this activity in these areas will produce some small impact on this activity. The
Stobrec outfall is located in the area where trawl fishing is forbidden.
No data are available on the infective diseases so that there is no basis for any estimate of the
outfalls impact on their eventual reduction or extension.
Since trenching to bury and concrete the submarine part of the Stobrec outfall is proposed at
approximate length of 900 m, to the point at which the sea water depth reaches 12 m,
recreational pursuits will not be limited in this area. Anchorage, fishing an any other activity that
may damage the pipes will be limited but only at greater distances offshore.
4.2.3. Overflows
Part of the existing sewerage system in Dujmovaca catchment area is of a combined type. It
means that during the rainy period of the year storm water will be discharged by storm water
overflows. Only three overflows have been planned. All of them will discharge water in the
north port sea which is classified as IV category in accordance with the Croatian law.
Discharged water will have impact on sea water quality in this area
Study of the analyses of possible impact of overflow water was made as part of the project of
sewerage system Split-Solin /I. Based on that study it was concluded that overflow waters can
be discharged in the north port sea after the ratio of dilution of wastewaters with storm waters of
1:3 was accomplished. It was concluded that discharge of these waters won't have negative
impact on the usage of sea water of the north port and therefore this solution is in accordance
with the Croatian standards.
121



Ihis approach is not in accordance with the EU standards tbat require the determination of the
outfall fiequency and total volume of overflow waters durng one year period. Thenfre it is
necessary to develop simulation model of the seweage system which will be done in next phases
ofthe design ofthe sewerage system.   .       .                               - -

The most importat impact of the tnel wil be on the health of workems It is possible that
within the tunnel, that is a closed area, gases that evaporate finm sewers (methan) that are toxic
and explosive can be .accumlated. There is a danger for workers lives and danger of destuction
due to explosion unless respective measures concerning the accumulation of gases within the
tunnel and measures and procedures that should be done before entering the tunnel were
undertaken.
During the operational period tunnels won't have significant envirornmental impact The
Environmental Impact Assessment will be undertaken for this object and therefbre this problem
won't be further discussed.

5. ANALYSIS OF THE ALTERNATIVES OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
Before the selection of the optimal alternative for the sewer system in the wider area of the
Katela Bay, several alternatives were analyzed considering the total concept and the specific
elements of the sewer system. Accordingly, extensive investigations and studies of the
characteristics of the coastal sea and waste water have been carried out as well as the urban-
planning analyses, cLimathological characteristics, techno-economical analyses and
environmental impact studies. This process of the selection of the optimal alternative lasted more
than four years. All these analyses started from the present state, local, national and international
requirements, local characteristics, short-term and long-term needs, requirements and financial,
technical and technological possibilities as well as the available personneL
The adopted solution, and its realization in phases is considered to be optimal for this region and
for the present situation.
5.1. ANALYSES AND ALTERNATIE SOLUIIONS OF THE MAIN CONCEPT
Several alternatives were analyzed at the level of a concept The first analysis referred to the
sewer system, i.e. either combined or separate /I1.
Considering the fact that the greatest part of the existing sewer system is of a combined type it
was necessary to decide whether to keep the same kind of system or to build a separate system.
Consequently, a separate system was selected and the existing system will also be transformed
into this new type. The separate system was selected considering the ecological factors (better
control of the disposal of waste water and reduction of the storm water overflow), economic
reasons (decrease in the costs of pre-pumping and treatment), maintenance and reclamation of
the existing system (problems with significant infiltration, insufficient capacity of the present
sewer system, etc.) In addition, there is no sewer system in a large area covered by the cities
(more than 60%/), so that the separate system is more efficient for the construction in phases,
where the sewer system for fecal (domestic) water is built first and later the storm run-off
system.
As the result separate system was proposed for sewerage systems of Split, Solin, Kaktela and
Trogir.
The second analysis referred to the configuration of the sewer system as a whole.
Three basic possibilities were considered: (a) unique system for all cities Split, Solin, Kastela
and one part of Trogir (one treatment plans and one submarine outfall), Figure 5.1.; (b) a great
number of small sewer systems (a treatment plant and an outfall for each large catchment area,
Figure 5.2.; (c) optimum number of sewer systems (most efficient collection, treatment and
disposal systems).
Each of the alternatives was analyzed considering several criteria, such as the most important
ones:
- envixonmental impacts,
- technological efficiency of the system,
- functional efficiency of the system,
- exploitation of the system
- reliability of the system and
- economical efficiency of the system.

Appropriate study was produced /1/, /5/ and results of the study were discussed between groups
of  pets and interested institutions and organizations. The discussions were held according to
the present state and past experience, obtained data, requirements in accordance with Croatian
regulations, -and internfational requirements (Mediteranean protocols and declarations, EU
directives). The following conclusions were reached
Single treatment Plant
Cental treatnent plant was planed at location of Split community because Split is the far the
biggest community in the area and collecting waste water at one location in this area have been
economically and technically the most acceptable solution.
A unique system is the optimal solution regarding environmental impacts because all waste
water will be controlled at one location, one treatment work and one submarine outfall. The
treated waste water will be discharged in the Brae channel. There will not be discharges in
Ka'tela bay from municipalities and industries and full protection of the Kaitela bay from point
sources of pollution wiU be achieved.
The treatment plant construction, operation and maintenance costs will be minimum (cost per
m3 of treated waste water).
This alternative taking in account whole sewerage system has been the most expensive one
especially in the initial phase of the construction because it will require significant
reconstruction of existing sewerage system, construction of numerous pump station and high
operation costs of the sewerage system (waste water should be prepumped several times). There
are a number of technical objections to the aernative of single treatment plant: The general fall
in the Kastela and Trogir area is from east to west and significant pumping would be required
(Fig. 1.15.), there is no simple and obvious route for main pipelines from east to west (from
Trogir to Split), travel time of waste water will be too long which will result in septicity and
odour problems (length of main pipeline more than 25 lon), connection of the settlements in
Ciovo would be difficult to achieve ig. 1.16.).
Regarding operation, sewerage system will be sensitive to the malfunctioning which could
results in occasional pollution of the coastal waters.
This alternative has been difficult for the phasing of the system development and construction
because it requires, in the beginning period, significant construction, time of constuction and
costs in order to start functioning.
This is also the least favorable solution considering the existing state and the possibilities for
bzinging into accordance the interest of the four cities.
Several treatment plants
For areas of Split and Solin, based on existing sewerage system and topography (the possibility
of collection by gravity), the possible sewerage systems are /1l/:
_ the sewerage system of the catchment areas of Dajmova6a and Solin with the waste water
treatment plant situated in commercial port area and the belonging submanne outfall for
discharge into the Kastela Bay,
- the sewerage system of the southern part of Split peninsula (old city center) with the waste
water treatment plant on Katalini6 Bng and the belonging submarine outfal for discharge
into the Brad Channel,
125



- the swerge system of the catchment area of Stobre6 with the waste water tratment plant
situated at Stupe and the belonging submaine outfall for discharge into the Brac Channel
.and-
- the sewerage system of the area of Podstrana with.the waste water trcatment plant situated -n
the center of that- area and the belonging submarine outfall for discharge into the .Bra
ChaneL
For the area of Kastela, as a realistic solution, there has always been assumed only one sewerage
system with the waste water treatment plant situated in that area and a submarine outfaU for
discharge into the Kastela Bay 15/.
Also for the area of Trogir there has always been assmned only one unique sewerage system
with the treatment plant situated on tiovo Island and a submarine outfall for discharge in the
Split Channel /141.
The solution which includes several small sewer systems is optimal considering the economic
factors of transmission mains construction (savings in size of pipelines, capacity of pump station
nd pumping costs) and-the present state (no big changes in the existing system).
It is the least acceptable solution considering the environmental impacts (disposal in the bays).
Discharge of effluent m the bays would require full tertiary  V treatment to achieve the
necessary water quality in the closed bays. Kaela bay and Trogir bay have been dassifted as a
sensiive sea water 13/. As it was presented in Chapter 2 the eastern part of KaTtela bay was
found to be eutrophic. Impacts of the treatment plant on land environment has been significant
and it waS difficult to find so many appropriate locations for treatment plants.
Construction, operation and maintenance costs of the tetent work will be significantly higher
because several treatment works would be built resultg in higher unit costs per m3 of waste
water and higher costs becae trament level if effluent is discharged in the bays.
This alternative has been favorable regarding phasing of the sewerage system construction and
development because systems can be developed separately in shorter time period with immediate
results and improvements in coastal water protection.
Management and operation of the system wiUl be more expensive and less reliable (several
operation units-depots, more staff, lack of exprts and operational experience to operate such
type of work at the required consistent standards).
Optimal solution
Consequently, it was conclded to find an optimal solution regarding the economic,
envinromenl and other cntenia, so that after an anawss the alternative for the construction of
two sewer systems: Split-Solhn and Kaftela-Trogir was proposed and accepted (two plants and
two oufalis).
Regarding ecological impacts, this solution makes it possible to satisfy long-term environmental
criteria and the control of the waste wasters and, hence, the long-term protection of the Kastela
and Trogir Bays. With such solution there will no be municipality and industy waste waters
discharges in to the bays (point sources of pollution). The disposal of the waste water outside the
bays makes it possible to use the assimilative capacity of the sea in the bays for all diffuse and
uncontrolled -pollutants in this area which are and will be significant /31 (storm mnofl
agricultural drainage waters, fiesh waters from rivers, air deposit and others). This ensures long-
term protection of the bays with relatively low cost of the systems and plants operaton.
126



Treatment and discharge of the effluent by long submarine ouffalls into the Brat and Split
channels will not jeopardize water quality in the channels although waste water will be treated
only mechanically /13/. Study and simulation of the long term effects of discharges of waste
water into the channels show that there will no be reduction in oxygen concentration except
smal reduction in the vacancy of the diffuser and all Croatian, international ind EU standards
can be achieve. The channels have good water exchange and are not subjected to
eutropkication and can be classifed as less sensitive areas. Results of simulation are given in
the Appendix 2.
In order to protect sea water and performance of treatment works treatment of industri
waste waters at production site has to be instituted and trade effluent policy kas to be
established exceptfor biologically degradable effluent& It is necessary to pay special attention
to heavy metals and other toxic materials that can eventually be found in industrial waste water.
Therefore it is necessary to analyze the necessary pretreatment of industrial wasewater and to
strictly define the requirements for the connection to the sewerage system. These activities must
be completed before the construction and commissioning of the sewerage system has finished.
Solution with two treatment plants and two sewerage system was the most economical
solution regarding construction, operation and maintenance costs of treatment plant and
sewerage system (pipelines, pump stations, tunnels, and others) /10, 14/.
Split as the far biggest city and producer of waste water was the logical priority in the
problem solving process Based on previous studies and projects /1/ it was concluded that
Split should have the unique sewerage system and the waste water treatment plant with
the belonging submarine outfal for discharge into the Brac ChanneL It was logical that
SoHn, as the settlement closest to Split, should be included in the solution for Split and
therefore the unique Split-Solin sewerage system was formed.
For all settlements in the Trogir area as well as parts of the town of Trogr situated on tiovo
Island the most acceptable solution was the collecting of waste waters at the unique treatment
plant situated on the southern side of the island with the belonging outfall for discharge into the
Split Channel. Also logical and the most acceptable was to connect the rest of the town of Trogir
situated on the land with that solution in the unique sewerage system. One more reason to do
that are the small quantities of waste water. Since the town of Trogir together with adjacent
settlements must have the treatment plant and the belonging outfall situated on the southern side
of tiovo Island, there was a question of justification of construction of the separate teatment
plant and outfall for discharge into the Kastela Bay for the area of Kaktela. Conducted analyses
/14/ confirmed that the most acceptable solution was to connect the area of KYitela with Trogir
in the unique KaMtela-Trogir sewerage systen with the unique waste water treatment plant and
the outfall for discharge into the Split Channel This solution is economically, technically and
environmentally the most acceptable with small impacts on land and sea environment, and also
reliable and suitable under local conditions.
127



5.2. ANALYSES AND ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE PLANT LOCATION
Smce the adopted solution includes two sewer systems, i.e Split-Solin and Kaltela-Trogir it was
necessary to select the location for the teatent plants.
Snlit-Solin coIectine system
In the Split-Solin sewer system all previous solutions included a treament plant on the Katalinic
Brig /18/. This traditional location was considered with seemral other locations. After an initial
analysis 11/ of the locations and requirements to be satisfied, four locations were selected as the
best ones: Katalini6 Brig, Gizdauia, Stobrec quarry and Stupe, Figure 5.3.
Each of the potential locations was analyzed at the level of conceptual design including the
necessaly urban-planning solution. The analysis of each of ihe potential altematives impacts and
characteristics included-
- urban characteristics of the locations (land use, conditions satisfying the surrounding area,
cutumal monuments, etc.),
- enviromental charatristics (sanitary conditions, noiise, smell, flora and fauna, water
resces, etc.)
- position with regard to the urban and required infrastnure (electricity, water-supply,
telephone, roads, etc.),
- positions with regard to the recipient (disposal/outfall),
- position with -regard to the present and future sewer system as well as other micro and macro
location characteristics of the area,
- costs (land, construction cost, operation cost),
7 flexibility and reliability.
The altemative locations were analyzed employing the multicriterional analysis and the
Promethee method with 15 criteria. This analysis showed that the best alternative for the
treatment plant was the Stupe location, than Katalinic brig, Gizdarua and Stobrec quarry IlI.
Sensitive analyze of the multicriterial procedure was perforned and in all combinations the best
sohltion was location Stupe.
The biggest disadvantage of Katalini6 brig location is the shortage of available area for the
higher level of treatnent and very high cost of the consbuction in city center and the most
attactive part of the city. This location is favorable in reganr to disposition and collecting of the
waste water. Significant and expensive steps should be taken at this location to reduce negative
impacts on the surrounding area. Gizdarusa location situated on the coast should be completely
constructed below ground level in order to reduce negative impacts on surrounding area ant
therefore it is very expensive one. Besides, an outfall at this location will be very unacceptable
because of shallow sea and submarine reefs in front of the location.. A treatment plant situated
on the coast would have negative impact on the development of the rest of the coastal strip..
Stobrec quarry location is situated in the center of intensive urban development, and it is far
away from the sea and the possible position for effluent discharge.. This location is very
unfavorable in regard to existing sewerage system and their collection in the treatment plant as
well as for local population. Therefore it is necessary to conduct complex and expensive
measures in order to reduce negative impact on the surrounding area..
Results with regard to several groups of criteria were the following: The most mexpensive
installation (constuction only) is for Stupe location and then Gzdaruia Operational costs of
the system and treatment plant are the most favorable for Stupe location and then Katalinic brig;
128



In regard to necessary resources the most favorable is Stupe and then Stobrec quarry, In regard
to flexibility and envirommental impact situation is the same; in regard to the disposition the best
location is Katalini6 Brig and then Stupe.
In accordance with the Study,/If the Stupe location has been chosen as the best This location
has the smallest environmental impact on the area around the treatment plant and in regard to
lend section of the submarine outfalL Besides, this location will fit into the present state of
construction and planned development of the area. In all public presentations of the project, local
population considered this location as the most favorable and the most acceptable. For this
location sewerage system was designed on the level of preliminary design, including treatment
plant and submarine outfiall. Solution of the sewerage system has been included in the land use
plan and master plan of the city.
Kaitela-Troeir coilectine system
The sewer system Kastela-Trogir included the analysis of several locations for the treatment
plants and two of these were selected as the best ones, i.e. the valley near Zedno and the Rastici
area, Figure 5.4. Afier a detailed analysis the valley near Zedno was selected, i.e. near
Mavascice /141.
This location is on an abandoned tenrain. Unlike this place the Rasticnd location is well visible
and situated near the area intended for tourism of high category, partly in this very location /19/.
In addition the Mavas6ica location is more favorable considering the economic and ecological
factors.
In order to unite all waste waters at the Rastic location it would be necessary to prepump waste
water several times to a height of 50 m (Figure 1.16). Therefore the operational costs are far
bigger then the ones for Mavascica location. Besides, the constuction of trunk sewer through
the Saldun bay, mostly under the sea, would be far more expensive then the construction of
-tiovo" tunneL Therefore in regard to the construction of the sewerage network, Mavascica
location is more favorable. This location is situated next to the existing housing and in the area
of fiture development and therefore it is extremely unacceptable for the local population. In
order to eliminate negative impacts on the surrounding area it would be necessary to place the
biggest part of treatment plant installations inside stable object to make them invisible but it is a
very expensive solution.
Mavascica location is closed deep inside the bay (Photography 2), it is invisible and it won't
have impact on the development of the surrounding area, that can not be said for Rasticand
location. It won't be necessary to conduct any special measures in order to reduce negative
impacts on the surrounding area. Mavascica location, even though far better located in regard to
present and planned construction in this area, is not very well accepted from the local population
that always has negative attitude in regard to the treatment plant Therefore the phased
construction of the treatment plant and lots of effort will be necessary in order to explain to the
local population the importance of the treatment plant for preservation of the environment and
development of tourism.

53. ANALYSES AND ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE WASTE WATER
DISPOSAL
The protection ofthe coastl sea water bay as a combination of treatment and self-purification of
the sea, is the most common method used in Mediteianean area as well as in Croatian coastal
urban areas It is "treatment-submarine discharge" system This system is analyzed and applied
as unique tecbnical-tecbnological unit with all its general and specific characteistics. It is
possible because Croatian standards are recipient standard type which allow dilution of waste
water in the sea water.
The treatment plant effects a partial or complete purification of the waste water, but the location
of outfalL and its relation to the coastal area and its depth, while the sea, i.e. submerged outfall is
used for fiuther puification, so that the required standards of the open and coastal sea can be
satisfied. This means that the required sea water quality is obtained by combination and location
of the outfall and degree of preliminary purification in the plant The combination to be applied
depends on the-local conditions and on the results of the selection perfonned to obtain an
opfimal combination.
If effluent is discharged in sensitive waters it is necessary to apply the higher treatment level, but
if effluent will be discharged in less sensitive water then only mechanical treatment is sufficient,
similarly to the EU directive concerning urban waste water treatment (91/27/EEC).
Considering the possible effects of the common configuration of treatment plants, only certain
combination are possible and analyzed. Three basic alternatives of the installation of the "plant-
submarine discharge" system have been used. They are:
1. Treatment plant- total biological purification (or similar); outfall-minimum length (more than
300 m)
2. Treatment plant- total mechanical purification (or similar); outfall - necessary length
according to computation
3. Treatment plant - partial mechanical purification; outfall - necessary length according to
computations
Alternative I represents an extreme case in regard to the treatment level, and minimum level in
regard to the depth of the submarine outfall. This system is applied when assimilative capacity
of the sea water is small, like closed bays and sea water with low water exchange rate and
sensitive waters. The minimum length of submarine outfall must be 300 m in accordance with
Croatian standards. Effluent from treatment plant must be disinfected. It is important to know
that first 300 m of outfall are the most expensive part of the outfall because that is area under
stronger influence of waves and coastal activities.
Alternative 2 includes full mechanical or partial biological treatment which includes removal
from waste water of settling suspensions, floating materials, oils and grease and partly BOD.
Remaining waste in water is left to the autopurification processes of the sea water. This system
is applied when assimilative capacity of the sea water is good, like open bays and sea water with
moderate water exchange rate and less sensitive waters. In order to speed up autopurification
processes and make substances in effluent less harmless, the waste water is released using
diffusers, thus obtained high initial dilution. The computation of submarine outfill length is
primarily based on satisfying the bacteriological standard as it is the most critical one. By a
combination of dilution and the process of autopurification, the required bacteriological standard
can be satisfied with the length of the outfall being ca 1000 m.
131



Altemative 3 includes the minimum possible degree of prelimiary purification and maximum
possible length of outfill for the analyzed case. Tn order to satisfy the standard of the open and
coastal sea considering the aesthetic criteon, and to protec the outfill from getting clogged, it
is necessary-to use minimum mechanical purification to emove the floating matter .grcase and
sed. Thus the standard should be satisfied by dilution and sea-water activties. The computation
of submarine outfall length is primarily based on satisfying the bacteriological standard as it is
the most crtical one. This system is applied in case when assuimlative capacity of the sea water
is high, like channels and sea water with good water exchange rate and nonsensitive waters.
Each alternative has some specific characteristics, advantages and drawbacks when compared
according to the ranking criteria. But, each altemative must satisfy the sea water standard in
regard to short and long term effects on the sea water. In accordance with long term practice the
alternative 3 can be safely applied in case of small quantity of waste water or in case when waste
water is released in the open and deep sea (channels), i.e. wihen sea water has a high assimilative
capacity. If the sea water assimilative capacity can not accommodate waste quantities released
by outfal (if long term negative impacts are possible) higher treatment level must be used.
When solving the problems of the waste water disposal for Split, Solin, Kaftela, Trogir, all three
altenatives were -considered, i.e. It has been proposed that system "Treatment plant-submarine
outlls" develops gradually in stages Alternative 3 to be applied in the initial phase when the
waste water quantity is small; alternative 2, i.e. alternative I to be applied when the quantities
increase and when negative inpacts upon the recipient are possible according to the monitormng
of the sea water quality (when it is necessary in accordance with results of monitoring and
simulation data or other requirements). According to the previous investigations it is not planned
to have a long-term disposal of either untreated or treated waste water into the Kastela and
Trogir Bays as they considered as sensitive waters which will be continuously and increasingly
influenced by air deposit and other diffuse sources of pollution.
In order to make proper decisions Computerid Decision Support Systems in Coastal Water
Resources Management have been proposed and pardy implemented. Computeized Decision
Support Systems differ from traditional record-keeping and transaction-processing use of
computers primarily because they require a symbiosis between the users and the system in order
to be effective. DSS have a three main components: data subsystem  (static and dynamic data
base), model subsystem (planing models, management models and operation/control models)
and dialog subsystem. This system will aid decision makers in the process of transforming data
into necessary information to solve unstructured problems of coastal water quality management.
Results of calculations (Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) show that in accordance with the present
knowledge such results can satisfy not only present standards but even the new Cratian
standards (still in preparation) that are similar to EU standards, International protocols and EU
standards (91/27/EEC; 76/160/EEC).
The main advantage of such approach is in rational and reliable solving of the problem of waste
water disposal because dunng the initial period of the operation of the system the shortage of
qualified staff and resources for the system operation won't have negative impact on the
required level of sea preservation. In the initial period the problem of sludge handling and
disposal is also eliminated.. During the initial period the operational costs are minimaL After the
beginning of the system operation better informations about waste water quality can be collected
because waste wates will be united at the unique treatment plant, as well as about recipient
condition. Therefore it will be possible to better plan a necessary increase of the treament leveL
132



This approach is aba more acceptable for the local population that is gradually geting used
to the existenee of the tament plant Local population wimg notce advantges of Jhe
henfi cility of tie solution and will accept biggerfinlancial liabilites and the deweopment of
treatment woiks..
With this approach, during the initial period, the impacts on eco-system of the sea are bigger and
impacts on terretrial eco-system and the area in the vicinity of the treatment plant are smaller.
Increase of the treatment level will reduce the impact on eco-system of the sea and increase the
impact on terrestrial eco-system  and the sumounding area because of treatment plant
development, treatment products and solids disposal, Figure 5.6.
In order to protect sea water, treatment of industrial wastewaters at production site has to be
instituted at the beginning of system operation and trade effluent policy has to be established
except for biologically degradable effluents. Process of greening of industry has to start as soon
as possible.

5A. ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT PLANTS TECHNOLOGY
The selection of tecbnology for the waste water treatment for the Split-Solin sewer system
included two main alternives: AB process and a traditional activated sludge process /10/. hbe
pbased installaton program was designed depending on the development of collecting system,
the final effluent quality requirements and the treatability of the wastewater. Each alterative
included a preliminary design solution and a comparison after which the AB process was
selected as a more efficient one. Both processes are similar in the costs and environmental
impacts, but the AB process was selected since it ensures better construction in phases and
makes possible partial biological treatment, which is considered to be long-term efficient
considering the assimiative capacity of the Brac-Split ChanneL less sensitive waters /10/.
No matter that all conducted researches imply that there is no need for a higher level of
treatment, all installations were designed for tertiary treatnent level with INV desinfection in
order to determine long-term required area and other resources.
All alternatives require the sludge treatment to the level that enables its use for agricultural
purposes in accordance with Croatian and EU standards. The basic requirement is adequate
treatment of industrial waste water.
In regard to large excavation in the suTrounding area for purposes of cement manufachtring,
there is enough space for sludge disposal if it wouldn't be used for agriculture.. Sludge can be
composted and together with municipal waste used to cover solid landfill site. This option was
discussed in the municipal waste treatment analyses.
The two processes are identical considering the first phase of the construction with the partidal
mechanical treatment Since there is no unique sewer system and, hence, there are no reliable
samples of the waste water (combined system), it is considered that the final technology of
higher treatment level should be selected according to the results obtained after the operation of
a pilot plant It should start after the collection of the waste water at the plant after the first phase
of construction.
The present characteristics of the waste water in Split, due to great dilution, are of the same
quality.as the effluent from the secondary reatment plant during the greatest part of the year
(BOD5 25-50 mg/I).
The same study was not developed for the sewer system Kastela-Trogir so that the results of the
Split-Solin were used instead The same procedure to be used for the solution of this problem
was proposed for this system as welL.
135



5.5. ANALYSES AND ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS IFOR SUBMARINE OUTFALLS
The studies included the analyses of altenative solutions for submarine oufalls, such as the
atratives for the locations of diffuser disposition, route for the land section and submarine
section of the outfall and various typs of consruction for the diffusers and consftuction in
phases...'                          
These analyses were developed acording to previous oceamographic investigations, modeling
and computations (Appendix 1), taking into account the position of the teatment plant and its
construction in phas  (treatment Ilvel of the plant). These analyses also included the
requirements related to the use and function of the sea in the area under consideration.
For the Split-Solin sewer system the reqrements for the submarine outfall and diffuser
placement are not the same for the entire area of Brad Channel in the south of Split peninsula
firom Stobrec to city harbor, Fig. 1.9. In the cental part of that area of Brat Channel there is
shallow sea with submarine reefs (depth 8-18m) that disable the construction of submarine
outfalls. Therefore the possible location for the outfall are fruther east toward Stobrec or further
west toward city harbor. Considering the waste water treatment .plant location in the area of
Stobrec, the most acceptable location for the outfall was the area of Brac Chanel in front of
Stobre6.
Environmental requirements for the diffuser location (place of discharge) frm Stupe treatment
plant are relatively similar in the Brac Channel for the entire area of Stobrec (depth from 30 to
50 m) because depths and velocities are similar in the entire area. Depth is generally increasing
with the distace from the shore and therefore the disposal is enviroomentally more favorable
with the greater distance from the shore., FigI.9. Mixing and exchange rate of water are more
favorable toward the middle of Brac ChanneL Outfall route is favorable in this area because use
of fishing boats with the net is prohibited. Therefore there are no restrictions for the construction
of the outfal and the diffuser in this area.. Environmental and construction charcteristics of the
sea bottom in this part of Brac Channel are the same and thus don't have the significant impact
on the selection of the diffuser location.
Construction costs of the land section of the outfill have the biggest impact on the selection of
the location. The existing docmentation includes the solutions which were selected accordig to
multicriterional analysis. Within the Split-Solin system two routes for the outfall were analyzed,
Figure 5.7. The analysis were performed according to preliminary solutions for each alternative
/1/. Both routes are in the Stobrec area. The main difference between these two routes is the cost
of implementation vwich is significant and partly the ecological characteristics which are similar
at both outfall locations. Both routes are very expensive The route through the Stobrec Bay was
selected as a more efficient one.
Waste water disposal requirements for the Kastela-Trogir sewerage system on the south side of
the tiovo Island and this part of Split Channel are pretty much the same because configuration
of the sea bottom is similar, Fig. 1.14. Conditions are favorable because of significant depth of
the sea (50 - 70 m) that increases with the distance from the shore toward the middle of the bay
and very good exchange rate of sea water. Environmental and constuction characteristics of the
sea bottom in this part of Split Channel are the same and don't have the significant impact on the
selection of the diffuser location.
On the Ciovo peninsula two positions for the submarine outfall of the Kakela -Trogir system
were analyzed. /14, 5/. Distance between them is about 1.5 knm. Conditions are more favorable
136



toward the west because the sea is deeper and therefore conditions for dilution. Construction
conditions, costs and envirommental impacts for each of them are very similar. The selected
location is more distant from the small islands (St Fumija) and other downsntm islands in this
aquatorium, i.e. it is the location near the Mavascica bay., Figure 5.8. The diffuser is situated
within the area where use offshing boats with the net is prohibited. Outfall route through the
smaller bay Mavakica is more favorable because of the good protection of the pipeline on the
bottom and smaller impact of the waves and therefore greater reliability of the disposal system
and smaller construction costs.

6. PROPOSED MEASURES TO PREVENT, REDUCE OR MMGATE
THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PLANNED WASTEWATER
DISCHARGE SYSTEM                                    -
6.1. STRATEGIC PREREQUISITES FOR THE PROTECTION OF KASTELA AND
TROGIR BAY AND BRAt AND SPLIT CHANNEL AGAINST POLLUTION FROM
LAND BASED SOURCES AND ACTIVITIES
Protection of Kaitela and Troeir lBa
In order to ensure long-term protection of Kaktela and Trogir Bay, considered as sensitive areas,
it is necessaiy to:
- eliminate all outfalls that discharge municipal wastewater into the bays
- eliminate all outfalls that discharge industrial wastewater into the bays
- reduce diffuse sources of pollution (storm runoff, air deposit, etc.), and
- establish permanent control of pollution sources and monitoring of coastal water.
Protection of Brac and Split channel
The permanent protection of Brag and Split Channel, considered as less sensitive areas, in the
wider area of Split, Solin, Kaitela and Trogir should be ensured by the fullfined the following:
a) General conditon
I. Disposal of the wastewater via long submarine outfalls, and achieving appropriate initial and
secondary dilution.
2. Purification of the wastewater prior to discharge into the sea -by long submarine outfals.
3. Pretreatment, prior to discharge into the municipal sewerage network, of industrial
wastewater that can be detrimental to:
- the operation of the biological treatment plant
- usage of the sludge produced at the treatment plant
- marine ecosystems.
4. Elimination of all existing uncontrolled coastal outfalls.
5. Appropriate purification of storm runoff and overflow water.
6. Control of all other diffuse sources of pollution.
b) Construction of sewerage system
Construction of appropnate sewerage system (collecting system, treatment plant and submarine
outffal) would create conditions for the fulfilled of the mostly above listed general condition.
But its construction all urban and industrial waste waters generated in Split, Solin, Kaitela and
Trogir area will be collected at two treatment plants (Stupe and tiovo), treated at appropriate
level and discharged into Brac and Split channels via long submarine oufalls.
c) Design and quality of construction of colkecing system, treatment plants and submarine
outfalls
In order to ensure efficient collection of all wastwaters into the collecting system, it is necessary
to design and construct using best available knowledge and available materials and technology,
and local characteristics, to ensure high-qualty construction.
139



d4 Effient t maagement and mintenance of sewerage *szem
Efficient management and maintenance of sewerage system is the key elemet for efficient
protection of environment and sea water because the efficient orgaization, experienced, well
trained and adequately paid staff are necessary to ensure permanent efficient operation of the
werage sstem (collecting system, treatment plant, submarine outfal).
e) PublCpriicni-ton
The public (local communities, NGOs, representative of scientific community, etc.) should be
the main promoter of protection measures as well as a proofreader of measures that are already
undertaken. Therefore it is necessary to include the public in the development of entire project.
j) Monitoring and informaion
Ini order to collect necessary data for coastal water resources management and to inform the
public and all interested sides about the level of sea water pollution, discharges and activities it
is necessary to establish monitoring of sea water quality, discharges and all other elements
associated with the sewerage system and teatment plant (soids disposal, sludge use, costs, etc.).
An appropriate information system to inform general public and all interested party about all
activities that were or will be undertaken as well as about achieved results should be developed.
g) Computerbased Decision Support System for Coastal Water Resources Management
Monitoring data together with other relevant data by computer-based Decision Support System
(DSS) have to be tnsformed intD necessary information's to aid decision makers to take
environmental sound decision in coastal water resourcrs management DSS will aid to
scientifically anticipate the measures for determination of the level of pollution of sea water in
the entire area (simulation models), determination of necessary measures for the sea water
prtection (the treatment plant development, increasing the treatment level, correcton of system
operation), determination of measures for expansion of the existing sewerage system,
determination of other struchnal and nonstuctural measures for the protection of the
environment, etc.
By applying above listed it could be concluded that the sea water of Brac and Spilt
Channels will be protected from:
a) Bacterial pollution
During the initial phase (preliminary treatment only) the installation of long submarine outfalls
will be in accordance with the calculation of dilution and time of bacterial decay in order to
ensure required standards for the open sea (HI category) at the outfall location and standards
for bathing and recreational water (II category) on the boundary 300 m from the shore. To meet
these requirements the outfalls length should be 2600 m, length of diffuser 400 for Stobred, and
2050 m and diffuser length of 400 m for Liovo.
During other phases (secondary treatment) the protection will be ensured with UV disinfection
of the effluent and submarine outfall of such length that the distance of the diffuser beginning
from the shore is always greater then 300 m.
b) Aesthetic pollution
During the initial phase (preliminary treatment only) installation of screens, aerated geise/grit
channels will ensr that there is no visible slick on ihe sea surface.
140



During the second and other phases of construction of the wastewater treatment plant (Primary
tretment, Secondary treatment) the protection will improve by installation of settling tanks.
In order to reduce negative aesthetic impact it is necessary to install screens (6 mm opening) at
overflows, and grit/grease channels where necessary (at the-location of significant sources of
pollution).
c) Organic poliution
During the initial phase almost entire organic pollution will be discharged into the sea and
according to the calculation output and the results of simulation model it will be accomodated
without significant detrimental effects.   - .
During other phases of construction of the treatment plant (primary, secondary and tertiary), if
necessary, the organic pollution will be significantly reduced (from 20 to 99%/O).
d) Heavy metals and toxic materials
During the initial and all other phases of the system development, the protection of sea water
will be achieved by control and purification of industrial wastewater at the place of origin.
e) Nutrient content
The reduction of nutrient content of wastewater and therefore the protection of the sea water will
be achieved by installation of higher levels of purification and especially tertiary treatment plant,
if necessary.

62. SPECIFIC MEASURES PROPOSED TO PREVENT, REDUCED OR MIGATED
THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE PLANED SEWERAGE SYSTEM
The adve   effects of collecting system, teatnent plants and submanine outfials may be
reduced y respective measures and procedures during their consfuction, use and mamt r
62.1. Legal and administrative measures during the construction
The constuction of the sewerage system installations must be in accordance with legislation and
especially with the Building Law (NN 77/1992, N.N. 33/1.995) and other laws relevant for this
objects (Water Law, N.N. 107/1995).
The construction must also be in accordance with requirements issued by different authorities
such as: sanitary requirements, water authorities requirements and requirement of local
sewerage system organisation, requirements of harbour auirionties and roadbuilding authorities,
electrical supply requirements, requirements of other infiatructure organisations, location
permit etc. Construction methods and procedures are presented in Building permit
In order to constuct as fast as possible and without negative environmental impacts-it is
neesry to define the Implementation Schedule taking in account local requirements and
characteristics. It is also necessary to co-ordinate the constraction with all activities in the area or
activities that will be influenced during the constuction.
It is always recommended to contact the local population and discuss the most favourable
constrwtion method.
6.22. The collecting system
62.2.1. Measures during design and construction
Generd
To eliminate the dangers associated with the system the need for safety should be considered in
the design of such system. They should be propely sized, closed, watertight and hard enough to
the sustain all possible loads that may occur during normal operation or at damages. Sections
which cross the water supply mains are separately made so to avoid any contact of sewage
effluent with supply water mains or at a sufficient distance apart
Use of the most impervious concrete possible and consuction of pipes and canals with elastic
joints, leakage will be almost completely prevented.
Continuity of the operation of pumping stations must be ensured with the following: resrve
pumps and reserve power sources - diesel power generator sets at all major pumping stations
(Dujmovaca, Duje, Lokvice, Pantana-Divulje), mobile diesel-power generator sets or double
power sources at other smaller pumping stations.
The sewerage system should be planned as to avoid tbreatening historic monuments and passing
through ecologically sensitive areas. The same will be achieved with consulting and observing
the requirments of the services for the preservation of historic monuments in each town: Split,
Solin, Kastela and Trogir.
Design of the sewerage network and its objects should consider the planned urbanistic
characteristics of the sewer routes as well as planned municpal infrastructure (electricity, water
supply etc.)
142



In order to avoid negative impacts created by construction activities in tourist areas, especially in
Trogir and (iovo island, construction should be organize out of tourist seasons
Special plan of measure-for utilities supply should be prepared and implement during the
collecting system construction in order to eliminated the negative impacts on local population,
public and other institutions.
For the protection of unknovm historic monuments especially in Solin and Trogir area earth
works should be implemented after consultation with institutions responsible for protection of
historic monuments.
During design and construction period it is necessary consult Water authorities in Split in order
to avoid negative impacts on surface water streams, especially in Kaitela area.
Responsible authonties must establish legal act that prohibits any activity in the crossing areas of
raisig mains of pum station Lokvice and Pnatana-Divulje that could damage the pipes (fishing
boats with nets, anchoring etc.). The pipes position must be marked on both coast and nautical
maps and corrections made on already existng maps
The collecting system should be equip vith flow meters and pump station with control system.
Odour and noise
The problem of odour is solved by ventilators and filters for air cleaning. The problem of noise
is solved by burying the structures under ground and sufficiently apart from residential areas.
Noise associated with the operation of pumping stations can be reduced if diesel power generator
set is housed inside an appropriate building or noiseless power generator sets were used. This
should especially be considered for pumping stations Lokvice and Divulja-Pantana. Pumping
station odour control consists of ventilation and air purification pnor to discharge into the
atmosphere. It should be especially considered for pumping stations located within 20 m from
the residential areas, if possible.
Measures for prevention of health hazard
The sewerage system is built to safeguard the health of the population. However, some parts of
the sewerage system may be dangerous for human health if required measures are not
undertaken.
To prevent the production of aerosols, which may adversely affect the health of the surrounding
population, there should be no open areas in the entire waste water collection system.
Maintenance staff must be well training in the procedure for entry to confined space and control
other hazard.
Unauthorized access to the elements of sewerage system (pump stations, overflows, etc.) is
prevented by the fencing or guard rail, locking up of the objects and posting the warning signs.
Fire extin2uisbing measures
These works are not source of any special danger of fire and no special measures are required.
Prevention of accumulation of methane and other inflammable gases in sewers and pumping
stations will be achieved with efficient ventilation system.
143



Other measures
Existing collection system in Split is combined type sewerage system. In order to preVCnt
pollution aused by overflow war it is necessary to install screes (6 mm openmg) at the
overflows, and oil and gease separators if necessary.
In order to determine the real impact of these waters on the coastal sea water it is necssary to
develop the mathematical model of collecting system and determine frequency of overflows and
total annual pollution loads. Based on obtained results it is necessary to dimension ovrflows
and belonging oufals for overflow water.
It is also necessary to determine long trme pollution of storm runoff and its impact on marine
environment in order to anticipate measures of protection.
6.2.22. Measures during operation                              -
Negative impacts during operation of the system must be avoided by proper maintenance.
Prlerquisite for proper mainenance is the development of maintenance plan and its application,
as well as appropiate stage of spear parts
Maintenance of the system must be regulary and during the maintenance all necessary measures
agamist hazard health impacts to workers must be applied. Appropriate training of stuff is
necessary.
The system must be regularly wash out, control and repair if necessary. Especial attention should
be paid to matenance of raising main cssng the Kaktela bay, overflows and pump station.
Deposit and crust in pump station should be regularly cleaned. Illegal connection of storm water
to foul system should be eliminated.
Regularly control of flow in the system must be taken in order to control infiltration waters:
Screens on stormwater overflows must be regularly clean especially during and after rainfll
season.
The pumps must be regularly controlled and maintenance. From time to time stand by system for
energy supply must be controlled.
6.23. Treatment plants
Measures for irevention of air aNalitv imnairment
Two kinds of preventive measures against unpleasant odors and aerosols may be distinguished:
designing and operational. The former measures mean closing of all the stuctures which should
be aesthetically and functionally adapted to the environment in the best way possible or buried.
One of the operational measures is the forced ventilation of the entire indoor space. Ventilated
air will be released into the atmosphere upon appropriate treatment (using biofiltars). It should
include all elements of preliminary works: Reception Chamber, Inlet Channels, Screens, Aerated
Grit/Grease Channels, Cess Tanker reception and screens. In addition the row sludge processing
units must be covered and provided with ventilation/odour control primary sludge thickening,
secondary sludge thickening/dewatering, sludge blending and digested sludge dewatering.
144



Measures for reduction of vibrations
All the works that may produce vibrations such as: air blowers and power plant have to be
appropriately mounted on vibration dampers to prevent transmission of vibration to -the
surroimding terrain.
The problem of vibration of the outfals as the result of air penetration into the pipes will be
eliminated by the construction of an appropriate ventilation shaft.
Fire extiueuishinf measures
These works are not source of any special danger of fire and no special measures are required.
Hazard related to handling and use of digester gas are well recognized and current practice have
to be used so that this hazard is minimized. Usual fire hazards measures is necessary to apply in
accordance with low for all elements of the treatment plants.
Measures for Drevention of health hazard
The sewerage syseam is built to safeguard the health of the population. However, some parts of
the sewerage system may be dangerous for human health if required measures are not
undertaken. In general there are no hazard to the health of neighboring people from treatment
plants-
Hazard relation to the operation of treatment plants must be recognized and strictly controlled.
The control of entry to confined space must be strict Works operation and maintenance staff
must be fully trained in the procedures for entry to confined spaces and control of the other
hazards associated with operation of treatment.
Measures to minimized enission of bacterial aerosol spry have to be applied, such as tree
screens, raised sides to aeration tanks, and selection equipment that minimizes the generation of
spray.
In order to prevent accidents and possible detrimental effects on the population, the area of the
wastewater treatment plant must be fenced and permanent securty guard service established.
Measures for Drevention of noise
All equipment that will emit significant noise (like: power generation, aeration blowers, etc.)
must be housed in sound attenuating buildings.
Solids disposal
Solid wastes associated with the operation of the treatment works have to be properly treated and
disposed: screenings must be washed, dewatered and dispose at sealed landfill site or
incineration on-site; grease and oils must be incineration on-site or collect and dispose with
urban oil and grease waste; grit and sand must be wash and clean from organic material so that it
can be used for landscaping; stabilized biosolids must have long term stability and to be suitable
for agricultural or horticultual purposes.
Aesthetic impacts                                                                                           L
Appropriate solutions like tree planing have to be implemented in order to minimizing the visual
impacts and wind effect on the operation of works and improve aesthetic conditions.
Work buildings have to be finish in accordance with local building traditions and other buildings
in the area.
145



Traffic
Traffic to and out of plant must be properly regulated. New road out of village Mavac ica should
be considered in order to avoided all problems related traffic tbhroug esting inappropriate road
throu  village
Insect nuisance
Althou problem related insect (filter flies and mosques) is not problem for the proposed type
of plant usual contol must be considered.
Measures for prevention of noliution fresh and sea water against pollution by surface
runoff
In order to prevent pollution of fresh waters (river Irnovnica) and coastal sea (Stobrec and
MavaWica bays) it is necessary take appropriate measures against storm water runoff
(consuction of channels and settling basins).
6.2A. The submarine outfa
6.2A.1. General
To protect the submarine part of the oufalls from wave and anchorage impacts as wel as from
impacts resulting from various other activities in the namrw coastal stip, it is planned to bury
and concrete the pipes to the point of 8 m of sea water depth (have to be determined by design).
The rest of the pipe wiU be protected by forbidding all the activities in the sewer surrounding
that may damage it.
To avoid either vertical or horizontal shifting of pipes (as affected by currents or air penetration
into the system) pipes should be fixed by appropriate weightsL
Since the submarine outfll for discharge into the StobreZ Bay is passing through the possible
location of the future ferry port, pipeline must be laid deep enough into the bottom to protect it
from effects of possible anchonng of ships.
Instuctions for the outfal consDtuction will be provided by Port authorities in Split
To provide normal diffuser operation it will be placed on the supports and elevated a I m above
the sea bottom. A flange is fitted at the diffuser end to permits cleansing from time to time.
6.2.4.2. Measures that should be undertaken during the construction of submarine outfalls
As it was mentioned before, the construction of submarine outfalls won't have significant impact
on the marine environment In order to avoid and reduce assumed negative impacts during the
construction of submanne outfalls it is necessary to undertake the following measures:
- in the coastal area, the outfalU pipes should be buried and protected with concrete in such way
to cause minimum turbulence within the area.
- during the installation of submarine pipeline it is necessary to effectively and on time secure
the aquatorium (especially in the Split Channel). It must be marked and made public in order
to avoid accidents and to secure lives of the stuff on ships and workers that will perform the
installation.
146



6.2A3. Measures that should be undertaken during the operation of submarine outfails
In order to secure the planned opeation of assumed submarine outfalls and therefore prevent
negative impacts of the discharge of urban waste waters on mane eco-systems and to make
possible the usage of sea for planned purposes it is necessaty to undertake the following
measures that cam be classified as legal, technical and organisational ones.
i) legal measures
- responsible authorities must establish legal act that prohibits any activity in the area of the
submanne outfall that could damage the outfall (fishing boats with nets, anchoring etc.)
- fishing in area around the diffuser location (500 m) must be ban.
ii) technical measures
- the submarine outfall position must be properly marked on the land and on the sea;
- the outfall position must be marked both on the coast and on nautical maps and corrections
made on already existing maps. Changes must be announced for the public especialy before
the summer season starts,                   - -
- the control of accuracy of outfall operation and its maintenance must be done at least once a
year (in the beginning of spring) by autonomous divers or submarine robot TV cameras;
iii) technical measures
- the system of regular control of oufall operation and maintenance must be established and
carried out in accordance with technical and technological requirements of the construction;
- establish and organise technical team that will immediately intervene to fix any damage that
could prevent the planned operation ofthe outfall.
6.2.5. Tunnel
Since the construction of the tunnels will have significant impacts on local and wider areas with
respect, noise, dust, traffic, vibration, visual impacts and disposal of excavation materials it be
necessary to prepare a separate environmental impact assessment for both tunnels.
6.2.6. Organization and management
It is recommended to operation company that core team of operation staff recruited before the
works development so that installation can be used for training.
It is necessary to organize smaller team of chemist and laboratory staff for waste water
monitonng and establishing good trade effluent monitorng.
It is recommended to operation company to carry over necessary recruitment, training and built
up of the drainage system management and control team.
A study have to be carried out covering current organization and proposed organization (staffing
levels and training requirements) in accordance with system development (new treatment plants,
submarine outfalls and transmission mains).
Operational company have to bay necessary equipment and tools for appropriate control and
maintenance of the system.
147



6.27. Other measures and studies
1. In order to make proper decisions regarding necessary treatment and improvement of
collecting system Computerized Decision Support Systems in Coastal Water Resources
Management have to be implemented Ibis system will aid decision makers in the process of
transforig data into necessary information toDsolve uructuedproblems of coastal water
quality managemenL
2. Monitonng and collection of wastewater chareristics data (flows and concentrations)
including and storM water data should be established.
3. Monitoring and collection of meteorological and clinmalogical data at location of treatment
plans should be establishedL
4. It is necessary set up wastewater and effluent monitoring system at the treatment plants
(flows and concentrations).
5. It is necessary to organize monitonng of agricultural amd others land and crops receiving
sludge from teatment plant.
6. After installation of the first phase preliminary work, pilot studies should be canied out to
charactrize the treatability of the waste water and provide design inormation for future
process selection.
7. It is necessary set up study of sludge disposal outlets in accordance with local conditions and
needs including sludge management and disposal policy study.
8. Trade effluent policy should be established and strict trade effluent monitoring controls
instituted
9. Study have to be carried out to determine necesry tvratment of industrial wastewatr at
the production site and necessary steps for greening of industry.
10. Strict controls must be applied to setting and monitoring of standards for trade effluent
11. Prior to commissioning of the wastewater treatment plant, the sanitary landfill site for
disposal of sludge and solids from treatment plants must be determined.
148



7. PROPOSED RESEARCH AND MONITORING PROGRAMME
7.L JUSTIICATIN FOR THE PROGRAMME
The nature and size of the inveswmet, as well as its potential environmental impacts, requires the
good knowledge and understanding the marine ecosystems in the area, in order to avoid
undesirable negative impacts of discharged waste waters.
Numerous studies of the Kaltela bay have shoved that the Kastela bay is threatened by urban and
industrial waste and for is recovery would be necessary to stop the discharge the wastes. The
study of the Split and Brac channels performed in September 1990 and April 1991 has shoved
that the Brac and Split channels, even degraded in restriced coastal areas, due their relative large
volume and the circulation of water masses were found to be the best available solution for the
receiving the waste waters.
The research of the Split and Brac channels was performed in September 1990 and April 1991,
missing the summer the most critical season from the ecological point of view.
In order to confirm the conclusions based on the available results and used for the design of the
sewerage project, and gather further information necessary to evaluate the present state, it would
be necessary to undertake further investigations of the marine environment of the area. The
results of investigation are very important, also, for the decission on the final waste water
treatment level, which will be made later taking into consideration impacts of pretreated waste
water on the marine environment
149



72. AIMS OF TEE PROGRAMM
The main aims of the programme are:
to collect information on the dynamic of waternasses im the areas of the sobmarine outfals
--and in the entire chanels area during summer season, the most critical period fiom the
-ecological point of viiew and use of the coastl zone for bathing and recreation;
to evaluate the present level of the degradation of marine ecosems of Brat and Split
channels and Katela bay, using different physical (transparency, TSS) chemical (oxygen
concentration and saturation, nutrients concentration) and biological (str e  and
composition of phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteioplankton and benthic communities, and
primary and secondary production) parameters
to assess the present level of pollution by selected pollutants contained in urban and industrial
waste watrs.

7.5. COMbUTER-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR COASTAL WATER
RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
Compid decision support systems are intactive computer-based systems that aid decision
makers in the process of tansforming data into necessary information to solve unstruchtred
problems of pollution and prtection of the coastal sea waters in the Split, Solin, Katela and
Trogir region.
The main components of the DSS are: data subsystem, model subsystem, and dialog subsystem,
as illustrated on next figme.

Figure 7.4. Basic components of a Decision Support System
The data subsystem is directed to the acquisition, storage, management, retieval and processing
of data and it will be subdivided into static and dynamic database. The static data base will
include the physical, economic, demographic, environmental, land use, as well as other pertinent
featres of the system  The dynamic data base on the other hand, includes time series
information such as hydrology, wastewater flow, wastewater quality, sea water quality and
cimatologic data sensing.
The model subsystem is used for analysis, predicting and decision guidance. This subsystem will
include a variety of models ranging from simulation (collecting system, treatmient plant,
submarine outfall, sea water quality, etc.) to optimization models, which may have various levels
of sophistication-
The dialog subsysm, is the component of DSS which provides the essential human-machine
interface. Dramatic advances in software and hardware technology have provided the means for
158



the development of user friendly interfaces,-including high resolution color graphic, animation
and multimedia prestion.tain
Experience showed that decision support systems have been used in many areas of water
resources management to the, point that they have become an indispensable part of decision
making process-
Taking into consideration series of still unsolved problems connected to: the recovery of Kastela
and Trogir Bay; long-term effects of the discharge of wastewater into Brac and Split Channel;
the required treatment level; the impact of overflow waters; the impact of industrial wastewaters,
system operation, etc. it is considered that the implementation of such DSS is essential.
Implementation of DSS would make the long-term co-ordination of work and system
construction with aIl four municipalities much easier, the public will be better informed and
necessary decisions concerning progress of the protection of this region will be made much
easier.
By the implementation of DSS the proposed monitoring system could be efficiently and
completely used, as well as all data that should be collected during the project preparation phase.
This system will unite in one place all existing data and knowledge that are necessary for the
efficient management of coastal water resources.
It is necessary to mention that at the Faculty of Civil Engineering University of Split such
system is in the development phase.
T-he costs for establishment of DSS for areas of Kastela and Trogir Bay, and Brac and Split
ChanneL as wel as for towns of Split, Solin, XaAtela and Trogir were estimated at 395,000 US$

9. PUBLIC HEARING
On October 24th 1996. JVP Hrvatska Vodoprivreda informed the newspapers to inform the
public that public hearing of EIA for sewerage project will be done on'October 29th 1996.; for
Trogir-Kastela sewerage systern it will be done at noon in Ka쬽ela city hall and for Split-Solin
sewerage system at 6 p.m. at the premises of Engineer and Technician Association in Split
The newspaper Slobodna Dalmacija in its issue dated Saturday, October 26. announced the
public hearing.
At the public hearing in Kastel Sucurac that began at 12,05 and finished at 15,20 were present
the representatives of NG organisation "Lijepa nasa", representatives of towns of Trogir and
Solin, the president of the Business Chamber of the Split county, the representatives of
Mavarstica settlement and citizens.
The study was presented by its authors, and representatives of Hrvatska Vodoprivreda presented
general informations about the project.
Mr Pejakovic, the General Manager of Hrvatska Vodoprivreda OJ Split, began the public
hearing, greeted the present representatives and citizens and explained the purpose and way of
presentation. The purpose of the public hearing was to inform the population about the study and
to let them express their opinion about the planned project and the study.
Mr Braticevic greeted the present in the name of the Govermment of the town of Kasela and
emphasised that that the planned project has great significance for the town of Kastela and
expressed his hopes that WB and EBRD by the end of November will decide to finance the
project.
Mr Petkovic presented the subproject of the water supply of this area. Mr Ivanci6 gave brief
information about the development of the subproject of the disposal of wastewaters of this area.
Mlr Margeta co-author of the study presented the subproject of the Trogir-Kasela sewerage
system, wastewater treatment plant planned on tCiovo Island and submarine outfall for discharge
into the Split Channel.
Mr Baric co-author of the study presented the chapters concerning the environment and national
legislation, intemational contracts and EU Directive that concerns collection, treatment and
disposal of wastewater and sludge. He also presented expected negative and positive impacts that
the planned sewerage system and its installations could have on the environment
Mr Margeta then presented the alternatives that were analysed during the project development
and measures that were planned or should be undertaken in order to prevent or reduce the
negative impacts on the environment.
In the end Mr Baric presented the proposed program of the research and monitoring of the sea.
Participants of public hearing asked the following questions and stated their opinion:
KallelSm6urac
lvna Bucan, NGO "Lijepa nasa" asked the following questions: 1. Existing industry in the area
of Katela Bay is presently not operating and therefore it is not a polluter. What will the impact
of industry on the planned collecting system be if it is put in operation again, and will it have
impact on the quality of sea water? 2. What will happen to the coast in the area of Mavarscica
after the construction of the planned outfall? 3. Is the planned level of purification sufficient to
161



protect the sea water in which the wastewater will be discharged? 4. Will the wastewater of the
city of Split be purified in the same way? Will construction start in the same time on both
systems?
Miro Matijaca. His objection was that th project has the .sam  approach for the entire area of
the Kaftela Bay, when it shouldn't In his opinion, the main problem is the eastern'part of the
Ka&tela Bay. Therefore the problem of pollution of eastern part of the bay has to be solved in
order to solve the problem of the entire bay. Financial resources intended for the western part of
Kastela Bay should be used to solve other problems in this area
Boris gkara. He asked why the wastewater treatment plant (tiovo) wasn't located 1000 m to
the east? After the wastewater treatment plant is constructed where will the screenings be
disposed until the sanitary depot for municipal solid wastes is built?
Igor Novak, environmental inspector, Trogir. He is worried that discharged wastewater will
pollute the coastal sea water because only mechanical treatment is planned.
Tomislav tiZek, President of County Business Chamber, Split Has the estimate of operational
and maintenance costs for the entire system been done and who will finance it? He is worried
because the construction of the sewerage -system in the northern part of Ciovo Island wasn't
planned. In his opinion the secondary sewerage network has to be constructed as soon as
possible in order to eliminate cess tanks in the entire area.
Ivo Rokov, NGO "Lijepa nasa". Were any measures planned in order to eliminate methyl-
mercury from Kastela Bay? The level of bacterial contamination is only one out of !2
parameters for determination of the quality of bathing water. The problem of propagation of
radioactive slag that was deposited on the grounds of ex "JugoviLil" factory is also present in thie
area of Kastela Bay.
Veselko Andromak. The higher level of wastewater treatment gives opportunity for profit and
therefore the highest level of wastewater treatment should be installed at once. According to
Urbanistic Plan for Kastela the construction of the new road between Kastela Road (Kastelanska
cesta) and Adriatic Highway (Jadranska magistrala) is planned. Could this planned road be used
to lie the main sewer instead the old Kastela road (Kastelanska cesta)?
Marin Bedalov. NGO "Lijepa nasa"' The collecting system is the foundation for the further
development of the Kastela Bay but it won't solve all problems present in the bay (mercury,
radioactive slag). There is a worry that this system won't be constructed in planned construction
period because the decision about its realisation has already been postponed several times.
Construction of the collecting system will save local wells that are jeopardised by numerous cess
tanks which are permeable. He also point out that the citizens of Kastela are giving full support
for the Project.
Ivica Mivoncic, journalist. He is familiar with the project and he is supporting it. He asked will
the Mavarscica Bay be occasionally polluted after the construction of collecting system? Were
the institutions for the preservation of historic monuments consulted during the planning period
because a pre-romanic church of St. Mavro is located in the area of Mavarscica.
Tonci Buble. He doubts that the location for the wastewater treatment plant is a suitable one. He
suggested that location should be discussed at the meeting of the City Council of Trogir and its
displacement further to the east considered. He also suggested to increase the level of
purification of wastewater. He asked what would happen if there was a pump breakdown or'
power failure during the operation? How is it possible'that quantity of wastewater for Kagtela is
162



5 times greater than the quantity for Trogir? Is there a possibility for treatment of wastewater of
Kastela in the area of Kastela and can it be discharged into the sea from tiovo? Is the old part of
Trogir -included in the first phase of construction of the collecting system? Where will the
headquuters of the Agency that will manage the system be located?   -
Stipe Gujinovic protests against the construction of the wastewater treatment plant and outfall
in the Mavarscica Bay where the untreated wastewater of Kastela will be discharged. He asked
why can't the wastewater be treated at the place of its origin.
Ante Beljan. Will the construction of the collecting system endanger the area planned for
tourism west and east from Mavarscica Bay? Why weren't all local communities included in the
Project and Agency for solution of the problem of wastewater disposal?
After all the participants asked questions and expressed their opinion, the authors of the Study
commented and reviewed the discussion and answered the questions.
They haven't answered particular questions. Instead, comments and answers were made in
regard to particular themes.
Comments:
The wastewater treatment plant and outfall location in the area of Mavarscica
The proposed location for the wastewater treatment plant and submarine outfall in Mavars6ica
Bay and problem of possible pollution of sea water in the Mavarscica area drew the greatest
attention and raised a great number of questions.
The concern about the location was only expressed from inhabitants (permanent and owners of
weekend houses) of the Mavars6ica Bay.
Regardless of all comments and worries, the location of the wastewater treatment plant situated
in the bay behind Mavarscica village and 250 m (and possibly more than 300 m) from the
nearest hosing and 400 m from the sea is the most favourable location in accordance with the
information given in Report Chapter 1.
The fear expressed by inhabitants is understandable because they don't have the real conception
of the wastewater treatment plant and the outfall neither they had an opportunity to see how the
plant operates in practice. They believe that such treatment plant will be odorous and noisy and
it will endanger the quality of living in the surrounding area.
In order to eliminate their concerns it is necessary to inform them (organise additional meetings
on the spot) about the characteristics of the plant, its operation and measures that will be
undertaken in order to eliminate negative impacts.
It is proposed, if necessary, to inform the representatives of local population in practice about
similar treatment plants in the country and abroad.
It is necessary to undertake all measures proposed in the Report because they are sufficient to
eliminate all negative impacts.
The danger of the pollution of the sea water in the area of Mavarscica is very small because the
sea currents are parallel to the shore and there is a small possibility that discharged wastewater
will be brought to the shore.
163



Treatment level
Proposed conceptual design of treatment and disposal of wastewater guarantees, with high
probability, that there won't be unwanted detrimental effects on the marine ecosystem ifall -
proposed measures are undertaken (similar solutions in the area of Croatian Adriatic coast also
prove it). Even if there were unwanted negative impacts, the planned monitoring program would
detect them on time and measures for a higher level of treatment could be undertaken
immediately.
Problems of the common solution for Kaltela and Trogir
It is understandable that local population isn't in favour of puification of the wastewater
brought from  other areas. Meanwhile, ecological  and economical reasons justiiy the
construction of unique system with one treatment plant and one outfall.
Industrial wastewater
Industry has to be treated in accordance with proposed measures which means that industrial
wastewater has to be treated at the place of its origin in accordance with proposed criteria.
Other questions
Other questions (problem of mercury, radioactive slag etc.) haven't referred to Studies, but
appropriate comments were made.
Split
Public hearing organised at Society of Engineers and Technicians lasted from 18.10 -to 21.05.
Split/Solin sewerage system and belonging wastewater treatment plant located in Stupe and
submarine outfall located in Stobrec were discussed.
Public hearing started the same way as public hearing organised in Kastel Sucurac. Participants
asked questions and expressed their opinion.
Ognjen Bonacci, university professor. The hydrology of the bay hasn't been taken in
consideration during the Study preparation and nobody talks about it which is inadmissible.
Pollution is brought into the bay by surface and underground water and nobody knows its
quantity.
Marko Sparac. Mavarkica Bay is polluted with oil and grease after the sewerage ring of Split
city harbour was built because grit/grease removal wasn't installed as part of the treatment plant
He is also concerned for the future of Mavarscica Bay after the planned collecting system is
built Where are locations where nothing will be constructed so he can move there? He will use
all available measures in order to stop the planned construction in Mavarscica Bay.
Ljubo Juric. Proposed solution is perfect and he supports it completely. Grit/grease removal
channels are missing at the location of existing treatmnent plant on Katalinica Brig. - -
Arsen Ivanisevic He praised the authors for such detailed inforrnation and presentation of the
Study. He suggests that all available measures must be undertaken in order to protect Mavarscica
Bay. He proposed to change location of the treatment plant Mavascica.
Marin Maravic& What are the dimensions of Mavarscica treatment plant and how big is the
open water area?
164



Drago Matosic. The urban wastewater treatment plant has to be located out of the settlements.
Is it possible to treat wastewater of Kastela in the area of Kastela and to transport purified
wastewater to'tiovo?        -          - -
Ina gparac. Why can't Kastela Bay become as clean as it used to be?.
Comments:
Questions and remarks that referred to the location of wastewater treatment plant and outfall in
the area of Mavarscica were similar to those asked at the public hearing in Kastela and therefore
the answers and comments from authors were similar and won't be repeated.
There were no negative remarks that referred to Split/Solin sewerage system. Participants
expressed their praise of such good solution.
The remark that referred to hydrology is correct if total pollution of Kastela Bay were discussed.
It is not correct for the solution of the urban wastewater problem which is the subject of this
Study. It should be solved in accordance with the 'proposed measures for the protection of
Kagtela Bay (diffuse sources of pollution).

Methodology of Calculation
After a discharge from sbmarie outfall orifice, wastewatr is mixed with the
recipient water forming a polluted plume that is gradualy spreading though the recipient.
Since the concenations of some pollutions from the wastewater are several times smaller in
the recipient, mixing of wastewater and recipient water causes the dilution of these poilutions.
Basicaly there are two phases of the wastewater dilution in the recipient water.
First phase is the iniial dilution that follows immediately after the discharge of
wastewater from submnaine oufall orifices Movenent of plwne consisted of wastewater and
recipient water is under dominant influence of kinetic energy that wastewater had after the
discharge from the submarine outfall ofice because of exit velocity and the difference
between density of wastewater and rmcipient water. There are two causes of dilution. The first
is velocity gradient that exists plume jet and recipient as well as turbulence in that area; the
second is direct lateral flow of recipient water into the plume by means of horizontal recipient
streaL
Second phase or secondary dilution follows after the plume density becomes equal to
the recipient density so the movement is caused by movement of water masses (stream) of
recipient itself Dilution generated durmg this phase is the result of turbulences within the
recipient streamL
Methodology of Calculation of Initial Dilution
There are two basic methods that are used to determine the initial dilution. They are:
- parametric models
- models derived from basic conservation laws
In this study parametric models were used.
Parametric models are used to determne charactistics of initial dilution process by
dimensional anlyses of fommulas that are approved by experience as functions of one or
several number of constants or parameters. Values of constants are dependent on
hydrodynamic charaistics of plume consisted of wastewater and recipient water and they
are determined experimentally on physical models.
Parameters can be classified into three groups:
- parameters that characterize-the submarine outfall,
- parameters that characterize the recipient,
- parameters that are combination of the previous two.
When wastewater is discharged from point sources of pollution (outfall without
diffuser or with diffuser with great distance between orifices), the following parameters can
be classified into the frst group:
- wastewater velocity at the diffuser orifice v0,
- wastewater density po,
- vertical angle of discharge cp,
- volume flow Q = v.4,
- flow of mass quantity Mo = vQ.
For linear sources of pollution (discharge of wastewater through the diffuser with
small distance between orifices) the following parameters can be classified into the first group
of parameters that chacterize submarine outfall:-
- wastewater density po,
2



- vertical angle of discharge <p,
- diffuser length L,
- distance between diffuser orifices 1,
Qo
- volume flow q0 --
- flow of mass quantity m =q
The following paramneters are classified into second group of parameters that characterize the
recipient:
- density of the recipient water at the outfall pa,
- average velocity of sea currents v.,
- horizontal direction of sea currents (in regard to the diffuser axis) 0,
dp~
- vertical stratification of the recipient characterized with E= --   or with Brunt-
.4d
Vaisal-frequency N = (g     )
Uplift flows Jo andjo are classified into the third group of paramneters:
P. - PO
- =$Qo; go,=   pO  9
jo= gAqo
as well as several others undimensional parameters. For e.g. for linear sources of pollution
they are:
:1i =  ~lb=   * 1. =j213 F=v
while for point sources of pollution, parameters are the following:
IB =N314   , 1 = J11 s2  =V.3 s e=N
Basically, any characteristic of the initial dilution process can be expressed as function
of previous parameters.

Brooks model of the initial dilution : S, = 0.3$gc"3q-23H [1] is the most commonly
used in present engineering practice. It is used only for linear source of pollution in calm,
unstratified recipienL Since streams in the sea are permanent, and uniform vertical profile of
density only an exceptional phenornenon, this model doesn't give a real picture of initial
dilution in stratified recipients and recipients with pronounced horizontal streams.
The recent resech conducted by Roberts (1], 12], [3] and [4] will be used in this
study. The result of these researches are several parametric models for linear sources of
pollution in unstatified and linearly stratified media that can be used in practice.
For point sources of pollution results of researches conducted by Lee [51 will be used.
He critically analyzed previous models and offered few of his models that can be used in
practice.

For linear source of pollution and unstatified media with horizontal streams, and for
values F<O.I (stagnant rcipient) the initial dilution is not significantly influenced by velocity
field. Therefore the solution will be the same for any diffuser position (solution doesn't
depend on 0):
.= 027g"3q2'3H
Previous expression is similar to the one made by Brooks. The only difference is the value of
constant that is smaller in this expression since it includes decrease in dilution due to
generation of the surface layer of polluted plume.. It is hard to expect the generation of such
surface layer in the sea since streams are permanent phenomenon. That is the reason why it is
more appropriate to use Brooks expression, that gives some greater initial dilution, where
horizontal stream velocity is small (F<0.28).
For values F>0.1 (in this study for F>0.28) the initial dilution depends on angle 0,
and for streams that are perpendicular to diffuiser (0=900) there is an asymptotic solution:
S.q =058f
v.H
In unstratified media, that was previously observed, polluted plume is always upwelling to the
surface of the recipient.
If the media is linearly stratified, pollution plume is retained within the recipient and
the initial dilution depends on density gradient, that is maximum level of equilibrium of jet
For the outfal with diffuser in linear stratified media with horizontal streams that are
vertically uniform, assumption that the source of pollution is linear can be accepted if

4/A<0.2 and "lb<0.31. Under these conditions for values F<0.1, the influence of streams on
initial dilution isn't significant, and therefore:
*213 = 097
Jo, 
For values F>O.1 solution depends on F and 0. For e.g. for 0.1 <F<100 and for velocity field
tha is perpendicular to diffuser (8=900), solution is given in following expression:
*2/3 = 2.9F"5 - 0S2
Jo
For angles OW010, for engineering purposes, in previous expressions projection of
velocity vector to the axis of diffuser normal can be used.
Beside the level of initial dilution, in linear stratified media significant are also: the
height of minimum  level of dilution within the polluted  plume zm, that is maximum
upwelling of polluted plume ze and its thickness he, as well as the length of the area of initial
dilution x, and the width of the wastefield in the end of the process of initial dilution w,.. For
F=O values of parameters ze, Zm and he can be determined from following ratios:
2,26h,~2J
'=2.6;       IS =  .E   = 1.7
b         b          b
Between F=0 and F=Q0. values z,, z, and he are slowly increasing, to become approximately
constant till F=l. For angles 4S0<8<90" and Froude number values of l<F<100, maximum
upwelling of polluted plume, maximal concentration height, length of the area of initial
dilution xi, and width of the wastefield during the initial dilution process w can be detemiined
from following ratios:
f   112
Z.  2.5F-"6; ZJ = 1.5F-116 ; Xi = 8.5F"13; w = l +OJ 4A F-""l)
41             4           '4            'L           -6
If value is F>>l, bottom of polluted plume is situated approximately at the level of outfall
orifice and it can be assumed that h, is approximately equal to z,.. If maximum upwelling of
polluted plume is greater than depth z,>H, it is more appropriate to use formula for
unstratified media.
Previous results for linear stratified media are the result of research on hydraulic
models using the assumption of linear source of pollution, and for values of parameters that
are used for common submarne outfalls. Using this fact it can be concluded that results can
be used for all kinds of diffusers where distance between orifices or discharge velocity are not
too big.
Increasing the ditnce between outfall orifices (L4b>0.32) and increasing the
wastewater discharge velocity (increasing the initial flow of mass quantity or ratioilb>O.2),
influence of the direction of discharge of wastewater jet is also increasing and therefore the
assumption of linear source of pollution can not be used.
For calm recipient, boundary value for orifice distance where there is still some
mixing between adjacent plumes can be determined from ratio Mab. For values 14>1.92 it is
more appropriate to use results determined on model for diffuser with only one orifice. These
results can not be used for recipient with horizontal streams since there is mixing between
adjacent plumes even when the distance between the diffuser orifices is significant..

Point sourwcs of pollution
The following outfalls should be treated as point sources of pollution: submanine
outfalls where diffuser is situated on relatively small depths and the distance between the
orifces is big enough so there is no mixing between adjacent polluted plumes, as well as
smaller outfalls where diffuser is not required since satisfying dilution is achieved by
discharge from only one orifice.
If the recipient is unsatified, polluted plume is upwelling all the way to the recien
surface. For such recipient and the condition that polluted plume is under dominant influence
of uplift (xA,<<1), minimun level of dilution for horizontal direction of discharge of
wastewater can be determined from following ratios:
S. =0.31           H<5-
S. = 0.32 va.H   ; Hz:5jv
QO          V.-
For linear stratified recipient without stms and for horizontal discharge of polluted
plume that is under dominant influence of uplift, that is if WBad.6, minimum level of
dilution S,., phume thickness he and maximun upwelling z., can be determined following
expressions:
0.0 ;        4         =4.0  1.6
J11144T4
ff horizontal streams exist in staified recipient, for vertical upwelling of polluted plume
from point source of pollution that is under dominant influence of uplift force, values of S.,,
h. and z. can be determined from ratios:
1.=2-)    ;  _= 2.1i .             -
Methodology of calculataon ofsecondaiy dilution
Method that is most commonly used in engineering practice to calculate secondary
dilution of wastewater is modeling of hydrodynamics of sea masses using hydrodynamic
models. The flow filed, generated in that way, is used as input data for model of dispersion
and transformation of observed polution indicator. Results of initial dilution model
(concentration of observed indicator) are also used as input data for secondary dilution modeL
Hydrodynamics of sea masses is in this study determined assuming the most negative
forms of velocity field that are acceptable from the standpoint of bacteriological pollution.
For modeling of dispersion and transformation of pollution two models were used: Brooks
Model and CDR-2D Model that was produced at Civil Engineering Faculty in Split Forrner
was used for modeling of bacteriological pollution, BOD-5 and suspended solids, while the
letter was used for modeling of bacteriological pollution only since it was proved to be
effective.
Brooks Modl   --
Brooks Model is based on the assumption of uniform and constant discharge of
wastewater frm linear source of pollution of length L, installed perpendicular to the direction
of sea cunrnts v, (FIfgun 2.3-X). Streams are timespace constant, and have the direction of x

axis. Vertical diffusion D. and diffusion in direction of sea streams Ds are disregarded.
Results of initial dilution model are used as input data for Brooks Model tirough maximrnum
concentration of observed parameter within polluted plume c.,e
dx(D, oy)~ v   - K:c = o
where:
c - concentration of analyzed parameter,
K - coefficient of reaction,
v, - velocity of recipient stream,
Horizontal diffusion Dy depends on the width of wastefield L:
Dy = aL4'3
where values of coefficient a are between 0.0015 and 0.0449 cm2'3/s. The value of 0.01 is
most commonly used in practice.
According to Brooks, the value of maxmumn concentration of observed parameter at
the x distance fron a diffuser is given by following expression:
-K;73/212DY
C.  c,e " erf                      vsL
where:
24 
erf(a)=    le 2d*
The width of wastefield L. at the distance x can be determined fiom ratios:
Lx _(1+2i)
L   J3L)
CDR-2D Model
CDR 2D Model is used to calculate secondary dilution for unstrtfied recipient, when
polluted plume is discharged all the way to the surface of a recipient. Minimum level of
dilution under these conditions will be found at recipient surface. Polluted plume is then
spreading through recipient under the influence of surface streams. Only the surface layer of
the recipient will be modeled (assumring that vertical diffusion can be disregarded because
calculation is on safe side), and therefore 2-D model will be used. Since the nature of
phenomenon allows it (analyzed area is relatively small and pollution is traveling only few
hours before it reaches the shore), this problem can be regarded as stationary.

Selected weak formulation allows certain flexibility in formulation of constraint
boundary conditions. Formulation allows omting of boundary conditions through open
boundaries where exists the flow of parameter mass due to streams within recipient. It is
assumed there is no diffusion of mass through these boundaries, which means that only
convective component exists thrgh these boundaries. Possible enor due to this assunption
is several times smaller that possible error due to arbitrary defined constraint boundary
conditions. In order to secure unifonimty of solution, it is enough to defme constramnt
condition in only one of the nodes.
SDGM (space discontinuous Galerkmn method) 16] is used to fmd the solution in form
of linear cornbination of localized basic functions:
c= c,4p, ,;r = 1,2,...,n
where qp,is localized basic function for node r of finite elements net, and n is total nunber of

In previous expressions Ax and Ay are characteristic lengths of elements in x andy directions.
Test functions will retain the form of standard Galjerlin method in regard to boundary

The following system of linear equations is formed:

Uniformnity of solutions is secured with constraint boundary conditions. If functions are
linear, the last member of matrix Ms.r is canceled. Matrices and vectors of upper (global)
system are built of finite elements matrices and vectors. Frontal procedure is used to arrange

Calculation of submarine outfall "Stobreo.
Input data and analyzed alternatives
Maximum discharge of wastewater at this subem    outfall is 880 쥺 Wastewater
will be mchanically purified prior to discharge. It is assumed that the concentration of
coliform bacteia m wastewater after mechanical purification will be 8.16f APN/lXinI.
Wastewater density is around 1000(gAri.
Selected aLtemative of submanne outfall is situated around 16W0 m from the shore,
diffuser length is 400n7, and depth of discharge is around 37m.
From the results of oceanographic research of Bral and Split Channel sea water
conducted in September of 1990. and April of 1991. for purposes of pollution modeling, the
following facts can be observed:
- at the location in front of Stobrec there is distinct vertical stratification of sea
density, it can be accepted that the average sea density is around 1028 k&i&, a
thermocline is present at depth of around 10 m.
- time of bacterial decay T0 in surface layers is between 3 and 5 hours, and it is
gradually inmcreasing with the depth,
- based on results of measuring of sea curents in Brac and Split Channel in front of
Stobred (measurng station is situated 2-3 km south from the outfall location),
stream velocities m the surface layer were chosen that are, m regard to their
frequency and duration, acceptable for calculation of propagation of bacterial
pollution. Critical stream directions are toward the shore and therefore only these
values will be given:
direction N v,=13.9 aDh
direction NE v ll=.8 ank,
direction NW v,=2O.2 ans
direction E v,=11.6cmA/s
Minimum velocities are around 1.5 cm/s.
Initial dilution will be determined on parametric models and results will be used as
input data for secondary dilution model.
According to already existng uDl)ctive concerning classification of water and
coastal sea water", open sea of Brac and Split Channel is classified as ElT category, while the
coastal sea belt of 300m width is classified as if. caWoty, That means that submarine outfall
must have such characterstics to secure that bacterial concentration m the outfall area is
lower than maximum allowable for sea water of IZT categoty (20000 MPN/IOOmlhn). Diffuser
must be installed on such distance from the shore to secure that bacterial concentaion within
polluted plume that would reach the coastal area is less than maximum allowable for sea
water of H. category(5OMPN/IOml).
Two characteristic altematives were analyzed:
- first alternative examined the winter period, analyses were conducted assuming
there was no vertical stratification of density withm the recipient,
- second alternative analyzed the summer period when vertical stratification is
distinct assuming that recipient is unstratified under the thermocline (thennocline is
present at depth of around 10 m).
10



For calculation of initial dilution bottom strearn velocities were used, while for
calculation of secondary dilution surface velocities were used. Values of bottom velocities
-were used as half of surface ones.
Yor first alternative calculation was conducted for all four previously mentioned
critical directions of surface strearns toward the shore:
- direction N, surface velocity 13.9 cmls, bottom velocity 7 cm/s,
- direction NE, surface velocity 11.8 cm/s, bottom velocity 5.9 cm/s,
- direction NW, surface velocity 20.2 cmnls, bottom velocity 10.1 cm/s,;
- direction E, surface velocity 1l.6 cn/s, bottom velocity 5.8 cmls
For these four alternatives Brooks Model and CDR-2D Model were used to calculate
secondary dilution..
Area covered with CDR-2D Model (figure with discretisation model is given in
Appendices) was the surface layer of sea water around the outfall, and its part toward the
shore that was appropriate for deternination of the concentration of coliform bacteria at the
entrance to coastal sea area. Thus, this model wasn't analyzing only the coastal sea belt where
sea water was classified as II category (200m away frorn the shore), but the area out of that
zone. Modeled area was discreted with the net consisted of 720finite elernents. Nine-nodal 2-
D elements were selected, therefore the net consisted of 2993 nodes. In order to decrease the
osciDlations of the solutions where differences in concentrations are the greatest, the fuiite
elernent net was made more dense at the outfall location.
Since this model was not requiring it, boundary conditions were not defined on
boundaries that were in contact with discarded part of the continuum, it was assumed that
there was no diffusion of mass through these boundaries. Model required solution values to
be defined in only one of the nodes of the net which was fulfilled in the model by assigning
the results of initial dilution.
Results of initial dilution were assigned as known values at the diffuser location.
These values were assigned to seven nodes situated on that location. In that way, the impact
of wastefield width on secondary dilution, and impact of diffuser position in regard to wind
direction were included in a model to a certain degree
Coefficient of diffusion was selected according to Brooks ModeL For diffuser of 400
m its value is: DX = D, = Im2/s.
Assumed time for 90% of bacterial decay on the surface is T9035hours.
During the summer polluted plume will be retained and spread under the thermocline
layer, and there would be no possibility of its passing above that layer. Due to that reason
calculation of initial dilution using paramnetic models for second altenative was conducted
using the assumption that sea depth was reduced for thermocline height.
Second alternative analyzed three critical directions of streams toward the shore.
Bottom velocities were used to determine initial and secondary dilution:
- direction N, bottom velocity 9 cn/s,
- direction NE, bottom velocity 8 cn1s,
- direction NW, bottom velocity 10 cm/s.
As additional altemative, that was acceptable for outfall location, calm recipient with
minimum velocity in the area of plume upwelling of 1.S cns was also analyzed For this
alternative only the Brooks Model was used to calculate secondary dilution.
Assumed time for 90% of bacterial decay under the thermocline is Tw,=5hours.

1  Results
;-dThe m ling results are presented on figures and tables that are given in Appendices.
Results of CDR-2D Model are presented as isolines. Assigned line presents the bactad
of SOOA     (JWC&n sice it is maximum allowable concentration (according to
existing legislature) in fte coastal sea area (coastal sea belt of 2W0m width). Selected step for
drawig of isolines is 500AMPN/I7anL Some winding of isolines and appearance of isolines
of 0 concentrations are the result of smaller numerical oscillations.
Results of initial dtion modeling show that bacta] concentration after the process
of inital dilution has ended, for the most critical alternative of stagnat rocipient, are around
20000 APN/1Onl, which is maximum allowable concentration for sea water of ilL
categmy. For other altematives these values are below legally required. Thus, diffuser fulfills
legal bacterial criteria at the outfall location. The same can be concluded for suspended
solids. Their concentration are significantly below legally required of 60mng/i for sea water of
lTlctegoiy.
Results of secondary dilution modeling using both models show that for neither
altemative bacteral conentration in the coastal sea area hasn't exceeded 509 APN10X9nl,
which is maximum allowable concentration for the sea water of ff categary. Concentrations
of suspended solids are significantly lower than required 20 mg/I for the sea water. of II
category That implies that chosen distanmc of diffuser from the shore is acceptable in regard
to the preservation of coastal sea area from pollution.

Calculation of submarine outfall -tiovor
Input data and analyzed alternatives
Maximum discharge of wastewater is 650 Us- It is assumed that the concentration of
coliform bacteria in wastewater will be JdMAPPN/anl. Wastewater density is around 1000
1g4W.
Selected altemative of submarne outfall is situated around 2050 m from the shore
(measured from the spot where submarne outfall enters the sea), diffuser length is 400 m,
and depth of discharge is around 52 m.
From the results of oceanographic research of Brac and Split Channel conducted in
September of 1990. and April of 1991., the following facts can be observed:
- at the outfall location there is a distinct vertical stratification of sea density, and it
can be accepted that the average sea density is around 1028 kg/r, a thermocline is
present at depth of around 12 m.
- time of coliform bacterial decay T,v in surface layers is between 3 and 3 hours, and
it is gradually increasing with the depth,
- based on results of measuring of sea cunrents in Bral and Split Charmel at the
outfall location, stream velocities in the surface layer were chosen that are, in
regard to their frequency and duration, acceptable for calculation of propagation of
bacterial pollution. They are:
direction N v,=15na"
direction NE v,=l6a7/s,
direction NW va=16mA/,
Minimum velocities are around 1.5 cm/s.
Initial dilution will be determined on parametric models and results will be used as
input data for secondary dilution modeL
Two characteristic altematives were analyzed:
- first alternative examined the winter period, analyses were conducted assuming
there was no vertical stratification of density within the recipient,
- second alternative analyzed the summer period. when vertical stratification is
distinct and thermocline is present at depth of around 12 m, assuming that recipient
is verticaly unstratified under the thermocline
For calculation of initial dilution bottom stream velocities were used, while for
calculation of secondary dilution surface velocities were used. Values of bottom velocities
were used as half of surface ones.
For first alternative calculation was conducted for three previously mentioned critical
directions of surface streams toward the shore:
- direction N, surface velocity 15 cm/s, bottom velocity 7.5 cm/s,
- direction NE, surface velocity 16 cm/s, bottom velocity 8 cm/s,
- direction NW, surface velocity 15 cmls, bottom velocity 8 cwu/s.
For these altematives Brooks Model and CDR-2D Model were used to calculate secondary
dilution..
Area covered with CDR-2D Model (figure with discretisation model is given in
Appendices) was the surface layer of sea water around the outfall, and its part toward the
shore that was appropriate for detennination of the concentration of coliforrn bacteria at the
entrance to coastal sea area. Modeled area was discreted with the net consisted of 720 finite
13



elements. Nine-nodal 2-D elements were selected, therefore the net consisted of 2993 nodes.
The finite elements net was made more dense at the outfall location.
Boundary conditions were derned similary as far the previous outfalL -
Results of initial diution were assigned as known values at the diffuser location.
These values were assigned to seven nodes situated on that location.- :
Coefficient of diffusion was selected according to Brooks Model. For diffuser of 4W
m its value is: DS  D = 1m2/s.
Assumed time for 90% of bacterial decay on the surface is T.w=3.5hours.
During the summer polluted plume will be retained and spread under the thermocline
layer, and there is no possibility of its passing above that layer. Due to that reason calculation
of initial dilution using parametric models for altemative with thermocline was conducted
using the assumption that sea depth was reduced for thenrocline height, and recipient was
unstratified.
Three critical stream directions toward the shore were analyzed for second
alternative.. Bottom velocities were used to calculate initial and secondary dilution:
- direction N, bottom velocity 9.5 cm/s,
- direction NE, bottom velocity 10 cm/s,
- direction NW, bottom velocity 10 cmls,
As additional alternative, a calm recipient with muinimum velocity in the area of plume
upwelling of 1.5 cmls was also analyzed. Assumed time for 90% of bacterial decay under the
thermocline is T,w=6hours.
Results
The modeling results are presented in Appendices. Results of CDR-2D Model are
presented as isolines the same way as it was done for previous outfall.
Results of initial dilution modeling show that bacteral concetation after the process
of initial dilution has ended, for neither alternative has not exceeded maximunm allowable
concentration for sea water of lZZ categy. The same is valid for suspended solids. Their
concentration are significantly below legally required ones.
Results of secondary dilution modeling using both models show that for neither
alternative bacterial concentration in the coastal sea area hasn't exceeded maximum allowable
concentration for the sea water of 11 categmry The same can be concluded for suspended
solids. That implies that chosen distance of diffuser from the shore is acceptable in regard to
the preservation of coastal sea area fron pollution.
