KINGDOM OF THAILAND
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:          Kingdom of Thailand.
Amount:            US$400 million
Terms:             Single Currency Loan (SCL) in US Dollars, with a 15-year maturity, including a 3-
year grace period, at the Bank's standard fixed US Dollar SCL interest rate.
Description:       The proposed loan (Public Sector Reform Loan or PSRL) of US$400 million is a
programmatic structural adjustment loan (PSAL) that would support Thailand's
Public Sector Reform Program (the Program). It is envisaged that over the three-year
period of Thailand's Program, there could be up to three single-tranche PSALs to
support its implementation.
Thailand's Program would improve public sector management through:
*  Improved performance-based resource management. Creating incentives for
budget and civil service agencies to focus on outcomes-by improving
performance and effectiveness in the management of financial and human
resources;
* Better service delivery. Restructuring the way central government delivers
services-by improving service delivery in selected line ministries through
outsourcing, restructuring or decentralizing government activities and enhancing
public sector responsiveness to communities;
* Greater accountability and transparency. Restoring confidence in government
by improving transparency in budgeting, refocusing the civil service toward
client service, and establishing effective mechanisms to promote accountability
and transparency.
Thailand intends to achieve these objectives by implementing specific action plans in
the five areas of (i) expenditure management, (ii) human resources management, (iii)
revenue management, (iv) decentralization, and (v) cross-government accountability
and transparency.
Benefits:          To contribute to Thailand's incipient economic recovery and an eventual return to
sustainable high growth, the public sector must improve its efficiency and become
more effective in delivering results. Better public services are central to medium-
term competitiveness and sustained productivity increases of workers; better
expenditure management is necessary to raise the productivity of public investment;
and improving transparency can help citizens hold their leaders and public servants
more accountable for the quality of services their taxes are buying.
Thailand's Program establishes a framework for Thailand's difficult path toward
restructuring government operations. Over the short term, the consultations and
coordination embedded in the formulation of the details of Thailand's Program
provide an effective platform to harness broad-based support for public sector reform
within civil society and the Government itself. Over the long term, the
implementation of Thailand's Program will lead to the improvement of public sector
governance to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and transparency of
public resource management and service delivery.



Risks:              Thailand's Program is not without risks. First, although civil society demand for
public sector reform is strong, it is not necessarily well-articulated. However, civil
society organizations are active in monitoring and advising the public sector. To give
additional voice to this force, civil society is being actively involved in the reform
program through public announcements, an awareness campaign, and oversight from
distinguished citizens, community-based organizations and think tanks.
Second, implementation of Thailand's Program could suffer if coordination among
agencies is insufficient. Nonetheless, the publication of the Cabinet paper, the Public
Sector Management Reform Plan, in May of this year and the appointment of a
senior team overseeing reforms demonstrate the Government's resolve to act
decisively in formulating a coordinated program.
Third, the political commitment to reform could weaken due to political resistance to
institutional reform or change from the currently reform-minded government to a less
reform-oriented administration. This risk to Thailand's Program is mitigated by the
fact that the Cabinet, high-ranking civil servants in the line agencies, and civil society
share the key institutional objectives of the Program.
The Bank will help monitor the progress of Thailand's Program against specific
benchmarks.
Poverty Category:   NA
Estimated           The loan would be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness.

Box 1: The New Constitution
Designed to end the inertia that had virtually paralyzed recent govermments, the new Constitution,
approved by Parliament in October 1997, introduces broad reforms to combat corruption and electoral fraud,
empower civil society, and safeguard individual liberties. In addition, the Constitution mandates broad changes
in public expenditure management, including how finances are managed, how and what services are delivered,
and how they are reported to the general public. It requires the Auditor General to report his findings to the
Parliament. The Constitution mandates the establishment of key institutions to provide grievance mechanisms
including the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Counter Corruption Commission. It calls for universal
access to education through grade 12 and defnes a strong role for the private sector in delivering educational
services. The Constitution also envisages the decentralization of government activities by increasing the share
of local government expenditures, assigning more revenue sources to local governments, and revising the system
of intergovernmental transfers to provide grants in a more transparent and predictable way.

LETTER OFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY
September 24, 1999
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
1818 H St. NW
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
Subject: Proposed Public Sector Reform Loan
Letter of Development Policy
Thailand is gradually emerging from the economic crisis that began two years ago. The crisis
highlighted underlying structural problems and has left a difficult legacy ofsignificant corporate non-
performing loans, unemployment and rising public debt. Our Government has successfully restored
investor confidence and begun to rebuild the financial sector. Since the beginning of the crisis, our
efforts have focused on addressing corporate debt, restoring growth, reviving investment and
domestic demand, and shielding the poor. As economic recovery is beginning to take hold, we are
now aiming to sustain this growth by turning towards medium-term structural reform. Building a
more efficient public sector is a key pillar of Thailand's strategy to modernize and strengthen Thai
institutions to meet both the mandates of our new Constitution and the development challenges of
globalization.
THE NEED FOR REFORM AND PAST REFORM EFFORTS
The economic crisis highlighted the need for broad-based public sector reforms in Thailand in
several respects. First, Thailand's public finances have come under serious pressure as a result of
large deficits and growing public-sector debt. After a decade of surpluses, the combination of
recession-induced lower revenues, and rising expenditures to meet the social needs of the crisis and
the public costs of restructuring the financial system have resulted in large deficits and substantially
increased public debt.
Second, Thailand's reform agenda has received renewed impetus with the passage of the new
Constitution in 1997. The Constitution provides for increased citizen participation, enhanced
transparency and decentralization - tools that enhance voice and improve public sector governance.
The Constitution's main themes are to: promote and protect citizens' rights and human integrity,
promote participatory democracy, improve political structures, decentralize authority to local bodies,
redesign the work process of government agencies to be responsive to citizens' need, and abolish
cumbersome regulations that are a burden to efficient markets.



Third, the Thai people are demanding more accessible, timely and higher quality government
services. Taxpayer pressure for more efficient management of the Government's financial resources
is accompanied by public demand for a leaner and more effective civil service. Improvements in
transparency and accountability are necessary to strengthen the confidence of Thai people in public
administration.
The Cabinet has issued several resolutions to improve the performance of the public sector.
These include:
*  The Master Plan of Public Sector Reform B.E. 2540 - 2544.
*  Civil Service Adjustment Measure during the Crisis (30 December 1997) including actions to
adjust work processes, improve public personnel quality, reduce corruption, promote local
decentralization, define the mission of government agencies, among others.
*  Measures on Personnel Expenditure Control (3 February 1998).
*  Measures on Manpower Adjustment (28 April 1998).
*  Measures on Manpower Adjustment of Permanent Employees (26 May 1998), to abolish
vacant positions of permanent employees.
*  Measures on Personnel Expenditure Control (30 June 1998) to decrease budgeted salary
increase from 6 to 5 percent.
*  Public Sector Mission Regrouping (28 July1998) to define missions that should be carried out
by government agencies, state-owned enterprises, the private sector, public organizations,
local bodies, and community organizations.
Thailand's public sector reform is already well underway. The efforts so far include (i)
restructuring plans for the Ministry of Commerce; (ii) re-engineered processes in 5 pilot departments
that emphasize results-based management; (iii) implementation of the Master Plan for State-Owned
Enterprise Reforn; and (iv) passage of important legislation, including the Official Information Act.
Because the crisis presented an opportunity to accelerate the reforms underway, in May 1999,
the Government issued a more proactive and comprehensive Public Sector Management Reform Plan.
This Plan recognizes that fundamental public sector reform must address the public sector's
organization, structure, processes, and management culture in order to:
* Provide high-quality services to citizens
* Develop effective processes and personnel comparable to international standards
* Use resources effectively
* Create a public sector that is visionary, and responsive both to citizen needs and the changing
international and domestic environments
* Build a public administration that is trusted by the people.
The ultimate goal of public sector reform is to enhance the quality of life of Thai people, to
promote a stable and peaceful society, and to integrate the country into the global community.



VISION OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Our Government has responded to these pressures by launching an ambitious program to
reform the public sector. Its main components include a more performance-oriented budget system, a
flexible and effective civil service, and greater transparency. The reform efforts involve central
government agencies and line ministries such as education and health which have embarked upon
substantial reforms to deliver better services in their sectors.
The proposed loan builds on this work and provides a coherent, medium-term framework for
reforming the public sector institutions around three objectives:
*  Better management of financial and human resources. Truly reforming the effectiveness of
Government requires reorienting public management toward performance and outcomes. The key
is to restructure incentives and processes to improve resource management at the central-agency
level. Enhancing effectiveness will require broad-based institutional changes to manage
expenditure priorities over the medium-term and within an outcome-oriented framework, and to
refocus human resource management on performance rather than patronage. Enhanced revenue
performance is increasingly important as growing concerns over fiscal sustainability require
expansions in the tax base and improved tax compliance through improvements in tax
administration.
-  Improved service delivery. The Government must improve public services to contribute to
restoring economic growth and establishing a more equitable distribution of services. This
involves restructuring the way central government delivers services by being more responsive to
communities and enhancing the access, timeliness and quality of services provided by line
ministries. Improving public services will require developing strategic plans to focus ministerial
responsibilities, re-engineering institutions and processes to promote efficiency, devolving
responsibility for service delivery closer to customers, outsourcing and decentralizing
responsibilities to local administrations.
-  Greater accountability and transparency to help improve confidence in public administration
requires institutional changes that enhance citizen participation and provide opportunities for
voice, improve information disclosure, establish accountability for authorities, reduce the scope of
discretionary bureaucratic authority, and improve the civil service.
PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM MEASURES
Based on Thailand's Public Sector Management Reform Plan of May 24, 1999, the
Constitution of 1997 and our priorities for economic management, we are implementing a
comprehensive program  of institutional reforms.  These include the areas of (i) expenditure
management, (ii) human resource management, (iii) revenue management, (iv) decentralization, and
(v) cross-government accountability. We believe that only by ensuring greater efficiency and
program effectiveness can Thailand convert its recent recovery into the rapid and sustained growth it
has known in the past. Better public services, from education to infrastructure, are keys to medium-
term competitiveness, sustained productivity, and increased income. Better management of financial
and human resources is essential to raise the productivity of public investment and other expenditures
and to improve medium-term planning and management. Improving transparency will help citizens
hold their leaders and public servants more accountable for the quality of services their taxes are
buying.



The Public Sector Reform Committee (PSRC), supported by a secretariat has been given
responsibility for managing the reform program and has established interagency subcommittees with
representatives from counterpart reform units in the key central agencies and participating line
ministries. Internal working groups have been formed to prepare strategic plans for the Bureau of the
Budget, the Ministry of Finance, the NESDB, and the Office of the Civil Service Commission
redefining their respective roles in a modernized public sector.
EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT
The recent economic crisis has placed Thailand's budget system under stress and highlighted a
number of structural weaknesses in expenditure management. The Government will focus on budget
reform to create performnance incentives for prioritizing and targeting government expenditures.
Thai budget processes are strongly centralized by the standards of well performing countries.
This centralization ensures effective achievement of overall fiscal targets. However, the achievement
of aggregate fiscal control has been accompanied by inflexibilities and distortions which a highly
centralized approach to budget allocations imposes on sector ministries. We want to provide more
incentives for sector ministries to use the budget process as an essential management tool wherein
policy solutions to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of their programs are actively
considered.
The objective of expenditure management reforn for Thailand is to delegate the necessary
budgetary authority to sector ministries and to hold them accountable for performance. The
performance of sector ministries will be measured by their ability to reflect Cabinet priorities in their
strategic plans and to deliver promised results. The task of the central agencies -- particularly of the
Bureau of the Budget -- is to define a new framework of flexibility and accountability for sector
ministries and then to enable sector ministries to implement the framework.
This framework provides the foundation for a new budget formulation process that focuses
not on inputs but on outcomes and outputs. The reforms will begin by identifying strategic priorities
across the Government; key ministries, departments and public organizations will be required to
produce strategic plans showing their objectives and desired outcomes, outputs, performance
standards, management plans and resource requirements.  These plans will be published and
disseminated widely to the public. Central agencies will review these strategic plans as part of the
budget formulation process with an emphasis on whether they both reflect government-wide priorities
and are well prepared. After this review, resource agreements will be formed between the central
agencies and line ministries where, for a given level of resource allocation and flexibility, the
expected performance of a line ministry will be clearly defined and agreed.
Poverty alleviation is one of Thailand's strategic goals that will be reflected in the strategic
plans of line ministries. However, expenditures and subsidies to reduce poverty are often ineffective
due to poor targeting and limited evaluation. As a cross-cutting policy objective, the central agencies
will improve their capabilities to monitor and review the distributional incidence of sector programs
and of targeting subsides.
To meet the demands of a globalized economy, our expenditure management reforms aim to
achieve the following objectives:
* Implementing performance budgeting by formulating strategic plans, forming resource
agreements with performance targets in sector ministries, and incorporating budget evaluation-
feedback into the budget cycle.



*  Improving the planning capability of sector ministries through functional reviews of program
areas, corporate plans and performance-based budgeting.
*  Enhancing line ministry performance through resource agreements and monitoring with increased
flexibility granted by the Bureau of the Budget.
*  Routinely monitoring the distributional incidence of fiscal policy through multi-purpose
household surveys, and surveys of unit costs, prices and subsidies.
*  Improving the targeting of expenditures and progressivity of subsidies by routinely using
distributional criteria in making ex ante expenditure decisions.
* Strengthening key government agencies in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of service
delivery.
*  Establishing a medium-term macro-fiscal plan that would influence annual budgets.
* Adopting international standards for fiscal transparency.
* Preparing complete government financial statements (including contingent liabilities).
Over the next three years, we expect to achieve:
*  Greater performance focus in sector ministries accompanied  by new  flexibility  and
accountabilities.
*  A results-oriented management framework that produces more effective and efficient programs.
.  Improved transparency of fiscal, financial and performance information at all levels of
government.
To reach these objectives, Thailand has completed the first stage of reforms in this area,
including: (i) signing Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) between BoB and selected pilot
departments in the health and education sectors; (ii) completing the Government's review of
expenditure effectiveness; and (iii) submitting the Organic Law on State Audit to Parliament.
HIUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
The performance of the public administration is a key ingredient of Thailand's economic
development. The economic crisis has highlighted the need to strengthen civil service capacity to
resume economic growth. To improve the implementation of government programs, we are striving
to create a service-oriented, cost-effective civil service driven by results rather than entitlements. This
will require greater cooperation among agencies and ministries and greater confidence in the quality
and probity of civil service management.
Delivering better services in a cost effective and equitable way is a key objective of our
reform program. This will require enhancing the access, timeliness and quality of public services
through outsourcing, restructuring or decentralizing activities and being more responsive to clients.
Administrative renewal involves modernizing the role, organization, and processes of key line
ministries to enhance their performance in delivering services. More efficient use of public resources
requires streamlining procedures, eliminating duplicative structures, devolving to local
administrations or outsourcing activities inappropriate for government involvement to the private
sector.



Key areas for our human resource management reforms include:
*  Guiding the process of functional reviews to identify opportunities for restructuring, re-
engineering, outsourcing and decentralizing public-sector functions, processes and staff for
effective policy making and service delivery.
*  Aligning organizational development and restructuring programs for government ministries and
departments with their service objectives.
*  Devolving non-core functions to local administrations, contracting to the private sector or to
Autonomous Public Organizations.
*  Improving efficiency of service delivery in core areas of ministry activity.
*  Strengthening human resources and structure staffing levels to meet the ministry's objectives.
*  "Rightsizing" the civil service by adjusting staffing levels to new public sector requirements,
involving an expected reduction of 10 percent of the total number of government officials by
2002.
*  Introducing performance-based human resource management systems for the civil service (e.g.,
individual job description and classification systems, greater flexibility in employment system,
performance appraisal and remuneration, career development and advancement, and disciplinary
and complaint systems).
* Strengthening the caliber of cross-government senior government staff (through development of a
Senior Executive Service cadre groomed for civil service leadership posts).
Over the next three years, we expect to achieve:
3  Completed functional reviews in the social and economic ministries.
  Restructured and reengineered (selected) ministries in light of the functional reviews.
*  Devolution of identified services to local administrations or the private sector.
*  Implementation of a framework for performance-based human resource management that ensures
effective linkages among planning, recruitment and selection, remuneration, performance
management and human resource development.
*  Rightsized public administration through outsourcing, retrenchment, changing the skill mix, or
career counseling and retraining.
*  A strengthened position classification system.
*  A functioning Senior Executive Service.
* An effective governance framework for Autonomous Public Organizations.
To reach these objectives, Thailand has completed the first stage of reforms in this area,
including (i) completing the Functional Review of the Ministry of Commerce; and (ii) adopting the
Law on Autonomous Public Organizations.



REVENUE MANAGEMENT
Deficiencies in Thailand's tax administration that were little noticed during periods of rapid
economic growth are now obvious and of sufficient magnitude to challenge future fiscal
sustainability. In 1997 and 1998, tax collections as a percentage of GDP declined beyond what could
be explained by the recession (by 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent respectively), and tax arrears doubled
(to Bt 79.1 billion, or more than 1.5 percent of GDP.) Thailand plans to recover these lost revenues,
and mobilize additional revenues to compensate for lower trade tariffs as part of the Government's
program for trade liberalization, pay for losses in the financial system, and meet the budgetary
demands for increased expenditures for the poor.
The task of tax administration is complex, involving meeting difficult and diverse targets and
objectives, such as processing declarations and payments, collecting debts, combating tax evasion and
providing advice and assistance to taxpayers. The complexity of the work, and the size (about 18,000
people) and geographical spread (roughly 1,000 offices) of the organization require clear
organizational objectives and strategies, defined in a multi-year strategic plan with clearly defined
performance indicators.
Improved tax collections require more modem approaches to tax administration. Audit
performance must be improved and the Revenue Department's computer system must support the
operational aspects of tax administration.
The objectives of our proposed tax administration reforms are to: (i) ensure adequate and
sustainable revenue; (ii) improve revenue collection, widen the tax base, and achieve a more equitable
distribution of the tax burden; and, (iii) strengthen the managerial capacity of the Revenue
Department to perform its functions efficiently and effectively on a sustainable and transparent basis..
We are planning to undertake the following reforms to achieve these objectives:
* Strengthening tax collection enforcement to rein in the growth in tax arrears.
* Improving taxpayer compliance by coordinating audit with the collection of delinquent accounts
and developing and implementing a comprehensive audit strategy.
-  Improving overall revenue management by developing strategic plans, establishing information
technology priorities and developing new applications.
Over the next three years, the expected results of our reform efforts include:
* Improved revenue collections that achieve or surpass historical tax revenue to GDP ratios.
* Reduced collectible debt to a manageable level (i.e., about 5 percent of total annual tax
collections).
* Increased audit revenue to 2.5 percent of total tax collections.
* Establishing a new Large Business Tax Administration Office to manage at least 50 percent of
total revenue collections.
* Developing and implementing a fully functional and integrated IT system, which is networked to
Revenue Department offices.
To reach these objectives, Thailand has completed the first stage of reforms in this area,
including establishing a Large Business Tax Administration Office expected to handle at least the 500
largest taxpayers.



DECENTRALIZATION
Thailand is a highly centralized country with limited local autonomy in terms of functions,
area, staffing, funding and decision making. The central government spends 93 percent of total
general expenditures and collects 95 percent of general tax revenues; only 25 percent of municipal
revenues are locally collected and retained, and the central government appoints chief local officials,
deternines local salaries and approves local budgets.
Reducing the role of the central government and moving toward a decentralized fiscal system
will require significant changes in existing institutions, processes and culture. At the same time,
decentralization reforms can provide synergies in overall public sector reform. Functional reviews of
line ministries will identify opportunities for privatization and decentralization of service delivery.
The Ministries of Public Health and Education are deconcentrating service delivery to local
entitities (i.e., Local Education Authorities and Provincial Hospitals), that in the future may be
transferred to local administrations. Changes in the intergovernmental transfer system that improve
the targeting of subsidies to the poor enhance the delivery of services. And effective decentralization
is impossible without broader reforms in financial and human resource management.
Thailand has identified decentralization as a policy priority in Thailand's 8th National
Economic and Social Development Plan. The Constitution features decentralization prominently,
specifying principles of local autonomy and elected local representatives, among other aspects of local
governance.  Objectives envisioned in the Constitution include increasing the share of local
administrations expenditures, assigning more revenue sources to local administrations, revising the
system of intergovernmental transfers to provide grants in a more transparent and predictable way,
and promoting mechanisms for local accountability.
Our fiscal decentralization reforms will focus on the following priorities:
*  Establishing an independent authority (the Nati6nal Decentralization Committee) to monitor the
status of decentralization reforms and promote cooperation among various ministries and
agencies.
*  Clearly assigning expenditure functions among levels of government and devolving functions to
local administrations.
*  Allocating adequate local revenues (which includes increasing revenue from property tax in a
phased manner and strengthening the Central Valuation Authority) and enhancing local tax
collections.
* Improving the equalization impact of intergovernmental grants by achieving a better balance
between specific grants and general-purpose grants and improving the targeting and equalization.
*  Developing mechanisms for local accountability.
*  Monitoring the status of decentralization and local public finances by developing local finance
benchmarks and publishing regular reports on local finance.
Over the next three years, we expect to promote self reliant local administrations by:
* Establishing the legislative framework in support of decentralization.



* Clarifying the assignment of expenditure functions among levels of government and successfully
devolving responsibility for the three pilot ministries.
* Assigning more revenue sources (e.g., local property taxes) to local administrations.
* Revising the system of intergovernmental transfers to provide grants in a more transparent and
predictable way.
* Promoting local accountability.
* Publishing regular reports on local public finances.
To reach these objectives, we have completed the first stage of reforms in this area, including
submitting legislation to Parliament to establish the National Decentralization Committee (NDC) as
an independent entity to support and monitor decentralization.
STRENGTHENING CROSS-GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY
Public accountability and transparency are key elements of our reform strategy to ensure that
government institutions, and the civil servants within them, are responsive to public needs, efficient in
the use of public funds, and accountable to the public for their actions. Greater transparency and
accountability in managing the affairs of government and public resources are crucial to strengthen
citizens' trust in public administration. Supported by the Constitution, our public sector reform will
create the institutions responsible for ensuring public accountability and demonstrate the
Government's commitment to fighting corruption.
To increase accountability and transparency across government, key objectives include:
* Increasing institutional accountability by strengthening formal institutional structures.
* Improving access to, and use of, public informnation by individual citizens and by civil society,
including improved responsiveness by the Government in providing this access.
* Increasing probity among civil servants.
* Involving civil society in improving transparency.
Over the next three years, key results that we expect to achieve include:
* Establishing a National Counter Corruption Commission to create and enforce standards for
integrity and transparency in Government, investigate allegations of corruption, and report
annually to the public.
* Establishing an Ombudsman to address citizens' grievances and other issues of public concern.
* Creating Administrative Courts that will provide citizens a judicial forum to enforce their rights
vis-a-vis the state.
* Strengthening the Official Infornation Commission to facilitate public access to information
under the Official Information Act.
* Adopting measures to protect civil servants who provide evidence and creating an ethics
promotion center.
* Developing a better enabling environment for civil society to monitor public performance and
participate in policy-making.



To reach these objectives, Thailand has completed the first stage of refonns in this area,
including enactment of the Organic Law on Ombudsmen and the Law on Administrative Courts,
appointing members of the National Counter Corruption Commission and submission of the draft
organic Law on Counter Corruption to Parliament.

ANNEX 1
ANNEX 1: PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM AREAS
I. EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT
Institutional Arrangements for Expenditure Management
The performance of a country's institutions for formulating and executing fiscal policy critically
depend on the incentives governing the size, allocation and use of budgetary resources. Institutional
arrangements shape the quality of outcomes on four levels: (i) aggregate fiscal discipline, (ii) resource
allocation and use based on strategic priorities (allocative efficiency); (iii) efficiency and effectiveness of
programs and service delivery (technical or operational efficiency), and (iv) transparency of the system.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of Thailand's budgetary institutional arrangements and what
reform strategies can be suggested to improve budgetary outcomes at all four levels?
Thai budget processes are strongly centralized by the standards of well-performing countries.
This ensures effective achievement of overall fiscal targets. However, aggregate fiscal control is achieved
at a price in terms of allocative and operational efficiency. This is due to the inflexibilities and distortions
which a highly centralized approach to budget allocations imposes on public organizations. Public
organizations face no incentives to use the budget process as an essential management tool wherein policy
solutions to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and equity of their programs are discussed. Thai public
organizations perceive the budgetary process as a procedural requirement imposed on them by central
agencies to which they must adhere. Such an environment precludes using the power of the public purse
to demand performance from line ministries.
Expenditure management in Thailand is poorly prioritized, pays minimal attention to the results
of spending, and lacks accountability for the quality of services provided. Linkages among planning,
budgeting and sectoral policy are weak. The fiscal planning process has an annual focus and lacks a
medium-term approach. It is based on cash flows of central government and does not cover non-
budgetary fiscal operations like contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal operations. Fiscal accounts are not
fully transparent and do not meet the minimum standards of generally accepted international practices.
Expenditures and subsidies to reduce poverty are often ineffective due to poor targeting and limited
evaluation.
Moreover, the lack of transparency in using revolving funds, extra-budgetary funds, quasi-fiscal
operations and foreign financing dilute the financial accountability of ministries and public organizations
to the central agencies.  These non-transparent, off-budget accounts are accompanied by central
guarantees. These accounts grant discretionary use over substantial public resources to the Government
without Parliamentary scrutiny and authority. This situation distorts the prioritization and allocation of
public resources, and diminishes public accountability and public trust in the Government.
Strategies for Reforming Expenditure Management
As described above, Thai public organizations exhibit very low levels of financial and
performance accountability. Budget formulation processes must be reformed to provide performance
incentives by granting greater budgetary flexibility to public organizations in return for improving their
performance and financial management systems. Public reporting frameworks must be reformed to
improve the fiscal and financial transparency at all levels of govemment. To meet the demands of a
globalized economy, expenditure management must achieve the key objectives outlined in the
Government's Cabinet resolution on Public Sector Reform over the next few years: (i) introducing



- 46 -
ANNEX 1
performance-based budgeting for line ministries, (ii) strengthening the capability of central agencies to
review and evaluate sector policies and performance, (iii) improving fiscal transparency. Provided there
is sufficient political will, several critical reforms can be realistically implemented to achieve these
objectives. The following sections describe the rationale and the reform actions which are underway in
each of the three reform areas. The matrix links these reform areas and actions with the Public Sector
Reform Loan.
Implement Performance-Based Budgeting for Line Ministries
While the concept of performance measurement is not unfamiliar in Thailand and the budget
coding structure would support program budgeting, program and performance budgeting has not been
implemented extensively. In each step in the budget cycle -- planning, preparation, execution, monitoring
and evaluation, and audit -- it is possible to identify weaknesses, and some fundamental deficiencies, that
'inhibit the operation of a system designed to deliver outputs, with agencies accountable for the quality of
delivery. The core objective of expenditure management reforms in Thailand is to delegate the necessary
flexibilities in resource use to managers at the service delivery level combined with improvements in their
financial and performance management. Sector ministry performnance can be measured across two
dimensions: (i) their ability to reflect Cabinet priorities in their strategic plans and (ii) their ability to
deliver promised results.
The reforms begin by identifying strategic priorities across the Government: key ministries,
departments and public organizations will be required to produce strategic plans showing their objectives
and desired outcomes, outputs, performance standards, management plans and resource requirements.
These plans will be published and disseminated widely. Central agencies will review these strategic plans
as part of the budget formulation process with an emphasis on whether they reflect the govemment-wide
priorities and whether they are well prepared. After this review, resource agreements will be formed
between the central agencies and line ministries where, for a given level of resource allocation and
flexibility, the expected performance of a line ministry will be clearly defined and agreed. This provides
the foundation for a new budget formulation process that focuses not on inputs but on outcomes and
outputs. Central agencies would gradually devolve detailed line item controls to line ministries,monitor
their performance and hold them accountable for results. Management reforms within the line ministries
would shift the management culture from "compliance" to "managing for results."
Improving the management of outputs and outcomes rather than input controls relies primarily on a
shift toward performance. The task of the central agencies -- particularly the Bureau of the Budget -- is to
define the new "flexibility and accountability" framework for sector ministries and then to enable the
sector ministries to implement the framework.. The Bureau of the Budget has been developing the
framework for this delegation in the context of perfornance-based budgeting. This involves three
changes to current budgeting arrangements:
*  The Bureau of the Budget (BoB) will 'broad band' existing, highly detailed line items in the budget
(workplans and objects of expenditure) to grant line ministries greater freedom in spending the funds
they are allocated.
*  In this more devolved environment, line ministries will develop greater responsibility for pro-actively
improving their program outcomes. This responsibility will stem from developing their capability for
review and re-prioritization rather than simply perpetuating past spending patterns. However, broad-
banding line items in the budget does not itself ensure that line ministries will actually re-prioritize
their actions. To the contrary, it is likely that a performance focus within line ministries will develop



- 47 -
ANNEX 1
only slowly after financial decontrol, increasing rather than reducing the possibility of waste and
misuse of budget funds in the de-controlled environment.
*  Financial decontrol for individual spending agencies will therefore take place only when 'threshold'
financial control and performance reporting systems are in place in the agency (i.e. a 'hurdle'
approach to financial decontrol). The hurdle approach provides both an incentive to line agencies to
improve their management (in order to win the benefits of financial decontrol by BoB) and a
safeguard against misuse of the new freedoms.
The performance-based budgeting framework includes:
*  clear rules for sector ministries to allocate resources to service delivery organizations
*  principles, standards and guidelines issued by central agencies to implement sound financial
management systems at the service delivery level
*  performance reporting requirements for service delivery units covering objectives, success factors,
performance indicators and service standards
*  capacity building activities in BoB to improve its capability to monitor, review and evaluate
performance and analyze policy.
The BoB has already identified pilot departments in the Ministries of Public Health, Education,
University Affairs, Commerce and Foreign Affairs where this framework will be implemented. Within
this framework, the BoB will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the responsible Ministry
indicating the steps for increasing flexibility by broad-banding budget line items in pilot departments.
These MoUs specify what the future requirements will be and identify the terms of reference for gap
analysis and gap filling in the following core areas:
*  Budget planning and forward estimates
*  Activity costing
*  Procurement management
*  Budget/funds control
*  Asset management
*  Financial reporting and enquiry
*  Internal audit
*  Performance measurement
MOUs also specify the dates and actions for reaching a "Resource Agreement" (RA) between the
BoB and Ministry. During the formulation of the year 2001 budget, these ministries and service delivery
units will set performance targets and a block grant will be agreed to that allows flexibility among line
items. The RA will a!so include forward estimates that will provide the basis for medium-term
predictability of budgetary resources. The RA will also require the ministries to benchmark the
performance of their service delivery units against best practices, to set annual quantitative performance
targets, to undertake customer satisfaction surveys and to publish clear service charters and standards.
At the same time, the Comptroller General's Department (CGD) is identifying the financial
reporting requirements for ministries and departments, improving the Government's accounting policies,
and developing an integrated financial management system that will define government-wide standards
for the "financial management" issues listed above. Ministries and departments will also be required to
report their off-budget fiscal operations (e.g., revolving funds, extra-budgetary funds, foreign finance
projects and quasi-fiscal operations) as part of their financial statements.



-48 -
ANNEX 1
With continuous review and refinement by the BoB and CGD, this performance-based budgeting
framework will be extended progressively to other ministries and departments during the next three years.
At the end of the PSRL program, the framework will be extended to all budget-funded entities. The
expected outcomes of these reforms are:
* improved performance accountability and transparency in key ministries
* policy objectives are linked with organizational objectives at the ministry and agency level
* budget formulation process is directed towards achieving results
* public resources are allocated to strategic priorities of ministries
* managers have more flexible resource use and BoB holds them accountable for probity and
performance.
Strengthen the Capability of CentralAgencies to Review and Evaluate Sector Policies
and Performance
In the new performance frarnework, as central agencies relinquish line-item control they focus
more on reviewing and evaluating the performance of ministries and departments and on analyzing
whether their polices are consistent with the Government's strategic priorities. Hence, another element of
the "performance based budgeting framework" is improving the capability of the BoB and NESDB to
review and evaluate performance and policy.
The BoB's assessment of the geographical distribution of major government programs in the
health and education sectors documented that the current distribution does not reflect the Government's
"equity" and "poverty alleviation" policies. The BoB will publish this expenditure assessment report
within the next months. Given Thailand's extreme regional disparities, the Government can play an
important role in reducing regional inequalities by geographically targeting its spending progressively
towards poorer regions, since overall public spending is not pro-poor.
A general symptom is the pro-rich geographic targeting of public expenditures at the sectoral
level. Incomplete estimates based on outlays incurred at the regional government level indicate that the
Northeastern region receives the lowest per capita outlays in agriculture, education, health and social
services. Overall, the regional expenditure elasticity with respect to provincial GDP increased to + 0.45
in 1997. In other words, a 10 percent higher income level is associated with 4.5 percent higher public
spending. Thus the pattern of regional government expenditures is not pro-poor but instead reinforces the
underlying income disparities. These distributional patterns must be transparently accounted for
including the spatial allocation of outlays by central ministries -- and the trends monitored over time.
The Development Evaluation Division of NESDB is financing a project on Establishment of Key
Indicators System for the 8th Plan Monitoring and Evaluation, financed by the ADB' The project is
applying new methods of poverty measurement that incorporate detailed data on spatial price differences
among provinces -- a major improvement over the aggregated poverty lines originally introduced by the
World Bank. It is also developing a comprehensive monitoring system for evaluating changes in welfare
at the provincial level, including selected data on public expenditures. The results of this work were
presented to the Cabinet, which adopted a resolution that the new poverty estimates should be used to
guide the distribution of public expenditure programs by sectoral agencies. Thailand's Public Sector
Reform Program (PSRP) will aim to support practical implementation of this important resolution.

Plan Monitoring and Evaluation, Development Evaluation Division, National Economic and Social
Development Board.

ANNEX 1
The two main objectives for change are to strengthen the information base for regular monitoring
of distributional incidence of government expenditures, and to institutionalize the routine use of
distributional criteria in making ex ante expenditure decisions for improving progressivity of subsidies.
Key policy actions to implement these objectives focus on monitoring distributional incidence. The BoB
and NESDB will undertake the following activities to develop recommendations for better targeting of
public services and subsidies to low-income groups in the health and education sectors:
*  NESDB will undertake a multipurpose household survey on the utilization of public services in health
and education.
*  BoB will undertake a sample survey of unit costs, prices and subsidies of pilot public services in
health and education NESDB and BoB will develop key objectives, success factors and performance
indicators for inter-ministerial programs in poverty alleviation.
*  BoB prepares resource agreements with program managers based on outputs they produce for poverty
alleviation programs.
*  NESDB and BoB review the results of poverty alleviation programs.
Coordinated evaluation and policy analysis between BoB and NESDB is uncommon in Thailand.
Their combined effort will have greater synergy and policy impact. The BoB and NESDB have agreed to
prepare a joint evaluation work-program with the Ministries of Health and Education and to submit them
to the Cabinet. This work program will serve as a vehicle to coordinate their actions with the sector
ministries at the Cabinet level. At the end of the PSRL program, coordinated efforts between NESDB
and BoB in reviewing and evaluating performance and analyze policy will result in:
* transparent and effective government programs in key sectors such as health and education
*  improved policy analysis and prioritization in these key sectors
*  improved poverty alleviation focus to resource allocation process
*  effective evaluation that provides feedback to decision-making
Improve Fiscal Transparency
Another component of expenditure management reforms in Thailand relate to the need to enhance
"fiscal transparency". The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) reviewed the international good
practices in fiscal transparency, which, unfortunately do not apply in Thailand at present.  The
Government does not have a clear medium-term fiscal strategy, fiscal planning is based on cash flows of a
narrowly defined central government, the existence of off-budget operations dilutes fiscal responsibility
and accountability, fiscal risks arising from government's contingent liabilities are not considered
properly, lack of ministry and department level financial reporting hides the true cost of their policies and
services.
Improve fiscal transparency. While there is no single government policy to improve fiscal
transparency, the BoB and CGD are working to develop a policy to improve "financial transparency."
The CGD has begun reviewing the guidelines published by the International Federation of Accountants
(IFAC) and the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) on government
financial reporting requirements in order to improve government financial reporting, accounting, policies
and standards along these guidelines. IFAC guidelines show the desirable form and contents of financial
statements at the "whole of government" and "department" level and address accounting policies to
produce these statements. INTOSAI provides implementation guidelines. The new Government
Financial Statistics (GFS) framework developed by the IMF shows how to link these financial statements



- 50-
ANNEX 1
with government's fiscal statements. The CGD has hired consultants to develop the "system architecture
and functional requirements" for the new "financial reporting" framework.
The BoB and CGD have also agreed to develop standards for reporting off-budget fiscal
operations at the department, ministry and whole of government level as part of budget documents and
financial statements. BoB has begun compiling information on off-budget fiscal operations like revolving
funds, extra-budgetary funds, foreign financed activities, quasi-fiscal operations and contingent liabilities.
As a very credible step in this direction, the BoB required the pilot departments in performance based
budgeting initiative to produce financial statements which include all off-budget operations.
During the PSRL program, the following actions will be taken to develop a government wide
"fiscal transparency" policy:
*  CGD and BoB identify standards for reporting foreign-financed activities, contingent liabilities,
quasi-fiscal operations, extra-budgetary funds and government guarantees at the whole of
government, ministry and agency level as part of budget documents and financial statements.
* CGD identifies government financial reporting standards at the whole of government, ministry and
agency level.
* BoB develops the form and content of Government statements of fiscal plans and strategies
Another key issue in fiscal transparency is that Thailand does not yet have an independent
Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) that audits the executive branch and reports to the Parliament. The
Auditor General currently reports to the Prime Minister. The Constitution requires the establishment of a
SAI. A law has been prepared that establishes a collegiate Supreme Audit Institution named the State
Audit Commission (SAC) that will audit the Government and report to the Parliament. Once the SAC is
established it is expected to promote fiscal transparency, to adapt the Generally Accepted Audit Principles
declared by International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) to the Thai government,
and to develop a codes of conduct for Thai public auditors.
Establish a medium-term fiscal strategy. The lack of a medium-term framework in Thailand's
existing budget planning system may reduce operational efficiency in at least two respects. First, the
absence of a medium-term fiscal strategy and the current annual focus of the budget process means that
provision for operation and maintenance of completed projects is not treated on a systematic basis in
budget planning. Given high levels of investment before the economic crisis (and implied high levels of
subsequent recurrent expenditure) this could be cause for concern. Second, the absence of a medium-
term fiscal strategy lessens the certainty of funding for ministries and departments over the medium term,
which restricts their ability to plan spending on work plans and projects over a multi-year horizon.
A key means to provide flexibility in fiscal adjustment is to prepare a medium-term fiscal strategy
within which the Government estimates its resources and calculates the costs of its current policies and
contingent liabilities. Since the aggregate cost of policies is expected to be higher than incoming
resources, policies must be adjusted to fit available resources.  This information will enable the
Government to make strategic choices on how to cut expenditures while protecting its priority programs -
thereby improving the quality of fiscal adjustment. Furthermore, this framework encourages more
predictable resource flows to sector ministries and program managers, and eliminates resource constraints
being used as a justification for low performance. Conservatively defining the medium-term aggregate
resource base will also help to change the psychology of budgeting from a "needs" to an "availability"
mentality.
The introduction of a medium-term fiscal strategy will facilitate the link between policy, planning
and budgeting (see Figure 1.1 below). Under this strategy, the financial decontrol offered to the pilot



- 51 -
ANNEX 1
agency is reinforced by a set of firm estimates of budget funding which BoB will make available to the
agency over the subsequent three years. Medium-term forward estimates are the future budget allocations
implied by existing policy settings. Any new policy is excluded from these forward estimates, and
requires an explicit cabinet decision during preparation for future budgets.
The medium-term fiscal strategy provides the agency with a surer medium-term environment
within which to plan its future program allocations in the decontrolled environment. It also enables new
spending decisions to be made by the Thai Government with full knowledge of their medium-term
implications for the budget deficit, and cuts in particular activities that are difficult to achieve in a single
budget can be programmed over a period of three years subsequent to the budget.

At the end of the PSRL program, a government-wide "fiscal transparency" policy will provide:
* A Fiscal Strategy which extends over the "general government financial position" and has a medium-
term outlook.
* Extended coverage of government operations in budget documents and financial statements.
* Improved financial reporting across the government.
*  Creation of an independent and competent Supreme Audit Institution.

II. HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Weaknesses of Tlhailand's Public Administration
Weak civil service performance has been recognized as a key obstacle to Thailand's economic
development objectives for several years. The lack of a service-oriented, cost-effective civil service
driven by results rather than entitlements has impeded the implementation of government programs.
Public confidence in the quality and probity of civil service management has eroded. The recent financial
crisis has brought the shortcomings of the Thai civil service into even sharper relief, underscoring citizen
dissatisfaction with government deficiencies and highlighting the need to strengthen civil service capacity
to carry out those public activities needed to spur the resumption of economic growth.
Several key problems are linked to civil service under-performance. First, the role, organization,
and processes of government are in need of serious overhaul. Central government administration
conducts various activities that in other countries are privatized, localized, or spun off to a non-core, more
flexible govemment sphere. And initial investigation suggests that duplication of functions is widespread
throughout government, even for those tasks which might be consensually acknowledged as appropriate
for central government to perform. Business processes in most government offices are antiquated,
cumbersome, and control-oriented. Governed by the Administrative Procedures Act, administrative
practices are inefficient and often without access to leading-edge technologies and approaches that could
streamline implementation. Such practices emphasize adherence to internal controls, often at the expense
of better service to citizens. Moreover, government structures operate as independent entities with
minimal capacity for cross-sectoral or agency coordination and little inter-departmental, much less inter-
ministerial, staff mobility. Paradoxically, the lack of coordination among central agencies belies an
extremely centralized model of administration and decision making, affording little managerial flexibility
or discretion - over financial or human resource choices - to line agencies.
Second, per unit of output, the civil service is costly. Manpower levels are considerably higher
than those for neighboring country civil services in relation to population and total employment.
Personnel expenditures constitute a relatively large proportion of total expenditures (over 42 percent). The
provision of complementary inputs (e.g. chalk for teachers or fuel for agricultural extension agents'
transport) through spending on goods and services has been crowded out over the last several years by
personnel costs, hampering the ability of civil servants to deliver results. Despite high levels of aggregate
expenditures on wages, individual compensation for civil servants- especially at higher skill levels - is
low relative to private sector labor markets.  Thus, recruitment and retention of quality staff is
increasingly difficult. In addition, moonlighting inside economic activities and corrupt practices among
civil servants with particular access to rents is anecdotally reported. Efforts to restore civil service
remuneration levels have been incremental and indirect, resulting in a complex web of opaque
allowances and benefits, mainly driven by status and seniority rather than job qualifications or
performance. Consequently, policy makers and managers have only a hazy picture of real remuneration
across government, making rationalization of financial incentives and, indeed, aggregate wage bill policy
management, exceedingly difficult within the present system.
Third, the current organizational culture deters professional performance, accountability and
citizen-responsiveness among civil servants. Systems for performance evaluation are under-designed and
un-enforced, and remuneration and career advancement have only minimal links to job-related
qualifications or results. Political criteria reportedly figure prominently in civil service appointments and
decision making, from the higher levels down to unusually low levels of the bureaucracy. Civil service
probity has been undermined by the absence of a clearly articulated or enforceable ethical code for
government service and by low salaries. Although increasingly open debate within the press and other
institutions in civil society has shone a powerful spotlight on these problems, political opening has also



- 53 -
ANNEX 1
accelerated pressures on the bureaucracy to distribute spoils and patronage in exchange for political
support. And, although public demand for quality service is now better organized and articulated, the
Government is only beginning to develop the standards and behaviors to respond to that demand.
Current Reform Efforts
An improved public administration will be a key ingredient in reviving sustainable growth in
Thailand. For instance, a key factor that foreign investors look for before making substantial investments
is a strong, impartial Civil Service. Another aspect that will demand the attention of politicians in
containing budgetary expenses over the medium term is the current, high budget allocations for public
sector employment - far higher than most other countries, and indicative of under-performance and over-
staffing. Most important will be the capacity for policy making and implementation, which will require
effective performance-oriented coordination among central agencies and service delivery units.
Efforts to restructure and reorient the civil service to improve its performance have been initiated
on several fronts. In the main, however, these efforts have been undertaken on a piecemeal, pilot basis
rather than as part of a coordinated civil service reform strategy. For example, the Office of the Civil
Service has, with UNDP funding, piloted process re-engineering and structural reforms in five
government departments through its Public Service Performance Improvement Project. Using some of
the approaches and staff trained through this exercise, OCSC has begun a series of ministerial reviews.
OCSC staff have also been working as "consultants" in a limited number of central agency departments
(for example, in the Motor Vehicle Department of the Ministry of Land and Transportation) to press for
performance improvements. In addition, service improvement has been sought through a program to
install government-wide service standards. The need to raise the importance of public administration
reform on the political agenda has been recognized by OCSC -- its choice of ministries for re-engineering
show an intent to improve effectiveness and efficiency in areas that would directly benefit the economy:
Ministry of Commerce (focus on commercial development), Ministry of Finance (focus on country's
financial management) and Ministry of Labor & Social Welfare (focus on the workforce).
Although the implementation of this program is still in its infancy, service standards were
catalogued as early as a decade ago in a government publication that may be likened to the UK Citizens'
Charter. In addition, manuals detailing the service levels citizens may rightfully demand, and an outline
of procedures and behaviors government employees should follow in order to respond to these demands
have also been published. A Cabinet resolution to codify, service standards and procedures has been
passed. In addition, OCSC has solicited ministerial inputs and has developed early proposals for
"rightsizing" government by reducing civil service cadres through early retirement, outsourcing, and
organizational restructuring.  A significant element in restructuring may involve the creation of
autonomous public organizations, quasi-independent agencies that are to be spun off from core
government.
The focus of further work on administrative renewal includes pilot ministerial reviews and
executive agency development, design of pay- and promotion-for-performance mechanisms, senior
executive service, position classification systems, and transitional post-redundancy mechanism design.
The organizational home for this work so far has been the OCSC, as the management body for the Civil
Service, and the secretariat for the Civil Service Commission itself and for the Public Service Reform
Committee. The latter, in principle, provides a policy umbrella for government-wide institutional
changes.

ANNEX 1
Strategies for Public Administration Reform
Effective civil service reform must focus on three important objectives: (i) enhancing the quality
of service through more effective perforrnance; (ii) increasing the efficiency of government operations by
reducing its cost; and, (iii) reducing the scope for corruption and political interference in civil service
activities.
Several inter-related measures are proposed to achieve these reform goals. The first strategy
involves developing detailedprograms to align organizational structures of line ministries with their new
functional objectives to achieve the optimal mix of government functions and most efficient processes and
staffing allocations for effective policymaking and service. As a second strategy, this will likely include
matching staffing profiles and numbers to the new functional requirements of the civil service and
containing the cost of government through various mechanisms. The third type of measure entails
developing modern, performance-based human resource management systems for civil service. This may
include an updating of out-of-date procedures, or the introduction of performance management through
results-based human resource approaches that couple greater managerial discretion with performance
incentives. A fourth strategy entails developing a well-motivated, politically neutral, cross-governmental
senior cadre to lead civil service renewal program, which would build a professional class of higher civil
servants. The final measure requires developing a regulatory framework for autonomous public
organizations (APOs).
To work effectively toward realistic reform goals, all of the measures require early decisions
about the nature of the public management system the RTG envisions for the next century. For example,
performance can be improved incrementally within a relatively centralized model simply by modernizing
antiquated personnel systems. Or it can be enhanced by moving more radically toward devolving
management autonomy to executive government agencies subject only to running cost restrictions.
Alternatives between these two options may also be considered. In any case, a minimal roadmap of
reform is a pre-requisite for a sensible and robust change program.
Develop Detailed Programs to Align Organizational Structures of Line Ministries with their New
Functional Objectives
To improve the efficiency of the civil service and ultimately the performance of public sector, the
Government must re-evaluate the role of the state and provide an overarching vision of the direction for
reform. Such a vision would include functional, organizational, and procedural elements: what would the
public sector do; how would these functions be structured and organized within government; and what
would the processes and accountabilities look like throughout the government sector? Such decisions
naturally lead to further choices about allocation of financial and human resources to perform those
activities within the state's purview. This type of functional review of the state's role, functions and
processes must occur at the macro- as well as micro-organizational level. A cross-governmental view
will allow policymakers to assess appropriateness or redundancy of organization and function for the state
as a whole. It would also be a first step towards redefining the roles of the central agencies (OCSC,
Ministry of Finance) to take on roles as regulators of government services, ensuring adequate service
delivery by the agencies.
This functional review must necessarily incorporate findings from and contribute a broader vision
to a series of strategic reviews to be undertaken at the level of policy and line ministries and departments,
where the general principles of state reform can be worked out on a detailed, concrete basis. Reviews will
analyze organizational mission, strategy, functions, processes and incentives, and staffing, again, driven
by the overall government strategy and performance management framework built on the introduction of
new flexibility and accountabilities. In addition, reviews must capitalize upon and, to the extent possible
and appropriate, unify the disparate approaches currently being used by the OCSC in its management



- 55 -
ANNEX 1
improvement work. Once a prototype for this unified approach has been established, it will be important
for the Government to move energetically beyond the pilot phase to complete a critical mass of reviews in
order to ensure adequate momentum for the reform program. It will also be important to carry out this
work through a joint effort by OCSC with the other key actors of the reform program, since revised
functions will cut across human resource and financial management.
Match Staffing Profiles and Numbers to New Functional Requirements of Civil Service and Contain
Cost of Government
One significant product of the ministerial review process will be proposals for "rightsizing" the
civil service according to the newly defined tasks and staffing requirements. Depending upon the model
chosen by government, outsourcing, Autonomous Public Organizations, and ministerial abolition or
consolidation may all result in staffing shifts or reductions. Engineering of new, mechanized business
processes may also change the nature of demand for staff. These individual organizational analyses will
be essential to fine-tuning staffing allocations. Should the Government select a devolved managerial
model, many of the personnel changes may well be undertaken at the initiative of individual managers to
whom human resource decisions on hiring and rewards would be assigned.
Pending such a decision, however, it may make sense to undertake more global analysis of
rightsizing options. Such analysis would involve constructing a basic model of the future civil service.
For example, assuming wage bill neutrality, five years hence, the civil service will require which types of
cadres with what skill and age profiles, and, in light of civil service reservation wages in the overall labor
market context, at what cost? Present redundancy plans, including the numbers and types of staff to be
separated, as well as the appropriate mechanisms (i.e. early or voluntary retirement, natural attrition, or
retrenchment) and their short and long-term costs will be carefully evaluated in light of the reform
objectives. For example, OCSC's early retirement plan will be assessed as one out of various options in
light of the overall rightsizing targets. Again, although these decisions may ultimately be best taken at a
more micro-level, a general view of the future goals of civil service rightsizing is necessary to sound
redundancy program design. A critical element in success of a right sizing strategy will be the
appropriate design of separation packages.  As the single most important employment transition
mechanism, they must be developed both to capture the reservation price for separated employees and to
avoid the adverse selection problems so prevalent in voluntary departure programs.
On the other hand, support for those types of transition mechanisms intended to provide a "soft
landing" for redundant civil servants should be undertaken only with considerable caution since their
value is mainly of a political nature. While social safety nets applied to the impoverished population
more broadly affected by the financial crisis may be an appropriate object of extemal support, targeted re-
training and credit schemes for civil servants per se have a poor success record worldwide, given the
difficulties in pinpointing guidance and training to fast-evolving private sector needs.
Develop Modern Performance-Based Human Resource Management Systems for the Civil Service
Organizational incentive structures. Reorienting the Thai civil service toward performance will
require a shift in both organizational as well as individual incentives. On an organizational basis, work
that has already begun toward the development of performance measurement will be refined and adapted
to individual departmental conditions but also integrated into a more coherent cross-government
approach. So far, OCSC has experimented with at least three different techniques. A decision will be
taken as to the course the Govemment wishes to follow to integrate performance measurement into a
larger approach to performance management more broadly - without which performance measures
mainly become unused data - will be developed. Here, again, the Government's approach to performance

ANNEX I
management can usefully focus on improvements in core government departments without proceeding
down an unheeded path to devolved agency management.
Individual incentive structures. Appropriate individual incentives are an integral component of a
well-performing civil service. Line ministries will find it difficult to meet performance objectives if their
personnel are not adequately motivated. A number of changes will be effected. Key reforms include
revised administrative guidelines and a restructured pay and grading system with increased simplicity,
flexibility and transparency. Based on an accurate private-public pay comparator survey, the new system
will be referenced (though not equated with) to targeted benchmark jobs in the private sector to ensure
cadre retention; introduction of an enforceable performance evaluation system linked to career
advancement, training and, if appropriate, remuneration. Clear job descriptions linked to a corresponding
training scheme for acquiring the necessary skills will be an important part of a modernized human
resource management to build capacity in the Thai Government.
Devolution of authority. Changes in incentive structures will be introduced in the context of
greater managerial flexibility and discretion. This involves greater devolution of decision making
authority to line managers, including personnel decisions and control over resources. The degree of
change in incentive structures must be considered from a system-wide basis in order to structure
incentives properly. However radical the changes, the degree to which individual (or team) performance
is to be emphasized through these personnel management system reforms must be linked directly to those
performance management shifts that take place at the organizational level. In turn, both micro- and
macro-organizational changes will be reinforced by reforms of the financial management system.
Develop Well-Motivated, Politically Neutral, Cross-Governmental Senior Cadre to Lead Civil Service
Renewal Program
The thrust of the above reforms would be to substitute performance for automaticity in civil
service management. Personnel management reforms will also seek to insulate civil servants from undue
political pressure and corrupting influence. One potentially important reform to achieve these is the
introduction of a Senior Executive Service (SES) to ensure that candidates for top civil service positions
are appropriately screened for professional merit and are selected on a transparent, competitive basis. The
design of such a system must be carefully considered, as SES applications in many countries have faced
severe implementation difficulties. Nonetheless, in theory, the SES provides the opportunity to shield
higher-level appointments from the most blatant political interference, to establish a new channel for
external, lateral recruitment into the civil service, and to build a cross-government corps of motivated,
well-remunerated civil servants. This might contribute as well to enhanced inter-ministerial cooperation,
by breaking down barriers among segregated, compartmentalized departments and agencies.
Develop Governance Frameworkfor Autonomous Public Organizations
An important option for alternative service delivery mechanisms consists in the possible spinning
off of functions and staff to so-called Autonomous Public Organizations. Building on the experience with
Executive Agencies in New Zealand and the UK, the objective is to devolve functions to agencies which
may enjoy greater autonomy but also greater accountabilities than core government departments. The
legal framework for such organizations is embodied in the Public Organization bill which was passed by
Parliament in early 1999. Key features of APOs are to allow the use of performance contracts for the
CEO, term contracts for staff, and payment of salaries that are independent of the civil service scale.
Since APOs are still part of the government sphere, they can be funded through the budget, making APO
financing secure. The law specifies various arrangements to insulate APOs from political and ministerial
interference through direct reporting requirement to Parliament or the Prime Minister's Office. Similarly,
CEOs could be appointed by cabinet, or nominated by the Minister with approval of Cabinet.

ANNEX 1
In fact, many public sector organizations are already operating along these lines but on an ad hoc
basis without benefit of a common framework. Moreover, while there has been considerable rhetoric and
some pilot experimentation on performance management - presumably the conceptual underpinning of
the proposed public organizations - a systematic strategy for developing and disseminating
performance-based practice even in existing core governmental agencies has yet to be developed.
Attention to implementing such a strategy for government before launching an unguided spin-off of
public organizations constitutes a more appropriate reform sequence for several reasons. The difficulties
of implementing such agency reforms in advanced countries suggests that careful orchestration is
necessary to their success.  (Precedents for agency reform  operationalization do not yet exist in
developing countries, although cases of public sector fragmentation through the creation of parallel
administrative structures with only limited accountabilities and capacities can be documented). A more
considered approach would emphasize incremental devolution and introduction of performance
management precepts into existing (or perhaps modified) public sector structures.
Most importantly, a governance framework will be developed as an implementing regulation on
the Law on Autonomous Public Organizations. This framework will identify the scope of business;
performance objectives; relationship with parent ministry; relationship with budget; reporting
requirements; delegations for personnel, finance, procurement etc.; setting up initial balance sheets,
accounting policies, borrowing rights, pricing polices, residual government guarantees, dividends and
taxation, efficiency targets, evaluation; accountabilities to legislature and civil society; and the Auditor
General's responsibilities.

III. REVENUE MANAGEMENT
Weaknesses in Revenue Management
The economic crisis in Thailand has highlighted the difficulties in collecting tax revenues. Tax
collections relative to GDP decreased 0.5 percent in 1997 and 0.9 percent in 1998 - declining at rates
beyond what could be explained by the recession; in real terms, collections fell by 9.4 percent in 1997,
and by another 8.3 percent in 1998. Tax arrears have doubled in two years, rising from Bt.35.4 billion in
FY96 to Bt.71.9 billion in FY98 - by January 1, 1999, arrears had increased to Bt.79.1 billion.

Several key problems underscore weaknesses in revenue management.  Tax expenditures,
although costly, are not quantified in the budget nor evaluated for effectiveness. Three government
departments - Excise, Customs and Revenue - have overlapping responsibilities and are poorly
coordinated in capturing potential synergies in administration. Three different taxpayer identification
numbers are used by these revenue agencies (and the Social Security Administration), impeding cross-
checks on compliance. While revenue management encompasses all these areas, the larger and more
pressing problems appear to be improving the tax administration capacity of the Revenue Department (an
overview on the modernization of the Customs Department is in Box 1. 1).
The Revenue Department (RD) is a very large organization of about 18,000 people, spread across
the Kingdom in almost 1000 offices. The task of tax administration is complex, involving meeting
difficult and diverse targets and objectives, such as processing declarations and payments, collecting
debts, combating tax evasion and providing advice and assistance to taxpayers. The complexity of the
work, and the size and geographical spread of the organization require clear organizational objectives and
strategies, defined in a multi-year strategic plan with clearly defined performance indicators - which, at
present, does not exist in Thailand.
Audit performance is weak. Although there are about 3000 audit staff, audit coverage and audit
revenue are both quite low. In FY98, auditors assessed additional tax revenues of Bt 22.3 billion (4.2
percent of total tax revenue collected), though only Bt 3.6 billion of this additional tax was collected (less
than I percent of total tax revenue collected). Many other countries collect 2 to 3 percent of their total tax

ANNEX 1
Box I.1: Modernization of the Customs Department Of Thailand
Since mid-1997, the Customs Department of Thailand has accelerated its efforts to streamline procedures,
contribute to export promotion, enhance revenue collection and increase border protection. It has developed a
comprehensive modernization plan, which is in the early implementation stage. Key features of this plan include
electronic data interchange (EDI), a Gold Card Program, Customs Broker licensing, post-release and post-audit
verification of Customs declarations, adopting the GATT valuation agreement, improved origin and tariff
enforcement, and increased use of high technology to aid border enforcement.
EDI will allow traders to transmit declarations on-line to Customs and use electronic funds transfer to settle
accounts resulting in considerable savings in time and money. It will enable Customs to use electronic profiles to
select high risk shipments for inspection and high risk declarations for verification.  The use of these risk
management tools will expedite the release of low-risk shipments, speed up the settlement of accounts and enhance
detection of non-compliance.
The Gold Card Program will provide qualifying low-risk traders with faster release of their goods from
Customs control and relief from post-release review of their declarations. In return, these traders will maintain
accurate books and records accessible for Customs review as needed.
Customs Broker licensing will give traders access to professional assistance in self-declaring their
Customs obligations. Submission of accurate Customs documents by the trading community will free up valuable
Customs resources to focus on high-risk transactions.
Post-release and Post-audit verification of declarations will assist Customs in focusing in-depth on the
highest-risk transactions without impeding the flow of trade. In the experience of many Customs administrations,
the use of these techniques also leads to increased revenue collection.
In accordance with their WTO commitment, Customs will implement the GATT Valuation Agreement on
January 1, 2000. As Thailand enters into various trade agreements (e.g. AFTA), high-risk areas for origin and
tariff enforcement will change and will require a more flexible and dynamic verification response.
In order to make best use of scarce human resources, one strategy is increased use of high technology to
aid in border enforcement: For example, the use of global satellite tracking technology may enhance control of
shipments moving in transit through Thailand. These operational initiatives are being supported by administrative
initiatives such as a comprehensive human resource plan, improved access to critical operational management
information and an information technology plan.
revenue through additional tax assessed and collected by audit activities. Audit cases take too long to
complete, and audit skills are low. The audit effort receives little IT support. Available data from the IT
system are neither fully reliable nor complete, which restricts the audit division's ability to conduct
market segment studies and develop taxpayer risk profiles.
The RD computer system lacks basic functionality to maintain taxpayers accounts, identify
arrears, select quality audit cases, and provide timely management information. Only some of the
Bangkok offices are networked, and the system is basically unable to provide on-line input or data access.
The need for a working, networked computer system for such a large organization trying to manage
complex tasks with 12 million taxpayer registrations and 5 million active taxpayers, is paramount.

ANNEX 1
Reforms Underway
The RD is in the process of selecting a management consultant to help in preparing a new three-
year strategic plan. A consultant will soon be engaged to provide technical assistance in preparing a new
IT systems and architecture master plan, consistent with the objectives and strategies set out in the
strategic plan.
With the assistance of the IMF, the RD is setting up a Large Business Tax Administration Office
in RD headquarters. Initially, this office will manage 500 of the largest taxpayers, but it is planned to
expand the number to 2500 taxpayers as soon as practical. It is estimated that the largest 2500 taxpayers
account for 50 - 55 percent of total tax revenue collected.
The Large Business Tax Administration Office will manage all tax-related activities associated
with their large taxpayers, including excise tax payments (but not customs activities). This includes
processing tax returns, auditing, collecting arrears, and providing taxpayer service and technical advice.
The IMF has provided a resident tax administration adviser for 12 months to help establish this office.
The IMF has also been providing technical assistance to the Customs Department, although this
assistance is nearing completion.
The RD participated in a Civil Service Commission-sponsored reengineering study assisted by
consultants. The RD provided a large project team to work with the consultants for a one-year period to
pilot new work processes, and the project team is still functioning. However, the new work processes
have not been rolled out beyond the pilot offices.
To improve debt collection procedures, the RD established new delinquency units in three pilot
offices, piloted revised collection procedures, and developed a prototype application to manage
delinquency cases. The pilot project to analyze debts and issue initial demand letters appears to have
been quite successful.
Strategies for Reform
The objectives of the proposed tax administration reforms are to ensure adequate and
sustainable revenue flows in the face of rising fiscal obligations; improve revenue collection,
widen the tax base, and achieve a more equitable distribution of the tax burden; and strengthen
the institutional capacity for efficient and transparent tax collection. These objectives can be
achieved through:
*  improve taxpayer compliance
*  strengthen collection enforcement, and
*  balance business and operational priorities.
Improve Taxpayer Compliance
Numerous measures can be taken to improve taxpayer compliance, including (i) developing and
implementing a more comprehensive audit strategy; (ii) unifying taxpayer identification numbers for all
taxes to enable easier detection of non-filers; (iii) establishing a more streamlined and focused VAT
refund control system; (iv) reducing the frequency of refund claims from monthly to quarterly; (v)



- 61 -
ANNEX 1
implementing a national roll out of the canvassing pilot; (vi) coordinating audit and delinquency
collection; and (vii) improving the quality and availability of data for audit purposes.
Audit plans must incorporate realistic target times for completion of cases, and audit managers
must plan and manage cases better so that the target times can be met. Full-scale auditing will be
replaced by issue-based audits, where only certain aspects of each taxpayer's business are examined
based on the likelihood of finding significant tax underpayments. Audit case selection methods will be
improved to prioritize cases, focus on industries with high compliance risks, and produce more revenue
per case.
Specific actions to be undertaken as part of the Government's program over the next three years
include:
*  Preparing an audit strategy plan that includes an analysis of the known compliance problems with
different types of taxpayers, and documents their intended strategies for improving compliance in
these sectors of the economy
*  Establishing a Large Business Tax Administration Office to manage at least 500 of the largest
taxpayers
*  Establishing a working group to prepare proposals to reduce taxpayers' compliance costs
*  Identifying legal changes required to allow auditors to conduct partial audits and target high-risk
taxpayers, and to remove the requirement for taxpayers to file NIL Personal Income Tax returns
a  Preparing user specifications for the taxpayer risk profile and audit case selection applications
*  Designing simplified forms for Excise Tax and VAT
3  Conducting a promotion campaign to encourage payment of taxes through banks
*  Developing and implementing an automated VAT refund system
*  Designing and implementing an automated audit case selection system
At the end of the program period, the reforms to improve taxpayer compliance are expected to
increase the tax base of registered VAT taxpayers by 10 percent, and to increase the additional revenue
that is collected through audit activities to 2.5 percent of total tax collections. The Large Business Tax
Administration Office will also be expanded to manage the largest 2500 taxpayers, who pay more than 50
percent of total revenue collections.
Strengthen Collection Enforcement
There is a pressing need for increased resources (people, equipment, and money) for debt
collection activities in response to the downturn in the economy. The size, importance, and degree of
difficulty of the problem justifies forming a new debt collection management division in RD
headquarters, which would be responsible for determining appropriate debt collection strategies and
policies. This division, which has now been established, will prepare a 3-year debt reduction plan, set
collection targets for each office, develop new enforcement procedures, and monitor debt collection
performance.



- 62 -
ANNEX 1
The first priority will be to contain the growth in total debt by collecting current debts. Quick
action must be taken against enterprises that are still in business and not paying current taxes. An in-
depth analysis must be conducted on the older debt, to sort the taxpayers and their debts into different
categories, and then appropriate strategies developed to deal with each category.
The debt collection management division must also determine what changes in strategies and
procedures are needed to adapt to amendments in the Bankruptcy Law and Civil Process code. In
consultation with other departments and the major financial institutions, the RD will develop a
coordinated approach to managing the older tax debts and non-performing loans owing to the banks.
The pilot project to analyze debts and issue initial demand letters will be rolled out in all other
offices. The taxpayer accounting function in the computer system must be quickly developed to provide
accurate and timely information about tax arrears. A debt case management application will be developed
to improve controls over casework.
A major problem that has been identified is that auditors are raising large debts where taxpayers
have no capacity to pay. Audit case selection methods will focus on productive cases in terms of
additional tax and penalties assessed, and potential collectible revenue.  Auditors will be made
responsible for providing initial assistance in the debt collection process (e.g., asking the taxpayer to pay
the debt or to make an offer of payment, completing a standard form appraising a taxpayer's asset
position and ability to pay).
Installment arrangements will be revised to periods no longer than 6 months, and subject to
payment of current taxes on time. Where taxpayers cannot repay the tax debts within this timeframe, they
must either be subject to a formal restructuring process, or the business must be liquidated.
A moderate effort will be directed toward clearing up old debts by writing them off, or at least
formally classifying them as bad debts. Schedules of bad debts to be written off will be prepared and sent
to the Minister of Finance for approval on a regular basis, so that the value of the collectible debt is more
apparent.
The RD currently spends considerable resources on receiving tax payments at cashiers offices
located in every local tax office. This is essentially a banking function. The RD will develop new
procedures to collect these payments through the banking system, thereby removing the need for RI)
officials to handle money and freeing up resources that can be redeployed to more productive activities,
such as debt collection.
At the end of the program period, debt collection performance will improve such that collectible
debt is reduced to a manageable level of no more than 5 percent of total annual tax collections.
Balance Business and Information Technology Priorities
Multi-year strategic plans. The starting point for communicating the organization's objectives
and strategies is the preparation of a multi-year strategic plan, followed by functional or program plans
(such as an audit strategy plan). These plans form the basis for annual business plans that should be
developed by each office or functional unit (including regional, area and district offices). At each level,
performance indicators must be set to measure verifiable outputs in terms of objectives, and these
performance indicators must be monitored on a regular basis. Positive feedback must be provided to
operational units where performance targets are being met, and remedial action must be taken where
performance falls below the agreed targets.



- 63 -
ANNEX 1
IT system improvements. The RD has had significant and on-going implementation problems
with its IT system development. While much hardware, including mainframes and network equipment
has been supplied, the delivery of software applications was plagued with problems and the contract is in
the process of being terminated. A VAT system is in place with limited capabilities. Ability to extract
data from the system in terms of inquiries and reports is very limited. The taxpayer accounting function
is incomplete, and it is impossible at present to determine a taxpayer's total tax liability across all taxes.
On-line inquiry facilities to the taxpayer registration database exist in Bangkok and peripheral areas, but
otherwise inquiry and report facilities are very limited. Generally the system is not Year 2000 compliant.
A valid national numbering system, which is used by all revenue agencies and by the social security
system, must be established for proper control and successful computerization.
An inter-departmental project team will be established with representatives from the Revenue,
Customs, Excise and Social Security Departments to resolve issues concerning a common taxpayer
identification number for use by all revenue agencies, for both business and individuals. Rules about
business registration will be strengthened -- all businesses, particularly small retailers, must have a
taxpayer registration certificate, and must display their business name and taxpayer identification number.
Formal mechanisms for data exchange between Departments must be agreed upon, and incorporated into
IT development plans for each Department. The design of the government information network must be
prepared and approved with some urgency, as it is inefficient for each Department to develop their own
network.
Other issues which will be considered in developing a new IT master-plan include: (i) the need to
integrate or match VAT data with Customs import/export data to help control VAT refund and credit
claims; (ii) the possibility of including Social Security contributions and Excise Tax collection as part of
the Revenue Department's mandate; and (iii) moving towards a full self-assessment system for personal
income tax and company tax.
Specific tasks to be undertaken as part of the Government's public sector reform program over
the next three years include:
*  Prepare a new three year strategic plan and an IT master plan
*  Prepare user requirements and software specifications for each of the main modules for the IT system
in consultation with users
*  Integrate taxpayer registration data, which is presently running as scattered databases, and migrate to
the new system platform
*  Implement an on-line taxpayer registration system for Bangkok offices, and test existing IT system
for Year 2000 problems
*  Migrate existing VAT and Small Business Tax (SBT) data, which is on scattered databases, to new
platform
*  Develop data entry, processing and reporting modules for company income tax and personal income
tax
*  Develop and implement unique taxpayer accounting module
*  Develop data entry, processing and reporting modules for all other tax types
*  Develop debt management and audit case selection modules
At the end of the program period, a functional and integrated computer system will be developed
and operational. Operational requirements are that taxpayer data from tax returns will be input in a timely



- 64 -
ANNEX 1
manner, system data will be available in the main RD offices when required on a need-to-know basis,
taxpayers accounts will be fully maintained by the system, the majority of audit cases will be selected by
the system based on preset criteria, and timely and useful management reports will be available for
management on all aspects of operations.

ANNEX 1
IV. DECENTRALIZATION
Fiscal decentralization is a key means to improve governance. By clearly defining what level of
government is responsible for providing and financing various services and delegating appropriate
authority, responsibility and resources, local services may be provided more effectively and local
accountability may be enhanced. To achieve these potential benefits, however, decentralization must be
done correctly and within the right institutional environment. For example, unless a good system of local
accountability is established, giving more resources to local governments can lead to misused or wasted
funds. Similarly, without an appropriate balance between expenditures and revenues, public service
levels may deteriorate in a decentralized context. And finally, unless local governments pursue
responsible fiscal policies, macroeconomic instability may arise in the form of higher overall fiscal
deficits or central government "bailouts" of weak local governments.
The success of fiscal decentralization will depend on the extent to which political and economic
institutions promote local accountability and responsible fiscal policies. Because these institutions are
often weak or non-existent, successful decentralization programs incorporate gradual processes that
emphasize long-term institution building. Such reforms are based on the identification of priority areas
for greater decentralization, the allocation of adequate local resources, incentives for developing
transparency, opportunities for local governments to gain experience and build capacity, growth in
constituent demand for good local governance, and the ultimate establishment of greater accountability.
The development of these political and economic institutions and local accountability structures are
critical tasks in Thailand.
Decentralization, identified as a policy priority in Thailand's 8th National Economic and Social
Development Plan, was featured prominently in the new Constitution: Chapter 9 specifies principles of
local autonomy and elected local representatives, among other aspects of local governance. Thailand is a
highly centralized country with limited local autonomy in terms of functions, area, staffing, funding and
decision making.
* The central government spends 93 percent of total general expenditures and collects 95 percent of
general tax revenues.
*  Only 25 percent of municipal revenues are locally collected and retained.
* The central government appoints chief local officials, determines local salaries and approves local
budgets.
Reducing the role of the central government and moving toward a decentralized fiscal system will
require significant changes in existing institutions, processes and culture.  At the same time,
decentralization reforms can provide synergies in overall public sector reform. Functional reviews of line
ministries (performed as part of fiscal management reforms) will identify opportunities for privatization
and decentralization of service delivery. Changes in the intergovernmental transfer system that improve
the targeting of subsidies to the poor enhance the delivery of services. And effective decentralization is
impossible without broader reforms in fiscal management and human resource management.
Ongoing Decentralization Efforts
In January 1997, a Local Fiscal Master Plan was approved by the Cabinet. This master plan was
drafted by the Fiscal Policy Office of the Ministry of Finance and it identified numerous measures (17) to
enhance local revenues, clarify expenditure responsibility, reform the intergovernmental transfer
(subsidy) system, establish systems for monitoring and evaluating local fiscal systems, promote new
methods of mobilizing capital for local investment, and develop local capacity. The Master Plan sets the



- 66 -
ANNEX I
framework for many of the proposed reforms in decentralization, and is expected to be operational within
five years.
Key decentralization reforms envisioned in the Constitution include increasing the share of local
government expenditures, assigning more revenue sources to local governments, and revising the system
of intergovernmental transfers to provide grants in a more transparent and predictable way. Because most
local governments in Thailand are weak in financial management, planning and service delivery, and
generally lack adequate resources to deliver services effectively or to undertake needed capital projects,
implementing the proposed program of decentralization reforms will require significant strengthening of
local capabilities.
A National Commission on Public Sector Reform was established as an outgrowth of the
Constitution, and it includes a Decentralization Subcommittee. This Subcommittee is composed of three
working groups: (i) Local Administrative Organizations, (ii) Improving the Fiscal Status of Local
Governments, and (iii) Local Civil Service Administration. A working principle of the Decentralization
Subcommittee is that no level of local government should be made absolutely worse off as a result of
reforms brought about by the decentralization process.
The Constitution also requires that a National Decentralization Committee (NDC) be established
by October 1999. This Committee would be composed of 30 members - distributed evenly among
central government agencies, local government officials and academics/representatives of civil society -
and would be responsible for clearly defining the Government's decentralization policy, and for
promoting and monitoring the status of decentralization initiatives. The Head of the NDC would be
selected by the Cabinet and subject to the approval of the Parliament
Draft legislation has been prepared by each of the working groups to define central-versus-local
responsibilities, reform local budgeting and expenditure management, assign adequate local revenues,
reform the intergovernmental grant system, and design a local civil service. This legislation, which must
be enacted by October 1999, is necessary to establish the framework for decentralization and new
intergovernmental fiscal relations. As noted below in Box 1.2, eight laws are in various stages of
review/passage.
Box 1.2: Decentralization Legal Framework
1. Provincial Administrative Organization Act (effective)
2. Tambon Administrative Organization Act (effective)
3. Municipalities Act (effective)
4. Upgrade Status of Sub-Municipalities to Full Municipalities (effective)
5. Change the Status of BMA (approved by Cabinet)
6. Change the Status of Pattaya City (approved by Cabinet)
7. Master Plans and Procedures of Administrative Power (approved by Cabinet)
8. Establish a Centralized Personnel Body of Permanent Officials of Local Administrative
Organizations (approved by Cabinet)
The last two bills -- which would substantially reform the structure and responsibilities of local
governments -- have been submitted to the Cabinet and presented to the State Council for technical
review. During the review process, many elements of these laws have been changed by the State Council.
It has been suggested that the State Council has proposed these changes because it is unwilling to draft the



- 67 -
ANNEX 1
level of detailed legislation specified in the Constitution and would prefer to have the NDC determine
those details. Given the extraordinary quantity of legislation that is expected to be passed between now
and October, it is very likely that the versions of the laws passed will be fairly general in nature and that
one of the first tasks of the NDC will be to determine the remaining administrative regulations required.
A draft bill to reform the house and buildings tax and land tax into a broad-based property tax has
been reviewed by the state council and is being deliberated in a series of public hearings.  Its
implementation is likely to be delayed until after the economic crisis has abated.
Directions for Reform
Establish capability to support and monitor decentralization. At present, it is quite difficult to monitor
the status of decentralization reforms because responsibilities are shared among numerous ministries and
agencies, and the Government's overall decentralization policy framework is not clearly understood. A
high priority is to establish the NDC and assure that it is adequately staffed and given sufficient resources
to perform its duties. The central government must also develop the capabilities of the NDC to monitor
the status of decentralization -- both in terms of its potential macroeconomic impact and its achievement
of decentralization objectives -- and disseminate information on local government finance on a regular
basis. This information is important in encouraging local accountability, for monitoring the siatus of
decentralization initiatives, and for introducing subsequent reforms in response to the dynamic nature of
intergovernmental fiscal relations.
Devolve appropriate e-xpenditure functions. The NDC must clearly define central-local expenditure
functions, i.e., identifying specific expenditure assignments which are compulsory rather than voluntary.
Only with clarity in expenditure assignment can the overlapping functions performed by the central and
local governments be eliminated, and expenditure effectiveness improved. For those local services most
appropriately provided by local governments (e.g., local roads, solid waste collection, etc.) the central
government's role should be limited to establishing policies, regulating outcomes, and facilitating local
provision (especially through building local capacity through training and other means.) A phased
approach to the devolution of selective functions is recommended so that both the central government and
the local governments are prepared to assume their new roles. Current proposals envision that after two
years, 15 percent of government expenditures would occur at the local level; within five years, 25 percent
would be local; and within 7 years, 35 percent would be local. The cost implications of this devolution of
functions have not been estimated.
The Ministries of Public Health and Education are deconcentrating service delivery to local
entitities (i.e., Local Education Authorities and Provincial Hospitals), that, after many years, may be
transferred to local governments. As initially envisioned, these local entities would be formally distinct
from local governments, although local governments would be represented on local committees for
education and health. In the interim period, the central government will continue to play an important
role in establishing policies, financing service delivery and infrastructure, and regulating service delivery.
The organizational structure, staffing levels and staff appointments of local governments are
currently controlled by central agencies (e.g., the Municipal Personnel Commission and DOLA), thereby
limiting the flexibility of local governments to manage their own personnel.  A separate Local
Government Civil Service Commission, as proposed by the Working Group on Local Civil Service
Administration, should be established and local personnel management authority delegated to local
governments gradually over time.

ANNEX 1
Enhance local revenues/resources. As additional responsibilities are devolved to local governments, they
must also improve their revenue collection, both by reforming existing taxes (e.g. introducing a local.,
broad-based property tax) and by enhancing the collections of their existing charges and fees. Passage
and full implementation of the draft Property Tax Act, which amalgamates the Land and Building Tax
and Land Development Tax will potentially provide municipalities with a significant stream of local
revenues. Concurrent reforms in the Central Valuation Agency (CVA) within the Department of Land
will be undertaken to strengthen the base of the new property tax. Local administrative capacity will be
improved over time to take full advantage of the property tax and other existing revenue sources.
Sharing arrangements for national taxes are being deliberated, both as part of the Local Fiscal
Master Plan, and in light of the increase in the number of municipalities (from 149 to 980 with upgraded
sanitary districts) eligible for allocations from shared taxes. It is estimated that it would require Bt. 2,000
million to hold municipalities "harmless" in allocating shared taxes for the motor vehicle tax to the full
980 municipalities.
Revise intergovernmental grant (subsidy) system. Over 70 percent of the intergovernmental transfers (or
"subsidies") in Thailand are allocated for specific investment projects. The Ministry of Interior allocates
these grants in an ad hoc and highly politicized manner. The amounts allocated vary greatly from year-
to-year, and actual allocations are not known until well after the fiscal year begins. Hence the basic
requirement of a decentralized system having transparent and stable intergovemmental transfers is
violated. Nor do the grants reflect the broader intergovernmental framework and the vertical fiscal
imbalance between the central and local governments.
The NDC will reform the intergovernmental transfer system by reducing the reliance on specific
project grants (due to the highly politicized means of allocation) and increasing the reliance on general-
purpose grants that are allocated according to a transparent formula(e) that addresses vertical imbalance
and equalization objectives.  These grants could also promote accountability by being based on
performance auditing. Matching grants would still be offered for specific investments (though much
smaller in overall magnitude), but a transparent and predictable allocation formula will be used and the
matching share will be increased to promote better projects.
Enhance local accountability. Local accountability must be enhanced if decentralization is to succeed.
Local residents and organizations -- local govemment, business, labor and neighborhoods -- best know
and understand local problems and their feedback -- through civic fora and payment of local taxes and
charges -- is integral to assure high-quality, local decisions. Local governments must not only incorporate
this collective wisdom into their decision making, but must also help neighborhoods, businesses, and
labor participate more effectively in public affairs by increasing their access to and understanding of
public information (including local budgets and development plans).
At present, local officials are not fully aware of their responsibilities and functions, especially in
light of changes legislated in local administrative organization acts. The Government will disseminate
these revised acts to all local officials. Another prospect for enhancing local accountability is to require
the direct election of all local officials. At present, the Governor of BMA is the only directly elected
local official (the Mayor of Pattaya City will eventually be directly elected.) Unless the local citizens
have a direct voice in choosing their leaders, local accountability will not be fully achieved and
mismanagement and corruption may arise.

ANNEX 1
V. CROSS -GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY
Governance in a Nascent Democracy
Accountability of government agencies in Thailand has traditionally been weak and the
functioning of the public sector is characterized by both poor service delivery and perceptions of
widespread corruption. As characterized in the 8th National Social and Economic Development Plan, the
Thai public sector's problems include "centralized power structure, administrative inefficiency, lax law
enforcement, lack of popular participation, unethical and unfair use of administrative power, lack of
administrative accountability and lack of continuity in policy and implementation to meet the demands of
national development plans." These problems are rooted in how Thailand's polity evolved over the years.
Unlike its East Asian neighbors, Thailand was never colonized. Prior to the 1 880s, a feudal elite
ran Thailand's government under the traditional "Sakdina" system. Administrators were tax farmers who
retained a portion of the revenues they collected before passing it on to their superiors and thereby to the
Crown or obtained their remuneration from fees they collected for their services. In the 1880s, King
Chulalongkorn introduced a centralized salaried bureaucracy which gradually took over the functions
previously carried out by tributary chieftains, noblemen etc. However, salaries were "well below levels
required to maintain a high official in a condition befitting the dignity of his position" and members of
royal and noble families dominated the new bureaucracy. The practice of paying officials for services,
and of their retaining portions of what they collected, continued.
In 1932, a new Constitution came into being separating the Crown from the state, and introducing
a concept of public service (as opposed to service to the King). The role of the royal and noble families in
the bureaucracy diminished. Since then, the formal rules of the bureaucracy have prohibited civil
servants from accepting gifts, charging for services, or using public assets for private purposes. Despite
the change, public acceptance of practices that are legally prohibited has continued - e.g. paying officials
for timely performance of functions that form part of their duties. However, recent signs show that the
emerging middle class is beginning to oppose these practices strongly.
Since 1932, the military came to play a major role in government. Army officers have often
occupied positions of importance in the political executive. Over the years, the military and the civil
service became closely intertwined. Several military rulers amassed huge wealth while in office. The
gradual democratization of the Thai polity from the early 1970s saw the rise of a political class. The
political class in Thailand has had a large degree of overlap with business interests. The businessman-
politician group can be sub-divided into the provincial businessmen and the Bangkok businessmen,
whose interests have not always coincided.
The highly centralized, formal administrative set-up facilitated the rise of the provincial business
elite. Although elected local councils existed, key provincial and district officials were appointed from
the center, and were not locally accountable. The local business elite are alleged to have been able to
'capture' the provincial administration through the use of money (e.g. bribery) and through their ability to
influence postings and transfers of officials using their influence over the central political executive. In
the absence of locally accountable provincial officials, they became the channels through which the rural
populace could gain access to officialdom - thereby reinforcing patron-client relationships and
strengthening their hold over the rural electorate. Compliance of the electorate was secured through
strong patron-client relationships and/or outright vote buying.
State power in Thailand has, in the past, been contested and shared between (primarily) these
three groups - the bureaucracy, the military and business-dominated politicians. It is widely believed that
all three of these groups have presided over, and benefited from, various kinds of corruption. The



- 70 -
ANNEX 1
electorate was generally seen as a collection of vote banks that could be counted upon to vote in
accordance with the preferences of the elite. Accountability to the citizenry was very limited.
The gradual rise of the middle class, especially in Bangkok, has in recent years somewhat altered
this situation. The urban electorate can no longer be treated as a vote bank. Recent years have witnessed
the emergence of an active civil society in the urban areas. This change has been one of the driving
forces behind the 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan and the constitutional reform.
The 8h Plan
The 8th National Economic and Social Development Plan (1997-2001) recognizes that the public
sector lacks accountability and mechanisms for public voice in government affairs. The Plan strongly
emphasizes accountability. Section 7 of the Plan focuses on the development of Popular Governance to:
(i) enhance public participation in policy formulation and implementation of government services, (ii)
strengthen the application of the rule of law in public administration, and (iii) improve the public sector's
efficiency and effectiveness in public administration.  Two key strategies are to strengthen law
enforcement and to create an enabling environment to support the participation of all sectors in the
development process.
New Constitution
Thailand's new Constitution, adopted in October 1997, marked a clear break with the past.
Making the wielders of state power accountable to the people is its strong central focus. Among the main
themes of the Constitution there are:
*  An explicit right to information.
*  A requirement to decentralize power to accountable local bodies.
*  State support for some kinds of election campaign expenses.
=  Independent watchdog institutions, with real 'teeth'.
- An independent judiciary, including a system of Administrative Courts to enforce Government
accountability.
*  A requirement for persons holding high office to disclose assets and liabilities, and for this
information to be available for public scrutiny.
*  Special and expeditious procedures for prosecution of high personages for corruption, through a
special 'Supreme Court Division for Persons Holding Political Office'.
*  Enabling environment for public participation in policy formulation and inspecting the exercise of
State power at all levels.
Strategiesfor Reform
The overall strategies of Thailand's public sector reforn program are to strengthen and invigorate
the process of change to a more transparent and accountable system of governance. The specific
objectives are: (i) increased institutional accountability, through the strengthening of formal institutional
structures; (ii) improved access to, and use of, public information by individual citizens and civil society,
including improved responsiveness of the Government in providing this access; (iii)increasing probity in
the Civil Service; and (iv) enhanced civil society participation. Complementary activities involve
improved government procurement procedures to enhance both efficiency and transparency, and
involving civil society in promoting transparency.



-71 -
ANNEX 1
Increase Institutional Accountability
The main thrust of the reform in this area is to build a strong institutional framework for
accountability by establishing and operationalizing effective accountability institutions in accordance with
the mandate of the new Constitution. Among these new or strengthened institutions are the national
counter-corruption commission, the ombudsmen, and the administrative courts.
The National Counter Corruption Commission. A Counter-Corruption Commission had existed since
the mid-1970's, as part of the executive branch of government. Its mandate and power, however, were
limited as the Commission could only undertake preliminary investigation when presented with
allegations of wrongdoing by civil servants. All further investigation was to be carried by the police; and
the disciplining of civil servants found at fault was handled by the relevant line agencies.  The
Commission had no power to investigate members of Parliament or ministers or high officials who had
been out of office for more than a year.
The Constitution of 1997 mandated the establishment of a new National Counter-Corruption
Commission (NCCC) by October 1999, and spelled out the mechanisms and criteria for the selection of
the commissioners to ensure the autonomy of the NCCC (see Articles 297-302). The NCCC is charged
with the review of the reports on assets and liabilities which persons holding certain political positions are
required to submit within thirty days of taking office, within thirty days of leaving office and again within
thirty days of a one-year period following departure from office. The prime minister, ministers, members
of Parliament, other political officials and certain local administrators and elected officials, and their
spouses and children, are all subject to this disclosure requirement. The NCCC has the power and duties
to review these reports for accuracy and to inspect the actual existence and changes of assets and
liabilities of these individuals (Articles 291-296, 301). Moreover, upon an allegation of unusual
wealthiness indicative of corruption, or of malfeasance in office, brought by a quorum of the House of
Representatives or of the Senate, or by no fewer than fifty thousand voters, the Senate can refer the matter
to the NCCC to investigate and report back. In the event the NCCC decides that there is a prima facie
case of wrongdoing, in addition to making its report to the Senate and recommendation for removal of the
individual from office, the NCCC also provides the report to the Prosecutor General for instituting
prosecution in the Supreme Court of Justice's Criminal Division for Persons Holding Political Positions.
If the Prosecutor General fails to bring proceedings as recommended, the NCCC has the power to institute
prosecution itself or to appoint a lawyer to do so in its stead (Articles 303-305).
The nine commissioners of the NCCC have already been selected. A draft organic law on
counter-corruption, which would provide definition of acts of corruption and procedures for accusation
and investigation of corruption, has been submitted to Parliament.
While waiting for the enactment of the law on counter-corruption and the formal establishment of
the NCCC, the provisional office of the NCCC has already begun to assess the challenges it will face and
to formulate a plan of action. In order to accomplish its mandate of review and investigation, the NCCC
will need staff in sufficient number and with appropriate training and experience. Sufficient resources
will be necessary to enable the NCCC to maintain such staffing levels and to ensure their adequate
remuneration. While the NCCC is working toward building the level and capacity of its staff, it will be
seeking the support of the Police Department and the Office of the Attorney General to carry out its
investigative and prosecutorial responsibilities. The provisional office of the NCCC is also focusing on
measures of prevention. It is formulating a campaign of education reaching down to the tambon level of
government and, with the help of the Department of General Education, developing a curriculum on



- 72 -
ANNEX 1
public ethics. The research and planning division of the NCCC will assess and recommend to Cabinet
other initiatives to enhance the prevention of corruption, such as improvement of regulations.
Ombudsman. The Constitution of 1997 mandates the enactment by October 1999 of an organic law on
Ombudsmen which will establish a novel mechanism for grievance and accountability for Thailand. The
Ombudsmen, who are to be no more than three in number, will be selected by the Senate and
recommended for appointment by the King. They have no power of sanction or punishment. Their
mandate is to investigate, on petition from the public, complaints of the failure of individual officials or
government agencies to perform in compliance with the law, or of actions beyond their powers and duties
as provided by law, or of actions or omissions, whether lawful or not, which unjustly cause injuries to an
individual or to the public. In carrying out their fact-finding duties, the Ombudsmen will have the power
to require the cooperation of the relevant agencies. The Ombudsmen will submit their reports, including
recommendations, to the National Assembly.
As of September 1999, the organic law on Ombudsmen has already been approved by Parliament
and is awaiting the signature of the King. The challenges facing this new institution lie in the
identification and selection of qualified individuals to serve as ombudsmen, and in the allocation of
sufficient resources, both human and material, to support the performance of their responsibilities. Of
equal importance is the need to ensure that the population knows of the functions and availability of this
institution, and can obtain access with relative ease. To facilitate access, it is anticipated that offices of
the Ombudsmen will need to be set up not only in the capital area but also in a number of regional
centers.
Administrative Courts. Since the mid-nineteenth century, Thailand has experimented, without great
effect, with various mechanisms to handle disputes between agencies of the State, and between agencies
of the State and private persons. The Constitution of 1997 mandates the establishment within two years of
a system of independent specialized Administrative Courts. The Administrative Courts will have the
duties and powers to try and adjudicate disputes among state agencies or between state agencies and
private persons arising out of actions or omission of such state agencies. To ensure the independence of
the Administrative Courts, the Constitution provides that appointment and removal, promotion and
sanction of administrative judges are not controlled by the Government, but entrusted to the judicial
commission of the Administrative Courts which consists of the President of the Supreme Administrative
Court, nine administrative judges elected by their peers, and three other members two of whom are
elected by the Senate and one by the Council of Ministers. Similarly the Administrative Courts will have
autonomy in the administration of their personnel, budget and other ancillary activities. The current
adjudicatory functions of the Petition Commission of the Council of State will be abolished.
The law on Administrative Courts has been approved by Parliament. Much remains to be done,
however, to make the system of Administrative Courts a fully operational and effective institution.
Judges and court personnel need to be selected and trained; court procedures need to be further
developed; and gradually an entire jurisprudence will need to be formulated. To facilitate access to the
Administrative Courts, the law provides that at least sixteen regional administrative courts will be
established in provincial cities.
Enhance Public Access to Information
Office of the Official Information Commission. The new Constitution establishes the right of an
individual to obtain access to public information prominently among the fundamental rights and liberties
of the Thai people (see Articles 58-59). The Official Information Act was enacted in early October 1997
to define broadly the framework for disclosure and confidentiality of information in the possession or
control of a state agency. To give effect to the Act, an Official Information Commission (OIC) presided



- 73 -
ANNEX 1
over by the Permanent Secretary of the Office of the Prime Minister and consisting of high level
representatives of line agencies, and Information Disclosure Tribunals with specialized expertise in the
fields of national security, economy and finance, science, public health among others, were established.
An Office of the Official Information Commission (OOIC) was organized to support the Commission and
carry out its work. Under the Act, a private person who considers that his or her request for public
information has not been met by the relevant state agency, has the right to bring a complaint to the OIC
which is required to review the complaint and give a decision within thirty days of receipt. The OIC may
refer any appeal against an agency's response to a request under the Act to an Information Disclosure
Tribunal selected for its particular specialization.
Awareness of citizens' right to public information has been on the rise, especially in urban areas.
In recent months, the citizens and media in Bangkok have won highly publicized cases of request for
disclosure of information, including the cases of medical supplies involving the Ministry of Public
Health, of the national budget, of the results of entrance examination in prestigious public pilot schools,
etc. Nevertheless, there are major difficulties in the implementation of the Act: misunderstanding of the
public and the state agencies regarding the law; instances of lack of cooperation from the state agencies;
insufficient staff and resources for the OOIC and limited capacity of the Tribunals to handle the
increasing number of appeals. There is a perceived need for sustained efforts to educate both the state
agencies and the public on the meaning of the law and the procedures it entails. Cabinet has issued an
order to line agencies to organize training programs for their personnel regarding the provisions of the
Official Information Act. The OOIC has prepared clear guidelines in the form of a handbook. It is
expected that within the coming year, agencies will revise their administrative rules and procedures or
issue new ones to enable them to comply more effectively with the Act and the guidelines of the OIC.
Promote Probity Among Civil Servants. Civil servants -- together with politicians -- have been repeatedly
embroiled in corruption scandals that are regularly reported in the media. Whether these are highly
publicized cases (such as those involving the award of a contract for a large infrastructure project) or
simply incidences of petty corruption (for instance, bribing a police officer to avoid a speeding ticket or a
customs official to speed customs clearance), citizens' perception of the transparency and probity of the
civil service affects its performance and potential. A key ingredient of an effective anti-corruption
strategy is to reduce the differential in pay scales between the public and the private sector. Particularly
in the years preceding the crisis, incentives and salaries in the public sector increasingly lagged behind
those offered in private firms -- thus making civil servants susceptible to temptation. A second element of
increased transparency will be the promotion of the code of ethics for civil servants and programs to
familiarize civil servants with its principles. While such a code or associated training is unlikely to serve,
on its own, as a deterrent to corrupt behavior, it can at least define and establish a new accepted practice,
which, so far has remained purposefully undefined and vague in Thai bureaucratic culture. An in-depth
understanding of the informal incentives and opportunities for corruption will be necessary in order to
design a code that can hope to address the real sources of abuse. This reform will be carefully linked to
the redesign of the financial management system and must be buttressed by support from key interests
among the political class and within civil society in order to take root firmly in the Thai environment.
The Office of the Civil Service Commission is establishing an Ethics Promotion Center to ensure
the implementation of the Code of Ethical Standards among government officials, and other employees of
the State. In February 1999, the Council of Minister approved OCSC regulations to protect civil servants
who provide evidence or information regarding corruption., the "Whistle Blower" regulations. The
transition Office of the National Counter Corruption Commission is currently working with the OCSC on
establishing the Witness Protection Plan.

ANNEX 1
Box 1.3: Non-Governmental Organizations Promoting Transparency
The Good Governance Task Force, The Foundationfor Thailand Development Research Institute.
The Good Governance Task Force is headed by former Prime Minister Khun Anand Panyarachun. This Task
Force believes that the most effective way to reform the public sector and mobilize civil society on governance
issues is to work through an independent body outside of the Government. The Task Force has established a Good
Governance Project at the well-known local think-tank, the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). The
Independent Body on Good Govemance would be comprised of representatives from govermment agencies, private
sector and civil society. Under the Independent Body would be a National Committee of leading figures, as well as
working groups that would support the Committee in five major areas of governance: (i) legal reform, including the
new Constitution and all organic laws; (2) public sector reforn, including key government agencies; (3)
transparency and anti-corruption; (4) corporate governance; and (5) increasing public awareness.
The Political Economy Center, Chulalongkorn University.
The Political Economy Center is the leading institution conducting research on corruption and anti-corruption
efforts in Thailand. Renowned academics conduct investigations and surveys, publish monographs, and analyze
issues spanning the Thai bureaucratic system. The Counter Corruption Commission has commissioned several of
these works.
Transparency International- Thailand-Chapter
The Thailand Chapter of Transparency International (TI) has been newly established in conjunction with the
Government's Transparency Working Group. The Group's activities include: (i) awareness-raising and public
education on professional ethics through newsletters and seminars on conflict of interest issues, (ii) consciousness-
raising on anti-corruption issues through newspaper columns, essay contests, citations for best practices, media-TV
features and programs, workshops on transparency and accountability for young people and others, (iii) studies and
research, monitoring of issues and public opinion, an attitude survey on best practices, and ways and means to
counter corruption, (iv) support systems, networking and affiliations to support "whistle blowers," regional,
provincial and local TI affiliates.
Other Non-Governmental Organizations' Activities
Several bilateral donors provide support on anti-corruption and transparency issues in Thailand. For example,
CIDA and the Asia Foundation have been working on "Government Accountability" and transparency programs for
several years. Several Thai NGOs also work as watchdog organizations on particular issues such as the Rural
Doctors Network, the Consumer Protection Network, and the Campaign for Popular Democracy.
Enhance Civil Society Participation
8h National Economic and Social Development Plar.. One of the Government's initiatives to strengthen
accountability and transparency in the public sector is to enhance citizen participation and provide more
opportunities and mechanisms for public voice. The Government has been improving and encouraging
civil society participation in policy-making processes since the drafting process of the 8th National
Economic and Social Development Plan. For the first time in the Thai history, public hearing and
forums were organized throughout the country to gather public inputs for the drafting of the Plan. As a
result, the 8th Plan has a fundamentally different focus from previous Plans. It has called for "holistic
people-centered development", good governance, and civil society participation in national policy
formulation and implementation.
In order to address the perceived weaknesses of the public sector, the 8ih Plan called for the
development of "Popular Governance" by enhancing public participation in policy formulation and
implementation of the government services, strengthening the application of the rule of law in public
administration, and improving efficiency and effectiveness in public administration.



- 75 -
ANNEX 1
The NESDB has established a Sub Committee on "Civil Society" to provide inputs and monitor
the implementation of the 8'h Plan. Representatives of civil society have participated regularly in sub-
committee meetings. In addition, the Development Evaluation Division of the NESDB is developing
indicators to monitor and evaluate public performances.
The National Social Policy Committee. In July 1998, the Government established the National Social
Policy Committee in response to increasing public demand to coordinate social policy, alleviate the
negative social effects of recession, solve poverty problems in both rural and urban areas throughout the
country, and generally integrate the economic, social, cultural, and environment priorities outlined in the
8th Plan. The Committee is headed by the Prime Minister and consists of representatives from key
government agencies, academia, and civil society organizations. The NESDB acts as the Committee's
secretariat. One of the main features of the Social Policy Committee is that it has endorsed the policy to
strengthen human resources for development by minimizing the role of the state and maximizing the
participation of interest groups in civil society. Recently, the Committee has set up a Task Force on
"Strengthening Civil Society" headed by the Minister Attached to the Prime Minister's Office. Task
Force representatives come from government agencies, academia, and civil society organizations. The
Task Force is currently working on improving the enabling environment for civil society to better engage
in policy formulation and implementation at both national and local levels.
Civil society in the new Constitution. One of the notable features of the new Constitution is its explicit
emphasis on the role of civil society in policy making processes. In particular, two articles under the
Constitution establishes policy guidelines for public participation and civil society mechanisms to bring
the government to be accountable to the public:
*  Article 76: The State shall promote and encourage public participation in laying down policies, making
decisions on political issues, preparing economic, social, and political development plans, and inspecting the
exercise of State Power at all levels.
e  Article 89: To implement this Chapter (Directive Principles of Fundamental State Policies), the State shall
establish the National Economic and Social Council to be charged with the duty of giving advice and
recommendations to the Council of Ministers on economic and social problems. A national economic and
social development plan and other plans as provided by law shall obtain the opinions of the National Economic
and Social Council before they can be adopted and published. The composition, source, powers and duties, and
the operation of the National Economic and Social Council shall be in accordance with the provision of law.
Civil Society in the National Economic and Social Council (NESC). To give effect to Article 89 of the
Constitution quoted above, the NESDB was given the responsibility to prepare the draft law on the
NESC. As of July 1999, a preliminary draft has been prepared to define the composition of the NESC
and the selection criteria for its members, and the details of its functions, duties and operation. Under this
draft, the NESDB was striving for the broadest and most faithful representation of Thai civil society
proposing selection criteria based on geography, gender, occupation, etc. Public opinions on this draft
will be sought through public hearings before its finalization and submission to Parliament.
Complementary Reforms
Improving Government Procurement Procedures. Thailand's national procurement process has evolved
over many years and is currently governed by the 1992 Government Procurement Regulations as
amended through 1998. The Bank has been able to promote some inputs in the crafting of these
documents and the regulations per se are sound, and except for a few differences, broadly match the
Bank's own Procurement Guidelines. While instilling a measure of discipline in the mechanics ofthe
procurement process, the regulations have not improved its transparency, and corruption in procurement
among Government agencies is alleged to be rampant and routine at many levels. Powerful external



- 76 -
ANNEX 1
vested interests, which influence the highest levels of Government, tend to exercise disproportionate
influence on procurement, especially when the sums involved are large, and the media have reported
frequent occurrences of collusion among bidders for lucrative contracts.  Political influence on
procurement from within the Government affects both government departments and state-owned
enterprises, through their Boards. Several reputable individuals, who draw support from the population
and the press, have begun to exercise their voice and discontent with established practices. The Bank has
recently become more involved in transparency and governance issues on individual cases; it expects to
make more concerted efforts in this direction through the Country Procurement Assessment Review
(CPAR) exercise which is scheduled to be conducted in late 1999 to complement the Government's
public sector reforn program. In addition, the Law Reform Commission of the Council of State has
commissioned an academic research team to conduct an in depth study on procurement procedures.
Transparency Surveys. An effective campaign against corruption can only succeed with the active
involvement of civil society. The plethora of non-governmental organizations in Thailand and the
country's free press are powerful moderating forces for monitoring and demanding transparency in the
public sector. The Government's public sector reform program will cooperate with key civil society
organizations (including those listed below) that are working on good governance and public sector
reform by engaging them in survey activities, workshops and dialogue. This effort will be supported by
two studies: i) a 'zero-base' regulatory review of two agencies and ii) a comprehensive survey of the
prevalence of corruption.
Zero-base review of regulations. Experience worldwide shows that the potential for corruption in a given
relationship between citizens and the government varies directly with the extent of discretion exercised in
a transaction and possible delays in that transaction. The degree of discretion and delay depend largely on
Government departments' rules processes and procedures which in tum usually stem from a combination
of legislation, ministerial or departmental rules or regulations, precedent and informal practices.
Government rules have a tendency to accumulate as new regulations are issued to meet
developing situations without (in most cases) discarding the old. Vested interests develop within the
bureaucracy and outside in maintaining old regulations. Since departments often operate in a "fire-
fighting mode," fundamental reassessments of rules and procedures are rarely done. The study aims to
conduct a fundamental assessment of rules and procedures as an effort to reduce corruption and improve
service delivery in selected government departments or agencies. It will be conducted by the King
Prajadhipok's Institute - an autonomous public organization attached to Parliament - and will aim to:
*  assess the continued relevance of departmental rules, procedures and processes;
*  identify those that are no longer considered necessary or desirable in public interest and advise on
their abolition or modification
*  suggest -where appropriate-new rules or procedures to replace the old.
The study will take a 'zero-base' approach-i.e. the starting assumption will be that the existing rule
is unnecessary and then each rule or regulation will have to be justified on merits. In carrying out the
study, public aspirations for speed and simplicity in regulation will be balanced with legitimate state
regulatory roles.
Survey on the prevalence of corruption. The Office of the Civil Service Commission, in
collaboration with the World Bank Institute, will carry out a comprehensive survey on perceptions about
corruption. The OCSC will work with the University of the Chamber of Commerce, the Thailand
Development Research Institute, the King Prajadhipok Institute and the Political Economy Center,
Chulalongkorn University to carry out these attitude surveys. The survey will cover households,
businesses and civil servants using a methodology refined by the WBI and already used in several other
countries. It will aim to pinpoint specific problem areas as well as prioritize areas for action. The survey



-77-
ANNEX 1
will compare the perceptions of the three groups and provide the government and civil society with a
strong information base from which to proceed in strengthening the campaign against corruption.
The State Auditor. Under the new Constitution, the State audit shall be carried out by the State Audit
Commission and the Auditor-General. The State Audit Commission consists of the Chairman and nine
other members. As of July 1999, the draft organic law on State Audit has been submitted to Parliament.

ANNEX 2: PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS IN LINE MINISTRIES
Delivering better services in a cost effective way is a key objective of the Government's Public
Sector Reform Program (PSRP). This will require enhancing the access, timeliness and quality of public
services through outsourcing, restructuring or decentralizing activities and being more responsive to
clients. Administrative renewal involves modernizing the role, organization, and processes of key line
ministries to enhance their performance in delivering services. More efficient use of public resources
requires streamlining procedures, eliminating duplicative structures, devolving to local governments or
outsourcing activities inappropriate for government involvement to the private sector.
These objectives will be achieved through a step-by-step process of improving the performance
of selected line ministries. This performance improvement process will involve the close coordination of
the Bureau of the Budget, the Office of the Civil Service Commission, and the line ministries themselves
to achieve synergies in translating public expenditures and human resources into performance. The
performance improvement process will initially be piloted in three priority ministries and will then be
rolled out to other ministries. Building on reform efforts already under way, the first year of the
Government's PSRP will focus on social and economic services delivered by the Ministries of Education,
Health, and Commerce. Other ministries are expected to join the PSRP framework in the second and
third years and will design their reform programs based on the lessons learned from earlier ministerial
reforms. Subsequent phases of the PSRP are likely to focus on other government services with important
economic and social objectives, including the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, the
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
While they share the objective of improving performance, the nature, scope and pace of reforms
across these agencies will have different characteristics. The education and health sectors - which
together account for 40 percent of public expenditures -- are at the core of an ambitious sectoral reform
program. One focus of their efforts is the gradual devolution of budgetary control by the Bureau of the
Budget in return for performance agreements. Other key reforms involve decentralization, organizational
restructuring, service standards and civil society involvement. The much smaller Ministry of Commerce
is the first of the agencies to complete a functional review under the auspices of the OCSC. Over the next
three years, it will focus on organizational restructuring, legal changes and devolution of functions.
The Government's PSRP will support organizational and policy changes bolstered by technical
assistance in pilot ministries, with the aim to achieve the following objectives:
*  Improve the planning capability of sector ministries through functional reviews of program areas and
corporate plans;
*  Improve line ministry performance through performance budgeting, resource agreements and
monitoring with increased flexibility granted by the Bureau of the Budget;
* Align organizational development and restructuring programs for government ministries and
departments with their service objectives;
* Devolve non-core functions to local governments, contract to the private sector or to Autonomous
Public Organizations;
*  Improve the efficiency of service delivery in core areas of ministry activity; and
*  Strengthen human resources and structure staffing levels to meet the ministry's objectives.
By the end of the program period, support through the Government's PSRP should achieve the
following results:



- 79 -
ANNEX 2
*  Completion of functional reviews in social and economic ministries;
*  Creation of corporate plans to reorganize and reengineer social and economic ministries in light of the
functional reviews;
*  Devolution of identified services to local governments or the private sector;
*  Begin rationalizing and reengineering of Ministries through organizational restructuring.
Improving Strategic Planning of Sector Ministries
A key to promoting better allocation of resources is the establishment of strategic results areas
and key results areas for each ministry. A ministry must have a clear vision of its role and this depends in
part on the Government's overall vision for the public sector. Strategic results areas are medium-term
objectives for the public sector that contribute significantly to the Government's longer-term policy goals
and objectives. Key results areas define the critical areas that each ministry focuses on in the medium
term in contributing to the Government's strategic results areas. Establishing a corporate plan which
includes the vision and mission statements along with key results areas and performance indicators will
enable ministries to specify clear strategies for moving towards a results-oriented public service.
Functional Reviews and Corporate Plans
Organizational renewal in the selected line ministries will begin with Functional Reviewsthat will
first examine the mission objectives of each ministry. Second, the functions and organizational structures
of the ministry will be assessed to see if they meet these objectives. Third, the Functional Reviews will
evaluate the roles and responsibilities of the state in this sector and the scope for devolution to local
governments or outsourcing to the private sector. Finally, the Reviews will determine whether the
administrative structure of the ministry matches its objectives and functions. TheFunctional Reviews
will assess the organizational structure in the context of these functions, and the degree of duplication of
tasks and responsibilities at departments within and among the ministries.  They will identify
opportunities for restructuring and for privatization and decentralization of service delivery.
After completing the Functional Reviews, the ministries will draft corporate plans for reorganizing
each ministry to improve its efficiency, transparency, responsiveness to citizens, and quality of services.
These plans will examine opportunities for "rightsizing' the civil service (through adjusting staffing levels
to new public sector requirements), reorganizing the administrative structure to best meet objectives,
eliminating redundant departments or functions, improving coordination among ministries, and
outsourcing services to the private sector.
After examining opportunities for private sector participation, client surveys will be conducted to
increase awareness and improve responsiveness of government ministries to the citizens they serve.
Finally, performance contracts stating goals for efficiency and service quality will be drafted and
benchmarks for performance defined. A summary of mechanisms for enhancing the citizen orientation of
service delivery are summarized below.



- 80 -
ANNEX 2
Box 11.1: Mechanisms for Enhancing the Citizen Orientation of Service Delivery
*  Setting service standards (as part of performance agreements), based on consultation with users regarding what
aspects of service quality they most value
* Re-engineering service delivery, including administrative simplification
* Publicizing service standards (charters etc) so citizens are aware of their reasonable entitlements
. Ensuring that staff understand and accept these standards, and work towards them as part of the general
performance management system
. Measuring performance against standards, and taking corrective action as necessary
. Developing accessible complaint and redress mechanisms as part of achieving these standards
I. Improving Line Ministry Performance
Performance Budgeting
To provide the underpinning for a successful introduction of performance budgeting, the
Government's reform program will implement a hurdle approach on a pilot basis using separate Resource
Agreements between the Bureau of the Budget (BOB) and each pilot agency. The strategy of piloting the
modernization of Thai budgeting processes in a small number of relatively progressive agencies is a
compromise between pragmatic evolution of budget reforms over an extended period (such as the
Australian model) and revolutionary change across the whole of the public sector (such as the New
Zealand model). The former offers an unacceptably slow path of change in the Thai circumstances while
the latter involves major implementation problems in the Thai cultural context. The Ministries of
Education and Health have been chosen by BOB as pilot agencies.
Role of a Resource Agreement
The Resource Agreement will take the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed by
BOB and the pilot agency. The MOU will stipulate that the pilot agency will receive the benefits of
(specified) financial decontrol by BOB when (and only when) specified changes in its financial and
performance information systems have been introduced (the 'gap filling' concept). These include
financial control procedures acceptable to BOB and minimum standards of performance information
relating to the agency's programs.
Sequencing
MOUs have been signed following an assessment of the extent of gap filling required in the pilot
agency in regard to its management and performance systems. The actual timing of decontrol itself,
however, will depend on the time taken to complete the gap filling effort. This depends on the scale of
the changes required and the intensity of the effort. It is desirable for the line agencies chosen for the
pilot to have already developed their financial control and performance information systems and have a
positive attitude to change. This will maximize the chance of the pilots succeeding within a short time
frame, and Resource Agreements being quickly extended to a second round of line agencies.
Implementation Arrangements
A separate Implementation Team has been established for each pilot agency, to manage the gap
filling effort. Each Team is based in the BOB Analyst's Office responsible for the agency. A higher
level Coordinating Team located in the policy area of BOB assists and steers the Implementation Teams.



- 81 -
ANNEX 2
This arrangement is intended to maximize skill transfer to the operational areas in BOB, together with
their 'ownership' of the changes. This is essential given the role of BOB sector experts in the monitoring
of performance information following financial decontrol.
Devolve Non-Core Functions
Various means exist for a Ministry to commercialize or devolve services that lie outside of its key
functions. Options include transferring services to the private sector, through privatization or service
agreements, contracting out services through new partnership arrangements, devolving services to sub-
national governments, or transferring them to another organization (including APOs) or Ministry.
II. Ministry of Education Restructuring Plans
Issues in Education Reform
Support for education reform has been building for four years, culminating in legislation (the
Education Act) and action plans that if carried through will transform Thai education over the next
decade.  Much has been achieved in developing education in Thailand.  But to improve the
competitiveness of the economy, ensure equity in access and benefits, and to improve efficiency in the
use of public resources, much more remains to be done.
-  The need to expand secondary and tertiary education in ways that build economic competitiveness
and also equity of opportunity to benefit from growth is a central challenge to the reform of
education.
*  Quantitative expansion brings quality issues to the fore. Maintaining quality during rapid expansion
has been a challenge
*  While great strides have been taken toward ensuring equitable access to education across Thailand's
regions, educational resources - the most experienced teachers, computers, supplementary learning
resources -- are inequitably distributed.
-  Although public education has been well financed at 20-25 percent of national budgets for the past
decade, a highly centralized education system has contributed to both quality and equity gaps.
Implementation of Public Sector Reforms in Education
Driven by a new Education Act and two years of consultation and preparation, public education
reforms will be launched to improve management, service quality and transparency. New (decentralized)
local education authorities will be created and granted power over curriculum, personnel and finance.
The central ministry will be restructured and downsized to reflect a shift from control to leadership and
support for a decentralized system. New performance, licensing and employment conditions will be
established for teachers. Independent quality assurance mechanisms will be established, and a strategic
program of stakeholder consultations and public communications will be established.
The education financing system would be radically changed to provide block grants to LEAs and to
schools, with amounts based on a standard per capita grant plus additional per capita grants based on
poverty and other equity issues, including provision for disadvantaged and handicapped students.
Schools within the LEA would be funded on the same basis. LEAs and schools would be empowered to
raise additional funds and to determine their use. Private schools would receive subsidies determined in
relation to the unit cost of education at different levels.



- 82 -
ANNEX 2
The reform process will be managed by an Education Reform Committee (ERC) which, under the
Education Act passed in August, 1999, will be established as an autonomous public organization with a
three year mandate to carry out the reforms required by the Act. The ERC will report to the Office of the
Prime Minister and be supported by an Education Reform Office whose staff will be drawn primarily
from the present Office of the National Education Commission. A counterpart Education Reform Office
is being established in the Ministry of Education.
Key reform objectives include: (i) improvement in management effectiveness and efficiency, (ii)
improvement in the quality of education services, and (iii) increased transparency and civic participation:
Improve management effectiveness and efficiency
*  Restructure and downsize the Ministry of Education
*  Decentralize authority to Local Education Agencies (LEAS) and schools
*  Reform conditions of teacher certification and employment
Improve the quality of education services
-  Establish independent quality assurance function
*  Develop and implement improved models of classroom instruction
*  Reform secondary education based on a new Vocational Education Law
*  Expand and improve the use of education technology
Increase transparency and civic participation
*  Public communication

III. Ministry of Public Health Restructuring Plans
Key Issues for Health Sector Reform
Over the last 30 years, Thailand has achieved remarkable progress in health improvements due
largely to the efforts of the public sector. Most health indicators have improved dramatically. Public
health care services reach virtually all communities through an extensive primary health care and
secondary health care system. The public sector runs 790 hospitals and 9,222 health centers. Seventy
five percent of hospital beds are in the public sector. The public sector finances about 52 percent of the
total health expenditures in Thailand, representing about 2.5 percent of GNP'. Sixty percent of these
public expenditures go directly to public facilities through the provision of line budgets for salaries,
equipment, other investments and specific funds for public health programs. The remaining 40 percent is
channeled to health care facilities through various health insurance schemes that together cover about 74
percent of the population for curative services. Two health insurance schemes are fully government
funded: (i) the Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) (6.6 million people, 11 percent of the
total population), and (ii) the Public Assistance Scheme (27 million people, 45 percent of the total
population). Three other schemes receive public funding (Social Security, Workmen Compensation
Scheme and Health Card). Public health programs (family planning, EPI etc ) are generally provided free
to all.
The present health system faces several challenges. The epidemiological transition creates new
needs.  Inequities in health outcomes still prevail.  Political changes exemplified by the new
Constitution support the decentralization of health services, greater accountability and transparency of
govemment services as well as greater civil society involvement. Improvements in the educational
status and urbanization of the population lead to expectations for equitable access and high-quality
services. Finally, the economic crisis reduced available financing for the health sector, and increased
the need for improved allocative efficiency.
Key problems in the present provision and financing of health services include the following:
*  Allocation of funding to provinces is not related to any assessment of needs or economic
vulnerability. The average subsidy of the MOPH is about Bt600 per capita. Few provinces have a
Gross Provincial Product (GPP) above Bt50,000. Yet, these provinces receive roughly the same level
of subsidy as other provinces with lower GPP. Rather than allocating funding to provinces based on
health needs, funds are often allocated based on the number and level of activities of public facilities.
*  Provinces lack autonomyfor local needs-based budgeting. Provinces receive their funding for health
as input-based subsidies from the line budgets of various departments of the MOPH and other
ministries. Provinces lack flexibility to reallocate these budgets according to their own needs and
objectives.
*  Payments to providers are not standardized and provide few incentives for better services. Each
insurance scheme has its own mode of payment and level of subsidy. Most are insufficiently linked
to performance. Payments are mainly linked to the level of activity of health facilities and cost
estimate of inputs consumed. The present schemes offer different levels of benefits and use different
mechanisms to pay providers. The poor (LIHC) and the near-poor (VHC) receive the lowest subsidy.
Songkla M.N et al "Equity in health and health care in Thailand", Nonthaburi, HSRI, pp.44
2 Between 1997 and 1998 the budget of the MOPH was cut by 9.4 billion bahts -or 14% . The investment expenses dropped from 39.4% in 1997.
To 26.9% in 1998 and about 16% in 1999.



- 85 -
ANNEX 2
On a per capita basis, private-sector employees receive three times more than the poor in government
subsidies.
* Payments to health facilities are fragmented and hospitals have insufficient management autonomy to
reallocate between line budgets. Hospitals must manage several budgets, each with different sets of
regulations.  The Ministry of Public Health provides ex-ante control but there is no regular
monitoring of performance in terms of quality, efficiency and equity.
*  Insufficient social accountability weakens incentives for better performance by public providers.
Civil society involvement in health is still very limited, and the knowledge in-balance between health
providers and users remain high. As a consequence, the health sector remains highly supply driven.
*  Quality assurance mechanisms are not harmonized and vary between facilities and according to
insurance schemes. No standards of quality are used as a basis for payments to public health
facilities.
*  Health facilities lack integrated performance assessment and accounting frameworkl systems that
would allow more efficient and transparent use of resources. All facilities have accounting systems
to follow up on the expenses conducted on their line budgets and internal revenue. Yet the
accounting is conducted on a cash basis. They lack accounting capacity to measure unit costs of
services, and relate performance to cost and financing.
Ongoing Reforms
Since 1997, health care reform efforts have promoted the adaptation of the health system to crisis
conditions. A "Good Health at Low Cost" plan has been designed. For several years now, efforts to
reform the health sector have been undertaken with the goals of: (i) improving the quality of care with
increased emphasis on primary care and health promotion and the development of a minimum care
package guaranteed to all; (ii) increasing the efficiency of services with revision of provider payment
mechanisms and harmonization of the various insurance schemes; and (iii) improving the equity of health
services, by equalizing subsidies on the basis of needs and income.
Health care reforms are presently undertaken by the MOPH through a three-pronged approach:
(i) support for analysis and operations research by the Health Services Research Institute which has been
conducting studies on various aspects of providing and financing health services; (ii) technical
development and field testing of key strategies in 6 provinces covered by the Health Care Reform Project
supported by the EU, and (iii) policy development and field testing of strategies in 7 provincial hospitals
through the Health Financing and Management Study Project supported by the ADB.
Health care reform strategies have been developed and field-tested to address these issues.
Block grants to provinces, equalized on the basis of objective criteria related to standardized
health needs will be used in the future. These block grants will be managed through provincial
purchasing agencies and Provincial Health Boards. The Provincial Health Office will become a purchaser
of health care, with sufficient autonomy to use its budget according to locally identified priorities and
program objectives negotiated with the MOPH. The low-income cards are already allocated on the basis
of provincial poverty assessment. And some provinces are currently experimenting with the merger of
CMBS, LIC and HC funds.
Performance-based budgeting for provider payment aims to change the present system of
payment to providers from activity-based and infrastructure-centered budgeting towards performance-
based budgeting. Pricing of government subsidies and co-payments will be harmonized on the basis of



- 86 -
ANNEX 2
analysis of actual costs. Methods such as Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) and capitation payments
have been developed and are being tested in about 10 provinces.
Quality assurance is a key reform element promoted within the Thai Health Care System.
Different types of quality assurance mechanisms have been put in place in many facilities. A hospital
accreditation program has developed quality standards for public facilities.
Civil society involvement in management boards of facilities aims to increase client control by
using and managing health resources at the facility level. Hospital governing boards involving clients
will be established.as part of the existing autonomous hospital project. Boards already exist in the private
sector and can provide examples. In some projects, management committees have been functioning for
some years with client involvement.
Information and financial management systems to facilitate the transparent and decentralized
monitoring of performance, expenditures, costs and financing flows will be standardized. This implies
developing accounting standards, auditing procedures and tools to identify management gaps and priority
needs. The development of such tools is presently seen as part of the autonomous hospital project.
Implementation of Public Sector Reform in the MOPH
The PSRP will support fundamental structural changes that will facilitate and accelerate the
implementation of health reforms. In the MOPH the process of change will focus on:
* Preparing provinces for the system of block-granting and deconcentration of budgetary authority by
developing provincial planning and managerial capacity by (i) developing frameworks for
consolidated analysis of the provincial health budgets that detail comprehensive sources and use of
funds in pilot provinces, (ii) testing the framework in pilot provinces and consequently reviewing the
methodology, (iii) expanding the -process of provincial budget assessment to all provinces, (iv)
establishing provincial health boards to allocate sector-wide provincial health budgets, and (v)
developing new allocation methodologies to provide block funding from the MOPH to the provinces
on the basis of need assessment. (Thai Resource Allocation Working Party)
* Developing the standards for performance-based provider payments by (i) adopting a policy of
performance-oriented provider payment based on standard unit costs (using specific unit categories
for case-mix e.g. DRGs,) in all public sector facilities, (ii) establishing a National Health Care
Financing Committee responsible for developing harmonized benefit packages, standardized unit
costs and payment mechanisms across different schemes iii) adopting a first draft a National Health
Insurance Act iii) developing guidelines for performance based payment based on standardized unit
costs (iii) implementing these provider payment norms across all government subsidized insurance
schemes.
* Implementing civil society participation in the management of health facilities by (i) adopting a
policy supporting the participation of civil society representatives in hospital management boards, (ii)
establishing civil society representation in the boards of all provincial and regional hospitals, (iii) and
establishing civil society representation in all Provincial Health Boards.
* Reinforcing quality assurance efforts by institutionalizing hospital accreditation by (i) adopting a
policy committing to the universal adoption of (public and private) hospital accreditation, (ii)
establishing the National Hospital Accreditation Institute under the 1999 Public Organization Act(iii)
using those accreditation criteria as one of the conditions for public sector payments in all (public and
private) hospitals of the country.



- 87 -
ANNEX 2
*  Developing the capacity of health facilities to assess and monitor performance costs and conduct
proper financial accounting by (i) developing a standard framework for facility-based assessment of
performance, cost accounting and financial accounting, (ii) developing independent auditing
procedures and standards, and (iii) testing the framework and standards in pilot hospitals.
*  Developing management autonomy of health facilities by (i) developing a process of autonomous
budget planning in provincial and regional hospitals, (ii) broad-banding line items budgets in one
single block grant to provincial and regional hospitals, and (iii) developing a framework for
performance assessment and monitoring
The MOPH has established a coordinating technical committee to guide the process of health
reform. The Bureau of Health Policy and Planning will act as secretariat of this committee. A
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed by the MOPH and BOB. The MOU stipulates
that the MOPH will receive the benefits of block-granting the budget for provincial and regional hospitals
by BOB when specific "gaps" in the financial and performance information systems have been
introduced in the public health system.
The MOPH has identified five domains, which represent implementation "gaps" towards effective
public sector reform and need to be addressed for successful broad-banding. For each of these domains
the MOPH has developed an implementation plan , including specific studies, constitution of task teams
and requests for specific technical assistance. The "gap" domains are:
-  Development of the Thai Resource Allocation Working Party: the MOPH requires the assistance of
experts with practical experience in developing a Resource Allocation Working Party to develop an
approach adapted to the Thai context.
*  Performance Assessment: The Thai MOPH needs expertise in monitoring and evaluation to review
the performance indicators developed for provinces (needs and outcomes mainly) and for health
facilities (outputs including case-mix, utilization, continuity, quality, equity, efficiency).
*  Performance Based Payment: case-mix is one of the key performance measure to be used for
calculating the global prospective budget to be given to hospitals, using Diagnosis Related Groups
(DRGs). Yet the reliability and validity of case-mix measures in the present management system
needs to be improved. Experts in DRGs are needed to help refine the existing information system,
particularly regarding the coding of diseases.
*  Financial Accounting. financial accounting expertise is needed to help the MOPH devise a new
accounting system for regional and provincial hospitals based on the analysis of the weaknesses of the
present system. (e.g.: moving from cash to accrual accounting).
*  Cost Accounting: expertise in costing of health services needs to be reinforced to develop a system of
cost accounting integrated with the newly established financial accounting system, allowing to
measure the unit cost of services provided by the health facilities.

IV. Ministry of Commerce Restructuring Plans
The OCSC is responsible for planning the restructuring of 14 ministries. It will focus on the
"economic ministries" (including the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Agriculture, and Ministry of Industry) first. These ministries will undertake restructuring in three phases
of roughly one year's duration each. The first phase of restructuring will focus on reviewing internal
functions (within each ministry) and defining core and non-core areas. The second phase will reassign
functions within the government sphere, by transferring some responsibilities between ministries and
government agencies. The third phase will reassign functions among all potential executing bodies
including ministries, Autonomous Public Organizations (APOs), SOEs, local governments, NGOs and
private (and privatized) entities. In addition to reassigning functions, the reorganization plans encompass
implications for budget, personnel, legal and ministry culture and values. This restructuring program is
elaborated in a paper prepared by the Administrative Renewal Project at OCSC and approved by cabinet
in April 1999.
The MOC plays several important roles that affect the business environment. They are
responsible for international trade policy and trade agreements, export promotion, competition policy
(mergers, abuse of dominance, price fixing, consumer protection etc.), import regulation, registration of
commercial businesses, collection of corporate records (financial statements, board decisions, etc.),
intellectual property and registration of patents, and supervision of certain businesses including insurance,
public warehouses, and oil reserves. The Ministry is much smaller in terms of staff and budget than
ministries that provide services such as health and education. However its impact on business is
important. For instance it allocates export quotas, sets rice quality standards, launches unfair trading
practices suits, it negotiates international trade agreements, organizes trade fairs, administers price
controls, and collects extensive firm data.
These functions are similar to those conducted by similar organizations such as the Department of
Commerce in the U.S. However, there are some important differences from standard international
practice both in terms of the scope of MOC activities and particularly in the operational manner in which
they are conducted. In recognition of this and in an effort to respond to changes in the global
environment the MOC has been preparing a restructuring program.
Key Issues for MOC Restructuring
Develop analytical capacity for formulation of trade policy and negotiation of trade
agreements. Thailand has long maintained a development strategy based on export growth and a
generally open trade regime. However, the last 20 years have seen the emergence of global markets, and
Thailand has made steady progress in moving from primary and agricultural exports towards
manufactured and higher value added products, many of which are incorporated in final goods assembled
in other countries. Adding to the complexity of trade relations is the fact that important trading blocks are
being formed as a result of regional agreements. These developments make it critically important that the
MOC deepen its analytical capacity so that it is able to fornulate appropriate trade policy and negotiate
effectively with its trading partners.
Enhance ability to provide basic information to support domestic producers and exporters and
devolve specialized promotionalfunctions to independent and private bodies. It is firms, not countries

To 26.9% in 1998 and about 16% in 1999.

ANNEX 2
that compete. But as in other countries, Thai firms depend on certain support facilities that are operated
through international networks of MOC offices, and they rely on information collected through these
offices. The effectiveness of these operations must be improved. However, beyond the provision of basic
information to buyers and suppliers, the MOC needs to cede the marketing and promotion functions to
independent and private bodies.
Strengthen institutional capacity for administration of competition policy. The responsibility
for competition policy resides with in the MOC. A new act has been passed which is in broad conformity
with international standards. The existing authority has been passive in administration of the old
competition law and has largely confined itself to issues of price regulation. It will need significant
training and institutional development work to be able to effectively administer the new act.
Rationalize regulatory functions. The MOC currently oversees a wide range of regulatory
functions, ranging from regulation of the insurance industry to price regulation in the rice trade. Some of
the functions should be devolved to private self-regulatory bodies, some should be covered by other
ministries and some may no longer be necessary. A rationalization and repositioning of these operations
is needed.
Improve IT and business services. The MOC intends to utilize its regional offices more
effectively in delivering business services. This will require upgrading of service standards in the regions
and will mean improving the IT facilities in the regional offices. In addition the MOC collects a large
amount of data from the private sector. It collects registration data from firms in the service sector and it
collects financial data and corporate records from all firms. These data are important for a broad range of
purposes from construction of the national accounts and creditworthiness checks. The information is
important to government policy makers as well as private businesses and steps must be taken to ensure
that this information is available and effectively used for decision-making and analysis by both business
and other branches of government.
Current Restructuring Plans
Organizational restructuring. The MOC is further advanced in formulating its reorganization
plans than other Ministries, and therefore provides opportunities for sharing experience with other
ministries as they move forward with the restructuring exercise. The Ministry has completed aFunctional
Review which was approved by Cabinet. This Functional Review was formulated with a view to
positioning Thailand as one of the five major intemational traders of Asia through free and fair
competition and effective cooperation with the business community. It outlines the core functions that
should remain within the MOC and those which are to be devolved to other bodies. There is to be a three-
stage process in which the functions are first reorganized within MOC. The second stage will see the
reassignment of some functions to other ministries. The final stage will involve shifting responsibilities
between the MOC and other private and quasi-public groups. Eight decrees needed to undertake the
internal restructuring will be effective from 1 October 1999 to coincide with the start of the fiscal year,
although a number of the changes have already been made de facto. Reforms in the second and third
stages will use the provisions of the recently passed Law onAutonomous Public Organizations (APOs).
In particular, the regulatory and business promotional functions will be devolved to APOs, while the
analytical, policy formulation and IT capacities within the MOC are enhanced. The activities of the
Department of Export Promotion (DEP) are furthest advanced. DEP will become an APO, and it is
expected that TDRI will do the legal and transition design work for MOC for implementation of the DEP
portion of the restructuring program.  Significant training and program  design activities will be
undertaken to launch this APO. Operational guidelines, staffing, work programs, budget and other
matters will settled before launching this APO in 2000. This is likely to be one of the first APOs
launched under the PSRL and will be an important pilot.

ANNEX 2
Revision of laws that define ministerial responsibilities and authorities. The realignment of
responsibilities as and in particular the revamping of regulatory functions will require revision of over 43
existing laws.
Manpower development. The restructuring plans envisage substantial investment in manpower
development. This affects all MOC operations but will be particularly important in the IT area and for
improving analytical skills in trade and competition policy.
IT development. The IT development plans will incorporate improve electronic systems and
support for better processing and dissemination of data. The IT improvements will underpin an effort to
standardize the provision of services through the network of regional business service centers and will
help to shorten the time for such functions as business registration and copyright and corporate name
searches.
V. Restructuring in Other Ministries
Three other ministries (MOF, MOA and MOI) will produce functional reviews with the
assistance of OCSC over the next few months. These will follow much the same pattern as the recently
completed review for the MOC. They will include a three-phase program with emphasis on internal
reorganization in the first phase and devolution to other ministries and to non-ministerial bodies in the
second and third phases.
