Introduction
In Thailand's history, 1997 will be a watershed year, both because of the economic crisis
and the passage of the new Constitution. The economic crisis highlighted the need for broad-
based, public-sector reforms, and the Constitution mandated a new role for the state. Both of
these developments created a window of opportunity for public sector reform.
The sudden end of the economic boom severely strained the Government's ability to
manage its economic and financial affairs and its ability to deliver public services. The
combination of recession-induced lower revenues, rising expenditures to meet the social needs of
the crisis, and the public costs of restructuring the financial system created large fiscal deficits
that required significant external financing. Public debt as a share of GDP more than doubled.
Thailand's highly developed "tiger" economy stood in stark contrast to its antiquated
administrative apparatus.' Many public institutions had not changed materially from their
establishment.2 Unstable coalition governments and limited coordination among public agencies
weakened the Government's ability to formulate and implement its policies. Frequent complaints
about corruption eroded the Thais' confidence in the public administration. Public officials and
citizens alike realized that substantial changes were required both to overcome the crisis and to
prepare the public administration to manage in a global environment.
The new Constitution was drafted in a highly participatory manner, and provides for
increased citizen participation, enhanced transparency and accountability, and decentralization. It
mandated the establishment of accountability institutions such as the Administrative Courts,
Office of the Ombudsman, and National Counter Corruption Commission, and promulgated new
standards for transparency and guidelines for decentralizing authority and resources to local
administrations.
In response to these pressures, the Thai Government launched an ambitious program to
reform the public sector. In May 1999, the Cabinet issued its Public Sector Management Reform
Plan (PSMRP) which provided its vision for institutional change over the medium-term. A high-
level, Public Sector Reform Committee was tasked with overseeing the reforms. The Public
Sector Reform Loan (PSRL) provided critical support to the Government's reform program.
1 The last comprehensive reform of the public sector occurred in 1892.
2 For example, the civil service was established in 1928 and the Bureau of the Budget was established in 1951.

3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Thailand's Public Sector Management Reform Program (PSMRP) seeks to improve public
sector governance in central agencies and line ministries, and to enhance the efficiency,
effectiveness, equity, and transparency of public resource management and service delivery. The
program has three main objectives:



*     Enhance resource management by creating incentives for finance, budget, revenue and
civil service agencies to improve performance, and by focusing on outcomes in managing financial
and human resources.
*     Improve service delivery by restructuring the way the central Government delivers
services and, for selected line ministries, by outsourcing, restructuring, or decentralizing
goverrnent activities and enhancing public sector responsiveness to communities.
*     Strengthen accountability and transparency and restore confidence in government by
strengthening accountability institutions, improving transparency in budgeting, refocusing the civil
service toward client service, and establishing effective mechanisms to promote accountability and
transparency.
The PSRL was envisioned as critical support to launch a multi-year program of reforms
that would achieve these objectives. The program design recognized that institutional reforms
occur over several years at an uneven pace. Hence the project did not anticipate that the
objectives listed above would be fully achieved during the course of the PSRL.
3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions were made to the above-mentioned objectives.
3.3 Original Components:
Single Tranche:     $400,000,000
Thailand's public sector reform objectives are implemented through specific action plans,
which define implementation benchmarks in: (i) expenditure management; (ii) human resource
management; (iii) revenue administration; (iv) decentralization; and (v) cross-government
accountability and transparency.
*     Expenditure management reforms are designed to: (i) link Thailand's planning, sector
policy making and budgeting processes; (ii) measure outputs and outcomes instead of controlling
inputs; (iii) improve the quality of fiscal adjustment; and (iv) improve financial transparency.
*     Human resource management reforms are intended to: (i) modernize the role,
organization, and processes of key line ministries to enhance their service delivery; (ii) introduce
performance-based human resource management systems for the civil service; and (iii) strengthen
the caliber of cross-government, senior staff by developing a Senior Executive Service.
*     Revenue administration reforms are designed to: (i) ensure adequate and sustainable
revenue; (ii) improve revenue collection, widen the tax base, and achieve a more equitable
distribution of the tax burden; and (iii) strengthen the managerial capacity of the Revenue
Department to perform its functions efficiently and effectively on a sustainable and transparent
basis.
*     Decentralization reforms are intended to: (i) increase the share of local government
expenditures; (ii) assign more revenue sources to local governments; (iii) revise the system of
intergovernmental transfers to provide grants in a more transparent and predictable way; (iv)
promote mechanisms for local accountability; and (v) build local government capacity.
*     Cross government accountability and transparency reforms are designed to: (i)
strengthen accountability institutions; (ii) improve access to, and use of, public information by
individual citizens and civil society, including improving responsiveness by Government in
- 2 -



providing this access; (iii) increase probity among civil servants; and (iv) enhance civil society
participation in improving transparency.
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at Entry is assessed as Satisfactory. The project's objectives were clear and
realistic, and the design was appropriate and based on extensive consultation and technical
assistance. The project concept was built in part on work initiated under the Economic
Management Assistance Loan, which provided technical assistance to improve the Government's
capacity to manage Thailand's economy. Taking advantage of its presence in the field, the Bank
team provided intensive policy dialogue, technical assistance and knowledge sharing throughout
the preparation of the project.
The PSRL was explicitly envisioned in the 1998 CAS, which focused on: (i) renewed
competitiveness of Thailand's productive capacity, financial sector, and labor force; (ii) better
governance of public and private institutions; and (iii) more equitable distribution of the benefits
of growth across social lines.
The risks associated with the project were manageable. The overall approach of designing
a comprehensive reform, using incentives to improve performance, and promoting demand for
reform beyond central agencies was developed based on international experience, and with the
advice of leading experts who had implemented similar public sector reforms in other countries
(e.g., New Zealand, Australia, etc.)
QAG did not assess Quality at Entry.
Quality of the Design:
The overall design of the reform program integrates international experience with Thai
circumstances. It provides an integrated framework for reforming the core public management
systems (i.e., public expenditure management, human resource management, and revenue
mobilization). Importantly, these core reforms were designed to create strong incentives for
cooperation (e.g., greater autonomy and flexibility) among the agencies participating in the
reforms. Perhaps the clearest illustration of this is the "hurdle" approach to the public expenditure
management reform which gives line agencies freedom to manage more effectively while also
holding them accountable for producing better results. The "hurdle" approach grants flexibility in
expenditure management to line agencies once they prove that they have core competencies (i.e.,
meet "hurdle standards") in seven aspects of financial and performance management.
Ministry-specific reforms were targeted to a limited number of pilot ministries and
agencies at the outset of the reform process, with expansion of pilots over time. This sequencing
recognizes the importance of concentrating limited human and financial resources on a few,
vertical reform efforts during the initial stages, as well as promoting learning from experience. The
project design includes measures aimed at enhancing accountability and transparency by
strengthening independent organizations (e.g., the National Counter Corruption Commission, the
- 3 -



Administrative Courts) and taking steps to ensure consultations with civil society.
The PSRL was the first Programmatic Structural Adjustment Loan (PSAL) to be
approved by the Board, hence there was no previous experience to draw upon. It's
appropriateness to support the institutional reforms envisioned by the PSRL was based on its
program structure, flexibility, and potential for sustained engagement. Reforming public
institutions typically requires coordinated leadership across several complementary and mutually
reinforcing areas, which are best managed as a reform program. Successful implementation also
requires incremental improvements that take advantage of rapidly opening and closing political
and bureaucratic windows of opportunity. The PSRL included defined but flexible benchmarks
that can be adjusted as necessary to accommodate the pace of implementation of Thailand's
PSMRP. Finally, the PSAL structure can help sustain the momentum for reforms, and provide a
platform for structured dialogue on implementation progress.
Memorandum of the President (MOP) Risk Assessment (1999)
The MOP identified three major risks at project entry, which were manageable. First,
although civil society demand for public sector reform was strong, it was not necessarily well
articulated. Civil society organizations have been engaged in monitoring and providing policy
advice on the reform through public announcements, an awareness campaign, and oversight from
distinguished citizens, community-based organizations and think tanks.
Second was the risk that project implementation could suffer if coordination among
agencies were blocked by turf fights or lengthy, consensus-oriented decision making. To enhance
coordination and monitoring, and to provide day-to-day support to the reform program, the
Government appointed a Project Management Office (PMO) that reports to the PSRC. The PMO
plays a critical role in managing the day-to-day aspects of the reform for the Governmnent: drafting
policy papers; monitoring progress and disseminating results; identifying specific reform activities
to be funded by $100 million of the PSRL proceeds that were allocated for the reform; integrating
reform activities across components; and coordinating efforts across agencies. In contrast to other
Bank-funded Project Implementation Units, the PMO was established by the Government to
support its reform needs rather that the Bank's project needs. Through regular workshops and
sustained dialogue the Bank also played a significant role in breaking down established "turf'
divisions and promoting coordination across agencies.
Third, political commnitment to reform risked being weakened due to political resistance to
institutional reform or a change in administration. Sustained support for public sector reform is
reflected both in the 9th Plan, which notes improved governance as a key element of Thailand's
development agenda from 2002 through 2007, and the new Government's support for the reforn
program. It has specified an action plan for public sector reform, and expects to implement a
substantial re-engineering of the public administration by October 2002 (the beginning of FY03.).
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
PSRL's outcomes have been Satisfactory. The project achieved its major objective of
launching a comprehensive reform process and is expected to achieve relevant development
results without significant shortcomings. It mobilized $400 million in budgetary support for the
-4 -



Government, that contributed to its efforts to stimulate the economy during the financial crisis. All
Board conditions were fulfilled before the PSRL was declared effective in February 2000, and
significant progress has been achieved in the program benchmarks.
Major achievement include: widespread acceptance of the need for public sector reform;
political commitment to solve it; leadership from the top of the bureaucracy to empower change
agents below; a vision of the reform's outcomes and plan to achieve them; and efforts to build
awareness of the reform among participants and stakeholders. Outputs by program component
are summarized below and described in greater detail in Annex 10 (which presents the original
PSRL Implementation Benchmarks and assesses progress achieved).  Because the project
emphasized laying the foundation for a steady and strategic program of reforms over a multi-year
period, few of the outputs noted have measurable impacts.
4.2 Outputs by componenits:
(i) Expenditure Management
*     Signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) between BOB and MOE, as well as BOB
and MOPH to govern their reforn programs
*     Developed the "hurdle approach" to implement performance budgeting reforms and began
granting pilot agencies greater budget flexibility

reduction of about 42,000 employees
a     Cabinet approved a Senior Executive Service proposal and an initial cadre of eligible
candidates was identified
*     Introduced lateral recruitment measures, variable performance pay, and redundancy
provisions
(iii) Revenue Management

*     Established, staffed and funded the accountability institutions mandated in the Constitution
(e.g., National Counter Corruption Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman, the
Administrative Courts, etc.)
*     Conducted corruption perception surveys among households, business enterprises and
government employees as inputs to develop an Anti-Corruption Strategy; developed and
implemented anti-corruption awareness campaign
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Not applicable.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional Development Impact is assessed as Substantial. The PSRL has contributed
significantly to Thailand's institutional capability to use its financial and human resources more
effectively, to strengthen service delivery, and to promote accountability and transparency. New
institutions like the Large Taxpayer's Office, Senior Executive Service, Office of the National
Decentralization Committee, National Counter-Corruption Commission, Office of the
Ombudsman, and Administrative Courts have been created, and strategic plans for their operation
have been developed. Over time, these institutions will change the way in which the Government
provides, finances and monitors public service delivery. In addition, incentives to sustain reform
are being put in place; laws and regulations that constitute the enabling environment for reform
are being drafted and implemented; and the systems that govern organizations and their
interactions are being reformed.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The unanticipated shocks associated with the economic and financial crisis diverted the
attention of some government officials, which in turn delayed the achievement of some PSRL
benchmarks. As the effects of the crisis abated, significant effort was devoted to the reform and
progress was achieved.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
In accordance with project conditionality, Thailand maintained a sound macroeconomic
framework during the period of the PSRL.
The Government chose to withdraw the PSRL proceeds in two installments ($200 million
in July 2000, and the remaining $196 million in July 2001), despite the facts that the loan was a
single-tranche operation, and that all conditions of effectiveness were met in February 2000. The
Government wanted flexibility in matching PSRL withdrawals with its needs for budgetary
support.
Political unwillingness to provide funding during the crisis slowed the pace of some reform
tasks. Because Thailand's FY00 Budget did not allocate resources to the reform (and was itself
- 6 -



sharply reduced in response to the crisis), some tasks were delayed (e.g., implementation of the
accounting and financial management system for BOB reform pilots). These delays were
subsequently overcome, by the inclusion of reforin costs in the FY0 1 budget and Cabinet approval
of $100 million of the PSRL proceeds to finance reform tasks.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
From the outset, the reform process was managed by a series of committees, which is
common in Thailand. These committees met infrequently and had other responsibilities. As a
result, cross-cutting issues and broad policy frameworks were not fully addressed. In contrast,
counterparts from central agencies (e.g., OCSC, BOB, MOF, RD, NESDB) maintained a
consistent focus on the PSRL, and provided a high-quality team, throughout the project period. In
addition, good cooperation was received from line ministries and independent organizations,
whose assistance was important to project success within their reform areas.
In summary, the outcome is assessed as Satisfactory, with all relevant development
objectives achieved, and no significant shortcomings. A major achievement of the project was in
establishing a comprehensive approach and in generating momentum for reform. Half of the
respondents surveyed as part of the Intensive ICR workshop felt that the program would have
strong or very strong impacts on establishing incentives for better performance.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
There were no cost changes.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Sustainability of the Government's reform is assessed as Likely. Government commitment
is codified in the Cabinet resolution and has been maintained across changes in administration and
among numerous agencies. The reform is well designed and resourced; as noted earlier, the
Cabinet dedicated $100 million of the PSRL proceeds to finance reform tasks. A structure to
manage the reform process is in place, and many senior officials have become pro-active agents of
change. Competition among reform agencies has sustained reform momentum, and new agencies
have expressed interest in participating as pilots in the reform program.
Promoting demand for well-defined results from key stakeholders has not been fully
achieved, and could affect sustainability over time. Two areas meriting improvement in
monitoring reform progress are: (i) overcoming the tendency to focus on reform actions rather
than impacts; and (ii) inadequate attention to assuring that the impacts that potential stakeholders
care most about are actually monitored. Initial efforts to promote external demand for reform
through regular monitoring by civil society and the media, and strengthening the Parliament in its
watchdog role, should be enhanced. To date, much of the monitoring and evaluation has been
performed by the World Bank, although the PMO is now playing a key role. Enhanced monitoring
can help to build and reinforce commitment to real improvements in service delivery on the
ground and can provide the basis for further institutional learning.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
The Government is continuing, and in some ways accelerating, its public sector reforms.
7 -



At present, it's needs for external financing are limited and it is unlikely that the Government
would request Bank financing for PSRL-II. The Bank will help mobilize grant funds through the
Country Development Partnership in Governance, which focuses on technical assistance and
capacity building in support of the reform program.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Lending is assessed as Satisfactory. The PSRL was prepared almost entirely in the field,
and built from extensive technical assistance provided as part of the Economic Management
Assistance Loan. For example, the Government prepared its first Public Expenditure Review,
which provided a diagnostic of needed reforms in expenditure management, as part of this
technical assistance. Cooperation and coordination with donors was very strong, (especially with
AUSAID, ADB and NZODA) and donor support was provided in complementary ways.
Extensive effort was devoted to managing relationships among many counterparts and
stakeholders: in building awareness of the need for change, identifying options for structuring the
reform design, and building capacity to implement those reforms.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision is assessed as Highly Satisfactory. The tenure of the PSRL was relatively
short, and supervision was correspondingly intensive. While the project was formally operational
for around 18 months (February 2000 - July 2001), three supervision missions were mounted
from headquarters, Resident Mission staff had frequent contact with project participants, and an
ICR workshop was held. The composition of missions was appropriate, PSRL team continuity
was excellent, and reporting was good. The missions provided detailed and systematic feedback
on project implementation and suggested how to address identified problems. The PSRL team
worked closely with the PMO and participating agencies to provide technical advice, as required,
and workshops were frequently held to share the lessons learned throughout the supervision
period.
The supervision budget ($35,000) for this task was insufficient to fund the extensive time
in the field that was required to monitor progress and support the ongoing reform. Additional
resources were leveraged via fimding for an intensive learning ICR, and developing the Country
Development Partnership in Governance.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Overall Bank performance is assessed as Satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Overall Borrower performance is considered Satisfactory. As noted earlier, the Borrower
drafted the strategy for public sector reform, and then refined the implementation plan in
consultation with the Bank.
7.5 Government implernentation performance:
Borrower commitment was strong, and its technical and practical contribution to the
- 8 -



project was considerable. The project team was excellent, and, as noted earlier, a sound
macroeconomic framework was maintained. Government implementation performance was
Satisfactory.
7.6 Inmplementing Agency:
Implementation of the reformns was steady, and officials worked hard at overcoming
obstacles. Performance of the implementing agencies was Satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall borrower performance is considered to be Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
*     The program structure of the PSAL was appropriate for Thailand, but leverage from
financing was limited. The program structure supported institutional reforms over the medium
term that were mandated by the new Constitution. The program structure assisted counterparts in
defining reform areas and sequencing activities over a three-year period; established regular
dialogue and monitoring; and emphasized flexibility and sustained momentum in managing the
reform. The Government's financing needs diminished as the economic recovery gained strength,
and the final, $196 million withdrawal of the PSRL occurred in July 2001. Besides providing
$400 million in budget support, the Bank's main contributions were in providing knowledge, and
monitoring and evaluating reform progress. Allocating the loan to budget support reinforced the
flexibility in managing the reform process. If the loan had been allocated in advance to specific
institutions, it would have been more difficult to reward those agencies that achieved progress,
which in turn promoted competition among agencies to reform.
*     The PSMRP Cabinet Paper established commitment to reform and defined its strategy; the
PSRL benchmnarks provided work plans for implementing the reform.
*     High-quality and intensive technical assistance was critically important in building
awareness, designing the reform program and supporting implementation. Many of the diagnostic
studies that were used in designing the reform were financed by the Economic Management
Assistance Loan. Without this preparatory work, the reform program would have been less
comprehensive and deep.
*     Coordination across reform  areas was a challenge, and was enhanced with the
establishment of the PMO, which provided full-time support to the reform process. The Bank
played an important role in building awareness of the need for coordinated and comprehensive
approaches to reform, and over time, was able to break down some of the narrow "silo"
approaches that historically characterized agency interactions.
*     The expected integration of sectoral reform plans in health, education and commerce (as
originally envisioned in the project design) within the overall public sector reform was overly
ambitious. In part, this was because the magnitude of changes needed in institutions, processes
and culture was not fullv -understood until the reform was underway. Once the proper incentives
for managing performance are implemented, sectoral reforms could be integrated more effectively
into the overall public sector reform.
*     Independent organizations (e.g., the Administrative Courts, the National Counter
Corruption Commission, etc.) play an important role in strengthening accountability and
transparency. As newly established organizations, they faced challenges in receiving adequate
resources from the executive branch. In designing the project's oversight structure (through the
-9-



executive branch vis a vis the Prime Minister's Office) the potential conflicts between independent
organizations and the executive were underestimated. The project might have considered defining
a role for the Parliament, which oversees the independent organizations, in supporting the
independent agencies in their reforms.
X     The Thais value the Bank's global knowledge, technical assistance and supervision;
subsequent stages of the reform will require enhanced monitoring and evaluation from the Thai
government and civil society.
*     A consistent project team  of Bank staff and technical counterparts, and dedicated
resources were necessary to develop and support the reform process. Government ownership was
strengthened through the strong personal relationships that were developed and sustained over
many years.
*     It is too soon to "declare victory" in public sector reform; however, a strong foundation
has been laid.

Annex 8. Beneficiary Survey Results
The PSRL ICR workshop was held on 25 April 2001 and was attended by over 40
government counterparts from various agencies, including the Bureau of the Budget, the
Comptroller-General's Department, the Office of the Civil Service Commission, the National
Economic and Social Development Board, the Revenue Department, the Office of the National
Decentralization Committee, the Ministry of Education, the Administrative Courts, the
Ombudsman, and the National Counter-Corruption Commission.
Following welcome remarks by the World Bank's Country Director for Thailand, Mr.
Jayasankar Shivakumar, the Task Manager for the PSRL, Dr. Dana Weist, gave an overview of
the Thai Public Sector Reform Program. Dr. Orapin Sopchokchai, Director of the Public Sector
Reform Project Management Office, summarized a survey of 68 public officials regarding the
reform program:
*     88 percent of respondents felt that the PSRL design was appropriate
*     92 percent of respondents felt that the potential impacts of the reform would be positive
*     75 percent of respondents felt that resources to accomplish reform objectives were
abundant
*     50 percent of respondents felt that the reform would strongly establish the proper
incentives
*     68 percent of respondents felt that the reform would strongly support institution building.
In sustaining the reform, several speakers emphasized the need for additional effort to
include more public participation; prioritize action in areas where there are frequent public
complaints; and maintain Government commitment and ownership, and talented reform drivers.
With regard to the role of the World Bank, workshop participants noted that the Bank's
support in providing global experience in designing and supporting the reform was very valuable;
that monitoring reform progress, and focusing the attention of the Government on critical issues
was important; and it is hoped that additional Bank cooperation and support for the reform will be
provided in the future.
