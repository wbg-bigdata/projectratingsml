HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3145-MA)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.    The Highway Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (Loan. 3145-MA, US$83.2
million) was the sixth and, most likely, the last Bank-financed operation in the transport
sector in Malaysia. The total cost of the six projects was RM932.6 million (about
US$379 million), of which the Bank financed US$242.3 million. The lending strategy
that the Bank used in designing the first five projects focused on the provision of
transport infrastructure in accordance with Government policy aimed at supporting the
productive sectors in West Malaysia and improving accessibility in East Malaysia.
Following the economic downturn of 1985-86, and the Government's fiscal constraints,
the Government and the Bank agreed that efforts be directed towards optimizing the use
of available capital and increasing the efficiency of transport operations. The Project was
initiated on this basis.
Project Objectives
2.    The objective of the Project was to assist the Government in preserving and
improving the federal highway network to meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand
safely and adequately. To this end, the Project was designed to improve: (a) road
maintenance capability and operations on the federal road network and, in the process, to
improve maintenance planning, programming and management, and to enhance the cost-
effectiveness and timeliness of maintenance operations; (b) coordination of highway
planning at the state and federal levels; (c) existing network of national highways; (d)
truck-weight control to reduce damage to the roads; and (e) road safety.
3.    The Project's components were: (a) rehabilitation and strengthening of 562 km of
road; (b) replacement of 67 bridges; (c) construction of 35 weigh stations; (d)
improvement of two trunk highway of 56 km; (e) improvement of 42 hazardous road
sections; (f) construction of 27 pedestrian bridges; (g) computerization of road design; (h)
provision of consulting services for design and works supervision; (i) provision of
technical assistance to strengthen Government capability to plan, coordinate and
supervise road projects and to evaluate their environmental impact; and (j) provision of
training.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The Project objective has been largely achieved. All components were completed
without major problems except for the Maintenance Improvement Program component



- iii -
which was achieved partially (see para. 5). At appraisal in 1989, the Project's cost had
been estimated at US$239 million. At the end of 1993, the total Project cost was
estimated at US$304 million. The following year, at the Borrower's request, an
amendment to the Loan Agreement was approved in order to reduce the roads to be
rehabilitated. As a result, Project's cost was reduced by about 25%. Total cost of the
Project are now estimated at US$242 million. The Project was expected to be completed
in four years with design, preparation of bidding documents and land acquisition starting
in mid-1989. When the Loan was closed on June 30, 1996, one year later than originally
planned, works under some components were not yet finished, and the scope of the
Project was somewhat smaller.
5.    Most of the cost overruns and delays occurred under the Highway Rehloilitation
and Strengthening Program, a sub-component of the Maintenance Improvement Program.
Cost ovenruns originated for two main reasons. First, at Project appraisal, cost estimates
for this component were only based on "current unit rates" since pavement evaluation and
design, as well as detailed engineering, had not been done. Second, the boonling
economic situation of the country induced high inflation in civil works. Due to the cost
escalation, the Loan Agreement was amended in 1994 in order to reduce the total length
of roads to be rehabilitated under this sub-component (from 526 km to 326 km). Delays
occurred mainly for two reasons. First, the Government deferred provision of the
necessary funds on the grounds that costs were higher than the appraisal estimates, hence
the allocations to the budget were no longer sufficient. Second, the implementing
agency, JKR, was beset by staff shortages and frequent changes due to the booming
economic situation and lower salaries paid in public sector. As a result of this very high
turnover of staff, the implementation of the Project slowed down.
6.   Improvement of Highway Maintenance Operations, the second sub-component of
the Maintenance Improvement Program, was not sufficiently monitored by either the
Bank or the Borrower.  It appears that neither party showed much interest and
determination in monitoring Loan covenants on road maintenance.  As a result,
evaluation of the sustainability of the Project in this area is rather difficult.
7.   In project identification, preparation and appraisal, the Bank performance can be
rated as satisfactory. However, the Bank was somewhat deficient in Project supervision.
Over the six and a half year duration of the Project, the Bank carried out only ten
supervision missions of which some were very short -- not quite enough for a large and
complex Project which encountered some problems. In addition, supervision reports do
not always cover the quality of works, procurement and other information adequately. In
addition, ratings were often too optimistic.
8.    The implementing agency's overall performance can be rated satisfactory.
However, its efficiency was affected by shortages and frequent changes of staff. The
Borrower's performance regarding compliance with Loan covenants has not been fully
satisfactory nor have measures of the Action Plans agreed upon with the Bank always
been taken. In particular, the Borrower did not provide funds for some programs as



- iv -
promptly as needed and did not take the necessary steps to (a) give JKR total authority
over its personnel, (b) reinforce JKR's district offices with qualified staff, and (c) make
HPU responsible for the coordination of investments in highways. These were important
steps required to improve the quality of construction supervision, maintenance operations
and highway planning.
9.    The Project is likely to be sustainable since: (a) the Government has increased its
allocation for routine and periodic maintenance of roads; (b) the Government is
committed to take the necessary steps to ensure the enforcement of axle load limits; and
(c) JKR is committed to the full development on the Pavement Management Systems.
Summary of Findings. Future Operation and Key Lessons Learned
10.   Despite failure by all parties to follow up on Loan covenants adequately, the
overall rating of the Project is satisfactory. The Project reinforced JKR's, the local
contractors' and the consultants' capability in the maintenance, rehabilitation and
strengthening of roads and therefore, achieved its objective to assist the Government in
preserving and improving the federal highway network. Also, the Project created safety
awareness, provided the tools to control overloading and to preserve the road network,
and helped develop road management systems.
11.   The Government has not shown much interest in borrowing from the Bank for
future infrastructure operations. Therefore, in line with Government interest, no future
Bank's operation is being considered in the transport sector.
12.   The main lessons to be drawn from project implementation are:
a) more supervision resources should be allocated for projects as large and
complex as this. It is not sufficient to carry out a good appraisal and provide
long-term action plans, introduce covenants and reach agreement with the
Borrower on many points during negotiations if follow-up during supervision
cannot be assumed, and in particular, if not supported by properly staffed
mission in the field; and
b) Cost estimates of major civil works components should be based on solid and
up-to-date feasibility studies and detailed designs prepared during project
preparation and appraisal.
13.   A lesson can also be drawn from the experience of carrying out this
Implementation Completion Report:
Proper evaluation of achievement of objectives and sustainability of highway
projects is difficult within six months after the closing of the loans. Much
information is not yet available, such as reliable data on traffic, maintenance
operations, and quality of works.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MALAYSIA
HIGHWAY REHABILITATION and IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3145-MA)
PART I: IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Background
1.    The Federation of Malaysia consists of 13 states with a land surface of about 337,000 km2 and a
population of about 19 million. It covers the southern part of the Malay Peninsula (West Malaysia) and
the eastern part of Borneo (East Malaysia), separated from West Malaysia by 650 km of the South China
Sea. West Malaysia consists of 1 1 states with an area of about 135,000 km2 and a population of about 15
million, whereas East Malaysia consists of 2 states with an area of about 202,000 km2 and a population
of about 4 million.
2.    During the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s Malaysia's economy grew rapidly making it
necessary to improve and extend the transport system. During the four five-year development plans
from 1966 to 1985, the Government made large investments (US$5.5 billion) in the transport
infrastructure. Some of these investments were somewhat premature, or were more costly than
estimated, but most of them supported economic growth.
3.    The transport system of Malaysia is well developed for the country's size and income level,
though it is not evenly balanced between West and East Malaysia. It consists oe some 60,700 km of
roads, of which about 45,300 km are paved roads and 15,400 km are unpaved roads, as well as 1,650
route-km of railway, 29 airports (four of which are for international traffic), 40 airstrips, and 61 ports.
4.    Prior to the Highway Rehabilitation and Improvement Project, the Bank financed five projects in
the highway sub-sector from 1972 through 1983: (i) Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project, Loan 851-
MA for US$16, (ii) Second Highway Project, Loan 931-MA for US$19.5 million, (iii) Second Kuala
Lumpur Urban Transport Project, Loan 1214-MA for US$26 million of which US$4 million was
canceled in 1982, (iv) Third Highway Project, Loan 1376-MA for US$35 million of which US$9.1
million was canceled in 1985, and (v) Sabah-Sarawak Road Project, Loan 2291-MA for US$86.2
million of which US$15 million was canceled in 1987 and US$ 0.7 million in 1992.
5.    Four projects recorded cost overruns ranging from about 6% to 30%, and all five projects
recorded long delays ranging from 16 to 72 months. Cost overruns were due to inflation, delays and
scarcity of materials. Delays were due to right-of-way acquisition and related problems of squatter
removal, relocation of utilities, unsatisfactory contractor perfornance (slow start-up of work due to
difficulties in obtaining equipment-import and work permits, lack of experience, personnel and
equipment as well as financial problems).
Road Statistics: 1995; other information are as old as 1983-1989.



2
6.    The lending strategy that the Bank used in designing these five projects focused mainly on the
provision of transport infrastructure in accordance with the Government's policy aimed at supporting the
productive sectors by reducing transport costs in West Malaysia and improving accessibility in East
Malaysia. Following the economic downturn of 1985-86, and the Government's fiscal constraints, the
Government and the Bank agreed that efforts had to be directed towards optimizing the use of available
capital and increasing the efficiency of transport operations.
7.   In 1987-88, the Bank, at the request of and in cooperation with the Government, carried out a
National Transport Policy Review. The Review identified five general areas where the Bank's support
could be beneficial. The first two areas concerned road transport (i.e., transport coordination and
planning, and road maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading). The Bank's approval of the Highway
Rehabilitation and Improvement Project reflected this orientation.
B. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
8.    Statement of Objectives - The objective of the Project was to assist the Government in preserving
and improving the federal highway network to meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand safely and
adequately. To this end, the Project was designed to improve: (a) road maintenance capability and
operations on the federal road network and, in the process, to improve maintenance planning,
programming and management, and to enhance the cost-effectiveness and timeliness of maintenance
operations; (b) coordination of highway planning at the state and federal levels; (c) existing network of
national highways; (d) truck-weight control to reduce damage to the roads; and (e) road safety.
9.    Evaluation of Objectives - The Project objective was an obvious departure from the strategy that
the Government and the Bank had used from 1972 to 1983 to design the previous five highway projects
(para. 6). The Project objectives were clearly defined, realistic and not particularly complex. They were
appropriately reflected in the design of the Project and in accordance with the priorities set out in the
Malaysia Fifth Development Plan for the highway sub-sector.
C. Achievement of Objectives
10.   The Project's components were:
a) Implementation of a Maintenance Improvement Program, including the rehabilitation
and strengthening of 562 km of road pavements and the improvement of maintenance
operations;
b) Replacement of 43 sub-standard bridges on primary roads and 24 timber bridges on
secondary roads of the federal highway system in Peninsular Malaysia;
c) Construction of 35 weigh stations under a Truck Weight Control Program;
d) Improvement of two trunk highway sections totaling about 56 km;



3
e) Improvement of 42 hazardous road sections and construction of 27 pedestrian bridges in
conjunction with a Road Safety Improvement Program;
f) Provision of computer hardware and software to improve JKR's Computer-Aided
Design and Drafting (CADD) capability;
g) Consulting services for design and construction supervision of (a), (b) and (d);
h) Technical assistance to: (i) strengthen the capability of the Highway Planning Unit
(HPU) to plan and coordinate road investments; (ii) strengthen JKR's capabilities in
supervising civil works contracts for both construction and maintenance, disseminating
a Pavement Management System, establishing a Bridge Management System and
improving JKR's maintenance training program; (iii) improve road safety monitoring
and analysis; (iv) establish methodologies for determining the environmental impact of
road works; and (v) improve JKR's CADD capabilities in the highway sector; and
i) Staff training in maintenance programming and operations, computerized design and
drafting, transport planning, and traffic engineering and road safety analysis.
11.   The Project objective and most of its components were substantially achieved.  Only the
Maintenance Improvement Program component encountered some problems and was achieved only
partially (Chapter D).
12.   Economic Evaluation. Based on JKR's calculations, which were carried out in accordance with a
recognized methodology, the IRRs for the various components were estimated as follows: (i) Road
Rehabilitation Strengthening Program which averages 25%; (ii) Replacement of Timber Bridges
Program which averages 40%; and (iii) Road Improvement Program which averages 29%. However, an
independent evaluation of the IRRs was not possible since separate economic and financial data, updated
VOC and maintenance cost were not available.
D. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
13.   The Project was beset with cost overruns and delays similar to those from the previous five
highway projects financed by the Bank (para. 5).  At appraisal, the Project total base cost had been
estimated at RM488 million (US$181 million) and the total cost, including contingencies, at RM645
million (US$239 million). At the end of 1993, the revised Project total cost was RM822 million
(US$304 million). Most of the cost overruns occurred under the Highway Rehabilitation and
Strengthening Program which was scaled down in order to contain costs. The newly revised Project
total cost was RM621 (US$242 million). Table 8A gives a summary of Project costs in U.S. dollars.
14.   At appraisal, the Project was expected to be completed in four years from 1990 to the end of
1993, with design, preparation of bidding documents and land acquisition starting in mid-1989.
However, when the Loan Agreement was closed on June 30, 1996, one year later than originally
planned, works under some components were not yet finished, and the scope of the Project was smaller.



4
15.   Maintenance Improvement Program. This was the only troubled component. It consisted of four
sub-components: (a) road rehabilitation and strengthening; (b) improvement of highway maintenance
operations; (c) expanded use of a recently introduced Pavement Management System; and (d)
introduction of a Bridge Management System.
16.   Road Rehabilitation and Strengthening Program (Table A2). This sub-component was affected
with cost overruns and pavement design problems.
17.   Cost Overruns. The total length of roads under this program was originally 562 km which, for
administrative purposes, were divided first into seven packages and then into twelve. At appraisal, this
sub-component was scheduled to be implemented by December 31, 1993. When the Project was
appraised in 1989, pavement evaluation and design, as well as detailed engineering, were not yet done,
so estimates for this program were based on "current unit rates." Pavement evaluation and design, and
detailed engineering for the first two packages, IA and IB, totaling 109.5 km, were prepared by JKR's
Research and Training Institute. Tenders for these two packages were called for at the end of 1990. The
lowest bid prices for packages 1A and lB were RM41.9 million and RM33.6 million respectively (i.e.,
about 120% and 140% higher than the appraisal estimates, including contingencies). Despite this
increase, contracts were awarded. Works started in the second half of 1991 and were finished about two
years later, in the second half of 1993. The estimated cost for the remaining ten packages, revised on the
basis of the contract prices of IA and 1B, was RM331 million. Funds originally allocated to the Sixth
Malaysia Plan under this Program, once reduced by the amount of the contract prices of packages IA
and IB, were not sufficient to carry out works for all of the remaining packages. After the mid-term
review of the Plan, fumds became available for three packages, 3A1, 3A2, and 3B, and eventually for
three more, 3C, 7A and 7B. Works on these six packages did not start until the end of 19942. On June
30, 1996, the revised closing date of the Loan, they were not yet finished. JKR estimated the percentage
of work still to be done from 7% to 33%. The remaining four packages were taken out of the Project
3
and financed 100% percent locally3.
18.   The total road length improved under the eight packages financed under the Project was 336.5
km for a total cost of RM212 million. Works on six of the eight remaining packages was delayed by
three and a half years, mainly because the Government delayed provision of the necessary funds on the
grounds that the anticipated cost was higher than the appraisal estimates, hence the allocations to the
budget were no longer sufficient. The Borrower did not consider that, when the loan was negotiated, it
had requested the Bank to take off the contingencies from the loan amount on the grounds that it would
finance any contingent expenses incurred for the project from its own resources. Physical contingencies
had been estimated at 10% or RM48.80 million (US$18.11 million) and price contingencies at 15% or
RM81.13 million (US$30.10 million) -- i.e. a total of RM129.93 million (US$48.21 million). The loan
amount was reduced accordingly by about US$26 million to US$ 83.2 million.
19.   At the end of 1994, following the escalation of the Project cost and the scaling down of the scope
of the Program, the Loan Agreement was amended upon the Borrower's request4. With this amendment,
2 One year after the original date for Project completion.
3 Package 2 was financed with savings from another project, whereas packages 4, 5 and 6 would be financed
under the Seventh Malaysia Plan.
The Minister of Finance's letter to the the Bank of December 1994, and Bank's reply of December 29, 1994.



5
the total length of roads to be rehabilitated and strengthened was cut down to 326 km from 562 km, a
42% reduction.
20.   Pavement Design.  At the beginning of 1992, when works were already under way, the
consultants supervising road construction retained an expert in pavement evaluation and design whose
findings were that: pavement evaluation and design were inadequate for the weakest sections of the road,
and the drainage of low areas was insufficient. The expert suggested that a thorough revision of the
pavement evaluation and of the drainage system (supervision report of January 17, 1992) should be
carried out. These suggestions applied also to the pavement evaluation and design of the other packages.
One year later, in February 1993, a Bank supervision mission reported that JKR had decided not to
follow the detailed recommendations of the consultants and expert because of the extreme difficulties
encountered in managing traffic, and planned to use a very thick overlay regardless of local conditions.
The Mission pointed out, among other things, that simply placing a layer over a known area of weak
sub-base or base without rectifying the underlying problem will not prevent differential settlements
between the adjacent weak and strong areas leading to a rapid pavement deterioration. The Mission
strongly recommended that JKR should reconsider its approach to this serious problem, however
nothing in the records confirms that JKR eventually adopted the Bank's recommendations. On the other
hand, JKR reported in its April 1993 progress report that in line with the consultants' recommendations,
the department had adopted strengthening overlay with a layer of bituminous bound road base (varying
from 100 to 200 mm) topped with a wearing course of 90 mm uniform thickness. Areas "showing"
severe distress were to be treated prior to laying the bound road base. In places with sub-soil drainage
problems, sub-soil drains had been installed before the laying of the bound road base. Unfortunately,
subsequent Bank supervision reports did not follow up on the actual implementation of JKR's actions.
21. =   _rovement of Highway Maintenance         . Several conditions on road maintenance
were included in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 5, paras. 2a, 2b, 3, and 7; ref.: Table 10), as well as in
the Action Plan for Maintenance Improvement5 agreed by the Borrower. Monitoring parameters and
targets for routine and periodic maintenance, as well as key performance indicators were also included in
the SAR (Annex 3). However, neither the Bank or the Borrower showed much interest and
determination in getting these conditions fulfilled as the following paragraphs show.
22.   The Borrower did not exchange views with the Bank on the allocation of funds for road
maintenance as required, nor did it allocate sufficient funds. Budget allocations for the maintenance of
the federal roads in Peninsular Malaysia (Table Al 0) were lower than the anticipated needs in current
terms for four years out of five. It is worth noting that budget allocations would be even lower than the
anticipated needs in real terms, and that actual annual expenditures for maintenance were not made
available.
23.   Compliance with the covenant to reduce the backlog of deferred periodic maintenance by 70% is
not clear. JKR's progress reports do not include sufficient information.
24.   The Borrower and the Bank did not review the scope and composition of the maintenance
program for federal roads and bridges, as well as the procedure/methods to be applied.
5 SAR, Table 3.2 and Progress Report N° 21, pages 3 1-33.



6
25.   The Borrower did not provide the Bank with data on monitoring road maintenance. It is also not
clear whether the Bank requested such information.
26.   The Borrower did not assign a qualified road engineer, a technical assistant and a technician to be
responsible for all maintenance operations, to each district office in Peninsular Malaysia.
27.   Pavement Management Svstem. JKR adopted a system called the Pavement Appraisal and
Management Suite (PAMS) produced under the Axle Load Study Phase II. According to Progress
Report N° 21, JKR is still directing its efforts towards implementing PAMS. Data collection and the
operation of PAMS are still only used by JKR's headquarters staff with outputs sent to the state JKR
offices for implementation. At the same time, JKR's staff at the state level was trained to be more
efficient in the use of PAMS.
28.   Bridge Management Svstem. The development of software was completed and data on bridges
on major Federal network were also collected. No other information is available.
29.   Replacement of 43 Sub-Standard Bridges and 24 Timber Bridges (Tables A3 & A4). This
component was carried out satisfactorily. All 43 sub-standard bridges were completed at a cost about
11% lower than the appraisal estimate. Out of 24 timber bridges, 15 were completed, four were under
construction by June 30, 1996, four were completed with local funding, and one was dropped because of
alignment problems. Cost per bridge was about 4% lower than the appraisal estimates.
30.   Construction of 35 Weigh Station under a Truck Weight Control Program (Table A5). Civil
works for 32 weigh stations were completed under the Project at a cost of RMI.34 million per station
(11 stations were completed with local funds). Equipment for 43 stations was procured and installed
under the Project at a cost of RM350,000. The average cost per station was about 8% higher than the
appraisal estimates. JKR is no longer responsible for the operation of the stations as the Government
decided to transfer the responsibility to the Road Transport Department (JPJ). Thirty-five stations out of
43 had been handed over to JPJ by June 30, 1996. The remaining eight stations were expected to be
handed over to JPJ by the end of August 1996. This component was carried out satisfactorily.
However, its sustainability depends on: (a) adoption of a proper legal framework; (b) improvement of
division of responsibilities among MOW, the police and JPJ; (c) proper staffing for weigh stations; and
(d) effective implementation by all relevant authorities of axle load limits and associated penalties.
31.   Highway Improvement Program (Table A6). The Program consisted of the improvement of the
Kuantan-Gamgang road (19.38 km) and the Johor Bharu-Kota Tinggi road (36.2 km). At the start of the
Project, JKR and the Bank realized that the designs for these two roads were seven years old, hence
unusable because the condition of the two roads had further deteriorated. Consultants had to be hired to
prepare new designs. Work on the Kuantan-Gamgang road started in October 1992 and was finished in
October 1994, whereas work on the Johor Bharu-Kota Tinggi road started in May 1993 and was finished
in May 1995. The actual total road length improved was 44.6 km as compared with 55.58 km planned at
appraisal. The actual total cost was about RM146 million as compared with RM166 million estimated at
appraisal. However, the actual cost per km was 10% higher than estimated at appraisal. This component
was carried out satisfactorily.



7
32.   Improvement of 42 Hazardous Road Sections. and Construction of 27 Pedestrian Bridges (Tables
6
A7 and A8). Three hazardous road sections were taken out of the Project . Of the remaining 39
sections, 31 were completed and eight were under construction by June 30, 1996. The average cost per
section was about 25% lower than the appraisal estimates. Of the planned 27 pedestrian bridges, 20
were completed and five were under construction by June 30, 1996. The average cost per bridge was
about 8% higher than the appraisal estimates. Physical improvements have been achieved. However,
monitoring data on the reduction of accidents and utilization of pedestrian bridges are not available.
Therefore, assessment of the component effectiveness is rather difficult.
33.   Consultant Services. Technical Assistance and Training (Table A9).  JKR used far more
consulting services for design and supervision under the Highway Rehabilitation and Strengthening
Program than were provided for in the SAR. The cost was 158% higher than estimated at appraisal.
The cost of consulting services for two other programs, Replacement of Timber Bridges and Highway
Improvement, was 68% and 5.1%, respectively, lower than estimated. The total cost of consulting
services, however, was 58% higher than estimated.
34.   Technical assistance was not hired to further develop and disseminate the Pavement Management
System, and to formulate and institute better courses on road and bridge maintenance and construction
supervision at JKR's Training Institute at Bangi.
35.   Several studies were carried out under the Project (Table 7). The studies helped to: (i) prepare a
methodology for Environmental Impact Assessment; (ii) prepare transport plans for two towns; (iii)
review of the Bridge Management System; (iv) introduce safety awareness and concepts; (v) evaluate
slope stability; (vi) evaluate capacity of 200 bridges. In addition, the implementing agency made very
good use of training funds.
E. Project Sustainability
36.   The Project is likely to be sustainable since: (a) the Govermment has increased its allocation for
routine and periodic maintenance of roads; (b) the Govermment is committed to take the necessary steps
to ensure the enforcement of axle load limits; and (c) JKR is committed to the full development on the
Pavement Management Systems.
F. Bank Performance
37.   The Bank identified and appraised the Project well. The only weakness was that the Bank used
"current unit costs" to estimate the cost of the road strengthening and improvement components. Later
on, these cost estimates tumed out to be much lower than actual cost, and the scope of the major
component was cut down. The Bank should have: (a) required that JKR carried out pavement evaluation
and design in accordance with an intemational recognized methodology; (b) increased physical and price
contingencies considerably; and (c) refused the Borrower's request to take all contingencies off the loan
amount.
6One was taken over by the Malaysian Highway Authority, one was improved by force account and one was
part of a road that was privatized.



8
38.   Bank's supervision was relatively weak. The Bank carried out about ten supervision missions, of
which some were very short (Table 13) over the six and a half year Project execution period -- not quite
enough for a Project of this magnitude. In addition, these missions consisted often of only a highway
engineer who focused primarily on physical aspects of the Project. As a result, follow-up was not fully
adequate on the following points: (a) implementation of the detailed and well prepared action plans
agreed upon with the Borrower, as well as the legal covenants; (b) utilization of performance parameters
and targets, as well as key monitoring indicators for maintenance operations; and (c) the method of
reinforcing road pavement actually used by JKR and the quality of the work done. Supervision reports
do not always cover the quality of works, procurement and other information adequately. Ratings were
often optimistic.
G. Borrower Performance
39.   The Borrower did not comply with some conditions of the Loan Agreement and measures of the
Action Plans agreed upon with the Bank (although the Bank itself did not always give sufficient
attention and support). In particular, the Borrower did not: (a) provide funds for the Road Rehabilitation
and Strengthening Program as promptly as needed; (b) make budget allocations for the Improvement of
Maintenance Operations as anticipated; and (c) take the necessary steps to: (i) give JKR total authority
over the assignment of its personnel; (ii) reinforce JKR's district offices with qualified staff to create a
viable maintenance unit in each district office, and (iii) make HPU responsible for the coordination of
investments in highways.  These were important steps to improve the quality of construction
supervision, maintenance operations and highway planning.  For these reasons, the Borrower's
performance regarding covenant compliance can be rated as not fully satisfactory.
40.   JKR, the implementing agency, was, and still is, beset by staff shortages and frequent changes
due to the booming economic situation and lower salaries paid in the public sector. In addition, the very
high turnover of staff contributed to slow down Project implementation. JKR's main weakness
consisted of poor pavement evaluation and designs. JKR's main strengths consisted of reporting
adequately on project execution (except for some performance indicators and monitorable targets),
collaborating very well with the Bank and making good use of consultancy services and training funds.
All things considered, JKR's performance can be rated satisfactory.
H. Assessment of Outcome
41.   Despite some failure by all parties to follow up Loan covenants adequately, the overall rating of
the Project is satisfactory. The Project helped to reinforce JKR's, the contractors' and the consultants'
capability in the maintenance, rehabilitation and strengthening of roads and therefore, achieved its
objective to assist the Government in preserving and improving the federal highway network in order to
meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand safely and adequately. Also, the Project created safety
awareness, provided the tools to control overloading and to preserve the road network, and helped
develop road management systems.

I. Future Operation
42.   The Government has not shown much interest in borrowing from the Bank for future
infrastructure operations. Therefore, in line with the Government interest, no future Bank's operation is
being considered in the transport sector.
J. Key Lessons Learned
43.   The main lessons to be drawn from the project implementation are:
a) more supervision resources should be allocated for projects as large and complex as this. It
is not sufficient to carry out a good appraisal and provide long-term action plans, introduce
covenants and reach agreement with the Borrower on many points during negotiations if
follow-up during supervision cannot be assumed, and in particular, if not supported by
properly staffed mission in the field; and
b) cost estimates of major civil works components should be based on solid and up-to-date
feasibility studies and detailed designs during project preparation and appraisal.
44.   A lesson can also be drawn from the experience of carrying out this Implementation Completion
Report:
a) proper evaluation of achievement of objectives and sustainability of highway projects is
difficult within six months after the closing of the loans. Much information is not yet
available including reliable and useful data on traffic, maintenance operations, and quality of
works which are known with certainty only after two or three years have elapsed.

The Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project. It was completed 16 months (44%) later than expected, and cost was
higher than estimated (30%). Delays were caused by slow right-of-way acquisition and the associated problem of
squatters as well as inadequate performance of the contractor during the initial period of the project. This problem could
have been avoided if right-of-way acquisition and the associated problem of squatters but that should have been known
when the contractor was pre-qualified. due to lack of experience in works of the project scale.
The Second Highway Project. It was completed six years later than expected, and cost was higher than estimated (30%).
The delays were chiefly due to longer than expected right-of way acquisition procedures, and to slow progress by some
contractors. Staff shortages and changes in the PWD hampered the smooth execution of the Project.
Rapid turnover of Bank staff assigned to project supervision and the brevity of supervision missions made it difficult to
maintain the necessary rapport between the Government and the Bank.
The Second Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project. It was completed eighteen months (30%) later than expected,
excluding the sites and services component which was cancelled. Cost was lower than estimated (4%) but, the
Government was still negotiating contractors' claims for about US$3 million which, if paid, would make the underrun
only about I%.
Third Highway Project. Implementation of the main component, construction of roads in Sabah, was slow because of
right-of-way acquisition problems combined with unsatisfactory contractor performance. The three road sections
included in the project were completed one, three and five years behind schedule. The cost was moderately higher than
estimated (6.5%).
Sabah-Sarawak Road Project. It was completed three years later than expected, and most construction contracts
experienced cost overruns. A number of problems with the civil works components were mainly due to inexperience
and lack of financial resources of some of the contractors.

MALAYSIA
HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT (LN. 3145-MA)
PROJECTION COMPLETION REVIEW MISSION
AIDE - MEMOIRE
(December, 1996)
GENERAL
1.    A World Bank mission comprising Anil Bhandari (Senior Transportation Engineer,
EAIIN) visited Malaysia December 17-19, 1996 to conduct a completion review of the.
Highway Rehabilitation and Improvement Project and follow up on the preparation of the
implementation completion report (ICR). Mission met and held discussions with Ir. Neoh
Cheng Aik, Senior Superintending Engineer Design Department, PWD); Ir. George George,
Director (Highway Planning Unit, MOW); and other officials of Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR).
Mission is grateful to the otficials of JKR and MOW for their kind cooperation and hospitality
during the visit.
2.    The main objectives of the were: to review the implementation completion of the main
components of the project and to discuss with the Government of Malaysia (GOM) the
performance of implementing agencies and the Worid Bank during all phases of the project -
fonn preparation to implementation completion.
3.    This aide-memoire which is subject to endorsement by JKR and Bank management,
summarizes the main findings of the mission and records the understandings reached during
the visit.
Project Components and Status of Implementation
4.    Mission reviewed the progress report endirig June 1996 (number 21) and the
Final Evaluation Report (October 1996) prepared by JnR The main components of
the project are: (a) Highway Rehabilitation and Strengthening; (b) Bridge Replacement;
(c) Tiuck Weight Control; (d) Highway Tmprovements; (e) Road Safety Improvement;
(f) Equipment; (g) Consulting Services, Technical Assistance and Training; (h) Land
Acquisition. Highlights of the implementation status are given in the following sections.
5.    Highway Rehabilitation and Strengthening. Under the program, 562 km of
selected Federal Roads in various States were to be rehabilitated by strengthening of
the pavement and widening where necessary. The original cost estimate of this program
was RM 178 miilion (not based or detailed engineering designs) and the likely
completion cost is RM 404 million. A total of 12 e ivil works packages were defined of
which 2 have been completed, 8 are under construction, I has been tendered and 2 are
awaiting authorization for additional funds before tenders can be invited.
Notwithstanding the start up delays, progress of civil works and the quality of
construction are judged satisfactory.

6.    Bridge replacement. This component involves replacement of 20 timber bridges
and 43 substandard bridges on the federal road network in Peninsular Malaysia. A total
of 61 bridges have been completed and 2 are under construction. The quality of
construction is judged satisfactory.
7.    Truck Weigtht Control. The proposed projects under this program involve
construction of 43 weighing stations at strategic locations on the Federal trunk road
network. To date 42 stations have been constructed (eleven with own finds) and
handed over to the control of the Road Transport Department (JPJ) and the remaining
one stations is under construction. The overall implementation program was delayed by
two years due to problems of land acquisition and construction delays. The operation
of the weigh stations is managed by JPJ in collaboration with the Police. JKR is
responsible for maintenance of physical facilities. The legal framework for enforcing the
axle and gross vehicle weights is in place, but some difficulties remain with assigning
qualified staff and housing them in remote areas. JPJ is seeking further powers under
the legal framework to permit unloading of excess loads at the weigh stations without
being liable for damage or loss.
8.    Highway Improvement Tllis component comprised improvement and
upgrading of two critical sections on Kuantan-Gambang road and Johor Bahru-Kota
Tinggi road to control flooding and relieve congestion, respectively. Both sections have
been completed satisfactorily and traffic flow has improved significantly.
9.    Road Safety Improvement. This component consisted of improving 42
hazardous locations and construction of 27 pedestrian bridges. Of the 42 hazardous
locations originally identified, two locations were taken over by other agencies and one
was improved under force account. The remaining works were packaged into 27
contracts of which 16 have been completed and I I are on-going. Overall success and
effectiveness of the safety improvements in reducing number of accidents remains to be
seen in the long run, although some reduction has been reported at 7 sites. The 27 sites
for pedestrian crossing (mainly school children) were packaged into 25 contracts of
which 15 have been completed and 20. The pedestrian crossings have greatly reduced
accidents involving pedestrians, but GOM has recognized the need for more public
education and encouragement to use the pedestrian crossings.
10.   Equipment. Equipment, including computers. for all 43 weighing stations has
been procured under the project.
I.   Consultin, Services, Technical Assistance and Traiinig. This component
comprised consultant services for design, engineering and construction supervision;
provision of technical assistance through experts (pavement and bridge management
specialists, training specialist; transport planner, road safety expert, computer aided
design and drafting, and EIA specialist); and training through fellowships, study tours,
short courses, seminars and conferences. Under this program, JKR engineers and the
Department have benefited greatly through acquiring and being exposed to new
technologies and gaining further knowledge and experience from hands on training by
intemational experts. The program also enabled over 50 road engineers attend
professional courses, seminars, conferences. etc.

12.   Land Acquisition. Approximately RM 26 million were spent by GOM in
acquiring land and compensating for other assets required for road construction and
improvement.
Overall Project Cost and Financing
13.   The total cost for the project at appraisal was estimated as RM 515 million (or
US$ 191 million), including land acquisition cost. At mid-term review December
1993), this was revised to RM 822., million. The actual cost to complete the various
programs in the revised project as at June 30, 1996 is expected to be RM 620.4 million.
The underestimation of costs at appraisal was largely a result of the following main
factors: (a) costs were not based on detailed engineering designs, nor any extensive
feasibility study; (b) the economy was in a recession at the time and prevailing tender
rates were rather low; and (c) the sudden boom in the economy in the 90s led to higher
demand, short supply and high inflation. The preparation of the project was done rather
fast - the significant changes in land use pattems, higher than normal growth in traffic
volumes, and the high incidence of services and utilities required to be relocated
(requiring involvement of a number of outside agencies) were not anticipated.
Performance Ratings
14.   Bank's Perforrance. Notwithstanding the shortcomings outlined in para. 13
above, JKR agreed that Bank's performance in project identification was highly
satisfactory, and in project preparation and appraisal it was satisfactory. However, with
regard to supervision, the ICR prepared by the consultant, has rated Bank's
performance as deficient. This is mainly due to inadequate number of supervision
mnissions (only 10 missions in six and a half years), lack of timely intervention when
project was facing implementation delays, specialists were not included in the mission
teams when required, there was inadequate follow up on non-compliance with legal
covenants and agreed action plan, and key performance indicators and targets were not
closely monitored, nor reported. Supervision reports do not cover adequately issues
related to quality of civil works and procurement problems. However, JKR expressed
its satisfaction with Bank's supervision, particularly with the timely response to Client's
queries and requests for clearances and the mission's understanding of the practical
difficulties in implementing some of the legal covenants and agreed action plan.
15.   Borrower's Performance. Borrower did not comply with some of the loan
covenants and Aith some measures that were required to be undertaken as per the
agreed action plan. This was particularly true with regard to the timely provision of
funds for the road strengthening component and the improvement of maintenance
operations. With regard to Borrower's inability to reinforce JKR's district offices with
qualified staff, JKR explained the difficulties in recruiting staff at a time when the
competing demand and incentives from the private sector were high. JKR emphasized
the need for flexibility during implementation on the part of the Bank in consideration
of practical realities and unique circumstances prevailing during implementation.



- 33 -
16.   With regard to the preparation and implementation of the project, the
Borrower's performance was judged as satisfactory, notwithstanding the start up
delays and mid-termn adjustments required to be made in project scope. Mission
reviewed and discussed the quality of reports submitted by JKR during project
implementation and concluded that the reports were of high quality and adequately
detailed except for reporting of performance indicators and monitorable targets.
Post-construction Economic Evaluation
17.   Mission explained to JKR that Bank needed further information and data to
compute post-construction economic rates of retums on the major investments made
under the project. This was particularly true with regard to: (a) financial versus
economic costs; (b) current unit costs of maintenance; and (c) traffic volumes.
18.   Financial versus Economic Costs. Mission reviewed two recent feasibility
reports prepared by JICA. As per the reports, the conversion factor used in obtaining
economic costs from financial costs ranged from 0.85 to 0.95. It is recommended that
for construction and maintenance costs, the factor 0.90 and for vehicle operating costs
0.88 be used in the absence of any further information.
19.   Mission requested JKR to send urgently to Washington updated information on
traffic volumes on the project roads already completed and the latest available unit
costs for routine and periodic maintenance costs per km.
Borrower's Comments on the draft ICR
20.   Mission stressed the importance of receiving and including in the ICR
Borrower's comments. This would enable the Borrower to clarify any mis-
understandings provide a balanced view of project performance. Since the ICR has to
be presented to Bank's Board before December 31, 1997, JKR agreed to provide a
brief summary of their comments to the Bank by December 23.
