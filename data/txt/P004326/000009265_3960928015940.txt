MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MALAYSIA
FOR A HIGHWAY REHABILITATION AND IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Malaysia for US$83.2 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan
would help finance a highway rehabilitation and improvement project and would
be for a term of 17 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate.
2.          Background.  In 1987-88, the Bank, in cooperation with the Government
of Ma_aysia, carried out a National Transport Policy Review with the objective
of identifying areas where efficiency gains could be made from existing
investments. In part, the Review was a response to the country's severe economic
recession of 1985-86 and the need to formulate investments for Malaysia's Sixth
Development Plan (1990-95) in the context of tight resource constraints. Among
other things, the Review identified weaknesses in transport planning and
coordination as well as the need to improve and maintain the country's road
network, the only mode for which major investments now seem justified. The
Government accepted the thrust of these recommendations, and has requested
financing for the proposed project, which would improve both the planning of road
investments and the condition of the existing road network.
3.          The Bank's involvement in Malaysia's transport sector has been
relatively modest, totalling about US$232 million since 1971. In the highway
subsector, the last Bank project in the economically important states of
Peninsular (West) Malaysia was in 1974; since then, the Bank has participated
in only one highway project, which helped expand the relatively underdeveloped
road network of the East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.
4.          The Road System.  During 1981-85, the Government expanded the road
network at a rate of 8% per annum, more than doubling the length of gravel roads
and increasing the paved road network by 37%. Malaysia's road network now totals
some 42,300 km, including 34,500 km of paved roads, 6,500 km of gravel roads and
1,300 km of earth roads.  Almost half of the total network (20,500 km) is on the
west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Due to budgetary cuts in road maintenance
during the mid-1980s as well as rapid increases in traffic levels and significant
overloading of trucks, the condition of the network has deteriorated, with about
20% of the roads now in only fair condition and 23% considered poor. While the
Government has kept the majority of roads in reasonably good condition through
*       the provision of routine maintenance, it did so only by neglecting periodic
maintenance (resurfacing) requirements. The lack of resurfacing has caused some
sections of the federal road network in Peninsular Malaysia to deteriorate to
such an extent that major rehabilitation and strengthening are now needed to
return the roads to the condition required to support current and anticipated
traffic levels. The Roads Branch of the Department of Public Works (JKR) has
recently begun to carry out some of this work with the help of contractors; while
this approach seems cost-effective, the quality of work carried out thus far has
not been wholly satisfactory due to inadequate staff capabilities in contractor
supervision.

5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project would be the
Bank's first involvement in the highway subsector in Peninsular Malaysia in 15
years and would provide a vehicle by which to begin implementation of
recommendations of the National Transport Policy Review, specifically its
proposals for improved road transport planning, increased maintenance budgets
for federal highways, and enforcement of truck axle-load restrictions. In
addition, the Government has requested Bank assistance in improving highway
maintenance planning, programming, operations and monitoring. With continued
limited funds available for road maintenance, the Government intends to
concentrate on improving the efficiency of maintenance operations, which have
not kept pace with development of the network or with traffic growth.  The
proposed project would therefore provide necessary external expertise for this
purpose as well as for improved monitoring of road safety and the environmental
impact of road works.
6.          Eroiect Objectives.  Besides addressing the major issues identified
in the National Transport Policy Review, the project would help JKR to achieve
the Government's goals for the subsector, that is, to preserve and improve the
existing highway network to meet increasing transport demand and thus provide
support to the productive sectors of the economy by reducing travel costs and
increasing accessibility. The project would assist the Government to improve
highway and bridge maintenance operations on the federal highway network,
focussing on the technical and institutional aspects of highway maintenance to
improve the efficiency of activities and promote the provision of adequate
budgetary allocations for the federal highway maintenance program. Furthermore,
as a first step in improving overall transport planning, the project would
initiate the coordination of federal and state highway planning by MOW's Highway
Planning Unit (HPU).
7.          Proiect  DescriRtion.    The  project  would have  the  following
components: (a) implementation of a Maintenance Improvement Program, including
the rehabilitation and strengthening of some 562 km of road pavements and
improvement of road and bridge maintenance procedures and operations; (b)
replacement of about 24 timber bridges and 43 substandard concrete bridges; (c)
improvement of two roads totaling 56 km; (d) various physical works under a Road
Safety Improvement Program; (e) construction of 35 weigh stations in conjunction
with a Truck Weight Control Program; (f) consultant services and technical
assistance to strengthen HPU's highway planning capability, improve JKR's road
and bridge maintenance capabilities, supervise project works, improve road safety
monitoring and establish methodologies for determining the environmental impact
of road works; and (g) training of JKR staff in supervision of construction and
maintenance done by contractors, maintenance programming and operations, traffic
engineering and road safety analysis.  A breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Retroactive financing for up to 10% of
the loan amount is recommended for expenditures incurred after May 1,1989.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement as well as the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of the key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Malaysia are given in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7995-MA dated November 28,1989 is being distributed separately.



8.          Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Gover-nment to: (a) make HPU responsible for coordination of federal and
state investments in highways and for coordination of these investments with
other transport investments planned by the Ministry of Transport; (b) reduce by
at least 70% by December 31,1994 the existing backlog of deferred periodic
maintenance of roads; (c) annually exchange views with the Bank on the proposed
budgetary allocations for maintenance for the coming year; (d) annually to review
with the Bank the federal road maintenance program for the coming year; (e) carry
out agreed Action Plans for the Maintenance Improvement, Truck Weight Control
and Road Safety Improvement Programs to be implemented under the project; and
(f) carry out an agreed maintenance training program during the project period.
9.          Benefits.  The main benefit associated with the rehabilitation and
improvement of roads under the project is the substantial savings in vehicle
operating costs accruing to road users. The two highway improvement subprojects
have economic rates of return (ERRs) of 21% and 33%, while project components
for highway upgrading/rehabilitation and timber bridge replacement have ERRs
ranging from 12% to over 100% since these investments are preserving or improving
existing assets of substantial value. All project components yield ERRs above
10%, which is the opportunity cost of capital in Malaysia. The weighted average
ERR of all project components for which benefits have been quantified is 24%.
Sensitivity analysis indicates that even with a 20% increase in costs and a 20%
decrease in benefits, project investments would still be justified, with ERRs
ranging from 12% to 25%.
10.         Benefits expected from improved and expanded maintenance operations
as a result of the Maintenance Improvement Program and project technical
assistance and training are also not quantified, but in the future should
translate into significant savings in vehicle operating costs.
11.         Risks.   There are no major risks associated with the physical
implementation of the project. While there is a possibility that difficulties
with land acquisition could delay implementation of the road improvement
component (56 km), this matter is being vigorously pursued by the Government,
which has already frozen the necessary rights of way. The project schedule for
this component also includes some slack for delays.
12.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
