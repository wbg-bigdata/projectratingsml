I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested a Bank loan of US$44.1 million
to finance the Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and Energy Saving (Phase
II) Project (the Project). The Project has Eour components: (i) engineering
for modernization of the Iskenderun plant of Gubre Fabrikalari T.A.S. (GUBRE),
(ii) rationalization and energy saving investments at the Mersin plant of
Akdeniz Gubre Sanayii A.S. (AKGUBRE), the Foca plant of Ege Gubre Sanayii A.S.
(EGE), and the Samsun plant of Karadeniz Bakir Isletmeleri A.S. (KBI); (iii)
expansion of training facilities of the four companies; and (iv) preparation
of one study--the Fertilizer Raw Material Resource Study. The Project is
expected to increase finished fertilizer production annually by about 630,000
tons, sulfuric acid production by 240,000 tons, nitric acid production by
180,000 tons, phosphoric acid by 25,000 tons,, and blister copper production
by 10,000 tons, which at 1981 prices are worth about US$280 million.
1.02      In the case of the Iskenderun Complex, the Project will help carry
out the engineering work to establish a new cdiammonium phosphate (DAP) plant
in the place of the existing old triple superphosphate (TSP) plant and meet
the increasing demand for DAP which has more nutrient content than TSP, and
modernize its existing sulfuric and phosphoric acid producing facilities.
In the case of the Mersin, Foca and Samsun plants, the Project aims princi-
pally at rationalizing existing operations ar.d removing capacity-limiting
bottlenecks. In addition, new ammonium sulfate (AS) facilities will be
established at Mersin to substitute for AS inports; the existing facilities at
Foca will be modified to provide operational flexibility to produce DAP
(18-46-0) and 15-45-0, a complex fertilizer similar to DAP, while reducing the
production of the 20-20-0 grade for which the installed production capacity
exceeds demand in Turkey.
1.03      The total financing required for the Project is estimated at US$85.5
million including US$55.3 million in foreign exchange. The proposed Bank Loan
of US$44.1 million, equivalent to nearly 52% of the total financing requirements
and 80% of the total foreign exchange cost, includes US$38.8 million for
improving the operation of the four plants and the remaining US$5.3 million
for the other two components. The remaining financial requirements will be
met by internal cash generation by the companies (US$40.4 million) and the
Government (US$1 million).
1.04      The Training Component will expand training at the plant and head-
quarter levels supplemented by training of selected personnel abroad. The
Fertilizer Raw Material Resource Study will examine the local fertilizer raw
material base in Turkey including the problem, of disposal and the possible
utilization of by-products (e.g., pyrite cinders) and help prepare a Master Plan
for the expansion of the fertilizer industry.
1.05      The proposed loan will be the third Bank operations in the fer-
tilizer sector in Turkey. The first loan (US';24 million) followed by a
supplemental loan (US$18 million) was for the IGSAS Fertilizer Project which
was commissioned in 1978 and is operating at about 85% capacity. IGSAS is
the most successful fertilizer companies in Turkey today. The second loan
(US$110 million) was for the Phase I of the Fertilizer Industry Rationalization
and Energy Saving Project (Report No. P-3029-TU of April 15, 1981) which
became effective in September 1981 and is currently under satisfactory implemen-
tation. Phase I covers improvements in the opweration of four fertilizer



-2 -
plants. The proposed Phase II Project covers three additional fertilizer
plants and a copper smelter which supplies its by-product sulfuric acid for
fertilizer production, thus helping to complete the overall program prepared
by the Government in close consultation with the Bank, to increase capacity
utilization in Turkey's fertilizer sector from 40% in 1980 to 85% by 1986/87.
1.06      The Project was preappraised along with the Phase I Project in
March/April 1980 following preparation of project reports by the companies
concerned. As the mission identified the need for additional project prepara-
tion to carry out the appraisal, the Government requested and the Bank agreed
to provide US$600,000 from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) in June
1980 to complete the preparation of seven fertilizer projects identified for
rehabilitation. After the preparation was completed, it was agreed with the
Government that their rehabilitation would have to be carried out in two
phases, as the task is complex and foreign exchange funds required far exceeded
the resources available in FY81. Accordingly, four plants were included
under the Phase I Project and the rest in the Phase II Project. Following
the approval of the loan for the Phase I Project in May 1981, the Government
requested that the Bank consider financing the Phase II Project as soon as
possible in the light of the high priority accorded by Turkey for rehabil-
itating the fertilizer sector to increase local fertilizer production and
reduce imports. A mission consisting of Messrs. Y. T. Shetty (Chief), L. Borin,
T. Ogmen (Consultanit) and Mrs. Priscilla Urbano visited Turkey in June/July 1981
to appraise the Project.
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
A. Industrial Sector
2.01      During 1950-1977, the Turkish economy grew at an impressive pace and
underwent marked transformation. As a result of the country's strong commitment
to growth, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose, on average, by more than 6%
a year. Rapid industrialization led to substantial changes in the structure
of the economy: the share of industry in GDP at factor cost increased from
10% to 24% while the share of agriculture declined from 52% to 23% during the
same period. However, the striking economic progress had been punctuated
(in 1958, 1970 and 1977) by severe balance of payments crises, mainly because
of Turkey's inability to develop a strong export base coupled with heavy debt
service on foreign borrowings, mostly short and medium term. Particularly,
the economic crisis which started in mid-1977 proved a serious one. Real GDP
increased 2.8% in 1978, decreased by 0.9% in 1979 and by 0.8% in 1980. In
1981, it is expected to increase by 3.5%.
2.02      Turkey's planned development strategy has given high priority
to industrialization and the development of the regions outside the major
urban centers. The Government promoted industrial investment in priority
industries through incentives including investment allowances, tax and tariff
exemptions or deferment. As a result of these incentives, supplemented by
protection against competition from imports, Turkey had achieved a high level
of investment in industry and, during the last three Five-Year Plans (1963-77),
industrial output grew at an annual average rate of about 10%. Reflecting



the general economic showdown during 19         inuustLal oucpu. dezcrs_c._
an annual rate of 1.7%. The industrial growth rate is expected to rise to
4.5-5% in 1981. Textiles, iron and steel, fertilizers, chemicals, paper,
sugar, cement, plastic and machinery have beEn the main growth industries.
Industry now accounts for about 13% of the total employment in the country-
2.03      In Turkey, the public sector and within it the State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs) play an important role in industrialization. In addition
to SEEs, the public sector consists of a few autonomous companies which are
indirectly owned by the Government but run largely along lines of private
sector companies. Public sector companies invest mostly in projects of
national importance and in projects normally not taken up by the private
sector due to size, profit and/or risk considerations. The present Government
is shifting emphasis away from the public sector towards a more market-oriented
economy. The private sector is being encouraged in many fields, and foreign
investments are now being actively encouraged, especially when they introduce
new and advanced technology, help to overcome energy problems, or promote
exports.
2.04      Operational SEEs today account for about half of the country's
production in mining and manufacturing. A number of problems are affecting
them in varying degrees. They include frequent changes in management, over-
staffing, low salary scales, high turnover of experienced staff, lack of
imported materials, slow application of modern business practices, and lack of
cost control systems. Some of these problems arise from the Government's past
use of the SEEs to achieve various social objectives such as the development
of backward areas, the provision of employment, the sale of essential goods at
low prices, and control of SEE product prices in general to reduce domestic
inflation; others are largely due to administrative inefficiencies.
2.05      Reform of the SEEs--in organization, management and manpower
development--remains crucial for improvement in the performance of SEEs.
Over the years, SEEs have earned low profits, necessitating increasing
budgetary transfers to meet their current and investment needs. Especially
since 1973, there has been a serious deterioration in the financial situation
of SEEs. Successive governments, in an effort to slow down inflation, held
SEEs' price increases below the rate at which costs were rising, while, at
the same time, the scale of their investment was increasing sharply. The net
effect was a very rapid widening of the gap between SEEs savings and invest-
ment. With the substantial budgetary transfers required for SEEs, the
consolidated budget deficit grew from an average of TL 17 billion over the
years 1974-77 to TL 192 billion in 1980. Most of this increased deficit was
financed by borrowing from the Central Bank. This situation, combined with
cost-push factors such as the powerful labor novement, the agricultural price
support policy and, above all, excess domestic demand put an upward pressure
on the country's price levels, with inflation reaching an annual average
rate of about 100% in 1980. In 1981, the rate of inflation declined to about
40%.
2.06      In January 1980, Turkey adopted a Stabilization Program which
included a move toward a more market-oriented system for SEEs, introduction
of a crawling peg exchange rate system, raising of interest rates to induce
savings, allowing most SEEs freedom to set their own prices, and limiting SEE
access to the Central Bank and to the budget. Now further measures are being



-4 -
pursued including removing SEE management from political interference, restrict-
ing hiriLng of personnel in public enterprises which are overmanned, raising
profess:lonal and managerial salaries to more competitive levels, and further
reduction in public subsidies. Progress made under these measures is monitored
under the Structural Adjustment Lending to Turkey.
B. Feritilizer Industry
2.07      Turkey's fertilizer production started in 1939 on a small scale at
Karabuk Iron and Steel Works with the production of ammonium sulfate as a
by-product based on coke oven gas. Seventeen other plants by ten different
companies have since then been set up, including the Tutunciftlik ammonia/urea
project of Istanbul Gubre Sanayii A.S. (IGSAS) financed by the Bank (MAP
IBRD-1265R). There are six companies producing exclusively fertilizers. Of
these, two--Azot Sanayii T.A.S. (AZOT) and IGSAS--are in the public sector
and operate seven plants, two--Gubre Fabrikalari (GUBRE) and Akdeniz Gubre
Sanayii (AKGUBRE) are in the joint sector and operate three plants; and
three--Bagfas, Tekfen and Ege Gubre (EGE)--are in the private sector and
operate four plants. In addition, three public sector companies--a petro-
chemical company (Petkim) and two steel companies (Karabuk and Isdemir)--are
producing ammonium sulfate fertilizer as a by-product in three plants. A
new company, Toros Gubre, in the private sector is expected to start fertil-
izer production in 1981.
2.08      The various operating plants, their annual capacities and recent
production are given in Annex 2-1. The total annual capacity of the plants is
about five million product tons equivalent to nearly one million tons of
nitrogen (N) and 850,000 tons of phosphorous (P) nutrients. The public sector
companies account for 47% of total fertilizer capacity; the joint sector
accounts for 27%; and the private companies for the remaining 26%. The
following table summarizes the trend of capacity utilization during 1976-80 by
the operating companies:

5-
2.09      Industrywide capacity utilization performance hit the bottom in 1978
as a result of the serious economic crisis in the country. Since then, there
has been some improvement in the performance. In 1980, the average capacity
utilization in the fertilizer industry was 53,7 for N and 45% for P. These
percentages are still low mainly due to: (i) technical bottlenecks arising from
design deficiencies and poor maintenance; (ii) inadequate availability of
imported raw materials, intermediate products and spare parts; (iii) defi-
ciencies in the supply of local raw materials and utilities (poor and uneven
quality and unreliable supply of lignite, pyr:Ltes, rock phosphate, etc., and
power and water shortages); (iv) working capital problems; (v) organization
and management deficiencies; and (vi) lack of trained manpower. The proposed
Project represents Phase II of the Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and
Energy Saving Program, developed by the Goverlment in consultation with the
Bank, for overcoming technical bottlenecks, power and water shortages, and
organizational and manpower problems. Together with it, the Government is
giving priority in the allocation of foreign exchange to fertilizer inputs
rather than finished product imports. This imiport program is supported by the
Bank's Structural Adjustment Lending. Agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment that it will provide adequate foreign exchange to the companies to meet
full requirements of imported raw materials oi- the facilities rehabilitated
under the Project (para 5.16).
2.10      To alleviate local raw material and utility supply problems, the
Government is now giving more attention to coordination between fertilizer
producers and their raw material supplies to :Lmprove the quality and quantity
of local raw materials. Under the Phase I Project, the Government has agreed
to establish a Coordination Committee to periodically review fertilizer raw
material supply problems and evolve solutions. Furthermore, fertilizer
producers are planning to install facilities at the plants to handle and use
the raw materials of poor and uneven quality (e.g., facilities for mixing low,
medium and high quality lignite at plant site;, facilities to grind phosphate
rock before use, etc.). One of the projects iJinanced in FY1981 under a
separate Bank operation through the State Investment Bank (Ln. 1998-TU) will
increase raw material supply to the existing copper smelters in Turkey,
helping them to produce more copper as well as by-product flotation pyrites
and sulfuric acid which are used for the production of phosphatic fertilizers.
The working capital problem arising from delayed payment from the marketing
organization is being addressed by the Governtient by increased allocation from
the budget for this purpose.
2.11      Organization and management issues of AZOT, a SEE and the largest
fertilizer company, are being dealt with under Phase I through the Management
Improvement Program and technical assistance i-or plant operations and main-
tenance, and project implementation.  The training in both Phase I and II will
help ease the problem of trained manpower.
2.12      Of the eighteen fertilizer plants, seven were identified by a
Bank preappraisal mission and the Government as high priority, suitable for
possible Bank financial and technical assistance to remove technical bottle-
necks and improve capacity utilization. Of the remaining plants, some are
small and old in which the scope for increasing capacity utilization is
limited. In some others, capacity utilization could be increased easily
(mainly in private sector companies) if they aLre provided with adequate
foreign exchange to import raw materials. This is being done now partly with
ftnds from the Bank-s Structural Adjustment Loans. Further, as a result of



- 6 -
some other concerted measures taken by the Government so far (e.g., increase
in fertilizer prices), average capacity utilization of the fertilizer industry
is estimated to have reached 69% for N and 64% for P in 1981. The average
capacity utilization is forecast to rise further to 85% for both N and P by
1986/87 after the implementation of the Phase I and II projects.
2.13      As noted previously, the Bank assisted the Government and the
companies in preparing the rationalization program and provided PPF funds in
June 1980 to the Government to complete the preparation of the seven fertilizer
sub-projects identified for rehabilitation. Four engineering firms--Krupp-
Koppers, Uhde and Davy International (FRG), and Heurtey (France) were subse-
quently hired to complete the preparation of those projects. Of the seven
sub-projects, four were included under the Phase I Project (approved on May 7,
1981, Ln. 1985-TU) and the rest are included under the proposed Phase II
Project. The Phase I Project also included repayment of funds advanced under
PPF for preparation of both the Phase I and proposed Phase II projects. The
plants included under Phase I are: the Kutahya IS and Samsun Fertilizer
Plants of AZOT; the Tutunciftlik Fertilizer Plant of IGSAS; and the Yarimca
Fertilizer Plant of GUBRE. The proposed Project includes engineering for
modernization of the Iskenderun Fertilizer Plant of GUBRE, and rationalization
and energy saving investments at the Mersin Fertilizer Plant of AKGUBRE, the
Foca Fertilizer Plant of EGE and the existing copper smelter and the related
sulfuric acid plant of KBI at Samsun. The Government gives high priority to
the implementation of both phases to increase local fertilizer production and
decrease fertilizer imports which cost US$493 million in 1980.
C.   Raw Material Base
2.14      Turkey depends on imported raw materials--including hydro-carbon
products, rock phosphate and sulfur--for its fertilizer production as the
local resources are not fully explored. As a result, during 1980 and 1981, the
country imported US$589 million worth of materials for fertilizer production.
2.15      Hydrocarbon Feedstocks:  Petroleum derivatives (naphtha and fuel
oil) and natural gas are the usual sources of hydrocarbon feedstocks for
nitrogenous (N) fertilizer production. Most of the feedstock inputs, naphtha,
refinery gases, and fuel oil, are supplied by the domestic refineries which
produce them while processing crude oil to produce light and middle distillates
(gasoline, diesel, kerosene) needed in the country. Turkey's domestic crude
oil production of about 2.5 million tons accounts for hardly one-fifth of its
annual consumption. This leads to direct and indirect imports of the main
inputs for N fertilizer production. Reserves of natural gas, the most
efficient feedstock for N production have recently been found at Thrace in the
northwest (MAP IBRD-13625R). It will take some time before the drilling
required for developing a gas production program is completed and estimates of
proven gas reserves and their composition are finalized. Finally, the country
also relies on imported ammonia for the production of N fertilizers, and in
recent years, Turkey has been importing 100,000-150,000 tons of ammonia
annually.
2.16      Aware of its lack of oil-based hydrocarbons, Turkey is considering
the feasibility of basing its future ammonia production partly on its extensive
lignite (brown coal) deposits estimated at about 6 billion tons. Turkey
already has two lignite-based ammonia plants in operation, but one (Kutahya)
is small in size, and the second (Kutahya II), though of a larger size, has



not been operating well because of technical and operational problems. The
Kutahya II plant is being rehabilitated under the Phase I Project. The Bank
is also assisting the Turkish authorities in evaluating the desirability of
implementing additional lignite-based fertilizer plants.
2.17      Rock Phosphate:  Turkey has phosphate rock deposits in Mazidagi,
Aydin-Mugla, and some other regions; but so far only limited geological
prospection and beneficiation tests have been conducted. The Elazig plant of
AZOT, designed to operate on local phosphate rock, has encountered mechanical
d:Lfficulties in its use. Most of the Turkish phosphate deposits are difficult
to mine; the rock is low in phosphorus (P) content and also contains impuri-
ties that can be removed only by means of expensive beneficiation processes.
Further, most of the deposits are located in remote regions with limited
transportation infrastructure. As a result, about 80% of total phosphate
fertilizer production is currently based on itnported phosphate rock. The Bank
is discussing with the Turkish authorities the prospects for exploring and
exploiting local rock phosphate deposits.
2.18      Sulfur:  Due to its relatively smalil deposits and the small produc-
tion of sulfur as a by-product of oil refinery operations, Turkey can meet
only a minor portion of its sulfur requirements for fertilizer production.
However, Turkey has large deposits of pyrites (iron sulfide), often with
copper pyrites, though they are not as easy to use as sulfur in the production
of sulfuric acid. Many of the existing sulfuric acid plants of fertilizer
companies based on local pyrites are experiencing technical problems, mostly
dtLe to the poor quality and high moisture of pyrites. Facilities included in
the Phase I Project will help in partly overccoming these problems.
2.19      In the long term, as the resource base is fully evaluated and
technology is further developed, prospects are good for Turkey to maximize the
use of local materials such as lignite, phosphate rock, and pyrites.  In
addition, oil and gas exploration efforts have been stepped up to increase
hydrocarbon production, and confirmation of substantial gas reserves will
offer an opportunity to produce nitrogen fertilizers from this preferred
feedstock. These aspects will be examined in detail under the proposed
Fertilizer Raw Material Resource Study included under the Project (Annex 2-2).
This study will provide a sound basis for the long-term planning of the
fertilizer sector in the country.
III. THE COMPANIES
3.01     The Second Fertilizer Industry Ratioralization and Energy Saving
Project involves four companies: Gubre Fabrikalari T.A.S. (GUBRE), Akdeniz
Gubre Sanayii A.S. (AKGUBRE), Ege Gubre Sanayii A.S. (EGE) and Karadeniz Bakir
Isletmeleri A.S. (KBI).  GUBRE and AKGUBRE are joint sector companies with
public ownerships of 34% and 47%, respectively. EGE is in the private sector
and KBI is in the public sector.
A.   Gubre Fabrikalari T.A.S. (GUBRE)
1.    History and Organization
3.02     GUBRE was established in 1953 and, currently, three State-owned
organizations--T. C. Ziraat Bankasi (Agricultural Bank), AZOT and T. C.
Zirai Donatim Kurumu (DONATIM)--own 34% of the shares; agricultural coop-
eratives and insurance companies own 35%; and private enterprises and the



-8-
general public own the remaining 31%. The Company has two complexes: one
at Yarimca in northern Turkey which produces TSP and NPK fertilizers, and
the other at Iskenderun in southern Turkey which produces TSP.
3.03      The direction and management of GUBRE is exercised by a Board of
Directors comprised of seven members and three auditors. Executive management
of the Company is vested in the General Manager who is also the chief executive
for day-to-day operations. He attends Board meetings but is not a member of
the Board. Top management staff are headquartered in Istanbul and are able
and experienced. Headquarters staff are organized under two deputy general
managers, one technical and the other administrative. The operations, plan-
ning and investment departments report to the Technical Deputy Manager; and
the accounting, commerce, marine transport personnel and office services
departments report to the Administrative Deputy General Manager. The plant
managers at Yarimca and Iskenderun are capable and they report to the
deputy general managers. The company management and staff are considered
capable of implementing the project facilities efficiently.
2. Production Performance

3.05      The rehabilitation of the Yarimca Complex which is included in Phase I
of the Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and Energy-Saving Project covers:
(i) the addition of a new sulfur-based sulfuric acid plant; (ii) the rehabili-
tation of the existing phosphoric acid plant and related facilities; (iii) the
rehabilitation of the TSP plant including the installation of new mixing
granulation and drying sections; and (iv) the installation of facilities for
gypsum disposal. The Yarimca Complex showed an average capacity utilization
of about 87% in 1981 compared to about 66% in 1980. This capacity utilization
level cannot be sustained as this old Complex is likely to experience break-
downs and stoppages. As a result, the capacity utilization is likely to
decrease to about 65% by 1985 without rehabilitation. However, with the
rehabilitation of the Complex under the Phase I Project, the capacity utiliza-
tion is expected to reach about 90%.



-9-
3.06     The Iskenderun Complex, located about 10 km north of the town of
Iskenderun, was originally built as a single superphosphate (SSP) plant in
1954 and was converted to the production of rsP in 1968. It was subse-
quently expanded in the mid-1970s with the addition of a second reaction
den and sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid production facilities. The TSP
plant is based on the Broadfield Den process for reaction and the Profabril
process for granulation. The sulfuric and plhosphoric acid plants are based
on Sim-Chem/Monsanto and Rhone-Poulenc proce3ses, respectively. The
engineering contractor for the complex was Woodhall-Duckham (UK).
3.07     The present TSP plant has been in operation for about 25 years and
corrosion and wear on many components have reached advanced levels. This has
resulted in increased maintenance costs. Howiever, the plant showed high
capacity utilization (86%) in 1981 compared t:o 66% in 1980. This capacity
utilization level cannot be sustained as the plant is likely to experience
major breakdowns and stoppages. As a result, capacity utilization is expected
to drop to 40% in 1983 and the subsequent yeErs unless the necessary additional
spare parts, which are included under the Project, are provided. The mixers,
blenders, granulators and dryers are the major items of equipment affected by
corrosion. Some items have been in service fcr about eight years while others
date back to the original SSP units. The plant is considered capable of
operating economically up to 1988 with increased maintenance expenditures.
Subsequently, an extensive rehabilitation prcgram, at an estimated cost of
about US$5 million, would add only a few years to the life of the plant.
Further, according to the results of studies carried out by the Ministry of
Agriculture, DAP, a binary fertilizer, is more suitable to soil and crop
conditions in Turkey than TSP, a single nutrient fertilizer. These factors
are also reflected in the market trends; while the consumption of TSP is
declining in the primary marketing area of the plant, demand for DAP is
increasing there. Considering the increasing demand for DAP-and the run-down
condition of the TSP unit, GUBRE is planning to establish a new DAP plant at
Iskenderun by the end of 1988, when the final shutdown of the TSP unit is
planned. The new plant would include an economic sized 660 tpd (211,000 tpy)
DAP unit and some offsites, including a new 1,000 tpd bagging unit and
anti-pollution installations. Engineering for these new facilities as well as
spare parts for the existing facilities, including the TSP plant, will be
financed under the proposed Project. After prcovision of spare parts, TSP
production is expected to increase from 40% to 50-65% during 1983-86 before
the plant is finally phased out at the end of 1988.
3.08     The Iskenderun Complex depends on imported rock phosphate and
pyrites (partly domestic). Sulfuric acid is imported occasionally when the
acid plant is down for repairs. The new DAP unit will also require liquid
ammonia which will be imported. The existing unloading and handling facili-
ties and the water and steam supply systems are adequate to meet the needs
after rehabilitation. In order to improve the on-stream time of the Iskenderun
facilities, however, a new 700 KW emergency generator and a 500-ton fuel oil
storage facility will be required. Further, the existing storage facilities
need to be expanded by adding two 3,000-ton phosphoric acid tanks and one
10,000-ton atmospheric ammonia storage tank with auxiliary facilities.
3.09     Certain parts of both the sulfuric ard phosphoric acid plants have
deteriorated, affecting capacity utilization. Engineering work will be
carried out for: (i) rehabilitating those plants; (ii) bringing down pollution
to internationally acceptable standards, including production of 20,000 tpy of



- 10 -
ammonium sulfate (AS) as a by-product when facilities are established to scrub
sulfur dioxide (SO ) stack gases from the sulfuric acid plant with ammonia to
reduce pollution; iiii) installing a new 660 tpd DAP plant along with necessary
offsites; and (iv) expanding the storage facilities for raw materials and
intermediate products.

a/ Company estimates using 1981 first-half prices.
3.11   GUBRE has been showing profits every year during the last five years
partly due to its higher capacity utilization than most other fertilizer
companies. Net profit increased sharply during 1979-80 due to higher ex-
factory prices, fixed by the Government and improved capacity utilization
due to easier availability of imported spare parts and raw materials under
the IBRD Structural Adjustment Loans. However, estimates for 1981 show net
profit declining substantially with ex-factory prices for the second half
of the year not having been fixed yet. When such prices are finally fixed and
GUBRE's accounts adjusted, the Company expects to maintain in 1981 its level
of profitability and financial structure as in 1980. GUBRE had a debt/equity
ratio of 64/36 and a current ratio of 1.2:1 in 1981 which, under the Company's
efforts to keep its inventories and receivables at the minimum level in the
face of the present high inflation and real interest rates in Turkey, is
satisfactory but would be low under normal conditions. As discussed in
Chapter VII, the Company is expected to be able to finance from internally
generated funds the local cost of the Iskenderun sub-project (para 7.13).

B.   Akdeniz Gubre Sanayii A.S. (AKGUBRE)
1.   History and Organization
3.12     AKGUBRE, a joint-sector company was established in 1968 to produce
CAN and DAP fertilizers. In 1980, it had a paid-up capital of TL 590 million,
with ownership distributed as follows: AZOT, 47.3%; Petrochemical Industries
Company/Kuwait Sulphur Co. (Kuwait), 47.3%; Turkiye Is Bankasi, 2.7%; and
Sekerbank T.A.S., 2.7%. The Company's production complex is located in
Mersin, on the southern coast (Map IBRD-1362;R). Both management and tech-
nical offices of the Company are at the plan- site, and a commercial office
is maintained in Ankara.
3.13      The direction and management of AKGUBRE is exercised by a Board of
Directors composed of six members and three auditors. Executive management
of the Company is vested in the General Manager who is the chief executive
for day-to-day operations. The management staff are headquartered at Mersin.
The Company is organized under a General Manager and two Deputy General
Managers, one technical and the other administrative. The operational planning
and other supporting services, production and maintenance departments report
to the Technical Deputy General Manager, and accounting and finance, commerce,
personnel and office service departments report to the Administrative Deputy
General Manager. The company management and staff are capable and are ex-
pected to implement the rehabilitation project efficiently.
2. Production Performance
3.14      The design capacities and the recert trend of AKGUBRE-s production
facilities are summarized below:

3.15     In 1981, the capacity utilization was only 56% and 35% for CAN and
DAP, respectively. Serious technical problems specifically in the sulfuric,
phosphoric and nitric acid plants are the main cause for continuing low capacity
utilization in the complex. The capacity utilization has not so far exceeded
52% in the sulfuric acid plant, 46% in the phosphoric acid plant and 51% in the
nitric acid plant. With the proposed rehabilitation project, it is expected
that the capacity utilization of the Complex, including the acid units, would
gradually go up to 85-90%.
3.16     The Mersin Complex was completed in 1972 with Haldor Topsoe (Denmark)
as Technical Advisor and the following firms as engineering contractors:



- 12 -
Lurgi (FRG) for the sulfuric acid plant, Bamag (FRG) for the nitric acid,
phosphoric acid and DAP plants; Continental Engineering for the CAN plant and
storage/bagging facilities; Chicago Bridge (US) for the ammonia terminal and
storage and handling facilities. The complex is composed of a 650-tpd sulfuric
acid plant based on flotation pyrites and using Lurgi process; a 215-tpd
phosphoric acid plant using Pechiney-Saint Gobain (presently Rhone-Poulenc)
process; a nitric acid plant with two trains of 550 tpd each using the Bamag
Verfahrens Technik process, an 800-tpd CAN unit using Stamicarbon process, and
a 450 tpd DAP unit using process.
3.17      The Complex depends on imported phosphate rock and ammonia, and
pyrites; (partly local). For ammonia imports, a jetty with a capacity of up
to 25,000 DWT is available. Unloading capacity is 700 tph but up to 1,200
tph can be achieved. The existing bulk unloading capacity will not meet the
requirements of the plant after the rehabilitation when imported bulk raw
materials could reach, at maximum capacity, about 260,000 tpy of rock phosphate
and 200,000 tpy of flotation pyrites. Even at less than 50% capacity utiliza-
tion at: present, the Company is experiencing problems in getting the imported
bulk materials unloaded promptly at the Mersin harbor where the congestion
has increased over the years. To solve this problem, the Government has
proposed that since two new cranes will be made available for the Iskenderun
port by the end of 1982 under the Bank-financed Ports Rehabilitation Project
(Loan 1741-TU), two of the four existing old cranes in Iskenderun could be
transferred to Mersin after reconditioning for installation next to the
existing 1,000 tpd crane at the ammonia terminal of AKGUBRE in the Mersin
jetty. This will help increase the unloading capacity near the ammonia
terminal from 1,000 tpd to over 2,000 tpd, thus helping to overcome the
problem of AKGUBRE.  Agreement has been reached with the Government that it
will install two cranes at the ammonia terminal at Mersin by June 30, 1983 to
eliminate the bottlenecks at the port affecting unloading of imported inputs to
the AKGUBRE plant.
3.18      Besides the rehabilitation of the existing plants, a new 200,000 tpy
ammonium sulfate (AS) unit will be added to the complex. The addition of
this unit was decided on the basis of the recommendation of the Ministry of
Agriculture to meet the demand for AS in Mersin and the surtounding areas
where the soil is highly calcareous and requires a fertilizer, such as AS,
which could act also as a Ph modifier. Besides, the region is an important
grower of cotton and sugarbeet for which AS is considered a suitable fertilizer
especially in areas without adequate irrigation facilities. The new unit will
use a major part of the sulfuric acid production (150,000 tpy) at Mersin. As
a result, the availability of sulfuric acid for the production of phosphoric
acid will be reduced. The resulting shortfall in the production of phosphoric
acid will be met from imports to maintain the DAP production capacity at
Mersin. Detailed analysis of various alternatives has confirmed that the
conversion of maximum possible available sulfuric acid into ammonium sulfate
and importation of part of phosphoric acid for DAP production is the most
economic alternative (Reference B1: Project File). Another important
objective of the rehabilitation project in Mersin is to eliminate the serious
environmental pollution currently caused by the nitric oxide gases emitted
from the nitric acid plant and to reduce the environmental impact of sulfur
dioxide gases emitted from the sulfuric acid plant.

3.20    The Company incurred continuous losses during 1977-79 due primarily
to low utilization of capacity resulting from shortages of imported spare
parts and raw materials. In 1979, net loss from operations reached TL 147
million as assets were revalued and higher depreciation was charged to the
income statement for that year. However, the additional equity funds (TL 428
million) plus the increase in fertilizer ex-i'actory prices and better collec-
tion of receivables from DONATIM, improved the financial position of the
Company remarkably in 1980, when net income of TL 956 million (20% of net
revenue) was earned, overdue payables to AZO1' and other local creditors of
more than TL 600 million were settled, and there was general strengthening
of the Company's liquidity as indicated by a very comfortable current ratio
of more than 2:1. Operating results in 1981 improved further with the overall
capacity utilization reaching 48%. The Compe.ny is expected to be able to
finance from internally generated funds the local cost of the Mersin subproject
(para 6.08).
C.   Ege Gubre Sanayii A.S. (EGE)
1.   History and Organization
3.21      EGE, a private sector company, was established in 1974.  Its plant
is located in Yeni Foca, on the Aegean Sea Coast, approximately 60 km northeast
of Izmir. Both management and technical offices of the Company are at the
plant site, and a commercial office is maintained in Izmir.   The Foca plant
was completed in 1978 with Haldor Topsoe (Denmark) as Technical Advisor and



- 14 -
Davy-Powergas (FRG) as engineering contractor for the process units using
Fisons (UK) process for both MAP and NP production. International Handling
(the Net:herlands) designed and constructed the storage, handling and bagging
systems. Constructions Metalliques de Provence (CPM) (France) designed and
suppliecd the ammonia storage and handling system.
3.22      The direction and management of EGE is exercised by a Board of
Directors composed of seven members and three auditors. Executive management
of the Company is vested in the General Manager who is the chief executive for
day-to-day operations. The general management is organized under three Deputy
General Managers, one technical, one financial and one purchasing. The Person-
nel Department Manager reports directly to the General Manager. Operation,
maintenance, quality control and general services departments report to the
Technical Deputy General Manager. Accounting and financial services department
reports to the Financial Deputy General Manager. The procurement department
reports to the Purchasing Deputy General Manager. The company management
is capable and experienced and is competent to implement the proposed Project.
2.   Production Performance

Capacity Utilization (%)                                -      33       43       54
3.24      The low production during the start-up year (1978) was due to
various mechanical problems necessitating design modifications. In 1979,
operat:Lons were affected mainly by shortage of raw materials and technical
problems. The existing bottlenecks and deficiencies of the plant include:
(i) limited storage capacity; (ii) inefficient premixing method used; (iii)
defective weigh belts for granulation feed streams; and (iv) moderate avail-
ability of spare parts. Under the existing conditions, the maximum attainable
capacity is only about 60% of the design. These technical bottlenecks would
be overcome under the Project, raising the capacity utilization gradually to
90%.
3.25     With the increasing demand for higher nutrient fertilizers like
DAP in Turkey, the Ministry of Agriculture has asked NP producers like EGE
to modify their product mix to include DAP. In this context, the Company
will carry out minor modifications in the existing facilities to produce DAP
or the 15-45-0 grade, a product close to DAP (18-46-0) in composition. At
present, Foca has an installed capacity to produce 306,000 tpy of NP.
After the rehabilitation, it plans to produce up to 206,000 tons in the form
of DAP/15-45-0 grades and 100,000 tons in the form of NP in line with the
consumption pattern in the region.

3.27     After an initial loss of TL 49 million at the start of its operations
in 1978, EGE has operated profitably during the last two years.  Financial
results improved substantially in 1980 partly as a result of higher fertilizer
prices fixed by the Government and partly as a result of higher capacity
utilization. The Company is in a sound financial position with a current
ratio of 2.7:1 and a debt/equity ratio of 48/52 at the end of 1980. Results
for 1981 are projected to be better as a result of higher capacity utilization.
The Company is expected to be able to finance the local cost of the proposed
sub-project from internally generated funds.
D.   Karadeniz Bakir Isletmeleri A.S. (KBI)
1.   History and Organization
3.28      KBI, a public sector company fully owned by the State, was founded
in May 1968 to process the copper mined by the Murgul Copper Works on the
Black Sea Coast. The initial paid-in capital of TL 300 million was subse-
quently increased to TL 4,000 million with ownership distributed as follows:
Etibank, 29%; Vakiflar Genel Murdurlugu, 0.3%; Treasury, 69.6% and other
public enterprises, 0.7%. KBI has its headquarters in Ankara and owns the
copper mines and concentration plants at Murgul, and the copper mines and
crushing units at Kure-Bakibaba, about 60 km from Murgul. The ore extracted
at Murgul is concentrated at site and the copper concentrate is transported
by sea to Samsun where it is smelted to produce blister copper (Map 13625R).
3.29      The direction and management of KBI is exercised by a Board of
Directors composed of five members and three auditors. Executive manage-
ment of the Company is vested in the General Manager who is the chief



- 16 -
executive for day-to-day operations. There are three deputy general managers
and a personnel manager. The plant managers at Murgul, Kure and Samsun
report to the deputy general managers. The top and middle management of the
Company consists of experienced and able personnel. Management at the plant
level in Samsun is satisfactory but needs strengthening in certain areas.
Technical advisors will help improve the Samsun operation with special atten-
tion to maaintenance and implementation of the proposed subproject (para 5.11).
3.30      KBI suffers from some problems (e.g., high turnover, low pay, lack
of cost control system, etc.) which affect the SEE's in general (para 2.04).
These problems are being addressed under the overall SEE reform as part of the
Structural Adjustment Lending. In addition, KBI, which was one of the benefi-
ciaries under the Bank-financed State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project
(Loan No. 1998-TU, April 1981) has agreed with DYB (which channeled the Bank
loan) to take a number of measures to deal with the problems. Consultants are
being financed under that loan to assist KBI in (i) developing and implementing
staff training programs; (ii) upgrading salary structures, improving selection
and promotional policies, and designing staff incentive system; (iii) improving
production control, preventive maintenance and safety systems; (iv) preparing
and implementing systems of cost accounting, standard costing, budgetary and
cost control and inventory control. In this context, KBI had agreed to submit
a time-bound program for staff training, preventive maintenance, plant safety
and management information and control systems to DYB and the Bank for review
by September 30, 1982. KBI has agreed that it will continue to comply with
the above provisions under the proposed Project.

3.32      Capacity utilization in all lines of operation of KBI, except for
pyrite production, has been low since the start of production in 1969. The
design of the Murgul concentrators is based on the supply of ore with an
average copper content of 1.31%. However, the actual copper content in the
ore supplied has been averaging between 1.05% and 1.1%. Further, as the
richer ore is committed for delivery to Etitank from the mine, the concen-
trator is fed with lower quality ore. The above factors, combined with lack
of power, water, spares and proper maintenance, has reduced the attainable
capacity to about 100,000 tpy compared to the design capacity of 208,000 tpy.
The low attainable capacity of copper concentrate at Murgul, in turn, reduces
the attainable capacity at the copper blister and sulfuric acid production
facilities at Samsun.
3.33      To debottleneck the operation of the Murgul operations of KBI, the
Bank has provided financing under the State Industrial Enterprise Finance
Project (P3057-TU, May 4, 1981). Recent studies have shown that even after
the Murgul operation are debottlenecked and ;:he supply of copper concentrate
to the copper smelter at Samsun is increased,, the smelter and the related
sulfuric acid plant at Samsun will not be ab:Le to operate at high capacity
without their rehabilitation. Therefore, the Samsun facilities of KBI have
been included for rehabilitation under the proposed Project. The sulfuric
acid produced by KBI as a by-product of the copper smelter operation is of
crucial importance to the nearby fertilizer plant of AZOT which is being
debottlenecked under Phase 1.
3.34      The KBI Samsun Complex has a design capacity. to produce 40,800 tpy
of blister copper and 330,000 tpy of sulfuric acid. The main parts of the
smelter include a drying unit by Vulcan (US), flash furnace by Outukumpo Oy
(Finland), converters by Fuller (US), heat recovery section by Workaus (Finland),
electrostatic precipitation by Lurgi (FRG), and air preheater by Schock (US).
The sulfuric acid plant based on the sulfur dioxide (SO2) gases from the
smelter was designed by Dorr-Oliver (US). In the copper smelter, the flash
furnace has been the main source of problems. KBI has examined possible
solutions and prepared a study for the rehabilitation of the cooling section
of the furnace using more advanced technology. Further, technical deficiencies
in the SO gas suction section of the sulfuriz acid plant have seriously
affected {he acid production and have also caised excessive environmental
pollution. These problems would be overcome inder the proposed Project.

a/   Net profit declined in 1981 as KBI started paying taxes after
accumulated losses from previous years were charged against income
earned during 1979-80.
3.36      KBI's financial situation has improved significantly during the
last three years. The Company showed losses during 1977-78, partly due to low
capacity utilization in its plants and partly due to low ex-factory prices
fixed by the Government. In 1979, the Government increased ex-factory prices
twice and, in 1980, the prices were further increased close to international
levels. Besides, the share capital of the Company was increased by TL 2,000
million. As a result of the above measures, the debt/equity ratio of the
Company improved markedly to 4/96 and the current ratio reached a sound level
of 2.2:1 at the end of 1980. However, in 1981 the current ratio declined to
1.4:1, still a satisfactory level, because of increased short-term borrowing
to support a higher level of operations. The Company is expected to generate
adequate internal funds to finance the local cost of the proposed sub-project.
3.   Accounting and Financial Management
3.37      As required by the complex nature of its operations, KBI employs
modern financial planning, accounting, management information and cost-control
systems. The financial statements are audited by three external auditors
selected by the shareholders and those auditors attend the Board meetings.
Audited statements of KBI, as is the practice for all SEEs, are reviewed
by the High Auditing Board of the Prime Minister-s Office. In the case of
AKGUBRE and EGE also, sound accounting and financial management systems are
used, and accounts are audited satisfactorily by external auditors approved
by shareholders. In the case of GUBRE, there is scope for improving its
accounting and financial management systems as they are still based on a



- 19 -
single-plant, single-product operation basis. GUBRE has hired a local con-
sultant to review the systems and recommend a plan of action for improvement.
GUBRE has agreed that it will implement the plan of action developed by the
consultants in consultation with the Bank, before June 30, 1983. Further,
GUBRE as well as AKGUBRE, EGE and KBI need training in long-term financial
planning. This will be carried out under the Training Component of the
Project (para 5.08).
IV. FERTILIZER MARKET, MARKETING AND PRICES
A.   Agricultural Situation
4.01      About 55% of the population of Turkey is dependent on agriculture
for its livelihood. The agricultural sector accounts for 23% of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) at factor cost. The country is largely self-
sufficient in its food and fiber requirement:s, 1/ and agricultural
commodities--particularly fruits and nuts, cotton, tobacco and wheat--are
its major exports (which accounted for 57% of total merchandise export in
1980). The ability to maintain a strong agricultural production base to
support its population of over 45 million, which is increasing at an annual
rate of 2.2%, is crucial to Turkey's development.
4.02      Since the beginning of the First Five-Year Plan in 1963, the
performance of agriculture has been satisfactory by international standards,
with an average annual growth rate of nearly 3% during 1963 have been mainly
due to expansion in the area under cultivation. Since then, because of the
limited scope for increasing further the cultivated area, the emphasis has
changed from extensive to intensive cultivation. Various government programs
have been developed to encourage intensive cultivation, including expansion
of irrigation works, mechanization, feeder road network, extension services,
farm credit, marketing infrastructure, farm price support program, and more
intensive use of agricultural inputs like fertilizers.
4.03      Of the total land area of 77.8 million hectares (ha), only 25 million
ha--a little less than one-third--are cultivated, and of that some 16.5 million
ha are sown with the rest being left fallow. Considerable efforts have been
made in the last 15 years in developing major irrigation projects. Currently,
2.8 million ha of land have access to irrigation although only 2.3 million ha
are actually irrigated. By 1995, the area under irrigation is expected to be
increased significantly. Although the use of irrigation water is not very
efficient at present (because those who have access to it often use it exces-
sively), its supply and the availability of other modern agricultural inputs
such as tractors, pesticides, high-yielding seed varieties, and fertilizer, have
created a trend towards intensive agriculture in Turkey.
4.04      Foodgrains predominate in land use, accounting for nearly 14
million ha or over 85% of the sown area. Intensively cultivated crops
like fruits and nuts, vegetables, cotton, sugar beets, sunflowers, and
tobacco occupy much less land than foodgrain:, but surpass the foodgrains
1/   Except for vegetable oils which are imported in large quantities.



- 20 -
both in terms of value of production and in terms of consumption of
modern agricultural inputs, including fertilizer. About 40% of fertilizer
consumption is now accounted for by foodgrains while the remaining 60% is
accounted for by industrial and other cash crops.

4.06      From a low base, N consumption increased at an average annual rate
of 26%, during 1965-72.  During the same period, phosphate and potash (K20)
consumption grew at average annual rates of 18.5% and 24%, respectively. The
annuaL growth, however, began tapering off after 1972. Consumption actually
declined in 1974 and was virtually stagnant in 1975 because of an increase
in fertilizer retail prices with effect from January 1, 1974. Faced with
this situation, the Government reduced the prices at the end of 1975 which
were held steady at current prices until 1979 (para 4.24)--and this resulted
in sharp increases in consumption during 1976, 1977 and 1978, except for that
of K2 0 which has remained small and has been showing an erratic trend. 1/
1/   Agronomic studies of the Government show that the soil in Turkey does not
at present levels of overall fertilizer usage need much potash except for
cash crops such as tobacco.

In 1979, nitrogenous fertilizer consumption stagnated mainly because of
supply constraints. The following year, N consumption declined by 22% because
of 250-400% increases in retail prices in February 1980 and an additional
10-40% increase in September 1980. Such decline in fertilizer consumption is
normal after sharp increases in retail prices. Experience in other countries
indicates that the consumption growth normally resumes a year or two after
such price increases in case the crop/fertilizer price ratio is still favorable
for increased fertilizer use. Accordingly, coznsumption has started to
resume its upward trend from 1981 as farmers xcealize that in spite of recent
increases in retail fertilizer prices, the ratio of fertilizer/crop prices is
still favorable for increased fertilizer application. As a matter of fact,
the N consumption in 1981 reached 776,000 tons showing a sharp increase
against previous year's total consumption of 638,000 tons. However, the
consumption in the fourth quarter of 1981 was again affected partly due to
further increases in prices and partly due to seasonal factors. The consump-
tion in the last quarter was 153,500 tons of N compared to the average of
207,500 tons of N per quarter for the first ni.ne months of 1981. Meanwhile,
capacity utilization for 1981 in the fertilizer industry increased to about
69% in 1981 compared to 53% in 1980 for nitrogenous fertilizers. The sharp
increase in capacity utilization between 1980 and 1981 is the result of
adequate availability of imported raw materials and the production build-up
in the new fertilizer plants commissioned during the last three years.
However, considering the age and uneven performance of some of the existing
plants, it is unlikely that this capacity utilization level could be sustained
during 1982-85 before the rehabilitation program begins to show its impact.
The Government underestimated the capacity utilization in 1981, and imported
more fertilizer than required leading to a temporary surplus of fertilizer
with the stock reaching 2.3 million product tons at the end of 1981 compared
to 1.9 million product tons the previous year. Turkey is trying to reduce the
stocks by exporting TSP on a temporary basis. Further, the Government is
planning to increase support prices for agricultural products and expand
agricultural credit at subsidized interest rates in 1982 to stimulate fertilizer
consumption and reduce stocks to normal levels. As the fertilizer consumption
per hectare of land is still comparatively low in Turkey (para 4.07) and as
the ratio of fertilizer/crop prices is still favorable and is expected to
improve with the higher agricultural support prices, the fertilizer consumption
is expected to increase significantly in the future.
4.07      The fertilizer use per hectare of arable land and per capita is
still comparatively low in Turkey as shown in l:he following table:

The latiest FAO statistics available show that in 1979 fertilizer consumption
per ha of arable land in Turkey was only 17% for N and 36% for P 20  of the
European average. Comparable consumption levels in 1979 in the neighboring
countries such as Greece, Italy, Yugoslavia and Romania were 2-3 times
higher for N and about twice as much for P 205
4.08      Fertilizer production has been lagging behind consumption and
considerable imports have been necessary (Annex 4-1). Imported fertilizers
since 1972 have comprised nearly 65% of the N supply, 40% of P20 , and
100% of the K20 supply.  Fertilizer imports cost Turkey US$317 million in
1979 and an estimated US$500 million in 1980. As noted, in addition to the
imported finished fertilizers, Turkey also relies on imported fertilizer
raw materials and intermediates such as phosphate rock, phosphoric acid and
sulfuric acid (which cost the country an additional US$230 million in 1980)
and most of the local production of ammonia is derived from imported hydro-
carbons. It is more economical for Turkey to import the raw materials and
produce most fertilizers domestically than to import the fertilizer itself, as
shown by the satisfactory economic rate of return of the fertilizer projects.
The recent discovery of natural gasfields, the plans for natural gas explora-
tion, and the development of the local low-grade phosphate rock and lignite
and pyrite deposits in the country, point to the potential for Turkey to
become less dependent on imports in the future (paras 2.14 and 2.15). In the
short term, however, the fertilizer industry can derive greater benefits from
the more intensive use of the existing capacity.
C.   Fertilizer Demand Projections
4.09      Available projections of N fertilizer demand in Turkey show con-
siderable divergence. The following table compares the projections made by

b/   As given in AZOT's feasibility study for the Mazidagi Fertilizer
Project prepared in 1977.
4.10      The demand forecasts prepared by AZOT in 1977 for the period
1981-87, based on a linear projection of past trends in the growth of fer-
tilizer consumption from a low base, seem ver;y optimistic. The forecasts of
the Special Commission, prepared the same year, have also proved optimistic
for the 1977-82 period. The consumption increased at an annual rate of 8%
during 1977-79, reaching 779,000 tons of N in 1979 and declined by 22% in
1980 because of sharp increases in fertilizer retail prices to farmers. The
consumption increased sharply in 1981, reaching 776,000 tons. This represents
an increase of nearly 22% over the consumption in 1980 but still marginally
lower than the consumption in 1979. As for the future, the Bank projections
assume that the consumption would increase at an annual rate of 9.6% during
1982-87 considering the country's medium-term agricultural development plan.
4.11      There is scope for increasing the sown area by reducing the fallow
area (7-8 million ha) and for increasing the area under irrigation. It is
estimated that hardly 20% of the irrigation potential has been realized so
far. Further, as noted, the application of fertilizers on cereal crops is
below the recommended levels, even though the application rates on industrial
crops are comparatively high. Therefore, there is scope for sharply increasing
the application rates on cereal crops which currently account for about 70% of
the area under cultivation but only for 40% of total fertilizer consumption.
4.12      Agronomic studies also show that the most favorable N:P ratio
for Turkey is approximately 4:3, which, in fact, is not very different
from the actual ratio already attained. Applying this ratio to the Bank
forecasts for N fertilizer needs, the following demand projections for P205
are derived:

4.13      Agronomic studies have also shown that the most suitable phosphatic
fertilizer for Turkey is diammonium phosphate (DAP), a binary fertilizer.
Therefore, as mentioned, the Government is encouraging the producers of TSP
and NP to switch over to the production of DAP. Accordingly, the old TSP
plant of GUBRE at Iskenderun, which is nearing the end of its economic life,
will be replaced by a new DAP unit and the NP plant of EGE at Foca will be'
modified to produce DAP or 15-45-0, a product close to DAP (18-46-0), in
addition to producing NP taking into consideration the product-wise demand in
the region.
4.14      Among the N fertilizers, urea and calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
are the most important fertilizers used in Turkey (Annex 4-2). However,
the ammonium sulfate (AS) use is important in certain regions where the soil
is either alkaline and/or deficient in sulfur. AS, because of its acidic
characteristic, helps neutralize the alkaline soil. Besides, farmers have
found that AS yields better results on certain crops such as cotton especially
in areas without adequate rainfall and irrigation facilities, compared to
higher--nutrient N fertilizers. In 1980, the share of AS in the total con-
sumption of N fertilizers was 18%. As for the future, it is assumed that
the percentage share would decline to around 15% considering the scope for
expanding irrigation facilities and for increased use of high nutrient
fertilizers. Based on the above assumption and the total N demand forecast of
1.14 million nutrient tons in 1985 (para 4.05), the total AS demand in 1985
is projected at 172,500 nutrient tons or 821,400 product tons. The existing
total AS production capacity of 405,000 product tons in the country accounts
for only 50% of the projected demand. Therefore, additional AS production
capacity of 220,000 product tons would be installed under the proposed project--
200,000 product tons at Mersin and 20,000 product tons at Iskenderun. At
Iskenderun, AS would be produced as a by-product while scrubbing with ammonia
the sulfur dioxide (SO2), emitted by the sulfuric acid plant to overcome the
pollution problem.
D.   Capacity and Production Forecasts
4.15      The total annual capacity of N and P 05 in the country was 364,300
tons and 575,000 tons, respectively, at the en2 of 1977. Since then, six
new projects were commissioned. With these projects in operation, the annual
capacity has increased to 928,300 tons for N and 850,000 tons for P205.



- 25 -
4.16      The production forecasts (Annex 2-1) are based on the assumption that
after the completion of the Phase I and Phase II Fertilizer Industry Ration-
alization and Energy Saving Projects in 1985-86, the capacity utilization
would gradually go up in the seven rehabilitated plants to 85-90%. In the
rest of the existing plants which do not need rehabilitation, the production
is expected to increase to 90% by 1983. These forecasts are based on the
assumption that the Government will make all the required foreign exchange
available to the fertilizer industry so that there would be no constraint for
th- import of raw materials (para 5.16).
4.17      On the basis of the above assumptions, the gross total production
of N and P 05 is expected to reach 884,000 tons and 679,000 tons, respectively,
by 1987. iowever, discounting the domestically-supplied urea which would
be used by the local NPK plants, the net production of N would be 809,000
nutrient tons in 1987 compared to 191,000 tons in 1977 and 639,000 tons in
1981.
E.   Supply/Demand Balance
4.18      The following table shows the supply/demand balance for N and
P20  fertilizers in Turkey during 1977-87:

1986                  786        1,245        459           671         934      263
1987                  809        1,365        556           679       1,024      345
The above table shows that in spite of the increasing local production, the
demand will exceed production continuously, with the deficit accounting for
about 41% and 34% for N and P205, respectively, in 1987.
F.   Input and Output Pricing
4.19      As noted previously, fertilizer production in Turkey at present
is based on naphtha and fuel oil, imported raw materials such as phosphate
rock and pyrites, and imported intermediate products such as ammonia, sulfuric
acid and phosphoric acid. Companies are allowed to import their raw materials
and intermediate products for fertilizer manu.Eacture after getting the
necessary import licenses from the Ministry oE Commerce on recommendations of
the Ministries of Industry and Agriculture.



- 26
4.20      As for domestic feedstocks (e.g., naphtha, fuel oil) for fertilizer
production, they are supplied by the local refineries which are in the public
sector. Refinery product prices are controlled by the Government with a
view to keeping the prices of products used by the low-income group (e.g.,
kerosene for lighting) at lower levels compared to the prices of products used
by the higher-income group (e.g., motor oil, lubricants, etc.) and those used
as industrial outputs. Petroleum product prices are now regularly being
adjusted to rising crude oil prices and changes in the value of the Turkish
Lira (TL). Naphtha and fuel oil used by the fertilizer industry are priced
close to international prices.
4.21      As for fertilizer product pricing, Turkey follows a system under
which ex-factory prices for fertilizer producers and the retail price for
consumers are established separately and controlled by the Government. Under
the current fertilizer pricing system, ex-factory prices for each fertilizer
plant are determined every six months based on the average CIF dollar price of
comparable products imported by DONATIM, the main fertilizer marketing agency,
during the previous six months.
4.22      The main shortcomings in this formula is that the ex-factory prices
may fluctuate widely as international input and output prices fluctuate over
a wide range. This shortcoming could be overcome by using a moving average of
interniational fertilizer prices (landed cost at Istanbul). The Government is
considering changes along these lines. Satisfactory assurances have been
obtained from the Government that it will ensure that prices for locally-
produced fertilizer will at least be comparable to the CIF landed price of
similar imports as long as the Government sets ex-factory fertilizer prices.
4.23      The ex-factory prices currently received by the fertilizer producers
are in line with CIF landed prices (para 7.02). For example, for calcium
ammonium nitrate (CAN, 26% N), the nitrogenous fertilizer most widely used
in Turkey (Annex 4-2), the CIF landed price is US$165/ton, and the local
ex-factory price is US$156/ton (6% lower).
4.24      Fertilizer retail prices are set by the Government taking into
account the cost/benefit ratio to the farmer, including the relative prices
of fertilizers and crops. However, the overriding concern in recent years
has been to keep prices of agricultural inputs, including fertilizers, at
a low level to encourage increased farm production. As a consequence,
fertilizer retail prices remained low from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s,
but increased steeply in 1974 following the quadrupling of the international
fertilizer prices. However, as noted, fertilizer retail prices were again
reduc,ed sharply in 1975, mainly to reverse the slump in consumption, and were
held at this level until 1979. In 1980 and 1981, however, to reduce the
burden of fertilizer subsidy on the budget, the Government increased retail
prices four times. The following table compares the trend of the ex-factory
and retail prices of selected fertilizers in Turkey since 1972 for CAN and
urea, the two important N fertilizers used:

a/   There was no local urea production facility until 1977.
4.25      The following table compares the prices and subsidy on imported
and local CAN and urea:

Despite the increases in retail prices during 1980-81, the subsidy element
is still high. For example, in 1981, the fai^mers fertilizer subsidies on
imported CAN and urea were about 50% and 38% respectively.
4.26      The total amount of compensation payment on account of fertilizers
was over US$500 million in 1980. Under Structural Adjustment lending, the
Government has agreed to gradually phase out the subsidies for agricultural
products and inputs, including fertilizers, but recognizes that such phasing
of subsidies would have to be gradual over the next five years in order to
avoid an adverse impact on agricultural outputt or fertilizer use. Along with
the elimination of fertilizer subsidies, the Government, over the long term,
intends to allow producers to set ex-factory prices on the basis of market
forces. The Government's strategy regarding fertilizer pricing and farmers
fertilizer subsidies will be analyzed under the fertilizer marketing and
pricing study financed under Phase I (para 4.37).

G.   Fertilizer Marketina and Distribution
1.   Distribution System
4.27      To ensure orderly distribution in as wide an area as possible and
also to prevent black marketing during the periods caused from time-to-time by
inadequate foreign exchange to meet the full demand, fertilizer distribution
is done through two public sector companies--DONATIM and Turkiye Seker
Fabrikalari A.S. (Turkish Sugar Company, SEKER).  DONATIM is by far the
largest fertilizer distributor accounting for about 90% of the fertilizer--
both local and imported--distributed in the country. SEKER accounts for the
rest (10%) of the fertilizer distribution and is also responsible for the
production and marketing in Turkey of sugar (mostly based on sugar beets) and
its by-products. DONATIM and SEKER are also the only authorized fertilizer
importers.
4.28      DONATIM is a State Economic Enterprise (SEE) under the Ministry
of Agriculture. It is autonomous in its basic function of supplying the main
agricultural inputs to farmers, including fertilizers, pesticides and high-
yielding seeds as well as animal feed and farm equipment. It also manufactures
farm equipment (e.g., tractors) and warehouse structures (e.g., steel frames).
It has a staff of 5,000 and operates through its headquarters in Ankara and 22
regional offices and 300 branches. The branches, in turn, work through about
3,100 dealers, mostly cooperatives. The main departments of DONATIM are: (i)
commercial (purchasing and distribution); (ii) agricultural affairs; (iii)
agricultural equipment; (iv) manufacturing; and (v) accounting. The agricul-
tural affairs department has separate divisions dealing with the distribution
of fertilizers, pesticides, seeds and animal feeds. The fertilizer division
is responsible for determining the country's requirements, examining sources
of supply including imports, ensuring stock control, storage and distribution
and in helping the Government determine ex-factory and retail fertilizer
prices. DONATIM is not involved in sales promotion and extension services.
These services are provided by the Ministry of Agriculture's extension services
which are fairly widespread in Turkey.
4.29      Fertilizer sales have accounted for 30-50% of DONATIM's sales in
recent years, and this activity absorbs a major portion of its manpower. The
volume of fertilizers distributed by DONATIM has increased from about 535,000
product tpy in 1972 to 2.5 million tpy of product. Complete financial data
are not available for DONATIM. On fertilizer sales, it loses heavily. These
losses, to be compensated by the Government, occur because the fertilizer
retail prices (fixed by the Government) are much lower than DONATIM-s purchase
pric,e of local and imported fertilizers plus transportation and distribution
costs. Since government compensation payments to cover the difference in the
past were not made in time, DONATIM has itself been slow in making payments to
fertilizer producers, creating a working capital problem for the producers who
have to rely on short-term borrowings with interest rates around 50% to meet
their cash requirements.



- 29 -
4.30      For companies importing raw materials and spares under the Bank's
Structural Adjustment Loan, the Government has been making local currency
funds available from the Budget against receivables of those companies from
DONATIM, to buy the necessary foreign exchan,e. Further, the Government has
been consolidating the receivables and payables of fertilizer and petroleum
companies and DONATIM from time to time. Under the present system, funds are
to be made available to DONATIM and SEKER from the Price Stabilization Fund
(PSF) to cover the difference between the fertilizer price it buys from the
producers and the price at which it sells to farmers through DONATIM and
SEKER. Money for PSF comes from part of agr:Lcultural export earnings, i.e.,
from a levy on the export earnings from key agricultural commodities. (The
levy is based upon the margin between the international and local support
prices for those commodities.) In addition, the inventory gains of traders
and producers due to changes in official prices are to be credited to PSF.
Though theoretically all inventory profit is to go to PSF, the actual
collection is only a part of the total. Further, PSF is used to make com-
pensation payments for a number of products. Therefore, PSF does not always
have the resources it needs for its payment to DONATIM.
4.31      The Government has recently taken measures to settle the receivables
of fertilizer companies from DONATIM and SEKER outstanding for more than four
months. Further, agreement was reached under Phase I with the Government that
it will review the operation of the PSF under the proposed Fertilizer Marketing
and Pricing Study, and adopt administrative procedures that will ensure
release of compensation payments to distributors within a reasonable period of
presentation of sales invoices so that the distributors will be able to pay
the producers within at least four months of sales. Over the medium term, as
fertilizer subsidies are eliminated (para 4.26), DONATIM would be able to
have the required funds to pay producers, since it will not have to rely on
payments from the PSF.
4.32      So far, DONATIM has been doing a fairly good job in the physical
distribution of fertilizers through its network of outlets developed for the
distribution of not only fertilizers but also other agricultural inputs.
However, as it handles increasing amounts of fertilizers and other products,
it will need to continually appraise its efficiency and effectiveness in
serving its suppliers and customers, the Turkish farmers. Particularly, it
will need to review its dealer network with a view to appointing more private
dealers and establishing adequate retail outlets at convenient locations.
This will, in turn, require that its warehousLng capacity be adequately
expanded, warehouses be strategically located and stocked with the right
products, and these products be lifted from the producers continuously and be
made available to farmers in a timely manner without straining the truck
industry-s capacity to cope with the demand for services in the peak season.
Inability of DONATIM to lift the fertilizer produced by local plants at times
causes production stoppages, as there is limited storage space at the plants.
DONATIM should also consider ways of making greater use of rail and sea



- 30 -
transportation. Also, in a virtual monopoly situation where there is no
competition, costs could get out of hand, and the need for government com-
pensation payments increases, thus straining government resources. Therefore,
DONATIM needs to pay increased attention to effective financial management
and explore methods to reduce transportation and warehousing costs and
improve handling efficiency. In this context, as subsidies are eliminated
and retail prices reach international levels, the Government could consider
introducing competition in fertilizer distribution by allowing fertilizer
producers to distribute part or all of their products as the gap between
demand and supply narrows with increasing local production. These matters
require the carrying out of a comprehensive review of the sector which is
being done under the ongoing Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study.
2.   Warehousing
4.33      DONATIM has covered storage for over 1.5 million tons of fertilizer
accounting for about 46% of its current sales. DONATIM is currently imple-
menting a plan to increase its warehousing capacity by building new ware-
houses and/or hiring storage space from private companies in order to raise
the total capacity to 4 million tons of bagged fertilizers. (It does not
normally handle bulk fertilizers.) The warehouses are located at main ports
of entry for imported fertilizers, near fertilizer marketing plants, and at
the branch offices. These warehouses are basic modules of 1,500-ton capacity
each. Each warehouse has at least two such modules. The construction of
additional warehouse capacity is concentrated in potential areas of increased
fertilizer as well as the progress made in implementing the warehousing
expansion plan will be reviewed by the Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing
Study (para 4.37).
3.   Credit
4.34      The main source of both general agricultural credit and credit for
ferti'Lizer is T.C. Ziraat Bankasi (TCZB), the Agricultural Bank of Turkey.
Fertilizer credit has generally been 15% and 20% of all agricultural credit
extended by TZCB. Since 1970, agricultural credit has been growing rapidly
at over 30% per year. Part of the growth is due to the refinancing of
uncollected previous credits. The collection rate for agricultural credit
has improved from 45% in 1970 to about 70% at present but is still low.
4.35      TCZB finances the fertilizer requirements as determined by the
agronomists it maintains in most of its branch offices. TCZB has 900 branch
offices of which 800 make agricultural and fertilizer loans (the other 100
providing banking and commercial services) and has been in existence for
135 years. Credits are usually rolled over when circumstances beyond the
control of the farmer make it impossible for him to repay the loan. Legal
action is taken only when the farmer has the financial ability to repay
but does not do so.
4.36      The availability of credit for fertilizers does not at present
appear to be a significant constraint to fertilizer consumption in Turkey.
Besides TCZB, other institutions--such as SEKER--also provide credit for
fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. Further, as noted, the Government
is planning to expand the fertilizer credit at more favorable terms as a
means to stimulate fertilizer consumption and bring down the fertilizer
stocks to normal levels.



- 31 -
4.   Ongoing Marketing and Pricing Stuly
4.37      Though the present fertilizer marlceting and distribution system
through DONATIM and SEKER has shortcomings, the Government believes that
there is need to continue it as long as the country s domestic supply of
fertilizers falls short of demand. Further!, the present distributors have
a network of dealers and warehousing facilities in various parts of the
country developed for not only fertilizers but also other agricultural
inputs they distribute. Considering the various issues in the fertilizer
pricing, distribution and marketing system, an agreement was reached with
the Government under the Phase I project that a Fertilizer Marketing and
Pricing Study will be carried out.  Accordingly, the Government invited
bids from prequalified firms and selected itl December 1981 a consortium of
TUMAS, a local firm, and DARUDEC, a Dutch firm, to carry out the study.
Following the study, the Government has agreed to prepare and furnish to the
Bank by June 30, 1983 a detailed plan for carrying out the recommendations of
the study and implement the plan by June 30, 1984 in consultation with the
Bank.
V. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope and Objectives
5.01      The Project represents the second phase of Turkey-s program to
improve the performance of the fertilizer sector through rehabilitation and
modernization of selected fertilizer and related plants. It consists of three
components: (i) rehabilitation of the existing complexes of three companies
to remove capacity-limiting bottlenecks and improve operational efficiency by
energy and feedstocks-saving measures and engineering design of similar
investments for a fourth company (Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Component);
(ii) expansion of training facilities of the four companies to ensure
availability of necessary skilled staff to operate and maintain plant
facilities (Training Component); and (iii) a fertilizer raw material resource
study (Study Component).
B.   Project Description
1.   Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Component
5.02      The Rehabilitation and Energy Saviag Component covers four complexes
belonging to four companies: the Iskenderun Complex of GUBRE, the Mersin
Complex of AKGUBRE, the Foca facilities of EGE, and the Samsun plant of KBI.
The background to and rationale for rehabilitating these facilities is dis-
cussed in Chapter III.
5.03      Iskenderun Complex:  The preliminar-y rehabilitation requirements of
the Iskenderun Complex were jointly identified by Heurtey (France) and GUBRE.
The works to be carried out as a part of the proposed Project (Reference BI:
Project File) will cover basic and detailed engineering work for: (i) the
addition of a new 660 tpd DAP unit along with necessary offsites; (ii) the

rehabi:Litation of the existing sulfuric and phosphatic acid plants; (iii) the
instalLation of additional facilities to reduce air and water pollution and to
produce ammonium sulfate while scrubbing with ammonia the sulfur dioxide gases
which are currently vented to the atmosphere from the stack of the sulfuric
acid plant; and (iv) expanding the storage facilities for raw materials and
intermoediate products to increase operational flexibility. The engineering
will provide the basis for the rehabilitation and modernization of the
Iskenderun Complex. In addition, spare parts will be provided to improve
capacity utilization. GUBRE, which is currently implementing the rehabilita-
tion of its Yarimca plant, has indicated that it intends to proceed with the
rehabilitation of its Iskenderun plant during 1985-88 following the completion
of engineering and design included under the proposed Project.
5.04      Mersin Complex:  The rehabilitation requirement of the Mersin
Complex were identified by AKGUBRE with the help of Heurtey (France)
and Davy International (FRG), successor of the original designer/contractor
for the nitric acid, the phosphoric acid and DAP units. The work to be
covered as a part of the proposed Project (Reference B2: Project File)
includes: (i) addition of a new 600-tpd ammonium sulfate unit; (ii) rehabilita-
tion of the existing sulfuric acid plant to improve the capacity utilization,
and control air pollution from sulfuric dioxide (SO2) gases by replacing
old mist eliminators with new and more efficient ones, by installing an
electric-driven standby SO2 blower, and by extending the height of the stack;
(iii) rehabilitation of the existing phosphoric acid plant, especially by
changing the concentration exchangers; (iv) major overhaul of the existing
nitric acid plant by: (a) replacement of reactor waste heat boiler section to
meet process parameters and to overcome the corrosion problem; (b) installation
of new absorption devices to reduce to acceptable levels nitrogen oxide (NOx)
concentration in the tail gases emitted to the atmosphere and also to increase
efficiency of the absorption system; (c) replacement/overhaul of heat
exchangers; and (d) overhaul of the turbo-compressor; (v) rehabilitation of
the CAN and DAP plants to improve their on-stream efficiency and product
quality; (vi) improvement and expansion of the unloading and storage facilities
for solid and liquid (phosphoric acid) inputs; and (vii) installation of a new
back pressure turbo-generator to facilitate energy saving in the Complex.
When these works are completed, the capacity utilization in the existing
facilities is expected to increase from 50% to 90%. In addition, the Project
will add 180,000 tpy of ammonium sulfate production, increase intermediate
product supply significantly and save or generate 4.8 MW of power.
5.05      Foca Plant:  The requirements of the Foca Plant were identified
by the plant management with the help of Heurtey. The works to be carried out
as part of the Project (Reference B3: Project File) include: (i) installation
of a new premixing unit for the granulation plant to improve production
capacity by decreasing the recycle rate in the granulator; (ii) the addition
of a 5,000-ton bulk storage for finished products; (iii) installation of weigh
belts for granulator feed streams to replace the existing electronically-
controlled system, which is not functioning properly under the present dusty
and acid-fume laden environment; (iv) mechanical modifications to allow



- 33 -
operational flexibility and to produce DAP or 15-45-0 1/ fertilizer in addition
to the 20-20-0 (NP) product it is currently producing; and (v) adoption of
measures to prevent air pollution from MAP and NP plants. At the completion of
the Project, the capacity utilization of the Foca Complex is expected to
increase from 60% to 90%.
5.06      Samsun Complex:  The Samsun Complex of KBI, which consists of
a copper smelter and a sulfuric acid plant (based on smelter gases), has
been experiencing inadequate copper concentrate supply from the KBI Copper
Concentrator Works at Murgul, near Samsun, due to serious operational tech-
nical problems there. To debottleneck the Muzgul operations of KBI, the Bank
provided financing under the State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project
(P3057-TU, May 4, 1981). Subsequent studies by KBI showed that the KBI
facilities at Samsun also need debottlenecking to increase the production of
blister copper and sulfuric acid. The rehabilitation of the Samsun Complex
is included under the proposed Project since increased supply of sulfuric
acid from it is of critical importance to increase fertilizer production at
the adjacent AZOT plant which is being rehabilitated under Phase I of the
Fertilizer Industry Rationalization and Energy Saving Project. The work to
be carried out at the Samsun Complex under the Phase 11 Project (Reference B4:
Project File) covers: (i) revamping of the existing copper smelter through
modifications in the concentrate dryer, flash furnace, electric precipitators,
and dust recycle conveyors and the plant air system; (ii) modifications in the
gas suction, scrubbing and heat recovery sections of the sulfuric acid plant;
(iii) improvements in the electric supply system by adding new voltage
compensators and a new underground connection line to overcome the corrosion
problem at the overhead high-voltage aerial line, and (iv) relocation of the
existing water pumping station since present site will be under water after
the proposed Cakmak dam is built.
5.07      The following table summarizes the main benefits from the
Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Component:
1/   Agronomic Studies by the Ministry of Agriculture have shown that DAP
is one of the most suited fertilizers for rurkey. Further there is
surplus capacity for NP in the country.  Ia this context, modification
of the NP plant at Foca to produce DAP or 15-45-0, a product close to
DAP, has been found feasible.

c/ But for the sulfuric acid plant only 35%.
t/ NP production goes down because the Foca plant would be modified to use two-
thirds of its capacity to produce 15-45-0/DAP.
The Project will increase annual fertilizer production by about 630,000 tons
and copper blister production by 10,000 tons. It will also help increase
substantially production of intermediates for fertilizer production.
Further, because of the decrease in specific material consumption per ton of
product after rehabilitation, there will be significant savings especially in
the consumption of pyrites, rock phosphate, ammonia, sulfuric acid and
phosphoric acid. As a result, the unit cost of production would decline
considerably. For example, the unit cost of DAP and CAN (two important



- 35 -
products produced under the Project) would decrease by about 10%. Besides,
there would be significant power generation and/or energy savings, especially
at the Mersin and Foca complexes, valued at about US$3 million per year at
1981 prices.
2.   Training Component
5.08      The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is financing a training
center at Kutahya near the AZOT fertilizer complex there. This training
center is designed to meet the training needs of AZOT and, to the extent
possible, of the other fertilizer companies as well. Presently, none of the
Companies under the proposed Project have facilities for training. Although
the Kutahya Training Center will be available to meet part of the training
needs of the plants, there is a need for establishing training facilities at
the plants for basic on-the-job training.  Therefore, provision has been made
in the Project for US$4.1 million mainly fort (i) development of training
programs; (ii) training of selected personnel; and (iii) equipment and training
aids required for the proposed training faciLities at the four complexes
included under the Project. In addition, some foreign experts would be
brought in to organize training in critical areas, i.e., preventive and opera-
tional maintenance, etc., and selected local personnel will be sent abroad for
specialization.  Agreement has been reached with the Companies that the training
program will be developed and implemented after approval by the Bank.
3.   Study Component
5.09      As noted, the Project will include the Fertilizer Raw Material
Resource Study which will: (i) review available information on all the local
fertilizer raw material resources in Turkey with special reference to rock
phosphate, pyrites, lignite, natural gas, etc.; (ii) examine the size and
quality of these reserves and identify promising deposits for development on a
priority basis; (iii) recommend additional steps necessary to firm up the
reserve estimates and their quality; (iv) analyze the infrastructure avail-
ability near those deposits; and (v) recommend the best uses for those deposits.
This study will also examine the utilization of pyrite cinders, the disposal of
which is a problem in sulfuric acid plants based on pyrites. The study is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1984 and will provide the basis for a
master plan for the development of the fertilizer industry in Turkey based
primarily on local resources.
C.   Project Management
5.10      Project implementation for each plaat will be the responsibility
of the individual companies owning these plants. The Companies have already
formed project teams with experienced engineers. In the case of GUBRE, whose
Yarimca Complex is being debottlenecked under the Phase I Project, a central
project team at the headquarters has been already established. This team
will also deal with the proposed work at the GUBRE's Iskenderun Complex which
is included under the proposed Phase II Project. In addition, the Technical



- 36 -
Advisers appointed by GUBRE by the end of 1981 under Phase I, will also deal
with Phase II, and provide technical assistance for improving operation and
maintenance of the Yarimca and Iskenderun plants. WJBRE as well as AKGUBRE,
EGE and KBI will appoint project teams at the plant level to work full-
time on project implementation. Agreement has been reached with GUBRE, AKGUBRE,
EGE and KBI that they will maintain adequately staffed full-time project teams
to manage the Project during its implementation.
5.11      Procurement of equipment and materials will be handled by the
project teams with the assistance of technical advisors, engineering con-
tractors and existing procurement organizations of the companies concerned.
KBI needs technical advisors to improve its existing operations and deal with
project implementation.  Therefore, as a condition of disbursement of its loan
portion, KBI will hire at least three experts--one for operation, one for
maintenance, and one for project implementation. AKGUBRE, as a condition of
disbursement of its loan portion, will hire at least one expert for project
implementation. (Similar arrangements are not required for EGE as this
company does not require technical assistance for operation and implementa-
tion.)
5.12      Implementation of the Fertilizer Raw Material Resource Study will
be carried out by the Mining Research and Development Institute (MTA), which
has an extensive data base for such a study. Foreign specialists in mining,
transportation and processing will be required to supplement the MTA task
force to be organized for the study. Since the study will involve other State
Economic Enterprises such as Etibank (for rock phosphate and pyrites), the
Turkish Coal Authority (TKI, for lignite) and the Turkish Petroleum Company
(TPA0, for natural gas), the Government shall make administrative arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank for coordination of the study.  It is intended that
the study will be supervised by SPO by expanding the Project Unit established
under Loan 1985-TU to supervise the Fertilizer Marketing and Pricing Study by
at least two professional staff members, and the Coordination Committee
established to deal with that Study will also deal with the Fertilizer Raw
Material Resource Study.
D.   Project Schedule
5.13      The project schedules for the plants are determined by two factors:
(i) the speed with which the Companies can finalize the engineering arrange-
ments for each individual plant; and (ii) the need to carry out the modifica-
tions with minimum production interruptions and, therefore, mostly during
scheduled annual maintenance. From the date of engineering contracts to
completion, Iskenderun would take 15 months for completion; Mersin, 37 months;
Foca, 30 months; and Samsun, 35 months. The engineering contracts are expected
to be signed for all the plants by August 31, 1982. Project implementation
schedules are given in Annex 5-1.



- 37 -
E.   Environmental Aspects
5.14      Presently, the plants included in the Project have severe pollu-
tion problems.  In KBI's Samsun plant, the SO 2 content of the stack gases
ranges between 30,000 ppm and 50,000 ppm, whereas the design calls for 1,400
ppm. Because of this serious environmental pollution, the Company pays every
year about US$1 million to farmers in damages to crops grown in the vicinity.
The problem would be overcome under the Project by improving performance
of sulfuric acid unit.  In Iskenderun, although SO2 pollution is not as
serious as in Samsun, the topography of the area and the proximity to
population centers necessitate the reduction of the SO2 content of the
stack gases from the present level of 2,000 ppm. The engineering work under
the Project will cover the measures necessary to reach an exceptionally low
level of SO emissions (100 ppm) by scrubbing the stack gases with ammonia
during whici about 20,000 tons of AS would be produced as a by-product. In
addition, engineering work will be carried out for significant reduction in
liquid pollution by installing closed drains of phosphoric and DAP spouts and
a liquid effluent treatment system; such modifications will also result in
reduction of products losses. In Foca, the pollution problem from excessive
quantities of dust discharged from the MAP arLd NP units will be resolved by
installing a scrubbing section. This will also help recover part of the
fertilizer nutrients (e.g. from ammonia and jhosphoric acid) currently lost in
the excessive dust. In Mersin, the level of nitric oxide (NOx) emitted by the
nitric acid plant is as high as 2,500 ppm. This will be reduced to less than
700 ppm under the Project by installing the necessary anti-pollution equipment.
The environmental impact of sulfur dioxide emissions from sulfuric acid stack
will be reduced by improving the performance of the plant and by increasing
the stack height. Thus the reduction of pollution at the four plant sites to
acceptable levels will be an important part of the Project. Agreement has
been reached with the Government and the Companies that the Project will be
carried out with adequate attention to pollution control.
F.   Raw Materials and Utilities
5.15      Three of the four plants included uader the Project (i.e., Iskenderun,
Mersin and Foca) depend heavily on imported raw materials. In the past, one
of the constraints for increasing the capacityr utilization in those plants was
inadequate supply of imported raw materials due to foreign exchange diffi-
culties. However, the Bank's Structural Adju;tment Loans have improved the
situation as part of those loans are used to Lmport fertilizer raw materials
and spares (para 2.09).
5.16      The requirements of main imported raw materials and intermediate
products before and after rehabilitation/modernization are shown below:

Note: B - Before rehabilitation
A - After rehabilitation
I - Incremental requirements
The table shows that after rehabilitation the requirements of rock phosphate,
sulfuric acid and urea would actually decline by following the most economic
approach to production through necessary modifications/rationalizations under
the Project. However, the need for imported pyrites, phosphoric acid and
ammonia would increase significantly. The Government has agreed that adequate
foreign exchange will be made available to Iskenderun, Mersin and Foca plants
to meet their full requirements of imported raw materials and intermediate
products.
5.17      As for power, the present power supply system is adequate to meet
the needs after rehabilitation at Foca. At Mersin, about 2.5 MW of power will
be produced using surplus steam from the existing sulfuric acid and nitric
acid plants, thus helping the Mersin Complex reduce its dependence on outside
power supply. At Samsun, power supply from the national grid is adequate but
the overhead power transmission line between the nearby TEK substation and the
plant are corroded and the line would not be able to cope with the additional
power load (3 MW) required after rehabilitation. Further, frequent voltage
fluctuations occur. To overcome these problems, a new underground power
supply line between the substation and the plant will be installed, and an
automatic voltage compensator will be added.
5.18      The water supply system at Iskenderun, Mersin and Foca is adequate
to meet the requirements of those plants after rehabilitation. As a matter
of fact, the water requirement at Mersin facilities would be reduced by about
20%, under the Project, by improving the water balance of those facilities and



- 39 -
by recycling water. Water supply is a prob:Lem at Samsun especially during the
summer months. Therefore, KBI is participating in financing an earthen dam on
the Abdal River being implemented by DSI (Turkish Water Works). This dam,
which is expected to cost TL 3 billion (US$25 million equivalent) mostly in
local currency, is scheduled to be completed in 1985/86. The dam is of
critical importance not only for the KBI plant but also for the nearby AZOT
fertilizer complex, which is being rehabilil:ated with Bank funds under the
Phase I project, and for meeting the growing needs of the Samsun City.
The new jam will help augment tMe water supply in the Samsun region
by 4.i m /second of which 0.3 m /sec will be supplied to the KBI plant and
0.4 m /sec to the AZOT fertilizer plant. The engineering contract for the dam
is expected to be awarded by September 30, 1982 and the dam is scheduled to be
completed by June 30, 1986. The facilities of KBI and AZOT will, however,
start receiving water from the reservoir on a priority basis from mid-1984,
two years before the dam completion.  Satisfactory agreement has been reached
with the Government and KBI that water supply arrangements will be carried out
in accordance with the agreed schedule.
G.   Employment and Productivity
5.19      Since the Project is basically a rehabilitation/modification of
the existing plants, the additional employment created will be limited to
about 200, consisting of additional personnel who will be hired for the new
AS plant at Mersin, and for additional unloading, handling and shipping
operations following rehabilitation of plants included under the Project.
After rehabilitation, the labor productivity in those plants is expected to
increase substantially, partly as a result of the Training Component of the
Project which will strengthen and expand the training programs of the Companies
concerned.
VI. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost
6.01      The total financing required for the Fertilizer Industry Rationali-
zation and Energy Saving Project - Phase II is estimated at US$85.5 million,
including US$55.3 million in foreign exchange. The capital cost estimates are

I/ The costs expressed in TL have been calculated from US$ cost using an exchange rate of TL 143.7 - US$1. The
Project is exempt from custom duties and taxes on imported equipment. Taxes (US$1.5 million equivalent) on
local supplies are included.
2/ Including physical and price contingencies.
3/ Initial working capital for 1986-87, including price contingencies.
6.02         The base cost estimates are in December 1981 prices and are based on
the Companies' detailed estimates prepared by the engineering firms.   Physical
contingencies are calculated at 10% of the base cost estimates. Price escala-
tion for foreign costs are based on the projected increases in international
prices in dollar terms of 8.5% in 1982 and 7.5% in 1983-85 and 6% in 1986 and
onwards. The same international rates have been used for local equipment and
materials, and civil works, erection and other services assuming that the
difference in the domestic and international rates will be accounted for by
adjustments in the foreign exchange rate in accordance with the Government
policy. Incremental working capital requirements are estimated at US$4.5
million equivalent, excluding the cost of spare parts for two years included
under the Project.

fees, and working capital) is estimated to be needed for the Rehabilitation
Component, and the remaining 11% for the Training and Study Components. The
Project includes US$6 million for about 460 man-months of services by
foreign specialists. The average cost of these services including subsistence
expenses is estimated at about US$13,000/man-month.

Total (A + B)                          30.2       55.3        85.5
6.06      The Project would be financed with 52% debt and the remaining
48% by equity. The proposed Bank loan of US$44.1 million will cover nearly
80% the total foreign exchange requirements. The foreign exchange requirements
to meet mainly the working capital requirements and part of the interest
during construction, amounting to US$11.2 million will be covered from foreign
exchange sources of the Government.
6.07      Among the Bank loan beneficiaries are one private sector, two joint
sector, and one public sector companies. The loan portion for the private and
joint sector companies will be channeled through the Industrial Development
Bank of Turkey (TSKB) while the loan portion to the public sector company will
be channeled through the State Investment Bank (DYB). TSKB will arrange for
commercial banks to' share with it the credit risk by providing guarantees on
the loan portion for the private and joint sector companies. Under this
arrangement, financial intermediaries would be responsible for administering
and supervising the subloans and together with the commercial banks, share the
crediLt risk in case of default by the subborrowers. (In case of default by
the financial intermediaries, the Government would remain obligated to repay
the loan.)
6.08      Among the financial intermediaries, TSKB, which was established in
1950, is one of the oldest and most experienced development finance companies
developed with assistance from the Bank Group. It can lend only to private
and majority private sector firms. The principal shareholder is Turkiye Is
Bankasi, Turkey's largest private commercial bank, which together with its
pension fund owns 39% of the capital of TSKB. The remainder is owned as
follows: 46% by 11 Turkish private sector institutions, 12% by private
individuals and 3% by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). TSKB has
an experienced and competent management team. While its portfolio has been
adversely affected by disruptions in the Turkish economy over the past few



- 43 -
years, it has mounted a program for dealing with the situation; which will be
monitored under the Export-Oriented Industries Project approved by tile Boa.d
in February 1982 (Loan No. 2093-TU).
6.09      The other proposed intermediary, the State Thvestment Bank (DYB),
was established in 1964 to provide long-term credits and other services to
SEEs. DYB itself is a SEE reporting to the Ministry of Finance. As part of
Turkey's structural adjustment program, the Government Aas decided to increase
DYB-s role in appraising the viability of SEE investment projects and in
supervising their implementation. Starting from the current fiscal year, all
foreign exchange loans contracted by the Government for SEEs are b.ing made
.a.la. - zhrou;L - _
b.10      The Bank loan would be extended to the drkish Government for 17
years including four years of grace at the prevailing rate of interest. The
Turkish Government would onlend the amount allocated to private and joint
sector companies--EGE, GUBRE and AKGUBRE--through TSKB and to the public
sector company, KBI, through DYB. Accordingly, of the total Bank loan of
US$44.1 million, the Government will retain U:3$1.83 million for the two
studies (paras 5.09 and 5.10), and onlend US$34.35 million through TSKB and
the remaining US$7.92 million will be channeled through DYB. The amount of
the loan to be channeled by TSKB to EGE is small (US$2.97 million) but the
loans to be channeled to AKGUBRE and GUBRE are fairly large (totalling US$31.38
million).  To reduce the exposure of TSKB on those loans, TSKB will provide
guarantees to the Government for only US$9.41 million (30% of the total for
AKGUBRE and GUBRE) plus for US$2.97 million for EGE, while arranging counter-
guarantees from the commercial banks for the remaining US$21.97 million.
Agreement has been reached with the Government: that in case of default by a
beneficiary company, if one or more of the conmmercial banks should fail to
honor their guarantee, the Government would not have recourse to TSKB for the
amount due from the commercial banks. The terms for onlending by the financial
intermediaries to the beneficiary companies will be 12 years, including four
years of grace. Private and joint sector companies (EGE, GUBRE and AKGUBRE)
will have the choice between fixed interest be.sed on the Bank lending rate plus
5.5 percentage points, or variable interest r.te, adjusted every six months
based on the average rate on all TSKB's borrowing plus 5.5 percentage points.
Such Companies will be eligible for a 25% interest rebate provided by the
Government for priority private and joint sector investments. KBI, the public
sector company, will pay interest to DYB based upon the Bank lending rate plus
3.5 percentage points. The Companies will take the foreign exchange risk and
pay the front-end fee on Bank loan. Signing cf subsidiary Loan Agreements
between the Government and the financial intermediaries (TSKB and DYB) and the
Finance Agreements between the financial intermediaries and the Companies, and
satisfactory agreements for the commercial bank guarantees will be conditions
of Bank loan effectiveness.
6.11      All of the Companies are considered capable of meeting their local
currency expenditures from internal cash generation as the plant of these
companies are operating at a higher capacity than many other plants in Turkey
and, under the current ex-factory pricing policy, their cash flow situation is
expected to remain sound in the future as well. If the internally generated
funds are inadequate for the equity financing of these subprojects and/or if
the Project should experience a cost increase, the Companies are expected to
borrow and/or increase their share capital within a maximum overall 60/40



- 44 -
debt/equity ratio and a minimum 1.5 times debt service coverage. Satisfactory
assurances have been obtained from the Government that adequate access to
foreign exchange will be provided for necessary funds to complete the Project.
Further, assurances were reconfirmed from the Government that so long as the
Govermnent regulates ex-factory prices of fertilizer, prices will be set at
levels at least comparable to the CIF landed prices of similar imports
(para 7.02).
C.   Procurement
6.12      International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for all equip-
ment and materials, except for US$10 million of proprietary and critical items
as well as small items each costing US$150,000 or less (totalling about US$2
million), to be procured under limited international tendering (except for
proprietary items which would be procured on a negotiated basis). Local
suppliers, for purposes of bid evaluation under ICB, will receive a preference
of 15% or the amount of the customs duty, whichever is lower.
6.13      Civil engineering, civil works, erection contracts and some equipment
expected to be procured locally will be financed by the Companies with Turkish
Lira funds. Contracts for civil works and erection services will be awarded
under procedures acceptable to the Bank including prequalification and/or
purchase orders will be awarded after competitive bidding among local
contractors and/or suppliers. The capabilities of selected local contractors
and suppliers are considered adequate for timely and efficient completion of
this part of the works.
6.14      Considering the urgency of implementing the rehabilitation project
as quickly as possible, the Companies (particularly AKGUBRE and KBI) plan to
sign contracts with technical advisors by April 1982 after Bank approval.
These contracts will be reviewed with the Bank prior to signature. In addi-
tion, some amounts have been spent for engineering studies to complete project
preparation. Further, the Companies plan to import under Bank procurement
guidelines certain critical equipment on a priority basis to overcome technical
problems. Therefore, the Government and Companies have requested that the
Bank consider retroactive financing of engineering studies and of downpayments
in foreign exchange made to engineering firms and equipment suppliers prior to
the signing of the loan. Retroactive financing up to US$2 million for expendi-
tures incurred after August 1, 1981, is recommended.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.15      The Bank loan will be allocated as indicated in the following
table:

6.16       Local firms are expected to win about US$5 million of equipment and
services under international competitive bidding. For expenditures eligible
for Bank financing, disbursements would cover 100% of foreign expenditures for
imported equipment, materials and spares 1/; ]00% of the foreign cost of
consulting services by foreign consultants or, in case local consultants
should be awarded the contracts, 57% of the ccsts of services for the Rehabil-
itation Component and 70% for the Study Comporent; 100% of the ex-factory
cost of equipment supplies by local firms winning under international competi-
tion (excluding local taxes); and 100% of the foreign cost of training.
The disbursement profile for the Project (Annex 6-2) differs from the standard
profile for industrial projects as the proposed project is a rehabilitation
project, the extent of civil works and erection work involved is limited, and
the implementation period for this Project is considerably less than for a
greenfield industrial project. Disbursements are expected to be completed by
June 30, 1987.
1/   According to Turkish regulations, equipment and materials have to be
transported in Turkish ships. Therefore, freight costs will not be
eligible for Bank financing.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A. Project Revenues
7.01      The financial analysis of the sub-projects is done in current terms
in US$ and the major assumptions, detailed in Annexes 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3, are
summarized below.
7.02      As noted earlier, the ex-factory fertilizer prices are set by the
Government every six months in consultation with the local producers and the
main fertilizer marketing agency, DONATIM, and are based on the import prices
paid by DONATIM for finished fertilizers during the previous six months. The
following table shows the average prices for the first half of 1981 for
products of GUBRE, AKGUBRE and EGE:
TURKEY - Ex-factory Prices as of June, 1981 a/

a/  These prices are also the temporary prices for the second half of
1981. Actual prices for this period have not been fixed yet.
b/  Before import duties.
The ex-factory prices currently received by the producers in Turkey are more
or less in line with the CIF landed prices for comparable products. For
revenue projections., it is assumed that the ex-factory prices will remain at
1981 levels in real terms up to June 30, 1984, when the Government is expected
to revise its pricing policy following the proposed Fertilizer Marketing and
Pricing Study. For the period beyond June 30, 1984, the financial accounting
prices are assumed to be the same as the economic accounting prices used in
project analysis. Agreement has been reached with the Government under the
Phase I Project that prices for locally-produced fertilizers will at least be
at levels comparable to the CIF landed prices of similar imports as long as the
Government sets ex-factory prices for fertilizers. This agreement was recon-
firmed under the proposed Project. Prices of copper and sulfuric acid are not
controlled by the Government and, therefore, KBI has the flexibility to deter-
mine prices for those products based on market forces. Agreement has been
reached with the Government that it will continue to permit KBI the flexibility
to set prices for its products based upon production costs under conditions of
efficient operation, investment requirements and market conditions.

B.   Production and Production Costs
7.03      The capacity utilization of the plants included under the Project
was as follows in 1980: Iskenderun, 66%; lMersin, 44% for CAN and 12% for
DAP; Foca, 43%; and KBI-Samsun, 8% for suli-uric acid and 26% for copper
blister. The TSP plant in Iskenderun has a remaining economic life of about
seven years during which capacity utilization is expected to go down to 40%.
A new DAP unit (not included in the proposed Project) would be in operation by
1989 when the existing TSP plant is expected to cease operation.
7.04      In evaluating the impact of the Eroject on the increase in capacity
utilization, only the increase in production over and above what could be
achieved by ensuring adequate raw material supply to those plants are attri-
buted to the Project. On this basis, the increase in the rate of capacity
utilization resulting from the Project is as follows: Iskenderun from 40% to
60% for TSP; Mersin, from 45% to 85% for CAN, and from 75% to 90% for DAP;
Foca, from 60% to 90%; and KBI-Samsun, from 60% to 85% for blister copper and
from 35% to 85% for sulfuric acid.  Under the Project, a new AS unit in Mersin
will come on stream in 1985 and is assumed to achieve a capacity utilization
of 90% in 1987. With adequate provision for revamping, training and opera-
tional assistance, the attainment of the above capacity utilization levels is
considered realistic.
7.05      Almost all of the fertilizer plani:s under the Project are based
on imported raw materials, i.e., pyrites, rock phosphate, ammonia. Imported
raw materials for fertilizer production are valued at the CIF import price.
The cost of imported raw materials is expect:ed to increase during 1980-85 in
real terms and this is taken into account itt the projections. Prices of local
urea (bought by EGE from IGSAS for NP production) and fuel oil are close to
international levels. Labor costs are basecl on past payroll costs of the
respective Companies. Utility costs are based on prevailing unit rates in
Turkey. Maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of the equipment and civil
works for the first five years after debottlenecking/modifications, rising to
3.5% from 1991 and onwards as the project facilities get older. Depreciation
is calculated on a 'straight line basis on the assumed 12-year life after
rehabilitation.
C.   Financial Projections for the Project
7.06      In order to reflect a reasonably accurate picture of the Companies
financial obligations, cash generation and liquidity situation before and
after debottlenecking/modifications, the financial projections are made in
current US$ terms. Output prices as well as production costs in current
terms are projected to increase at an average annual rate of 7.8% in 1982,
8% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986 and onwards.

a/   The capacity utilization in the TSP plant would gradually decrease
because of the age of the plant. The decline would be, however, checked
to some extent during 1983-86 with the provision of spare parts under the
Project. The TSP plant would cease operation by the end of 1988 when the
new DAP plant is expected to be commissioned.

7.08      Total incremental sales from the Project are estimated at US$285.2
million in 1986, rising to US$327.4 million in 1988 when most of the plants
would have reached the optimum capacity level   The Project is expected to
generate a net profit of US$45.7 million in the first year after rehabilita-
tion/modifications in 1986; this profit is expected to reach US$51.6 million
by 1988 as production builds up and operating costs are reduced due to in-
creased operational efficiency and energy saving. The Project is expected to
generate from the first year of operations suificient cash to more than meet
its debt service requirements.
D. Financial Rate of Return
7.09      The cost and benefit streams for the incremental financial rate of
return are expressed in real 1981 terms as shown in Annex 7-6. The return
is satisfactory at about 61% before and 34% after taxes. Results of sensi-
tivity test are summarized below:

7.10      The above sensitivity tests indicate that even under adverse circum-
stances, the Project shows very satisfactory rates of return. The rate of
return is more sensitive to changes in sales revenue than in operating and
capital costs.  A one-year delay in project implementation, combined with a
10% capital cost increase and the attainment oF 10% less capacity utilization
than assumed would reduce the total Project return to 47%. However, the
likelihood of this happening is low, particularly because of the involve-
ment of experienced engineering firms and the ;?rovision for a comprehensive
training program.

7.12      The projections for the Companies show that during 1982-88, total
sales and net profit of AKGUBRE will increase by an average annual rate of 21%
and 53%, respectively; EGE by 18% and 29%, respectively; and KBI-Samsun by
11% and 14%, respectively. Net profits increase faster than sales for all
Companies because of the increase in the efficiency of operation and the
spreading of fixed costs over a higher volume of production. In the case of
AKGUBRE, net profit increases at a comparatively higher rate because of the
high margin earned from ammonium sulfate.



- 51 -
7.13      The projections also show that the cash generation for all the Com-
panies will be adequate to finance the local costs of the rehabilitation sub-
projects. In addition, debt service obligations of the Companies are expected
to be covered comfortably, and strong liquidity position is projected to be
maintained.
F. Financial Covenants
7.14      The current ratio for three out of four Companies is over 1.3:1 and
the debt/equity ratio is better than 60/40 for all of them. GUBRE, which is
likely to have a current ratio of about 1.1 during the period of implementation
of its Yarimca Rehabilitation Project (1981-86) financed under Loan 1985-TU,
the Company will maintain a current ratio of at least 1.1:1 until December 31,
1986 and thereafter maintain a current ratio of at least 1.3:1 at all times.
The other three companies will be required to maintain a current ratio of
1.3:1 at all times. GUBRE, which will be permitted to have a lower current
ratio until the end of 1986, will not, however, without the Bank consent,
declare dividends or make any other cash distribution if after such payments
the current ratio falls below 1.4:1. Further, the following financial
covenants will be applied to all Companies: (i) maintain a debt/equity ratio
of not less than 60/40; and (ii) not incur ac.ditional debt if, by so doing,
the projected debt service coverage will fall below 1.5 times. It was further
agreed that during Project implementation, AXGUBRE and EGE will not invest
more than US$5 million per year each on works other than included under the
Project without prior approval of the Bank. In the case of GUBRE and KBI,
they will not invest without prior Bank apprcval more than US$5 million per
year each over and above what is required for the investment on works included
under the Bank-financed Yarimca Fertilizer Rationalization Subproject of GUBRE
(under Loan No. 1985-TU) and the Murgul Copper Concentrate Rehabilitation
Sub-project of KBI (Loan No. 1998-TU). It was also agreed with the Companies
that they will periodically revalue their assets for memorandum account on the
basis of replacement cost and in accordance with sound accounting principles.
G. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.15      GUBRE, AKGUBRE, EGE AND KBI will be required to submit to the Bank
annual reports examined by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank within
four months of the end of the accounting year. The Companies will give prompt
attention to audit recommendations. In addition to the annual audit reports,
the Companies will submit quarterly financial statements within 45 days after
the end of each quarter and monthly project progress and procurement status
reports within three weeks of the end of each month. Finally, within six
months after the closing date for the Project, the Companies will prepare
and furnish to the Bank a completion report on the Project dealing with its
implementation, initial operation, and the costs and benefits derived and
expected to be derived therefrom.
H. Risks
7.16      Risks associated with project technology, start-up and operations
are moderate as the Project is based on commercially proven technology, and
adequate arrangements have been made under the Project for training personnel
for operation and maintenance. However, commissioning problems after reha-
bilitation and difficulties in attaining and maintaining a high operating



- 52 -
rate cannot be ruled out. Considering the involvement of experienced and
established engineering firms in the design, engineering and commissioning
of the Project, the risk of abnormal problems, shutdowns and low operating
rate is not, however, considered serious.
7.17      The main risk facing the Project is the possibility of delays in
implementation and inadequate cost controls due to management deficiency.
However, this risk will be reduced with the strengthening of the operational
staff and project teams of GUBRE, AKGUBRE, EGE and KBI, the involvement of the
engineering firms for project design and implementation, and the understanding
reached that qualification and experience of individuals appointed for key
management positions will be consistent with the job requirements. However,
the management aspect will require continuous monitoring by the Bank to help
avoid problems.
7.18      No market risk is foreseen.  Even on the basis of a conservative
market forecast, the country will continue to be deficit in fertilizer even
after the Project is completed. The financing plan assumes that approximately
US$2.1 million for the GUBRE subproject, US$27.9 million for the AKGUBRE sub-
project, US$3.2 million for the EGE subproject and US$7.2 million for the KBI
subproject will come from internally generated funds. This, of course,
depends on the Government allowing them adequate ex-factory prices. Measures
have already been taken by the Government in this direction and the assurances
being sought on the pricing policy further mitigates this risk. Should the
internally generated funds fall short of requirements, the Companies are
expected to borrow and/or increase their share capital within the stipulated
60/40 debt/equity ratio.
7.19      The operational foreign exchange requirements for the Project for
procuring raw and other materials will increase after rehabilitation. This
will be more than fully compensated by the foreign exchange saved by reducing
the finished fertilizer imports as a result of increased production from the
Project. The commitment by the Government to provide adequate foreign
exchange for raw and maintenance materials should give further assurance in
this respect (para 5.16).
VIII.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Economic Justification
8.01      Iskenderun, Foca and Mersin fertilizer plants account for approxi-
mately 20% of the total fertilizer nutrient capacity in Turkey. These plants
were operating at low capacity (35-65%) during 1978-80, due primarily to
technical and material supply problems. The proposed Project would increase
capacity utilization in the plants by 15-40% beyond the increases expected as
a result of more timely supply of raw material supplies and working capital
which have hindered production in the past. The proposed Project will help
maximize utilization of existing upstream units in Mersin   with the installa-
tion of a new ammonium sulfate unit. In the case of KBI - Samsun, the proposed
Project would eliminate the bottlenecks in the copper smelter plant and enable
it to increase production by 25% of capacity. The Project would also help



- 53 -
rehabilitate the sulfuric acid plant in Samsan and increase production by 50%
of capacity. The increased production of suLfuric acid, an intermediate
product for manufacturing phosphatic fertilizers, would allow Kbi to better
meet the demand for it particularly by the nearby fertilizer plant of AZOT.
B.   World Prices of Fertilizers and Inputs
8.02      Past experience shows that world fertilizer prices have strong
cyclical fluctuations. This is mainly because of overinvestment in fertilizer
production facilities when international prices are high and the postponement
and/or cancellation of investments when prices fall. Fertilizer prices peaked
in mid-1974 and prices remained high until m:id-1975. Subsequently, they
declined sharply during 1976/77 due to the reduced imports of fertilizer by
countries which had accumulated substantial stocks during the panic buying
of 1973-75 in anticipation of further price increases, and the substantial
investments stimulated by high prices in the early 1970s. From the low
levels of 1976/77, fertilizer prices have been rising but have not yet
reached the long-term equilibrium level. According to the projections made by
the Bank Commodities Division, fertilizer prices (FOB exporting countries)
are expected to reach the long-term equilibrium level by 1985--US$268/ton for
urea, 1/ US$227/ton for TSP and US$324/ton fcr DAP in 1980 terms. Beyond
1985, fertilizer prices are expected to increase in real terms as a result of
real increases in energy prices.
8.03      The output prices used in the econcmic analysis are based on the
above projected FOB price and include freight, insurance, and local port
handling charges of US$55/ton. This calculation assumes that Turkey would
import fertilizers mainly from Europe and the Middle East. Economic prices
for imported inputs are calculated on the sane basis. The locally supplied
input is valued at its FOB value if the input (e.g., fuel oil) is in surplus
with respect to the country-s needs; if the input is in short supply, it is
valued at the landed CIF price (e.g., rock phosphate). Non-tradeable items
are valued at their financial costs excluding taxes and duties and other
transfer payments.
C.   Economic Rate of Return
8.04      The assumptions used in the economic analysis are given in Annex
8-1. Investment, operating cost and revenue streams used in the base cost
economic rate of return calculations are given in Annex 8-2. The incremental
benefits from the Project come from: (i) the increase in production volume
(over and above what could be realized by making adequate foreign exchange
available for imported raw materials and spares); (ii) prolongation of the
economic life of the plants through necessary replacement investments; (iii)
addition of new fertilizer units to maximize utilization of existing upstream
facilities; and (iv) the decrease in the energy consumption and other operating
costs.
8.05      On the basis of input and output prLces calculated on the assump-
tions explained above, the sub-projects show economic rates of return ranging
from 66% for KBI-Samsun, 49% for Foca, 44% for Mersin and 20% for Iskenderun.
For the Project as a whole, the return is est:imated at 49%.

8.06      The following table shows the results of the sensititivity analysis
on the incremental economic rates of return:

As shown in the above table, the economic rate of return for the Project is
sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices, operating costs and delays in
construction. A 10% drop in revenue would reduce the return of the Project to
35% and a 10% increase in operating costs would reduce the return to 39%. A
one-year delay in implementation combined with a 10% capital cost increase and
the ultimate attainment of capacity utilization of 10% less than assumed would
reduce the returns to 38%. Even under conceivable adverse conditions, there-
fore, the Project yields satisfactory rates of return.
8.07      In considering the basic justification for rehabilitating the
existing facilities, it is important to consider, in addition to the incre-
menta:L returns, the economic viability of the facilities after the rehabilita-
tion. Therefore, the economic rates of return for the entire facilities at
the four locations have also been calculated before and after the proposed
Project treating the past investment on those plants as sunk costs but taking
their salvage values into account. Salvage values of the old plants at
Iskenderun, Mersin, Foca and Samsun are estimated at US$20 million, US$44
million, US$12 million and US$19 million, respectively, at 1980 prices.
The results of the economic analysis based on the above assumptions are
summarized below:
Economic Rate of Return for Entire Facilities (%)
Before Rehabilitation    After Rehabilitation
Iskenderun                    -8                          12
Mersin                        30                          42
Foca                          27                          36
Samsun                        37                          56
8.08      The above table shows that after rehabilitation, all the four
Complexes included under the Project will be economically more viable.



- 55 -
As a matter of fact, the economic return which would have been -8% without
provision of additional spare parts for the Iskenderun complex improves
substantially to 12% as capacity utilization of the TSP plant is increased to
60%.  In the case of Foca, the establishment of a new MAP unit provides the
flexibility to produce a product close to DX3 which is gaining in importance
while continuing to produce NP to meet the regional needs; and overall economic
rate of return for the Complex increases from about 27% to 36%. As for the KBI
Samsun Complex, the Project will help increase copper blister production while,
at the same time, increasing the supply of sulfur dioxide gases which would be
used by the KBI sulfuric acid plant to augment the acid production of the AZOT
plant nearby: and the overall economic rate of return for the KBI Complex
increases from 37% to 56% due to the Project. In the case of Mersin, analyses
have been made (Project File: B2) to find ou: the rates of return under the
following alternative configuration:  (i) continuing with the present product
mix; (ii) using part of the sulfuric acid from the existing sulfuric acid
plant and produce ammonium sulfate to meet the regional needs and use the rest
for producing phosphoric acid and meeting the shortfall in phosphoric acid
from imports for the DAP plant; (iii) product:ion of ammonium sulfate based on
imported sulfuric acid; and (iv) production of ammonium sulfate based on a
new sulfuric acid plant based on imported su:fur or pyrites. Among the above
alternatives, (iii) and (iv) were found uneconomic because of the sharp
fluctuations in the supply and price of sulfuric acid in the international
market in the case of alternative (iii) and because of the high investment
cost required in the case of alternative (iv). Among alternatives (i) and
(ii), the latter was found more economic as it shows an overall economic rate
of return of 42% for the Mersin Complex compared to 30% for alternative (i).
Production of AS in will not only help meet t:he regional needs for that
product but also give AKGUBRE the flexibility in its product mix to meet the
seasonal and regional variation in the demand for individual fertilizers for
specific crops. AKGUBRE could also use part of AS to produce NP should the
regional needs for it increase.
D.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.09      In 1989, when the Project reaches the forecast production levels,
the domestic production of fertilizers, blister copper, sulfuric acid,
nitric acid and phosphoric acid would increase by about 630,000 tons, 10,000
tons, 240,000 tons, 180,000 tons and 25,000 tons, respectively, and would save
an estimated gross import cost (CIF Turkish lorts) of US$208 million in 1980
prices (Annex 8-3). Net of foreign debt service and direct material imports,
the Project would still generate foreign exchange savings of US$80 million in
1989 at 1980 prices. The foreign exchange ccst of the Project would be more
than covered with the net foreign exchange savings of one year after Project
completion in 1986.
E.   Other Economic Benefits
8.10      Through the Project, the Bank will be working closely with the State
Planning Organization to help increase the capacity utilization in the
fertilizer sector as a whole. Further, as a part of the institution-building
effort, training programs will be instituted for the four Companies. The
unquantifiable economic benefits of training as well as technical assistance,
and assured supplies of fertilizer add to the attractiveness of the Project.
Further, the Fertilizer Raw Material Resource Study will help prepare a
master plan for the development of the fertilizer industry, while the Refinery
Sector Study will help prepare a sound investment program for the oil refining
industry in Turkey.

to an agreed schedule (para 5.18);
(v) in case of default by a beneficiary company, if
one or more of the commercial banks should fail to
honor their guarantee, the Government will not have
recourse to TSKB for the amount due from the
commercial banks (para 6.10);
(vi) ensure that prices for locally-produced fertilizers
will at least be comparable to the CIF landed prices
of similar imports as long as the Government sets
ex-factory fertilizer prices (paras 6.11 and 7.02); and
(vii) continue to allow KBI to determine prices for
its products (para 7.02).
B.   With the Companies that they will:
(i) develop and implement the training program after
approval by the Bank (para 5.08);
(ii) maintain adequately staffed full-time Project teams
to manage the Project during its implementation
(para 5.10);
(iii) ensure that the Project facilities will meet satisfac-
tory environmental standards (para 5.14);
(iv) award contracts for civil works and erection services
under procedures acceptable to the Bank including
prequalification (para 6.13);

ANNEX 2-2
TURKEY - SECOND FERTILIZER INDUSTRY RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
FERTILIZER RAW MATERIAL RESOURCE STUDY
TERMS OF REFERENCE
A. Background
1.        Turkey's fertilizer production started in 1939 on a small scale
at Karabuk Iron and Steel Works, with the :roduction of ammonium sulfate
as a by-product based on coke even gas.  Production facilities have
grown over time and today the fertilizer Industry in Turkey is undergoing
a period of growth and development. There are eight companies producing
exclusively fertilizers. Of these, two (AZOT and IGSAS) are in public
sector and operate four plants; and four (BAGFAS, ISKUR, EGE and TOROS)
are in the private sector and operate four plants. In addition, three
public sector companies--a petrochemcial company (PETKIM) and two steel
companies (KARABUK and ISDEMIR)--are producing ammonium sulfate fertilizer
as a by-product in three plants. The total annual capacity of the plants
is about five million product tons equivalent to 928,300 tons of nitrogen
(N) and 850,000 tons of phosphorus (P) nutrients. The capacity
utilization was generally low in the past butis showing a rising trend
since 1980. It is estimated that the prodttction of N and P will increase
from 459,500 tons and 352,200 tons, respectively, in 1980 to 809,000 tons
and 720,000 tons, respectively, by 1987.
2.        Turkey depends heavily on imported raw materials, including
hydrocarbon products, rock phosphate and sulfur, for its fertilizer
production as the local resources are not fully explored and exploited.
As a result, during 1979 and 1980, the country imported US$236 million
worth of materials for fertilizer production.
3.        Turkey's domestic crude oil production hardly meets one-fifth
of its annual consumption. This results in direct and indirect imports
of the main inputs for N fertilizer production. Reserves of natural gas,
the most efficient feedstock for N production, have been found at Thrace in
the northwest. However, reliable estimates of proven gas reserves and their
composition are not available at present and it may require additional drilling
of holes to obtain such data. 1/ Currently, the country relies mostly on
oil-based hydrocarbon inputs (naphtha and Euel oil from the refining
of imported crude oil) and on imported ammonia for the production
1/ In this context, the consultants appoint:ed for the Fertilizer Raw
Material Resource Study will follow-up on the results of a Bank-
financed study, now underway, to help establish the priority for
the use of gas at Thrace.

of N fertilizers. To compensate to some extent its lack of oil-based
hydrocarbons, Turkey is also seeking to base part of the ammonia
production on the extensive local lignite deposits. However, the potential
lignite reserves need a critical examination with respect to their quality
for ammonia production.
4.        Turkey has phosphate rock deposits in Mazidagi, Aydin-Mugla,
and some other regions; but so far only limited geological prospection,
mining and beneficiation tests have been conducted. Known phosphate deposits
are low in phosphorus (P) content, contain carbonates and are generally mixed
with flintstones. Further, most of the deposits are located in remote regions
wit!h limited transportation infrastructure. As a result, about 80% of
total fertilizer production is currently based on imported phosphate
rock.
5.        Due to the relative small local deposits and limited production
of sulfur as a by-product at the oil refineries, Turkey can meet only a
minor portion of its sulfur requirements for fertilizer production.
However, Turkey has large deposits of pyrites, often along with copper
pyrites, which can be used as raw material in the fertilizer industry.
Actually, most of the existing sulfuric acid plants are based on local
pyrites.
6.        The country's mineral wealth affords good possibilities for
self-sufficiency in some minerals. Turkey is endowed with fertilizer raw
material resources which could be exploited to increase their use in
local fertilizer production. The resources have been explored since the
1930s by the Mining Research and Development Institute (MTA). Other
public enterprises such as Turkiye Petrolleri A.O. (TPAO), Turkiye
Kmuir Isletmeleri (TKI) and ETIBANK are continuing exploration and
exploitation activities in specific areas, e.g., TPAO for oil and gas,
TKI for coal and lignite, and ETIBANK, among other things, for phosphate,
sulfur and pyrites.
B. Objectives
7.        The main objectives of the Fertilizer Raw Material Resource
Study will be to:
(a) Establish the existing and projected demand for fertilizer
raw, materials;
(b) Establish and assess the availability of suitable raw materials
which can be exploited economically to meet the requirements of existing
and planned plants;
(c) Review the need and availability of infrastructure (power,
water, roads, amenities, etc.) facilities for exploitation
of raw material resources;



- 61 -
ANNEX 2-2
Page 3
(d) Devise a transportation and distribution pattern considering
the relationships to and respective transportation needs for raw materials
of the plant sites together with the transportation requirements for finished
products from plant site to the consuming centers;
(e) Make a location study for future fertilizer plants and
recommend optimal locations, capacities and product mix on the basis
of (b) and (d);
(f) Devise a long-term plan for the development of the fertilizer
sector based on local resources;
(g) Determine any institutional, organizational, operational
or regulatory changes which may be necessary to ensure that the long-term
plan can be implemented efficiently and effasctively; and
(h) Review and recommend effective and economic measures for
the disposal of cinders, resulting from the use of pyrites for sulfuric
acid production.
C. Specific Tasks
8.        Specific tasks are explained below:
(i)  Demand for Fertilizer Raw Materials
(a) Review the processes used by each plant and establish
the specifications and quantity of raw materials and intermediate products
required by each plant at design capacity;
(b) Examine the country's future programs for expansion of
fertilizer production and establish the specifications and quantities
of additional raw material and intermediate product requirements by new
plants at design capacity;
(c) In cooperation with the State Planning Organization (SPO)
and the Ministry of Agriculture, review the demand projections for
fertilizer raw materials and intermediate products, prepare revised
forecasts up to 1990, and relate them to available and planned production
capacities to produce such materials.
(ii) Available Raw Materials
(a) Review the data available at MTA, TPAO, TKI and ETIBANK
related to fertilizer raw materials and evalaate the quality of those
materials with respect to their impurities a-id chemical characteristics;
(b) Estimate from the available data from different sources the
reserves divided into proven, probable and possible categories, and
indicate appropriate approaches (e.g., select:ive mining, washing,



ANNEX 2-2
Page 4
concentrating, etc.) and operating practices necessary to economically mine
those deposits and get the desired quality ore.  If the existing data
base is not sufficient to do this, develop a program for gathering
additional data;
(c) If the run-off mine ore is not directly usable as raw
material, evaluate alternative methods (e.g., washing, concentrating,
calcining, etc.) for beneficiating it, prepare terms of reference for
laboratory and pilot-tests, and estimate the costs for such tests;
(d) Prepare mining plans for each of the economically attractive
deposits and estimate the costs of exploiting them along with costs of
necessary infrastructure, giving the local and foreign exchange costs
separately. The mining plans should include organizational arrangements and
manpower requirements; and
(e) Review the operation and practices at the existing mines for
upgrading the quality of the ore and recommend measures to improve those
practices including better maintenance.
(iii) Infrastructure Facilities and Location
(a) Review the adequacy of infrastructure facilities (e.g., power,
water, roads, housing, communications) in the existing mines producing
fertilizer raw materials, and recommend what additional facilities are required
in different locations along with cost estimates;
(b) Examine the infrastructure requirements for developing
economically attractive deposits in new locations and estimate the investment
costs showing local and foreign exchange costs separately;
(c) Study the most cost-effective multi-mode transportation network
for transporting the raw materials from the mines to the fertilizer plants,
taking into account the available locomotives, rail wagons, trucks, loading/
discharging facilities at mines and ports, coastal ships and barges, etc.
and the expansion necessary for such facilities to cope with increased volume
of raw materials to be transported;
(d) Examine selected locations for new fertilizer plants and
establish priorities among those locations with respect to raw material
availability and quality, existing infrastructure facilities, nearness to
miarket and raw material deposit.
(iv) Institutional
(a) Review the existing institutions involved with the develop-
ment of the fertilizer and related industries, evaluate their policies as
well as legal and regulatory functions affecting the development of those



- 63 -
ANNEX 2-2
Page 5
industries, and recommend measures to improve their practices.
(v) Long-Term Plan
(a) Prepare a master plan for the development of the
fertilizer industry for 1981-90 based upon the review of the raw material
base and the country's need for fertilizers,.
(vi) Other
(a) Estimate the availability cf pyrite cinders at design capacity
from the existing and planned pyrite-based sulfuric acid plant;
(b) Identify possible industries that could use cinders without
or after processing in Turkey as well as abroad and estimate the demand
potential of those users;
(c) Analyze the characteristics of the cinders available
in Turkey and verify from laboratory tests their suitability for
use in industries;
(d) Examine the transportation facilities available and the
transportation cost involved for distributing cinders locally and abroad; and
(e) Recommend the least cost approach for the disposal of
pyrite cinders.

ANNEX 7-1
TTTUE.y- .'Fnln FgRTTTzTRR TNnUSTRY RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  Basis for Projections
The financial rates of return for the Project are calculated in
real :L981 terms, but the cash flow projections are done in current US$ to
reflect the actual financial position of the companies using projected
international inflation rates of 7.8% in 1982, 8.0% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984,
7.0% in 1985 and 6.0% in 1986 and onwards.
The assumptions used for capacity utilization before and after
the Project and the incremental production due to the Project are detailed
in Annex 7-2.
B. Production Build-up
The rehabilitation/modification of Iskenderun is expected to be
completed by December 1983, Foca by December 1984, Mersin by July 1985 and
Samsun by June 1985. The average capacity utilization in those plants is
expected to increase as follows:
Percentage (%)
1985     1986     1987      1988
1.  Foca                      85        90       90        90
2.  Iskenderun                60        50       40        40
3.  Mersin a/                 90        90       90        90
4. KBI-Samsun                 80        85       85        85
a/ For DAP.
C. V'ariable Production Costs
Prices of imported raw materials are adjusted for expected real
increases up to 1985, when their prices are assumed to reach the long-term
equilibrium level. The projected annual real increases for main imported
materials are given below:
1982     1983     1984      1985
Rock Phosphate      6.0      5.5       5.0      4.0
Sulfuric Acid       4.0      4.7       4.5      4.3
Phosphoric Acid    3.6       3.5       3.7      3.6



- 81 -
ANNEX 7-1
Page 2
For local materials, prices are expected to increase by 2% a year in real
terms up to 1985 and beyond that period it is assumed that there would be
no real increase.
D. Fixed Cost
Maintenance costs are estimated at 2.5% of new investment on plant
equipment and civil works during 1986-90, rising to 3.5% subsequently. On
the existing facilities, the current maintenance costs are assumed to continue
at the present level in 1981 prices.
Depreciation. The Project life is assumed to be 10 years after
rehabilitation. Straight line depreciation has been used over that period.
Interest on Long-term Debt. It is assumed that the Bank loan will
be onlent to KBI at 15.1%, and to GUBRE, IXGUBRE and EGE at 14.5% (net of
rebate).
Payroll (including fringe benefLts). No real increases in wages
and salaries are expected.
Other Costs. Assumed to be 0.5,' of the Project installed cost.
E. Legal Reserves
According to Turkish law, legal reserves are calculated at 5% of
net profit, until these reserves reach 50'% of the paid-up share capital.
F. Taxes
The financial projections take into account the existing corporate
tax rate of 50% on profits.

ANNEX 8-1
TURKEY - SECOND FERTILIZER INDUSTRY RATIONALIZATION AND ENERGY SAVING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. General
The economic rates of return for the Project are calculated in
real 1981 dollar terms. Project life is assumed at 10 years with no
terminal value credited to the Project except that for working capital
recovery. Duties and taxes are excluded from all cost and benefit
streams. The assumptions for increase in capacity utilization and incre-
mental production due to the Project are explained in Annex 7-2.
B. Benefits
Product prices used in the economic analysis are based on the
recent Bank projections 1/. Currently, the international fertilizer
prices are depressed and they are projected to reach the long-term
equilibrium level in 1985. These long-term equilibrium prices are expressed
in 1980 terms are used to calculate Project revenues. The following table
shows the economic accounting prices used for fertilizer products:
