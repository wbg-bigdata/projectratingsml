PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report of the Montenegro
Earthquake Rehabilitation Project - Highways in Yugoslavia. The project
focussed entirely on restoring earthquake damaged highway facilities and
structures to a level suitable for the safe and expedient operation of
traffic on the basic road network in Montenegro. A loan (Loan 1759-YU)
of Us$21 million was made for the project on September 18, 1979.
The attached Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by
the EHENA Transportation Division I with the assistance of the Borrower.
It reviews the extent of the project in a comprehensive manner.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project
performance audit reporting, this Completion Report was read by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) but the project was not audited
by OED staff. The draft Completion Report was sent to the Borrower and
its agencies. Their comments have been reproduced as an annex.

MONTENEGRO EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION - HIGHWAYS
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was the result of a devastating series of earthquakes
occurring during April and May 1979 along the Adriatic coastline of the
Republic of Montenegro in Yugoslavia. During this period earth tremors of
strong intensity were felt in most of the area of Hontenegro, the
southeastern  parts  of  the  Republic   of  Croatia,   the  Republic  of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the northern part of Albania.
The physical consequences of the earthquake were most evident along
the total length of the Montenegrin coastline in a belt 10 to 12 Km wide.
In this area over 100 people were killed and about 500 injured.  deavy
damage was sustained by the Titograd-Bar railroad, the Port of Bar and about
560 km of the Montenegro highway network.
The  Bank  loan  of   $21 million,   which  helped   finance   the
rehabilitation of the damaged roads, provided some retroactive financing of
the most urgent rehabilitation efforts necessary to restore traffic service
to the network and to provide emergency works necessary to protect the
existing facilities from further damage.
A federal law providing local funds by contributions from the other
republics/provinces   was  enacted   (SFRY  Official   Gazette   No. 36  of
July 27, 1979). Even so, there was a nine-month slowdown (August 1981 to
;=ay 1982) due to a shortage of local funds.
The project required a relatively low supervision effort in the
field (12.4 manweeks) as the project was problem-free and supervision was
always undertaken concommitantly with other on-aing projects.
The Bank's flexible approach in agreeing to emergency repair or
rehabilitation works being carried out on the basis of contracts with unit
*          rates agreed in advance by all contractors proved to be very expedient.

MONTENEGRO EARTHQUAKE REHABILITATION - HIGHWAYS
I. Introduction
1.01     On  April 15,  1979,  at  7.19  a.m.  local  time,  a  devastating
earthquake measuring IX on the modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MCS) with
an epicenter near Kotor, hit the Adriatic coastline of Montenegro,
Yugoslavia. Five more earthquakes of over VII MCS, as well as hundreds of
lesser aftershocks, struck the same area thereafter, with the last quake of
VIII MCS occurring on May 24, 1979. Earth tremors of strong intensity were
felt in most of Montenegro, the southeastern parts of S.R. Croatia, the
S.R. Bosnia-Herzegovina, and northern Albania during this period.
1.02     The physical consequences of the earthquake were most evident along
the total length of the Montenegrin coastline in a belt 10 to 12 km wide.
In this area over five hundred people were injured and one hundred killed as
a result of the quakes. The casualties could well have been much higher
except for the fact that the major shock was preceded by one of lesser
intensity which served as a warning, that April 15 was not a business day
(it was a Sunday) and that the major tourist season was not yet underway.
1.03     The earthquake seriously damaged the basic infrastructure of the
area.   The basic  transport  system,  schools,  hospitals,  houses,  hotels,
industrial plants, apartment buildings, cultural-historical monuments, the
water supply system, and the electric and telegraph-telephone grid were all
extensively and heavily damaged. Over 12,500 of the approximately 60,000
housing units in the area were destroyed and a further 12,000 heavily
damaged. Over 4,000 industrial buildings, schools, hospitals, hotels, etc.,
were completely destroyed and about 3,000 more severely damaged. The total
area of these 7,000 structures amounts to about 1.25 million square meters.
About one fourth of Montenegro's classified road network system, which
totals some 3,000 km of roads, was heavily damaged, including almost the
entire length of the Adriatic highway situated in Montenegro and almost all
the other main  roads  (approximately  600  km  total)  in  the  area.   The
Republic's main rail line, its main port and the area's airport were also
heavily damaged. The ancient cities of Kotor, Budva and Herceg-Novi, which
are important cultural and tourist attractions, were all heavily damaged.
1.04     The earthquake dealt a devastating blow to the tourist industry,
coming just before the season was to start in an area which contained more
than 90 percent of the Republic's 125,000 tourist beds. The damage to the
roadway network and the railway from Titograd to Bar as well as to the
airport at Tivat resulted in a situation immediately after April 15, 1979 in
which the only possible communication between the Montenegrin coast and the
rest  of  the  country  was  by  radio  and  helicopters.   Although  land
communication was partially restored within a few days, and largely



maintained even after subsequent earthquakes, economic activity was severely
curtailed. More than 5,000 people who would ordinarily be employed in the
tourist industry were without work.
1.05     Overall the economic consequences of the earthquakes were critical
to Montenegro which is one of the least developed regions in Yugoslavia.
This lag in development' has been due in large measure to the topography
which not only makes communication to and within the region difficult and
costly to build and maintain but which also dictated the historical
development of the main terrestrial transport links to the north and east
of the region. However, during the last two decades the Government has made
major efforts to improve transportation facilities with particular emphasis
on the Adriatic Highway along the coast, a major highway linking the
Adriatic Coast and the Port of Bar with Titograd, the Capital of
S.R. Montenegro, as well as with eastern Yugoslavia, the Belgrade-Bar
railway and a modern port at Bar. Except for the highway link from Titograd
to the coast, which was built with the financial assistance of USAID, these
transportation facilities were components of Bank financed projects.  All
were heavily damaged in the earth quakes.
1.06     The  Government  of  Yugoslavia  requested  the  Bank  to  provide
financial assistance for the rehabilitation of the earthquake damage in
S.R. Montenegro. The Government's request emphasized the extremely high
cost of restoring the physical damage as well as the losses to the economy
of the Republic as a result of the damage to the tourist facilities and the
industries in the region of Bar.  A federal law was enacted for providing
funds for reconstruction  (published  in the Official Gazette of SFRY on
July 27, 1979).   This  legislation  specifies  interim  contributions  to be
deposited  by  each  of  the  Republics  and  Autonomous  Provinces  into  a
Reconstruction Fund (Fund) established by S.R. Montenegro.  These interim
contributions amounting to Din 5 billion (US$267.4 million) were paid into
the Fund in equal installments at the end of August, October and
December 1979.  The law also provided that the total contributions to the
Fund would be determined, on the basis of the final damage estimates.
Provision was also made for equal contributions to be provided monthly in
1980, and that these, and any further contributions which may subsequently
be provided, would be increased by an amount equal to the increase in the
Consumer Price Index for the preceding year.   In addition to its direct
financial contribution, SFRY undertook to service the domestic and foreign
debt of enterprises struck by the earthquakes and provide supplementary
financing for social services.
II. Project Preparation, Objectives and Content
2.01     An  immediate  action  program  was  put  into  operation  by  the
Republic's maintenance Enterprise, Crnagoraput, to open damaged sections to
restricted  flows  of  traffic.   This  operation  was  too  large  for  one
enterprise to handle and arrangements were made to employ additional
maintenance enterprises from other republics. Several highway contractors
working in Montenegro were also mobilized to assist in restoring traffic
services disrupted by the April 15 and May 24 earthquakes.



-3-
2.02     The Roads Organization of Montenegro provided overall planning and
coordination of the rehabilitation effort, with considerable assistance from
the Design Institutes of Belgrade and Zagreb.
2.03     The  proposed  project  was  appraised  by  missions  which  visited
Yugoslavia in May/June and July 1979. The primary objective of the project
consisted entirely of remedial works necessary to preserve or restore the
damaged  road  facilities,  with  the  exception  of  realignments  where
restoration was not physically feasible or economically the least cost
solution, and for the replacement of structures which had been damaged
beyond repair.  The objective was to limit further economic  loss to the
existing road netwerk by preventing further physical deterioration and to
help restore normal economic activity in the region. The roads included for
works under the project have a total length of about 560 km, of which 360 km
are primary roads and 200 km are secondary (regional) roads.
2.04     The  estimated  cost  of  rehabilitation  was  1,190 million  dinars
(US$63.6 million), including duties and taxes which amount to about 12Z of
the  total.   The  foreign  cost  component  was  estimated  to  be  33X
(US$21 million) of total cost.  The cost estimates included a provision for
price escalation based on an annual escalation rate over a three year period
of 12X for local costs and 7% for foreign costs.  Although rehabilitation
works had been identified for the cost estimates, the scope of the civil
works could not be precisely quantified due to the widespread nacure of the
works as well as the additional damage caused by recurring quakes, rock and
earth slides, altered drainage courses and the onset of the rainy season.
For these reasons it was deemed prudent to include a physical contingency of
20%.
III. Project Implementation and Cost
3.01     The  loan  was  approved  by  the  Bank  Board  of  Directors  on
September 18,  1979.   It  was  signed  on  September 21, 1979  and  became
effective on December 19, 1979.  The  loan was made to the Self-Managing
Republic Community of Interest for Roads of the Socialist Republic of
Montenegro, Titograd, in the amount of US$21 million and guaranteed by the
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Supervision of the reconstruction
works was carried out by the Borrower and the Investment Bank of Titograd
was the fiscal agent for the project and the liaison agent between the
Borrower and the Bank. Retroactive financing, not to exceed US$5 million,
was used to finance the emergency works described in para 2.01.
3.02     The emergency works were costed on the basis of unit rates agreed
between the Borrower and its Maintenance Enterprise, "Crnagoraput", prior to
the commencement of the fiscal year. These rates are negotiated annually by
the  highway  administration  which  follows  costs  and  market  prices
systematically to ensure that the negotiated prices are reasonable.
Maintenance Enterprises from other Republics agreed to work for the same
unit prices.  The emergency works were diverse and limited in scope and
their locations so scattered that aggregation into packages of sizes
suitable for conventional contract bidding and award was not practical and
would have imposed unacceptable delays on the rehabilitation progran.



-4-
The Maintenance Enterprises concerned in the emergency work program were all
competent contractors and had all been prequalified for participation in the
Tenth Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU).  Standard civil works contracts were
executed and the Bank's disbursements were made against contractor invoices
submitted by the Borrower supplemented by proper documentation.
3.03     Rehabilitation works of a less urgent nature which required more
detailed design and were not subject to additional damage due to rainfall or
run-off, were contracted on the basis of international competitive bidding
procedures.   The thrust of the project was  solely directed toward road
rehabilitation and did not include provisions for maintenance, equipment, or
training. The works performed on this loan did not overlap or conflict with
civil works financed under the Tenth Highway Project.
3.04     The  total  cost  of  the  project  involving  Bank  financing  is
USt63.6 million, which corresponds to the appraisal estimates, some works
currently being completed entirely with local funds.  However, there are
major variations from link to link between actual costs and appraisal
estimates. Table 1 shows the actual amounts paid on the large number of
individual contracts which covered a wide range of rehabilitation and repair
works under the project. Table 2, which presents a link-by-link summary of
the appraisal cost estimates compared to the actual final costs indicates
that there are cost overruns or underruns greater than lOX on eleven of the
fifteen links and greater than 30Z in about half the cases.   The major
reasons for these discrepancies is the difficulty in making detailed cost
estimates for a wide variety of construction activities scattered over a
large area.  In addition, the quakes caused changes in water courses and
substrata bearing services were altered.   Cracks  in pavement,  retaining
walls and cut and fill slopes were subjected to erosive effects by the
elements which added to the rehabilitation costs.  Surface and sub-surface
changes were not easily evaluated and this contributed to the problem of
estimating the costs with any degree of accuracy. In spite of this problem,
sufficient funds were available to complete the rehabilitation of the
damaged links and put them back in operation in the system.
3.05     The  loan was  disbursed  on  the  basis  of 33  percent  of  total
expenditures, the percentage representing the estimated foreign exchange
component of the civil works. Disbursements on this project were slow for a
nine month period from August 1981 to May 1982 due to a shortage of local
funds, but then picked up throughout the remainder of 1982 and the project
was completely disbursed on schedule by December 1982 (Table 3). During the
period of the loan, the dinar exchange rate depreciated from 21 dinars per
UStl.O0 to 67 dinars per US$1.00.
IV. Institutional and Operational Development
4.01     The overall objective of the project, which was to restore traffic
service to the basic road network, protect the existing facilities from
further damage and rehabilitate the damaged areas, has been achieved. The
development of the basic road network in recent years has been a major
factor in opening up this less developed region and integrating it more



-5-
closely with major Yugoslav and international market centers, thus
stimulating national and international trade and enhancing employment and
economic development. The improved road network was a major component of
the infrastructure serving the important and growing international tourist
trade which has developed along the Adriatic coast of Montenegro in recent
years. The road network in the Titograd-Bar corridor also serves a large
industrial and mining complex, which is a key sector of the economy.
Because of the special nature of the loan, there were no provisions for
institutional development included in this project. However, one result of
the earthquake was a review by the Montenegrin authorities of the structural
design code to take account of higher seismic load factors.
V. Economic Justification
5.01     Because of the nature of the project, individual economic rates of
return (ERs) for each subproject were not developed since the rehabilitation
works in several sectors are critically interdependent for the restoration
of vital  components  of  the  economy  as  a  whole.   Consequently,  these
investments must be treated as an integrated investment package, the
benefits accruing from them being the resultant increase in production and
income in the various economic sectors from their depressed levels following
the earthquake.  This quantification cannot be carried out.  However, most
of the roads in the rehabilitation program have heavy traffic flows in
excess of 1,000 vehicles/day and without the restoration of the basic
roadway network the economy of S.R. Montenegro would not only stagnate but,
in fact, would retrogress. The rehabilitation program repaired the existing
network which could not function as a result of earthquake damage.   In
particular, the rehabilitation of the road network was necessary to provide
the traffic service to carry goods and services needed for the restoration
of other sectors of the economy.  Several of the damaged roads had been
built with Bank assistance (Loans 334-YU and 678-YU).  All of the roads
included in the rehabilitation program are critical elements of the basic
road network described in the Montenegro Highway N4aster Plan (1979 to 1985)
prepared for the Tenth Highway Project (Loan 1678-YU) and are therefore
considered, prima facie, economically justified.
VI. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
6.01     The ability of the highway authorities to react so rapidly and
efficiently to this natural disaster is indicative of their institutional
capabilities. The land connections to neighboring Republics were restored
within two or three days on a make shift basis and rehabilitation was
immediately  started  throughout  the  Republic.   It  was  apparent  that
considerable  teamwork  between  Republics,  contractors  and  Maintenance
Enterprises was being exercised at all levels and that administrative
procedures were reduced to a minimum.



-6-
6.02     Most emergency works were too widely scattered and too limited in
scope to be aggregated into sizes suitable for conventional contract
bidding. The Bank's flexible approach (para. 3.02) in agreeing to emergency
repair and rehabilitation works being carried out on the basis of contracts
with unit rates, established in advance and agreed by all contractors,
proved to be very expedient.
6.03     Normally   the   Council   of   Republican   and   Provincial   Road
Organizations (CRO) acted as a fiscal agent in multi-republic highway
loans. At the request of the Borrower, the Bank agreed, as an exception for
this single Republic loan, to the appointment of the Investment Bank of
Titograd as fiscal agent (para. 3.01) in lieu of CRO.  In retrospect, this
arrangement proved satisfactory, and expedited transmission of documents for
quicker loan disbursements.
