A.  IN i-RODUCTION
The Government of India (Gol), acting through the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a part
of the Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST) is improving the Sikandra to Dhanbad portion of the NH-2
as, part of the World Bank assisted Third National Highway Project. To facilitate implementation of the
project, the project corridor has been divided into five packages, referred to as packages I to V.
In'ternational consultants' have been appointed for the planning and design of each of these five
packages. Based on the findings of the various project reports prepared by the consultants, the
following contract packages have been selected as candidates for the appraisal by the World Bank in
February 2000. Of these, the packages to be implemented in the first phase would be selected during
the Appraisal Mission.

.  To keep land acquisition and building demolition at a minimum
. To provide maximum safety to the highway users and roadside communities as well as
segregation of local and slow moving traffic in the congested areas
ï  To develop a design that incorporates environmental safeguards and
*  To provide mitigation measures to all expected environmental degradabon
C.2.2  Construction Stage
* To prevent and reduce the negative environmental impacts of the project by implementable
mitigation measures, to be carried out by the Contractor.
.  To ensure that the provisions of the EMP are strictly followed and implemented by
strengthening implementation arrangements.
C.2.3  Operation Stage
* To prevent deterioration of natural environment components of air, water, soil, noise etc.
*  To improve the safety of the highway users and road-side communities

environment at critical locations have been suggested as Performance -Indicators (Pis), and are listed
below.
*  Air quality w.r.t SPM, RSPM and CO
&  Water quality w.r.t DO,BOD and Coliform count.
- Noise levels around sensitive locations.
* Replantation success I survival rate
e Erosion indices
i Restoration of borrow pits
* Sedimentation rate in the downstream wherebridges, culverts, etc are built
*  Vital statistic Qn health
* Accident frequency
F.2   SELECTION OF INDICATORS FOR MONITORING
Listed below are the environmental parameters that may be qualitatively and quantitatively measured
and compared over a period of time. These have been selected as Performance Indicators (Pls) due to
their importance and the availability of standardised procedures and expertise.
* Air Quality
*  Noise levels
* Water Quality
. Flora
Following sub-sections describe each of these Pis in detail.
F.2.1 Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) Monitoring
Ambient air quality parameters recommended for monitoring road transportation developments are
Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Carbon Monoxide (CO),
Oxides of Nitrogen (NO,x) and Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) These are to be monitored at designated
locations starting from the commencement of construction activity. Data should be generated over three
days at all identified locations in accordance to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards formulated
by MoEF in 1981.(Table 4) The location, duration and the pollution parameters to be monitored and the
responsible institutional arrangements are detailed out in the Environmental Monitoring Plan (Table 7)

F.2.3 Noise level Monitoring
The measurements for monitoring noise levels would be canied out at all designated locations along all
contract packages in accordance to the Ambient Noise Standards, given in Table 6, formulated by
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in 1989. Sound pressure levels would be monitored on twenty-
four hour basis. Noise should be recorded at a 'A" weighted frequency using a ' slow time response
mode' of the measuring instrument. The location, duration and the noise pollution parameters to be
monitored and the responsible institutional arrangements are detailed out in the Environmental
Monitoring Plan (Table: 7)

F.2.4 Success of Revegetation
To ensure the proper maintenance and monitoring of the compensatory afforestation being carried out,
a regular maintenance and monitoring of the survival rate of the planted trees is being proposed upto a
period of 3 years from the operationalisation of the project. (Table 7).
F.2.5 Soil Contamination
Contamination of the soil, especially due to increased levels of Pb, Cd and Cr are likely due to the
increased traffic movement on the project conidor. The comparison of the concentrations of these
parameters before and after the project coming up would aid in arriving at the increase in
concentrations of these heavy metals, if any.
F.3   MONITORING PLAN
The monitoring plan for the various perfomnance indicators of the project in the construction and
operation stages is summarised in Table 7 below.
