This report details the  Environmental Management Plan  for Package III-C, from  Paharpur village
(km.245.000) -Raja Talab (km.317.000) of the Third National Highway Project. The EMP is based on
the EIA/EMP reports carried out along Package III of the project.
B.  SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
The high volume carrying stretch of the NH-2, between Sikandra to Dhanbad is to be widened to four
lane, within the existing RoW, avoiding land acquisition as far as possible, except for locations where it
is absolutely essential from traffic engineering, environmental and social aspects where a diversion
from the existing alignment is necessitated.
Following is the scope of work as stated in the ToR for feasibility studies and detailed engineering
consultancy services,
T..The scope will consist mainly widening of the existing two lane to four lane within the RoW, inter alia
including fixation of alignment, alignments of the proposed widening work, improvements, if any. Required
to the existing alignment, identification and fixation of alignments of short bypasses, identification of
locations of servlce roads, identification, location and design of toll plazas etc necessary arboniculture along
the hiqghway and plantation on the median stnps compatible with the surrounding landscape shall be suitably
suggested.

C.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
C.1   INTRODUCTION
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) consists of the set of mitigation, monitoring and
institutional measures to be taken up during the design, construction and operation stages of the
project to eliminate adverse environmental impacts, to offset them, or to reduce them to acceptable
levels. The plan also includes the actions needed for the implementation of these measures.
The major components of the Environmental Management Plan are-
* Mitigation of potentially adverse impacts
* Monitoring during project implementation and operation
Institutional Capacity Building and Training
* Implementation Schedule and Environmental Cost Estimates
* Integration of EMP with Project planning, design, construction and operation.
C-2   OBJECTIVES OF THE EMP
The main aim of the Environmental Management Plan is to ensure that the various adverse impacts are
mitigated and the positive impacts are enhanced. The objectives of the EMP at various stages of the
project planning and implementation are as follows:
C.2.1  Design Stage
*  To have minimum impact on road side trees, forestation and ground cover
*  To keep land acquisition and building demolition at a minimum
*  To provide maximum safety to the highway users and road side communities as well as
segregation of local and slow moving traffic in the congested areas
-  To develop a design that incorporates environmental safeguards and
-  To provide mitigation measures to all expected environmental degradation
C.2.2  Construction Stage
*  To prevent and reduce the negative environmental impacts of the project by implementable
mitigation measures, to be carried out by the Contractor.
.  To ensure that the provisions of the EMP are strictly followed and implemented by
strengthening implementation arrangements.
C.2.3  Operation Stage
*  To prevent deterioration of natural environment components such as air, water, soil, noise etc.
.  To improve the safety of the highway users and roadside communities
C.3   MEETING THE EMP OB1ECTIVES
The following commitments are important to effectively implement the EMP and have been adopted to
address its various objectives.
C.3.1 Commitment to address environmental health, safety and social impacts
To improve the environmental conditions, including areas such as environmental health, safety and
social impacts, measures have been suggested as part of the EMP. Such measures will be continuously
developed as an interactive process.

C.3.2 Commitment for constant dialogue with the public and interested stakeholders
The community consultation process was carried out right from the inception stage of the project.
Continuous dialogue with local inhabitants and stakeholders including public agencies has been
established on various environmental issues to obtain their feedback. Consultation would continue
throughout the implementation stage of the project.
C.3.3 Commitment related to training
For the effective implementation of the EMP measures proposed, sustainable institutional arrangements
have been proposed. To educate and train the PIU, the personnel of the Construction Supervision
Consultants and the Contractors, an extensive training schedule has been worked out as part of the
EMP. The training programme will be implemented as per the schedule proposed.
C.3.4 Commitment to meet legal requirements
The legal requirements, procedures, etc., that are necessary or mandatory for the commencement of
the project have been met. The conditions stipulated by the various Statutory Authorities as the State
Pollution Control Boards, Forest Departments etc. will be complied with.
D.  CRITICAL IMPACTS TO BE ADDRESSED - PACKAGE III-C

F.  MONITORING PROGRAMME
The purpose of the monitoring programme is to ensure that the envisaged purpose of the project is
achieved and results in desired benefits to the target population. To ensure the effective
implementation of the EMP, it is essential that an effective monitoring programme be designed and
carried out. The broad objectives are
.. To evaluate the performance of mitigation measures proposed in the EMP
To evaluate the adequacy of Environmental Impact Assessment
To suggest improvements in management plan, if required
To enhance environmental quality
* To satisfy the legal and community obligations.
F.1   PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (PIS)
The physical, biological and social components identified as of particular significance in affecting the
environment at critical locations have been suggested as Performance Indicators (PIs), and are listed
below.
*  Air quality w.r.t SPM, RSPM and CO
*  Water quality w.r.t DO,BOD and Coliform count.
*  Noise levels around sensitive locations.
*  Replantation success / survival rate
*  Erosion indices
*  Restoration of borrow pits
*  Sedimentation rate in the downstream where bridges, culverts, etc are built
*  Vital statistics on health
i  Accident frequency
F.2   SELECTION OF INDICATORS FOR MONITORING
The environmental parameters that may be qualitatively and quantitatively measured and compared
over a period of time, due to their importance and the availability of standardised procedures and
expertise, have been selected as Performance Indicators (PIs).
*  Air Quality
*  Noise levels
*  Water Quality
•  Flora
•  Soil Contamination
The following sub-sections describe each of these PIs in detail.
F.2.1 Ambient Air Quality (AAQ) Monitoring
Ambient air quality parameters recommended for monitoring road transportation developments are
Respirable Particulate Matter (RPM), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM), Carbon Monoxide (CO),
Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Hydro-Carbons (HC), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) and Lead (Pb). These are to be
monitored at designated locations starting from the commencement of construction activity. Data
should be generated over three days at all identified locations in accordance to the National Ambient
Air Quality Standards formulated by MoEF in 1981.(Table 4) The location, duration and the pollution
parameters to be monitored and the responsible institutional arrangements are detailed out in the

F.2.3 Noise level Monitoring
The measurements for monitoring noise levels would be carried out at all designated locations along all
contract packages in accordance to the Ambient Noise Standards formulated by Central Pollution
Control Board (CPCB) in 1989 (refer Table 6) Sound pressure levels would be monitored on twenty-four
hour basis. Noise should be recorded at a "A" weighted frequency using a " slow time response mode"

F.2.4 Success of Revegetation
To ensure the proper maintenance and monitoring of the compensatory afforestation being carried out,
a regular maintenance and monitoring of the survival rate of the planted trees is being proposed upto a
period of 3 years from the operationalisation of the project. The responsible institutional arrangements
are presented in the Environmental Monitoring Plan (Table 7).
F.2.5 Soil Contamination
Contamination of the soil, especially due to increased levels of Pb, Cd and Cr are likely due to the
increased traffic movement on the project corridor. The comparison of the concentrations of these
parameters before and after the project coming up would aid in arriving at the increase in
concentrations of these heavy metals, if any.
F.3    MONITORING PLAN
The monitoring plan for the various performance indicators of the project in the construction and
operation stages is summarised in Table 7 below.
