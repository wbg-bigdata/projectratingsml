PLANTATION STRATEGY FOR TNHP
BACKGROUND:
The National Highway-2 is one of the oldest high density corridor in India,
connecting the two metropolitan cities New Delhi-Calcutta., The approximate 1400 km
long NH-2 is located on the upper Gangatic Plain in Northern India and traverses
through the states Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. Delhi to Agra section
at the western end and Dhanbad to Calcutta section at the Eastern End of the Corridor
are either already 4-laned or are in the process of being 4-laned. The remaining about
1000 km long corridor falling between Agra and Dhanbad is still two laned and is being
considered of four lnning under the proposed World Bank NH Project. The Third
National Highway Project aims at strengthening and four laning of 478 kms oiF selected
stretches between Agra to Dhanbad as per details given under Table 1. 1.

The stretch of NH-2 between package II-A and II-C has multiple rows of
various species on either sides such as Eucalyptus, Seesham, Jamun, Neem, Mango etc.
Package III has in addition to the trees mentioned above Bargad, Amaltas, &Gulmohar,
Mahua etc. Package. IV & V have similar kind of trees as mentioned in package II.
However in parts of the Package V teak, Sal, Kher are also found.
As a result of the project, the trees along the Highways are proposed to be cut
within the corridor of impact. The total no. of trees existing within the ROW is
1,81,851 of these about 36% of the trees would need to be felled due to the project. The
packages wise no. of trees to be felled are given in Table 1.2

The types of the impact on flora are as follows:-
loss of trees
loss of canopies
loss'of green tunnel
*     compaction of vegetation
*     pollution and dust accumulation on vegetation
The negative implication due to the cutting of the above trees needs to be taken
into consideration by compensating with new plantation along the proposed alignment,
on the median and on the cultural sites which are of importance to the community. The
plantations will not only enhance the aesthetic value of corridor but will also help in
abetting air and noise pollution.
OBJECTIVES:
One of the most effective, economical and useful remedies for control of
environmental pollution is tree plantation. Trees have innumerable direct and indirect
benefits of supplying timber and fuel at maturity. During their life time, they supply
fodder, fruits, seeds, help in soil and water conservation, offer shade and are oxygen
producing industries to combat ever increasing air pollution. Big foliage tTees also help
in reducing noise and dust pollution.
The main objectives of planting along the Highways are as follows:-
1.    To reduce the impacts of air pollution and dust as trees and shrubs are known to
be natural sink for air pollutants.



2.    To provide much needed shade on glaring hot roads during sumrner.
3.    To reduce the impact of ever increasing noise pollution caused due to increase in
number of vehicles.
4.    To arrest soil erosion at the embankment slopes.  ;
5.    For aesthetic enhancement of the project corridors and places of historical and
cultural importance by planting selective ornamental trees, landscaping and
turfing with grasses and shrubs.,
6.    Prevention of glare from the headlight of incoming vehicles.
7.    Development of forest resources at the resettled sites to meet the demands of
fuel wood, fodder and small timber of the local people.
CHOICE OF SPECIES
On account of indiscriminate plantings and thoughtless replacements, most of
the roadside avenues have become very much mixed. Owing to the difference in the
shape of their crowns and the rate of their growth, they have a patchy appearance and
from a distance present a jagged skyline. On the other hand, if a pure avenue of single
species is planted for a number of miles then it gives a harmonious and pleasing look. It
is, therefore, essential that mixtures of different species are avoided and pure avenues of
a single species are planted over long stretches of road. This will not only provide
aesthetic enhancement but will also render management more economical and re-
plantation easier.



The planting species are decided based on the physical growth characteristics of
trees, like form and shape, foliage patterm, growth rate, branching pattern, soil
characteristics and conditions of the strip like water logged areas etc.. The' first row
along the Highways will be of shade plants. Similarly, subsequent rows depending on
the availability of width Will comprise of ornamental and other species.
One of the main objectives of roadside avenue is to provide saide. Therefore,
the trees with following characteristics should be planted as shade trees:-
1.    Trees with high crown forms secure better visibility and are therefore
ideal.
2.    Trees that retain their foliage longest should be preferred to deciduous
trees.
3.    Trees with long gestation period and having rapid growth and a capacity
to resist fuingal and insects attack form ideal avenues.
4.    Long slender trees unable to support their own weight and trees with low
crown density decreasing visibility should be avoided.
5.    Fruit trees should generally be avoided with exception to Mango, Imli
Jamun as these form excellent avenues.
6.    Brittle trees, lie Millingtonia hortensis should not be planted as every
severe windstorm takes its toll from such trees and large branches lying
strewn over the road are menace to traffic.
7.    Species should be selected on the basis of soil and climatic conditions.
8.    Those trees should be preferred which provide thick shade and are also
valuable they should be preferred from economic point of view.



9.    Too often trees which are readily available, rather than those most
suitable are planted along roadsides. A careful selection of species is
worth striving for if it is remembered that these avenues are to last for
the, best part of a century.
10.   Localities susceptible to frost must be planted with frost hardy species.
11.   Exotics should be introduced only in town areas, where the care they
need can be bestowed on them but should be excluded from routine
roadside planting in the country side.
On better kind of soils viz. Loams most trees will establish themselves within
due time. It is the poorer types of soil, which often present a baffling problem. Thus,
usar [ alkaline] lands and heavy clays support little else beyond grass with a sprinkling
of dhak, babul, none of which afford satisfactory shade. The only species that have any
choice of success are Neem and Kanji. Excessively sandy areas are difficult to deal
with Shesham is the best species for such localities.
Species recommended as shade plants for roadside avenues are given below in
Table 1.3 It is to be mentioned that survival and growth of the plants depends on their
soil requirements.

PLANTATION SCHEME
The proposed plantation scheme has been broadly classified into 3 categories which are
as follows:-
(i)    Tree planting along the Highway
(ii)   Turfing with grasses and shrub planting on median
(iii) Plantation on cultural and historical sites which are of community interest.
A. TREE PLANTING ALONG THE HlGHWAYS:
The technical specification for planting along the Highways are as follows:-
(i)   Shade plant [first row]
*     Distance from edge of shoulder -       6 mts.
a     spacing between plant to plant-        12 mts.
*     Size of the pits                      Normal site - 60 x 60 x 60 cms.
*     For Alkaline soil [Usar] -             1.25 mts. deep x 0.35 cms dia [by
Augar]
*     Water logged areas    -                mounds with 60 cm top and 100 cm
base
height varying depending on the
water level.
*     Species recommended -                  as per table Nol .3
*     No. of plants perkm   -                84
*     Activity and time schedule-            As per table no... .1.5
*     Height of the plant    -               Not less than 2 rnts



[ii] 2nd and subsequent rows:
Distance from edge of shoulder
of 2iid row                                 9 mts
Subsequent rows                                   at a distance of 3 mts.
from 2nd row
Spacing between plant to plant       -            3 mts.
Size of the pits:
Normal site                          -            45 x 45 x 45 cms
Alkaline soil                        -            1.25 mts. deep x 0.35 cm dia
Water logged areas:                  -            mounds with specification as
given
ffr shade plants
Species recommended                               As per table No 1.4
No. of plants per km                             333 [ for each row]
Height of the plants                              more than I mts.
In localities where a really bad patch of usar occurs, there is a need to dug deep pits by
auger (mechanical device] to break the kankar pan down below and replacing the soil by good
quality soil. The soil amender Gypsum 1 to3 kg. depending on the pH along with 2 kg.
composite and sand are filled in the pits. The treatment helps in lowering down the pH and thus
enabling better survival of plants.
>  Haphazard mixture of various species just because they happen to be available
complicates subsequent management. Owing to variation both in the rate and form of



> growth of trees mixed, the avenues present a patchy appearance. It is therefore best
and most convenient to use the same species on either side of a road for at least 5 km
or so and secure regularly grown avenues of the same form and type. Such avenues
will mature at about the same time and can be replaced with minimum sacrifice.
>   An average spacing of 12 mts. requiring 84 plants per km. and will provide ample
growing space for most species. Too many trees apadt from involving higher planting
costs, very often unnecessarily reduce visibility for fast traffic. Excessive dense
avenues serve no useful purpose and apart from affecting the tree growth adversely.
It also reduces visibility and proves to be dangerous to fast moving traffic. Close
spacing on curves and crossing can be dangerous so best plan is to miss a tree or two
at such locations.
PROTECTION MEASURES:
* Where the availability of the width is only sufficient for single row plantation there
protection will be done by tree guards [Iron]/brick guard.
* For multiple row plantations, protection will be done by barbed wire fencing. Angle
iron will be fixed at a spacing of 5 mts. and 3 strand barbed wire will be stretched.
ON THIE MEDIAN
The surface on the median is to be prepared adequately for shrubs planting or grass
sowing. The grasses and shrubs planting is done to provide a strong surface cover but needs a
well-prepared surface. All masses of loose debris on the median should be removed. Any
convexities should be removed and similarly any concavities are to be filled by good soil. The
surface should have sufficient layer of good quality soil [ upto 45 cms] so as to have better
growth and survival of grasses and shrubs.



Grass lines are used to provide a strong surface cover but need a well-prepared surface in
which to be planted. If grass is to be an effective form, then it must be allowed to establish
properly on a slope which does not subject to undue stress from erosion and mass movement in
its initial stages.
* Sowing of grasses is intended to create a strengthened surface that is resistant to
erosion.
* It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the condition of the site is good
enough for the successful establishment of grasses.
* The contractor is required to supervise all field operations like preparation of surface,
sowing of grasses and quality of grasses seeds used.
* A cover of 25 grams of grass seed per square mt. of surface should be achieved.
The timing of sowing is of utmost importance.
*  The seed sowing must be carried out before the onset of monsoon [May & June] so
that they yield desired results. The watering of the surface will be above by tankers
till the onset of the monsoon.
* After sowing, mulch of prepared and dried out herbs should be laid over the whole
seeded area in a thin layer so that the direct sunlight and transpiration loss may not
afF-t tfe Grasses.
* The grasses recommended for median are Cynodon dactylon, Cythoclinc purpurea,
Solanum nigrum, Xanthium strumerium etc.

The plantation on the median will be the responsibility of the contractor. The plants will
be procured from the private nurseries. As the plantation activity will commence in July, 2002 so
the contractor can tie up with the private nurseries for obtaining the necessary plants. The
requirement of plants will be 666 per kn. and an additional 10% of for the mortality during
¶-is     U     1     --,1 L I   iIIU1A
.s   IL LLLL.    1JiJ.&.LLa.j i.
PLANTING MATERIAL:
Roadside avenues can be planted up by following:-
(a)   Entire transplant
(b)   Seedlings in polybags
(c)   Cuttings



ENTIRE TRANSPLANT:
* The plants are retained in the seed beds.
* At the time of planting, plants are carefully dug out with a ball of'earth.
* As far as possible, injury to the root system is avoided
* The ball of eastern around each plant can be kept in'place by a piece of gunning bag
or straw tied round by a piece of string. The transplants are to be kept moist during
transit.
* To avoid transpiration loss, except for the leaves on leading short all other leaves may
be snipped off with a sharp pair of scissors.
The advantage of transplantation is that very tall sized plants [ upto 3 mts] can be directly
planted on the roads and within a short period [ 2 - 3 years] a good avenue can be developed.
Species recommended are Azadirachta indica, Syzynium cuminii, Mangifera indica, Ficus
religiosa, Ficus glomerata, shisam, kanji etc.
2.    POLYTHENE BAG PLANTS:
Plants are grown in polythene bags in nurseries and are transplanted t1 the site.
Polythene sheet is removed before planting the saplings.
CUING:
Cuttings made from aerial roots and branches of species of ficus like Gular, Pakad and
Bargad generally stnke roots and rapidly establish themselves.



Conseration of Cultural and historical sites
Existing features along a road alignment whether natural or man made , can contribute
significantly to general road landscape and every effort should be made to preserve ,incorporate
and integrate these into the landscape. Reconnaissance survey should be made to identify all
valuable natural features such as ponds, steams, scenic vistas etc., in addition to man made
features like historical buildings, monuments etc. During design and later during construction
,every care should be taken to avoid damage to these. Certain species like Neem [Azadifachta
indica], Mango [ Mangifera indica], Mahua [Bassia latifolia] Pakur [Ficus infectoria] not only
provide thick shade but also have great capacity to absorb pollutants. These trees can act as noise.
barrier and are suitable for places like schools hospitals and other largest areas.
-     Near temple and other religious places, species like Peepal, Mahua, Mango, Neem
are preferred for better shade and religious values.
D     To minimize the soil erosion the slopes of the ponds which are of community
importance need to be stabilized by planting shrubs and trees like Jamun
[Syzinium cuminlil, Terminalia arjuna, Kachnar, Cassia fistula etc.
*     The landscape treatment of pond include provision of stepped access to the edge
of the water.
*     Providing flat boulders for washing
*     Stone pitching for slope stabilization towards roadside
*     Plantation of specified species of trees and shrubs for stabilization of pond edge.



Institutional Mechanism and Monitorin2
(i)   For each consultancy package there will be an Environmental Manager who will be
looking after the environmental activities before, during and after the construction.
(ii)   The environmental cell of the Corporate Office will coordinate monitor and administer
the activities relating to environmental issues.
(iii)   The plantation in the median will be the responsibility of contractors. To stabilize the
surface, the contractors will carry out turfing with grasses along with planting of low
height shrubs. The contractor will be accountable for the quaLity of the seedlings,
survival % and maintenance of the plantation.
(iv)    As the plantation activity will commence in the year 2002 - 2003, the  forest
Department will ensure the adequacy of plants before the beginning of plantation work.
(v)   Forest Deptt. will be raising the seedlings and the money pertaining to this can be borne
from the ( cost of plants) as mentioned in the scheduled rate.



(vi)  The rates proposed in work plan are based on the schedule rates of Forest Department,
quantum of work and the minimum wages. The Schedule rates of forest Deptt. will be
applicable where plantation will be done by forest Deptt. The forest Deptt. will follow the
same technical specification as specified in the tree plantation scheme.
(vii)  The plantation is a phased activity therefore the amount will not be released on lump sum
basis. The concerned Environmental Manager along with Forest Department &
Supervision Consultant will do the physical verification of the site. The contractor/forest
Deptt. will ensure 80% survival rate in the normal site and 70% in alkaline sites after the
end of fourth year.
The following activities will be verified:-
1 T yEAR                No. of pits
2N YEAR                  Survival % of saplings planted. [Quarterly]
3RD YEAR   -       [a]   Survival %  [before Casualty replacement]
[b]   Survival % [after Casualty replacement)
4TH YEAR   -       [a]   Survival % [before Casualty replacement]
[b3   Survival % [after Casualty replacement]



(viii) Release of Payment will be made to Forest Dept. after carrying out the physical
verification as given in table 1.9:
