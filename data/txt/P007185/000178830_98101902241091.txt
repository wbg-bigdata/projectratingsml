REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
EMPRESA GUATEMALTECA DE TELECOMUNICACIONES
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC
OF GUATEMALA
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
fo'r the equivalent of US$26.0 million to the Empresa Guatemalteca de Teleco-
murnicaciones with the guarantee of -the Republic of' Guatemala for a second
telecommunications project. The loan woiold have a termn of 20 years, including
4 years of grace, with interest at 6-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2..      A memorandum entitled "Memorandum on Recent Economic Development and
Prospects of Guatemala" wK IJ!. hb d-istributed to the Executllive Directors shortly.
A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.       Guatemala, one of the five countries in the Central American Common
Market area, has the largest population and the most varied physical environ-
ment among them. Mountains divide Guatemala into four main regions: the high-
lands, the Pacific coastal plain, the Atlantic area and the Peten. The var-
ious climates and the rich soils allow the cultivation of almost any type of
agricultural product. There are deposits of nickel that will be commercially
exploited with the participation of IFC, marble quarries of good potential
for exports, and some exploration for oil is being done. Guatemala's natural
beauty, climate, archeological rnonurnents, folklore and proximity to the
Un"ited States  give her a high potential for tourism development.
L;.      Most of the country's population and economic activity is in the
highlands.  The principal food crops -- corn and beans -- are grown here, and
mast of the cof'fee is grown on the southern highland slopes. Nearly all the
major urban centers and most of the country's industrial activities are located
in the highlands.  The Pacific coastal plain produces cotton, sugarcane,
cattle, rice and other tropical crops. The Atlantic area produces bananas
and sorne coffee. The Peten, which is the northernmost province, occupies
about a third of the country's area but is largely unexploited. It contains
the most important archeological monumentsof the Mayas and produces chicle
and some tropical woods.
5.       Guatemala's population has been growing at more than 2 percent per
annum and now totals about 5.2 million. The most significant characteristic



F the popujlation is its sharp ethnic division.  The pure Indians, who make
Lu) about 50 percent. of the total population, are economically, culturally
and linguistically separated i'rom the rest of the population, that is main-
ly of mixed Spanish and Indian origin.   A large part of the Indian popula-
Lion does not participate in the money economy.   They are engaged in sub-
sistence agriculture and have a standard of living well below that of the
rest of tne cconcmy.
As discussed in the economic memorandum, the economy has been grow-
ing at an average rate of 6.5 percent per annum for the past four years. The
main impetus for this growth, especially in 1972-73,were the good market con-
ditions for the leading exports of Guatemala. Provided the present western
world recession does not significantly weaken the country's traditional ex-
ports f'or a lengthy period of time, the economy can continue to grow in the
next few years at rates similar to those registered in the recent past.
7.        Although Central Government savings increased significantly in
1973, they attained a share of' only 1.4 percent of GDP.  Both current reve-
nues and expenditures remained at the very low level which has been charac-
teristic f'or Guatemala. Proposals made by the last administration during the
first half of 1974 to establish new export taxes and raise the rates of exist-
ing ones were substantially modified as they passed through Congress.As finaDy
enacted,new export taxes were introduced for sugar,beef and fish,and a more pro-
gressive sliding scale (tied to world price movements) was adopted for ex-
port taxes on the two most important export commodities, coffee and cotton.
The new law, however, established a very high minimum price subject to tax
lor the latter two commodities, and some government officials are concerned
that revenues from coffee and cotton might be reduced if the present prices
for these commodities are not maintained in the world market. In September
of 1974, the Congress approved an additional, less ambitious tax package
which includes increases in the stamp tax rate (from 1.5 percent to 2.0 per-
cent), the taxes on motor vehicles, the fees on passports, airport taxes,
taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, the tax on land (from 0.6 to
0.8 percent for those properties over Q50,000 wLith the minimum value subject to
tax being raised to Ql,000), and increases in personal and family exemptions.
It is expected that the September tax measures will yield additional reve-
nues of about Q26 million a year.
8.       Central Government investment reached Q74 million, or 2.9 percent
j'f GDP in 1973, which represents an all time high for Guatemala. Investment
in the social areas increased by more than 100 percent, especially in educa-
rion and health. Although investment expen6i'ture during, the earliy months of
_L14 ;ontinued at a high level, disbursements from the international financing
agencies were well behind schedule. This apparent anomaly suggests that
the high level of Government expenditure may have resulted more from Govern-
ment absorption of increases in project costs than from more rapid progress
in project execution.
9.       The Planning Council is currently preparing the Government invest-
mient program for the next five years  (and expects to have it ready -
-   ;;).     The intention is to maintain the agricultural sector as first
priority in the economy, paying particular attention to the most depressed
rural areas. Although there has been some improvement in the last year or
.tLJo, project preparation continues to be the main bottleneck, in the Central
Government and in the autonomous public agencies, to the achievement of higher



-3-
investment levels. Only a few entities operate on the basis of an up-to-
date investment plan, and those plans that do exist may be substantially
revised in the context of the overall plan. Further emphasis, therefore,
on project preparation will be an essential ingredient to the success of
the new investment program.
10.       The balance of payments has been in a strong position in recent
years, in particular in 1973, when foreign exchange reserves increased by
US$67.0 million and Central Bank reserves attained an all time high of
US$213.8 million at the end of the year. This was possible (despite an
increase of nearly 25 percent in imports) because of a substantial improve-
ment in the prices of coffee and cotton; an increase in sugar volume; and
an increase of more than 37 percent in the export value of manufactured
goods. Tourism continued its strong growth of previous years. The number
of tourists increased by 16 percent during 1973, while their expenditures
grew by nearly 50 percent. Preliminary estimates for 1974 would indicate
that although receipts from exports of goods and services increased. by
about 33 percent, payments for imports increased by about 60 percent. The
increase in export revenue originated mainly in price increases, while
the major factors responsible for the boost in import payments were fuel
price increases and speculative stockpiling of raw materials and interm,ite
goods,    which took place early in the year.   The net impact of these de-
velopments was a shift from a US$34.0 million current account surplus in
1973 to a US$75.0 million deficit in 1974, and a decline of about US$30.0
million in net reserves for the year.
11.       Over the medium-term, while coffee will continue to be the single
most important export, tourism is expected to continue to grow at a high
rate and become the second most important foreign exchange earner. The Gov-
ernment is giving high priority to the development of the sector, and the
private sector is already building new hotels and enlarging the existing
ones, which will add 1,000 first class rooms to the 1,200 available now in
that category. Manufactured products are expected to increase their share
of merchandise exports from 34 percent in 1973 to about 43 percent in 1980.
By 1977, nickel will be added to mineral exports, accounting for about 6
percent of merchandise exports thereafter. Although export volumes are
expected to grow somewhat faster than import volumes in the remainder of
the decade, because of expected further deterioration in the terms of trade,
payment on imports of goods and services are expected to increase as rapidly
as exports receipts.
12.       The rate of inflation which accelerated in the early months of
1974 appears to have tapered off later in the year attaining a level of
about 15 percent for the year as a whole (similar to the 1973 level). The
1974 inflation was due mainly to higher import prices for fuels and fertili-
zers. The large gain in foreign reserves during 1973 resulted in high li-
quidity in the banking system which extended into 1974. Moreover, the lower
internal interest rate, as well as the tight money market in the industrial
countries induced a switch from import financing by suppliers and foreign
financial institutions to financing by local banks. The increased credit
demand exceeded by far the expanded resources of the financial system and
started to spill over in the balance of payments. It was not until September



1974 that the authorities took action in the monetary field, increasing
interest rates, and cash and reserve requiremernts of the banking system.
These measures are expected to prevent further foreign reserve losses.
External Financing
13.       The external public debt repayable in foreign currency amounted
to US$192 million at the end of 1973, or US$11 million excluding undis-
bursed commitments. Guatemala's debt-service ratio has, in the past,
been relatively low and has been reduced further by last year's fast growth
in export value. Also, the average terms of the external public debt have
imnproved substantially over the last Lew years as a result of increased
lhorroXiing from international financial institutions.  A debt-service level
below 3 percent of total exports is expected to be maintained at least for
the remainder of the decade.
1a.      Apart from the Bank, external f'inancing has been provided princi-
pally by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (1DB) and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI).    IDB and CABEI funds have
carried very soft terms and contained large components repayable in local
currency.  Thre IDB has made loans for agriculture (general credit lines,
irrigation and fisheries), housing, transportationi, water supply and health
services. USAID has fi-nanced mainly rural development and primary education,
but has also granted loans f'or industrial development, rural electrification,
hcusing and health facilities.   CABEI has concentrated mainly on projects
with regional impact in highways, telecommunications, agriculture and in-
dacs try.

PART II -BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       Guatemala has received to date six Bank loans, totalling US$66.5
million net of cancellations. The last operation, a loan for a first tele-
communications project, amounting to US$16.0 million, was signed on January
5, 1972. A power project under consideration for FY73 was dropped follow-
ing a disagreement between Guatemala and the Bank on a proposed bid award
for two thermal generating units. Annex II contains a summary staternent of
Bank loans and IFC investments as of February 28, 1975, and notes on the ex-
ecution of ongoing projects.
17.       It is expected that the Bank's share of total external public debt
disbursed and outstanding will remain at about 20 percent on the average.
The Bank's share of debt service in 1974 was 11 percent; it is projected to
peak at 25.7 percent in 1979 and steadily decline thereafter. Moreover,
viewed in relation to exports, event at the peak year, the Bank's exposure
would be negligible. Total debt service for 1980 would be less than 3 per-
cent.
Ic.      Apart from the loan for a first telecommunications project, the
Bank has provided assistance through two loans for power amounting to US$22
'illion and one loan each for highways, education and livestock development.
After an initial loan for highwa.ys, made in 1955, the Bank suspended opera-
tions in Guatemala because of the failure of successive Guatemalan Govern-
nents to settle a dispute regarding three outstanding sterling bond issues.
Following settlement of the sterling debt, the Bank resumed lending to
Guatemala in 1967.
19.      In its future lending activities in Guatemala, the Bank is planning
to give increased emphasis to the rural sector.   As a first step in this
direction, we are presently participating in an analysis of Guatemala's agri-
cultural plans and programs, which is being conducted as part of a joint IBRD,
IDB and AID agricultural and rural survey of the five Central American
countries.   We hope through this process to identify specific rural develop-
ment projects and, more broadly, to help the Government to carry out its
expressed intention of giving first priority to rural sector development.
In education, we intend to continue assisting the Government to develop and
expand the comprehensive secondary school concept begun under the first Bank-
financed education project by providing assistance for a second education
project which we expect to present to the Executive Directors during FY76.
In infrastructure, the Bank would help in meeting the growing resource re-
quirements in power and telecommunications and in strengthening major insti-
tutions operating in the sector. In the power sector, the Bank is presently
having discussions with the Government and the power generating company con-
cerning Guatemala's future energy requirements and the possibility of pro-
viding financing for a major hydro-electric project. Given the size of the
envisaged power investment program, the Bank would also help to mobilize
the external financing required beyond what the Bank might be in a posit.ion
to considtr.

20.      IFC has made two investmnents in Guatemala.  The first, a US$200,000
loan in 1956 for a flour mill, has been fully repaid.  The second, a loan of
US$15.0 million to Exploraciones y Explotaciones Mineras Izabal, S.A.
(EXHIBAL), a Guatemalan company established to exploit a nickel ore deposit
at Lake Izabal in eastern Guatemala, was approved in July 1Q73.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN GUATEMALA
Development of the System
21.      Prior to 1971, the responsibility for providing telecommunicaitions
services was divided between three entities. Direcci6n General de Teleco-
municaciones (DGT) was responsible for national telephone operations. Em-
presa Guatemalteca de Telecomunicaciones Internacionales (GUATEL INT) was
responsible for international services and for telex; and Direccion de Co-
rreos y Telegrafos (DGCT) operated the domestic telegraph service. Follow-
ing recommendations of USAID consultants and in close consultation with the
Bank, the Government, in April 1971, approved a five-year expansion program
to improve and expand local and long-distance telecommunications facilities
and to rationalize the organization of the sector by merging DGT and GUATEL
INT. An autonomous entity (GUATEL) was made responsible for all public tple-
communications services in Guatemala except for existing domestic telegraph
service, which continued to be operated by DGCT.
22.      The local telephone network of Guatemala compriises 15 automatic
exchanges with a total installed capacity of L3,130 lines and about 40,LtO0
subscriber connections.  An additional 1.g00 subscribers are connected to
133 manual exchanges in the provinces. Ninety-two percent of GUATEL's network
is located in the metropolitan area of Guatemala City, with alnost all the
rest in the major secondary cities.
23.      At present, there is an average waiting tirne of at least two years
for telephone connections and a waiting list of some 26,100 applicants, in Guvte-
mala City; the total unsatisfied demand nationwide is estimated to be arcuna
6o,000. Guatemala has the second lowest (after Honduras) telephorne density
among the five Central American countries, i.e., 7.7 telephones per l,00G)
inhabitants.
24.      The long-distance network which links Guatemala City with the main
secondary cities consists mostly of open-wire lines, UNF/VFH radio systems
and cables; these links total about 11,000 circuit kilometers. A large micro-
wave network, which is scheduled to be in operation by 1975, should improve
the poor cuality of the existing long-distance service and increase the number
of trunk circuits by some 546 in 1976.   This should give sorne relief to the
presermtly congested network.
25.      As-for the international network, telephone services have been
greatly irnproved and rapidly increased since the inauguration of the Central
American Ticrowave (COMTELCA) network in November 1971. At present, there are



- 7 -
194 international circuits. The COMTELCA network has in operation 11 inter-
national telegraph and 24 international telex circuits. In 1974, the auto-
matic international telephone exchange was completed, making possible auto-
matic dialing to the USA, Mexico and to other Central American countries.
26.      GUATEL's first development plan, which is supported by the Bank's
first telecommunications project (Loan 792-GU of January 5, 1972), will
add some 38,110 lines to the local network by 1976, bringing total capa-
city to t:',2401ines.  After initial delays resulting from the reorganization
of the sector and lags in procurement which will delay the final completion
of the first development plan by about one and a half years, or until mid-
1976, substantial progress is now being made. All contracts for the purchase
of goods under the Bank's first project have now been signed.
27.      GUATEL's second development plan will partially overlap with tht?
first and will cover the years 1975-1981. Because of the scope of the second
plan, it has been divided into two phases, with the first phase,covering
1975-70, to be supported by the proposed Bank loan. IMajor objectives of the
1975-78 period are to improve the quality of existing service by relieving
coni7estion, to reduce the waiting list for telephone connections to one-
half its current level and to expand development of telecommunications services
in rural areas. While services in these areas are often initially unprofit-
able, they are considered justified by the econom.c   .enefi-;s  which imorovec
CC.2!,Icn±Gi :tions will  'r Ito the riza _ sfo.tor.
Regulatory System
26.      The overall policy control of the telecommunications sector is
the responsibility of the Ministry of Communications and Public Works. Coerdi-
nation of sector investment remains with the National Planning Council. The
law establishing GUATEL empowers its Board to set tariffs for its services
on the recommendation of the general manager. International tariffs and
related tariff-sharing are established by agreement between GUATEL and the
foreign entities concerned. GUATEL inherited certain tariff structure
anomalies. Government subscribers were charged the lowest monthly rental
with no additional charge for either long-distance or excess local calls.
Other rentals included a large number (400) of free, three-minute call
units per month which led to uneconomic and excessive usage. During nego-
tiations for the first Bank loan, GUATEL agreed to revise these tariffs.
Accordingly, subscriber categories are now limited to residential and non-
residential, without concessions to government subscribers. In the case oI
the free call units, GUATEL could not lower the number because of legal
constraints (sales contracts with a specified number of free calls), but has
improved the tariff structure by reducing the duration of the free units to
2-1/4 minutes. GUATEL's telephone tariffs are reasonable and are comparable
to those of other similar autonomous telecommunications entities in Central
America (e.g., El Salvador and Costa Rica).

PART IV - T-E PROJECT
PH.      A report entiLled I'Appraisal of' a Second Telecommunications Prr-
ject of Empresa GuatemalLeca de Telecomunicaciones (GUATEL)" (No. 683-GU
dated March 26,   1975)  is being distributed separately.   The main fea-
tures oi' thle loan are summarized in Annex III.  The project was prepared
by GUATEL and appraised in June-July 1974. Negotiations were held in
Washington f'rom February 24 to 27, 1975.  GUATEL was represented by Col. M.
Rayo Ovalle, General Manager; Dr. 0. Pontaza, Lic. J. C. Serrano, Lic. A.
Sandoval, Ing. F. Aragon and Ing. C.E. Zaparolli; the Governmernt was ie-
presented by Lic. H. Menendez de la Riva and Arc. A. de Russ.
The Borrower
30.      The borrower, Empresa Guatemalteca de Telecoimunicacicnes (GUJATEL),
is a government-owned corporation which, as mentioned in paragraph 21 above,
was established in 1971 af'ter the merger uf two telecomnunia;cations entitLies.
GUATEL is exempt from all taxes and is authorized to carry out its activi-
Lies autonomously.  It has a Board of Directors consisting of the following
five members: the Min,ister of Communications and Public Works; who serves as
Cnairman; che Minister of' Foreign Affairs;  the Minister of the Interior;
and two other directors appointed by the Presidernt oL' the Republic.  The
general manager, appointed by and responsible to the Board, is in charge of
all the administrative, financial and techmical activities of GUATEL.   There
are five departments divided along functional lines: administration, finance
op-rations, planning, and construction.   Each departrment is under the direct.i:ti
of a department head, who, in turn, is accountable to the general manager.1JA=E's
senior mona-ement is well qualified and has thenecessary management potential.
With the proposed expanded subscribers trunk dialing (STD) facilities
and the emerging fully automatic national telephone network, greater em-
phasis will need to be given to traffic engineering and network management.
GUATEL is in the process of setting up a traffic engineering organization
and procuring traffic measuring equipment to provide basic inf'ormation for
planning and supervision purposes.
31.       GUATEL has presently 1,627 full-tirme employees, which corresponds
to 36 employees per 1,000 telephones. GUATEL is expected to achieve a sub-
stantial expansion in the number of telephones in service beginning in 1976,
and it should be possible to reduce the present overall employee ratio of 36
per 1,000 telephones despite personnel increases needed to manage its expand-
ing operation. GUATEL has agreed to achieve an overall level of 24 employees
per 1,000 telephones by June 30, 1977, (Section 4.01(b) of the Loan Agreement).
Thus far, GUATEL has had no difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel.
Specialized telecommunications training has been provided by equipment sup-
pliers, ITU fellowships, and the regional telecommunications training center
(INCATEL) in El Salvador. However, to cope with the increasing needs of its
expanding facilities, GUATEL intends to establish its own training center.
GUATEL is preparing proposals to be reviewed with expert assistance specify-
ing the facilities and equipment needed and determining instructor require-
ments. The proposals will be made available to the Bank for comment within
sixty- days from the effective date of the loan.

Project Description
32.      The project covers the period from 1975 to 1978 and represent;
the first phase of GUATEL's 1975-dl Second Development Plan.    It cornsists
of the following:
(i) Increasing the local telephone exchange switching equipment
capacity by about 62,900 exchange lines, together with the
associated expansion of the cable network, distribution faci-
lities and buildings to permit connection of at least 640,00
direct exchange lines (DELs);
(ii)  Expanding long-dist-iico facilities, by miclowavo, VHL/UT*
radio, cable, and open wire systemss to provid- an atdditdiotl:t
722 trunk channels;
(iii)  Expanding the capacity of the international telephone ex-
change by 600 circuits and installation of a new main trunk
exchange with a final capacity of 3,000 circuits, equipped
for 1,200 circuits to cater to traffic growth and further -,m-
plementation of subscriber dialing;
(iv)  improving and expanding the rural telephone system to
cover an additional 86 locations by use of UHF/VHF radio
systems;
(v)  Expanding the telex n.-work by 2(; -lines: and
(vi)  Expanding training facilities, employing instructors and
technical consultants and purchasing of equipment   or the
proposed training center.
Cost Estimates and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$45.9 million, of
which US$32.9 million, or 72 percent, represents the foreign exchange costs.
With the proposed loan of US$26.0 million the Bank would finance 57 percent
of total project costs. US$4.96 million or 15 percent will be financed by
the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) through two loans.
(One loan of US$2.16 million which has already been approved is desi-jnee,-
expand Guatemala's inter-urban network. The. second loan of US$2.8
million is in an advanced stage of negotiations and is part of an overall
investment program of the Regional Technical Telecommunications Commission
(COMTELCA) for the expansion of the Central American microwave network, in
which the five Central American telecommunications companies participate.)
The remaining foreign costs of US$1.9 million and the local currency expend-
itures would be covered by GUATEL's own cash generation. The Government has
agreed that in case GUATEL would not have sufficient funds to assure the time-
ly completion of the project, including possible cost overruns, it would pro-
vide those funds in a manner satisfactory to the Government   and the Bank.
(Section 2.02 of the Guarantee Agreement).   To complete  financing   of
the ongoincg project, which is partly being financed by the first telecommu-
nications loan mentioned in paragraph 26 above, GUATEL is in the process o1'

and for a supplemental loan from CABEI of US$0.6 million. Authorization
and ratification of the bond issue and execution and delivery of the US$0.6
rmillion CABEI loan for the ongoing project and the US$2.16 million CABEI
loan for the inter-urban network are conditions of effectiveness to the
proposed Bank loan (Section &.0l(a) of the Loan Agreement). Failure to
obtain the US$2.8 million CABEI loan for the regional network and to ful--
fill all the conditions precedent to its effectiveness by June 30, 1976,
would be an event of suspension of the loan (Section 7.01(d) of the Loan
Agreement). A breakdown of costs by major components of the project is as
follows:

34.       GUATEL has already decided on the telephone and telex exchange capa-
cities and radio equipment terminals to be included in the project; the only
foreseeable quantity variation would be in categories affected by final design
and execution, such as cable for local network and civil works. Consequently,
physical contingencies were estimated at about 10 percent of the network por-
tion of local system expansion only, or US$1.43 million. Tne price contingency
allowance for the foreign exchange component was calculated at the rate of 10
percent per annum, and totals 14 percent of base cost plus physical contingencies.
Since contracts for most items to be included in the project are expected to be
signed by mid-1976 at the latest, these allowances are reasonable. A price
contingency allowance of 10 percent per annum has also been allowed for local
expenditures.
Prc-ject Execution
35.      The project will be carried out by GUATEL over a four-year period
and is expected to be completed by December 1978. GUATEL has the basic
planning, engineering and supervisory capacity to execute and operate the
project. As in the first Bank-financed project, the construction of larger
installations would be carried out mainly by contractors, with the assist-
ance and under the supervision of GUAI'EL. Consultants will be engaged,to
the extent necessary, to desi_;n the Guatemala City mriulti-exchange network.

Financial Position and Future Earnings of GUATEL
36.      The present financial situation of GUATEL is satisfactory.    In
1973 -- its first year of fully consolidated operation -- GUATEL realized
a revenue growth of 21 percent, while operating expenses increased 10 per-
cent. This resulted in net earnings of US$3.5 million, up 30 percent
from 1972. GUATEL's 1973 rate of return was 18.2 percent, a level well
above the 10 percent minimum agreed upon in the Bank loan agreement for the
first project. The high earnings together with a low long-term debt equity
ratio (26/72) allowed the utility to enjoy a comfortable liquidity position
and high debt service coverage, both indicative of ample borrowing capacity.
GUATEL has agreed, however, not to undertake during the project period major
ex-i-slion of its facilities unIdss a financing plantherefore has been      -
approved by the Bank (Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement). Major expansion
has been defined as capital expenditure exceeding Ql.0 million or 5 percent
of the previous year's capital expenditure, whichever is higher. GUATEL has
also agreed not t.o incur any long-term debt without the Bank's approval un-
less its most recent 12-month internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times
the maximum debt service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year (Sec-tion
5.07 of the Loan Agreement).
37.       In accordance with Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement for the
first telecommunications project GUATEL introduced certain tariff modifi-
cations to eliminate unjustified concessions to government subscribers
and to reduce a general and unduly high free use of telephone facilities.
The resulting increase in revenues has contributed substantially to GUATEL's
currently satisfactory financial situation. Also, in preparation for its
second development plan, GUATEL increased connection fees in June 1974 trom
Q100 to Q200 per subscriber in Guatemala City and Q170 in the provinces.
This tariff action was adopted to provide a rationing device as well as an
additional source of investment capital. In the past GUATEL credited its
entire connection fee of Q200 per telephone or telex subscriber to current
income. According to the decree by which GUATEL was established, the entity
is obligated to set aside 50 percent of annual net profits for distribution
to the Government (45 percent) and its employees (5 percent). On the basis
of this decree 45 percent of the connection fee was therefore passed on to
the Government. Conceptually, it should have been considered largely a
contribution to capital rather than to income. Accordingly, in December 1974,
GUATEL's Board of Directors adopted a resolution limiting the proportion of
the connection fees to be credited to current income to 25 percent for sub-
scribers in Guatemala City and 20 percent in the provinces; the balances will
be treated as subscribers capital contributions. In view of the importance
of these subscribers capital contributions to expansion financing GUATEL
agreed that suspension, repeal or amendment of the December 1974 resolution
will be cause for suspension of disbursements. (Section 7.01(b) of the Loan
Agreement.)
38.       During the project execution period, it is projected that, with the
maintenance of tariff levels, GUATEL's rate of return, though decreasing
would not fall below 13 percent; its debt service coverage would be satis-
factory, and its liquidity acceptable, despite the rapidly increasing indebted-
ness. The ratio of long-term debt to net utility plant would not exceed
two-thirds, which is considered reasonable. In order, however, to assure



- 12 -
a reasonable  contribution to the expansion program as well as its long-term
operation on a sound financial basis, GUATEL has also agreed to take such
tariff measures as shall be required to produce: (i) during the project period,
net operating revenues (after debt service and the transfer of net profits to
Government) equivalent to the following proportions of the total net fixed
assets at the end of each year, revalued frorm time to time in a manner acceptable
to the Bank: 6 percent in 19M75; 10 percent in 1976 and 1977, and 8 percent in
197T (Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement) and (ii) commencing in 1979, net c', -
rating income (after transfer of net profits to the Government and its employees,
but before interest and other charges on debt) sufficient to yield an annual
rate of return of not less than 11 percent on the average revalued net utility
plant in service (Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement).
39.      Procurement of all equipmeent and materials to be financed by the
proposed loan would be subject to internati-onal competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines, except for some switching equipment
(armounting to about US$200 mill,ion) for extending existing installations
w!here direct ccmpatibility is essential.  This ecuipmrent would be purchased
directly fromr the supplier with whom the original contract was placed as a
result of international competitive Yiddinc under the previ-ous Bank loan.
4i0.     in accordance with the Central Americarn Agreement. on Fiscal Incen-
tives for Iindustrial Development, suppliers from Central American Common
Market (CACM) ccuntries, includinrg Guatenmala, would receive a margin of
preference of 15 per cent of the c.i.f. price or 50 percent of the tariflf
o-vable by non-CACM manu,facturers, which-ver is lcwer.  The itemns likely to
be competitive under this arranmement are wood telephone poles, cables, and
ducts: the i cost is not expected to exceed US$2.5 million.
41.       Because of long procurement lead time, GUATEL has been permi6ted
to enter into commitments before approval of the proposed loan for goods
with a value of about US$3.0 million, which includes a commitment of US$2.0
million for direct purchases mentioned above. No retroactive financing would
be required.
Disbursement
42.       Disbursements under the loan would be for the c.i.f. costs of im-
ported goods, for the foreign expenditures of equipment installation, and
the foreign exchange costs of consultants' and training experts' services.
Because of the ongoing nature of Guatemala's telecommunication expansion,
any unused loan balance after project comnpletion could be applied, after
app-oval by the Bank, to the purchase of additional goods of a type similar
to those procured under the loan.

Economic Justification
43.       The choice of optimum design of the large works in the project
was based on present-value studies of the capital and operating costs of
engineering alternatives over a 20-year period, using a discount rate of
11 percent. For the remaining small works, GUATEL's engineers have used
present-value studies to obtain generalized solutions for each class of
plant and to reach decisions regarding the particular type and size to be
selected. On the basis of these studies, the project represents the least-
cost solution to meet GUATEL's needs.
44.       The projected financial rate of return on the project is about
18 percent. There is no doubt that the economic rate of return would
exceed the above level because (i) the prices charged for services do not
adequately measure the full benefits to subscribers; especially those in
commerce, industry and agriculture; and (ii) project costs include the
full costs of extending services to new areas, whereas the full benefits
would be obtained only when all potential subscribers in those areas were
connected.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Empresa Guatemal-
teca de Telecomunicaciones; the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
Republic of Guatemala and the Bank; the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan Agree-
ment and Guarantee Agreement conform to the normal pattern of loans for
telecommunications project. Special features of the draft Loan Agreement
are noted in paragraphs 33, 37 and 33 above.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

it necessary to extend the closing date to July 31, 1975.
Ln. 722           Livestock Project:   US$4.0 million of February 10, 1971:
Progress of this project has been slower than anticipated
and it is likely that disbursements will not be completed
until about one year after the original closing date of
December 31, 1975. Operations improved somewhat when
the Bank and the Borrower (Government of Guatemala) agreed
to extend the project area to include the Central Northern
and Atlantic Coastal regions in addition to the Pacific
Coast, but a handicap is the lack of participation by
banks other than the Government-owned National Agricultural
Development Bank (BANDESA). The banks are generally in
a fairly liquid position and apparently find it more pro-
fitable to lend their own funds for livestock as well as
for other ventures rather than use the funds available
under the project. Several banks have indicated their
interest in the discounting facilities offered under the
project if the sub-loans could be exempted from Government
regulations limiting their total lending to a multiple of
their own capital. The Bank is exploring this matter
with the Government.
Ln. 792          Telecommunications: US$16.0 million of January 5, 1972:
The status of this project is described in paragraph 26
above.
/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report arly problems which are
being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to
present a balanced evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.
