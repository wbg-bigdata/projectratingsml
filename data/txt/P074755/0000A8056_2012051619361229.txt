                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Development Objective (DO) of the Project is to support the improvement of institutional performance of judiciaries in a few states through BANOBRAS's credit
                         program for state judicial modernization by learning while doing. In these states, the Project would: (a) strengthen institutional capabilities, organizational culture and
                         knowledge; (b) strengthen efficiency and effectiveness of judicial services; (c) improve judicial transparency; (d) increase access to justice; and (e) support Project
                         coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and learning, including consultation with Project stakeholders.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Loan closed on December 31, 2011. The Mexico Federal District Judiciary (TSJDF) Subproject has been completed and an integrated information and communications ICT solution
                         to support the TSJDF's new management model is now operational in 69 courts in four key locations (Reclusorio Norte, Reclusorio Sur, Reclusorio Oriente, and Santa Marta Acatitla).
                         A single “turn-key? contract ensured that all the required inputs (ICT network, security mechanisms and physical infrastructure) were put in place at the same time in these separate
                         locations within the jurisdiction of the TSJDF. The implementation of the Action Plan for the full-fledged operation of the new management model in these courts as well as the

                         improvement of ICT systems to organize and centralize judicial information in order to provide timely and reliable information to individual courts and users has been completed. The
                         integrated ICT network became fully operational by June 30, 2011. In parallel, the TSJDF developed and updated the key court services that would be operating through this ICT
                         network, thereby effecting a major qualitative leap in TSJDF’s management model. 85% of the Loan balance has been disbursed.

                         The complementary NLTA program agreed upon with the TSJDF and the Federal District Government (GDF) to strengthen the institutional capacity of TSJDF has also been
                         completed: (i) the Rapid Data Gathering Program (Programa Acelerado de Datos-PAD) sponsored by the Bank and the OCDE (Paris 21) has allowed the TSJDF to develop modern
                         statistical data management tools, the first of its kind in LCR. An stand-alone funding proposal approved by Paris 21 was implemented in parallel with this Project; and (ii) in
                         conjunction with the IFC Doing Business team an FBS proposal was agreed with the Secretariat of the Economy of Mexico and the TSJDF to design an action plan to improve the
                         performance of the TSJDF with regard to the contract enforcement indicator.
