F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Loan Agreement)
The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower with the implementation of its
judicial modernization credit program by supporting the efforts of the Participating States
to: (a) strengthen justice sector institutions and promote cultural change and knowledge
sharing among such institutions and with civil society; (b) develop efficient and effective
judicial services; (c) increase judicial transparency; (d) enhance access to justice for the
poor and disadvantaged populations of the Participating States; and (e) disseminate good
practices and learning-by-doing strategies within and among Participating States; and
promote efficient monitoring and evaluation procedures, including consultation with
Project stakeholders.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

Not applicable. However, a first order restructuring was initiated but not completed to
narrow the PDO and reflect that only one sub- national (i.e., the DF) participated in the
Project.

 Qualitative)                                                       subproject financed
                                                                    under the Project (the
                 TSJDF Subproject:   TSJDF                          TSJDF’s) and the
                 0 user service      Subproject:                    surveys conducted,

  As this Project was structured as a credit line, the PAD included neither specific baseline nor target values
for the indicators but expected those values to be determined for the particular subprojects of individual
subnational applicants to the credit line. However, the PAD was prepared using the Logical Framework
methodology. As the Project ended up having only one subproject (the TSJDF’s), the baseline, targets and
achieved values presented here refer to those agreed for the TSJDF Subproject.

  The Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st Century (PARIS21) was founded in November
1999 by the United Nations, the European Commission, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, in response to the UN Economic and
Social Council resolution on the goals of the UN Conference on Development. The PARIS21 Consortium
was set up -- at a meeting hosted by the OECD Development Assistance Committee -- as a global
partnership of national, regional and international statisticians, analysts, policy-makers, development
professionals and other users of statistics. It is a forum and network to promote, influence and facilitate
statistical capacity development and the better use of statistics. PARIS21’s goal is to develop a culture of
Management for Development Results (MfDR). PARIS21 pursues this goal primarily by encouraging and
assisting low-income and lower middle income countries to design, implement, and monitor a National
Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS).

               With TSJDF’s own resources, the statistical information system largely exceeded
               expectations. It went beyond the target courts to cover all the 278 courts, 17
               justice support offices and 13 administrative offices of the TSJDF. It also
               generates the socio-economic information requested by INEGI, and has
               superseded manual completion of information forms per defendant. A paperless

             The integrated ICT network supports a new organizational and management
             model for target trial courts. The Project supported ICT applications allow the
             preparation of monthly statistical reports to monitor case processing times and
             clearance rates. The ICT applications have incorporated a human rights red flag

              The increased demand for statistical information has prompted the TSJDF to
              finance several community engagement activities with its own resources to
              expand links between the Judiciary and civil society. With technical support from
              the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights they have developed
              fair trial/due process indicators. Also with FLACSO, the TSJDF carried out a

      1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Institutional Context of State Courts

1.      Mexico’s justice system is structured in two tiers: State and Federal. The state
system is comprised of 31 state courts and the courts of the Federal District, each with its
respective ancillary institutions (Attorney General’s Office, Ombudsperson’s Office).
The courts generally handle matters including amparos3 from state court systems, and
labor, agrarian, fiscal, bankruptcy etc. The legal framework for the court system is
detailed in the Federal Constitution of Mexico, state constitutions, the Organic Laws of
the state court systems, as well as procedural laws regarding civil, family and criminal
matters.

2.      State courts and other state justice sector agencies are independent of the
federal system. At the time of the appraisal, there were a total of about 6,000 judges in
Mexico including both Federal and state systems (justices, judges, judges of the peace
etc.) This is about one judge for every 16,800 persons. About 3,600 belonged to the state
judicial branches (about 28,000 persons per judge), and the rest to the federal judicial
branch and administrative courts at the federal and state levels.

3.      The state court systems lacked adequate financial, human and other
resources to meet the accumulated and growing demand, and the social and
economic needs of the population. State courts’ were weaker than the federal courts.
The overall judicial system received about 1 million new cases per year, including civil,
family and criminal matters. At the time of appraisal, reviews indicated that about 80% of
all judicial cases in Mexico, or some 800,000, were handled by state court systems. The
typical proportion of cases heard in state courts was 60% civil, 20% family, and 20%
criminal, respectively.

4.     The weaknesses of the state court systems were divided into external and
internal problems. The external weaknesses identified included: low public confidence
in the courts, subordination of state courts to the federal courts through the use of
amparo, confusion regarding the jurisdiction of judicial authorities in commercial cases,
among others. The internal weaknesses included poorly designed policies, weak judicial
independence (due to occasional problems with political and media pressures), weak
monitoring of professional performance, lack of institutional capacity and resources, and
overly formal and deficient procedures that stemmed from a lack of adequate and up-to-

date legal frameworks. Functional weaknesses included inadequate case management,
significant caseload delays, insufficient statistical registries, inefficient bailiff and clerk
operations and supervision, and uneven workload distribution, among others.

5.      In response to these issues, some states had already advanced judicial
modernization efforts, although with limited impact. Various States were in
different stages of implementation. However, across the board there were institutional
problems such as weak strategic planning and capacity. There was also a need for better
measurement of results, appropriate incentives for change, citizen participation and
sharing of good practices and knowledge so that the pace and impact of modernization
efforts could be improved nation-wide. Weak coordination and learning also affected
most judiciaries.

6.      The State Judicial Modernization Project was designed after a detailed
diagnosis of the weaknesses of state courts. This was based on the inputs from
consultative workshops with state court judges and administrators in sixteen (16)
different state courts as well as consultations with users, and the review of prior studies.
Consequently, the Project was built around the following six strategic choices. They were
to:
     Focus on a few states and support institutional development of the judiciaries
        through the provision of a flexible set of judicial modernization building blocks to
        develop strategies;
     Promote the development and implementation of integrated state judicial branch
        modernization plans with a participatory “learning while doing? approach. The
        aim was to ensure demand-driven commitment, provide real impact assistance for
        results, and adopt a flexible approach for project development and
        implementation. This was also key to overcoming resistance to change, and
        building judicial leadership. Although time consuming, this approach was
        considered best suited to such complex changes as reforming and modernizing
        judiciaries. This approach could help promote synergies among states and
        judicial institutions, and contribute to saving costs;
     Adopt a flexible approach for Project development and implementation because
        of the need for open-endedness in addressing 32 states with diverse interests and
        requirements, as well as to overcome the resistance to change and ensure the
        commitment of the judicial leadership;
     Leverage partnerships where possible, especially for access to justice and
        transparency related activities. A broad and innovative set of measures would be
        promoted by Participating States under the modernization plans, with special
        emphasis on the assessment of disparities (supply and demand gaps) and building
        partnerships between judicial branches, Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios
        Publicos (BANOBRAS), Comisión Nacional de Tribunales Estatales
        (CONATRIB) and national universities with public, private and social institutions
        at all levels to begin to address this major challenge. BANOBRAS, a
        decentralized federal financial institution and development bank, focused on
        financing major public sector investments in Mexico at the subnational level, was
        selected as the main counterpart for the implementation of the overall credit line.


                                              2
      To concentrate on knowledge-sharing and transparency of information to help
       raise awareness, build consensus, generate support, improve the knowledge base
       for reform, and deepen understanding of the state courts’ roles in social and
       economic development;
      To develop capacity of BANOBRAS in a new sector, through semiannual
       implementation reviews to be conducted in collaboration with CONATRIB and
       others.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

7.      The PDO was closely aligned with the improvement of the institutional
performance of state judiciaries. According to the PAD, the PDO was “to support the
improvement of institutional performance of judiciaries in a few states through
BANOBRAS's credit program for state judicial modernization by learning while doing.
In these states, the Project would: (a) strengthen institutional capabilities, organizational
culture and knowledge; (b) strengthen efficiency and effectiveness of judicial services;
(c) improve judicial transparency; (d) increase access to justice; and (e) support Project
coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and learning, including consultation with
Project stakeholders.? The key performance indicators identified in the PAD include
stakeholder satisfaction on the efficacy of modernization activities and improved capacity
building and communication practices.

8.      On the other hand, the Loan Agreement provides a slightly different
formulation of the PDO. “The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower with the
implementation of its judicial modernization credit program by supporting the efforts of
the Participating States to: (a) strengthen justice sector institutions and promote cultural
change and knowledge sharing among such institutions and with civil society; (b)
develop efficient and effective judicial services; (c) increase judicial transparency; (d)
enhance access to justice for the poor and disadvantaged populations of the Participating
States; and (e) disseminate good practices and learning-by-doing strategies within and
among Participating States; and promote efficient monitoring and evaluation procedures,
including consultation with Project stakeholders.?

9.       For purposes of this ICR, the project performance will be assessed on the
basis of the Loan Agreement PDO formulation. While there is no substantial
difference between the formulation of the PDO in both documents, in consultation with
the Bank’s Legal Vice Presidency it was determined that the Loan Agreement is the only
legally-binding document, and the PDO stated therein had to be tracked during Project
life. Moreover, as opposed to the PAD prepared by Bank staff, the Loan Agreement was
negotiated with BANOBRAS (the Borrower) leading to a slightly more specific
formulation of the PDO that provided adequate parameters about the operation of the
credit program (support effort of participating subnationals) and its potential beneficiaries
(the poor and disadvantaged for access to justice activities) that could serve as better
basis for measuring results.




                                             3
1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.     The PDO was not revised but a Tier I restructuring process was advanced to
that end. Even though the Bank project team, BANOBRAS, the Government of the
Federal District (GDF) and the TSJDF worked for more than a year on a level 1
restructuring, this proposal was not approved. By May 2009, it was determined that the
only participating state would be the Federal District (DF) that had selected only few of
the activities included in the broad ‘menu’ provided by the project appraisal document
(PAD). At that time the Bank project team started a level 1 restructuring process. The
proposed restructuring would have updated the original PDO to reflect the objectives of
the only State Judicial Modernization Plan financed by the project. As a consequence, the
project team and the country partners intended to narrow down the PDO to “assist the
Borrower with the implementation of its judicial modernization credit program by
supporting the efforts to: (a) strengthen justice sector institutions; (b) develop efficient
and effective judicial services; (c) increase judicial transparency; and (d) facilitate
efficient monitoring and evaluation processes.? After protracted discussions with
BANOBRAS, the GDF and the TSJDF, until May 2011, the project team prepared a
restructuring package that was circulated for clearance in June 2011, including the draft
Amendment to the Loan Agreement prepared by LEG.

11.     Nevertheless, the Bank decided to suspend the restructuring process in July
2011 and then cancelled it in September 2011. As it was by then less than six months
before the Closing Date (December 31, 2011) and with most of the disbursements already
made, the value-added of pursuing a restructuring would be minimal.4 The processing of
the restructuring was delayed by protracted discussions on the draft legal amendments
between BANOBRAS and the Bank in order to correct flaws in the Project design at
entry.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     The main beneficiaries of the Project were the staff and users of the targeted
courts, although some benefits were also designed to reach the wider population of
the target areas. For the efficiency and effectiveness activities financed by the project,
the beneficiaries were users of justice services coordinated by the court offices of the
participating judiciaries. Similarly, the beneficiaries of the transparency and
accountability activities were all state citizens, as that component was designed to
strengthen the capacity of the state level. In the end, as the only participating judiciary
was the TSJDF, a total of 69 courts, their users and population served were targeted by
the project. This Subproject in one of the largest metropolitan areas of the World with the
TSJDF court system serving a total population of more than 10 million. With regards to

the promotion of the program at a sub-national level, the Bank, SHCP and BANOBRAS
organized 16 workshops on Judicial Modernization, in which state-level authorities
(Governors and Secretaries of Finance) and high-level authorities from the state’s
judiciaries (Magistrados) participated. These workshops were aimed to invite local
authorities to join the Program through a credit line offered by BANOBRAS. Although
the promotion of the program was intense and remained as a continued effort along three
years, covering from 2005 to 2008, only one participating state the Federal District was
incorporated to the program.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

       A. Strengthening institutional improvement, organizational culture and knowledge
          diffusion (Appraisal US$ 7.5 million, Actual US$ 3.38million)5

13.     Component 1 emphasized strengthening institutional capabilities,
development of a culture of service and increasing knowledge about justice
institutions and their operations. It also included strengthening jurisdictional processes
and raising awareness of the judicial function. It could potentially encompass: (a)
improvement of the capabilities of judges and staff in such areas as strategic planning and
budget programming, judicial organization, technology use, dissemination of institutional
innovations, sharing modernization plans with stakeholders, encouragement of civil
society to participate in the evaluation and feedback on institutional transformations and
impacts; (b) awareness raising of judicial operators to act consistently with a culture of
service and continuous improvement by focusing on human resources, knowledge
development, leadership development for change management and promotion of public
outreach and educational campaigns; and (c) sharing knowledge with local, national and
international judiciaries and other institutions involved in judicial modernization. The
specific activities were to be identified in the state Judicial Modernization Plan of each
participating state.

       B. Improving efficiency and effectiveness of judicial services (Appraisal US$ 13
          million, Actual US$ 5.91million)

14.     Component 2 addressed improving the efficiency of judicial branches and the
effectiveness of judicial decisions to raise productivity and quality while reducing
costs and delays. It could potentially encompass: (a) the better design, follow-up, control
and evaluation of judicial policies with respect to jurisdictional and administrative
management; (b) improvement of the judicial branch management model, procedures and
organization through reorganizing functions, optimizing and rationalizing the use of
resources, developing new working methods, systematizing jurisdictional and
administrative procedures, defining case backlog reduction programs, and rationalization
of case distribution among courts; (c) design and implementation of a judicial career

                                                        5
system with emphasis on professional development and independence, with suitable
incentive systems; (d) systematization and automation of procedures focused on case
management and documentation for the Superior Tribunal of Justice, first instance courts
and other courts, and finance and human resources systems for the Judicial Branch’s
administrative structure and/or Judicial Councils; (e) development of training, research,
information and document centers for judges and operators at all levels; (f) development
of information for decision making and interpretation; (g) provision of equipment and
infrastructure for designing and implementing of ICT plans with comprehensive
information and technical specifications; (h) design and implementation of plans for
construction, rehabilitation and remodeling of courthouses and judicial offices; and
assistance for pre-investment studies on further enhancement of the efficiency and
efficacy of the Judicial Branch. Specific activities would be identified in each state
Judicial Modernization Plan.

   C. Increasing judicial transparency (Appraisal US$ 4.5 million, Actual US$ 2.03
      million)

15.     Component 3 was designed to promote judicial transparency. This block
could potentially encompass: (a) creation of new or the strengthening of existing
organizational units responsible for the dissemination of information about jurisdictional
and administrative procedures, and for the management of judicial documentation to
support judges and judicial operators, including the establishment of judicial information
and documentation centers and information and citizen orientation offices; the carrying
out of outreach campaigns to provide information about the functioning and structure of
the judicial system; and the development of annual performance reports by the Judiciaries
including relevant auxiliary institutions; (b) development of discipline and accountability
mechanisms for judges and judicial operators by developing a Judicial Code of Ethics
and appropriate sanction mechanisms, a system for the receipt of complaints against
judicial operators and documenting the outcome of investigations, accountability
mechanisms for personnel of the Judicial Branch; (c) organizing events disseminating the
benefits of an enhanced transparency of judicial processes, such as, the strengthening of
oral trials; and (d) carrying out studies and research on improving transparency about
discipline systems, access to information, accountability systems and judicial ethics.
Specific activities had to be identified in the particular state Judicial Modernization Plans.

   D. Strengthening access to justice for all users(Appraisal US$ 5.0 million, Actual
      US$ 2.25 million)

16.     Component 4 would increase accessibility to justice administration by
reducing barriers to services. This block could potentially encompass: (a) development
of special programs for women, minors, indigenous peoples and other poor and socially
disadvantaged users of the judicial services and small entrepreneurs, such as outreach
events to provide citizens with a greater understanding of the judicial branch, of their
rights and responsibilities, and help judges to gain a greater understanding of the realities
of their social context; school orientation and education programs for children and
adolescents to gain a greater understanding of justice administration; and community



                                              6
outreach seminars on gender-based violence; promoting a gender dimension of judicial
systems; and access to justice for indigenous populations; (b) creation of new, or the
strengthening of existing alternative dispute resolution institutional mechanisms,
including awareness-raising and educational campaigns; (c) development of innovative
programs aimed at diversifying the range of judicial services, such as strengthening of
existing small claims justice at the municipal level, creation of mobile small claims courts
in judicial districts, and establishment of citizen information and orientation centers; (d)
development of training programs for public defenders, legal aid providers and staff of
public prosecutor’s offices, including the development of a pilot legal aid and orientation
program, and the organization of workshops and seminars to develop public consensus on
problems facing the Judiciary; (e) development of programs to improve the interactions
between the Judiciary and legal professionals, including private attorneys and bar
associations; and (f) carrying out of studies for the strengthening of access to justice for
the public at large, with special emphasis on the poor and disadvantaged populations.
Specific activities eligible for financing would be determine in the State Judicial
Modernization Plans.

   E. Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), and Learning
      (Appraisal US$ 5.0 million, Actual: component dropped)

17.     Component 5 would support standard coordination, and monitoring and
evaluation activities. The component was divided in two areas: (i) support for the design
and operation of the state PCUs, promotion of good practices and knowledge sharing and
(ii) support for strengthening BANOBRAS’s capability to supervise the Project, conduct
semi-annual M&E reviews, promote learning and prepare future projects.

1.6. Revised Components

18.    Component 5 was dropped as part of the 2008 restructuring and was never
implemented.       The rationale for this restructuring was that the BANOBRAS
organizational structure (designed to support large infrastructure investments at the state
and local levels) and internal financial policies (not to assume financial liabilities to
support routine credit management activities) were not consistent with the scope and
concept of this component. Instead, it was agreed the Bank’s and BANOBRAS’ usual
monitoring and evaluation policies and procedures would be applied to the State Judicial
Modernization Plans, and that specific M&E activities would be included as part of such
Plans for the sub-nationals to carry such activities with their own resources. The
proceeds of the loan being allocated to this component were transferred to Component 2
(Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness of Judicial Services).

19.    In conjunction with SHCP, BANOBRAS, GDF and TSJDF, the Bank project
team intended to revise the description of the project to align it with the TSJDF
subproject. The restructuring intended to reflect the fact that only one Judicial
Modernization Plan (the TSJDF’s) would be financed and the PDO and project
description of 2004 were significantly broader than the limited scope of the TSJDF
subproject. However, this restructuring was not finalized for reasons discussed in



                                             7
paragraph 10 above. The proposed restructuring would have substantially narrowed down
the scope of BANOBRAS credit line financed by the Project. Only activities that had
been effectively selected by the single participating judiciary (the TSJDF) would have
been left in the project description and would have been condensed into three
components on (i) Strengthening Institutional Capabilities, Culture and Knowledge; (ii)
Efficiency and Effectiveness of Judicial Services; and (iii) Increasing Judicial
Transparency.

1.7. Other significant changes

20.     The Loan Agreement was amended four times: (a) on January 19, 2007 to
amend the currency conversion letter; (b) on September 4, 2008 to: (i) increase the
percentage of financing under the Loan through the adoption of Mexico’s Country
Financing Parameters; (ii) cancel Component 5; (iii) reallocate the proceeds of the Loan;
(iv) extend the Closing Date to December 31, 2011; and (v) increase the amount of the
Authorized Allocation of the Special Account; (c) on July 2, 2009, to accept
BANOBRAS’ request for cancellation of the amount of US$16.5 million from the
unwithdrawn Loan balance effective as of May 4, 2009, thereby reducing the total Loan
amount to US$13.5 million reallocating the proceeds of the Loan; and (d) on January 19,
2010 to include the provision of works’ supervision as eligible works under subprojects.
The Project was only extended once from the original closing date of September 30, 2010
to December 31, 2011.

21.     In the original design, the eligible Subprojects would have had two sources of
funding: the BANOBRAS credit line and the cash/in-kind contributions of the
participating Sub-nationals. In the particular case of the GDF/TSJDF Subproject, the
Federal Government rules on the use of public debt limited the Bank/BANOBRAS
financing to goods and works. As a consequence, as part of the Subproject arrangements
entered into between BANOBRAS and the GDF/TSJDF it was agreed that the
GDF/TSJDF would finance with its own resources the technical assistance needed to
carry out the non-work and non-good portion of the TSJDF Judicial Modernization Plan,
in particular the advisory services required to make the integrated ICT solution
operational.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22.    This ICR considers the preparation, design and quality at entry
unsatisfactory although the preparation and design of the project were highly
participatory in nature. They included consultative workshops with judges,
administrators in five (5) state courts as well as consultations with users, and the review
of prior studies, thereby providing broad diagnosis of the weaknesses of these state
courts. Bank coordination for consultations, with states was made through the
CONATRIB in liaison with the SHCP and BANOBRAS. This collaboration continued




                                            8
during Project implementation, including additional consultation workshops in nine (9)
state courts.

23.     The Project suffered from serious delays in signature and effectiveness. The
Project was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on July 1, 2004 and the Loan
Agreement was signed in November 21, 2005 and became effective in January 25, 2006.
The project did not have effectiveness conditions but signature was delayed for almost a
year and half after Board approval because: (a) this was one of the first loans processed
under an innovative financial design (a foreign currency loan convertible to local
currency) that required initial fine-tuning by the Bank’s Treasury; and (b) while the
interest of the potential participating states was not confirmed, BANOBRAS preferred
not to incur in commitment fees for a loan that it was not sure it could pass through to the
states under the credit line, until the subloans were entered into.

24.     More seriously, the project was not ready for implementation. Project design
had various weaknesses that delayed implementation. Main design issues were related to
coordination between State Governments and Judiciaries, creditworthiness and financial
terms and conditions, and BANOBRAS business focus. The Project was originally
designed to provide support to Participating States for the implementation of their
respective Judicial Modernization Plans. Sixteen (16) Modernization Plans were prepared
(with Bank support) between 2003 and 2006. However, until the DF signaled its interest
to access the BANOBRAS credit program in November 2006 (one year after signing), the
Borrower had been unable to confirm the interest of any state in taking a sub-loan. The
main reasons for reluctance by the states to participate were: (a) coordination between
State Governments and Judiciaries, While the State Judiciaries were fully engaged by the
Bank during the preparation of the Judicial Modernization Plans, failure to coordinate
with the executive branches of the State governments, which are legally responsible for
the financial decisions was reflected in limited or no interest in taking sub-loans even by
the five (5) initial candidates; (b) creditworthiness, financial terms and conditions of the
Loan: some initial candidates were not creditworthy, while others had alternative sources
of financing at a cost lower than the cost of borrowing from the BANOBRAS credit
program. At that time, the financial markets reference rate resulting from the currency
conversion determined a relatively higher financial cost for the program; (c)
BANOBRAS business focus: BANOBRAS lacked expertise and capacity to promote
judicial reform Projects as it traditionally dealt with large infrastructure projects and was
not in a position to establish a specialized unit to handle this type of projects.

25.     The DF was the only sub-national jurisdiction that confirmed its interest in
the BANOBRAS credit line. The Project was originally designed for an implementation
period of five (5) years from 2005 to 2010. However, because of scarce interest among
the States in benefitting from BANOBRAS’ credit line for judicial modernization, by
November 2006, only one, the DF had confirmed its interest. Nevertheless, it took two
years to formalize an agreement between BANOBRAS, and the GDF and the TSJDF
because of: a) changes in GDF’s authorities as a result of the electoral cycle, b)
negotiations of financial costs issues between the Bank, BANOBRAS and GDF; and (c)
the stringent rules established by SHCP on projects financed by GDF debt and



                                             9
guaranteed by the Federal Government, that included a requirement for a cost-benefit
analysis – a critical aspect that had not been considered at the time of appraisal6. After the
financing cost issue was resolved by the Bank providing complementary technical
assistance to off-set the high cost of borrowing (see discussion on paragraph 27), SHCP
requirements were complied with, the sub-loan was signed in December 2008, ICB
procurement process for the turn-key contract for infrastructure and information and
communication technology (ICT) was initiated in early 2009 with contract signature on
January 2010 that allowed project implementation to start.

26.      Furthermore, Component 5 had to be dropped because of BANOBRAS
internal financial policies. These policies do not allow debt to finance activities related
with credit processing that BANOBRAS typically carries out with its own resources
(technical assistance or consultants’ services - typical inputs of monitoring and evaluation
activities) – a constraint that should have been identified at Project preparation. The
Project’s monitoring and evaluation design was also weak. The performance indicators
identified in the PAD lacked sufficient specificity which compounded with the lack of
baseline and target values did not provide for proper guidance on how to monitor and
evaluate progress towards achieving the PDO.

2.2 Implementation

27.     The Federal Government’s commitment with state justice systems
modernization was critical at a point when cancellation was being seriously
considered. After the August 2007 mission, the Project’s performance was rated
unsatisfactory by the Bank and the possibility of cancellation was considered. However,
during the October 2007 meeting of the National Association of Judicial Operators
(AMIJ), President Calderon reiterated the Federal Government’s commitment to State
judicial modernization, and publicly requested BANOBRAS to establish the appropriate
mechanisms to activate the Bank-financed Project to strengthen the States’ Judicial
Branches. SHCP took the lead on the Federal Government side to accomplish this policy
objective in conjunction with BANOBRAS. However, the only potential client with a
strong interest in a sub-loan (the GDF/TSJDF) still faced the issue of the high financial
costs. As a result of a joint effort (BANOBRAS, SHCP, GDF, TSJDF, and the Bank) a
mutually satisfactory resolution of this issue was reached (by the Bank setting off part of
the financial costs through a complementary technical assistance package), while internal
legal requirements for the sub-loan were met through the preparation of the cost-benefit
analysis.

28.    To rescue a Project that had no disbursements for three years, the Bank had
to develop a multi-faceted strategy that addressed design and implementation issues
in FY2008. Main elements of that strategy were the following: (a) processed a

http://www.shcp.gob.mx/INGRESOS/Ingresos_ley/2012/lif_2012.pdf




                                                   10
restructuring to modify some key aspects of Project design that had became dated after a
long period of inactivity, basically some financial covenants, the cancellation of a
component that was supposed to be implemented directly by BANOBRAS (mainly
monitoring and evaluation, and learning activities among Participating States) and the
extension of the Closing Date to December 31, 2011; (b) to offset the high financial cost
of borrowing from BANOBRAS, the Bank developed an additional technical assistance
program for the TSJDF on criminal justice to strengthen institutional capacities to
implement an ambitious criminal reform package (comprising study tours, workshops
and visits of top-notch international experts) that delivered the blueprint of a reform
implementation plan; (c) facilitated the TSJDF engagement in a complementary program
sponsored by the Bank and OECD (Paris 21) to strengthen its capacity to generate and
analyze quality statistical information relevant for managerial decision-making processes;
and (d) processed the cancellation of US16.5 million from the Loan balance.

29.     As the only sub-national jurisdiction that agreed to participate in the
BANOBRAS’ credit line, the GDF/TSJDF exercised their right to select just a few of
the activities eligible for financing under the Project. The TSJDF Subproject therefore
focused on the financing of the infrastructure remodeling (no construction envisaged) and
information and communication technology (ICT) equipment required as a platform for
the operation of an integrated network for the effective operation of key court services to
users that complemented the TSJDF modernization efforts. Due to constraints imposed
by the internal regulations of SHCP for the GDF public debt, the TSJDF Subproject
could not finance technical assistance or training out of Project funding but the TSJDF
agreed to conduct the support activities required for the operation of the integrated
network with its own budget resources.

30.    The GDF was the most important sub-national the Project could have ever
engaged in terms of the size and complexity of the DF Judicial Branch, the number
of cases and users. Within the framework of the overall Project, significant impacts and
outcomes were expected from the successful implementation of this Subproject in one of
the largest metropolitan areas of the world with the TSJDF courts serving a total
population of more than 10 million. The project was highly focused on ICT solutions for
the benefit of TSJDF court users located in urban low-income areas.

31.     Given the significant delays in subproject processing, the TSJDF adopted an
innovative approach to procurement of works, goods and services through a single
turn-key package. The GDF sub-loan was finally signed on December 19, 2008 and the
implementation of the DF Judicial Modernization Plan started in January 2009, under an
innovative “turn-key? approach that consolidated infrastructure and ICT investments into
a single International Competitive Bidding (ICB) package, thus avoiding fragmentation
in the procurement processes. This single contract was awarded in October 2009 and
started implementation in January 2010. Contract implementation proceeded smoothly
and was completed in December 2011 allowing 100% disbursement of the subloan.

32.    The Bank Project team the Federal Government and BANOBRAS were
conscious that a very old PAD had to be thoroughly updated to reflect the reality of



                                            11
the Project on the ground. As the TSJDF subproject did not cover all the objectives or
components initially envisaged in the PAD, and following the applicable Bank rules on
restructuring, the Bank Project Team prepared a Level 1 restructuring proposal7. That
proposal would have changed the PDO to narrow it down to the particular objectives of
the TSJDF Subproject. The restructuring would have also included: (i) revisions to the
components, subcomponents and activities included in the Project description to leave
only the ones included in the TSJDF Subproject; (ii) changes in component-specific
costs; (iii) changes in the description of disbursement categories; and (iv) changes to the
broad indicators of the results framework to reflect the expected contribution of the
TSJDF Subproject to the achievement of the revised PDO.

33.     The restructuring package was prepared well in advance but it took longer
than expected to finalize negotiations on the Loan Agreement between the Bank and
BANOBRAS. It should be noted that restructurings are not unilateral decisions taken by
the Bank but require the advice and consent of the various signatories of the legal
agreements. Nevertheless, on September 2011, the Bank decided not to pursue the
restructuring because it was by then less than six months before the Closing Date, among
other reasons because the formalization of the amendment would involve a sub-national
level government within a federal system, requiring additional consultation not only with
the signatories of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements (Federal Government,
BANOBRAS and the Bank) but also with the signatories of the sub-loan agreement
(Federal Government, BANOBRAS, the Federal District and the TSJDF) (See Annex 10).

34.     Even though this restructuring was not processed, the Project still achieved
the results expected under the TSJDF Subproject. A significant portion of the
components and activities included in the broad “menu? of the Project description were
carried out such as: (a) strengthening selected courts of the TSJDF and promote cultural
change around a new court management model, while increasing knowledge sharing
among the TSJDF and civil society around a revamped statistical system; (b) develop
more efficient and effective judicial services in the target courts by implementing the new
management model; (c) increasing judicial transparency through the TSJDF portal and
the information generated through the integrated ICT system; and (d) enhancing access to
justice for the poor and disadvantaged populations in the areas served by the targeted
courts.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization


7
  Level One restructuring applies to modifications in a project’s Development Objectives (DOs) or changes
in the safeguard category—from a lesser category set in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) to a
Category A, or trigger of a new safeguard policy. Level one restructurings are submitted to the Board of
Executive Directors for approval under absence of objection (AOB) procedures.




                                                   12
M&E Design

35.      The ICR considers the M&E design unsatisfactory. The Project Design
Summary (Annex 1 of the PAD) was supposed to guide the monitoring and evaluation of
the Project. However, it did not contain either baseline or clear target values for the
performance indicators. Also, the indicators were difficult to measure and were not
particularly connected with potential Project outputs or activities. The targets were not
defined in a way that the intended strategic impact of the Project could be appropriately
tracked. More than indicators, the results framework contained principles that the States
should follow in the design of their own Judicial Modernization Plans as the TSJDF did
in its results framework.

M&E Implementation and Utilization.

36.      Based on the general principles provided by the results framework of the
PAD, the TSJDF Subproject developed its own robust set of input, output and
impact indicators. While guidance provided by the original Project’s results framework
was limited, the TSJDF Subproject developed its own set of input/output and outcome
indicators that were effectively tracked during implementation. The TSJDF Subproject
also made a significant contribution to the improvement of the monitoring and evaluation
capacities in the TSJDF through the establishment of a specific coordination and
implementation unit, provided with full-time staff in charge of monitoring and evaluation
responsibilities, and coordination with the various units of the TSJDF engaged in the
implementation of the subproject. The single ICT network that allowed the integration of
statistical data generated by all the TSJDF courts, and the Paris 21 program that helped
improve the statistical analysis and reporting capacity of the Central Statistics Unit of the
TSJDF. This Coordination and Implementation Unit also complied with BANOBRAS’
Operational Manual to ensure monitoring and evaluation activities met the standards
required by the Subproject Agreement.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

37.     The Project was rated as Category C and did not trigger any Bank safeguard
policies. The TSJDF Subproject did not include any activities on improved access of
indigenous peoples to judicial services that had been originally envisaged in the PAD as
there are no indigenous communities in the territory served by the courts targeted by the
TSJDF Subproject. This is a large metropolitan area, highly urbanized since the colonial
times, where the indigenous communities have largely disappeared. For this reason, in
the implementation phase, the project had to focus only on the poor and disadvantaged
communities served by the targeted courts.

38.     BANOBRAS and the TSJDF were endowed with adequate management
systems, and proficient staff. There were no reported safeguard or fiduciary compliance
issues, and no systemic issues with regard to quality and reliability of Project
administration. Agreed procurement schedules were closely complied with by the TSJDF



                                             13
with the effective assistance of BANOBRAS and Bank procurement specialists
(particularly between 2009 and 2010). The ex-post reviews found that the TSJDF had
taken appropriate measures to strengthen procurement capacity and the rating was
satisfactory. Regarding financial management (FM), the annual audited financial reports
arrived on time to the Bank, presented an unqualified opinion and were reviewed and
found acceptable. Also, as part of the supervision it was considered that appropriate
Financial Management arrangements had been in place during the life of the Project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.     Judicial Modernization continues to be a high priority for the TSJDF. A
Bank Judicial Sector Rapid Assessment and Action Plan (RAAP), currently under
preparation, will look into the potential efficiency and effectiveness gains and
performance improvements for the TSJDF courts involved in the provision of civil and
commercial justice services with an aim to help improve the country ranking under the
“Doing Business? contract enforcement indicator. This RAAP will focus on the synergies
that may arise from effective institutional arrangements for service delivery, proactive
public-private partnerships, and the efficient allocation of resources. The TSJDF has also
started an innovative initiative to track progress under international standards, the first
effort of its kind in the country and the region that have been already published and is
accessible on-line. The Bank may support a TSJDF proposal to the World Bank Nordic
Trust Fund to support validation and dissemination of fair trial/due process indicators.

40.     Some indirect benefits in terms of continuity of service delivery have also
materialized. Before the Project, the target courts of the TSJDF had permanent blackouts
that often forced them to suspend services to the public for 15 to 20 hours per month
(more than two working days) due to power outages. The instability of the electrical
power system affecting the operation of the courts and their services to the user was a
major barrier to access. The integrated ICT network has resulted in reduced operating
costs and increased service life of computerized equipment, but the primary benefit has
been uninterrupted service to the public.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

41.     The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy of the World Bank Group in
partnership with the United Mexican States highlighted the importance of assistance
to the judicial system, which provided inefficient and inadequate services. In the CAS
discussion by the Executive Directors in April 2004, it was agreed that the institutional
reform agenda, as outlined by Mexico’s 2001-2006 National Development Plan, was
fundamental to improve basic services, especially for the poor. Furthermore, the National
Development Plan assigned a high priority for improving the justice sector. The CPS of




                                            14
2008 8 as well as the CPS Progress Report for the period of FY08-109 acknowledges the
project’s contribution to the Bank’s broad based institutional strengthening approach.
Thus, the objective of the Bank’s partnership with the state judiciaries to undertake a
progressive judicial modernization process to strengthen the state courts and make their
operations more transparent was entirely aligned with the national plan. The 2008 CPS
noted that strengthening institutions remains one of the key country development goals
that the Bank will continue to support through this Project in order to improve
transparency perceptions (Mexico ranked 70" out of 163 in Transparency International
index) and level of corruption (3.3 out of 10 also under Transparency International). State
judiciaries were considered critical to achieve this goal by improving the overall
functioning of, and perceptions about, public sector.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

42.     The achievement of the PDO was moderately unsatisfactory because it was
broader than the objective of the TSJDF Subproject that was actually implemented.
The Project improved the capacity and performance of the TSJDF in four areas of the
original PDO: (a) strengthening institutional capability for continuous service delivery in
four (4) critical court locations through the integrated ICT network; (b) improving
efficiency and effectiveness of judicial services through the new court management
model supported by that ICT network; (c) enhanced judicial transparency by
disseminating reliable information about the operations and performance of the four
target courts; and (d) increasing access to justice for the disadvantaged groups living in
the areas served by the same four (4) court locations. However, once it was determined
that there would be no other takers of BANOBRAS credit line for State Judicial
Modernization, the disconnect between the PDO and the TSJDF objective should have
been corrected by a Level 1 restructuring.

43.      By contrast, the achievement of the TSJDF Subproject’s development
objective was highly satisfactory. The objective of the TSJDF subproject was: (a) to
strengthen the capability of the TSJDF to provide continuous service delivery in four (4)
critical court locations; (b) improve its efficiency and effectiveness through a new court
management model supported by an ICT network. The key performance indicators were:
(a) User service applications uploaded to the institutional ICT network that serves as
backbone of the management model increase user confidence and stakeholder
satisfaction; and (b) new ICT network provides timely information on demand and supply
of justice services in the courts targeted by the Project. Training and knowledge-sharing
were provided to support the implementation of the new management model. Under the

                                            15
subproject, a new management model was pursued. Specifically, the key modernization
activity financed was an integrated ICT solution to support the TSJDF's new information
model for decision-making which is now operational in 69 courts in the four locations
selected for the subproject (Reclusorio Norte, Reclusorio Sur, Reclusorio Oriente, and
Santa Marta Acatitla) in low income areas. In parallel, the TSJDF, with its own resources
developed and updated the court services that would be operating through this ICT
network, thereby effecting a major qualitative leap in TSJDF’s new management model
based on reliable information. This new management model that provides information
for decision-making regarding financial, material and human resources optimization. It
provides information that is currently used to prepare and implement a results-based
budget with previously defined indicators. The system has also provided tools to the
judicial authorities to prevent and support the budget before the GDF Secretariat of
Finance and the State Legislative Assembly of the Federal District. The system has also
optimized communications among the various criminal trial courts and between them and
the administrative offices.

44.     The ICT platform financed by the project in all target trial courts provides
essential tools to improve service delivery. TSJDF internal communications are
increasingly paperless due to the ICT platform. These courts also have improved
communications with the Prosecutors office (Procuraduria General) and files are
accessible to court on-line. Once the TSJDF gets the case identification, the information
existing on the case can be imported to criminal courts. The new applications have
allowed the preparation of monthly statistic reports that permit better monitoring of case
processing times by judicial authorities. Average processing times in target trial courts
have been reduced to 2.3 months (71 days at trial courts). TSJDF target courts clearance
rate is 108.6% of a total criminal workload of 20,589 cases (end 2011). Criminal trial
courts have the best clearance rate at the TSJDF. The infrastructure and equipment
funded by the Plan in the target courts is ready to operate the new management model for
the oral trial system with specialized technological tools (judicial management,
courtrooms).

45.     Public information available has increased substantially. 620,896 judicial
decisions (including final judgments) have been filed in SICOR and are available for a
fee to the TSJDF staff. Access to these decisions by the public will be available by June
2012. Since 2010, annual statistics reports have been published and disseminated.
Annual reports are also available on line. The statistics portal in the TSJDF web page has
53 data banks available to the public on line on various subject matters. There is an on-
line judicial bulletin that provides the status and location of cases in courts. In the four
target criminal judicial centers, and in the buildings of Niños Heroes, Plaza Juarez, Rio
de la Plata and Sullivan, there are 22 kiosks available to the public for such case status
consultations.

46.     The first survey on TSJDF user’s satisfaction was carried out by an
independent survey firm. More than half of respondents (55.25 %) were satisfied with
TSJDF services. The level of satisfaction with the image, attention and functioning of the
target criminal courts (Reclusorios Norte, Oriente, Sur and Santa Marta Acatitla) was



                                            16
63%. Regarding the level of courts compliance with international standards of due
process under human rights treaties , 61% of those interviewed ranked the criminal courts
(6.2) in a range where 0 is the worst and 10 the best. The level of satisfaction with the
institutional actors involved in the process increases depend on the family’s monthly
income of the users. Users’ satisfaction reported by this survey is higher than the trust in
the justice system reported for the whole country by Americas Barometer, LAPOP, in
2010. Mexico scored 35.5%. 10

3.3 Efficiency

47.     Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, Financial Rate of Return, and
Cost Effective Analysis criteria were not applied to this Project. The PAD estimated
the fiscal impact of project to be about US$37 million over five years (about US$5
million total per state or about 1.0 million per state/year), which ended up not
materializing because there was only one taker of BANOBRAS credit line. A cost-benefit
analysis was conducted in 2008 to meet the Federal Government requirements for the
GDF to enter into a sub-loan agreement with BANOBRAS under a credit program
financed by external debt. The cost-benefit analysis was approved by SCHP in May 2008
and served as the basis for the design of the TSJDF subproject documentation, including
the specific monitoring indicators tracked during supervision and verified during the
preparation of this ICR. Consequently, sub-project design allowed a close monitoring of
the connection between inputs-outputs–outcomes via the use of the performance
indicators selected in the TSJDF Judicial Modernization Plan. In particular, BANOBRAS
and the TSJDF periodically reported, to the Bank’s satisfaction, on the progress towards
the achievement of these indicators.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

48.     For the reasons explained above, this ICR considers the overall Project
outcome rating to be moderately unsatisfactory, in spite of the TSJDF Subproject’s
outcome being highly satisfactory. The details on the achievement of the Project’s
objectives and results indicators as demonstrated by the TSJDF Subproject are discussed
in the data sheet and Annex 2.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) The judicial statistical information System for decision- making purposes
    largely exceeded expectations.

49.     The ICT platform established by the Project allowed the collection of
statistical information beyond the target 69 courts. Currently, statistical information
is collected from all of the 278 TSJDF courts of all subject matters, 17 justice support
offices and 13 administrative offices. Moreover, socio-economic information is also
collected by TSJDF for the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). The
ICT platform has also allowed the implementation of a pre-trial detention system capable
to generating red flags or alarms for enhanced monitoring of the defendants rights and to
better controlling compliance with due process standards.

50.      The increased demand for statistical information has prompted the TSJDF to
finance several studies with its own resources to expand links between the Judiciary
and civil society. With limited technical support from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, TSJDF has developed the indicators and conducted an
initial pilot. Also with FLACSO, the TSJDF carried out a case study to evaluate the
application of human rights international standards on TSJDF final decisions. With a
local survey firm, EPADEC, the TSJDF performed a user satisfaction survey, an activity
that the TSJDF expects to carry out every five years. Finally with the Juridical Research
Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the TSJDF has started an
assessment to study a group of cases to measure judicial error. These serious studies
have started a new trend of involving civil society organizations in assisting the TSJDF to
measure its own performance.

(b) Benefits to vulnerable groups

51.    While the TSJDF did not have specific activities for vulnerable groups’
access to justice, it adapted infrastructure to users’ needs. The TSJDF subproject
included information and orientation centers at the four targeted judicial buildings
(Reclusorios Norte, Oriente, Sur and Santa Marta Acatitla) located in the vicinity of
vulnerable group areas. 302, 220 annual users of the four targeted courts represent 15%
of the estimated 2,168,062 total TSJDF users. But of actual users, 58.8% are persons
whose family income is less than US$450 per month, 30.8% are also users whose
families make between US$450 and US$1000 per month. 39.8 % of all users are women.

(c) Transparency Improvements:

52.     Project achievements in the areas of transparency/accountability were also
substantial. The TSJDF web site has a Transparency Portal that permits public
consultation of the asset declarations of TSJDF staff and also of the TSJDF transparency
indicators. The web site also allows reviewing of the status of human rights due process
indicators. The Annual Statistics Report has a section on the number of complaints
received by year on violations of the human right to a fair trial. The Annual Report also



                                            18
includes the number of judges that have been sanctioned (9 judges in 2010).The ICT
platform has also allowed the TSJDF to comply with the new Transparency Law and it is
able to provide answers to information requests that do not affect privacy rights in less
than 7 days.

53.    The installation of a security system that monitors the operations of the 69
target courts improved safety and transparency. The security system, with 190 video
cameras that monitor the activities inside and outside of the 69 target criminal courts plus
improvements in power and lighting systems, has improved safety for staff, users, data
and property. This system is able to archive the images collected for a period of 30 days
and has served to prevent cases of fraud or corruption, the loss of records and property,
while it has ensured the safety of employees and users of the courts and ensured
compliance with due process standards. 11 A mainstream centralized server has increased
information security and minimized the opportunities for the tampering of information.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

54.     The TSJDF Subproject substantially strengthened critical elements of the
TSJDF’s internal planning, monitoring and evaluation functions that had been
previously weak or non-existent. It radically changed justice services delivery in one of
the largest urban centers in the world through an information system for target trial courts
that proved to be very effective in terms of increases in the clearance rates, shortened
case time resolution, and coordinated policy-making by the highest authorities.

55.     Moreover, the TSJDF Subproject made a significant contribution towards
improving the overall performance and institutional capacity of the TSJDF. The
Subproject piloted an information system in the criminal courts of four (4) locations,
which was extended to other subject matters (civil, labor, family) with the TSJDF’s own
financial resources. The single ICT platform contributes to enhanced accountability and
transparency, especially when helping to disseminate planning/monitoring information
for evaluating court performance generated by the Statistical Unit established and
operational with support of Bank complementary non-lending technical assistance.

  After the public debate provoked by the film ‘Presunto Culpable’, the TSJDF has

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Low

56.     It is unlikely that any changes occur in the near future which could be
detrimental to the ultimate achievement of the TSJDF’s Subproject development
outcome. The TSJDF Subproject received the full-fledged support of the Chief Justice
(recently re-elected for an additional 4-year period) even though it had been designed
under a previous administration. The Chief Justice has retained the specialist on
multilateral-financed project design and implementation as part of his regular staff and
has indicated his interest in continuing receiving Bank assistance through a proposed
RAAP. The commitment of the TSJDF Management and Staff during the last two years
of implementation of the Subproject provides reasonable assurances of sustainability in
the years to come. Main subproject outcomes (court management model, integrated ICT
network, statistical unit) have been sustained after Project closing. Operation and
maintenance of the ICT platform has been financed by the TSJDF resources since the
inception (the BANOBRAS credit program only financed the initial investments, not
operating recurrent costs). The TSJDF authorities have confirmed their interest in
continuing with the complementary non-lending technical assistance for the statistical
unit and have requested additional support to enhance fair trial standards in accordance
with international best practice.

57.     Even though no Bank-financed follow up operation will take place, the
stability of the TSJDF leadership and management provides good grounds for the
sustainability and mainstreaming of the reforms the Subproject supported. As
judicial modernization has been incorporated into the Chief Justice’s reform agenda, it is
expected that the TSJDF will provide appropriate resources to continue the reform path
initiated by the Subproject. The continuation of the Paris 21 statistical program and the
carrying out of a RAAP in partnership with the Bank’s Financial and Private Sector
Development Practice and particularly the “Doing Business? team signals the
commitment of the TSJDF for a continued relationship with the Bank around an
ambitious reform agenda.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Unsatisfactory

58.     The proactivity of the Bank team during the identification, preparation, and
appraisal stages was insufficient to ensure participation of State Governments or to
create demand for the BANOBRAS judicial modernization credit program. The
identification process focused on critical gaps and the need for new approaches to
Mexico’s state justice sector. The Project’s design process ensured that it was consistent



                                           20
with the needs and priorities of the State Judiciaries identified by the main local
stakeholders, as condensed in the 16 State Judicial Modernization Plans developed during
Project preparation. During appraisal, the Bank failed to take into account all major
relevant technical and institutional aspects. The Bank consistently maintained a superb
working relationship with the State Judiciaries during the identification-to–appraisal
period although that was not enough to ensure the commitment of the State Governments
or prompt Loan effectiveness. The five (5) letters of intent signed by State authorities
during preparation neither materialized in applications for the BANOBRAS credit line by
the State Secretaries of Finance nor was the Bank able to roll out an innovative financial
product within in the time required to retain the interest of potential applicants to the
credit line.

59.     While the design was flexible enough to adapt to the varied needs and
priorities of the States, there were some issues with the readiness for
implementation as well as the monitoring and evaluation arrangements.
Consequently, the ICR finds that the Bank did not properly identify and assess the
Project’s risks related to the rolling-out of its new financial product, did not achieve the
actual engagement of State Executive Branches, did not anticipate the subnationals
reaction to the high costs of borrowing from the Bank-BANOBRAS credit program and
the Federal Government policy restrictions applicable to the use of external debt by the
GDF, and therefore failed to put in place appropriate mitigation measures for these risks.
The fact that the only actual applicant (the GDF-TSJDF) had not signed any letter of
intent suggests that while the team had been somewhat successful in attracting the initial
general interest of a number of sub-nationals, it was unable to convert such interest into
firm commitments to join the BANOBRAS program.

60.     Neither of the benefits expected to be derived from successful Project
implementation were clearly spelled out in a clearly articulated results framework.
The Judicial modernization Plans developed their own frameworks through intensive
participation and consultation with local stakeholders but received little guidance in the
task from the broad indicators in the PAD. The logical framework developed for the
TSJDF Subproject followed closely the outline of such principles two for the PDO and
one per each component but had to identify baselines and numeric targets that were not
even suggested by the PAD.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including fiduciary and safeguards policies)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     Supervision activities exceeded typical Bank standards. In addition to at least
two field trips a year, periodic video and audio conferences were held to closely monitor
the progress of the TSJDF Subproject activities and to discuss implementation issues. A
Public Sector Specialist operating from the Mexico DF country office served as
permanent liaison with counterparts in BANOBRAS and the TSJDF. The Project had




                                            21
only two Task Team Leaders during supervision, and was supported by a qualified team
of local and international consultants, some of them based in Mexico.

62.     The task team was complimented on several occasions for being extremely
proactive in turning around a problem project. Particularly after the 2008
restructuring, the team was complimented for helping BANOBRAS and the TSJDF to
prioritize activities and speed up implementation while helping to explore alternative
approaches such as a single “turn-key? contract. The revision of the annual operations
plan (AOP) after the restructuring helped to make the sequencing of Project activities
more relevant to the achievement of the PDO. Supervision improved under and new Bank
team leader and the Management comments to the June 2009 ISR specifically
congratulated the team for bringing this Project out of actual problem project (APP)
status. Particularly creative was the design of a complementary technical assistance
package to address the client concerns about the extra financial cost of the Bank-
supported credit line that had been a major obstacle in the entering of a sub-loan
agreement by all interested sub-nationals.

63.     However, failure to finalize the proposed restructuring at an earlier stage
represents a major shortcoming of overall supervision. After it was determined that
only the TSJDF Subproject would be financed by the Loan, the Bank had the duty to
report back to the Board that the very ambitious PDO was not achievable as originally
envisioned because the only taker of BANOBRAS credit line had selected a narrower set
of objectives and activities, as it was entitled to do under Project design. Such
restructuring would have ensured that the PDO and Project description would be fully
consistent with what was happening on the ground during 2010-2011 as opposed to what
was expected in 2004. Failure to finalize that restructuring earlier impaired the quality of
supervision. By June 2011, six months before the Closing Date the restructuring would
not have added significant value as the changes to the PDO and the indicators to reflect
the reduced Project scope would have only applied to the remaining balance of the
subloan (approximately US$ 4 million). A restructuring at that late stage would have not
made a substantial difference in the assessment of Project PDO and implementation
progress (IP) in the last ISR and on ICR ratings, as there was little time to show results
under the reduced Project scope. It was also believed that the ICR would be the right
place to report on the achievements of the TSJDF subproject.12




12
   In 2009 the Bank and BANOBRAS had agreed to proceed with the cancellation of US$ 16.6 million
before the restructuring because that action would avoid BANOBRAS incurring commitment fees on the
cancelled balance and followed a streamlined process that only required unilateral action by the Borrower
while the restructuring required revising the language of most of the Loan Agreement. The expectation that
the restructuring would happen shortly thereafter did not take into account the complexity of such revisions.
In retrospect, as by that time it was already clear that the Project scope had to be narrowed down it would
have been more effective to process a single restructuring (including the cancellation) instead of splitting it
from the restructuring, so as to benefit from the high priority assigned by the Borrower to the cancellation.




                                                     22
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

64.     Overall the Bank performance is rated as moderately unsatisfactory. Based
on the above discussion, the ICR finds that while the Bank had major shortcomings at
entry it effectively facilitated Project implementation by overcoming serious start up
delays, removing critical unexpected bottlenecks, and engaging a critical sub-national
client that was able to achieve in full the objectives of its own State Judicial
Modernization Plan. However, failure to process a restructuring to reflect the fact that the
single taker of BANOBRAS credit line had selected only a few of the “menu? of
objectives/activities initially envisioned under the Project justifies a downgrading in
overall Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

65.      While the GoM and BANOBRAS reiterated their commitment to the Project
at various points during Project implementation, failure to detect original design
issues and to finalize the restructuring affected overall performance. The Project was
included as a key Bank assistance instruments in the 2007 CAS and the 2010 CAS
Progress Report. Furthermore, the GoM’s commitment to achieving the Project’s
objectives remained consistent throughout Project implementation, in particular between
2007-2009 when President Calderon publicly ratified his Government support to this
initiative and SHCP took over a very active role in finding a solution to the bottleneck
that had delayed the signing of the sub-loan agreement between BANOBRAS and the
GDF. However, significant design issues that could have been detected earlier posed
serious challenges to project start-up, and failure to finalize the proposed level 1
restructuring at an earlier stage, which affected the Bank’s performance, also impacted
BANOBRAS as both partners were responsible for supporting effective project
supervision.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

66.     The overall performance of BANOBRAS as implementing agency was
satisfactory. A senior management team in the Technical Assistance and Multilateral
Projects Unit took responsibility for Project implementation, in close coordination with
other functional and territorial units of BANOBRAS that cooperated closely with the
Bank team. On regular basis, the BANOBRAS team verified compliance with the Project
Operational Manual and Procurement Plan, and tracked the agreed indicators. Thanks to
the close working relationship between BANOBRAS and the TSJDF performance



                                            23
picked-up dramatically in the last two years of Project implementation. Generally, the
BANOBRAS team: (i) quickly responded to the demands for assistance from the TSJDF
in carrying out various project components; (ii) provided an effective liaison with the
Bank and the TSJDF.

67.     Fiduciary aspects were effectively handled by BANOBRAS. The financial
management system (including accounting, controls, auditing and reporting) was
adequate and satisfied the Bank’s financial management requirements. The TSJDF
followed the procurement and financial management rules and procedures established for
BANOBRAS credit lines, kept accurate records and accounts, and generated timely
financial information. Procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the
Project followed the Bank Procurement Guidelines. The delays of the first years of
Project implementation were partially offset by the rapid implementation of the “turn-key?
contract that packaged all goods, works and services between January and December
2010 with the assistance of the Bank’s procurement specialist.

68.     BANOBRAS effectively coordinated implementation of technical and
administrative aspects between the TSJDF and the Bank. The financial management
system provided by BANOBRAS (including disbursements, accounting, controls,
auditing and reporting) was adequate and satisfied the Bank’s requirements.
BANOBRAS submitted quarterly and annual reports in a timely manner, based on the
Project’s monitoring and evaluation system. These reports provided valuable information
on how the Project was progressing with disaggregated data. BANOBRAS also supported
the TSJDF in the preparation of the complex procurement documents required for an
innovative “turn-key? contract that included the technical specifications for the civil
works and the ICT equipment, as well as separate TORs for the supervision of the civil
works.

69.     BANOBRAS ensured that the participatory process followed during Project
preparation reached an unusual number of stakeholders. In order to generate
momentum for change, efforts were made by BANOBRAS to involve as many
stakeholders as possible in discussing policy options available and in the overall decision-
making process that led to 16 State Judicial Modernization Plans. This represents a record
in the number of participatory exercises attended by hundreds of local stakeholders, not
only for the Judiciaries but from bar associations, academic institutions and civil society
organizations.

70.     BANOBRAS, GDF and the TSJDF worked closely with the Bank’s team on a
regular basis, and cooperated fully in addressing any issues detected during
preparation or implementation of the relevant Subproject. Appropriate levels of
review and approval were in place; financial accountability was observed; expenditures
were duly authorized; and documentation was properly maintained for periodic review.
The Project did not suffer from any counterpart funding problems as the GDF made
appropriate budget provisions for the TSJDF. Thanks to close cooperation between
BANOBRAS and the TSJDF Loan Covenants were fully complied with (including the
financial covenants related to audits), with no delays. Audit reports were satisfactory, and



                                            24
financial and procurement ex-post reviews were also acceptable. At the appropriate time,
BANOBRAS requested and processed the cancellation of the unused balance for
approximately USD 16.5 million equivalent.

71.     The overall performance of the TSJDF was satisfactory. TSJDF provided
overall policy guidance through the Chief Justice working in conjunction with members
of the Judicial Council. The Chief Justice entrusted his Oficial Mayor (General Manager)
the overall responsibility for Project implementation. TSJDF’s administrative structure is
designed along functional lines; for Project purposes the functional responsibilities were
assigned to the Directors of three technical units (Informatics, Infrastructure and
Statistics) that cooperated regularly with BANOBRAS and the Bank. This group was
responsible for the overall implementation of the Project, on the basis of the AOPs
approved by BANOBRAS and the Bank.

72.     The performance of the technical units of TSJDF was also satisfactory. The
Informatics and Infrastructure Directorates were responsible for the detailed technical
design of the activities envisaged under the TSJDF Subproject. Their Directors reported
directly to the Chief Justice and the Oficial Mayor. Minor staff turnover took place
during Project implementation. Generally, the three Directorates: (i) responded to the
demands for assistance from the field units of the TSJDF in carrying out various
Subproject components in four different locations; (ii) ensured an effective liaison with
the decision-making levels of the TSJDF and promoted the adequate utilization of
TSJDF’s installed institutional capacity; and (iii) ensured compliance with the Bank’s
requirements in the areas of procurement, disbursement and financial management.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

73.    Overall Borrower performance was considered moderately satisfactory
 despite a moderately unsatisfactory rating. BANOBRAS and the Bank could have
 been more proactive in finalizing the proposed restructuring at the appropriate time.
 However, the satisfactory performance of both BANOBRAS and the TSJDF in the
 implementation of the only sub-project financed by the credit line largely offsets this
 shortcoming of project supervision.

   6. Lessons Learned

Lessons of Generic Application

74.     Institutional reform Projects in upper-middle income countries may be
implemented directly by line agencies, sometimes with the support of other agencies
experienced in Bank procedures. In the justice sector where there is limited experience
in the management of international cooperation, specialized Project Coordination Units
(PCUs) staffed by experts with strong technical and professional qualifications have been
the standard implementing arrangement. PCUs are supposed to provide continuity and



                                           25
credibility during implementation. However, for the TSJDF Subproject, one of the most
critical decisions taken early at the design stage was not to establish a PCU, but rather to
delegate implementation responsibilities to three line Directorates, under the direct
supervision of the Official Mayor who hired an external consultant with experience on
international cooperation projects to work with him to handle day-to-day implementation.
The TSJDF Subproject success was closely related to the stability, continuity and
capabilities of these line units that reported to the Chief Justice through the Oficial Mayor.

75.     Access components in public sector projects may provide an appropriate
interface between State institutions and vulnerable groups. While focusing on
internal strengthening, institutional reforms should also pay attention to demands of users
or potential users, in particular from vulnerable groups. The TSJDF subproject did not
include particular activities to bring services to poor urban users of justice services;
nevertheless, four court locations were strategically selected in the proximity to low-
income neighborhoods and this selection produced positive results in terms of enhanced
access. Attention to this aspect is vital to achieve the Bank’s mandate to reduce poverty
and strengthen democratic governance; strategic choices at the design stage may result in
projects dealing both with public sector management and social development issues that
require a multi-disciplinary approach and possibly a cross-sector approach.

Project Specific Lessons

76.     To measure Project success or failure, indicators are critical and should be
chosen carefully and in the early stages of the project cycle. Several criteria were used
in the selection of the seven indicators for the TSJDF Subproject: linkage with the
objective being tracked; likely availability of data; likelihood of measurable change
within the Subproject lifetime; and ease of interpretation. It was anticipated that
indicators that met these criteria could be effectively followed up and they were
effectively tracked. By contrast, the very general and undefined indicators of the PAD
logical framework were not very useful for the design of the particular indicators of the
TSJDF subproject, beyond providing broad principles as guidance. The attribution of
outcomes to outputs was difficult or impossible, or results could only be identifiable at
the input level. Definition of baseline data must occur at the beginning of the Project or
shortly thereafter. Most baseline data and means of tracking performance and the TSJDF
Subproject achievements did exist when the Subproject went into effect. This was critical
for establishing performance targets, focusing the executing agency on achieving them,
establishing the monitoring and evaluation system, and allowing the Project to show
progress. To face the constraints of the Federal Government guidelines on eligibility of
expenditures for public credit contracted by the GDF, the Bank correctly attached a
technical assistance package to the subproject that provided the consultants services
required not only to develop the Project’s M&E system but also a statistical system for
the whole TSJDF.

77.    Working at a subnational level poses additional challenges in a complex
sector. The TSJDF and other Mexican sub-nationals were affected by a broad and
complex set of internal and external variables, which could not be fully anticipated at the



                                             26
subproject design stage. While the subproject was highly explicit in its goals and
strategies, it also had flexibility to accommodate unforeseen situations, for example to
adapt Project activities to new opportunities to advance deeper reforms such as the entry
into effect of the new Code of Criminal Procedures, which was a priority for the new
TSJDF and which also received Bank support through the complementary technical
assistance package. However, the complexity of working with subnationals was
illustrated by the protracted and aborted restructuring process.

78.     Major cancellations and/or reallocations impacting the PDO and results
framework must be accompanied by comprehensive restructurings. The completion
of the processing of a restructuring close to 2 years after a major cancellation/reallocation
took place reveals a critical shortcoming during supervision. It distorted the “rules of the
game? for the Bank and Borrower implementation teams as after the
cancellation/reallocation they started to operate on the ground under the assumption of a
reduced Project scope, in the expectation that the restructuring would be completed
shortly thereafter, and made good progress under that assumption. Unfortunately, the
restructuring was never completed thereby generating a disconnect vis-à-vis the original
PDO and results framework. More proactive Management decisions should have been
taken early in the process to either complete the restructuring shortly after the
cancellation or not proceed with the cancellation until the restructuring affecting the PDO
and results framework took place and was duly reflected in the legal agreements.

Justice sector reform specific

79.     A realistic assessment of justice sector issues at the early stages of the
preparation process is essential as a basis for quality project design. Project design
should be based on a solid institutional assessment process that engages a range of justice
sector stakeholders, not only justice operators. Moreover, justice projects need to
recognize a number of critical, exogenous variables in their risk-management model. In
this Project, although 16 State Judicial Modernization Plans had been prepared in close
consultation with justice operators and users, the effort did not lead to an ability to
manage risks and overcome implementation obstacles arising from lack of commitment
of the State Executives, the complexity of the interfaces between the Federal and State
Governments, or the lack of credit capacity of some of the original 16 states. Justice
Projects should avoid raising stakeholder expectations, and acknowledge policy
constraints upfront. Reform leaders should be aware of the risk of setting standards too
high and of creating unrealistic expectations about what can be delivered. Projects with
relatively modest scope such as the TSJDF Subproject are able to achieve a few deeper
changes, on a smaller scale. The fact that the only taker of the credit line selected only a
small portion of the “menu? of objectives and activities included in the description of the
Project suggests that the original design was overly optimistic about the ability to engage
a large number of State judiciaries with multi-faceted needs.

80.     Justice projects should be structured around a problem-solving strategy and
should engage all actors required to implement a proposed solution. Demands for
assistance to this complex sector should be analyzed under a problem-solving framework



                                             27
that looks at the functions to be improved and the services to be delivered. Components
and activities should be articulated around service delivery improvements. i.e. practical
solutions to particular problems. While the PAD for this Project did not clearly follow
this approach, its embedded flexibility allowed the TSJDF subproject to be developed
with the appropriate geographic and thematic targeting (only four locations, only 69
criminal courts). Even in a geographically limited sub-national jurisdiction, it was not
possible to cover the full territory of GDF with a single USD13.5 million sub-loan or to
address various thematic areas (civil, commercial, labor, family, administrative) at the
same time; decisions on geographical or thematic areas had to be driven by a factual
analysis of service demand. As a consequence, the TSJDF Subproject only sought to
ensure that citizens in a particular geographical area received a certain type of service, as
in the case of the low-income Colonias and Delegaciones in the marginal areas served by
the selected courts.

Judicial Branch Specific

81.     Civil society’s participation is critical at all stages of design and
implementation of justice projects. Through the advocacy role of civil society
organizations, citizens are given a voice in the process of formulating public policies in
relevant areas of institutional reform. To strengthen these constituencies, justice projects
need to work with bar associations, academic institutions and other organizations that are
at the forefront of reform efforts, or that can take advantage of reform opportunities. As
recorded in the PAD, broad inclusion of civil society in this Project was the right choice.
Coalition-building included allies from both inside and outside the State Judicial
Branches, and allies such as CONATRIB, judges, advocacy groups, business associations,
and the media. During implementation, the involvement of these organizations was
maintained through periodic feedback mechanisms.

82.      Support to infrastructure refurbishment should be considered when it is
linked to changes in core management processes and functions. While justice
institutions may need modern buildings, equipment and ICT technology, the essence of
justice sector reform is institutional change. It demands changes in the court’s
administrative and managerial culture, replacement of obsolete procedures, and
reengineering of internal processes. The TSJDF Subproject linked substantive elements
of institutional reform to limited infrastructure construction/remodeling with a clear and
limited geographical focus. Subproject design also ensured that the investments in
infrastructure and equipment did not divert attention from re-engineering the internal
process. The absence of suitable facilities for court operation was identified at the design
stage as a major obstacle to the TSJDF’s chances of providing adequate services, in
particular for vulnerable communities. Dilapidated facilities made it unlikely that
organizational changes, internal communication improvements, and the ICT system’s
upgrading would generate the expected service improvements. Financing
rehabilitation/refurbishment of courts buildings was justified to the extent that
infrastructure changes were closely aligned with new work processes designed to
increase operational effectiveness, for example, the adoption of new court management
models for the delivery of justice services that allowed these courts to upgrade the range



                                             28
of services they could provide. The fact that the ICT network supported successfully not
only the M&E system of the Subproject, but it contributed also the set up of a brand new
statistical system for the whole TSJDF confirms that the close connection between the
ICT investments supported and a major institutional reform.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Background

The TSJDF Subproject was part of a larger credit line in which several other Mexican
states were expected to participate. For the reasons discussed in the main body of the ICR,
the only subnational that participated in this credit line was the TSJDF. The TSJDF
Subproject financed a series of priority activities included in the TSJDF’s Judicial
Modernization Plan. The Subproject could only finance the infrastructure and equipment
necessary to implement such activities because under Mexico’s applicable DF public debt
regulations, Bank resources could only be used for those purposes, while the related
technical assistance had to be financed by the TSJDF’s own resources.

However, as a part of an agreement to offset part of the Sub-loan financial costs, the
Bank was also able to provide non-reimbursable technical assistance in two areas: (a) The
joint World Bank-OECD Rapid Data Processing (RDP) program. This program began in
early 2009 with a visit by RDP team and included subsequent visits of technical experts
to improve the TSJDF statistical capacity; and (b) Development of a strategy for the
adoption of oral-based trials. This activity began with a study tour of five (5) TSJDF
representatives to Santiago, Chile in July 2009 to analyze that country’s experience with
the implementation of an oral-based justice system and continued with a series of visits to
the TSJDF, between September 2009 and June 2010, by international experts to prepare a
TSJDF strategy for the implementation of similar procedures.

The original PAD results indicators were not appropriate to measure the impact of the
TSJDF Subproject. The PAD indicators were not direct, adequate or attributable only to
any particular Bank-financed intervention. Instead, they provided only general principles
about how those indicators could be developed in the context of a specific Judicial
Modernization Plan. For this reason, at the signing of the TSJDF Sub-loan in 2008, as
part of the operational plan a set of specific input indicators was agreed with the TSJDF.
The TSJDF reported on these input indicators throughout Project implementation. The
Bank Project Team also submitted a proposal to modify the original PAD indicators
through a level I restructuring, but this process was not completed. Therefore, this ICR
had to establish the connection between the TSJDF Subproject achievements, and the
original PAD indicators using a series of outcome/result indicators agreed with the
TSJDF as part of its Judicial Modernization Plan.

       TSJDF Subproject: Ten (10) user service applications uploaded to the institutional
       network that serves as backbone of the management model increased user confidence and
       stakeholder satisfaction in TSJDF services according to latest information available.

       Status as of May 2012: Partially Achieved

       On the basis of the only subproject financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s) and the
       surveys conducted, stakeholder satisfaction with the only participating subnational
       following modernization activities financed by the Project have increased. 5 user service
       applications uploaded to the ICT institutional platform have increased confidence and
       stakeholder satisfaction with the TSJDF according to surveys.

          According to a survey carried out by EPADEC for the TSJDF, more than half of
          respondents (55.25 %) were satisfied with TSJDF services. Women were slightly less
          positive (52.6%) than men (57.9) (see Figure No. 1). The satisfaction level did not vary
          significantly if the respondent was a plaintiff (52.4%) or a defendant (54%). The level of
          satisfaction with the image, attention and functioning of the target courts (criminal and
          juvenile) was between 63% and 64% (higher than the average for the whole TSJDF (see
          Figure No. 2).

An automated case tracking application for the new criminal procedures has been
developed and is ready for implementation in the juvenile and sentence execution courts.

Overall, the level of users’ satisfaction reported by the EPADEC survey is substantially
higher in the TSJDF than the satisfaction with the criminal justice system reported for the
whole country by Americas Barometer, LAPOP, in 2010. Mexico scored 35.5%, only
above Ecuador and Peru (See Figure No. 3).

Indicator No. 2: Improved Capacity Building and Communication Practices.

Baseline data
PAD: None

ISRs: Limited capacities in coordination, HR planning, budgets and evaluation
mechanisms. Baseline data to be inserted upon each state judiciary's formal inclusion to
the Project.

TSJDF Subproject: No ICT network provides information on demand and supply of
justice services in the target courts (Reclusorios Norte, Este and Sur, and Santa Martha
Acatitla). No training and knowledge-sharing. Inter-institutional arrangements with other
sector agencies GDF, public security secretariat Attorney General and General Counsel
for the implementation of the Criminal Procedures Code not established.

End target
PAD: None

ISRs: Provision of timely information on demand and supply of judicial services,
efficiency gains in the use of resources, availability and successful completion of training
and successful knowledge sharing.

TSJDF Subproject: New ICT platform provides timely information on demand and
supply of justice services in the target courts (Reclusorios Norte, Este and Sur, and Santa
Marta Acatitla), to ensure efficiency gains in the use of resources. Training and
knowledge-sharing provided to support the implementation of the new management
model. Inter-institutional arrangements with other sector agencies GDF, public security
secretariat Attorney General and DF General Counsel in place for the implementation of
the juvenile courts and the sentence execution courts.

Status as of May 2012: Exceeded

On the basis of the only sub-project financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s), the
communication practices of the only subnational participating in the Project have
improved as demonstrated by the intensive dissemination of information through the
TSJDF portal about the operations and performance of the target courts. The capacity-
building practices of the only subnational participating in the Project have also improved
through the training provided to the operators (including partner agencies) of the
integrated management model financed by the Project.

Monthly statistical reports on a set of indicators defined by judicial authorities to monitor
performance are distributed among TSJDF’s decision-making authorities (President,
Oficial Mayor, Judicial Council Members, Human Rights Directorate, Criminal
Detention Directorate, etc).




                                             34
The ICT platform provides timely information on demand and supply of justice services
in the target courts (Reclusorios Norte, Este and Sur, and Santa Marta Acatitla) to ensure
efficient use of resources.

The ICT platform in the target courts allows access to e-mail, intranet and extranet and
internet that have improved internal and external communication practices. TSJDF
internal communications in these courts are paperless. The courts also have also
improved communications with the Prosecutors office (Procuraduria General) and cases
can be presented to court on-line. Once the TSJDF gets the case identification number,
the relevant file can be automatically transferred to the criminal courts.

Moreover, all the socio-economic information about defendants required by INEGI is
now collected and forwarded to INEGI on line. In the second semester of 2012, the
TSJDF ICT platform will be connected to the Federal Intelligence Platform, established
to fight crime and violence.

Intermediate Outcome Indicators

Component I: Strengthening Institutional Capabilities, Culture and Knowledge

Indicator 1: Improved information development for institutional planning and
external services

ICT network covers 80% of target TSJDF staff (approximately 1,600 out of 2,000 staff).




                                           35
Status as of May 2012: Partially Achieved

On the basis of the only sub-project financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s), the
information for institutional planning and external services of the only subnational
participating in the Project has improved as demonstrated by the effective establishment
and operation of the TJSDF statistical unit, and the dissemination of statistical
information through the TSJDF portal about the operations and performance of the target
courts.

The new integrated information system for Institutional Planning and External Services is
in place. This system provides information for decision-making regarding financial,
material and human resources optimization, that is currently used to prepare and
implement results-based budgets linked with previously defined indicators. The system
has also provided tools to the judicial authorities to present and support the budget before
the Secretariat of Finance and the Legislative Assembly of the DF. The system has also
optimized communications among the various target courts and between them and the
administrative offices.

The integrated ICT platform financed by the Project is currently running four (4) key
systems or applications: 1) the Statistical Information System for Criminal Justice
(SIEMP) that compiles statistics and also records pre-trial detentions from criminal
courts; 2) the On-line system to compile statistical information (CLIE) from civil and
family courts; 3) the Integrated System for judicial resolutions consultation (SICOR) that
provides information on civil and family resolutions; and 4) the Criminal Detention
System (Sistema de Consignaciones Penales). A fifth application, the new TSJDF
criminal management system (SGPJ - Sistema de Gestión Penal Judicial) has been
developed and is being implemented in juvenile and sentence execution courts (See
Figure No. 4). 16 These systems support oral-based trials, and include a case tracking
feature that allows close criminal justice performance monitoring.




16
  Another system, currently in a testing phase, will allow citizens to make case related deposits (bails,
guarantees and the like) in a commercial bank. Such deposits will be electronically notified to TSJDF
courts using linkages to the ICT platform.




                                                     36
278 courts (including the target courts) process statistics online for the TSJDF and
INEGI. SIEMP produces criminal statistics data from 69 criminal trial courts, 40
criminal justice of the peace courts, 2 sentencing execution courts, 15 juvenile courts and
26 appellate courts. The CLIE compiles information from 83 civil courts, 27 civil
justices of the peace courts, 42 family courts, 17 justice support offices and 13
administrative offices (see Figure No.5).

100% of project target courts now have access to e-mail, intranet and extranet and
internet, antivirus, and SIEMP. The Institutional ICT network covers 100% of target
courts (69 courts, each of which has an average of 19 computers) for a total of 1324
desktops available to the whole staff of the target courts (1,656 persons).

Comment: The statistical system exceeds by far original expectations. It went beyond
criminal courts to cover all TSJDF courts, the administrative offices and the support
offices. The SIEMP has been also able to compile all the socio-economic information
requested by INEGI and has superseded manual completion of reporting forms for each
defendant (see Figure No.5).

Two areas for further improvement remain: (a) electronic signature; and (b) a single
identification number. The Information Technology Office is currently working on both.

Expansion of the statistical reporting system to other areas beyond the target courts were
carried out with the TSJDF’s own resources (see Figure No. 5).

No cultural change or knowledge sharing activities were included in the TSJDF
subproject (other than the program sponsored by the Bank and Paris 21 for the RDP
program and the plan for the implementation of the new oral-based trials).

Component 2: Improving Efficiency and Effectiveness of Judicial Services

Indicator 2.1: Reduction in case processing times

Baseline data
PAD: None

ISRs: Case processing time in courts is high. Baseline data to be inserted upon each state
judiciary's formal inclusion to the Project.

TSJDF Subproject: Average processing times in target trial courts 2.5 months. TSJDF
target courts clearance rate of 77.8 % in 2008.Total workload 18,180 cases a year in the
target courts. 0 target courts are able to carry out virtual trials and videotaped oral-based
trials. 0 target courts are able to carry out virtual trials and videotaped oral-based trials.

End Target
PAD: None

ISRs: Case processing times reduced.

TSJDF Subproject: Average processing times in target trial courts 2.0 months. Target
courts clearance rate 100%. Total workload of up to 20,000 cases a year. 35 target courts
able to carry out virtual trials and videotaped oral-based trials.

Status as of May 2012: Partially Achieved

On the basis of the only subproject financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s) the
modernization activities financed under the Project have reduced the case processing
times of the Judiciary of the only participating subnational.

The SIEMP and the Criminal Detention System have allowed the preparation of monthly
statistic reports for monitoring of case processing times by judicial authorities.

In 2010, the TSJDF ordered a case file review17 by a civil society organization to define
the processing times in all subjects. This review covered a 2009 representative sample of
all criminal, civil and family cases. According to this sample, average processing times
in target trial courts have been reduced to 2.3 months (71 days in the target courts) (see
Figure No.6).

system.

Comments

Two more sentencing execution courts will be establishing in the second semester of
2012 with the TSJDF’s own resources. The Criminal Pre-Trial Detention System and the
SIEMP have incorporated an innovative human rights red flag alert system to better
control the status of pre-trial detainees, victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse,
femicides, torture, trafficking of persons and cases where indigenous people are involved.
The system sends an immediate alert to the Human Rights Office at the TSJDF
President's Office and ensures close monitoring of these cases.


Component 3. Increasing Judicial Transparency

Indicator 3.1: Increased availability of public information

Baseline:
PAD: None

ISRs: Information available to the public in state courts is limited. Baseline data to be
inserted upon each state judiciary's formal inclusion to the Project.

TSJDF Subproject: 0 court databases operating through the integrated network and
accessible to court staff and general public. 0 judicial statistics reports compiled quarterly
for decision-making purposes, and published annually for public dissemination. 0 judicial
decisions disseminated through integrated ICT network.

End Target:
PAD: None

ISRs: Public Information available has increased.

TSJDF Subproject: 6 court databases to operate through the integrated ICT network
developed under the Subproject and accessible to court staff and general public, and 4
judicial statistics reports compiled quarterly for decision-making purposes, and published
annually for public dissemination. Up to 19,000 judicial decisions (including up to
15,000 final judgments) a year disseminated through the integrated ICT network.

Status as of May 2012: Achieved

On the basis of the only subproject financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s) the
modernization activities financed under the Project have increased availability of public
information about the Judiciary of the only participating subnational.

Five (5) court databases are operating through the integrated ICT network developed
under the Project and are accessible to court staff; one of them -SICOR- will be available
to the public for a fee in June 2012. Service charges will be between US$30 and US$60
a month depending on the number of judicial resolutions that the subscriber would like to
access. Public access to judicial resolutions on-line would imply a dramatic savings in
time for subscribers to the service in a city with serious traffic congestion. As part of the
TSJDF Subproject cost-benefit analysis required by the GoM, it was estimated that
allowing subscribers to access judicial resolutions online would imply savings of around
36.6 million pesos (approximately US$3,000,000) per year.18 As of May 2012, 620,896
judicial decisions (including final judgments) have been filed in SICOR.

Beginning in 2012, monthly judicial statistics reports have been made available for
decision-making purposes. Since 2010, annual statistics reports have been published and
disseminated. Annual reports are also available on line. An on-line judicial bulletin that
provides the status of judicial resolutions issued, and the location of cases in the courts.
In the four criminal judicial centers, and in the buildings of Niños Heroes, Plaza Juarez,
Rio de la Plata and Sullivan there are 22 kiosks available to the public for such case
status consultations.

The TSJDF web site (http://www.poderjudicialdf.gob.mx/swb/ ) has a Transparency
Portal http://www.poderjudicialdf.gob.mx/swb/PJDF/Transparencia that permits public
consultation of the asset declarations of TSJDF judges under a voluntary disclosure
program. The portal also provides information on the TSJDF transparency indicators
(http://www.poderjudicialdf.gob.mx/es/PJDF/III_Funciones.), and the status of human
rights due process indicators (http://www.poderjudicialdf.gob.mx/en/PJDF/Indicadores ).
This report records the number of complaints received about violations of the right to a
fair trial. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of complaints has increased by 26.5%,
from 640 to 871. Most complaints (45%) arise in criminal cases. 40% of the complaints
deal with procedural irregularities, 16.6% with obtaining certified copies of judicial
resolutions, 16.2% with abuse of authority by TSDFJ staff, and 11.6 % with detainees’
rights. The Annual Report also includes the number of judges that have been sanctioned
under disciplinary procedures (9 in 2010).

The ICT platform has also allowed the TSJDF to comply with the new Transparency
Law. The TSJDF is able to provide answers to information requests that do not involve
privacy rights in less than 7 days.

The statistics portal in the TSJDF web page ( http://estadistica.tsjdf.gob.mx/portal/) has
53 data banks available to the public on line on different subject matters.

Comment: The TSJDF Subproject did not include specialized and applied studies on
improving public access or transparency. However, these activities were carried out with
the TSJDF’s own resources for the benefit of the whole judiciary and the public at large.


Indicator 3.2. Increased opportunities for community engagement

On the basis of the only subproject financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s) the
modernization activities financed under the Project have increased opportunities for
community engagement of the Judiciary of the only participating subnational.

No specific community engagement activities were envisaged in the TSJDF Subproject,
but transparency and accountability through greater access to information provided
opportunities for such engagement. Five (5) court databases are operating through the
integrated network developed under the Project and accessible to court staff, and one
(SICOR) will be accessible to the general public. Monthly judicial statistics reports are
compiled for decision-making purposes. Annual statistics reports are published annually
and accessible online.

The increased demand for statistical information has prompted the TSJDF to finance
several community engagement activities with its own resources to expand links between
the Judiciary and civil society. With technical support from the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, the TSJDF has developed fair trial indicators and
completed the first measurement of these. With FLACSO, the TSJDF carried out a case
study to evaluate the application of human rights international treaties on TSJDF final
decisions. With a local civil society organization, EPADEC, the TSJDF conducted
assessments on the duration of cases and a user satisfaction survey, activity that the
TSJDF plans to repeat periodically. Finally with the Juridical Research Institute at the
National Autonomous University of Mexico, the TSJDF has started an assessment of the
quality of judicial decisions. These studies have started a new trend of involving civil
society organizations in assisting the TSJDF to measure its own performance.

Status as of May 2012: Partially Achieved

On the basis of the only subproject financed under the Project (the TSJDF’s) the
modernization activities financed under the Project have increased the number of users
from vulnerable groups of the Judiciary of the participating subnational. The
implementation of the new TSJDF management model supported by an integrated ICT
platform financed by the Project facilitates access of users from vulnerable groups.

No specific activities on vulnerable groups’ access to justice were carried out, but the
Project adapted infrastructure to users’ needs, including information and orientation
centers at the targeted courts (Reclusorios Norte, Oriente, Sur and Santa Marta Acatitla)
located in the vicinity of vulnerable group areas. According to National Council for the
Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL) in the areas where the target
courts are located between 25% to 50% of residents that live below the poverty line (see
Figure No. 8).

Comment:

The TSJDF Subproject did not provide financing for carrying out specialized and applied
studies for strengthening access to justice, special attention to women, minors, small
businesses, indigenous, the poor and socially disadvantaged, alternative mechanisms for
the resolution of disputes, diversifying the range of judicial services, strengthening public
defender and legal aid services, and strategies for improving collaboration with attorneys.
However, the selection of the target courts located in the vicinity of vulnerable group
areas had significant impact in terms of access to justice by these groups.

A cost-benefit analysis was conducted in 2008 to meet the Federal Government
requirements for the GDF to enter into a sub-loan agreement with BANOBRAS under a
credit program financed by external debt. The cost-benefit analysis was approved by
SCHP in May 2008 and served as the basis for the design of the TSJDF subproject
documentation, including the specific monitoring indicators tracked during subversion
and verified during the preparation of this ICR.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


The Borrower’s comments on an earlier draft, received on June 26, 2012, have been
reflected in this final version. However, BANOBRAS disagreed with its own rating as
Government agency which considers it to be Moderately Satisfactory (the same it
obtained as Implementing Agency).

The Bank explained to BANOBRAS the rationale for the different ratings in accordance
with the Bank’s ICR Guidelines.


Comentarios de BANOBRAS:

Las experiencias y la problemática enfrentada durante la ejecución del programa,
descritas en el informe de evaluación final, generaron importantes lecciones que deben
ser consideradas en los futuros proyectos conjuntos a ser desarrollados entre
BANOBRAS y el Banco Mundial.

Particularmente, como área de oportunidad, creemos que el Banco Mundial puede
perfeccionar el diseño de sus programas, específicamente los elementos necesarios para
asegurar la viabilidad de alcanzar los objetivos, metas e indicadores que se plantean.
Asimismo, un elemento fundamental en todo Programa de financiamiento, es el análisis y
la identificación de la viabilidad crediticia de los posibles sujetos de crédito.

En el caso del PMJ, consideramos que, además del análisis técnico en materia del
funcionamiento, perfil y necesidades del sector judicial, dimensionar e identificar
correctamente la normativa crediticia y el marco jurídico aplicable a los gobiernos
subnacionales en México habría permitido un mejor desempeño.

Es necesario citar que la realización de los primeros talleres de modernización judicial se
determinaron y se realizaron sólo a iniciativa del Banco Mundial. Consecuentemente,
algunos elementos del diseño del Programa, basados en información de dichos talleres y
contenidos en el Project Appraissal Document (PAD), se determinaron en etapas en las
que BANOBRAS aún no había sido incorporado al Programa, por lo que la evaluación de
BANOBRAS no debería considerar estos elementos que no son imputables a nuestra
institución.

Por otra parte, una vez que BANOBRAS accedió a impulsar el PMJ del Banco Mundial,
se detectó que era necesario formalizar la última enmienda que permitiría superar los
defectos de diseño al ajustar las expectativas del programa al único perfil que fue posible
instrumentar no obstante los esfuerzos conjuntos del BIRF, de BANOBRAS, de la SHCP
y de otros participantes por rescatar el Programa. La posibilidad de formalizar dicha
enmienda, que consumió recursos de BANOBRAS, fue finalmente desestimada por el
Banco Mundial (como se describe en el texto del Informe Final de Evaluación), no
obstante que se había determinado que era viable su formalización. Creemos que este tipo



                                            54
de programas pioneros deben ser tratados como programas pilotos para que los
participantes puedan aprender del proceso durante la ejecución del programa, y así poder
realizar los ajustes necesarios cuando se detectan a tiempo áreas de oportunidad.

Lo anteriormente expuesto habría permitido una evaluación más objetiva de
BANOBRAS, tanto como cliente y socio local del Banco Mundial. Consecuentemente, la
evaluación de BANOBRAS como prestatario y como agencia implementadora debieran
estar determinadas más por su desempeño en la administración y ejecución del préstamo
(programa), más que por su intervención en su diseño.
