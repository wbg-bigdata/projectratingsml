ZAMBIA - FERTILIZER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Zambia (the Government, GRZ)
has requested and this report recommends an International Development
Association (IDA) Credit (the Credit) of US$10 million equivalent to
finance the Fertilizer Industry Restructuring Project (the Project). The
Project would support the Government's major objective of restructuring the
Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia Ltd. (NCZ, the Company), the sole fertilizer
producer in the country, to improve the domestic supply of fertilizers. As
part of this objective the Project aims to restore the technical efficiency
and economic and financial viability of NCZ through a package of
appropriate policy, managerial, organizational, technical and financial
measures.
1.02      Zambia's development strategy gives high priority to agricultural
and rural development, especially in view of the declining earnings from
the copper mines. Within this context, the Government is giving greater
attention to achieving self-sufficiency in major foodstuffs and some other
commodities and to diversifying the economy to reduce dependence on copper
exports. The Project would be consistent with this strategy - improving
the efficiency of a key parastatal enterprise and increasing domestic
availability of fertilizers based on locally-prodtrced coal.
1.03      The Project complements physical investments in NCZ's facilities
with a set of policy and institutional reforms that are needed to improve
NCZ's performance. Specifically, the Project includes the following
measures/actions: Ci) managerial and organizational restructuring; (ii)
financial restructuring; (iii) cost reduction measures; (iv) ex-factory
pricing of products based on international prices; (v) operations
management services; (vi) technical coordination services; (vii) staff
training; and (viii) technical rehabilitation. These measures will be
impltemented on the (a) NCZ I plant; (b) NCZ II plant; and (c) off-site and
infrastructure facilities. IDA's primary role is to support the policy and
institutional reforms and the rehabilitation of off-site, infrastructure
and environmental facilities. IDA is particularly well placed to undertake
this role because of its involvement in other key sectors of the Zambian
economy, e.g. agriculture, mining, industry, transport and power, which are
critically linked to NCZ operations.
1.04      The Project is estimated to cost about US$83.75 million
equivalent (including working capital and interest during construction), of
which US$67.91 million, or 81 percent, will be in foreign exchange. The
proposed IDA Credit of US$10 million equivalent will cover about 12% of the
total Project cost; US$27.20 million (32%) will be provided by the Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG) and US$26.68 million (32%) by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan. The remaining US$19.87 million
(24%) will be financed by NCZ from internal funds. The Project is
technically sound and economically justified; the economic rate of return
(ERR) of NCZ's operations after the Project is implemented is estimated at



26.8% and net present value at US$50.1 million. The Project itself will
have a higher ERR of 30% (para 8.05). It is expected to save Zambia about
US$29 million in foreign exchange annually.
1.05      The Project was appraised in November 1984 by an IDA mission
consisting of Messrs. L. Borin (Chief), V. Goel and C. Frischtak of the
Industry Department followed by post-appraisal missions in April and August
1985. The appraisal mission was joined by the representatives of FRG.
Contacts were also maintalned with OECF, the other cofinancing agency, to
ensure an integrated approach to the restructw ing effort. Since then
continuous contacts were maintained with the Project authorities and the
co-lenders. This report reflects the results of the appraisal and
post-appraisal missions as well as the latest situation as prevailing in
January 1986.
II. ZAMBIA'S DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
A.  Background
2.01      During the late 1960s and 1970s, Zambia emphasized the develop-
ment of copper mining, giving low priority to other economic opportuni-
ties.   Alternative foreign exchange sources were not developed, and only
when, because of low copper prices, fiscal revenues and foreign exchange
earnings from mining declined in the mid-1970s did the authorities look for
other alternatives to generate additional revenue sources. Economic poli-
cies, including progressive overvaluation of the exchange rate and rising
industrial protection, discouraged agricultural growth and export diversi-
fication, and promoted the use of imported capital-intensive production
methods. Income policies that allowed public and private entities to adopt
high wage and benefit standards of the mining industry, together with heavy
consumer subsidies, led to overconsumption, while widespread price controls
distorted production incentives.
2.02      The shortcomings of the above strategy became fully apparent in
the mid-1970s when low copper prices, combined with steadily rising import
needs, started to erode Zambia's terms of trade.  By 1984, with copper
prices down to their lowest levels in four decades, Zambia's terms of trade
were 70% below the average for the early 1970s. The initial resoonse was
to borrow heavily in the external markets and, later, to allow external
arrears to accumulate. By end-1983, Zambia's total external liabilities
reached US$4.2 billion; and despite a 50% decline in import volume over the
past decade, the current account deficit in the balance of payments reached
20% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1981 and 22% in 1982. The
financial crisis came to a head in December 1982 when foreign suppliers
began requesting advance payments and external credit sources dried up.
2.03      By the early 1980s, the reduced availability of foreign exchange
for imports had taken a heavy toll on production and emplovment in Zambia's
import-dependent economy.  Capacity utilization had fallen sharply, parti-
cularly in industry, where by 1982 it averaged about 55x. Agriculture
became increasingly strapped for replacement machinery and spare parts and
output stagnated. Infrastructure such as the road and railroad network



- 3 -
eroded due to inadequate maintenance. Overall economic activity
contracted, following a downward trend since 1974.
B.   Stabilization and Adjustment Efforts
2.04      The critical situation in external indebtedness and in the
productive system led to the adoption of a package of stabilization
measures in 1983. The main measures included a freeze in Government
employment and wages; a 1OZ limit in wage increases in the private sector
(including mining); ceilings on banking system credit to the Government;
and substantial reduction in subsidies (mainly on maize and fertilizers).
In addition, and in a major break with past policies, Zambia's overvalued
exchange rate began to be adjusted downward. At the same time, a
unilateral moratorium on debt servicing was announced in January 1983 while
seeking International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance and debt relief from
-he Paris Club. The IMF approved standbv arrangements for SDR 211 million
in April 1983 and SDR 225 million in July 1984.
2.05      In addition to the above stabilization measures, the Government
outlined a new development strategy with the objective of resuming growth
and achieving economic efficiency. The main features of the new strategy
are summarized in a Memorandum of Development Objectives and Policies,
submitted to the Bank in January 1983 in connection with the Rank-financed
Export Rehabilitation and Diversification Project (Loan 2391-ZA), and have
been elaborated further in several subsequent documents, and most recently
in the Government's submission to the Consultative Group meeting in June
1985. The new strategy emphasizes the need to reduce (i) dependence on a
single export commodity (copper), (ii) imports of inputs and consumer
goods, and (iii) capital intensity in production. Consequently, the
Government's long-term strategy is to diversify the economy by providing
incentives for investments in agriculture and industry. In agriculture,
the main instruments include higher producer prices and support of
smallholder and export crops. In industry, where past strategy led to
development of inefficient firms selling to the domestic market behind the
protection of high import barriers, the main objectives are to increase
efficiency and export orientation, to restructure the sector by
concentrating rehabilitation efforts on the firms more likely to achieve
international competitiveness, and to improve the performance of
parastatals. This new strategy places greater reliance on market forces to
guide decisions and provides incentives for diversification and growth.
2.06      The GRZ has already moved significantly in the direction of the
new strategy. In October 1985 an open foreign exchange auction system was
introduced which has resulted in the devaluation of the Kwacha from about K
2.1 to US$1 in July 1985 to about 5.8 in December 1985. However, for
Zambia's new development strategy to succeed, there is need to continue
with the policy reforms and, in some cases, to accelerate them even
further. The GRZ is committed to this process and has requested further
financial assistance from the Bank and IMF--as well as from other external
donors-to be able to take the necessary measures while minimizing the
short-term costs of the adjustment. Such assistance is particularly needed
given the continuing low copper prices and high debt service payments that
will continue to pose serious constraints on Zambia's balance of payments
in the next few years.

C.   Industrial Sector Performance and Strategy
2.07      Zambia's manufacturing sector, which, excluding mining, accounts
for 18% of GDP, has followed and indeed magnified, the ups and downs of the
country's economic performance. Manufacturing was the leading growth
sector in the first decade after independence in 1964 (an average growth of
about 10% per annum (p.a.) during 1965-74). Subsequently, the fall in
copper earnings and the resulting economic recession affected industrial
output negatively-, by 1981, the index of manufacturing production had
declined by 13% compared with the 1974 level. By September 1983, the index
had further declined by 8% compared with 1981, and all available evidence
suggests that the decline has accelerated through 1984.
2.08      The main underlying factors that have affected the performance of
the manufacturing sector during the last two decades are the various policy
measures that provided protection to domestic industry. These included
widespread restrictions to imported goods competing with those manufactured
in Zambia, duty-free import of capital goods, raw materials and other
inputs and interest rate ceilings which encouraged capital-intensive
projects. At the same time, the investment code established multiple
controls and regulations. In addition, a major reason for the recent
decline in industrial production is the shortage of imported inputs due to
the reduced availability of foreign exchange, particularly important for
manufacturing because of the sector's high import intensity.
2.09      The characteristics and performance of Zambia's manufacturing
sector are determined to a large extent by the parastatal manufacturing
enterprises, which are grouped under the Industrial Development Corporation
Ltd. (INDECO), a Government holding company. Because INDECO firms account
for nearly two-thirds of the manufacturing value-added and 54% of the
sector's employment, any program to improve the economic efficiency of the
industrial cector cannot succeed without improving the performance of
parastatals. Many of these enterprises have incurred losses for several
years, partly because of past price controls, but also because of
inefficient operations and inadequate management. The profitability of
some of these firms improved after price controls were eliminated, but the
overall performance continues to remain relatively poor.
2.10      The GRZ has recognized the above problems and is taking steps to
deal with them. Beginning in 1982, the Bank undertock a series of
industrial sector missions with the purpose of establishing a basis for
comprehensive policy dialogue with the Government. These efforts
culminated in the preparation of an industrial sector report,1/ which was
discussed with the GRZ in June 1984. The report provides a review of the
main policy issues facing Zambia's industrial sector as well as specific
policy recommendations on short-term policy reforms. The major
recommendations of the report are: (i) strengthening of the existing
industrial structure by increasing capacity utilization, by making firms
more competitive at international prices through restructuring investments,
by phasing out those that cannot operate economically, and by enhancing
1/   ZAMBIA:  Industrial Policy and Performance; Report No. 4436-ZA, of
August 6, 1984.



managerial skills and productivity; (ii) reforming the incentive structure
by replacing quantitative restrictions with tariffs and by selective
changes in the tariff structure; (iii) promoting industrial exports by
providing incentives designed to offset the present bias against exports in
the protective structure; and (iv) limiting new projects in the public
sector and exercising strict economic criteria in their selection. The GRZ
has undertaken a series of initiatives consistent with these
recommendations.
D.  Bank Group Assistance
2.11      In recent years, the Bank Group strategy in Zambia has been to
support and encourage the process of structural adjustment of the economy.
This objective has been pursued through a combination of increased economic
and sector work, technical assistance in carrying out domestic policy
changes and seeking international support, in the context of Consultative
Group meetings, and with a lending strategy that emphasizes policy change
at the macro-economic level and in the main productive sectors (mining,
industry and agriculture). A major portion of the lending program has been
devoted to sectoral operations in the productive sectors.
2.12      First, the Export Rehabilitation and Diversification Project
(Loan 2391-ZA), in support of the mining sector, was approved in March
1984. The major objectives of the project are to rehabilitate the copper
mining sector to improve its performance and cost competitiveness, thereby
improving Zambia's balance of payments through continuing export and
foreign exchange earnings. Second, the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project
(Credit 1545-ZA), in support of the agriculture sector was approved in
January 1985. The major objectives of the project are to encourage and
support the GRZ's efforts in policy and institutional reforms in the
agricultural sector, to reverse the declining trend in marketed
agricultural output and to reinforce efforts to diversify the economy. The
project would also help to develop a specific program of action for the
policy measures needed for the development of the sector (e.g. farmer
services and incentives, economic pricing, agriculture marketing,
institutional strengthening, etc.). Third, an Industrial Reorientation
Project (Credit 1630-ZA) based on the recommendations of the recently
completed industrial sector report (para 2.10) was approved in October
1985. The main policy objectives of the project are to: (i) improve the
foreign exchange allocation and import licensing system; (ii) initiate
changes in the import tariff, protection and incentive systems; (iii)
improve economic analysis of new investment decisions and the evaluation of
psrformance of existing enterprise of both the private and public sectors;
and (iv) increase the promotion of non-traditional exports. Fourth, the
proposed Fertilizer Industry Restructuring Project will be another step in
supporting the GRZ's efforts in restructuring its economy. Specifically,
the Project would assist in increasing the performance efficiency and
capacity utilization of a key parastatal enterprise and improving domestic
production of fertilizers at prices comparable with imports. Other
additional objectives of the Project would be to initiate institution-
building and inter-sectoral coordination (para 5.03'.
2.13      Experience From Past Lending.  The Bank Group has no previous
involvement in lending to the fertilizer sector. Therefore, the Bank's



-6-
role in the sector should be looked at more in the related sectors of
industry and agriculture. In the past, except for the Export
Rehabilitation and Diversification Project, the Bank's lending in Zambia in
the industrial sector has been primarily to the Development Bank of Zambia
which ib of a different nature than the proposed Project. The major
lessons learned from the Export Rehabilitation and Diversification Project
relate to issues of management, coordination and foreign exchange. The
proposed Project has fully considered these experiences and has
incorporated measures to strengthen NCZ's management, improve inter-agency
coordination and address the foreign exchange issue. The main lessons
learned from lending to the agriculture sector, e.g. need for policy and
institutional reforms, marketing and distribution problems, economic
pricing, lack of farmer services, etc., have also been taken into account
in designing this Project.
III. THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
A.  Agricultural Background
3.01      Located in central southern Africa, Zambia is a land-locked
country with a land area of about 750,000 square kilometer (sq km),
supporting a population of about 6.3 million, which is growing at over 3%
p.a.. About 40% of the population now lives in urban areas, making Zambia
one of the most urbanized nations in Africa. Agriculture supports about
60% of Zambia's population, but accounts for only about 14% of GDP. As
mentioned earlier, the mining sector, which has traditionally dominated the
Zambian economy, and accounted for an overwhelming proportion of GDP and
foreign exchange earnings, is now facing a long-term decline. Further
economic growth, therefore, needs to be driven by the agricultural sector,
which has a large untapped potential; only about 12 million or 28% of the
estimated 43 million hectare (ha) of cultivable land is cultivated. About
85% of the total cultivable land is considered suitable for cropping and
grazing, although much of it is currently under indigenous forest and
woodland; the other 15% has soils which would not support crops, but could
be used for extensive grazing.
3.02      A large proportion of the country receives adequate rainfall,
although periodic droughts do occur. Total annual rainfall ranges from
about 700 mm (28 inches) in the Southern and Eastern provinces to above
1,400 mm (56 inches) in the Copperbelt, Luapula and North-Western
Provinces; much of the rainfall occurs between November and March. Tbp
development potential in stable river run-off and groundwater is
significant. Current use is estimated at only 4% of the potential and
rural areas use only about 0.1%. Most rivers have adequate flow for
irrigation development, but surface water network is limited.
3.03      Despite the country's sizeable resource base for agricultural
development (in terms of land, climate, water and human resources), the
sector has been almost stagnant in recent years, due to a combination of
factors. Budgetary resource allocation to agriculture has been inadequate,
in particular to support research and extension. Sectoral planning
capability (of both policies and programs) has been weak, and ill-conceived



-7-
marketing and pricing policies have caused severe distortions in the
economy and reduced producer incentives. The effects of policy distortions
and inadequate agricultural inputs and services have been compouwied by the
shortage of agricultural credit and the weakness of related institutions in
the country. As a result, the agricultural sector registered an annual
growth of about 2.4Z during 1965-83, compared to the population growth of
3.1% p.a. in the same period. Since 1983, however, the sector has shown
some tendency to a faster grovth as a result of the GRZ's efforts through
policy and institutional reforms and improved resource allocation.
3.04      The agricultural sector is markedly dualistic.  On one side, a
relatively modern sector of about 24,000 heavily-capitalized medium- and
large-scale commercial farmers, representing about 4% of the estimated
600,000 farm households, produce in value about 40X of the maize and 55% of
the other marketed agricultural products. On the other extreme, there are
about 456,000 farm families, or about 76% of the farm households,
cultivating an average of 2 ha, using family labor and simple hand tools
and producing mostly for subsistence. This dualism has been slightly
mitigated in recent years by the development of a smallholder (emergent)
market-oriented farming sector, numbering about 120,000 or 20% of the farm
households, and producing for the market. These farmers use modest levels
of mechanization and purchase seasonal inputs, especially fertilizers.
Together with occasional surpluses from traditional farmers, the emergent
farmers currently account for 60% of the value of marketed maize, 85% of
the value of sunflower seeds and nearly all sales of rice, seed cotton and
groundnuts.
3.05      Maize is the dominant crop throughout Zambia with cassava,
sorghum and millet as the other major food crops in some areas. Over
400,000 ha are under maize and it accounts for about 75% of the total value
of marketed crop production. Groundnuts are widely grown, as are beans,
other legumes, minor cereals, oilseeds and root crops. Trends in the
agricultural output are presented below.

3.06      In the past, the agricultural production has been quite volatile;
however, in 1984, production in general has shown a marked improvement.
Marketed production of maize increased at an average annual rate of 11.2Z
during 1970-80, declining to 10.6% p.a. during 1980-83. Production of
Virginia tobacco declined by 1.5% p.a. during 1970-80, and 10.7% p.a.
during 1980-83. Production of wheat, sunflower seeds and soya beans
increased remarkably during 1975-84 at an annual growth of 30.4, 19.3 and
43.6 percent, respectively, but sti'l remains small in absolute terms.
Production of seed cotton and sugar cane has also increased consistently
during 1970-84. The agricultural sector output value increased by 1.2%
p.a. during 1975-83, from K 157 million in 1975 to K 172.3 million in
1983. The commercial sector output value increased from K 56.3 million in
1975 to K 68.3 million in 1983, at a modest rate of 2.4% p.a., while the
subsistence sector virtually stagnated, increasing from K 100.7 million in
1975 to only K 104 million in 1983, an annual rate of only 0.4%.
3.07      Zambia's degree of self-sufficiency in major food crops has
declined from 97% during 1964-66 to only 79% during 1978-80. The
agricultural exports in 1982 accounted for less than 2. of Zambia's total
export value. The only regalar exports are tobacco and confectionary
groundnuts, but they account for less than 1% of the total export
earnings. Imports of agricultural commodities, on the other hand, still
accounted for 10% of total import value in 1982. The major imported
agricultural goods have been cereals (mainly wheat and rice), dairy
products, and vegetable oil and oilseed cakes. The decline in food
self-sufficiency is a reflection of slow growth in agricultural
productivity under conditions of rapid population growth. Unless
improvements are made in agricultural productivity and production, the
current population growth is likely to have more serious implications on
the Zambian economy, in the mediumr to long-run. Inspite of substantial
untapped land potential, a large part of the increased agricultural
production will have to come from improved farming practices, including
increased and improved use of fertilizers. The GRZ has recognized the need
for pursuing a long-term strategy which would deveiop the country's
agricultural potential, in particular by promoting small-scale farming.
The GRZ is evaluating, with Bank assistance, appropriate changes in
existing agricultural policy as well as in institutions currently
responsible for managing and servicing the sector. The major objectives of
these reforms would be to (i) improve institutional and resource allocation
efficiency; and (ii) effect long-term and sustained growth through improved
farm technological base.
B.   Fertilizer Use, Demand and Supply
1. Fertilizer Use
3.08      Zambia is one of the largest fertilizer consumers in Africa.  The
fertilizer products currently in use are principally limited to two single
nutrient nitrogen fertilizers (ammonium nitrate and urea) and six NPK
compound fertilizer formulae.   Direct use of phosphate fertilizers, such
as single super phosphate (SSP) or triple super phosphate (TSP), is
negligible. Compounds A, C and V are specifically formulated for tobacco,
and their use has been declining from an aggregate of about 12,200 tons in
1975 to 3,100 tons in 1983, due to decline in tobacco production. On the



other hand, consumption of compounds R, X and D, more generally applied as
basal fertilizer (in November-December), has been increasing from an
aggregate of about 62,500 tons in 1975 to 72,800 tons of product in 1983
(Annex 3-1). Ammonium nitrate (AN) and urea are applied as top dressing
(in January). Urea use has been growing steadily from 32,000 tons in 1975
to 52,600 tons in 1983, as domestic production of AN (at NCZ plant) has
been limited in recent years. Consequently, the share of urea in total
straight nitrogen fertilizers has increased from 66Z in 1975 to 81% in 1983
(in terms of nutrient). However, even under current unfavorable pricing
conditions (in terms of nutrient value), some farmers still prefer AN to
urea. This could reflect traditional attitudes of farmers who favour
application of less concentrated fertilizers or could simply be a matter of
availability at local depots.
3.09      There is increasing concern that current fertilizer usage
pattern and recommendations may not be consistent with the needs of diverse
soil and crop conditions faced by the Zambian farmers. For example, all
compound fertilizer formulae (domestically produced or imported) contain
8-12% sulfur, based on the widespread sulfur deficiency in the Zambian
soils identified in field work carried out in the 1960s. More recently,
there have been doubts on the extent to which sulfur is really needed and
concern whether, at least in some regions, the present levels of sulfur
application could be detrimental to soils, accelerating their acidifica-
tion. This has been a major problem in Zambia, especially in high rainfall
regions, leading to decreasing yields. Furthermore, specific sulfur-
containing compound fertilizers generally cost more as these formulations
are not commonly in demand elsewhere and have to be custom-manufactured by
foreign suppliers, and supplied to Zambia at a high premium.
3.10     There is an urgent need to develop fertilizer application
recommendations, based on updated on-field research programs, specific to
location, climate, soil and cropping patterns. The GRZ has already taken
important steps in this direction, partly with Bank assistance.  The
constraints to agricultural research and extension have been analyzed in a
recently completed agricultural research and extension review. Appropriate
recommendations of the study are being incorporated under a proposed
Agricultural Research and Extension Project, where measures will be taken
to reorganize research and extension services and develop action programs
that are more problem- and farmer-oriented.
2.   Fertilizer Demand
3.11      Historical consumption, production, and imports of fertilizers in
Zambia are given in Annexes 3-1 and 3-2 and summarized in Table 3.2 on the
following page.
3.12      Consumption of all fertilizers in nutrient terms increased from
51,300 tpy in 1975 to 66,900 tpy in 1983, at an average rate of 3.4% p.a..
During 1975-80, annual consumption of all fertilizers increased at an
average rate of 8.7X, but during 1980-83, the consumption declined by an
average 3.6% p.a.. While nitrogen and phosphate consumption has followed

similar trends, potash consumption has shown a relatively lower growth rate
possibly reflecting the decline in tobacco production. About 90% of the
fertilizer consumed (expressed as nutrients) is on maize crops. Regional
breakdown of consumption varies slightly from year to year but generally
reflects the regional maize production pattern, with the Southern, Eastern
and Central provinces together accounting for some 75Z of the total
fertilizer consumption.
3.13      Fertilizer application rate in Zambia averages about 16 kg/ha,
compared to 65 kg/ha in Zimbabwe, 6.5 in Sudan, 26 in Kenya, and 18.4 for
the whole of Africa. However, in the absence of reliable basic information
on fertilizer use by crop or by type of farm it is difficult to derive any
useful conclusions. The commercial sector uses fertilizers, on the
average, at levels not far from the 'optimal, as recommended by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Development (MAWD) and research
institutes such as the Mount Makulu Research Station. For example,
fertilizer application rates for maize adopted by commercial farmers range
between 100 and 230 kg of nutrients/ha.



- 11 -
3.14      In the small farmer sector, the situation is not very clear for
the purposes of evaluating application rates, mainly for the following
reasons: (i) small-scale farmers have little idea of the precise size of
their cropped area; and (ii) the difference in terms of nutrient
content between fertilizers seems to be widely unknown, in some cases even
to the management of the distribution agencies. Considering that the
subsistence farmers make negligible use of fertilizers, it has been argued
that other farmers possibly use too much of fertilizer and that the growth
of maize production has not followed the growth of fertilizer consumption.
However, such an argument is not factually supported due to the limited
reliable knowledge on the area cropped, especially -n maize, on the share
fertilized and how the fertilizers are applied, especially by the
small-scale farmers. There are also wide fluctuations in fertilizer
applications in the small-scale sector, partly due to inadequate extension
services, arising out of lack of equipment, training and organization.
Furthermore, extension recommendations/messages do not always reflect
research findings. As a result, past fertilizer application data are
imprecise.
3.15      It is difficult at this stage to project future fertilizer demand
although better knowledge is expected to be achieved as a result of GRZ's
efforts, under the proposed Agricultural Research and Extension Project, to
reorganize and improve extension services and technical support to farmers,
and by strengthening the capabilities of the Planning Division of MAWD.
Uncertainties due to lack of accurate data on application rates and
fertilizer use by type of crop, farming systems, etc., are further
aggravated by difficulties in extrapolating historical consumption rates,
due to periodic occurrences such as (i) drought, which reduces fertilizer
usage, especially for top dressing; (ii) untimely changes in relative crop
and fertilizer prices which discourage fertilizer application; and (iii)
lack of adequate supplies in the planting season, due to poor procurement
and scheduling arrangements for imported fertilizers and inadequate
distribution organization (para 3.22).
3.16      The present report projects fertilizer demand, based on
conservative assumptions on likely breakdown of fertilizer use between
commercial farmers and smallholders, and by type of crop, allowing suitably
for fertilizer losses/misuses at the farm level. The fertilized area
for each major crop has been estimated using total crop production and
typical yield-. The crop production data for this purpose are the
official data on marketed production increased suitably to allow for
non-commercialized consumption which could have come from fertilized land.
The fertilizer consumption for each crop has been calculated based on the
area planted as determined above and by using estimated average application
rates. Reliable data on application rates exist only for the commercial
sector. The application rate for emergent farmers have been estimated,
based on experience in neighboring countries, and the recommended
application rate for hybrid maize (ZHl)--cultivated by most small-scale
farmers--at roughly half the rate in the commercial sector. On this basis,
fertilizer consumption expressed in nutrient (based on 1980 consumption
level which is considered the most representative) is expected to grow on
an average at 0.9% p.a. for nitrogen and phosphate and at somewhat lower
rate of 0.5% p.a. for potash due to decline in tobacco production. Thus,
nitrogen demand in 1995 is expected to be about 61,000 tons, P205 about



- 12 -
22,000 tons and potash (K20) about 7,000 tons. Detailed demand forecasts
by farming system, type of dressing and type of fertilizer, together with
an explanatory note on forecast assumptions, are given in Annex 3-3.
Forecasts by nutrient type are summarized in Table 3.2 on page 10.
3.   Fertilizer Supply
3.17      Zambia obtains its fertilizer supplies both from domestic
production at the NCZ's plant (ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate
and NPK compounds) and from imports (mainly urea, NPK compounds, TSP and
SSP) as shown below.

Source: NAMBOARD and NCZ.
If the NCZ plant were able to operate at full capacity, it could meet about
90% of the country's present nitrogen requirements, but its present output
is limited and represents only about 25% of the country's needs. (NCZ
production constraints are discussed in para 4.04.) All phosphate and
potash requirements are met through imports. In recent years, fertilizers
procured under bilateral aid programs have come mainly from the United
States, Netherlands, Norway and Japan against grants or long-term soft
loans. The United States assistance is now used to fund imports of
phosphate and potash intermediates for use by NCZ. As a result, the share
of finished fertilizers obtained through bilateral aid programs has
declined dramatically from 96,230 tons in 1979 to 6,300 tons in 1983.
Details on fertilizer supplied under bilateral aid programs are given in
Annex 3-4.
4.   Fertilizer Demand and Supply Balance
3.18      As seen from Table 3.2 on page 10, fertilizer supply has
fluctuated more widely than demand, leading to shortages in some years and
very high stocks in others. By the end of 1983, stocks were as high as
156,000 tons of fertilizer (90,000 tons at the storage depots and 66,000
tons in transit and at the ports). Purchases in 1984 amounted to 260,000



- 13 -
tons, leading to 416,000 tons of available supplies, compared with an
estimated demand of 175,000 tons. Such imbalance reflects: (i)
unsatisfactory planning forecasts and procurement procedures for imported
fertilizers; and (ii) unreliable production by NCZ, especially since 1980.
Consumption forecasts have been overly optimistic in the past several
years, in addition to fertilizers often arriving after the planting season
due to delays in procurement, resulting in high levels of stocks.
3.19      The study of reforms and improvements in the planning and
organization of fertilizer distribution being addressed under the
Agricultural Rehabilitation Project should identify policy reforms,
institutional changes and other measu-res to achieve a more balanced and
cost-effective fertilizer supply planning and organization; this should
lead to importing fertilizers on a more timely basis and reducing high
inventories. As shown in Table 3.2, even after rehabilitation of NCZ
facilities which would increase their production to 45,600 tpy of nitrogen,
there would still be a gap between domestic production and consumption, of
12,000 tons of nitrogen in 1990 and increasing to 15,000 tons in 1995.
C. Fertilizer Distribution and Marketing
3.20      All fertilizer imports are through the two ports:  Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania (1.800 km from Lusaka) and East London, South Africa (1,500 km
from Lusaka) from where they are railed to the National Agricultural
Marketing Board (NAMBOARD) depots. Even though bo-th local and imported
fertilizers are transported in bags, fertilizer transport and storage
result at present in heavy losses, estimated at 15-20%. This estimate does
not include possible losses due to misuse or poor storage conditions at the
farmer level. In addition., because of improper procurement practices and
foreign exchange shortages, fertilizers do not arrive in time. As a
result, fertilizers often arrive when the application season has ended and
have to be stored for the next season resulting in losses and high storage
costs, caking of product and need for partial rebagging. Improved and more
reliable supplies from NCZ will minimize these risks and costs.
3.21      In Zambia, fertilizers are distributed by governmental or
parastatal agencies. NAMBOARD, a parastatal organization established in
1969 by the merger of two previous marketing parastatals, deals in the
in-country and international trade of agricultural commodities. In
addition, it retains the monopoly for the procurement of fertilizers both
from the domestic plant and imports (commercial and bilateral aid); the
only exceptions are the phosphate and potash intermediates imported
directly by NCZ for compound fertilizer production. NAMBOARD has the
overall responsibility for forecasting demand, procuring fertilizers and
delivering them to the 17 NAMBOARD provincial depots (Map No. IBRD 18861).
3.22      Due to changes in agricultural policy, the earlier activity of
NAMBOARD at rural and local levels has been progressively taken over since
1981 by the Cooperative Marketing Unions (CMUs) which are now responsible
for all rural marketing activities and distribution of fertilizers and
other inputs to the farmers. CMUs move fertilizers from NAMBOARD depots to
their own outlets, and have the responsibility for final distribution to
the farmers. A separate ministry, Ministry of Cooperatives and Marketing,
has been formed to strengthen the role of CMUs, which were previously under



- 14 -
MAWD. However, such institutional change, aimed at better efficiency, has
so far not shown any perceptible improvement in the distribution system.
Both NAMBOARD and CMUs are poorly managed, overstaffed, lack adequate
experienced personnel, are facing financial problems and are inefficient in
marketing and distribution.
3.23      As mentioned earlier, the GRZ has already taken several steps
towards stimulating the economy in general and agricultural growth in
particular. With Bank assistance, the GRZ is formulating a system of
incentives to farmers based on a well defined agricultural development
strategy. In addition, it is undertaking a thorough review of the range of
services available to the farmers, and particularly to the smallholders,
including research, extension, input supply and marketing services. In
this context, through the Agricultural Rehabilitation Project, specific
studies to improve marketing efficiency of NAMBOARD and CMUs by reducing
operating costs and allowing private sector participation to introduce
competition have been undertaken. The GRZ is expected to announce soon a
number of measures to improve marketing and distribution of agricultural
products and inputs including the efficiency of NAMBOARD and CMUs. Within
this context, the GRZ is also considering alternative options to make
import and distribution of agricultural inputs more efficient, in
particular, termination of NAMBOARD monopoly on fertilizer, imports, with
partial or complete shift of such responsibility to other agencies or to
NCZ itself.
D.  Fertilizer Pricing
3.24      In Zambia, producer prices of the main crops are controlled by
the Government although consumer prices have been recently decontrolled,
with the exception of maize. Fertilizer prices are also controlled by the
Government. For many years, the GRZ pursued an agricultural policy which
maintained low crop prices by subsidizing fertilizers. Until 1982, crop
producer prices remained substantially below border price equivalents, and
crop retail prices were below the total of production and marketing costs;
as a result, subsidies to the consumers mounted. Fertilizer retail prices
also remained below their landed cost (i.e., the cost of imported fertil-
izers CIF Lusaka not including distribution costs within Zambia). In 1980,
the retail price of urea was K 233/ton compared to its landed cost of K
400/ton. With increasing economic difficulties, the GRZ recognized the
need to modify its agricultural pricing policy towards the principle of
full cost recovery. By November 1984, all crop ccnsumer prices were decon-
trolled, except those of maize. Fertilizer retail prices were also
substantially increased to reflect their landed cost.
3.25      A historical comparison of fertilizer CIF landed cost, retail
prices and NCZ ex-factory prices is shown in Annex 3-5, and summarized in
Table 3.4 on the following page. In 1983 and 1984, retail price of urea
was established at its landed cost equivalent (K 482/ton and K 535/ton,
respectively), while the retail prices of NPK compounds were set at between
K 466 and K 482/ton in 1983 and between K 499 and 535/ton in 1984 depending
on their formulae, about 20% higher than their landed cost.

3.26      In the past, NCZ's ex-factory prices have substantially exceeded
both their equivalent CIF landed cost and the corresponding retail prices.
For example, in 1981, ex-factory price for R compound was about i3Z higher
than the CIF landed cost and about 104Z higher than the retail price.
However, the 1984 er-factory price of R compound has become 30% higher than
the CIF landed cost, but as a result of the increase in retail prices in
recent years, is only 25% higher than the retail price; other compound
prices followed the same trend. While retail prices have increased faster
than the ex-factory prices, in the recent years the gap between ex-factory
prices and equivalent CIF landed cost has been widening due to: (i)
depressed international market for NPK compounds, resulting in lowering of
prices, in current terms, by 5 to 14% during 1981-83; and (ii) decline in
operating performance of NCZ and as a result the need for price increases
to cover at least partially its increasing production costs. However,
since 1985 this trend has reversed due to the progressive devaluation of
kwacha and the present NCZ ex-factory as well as rerail prices are below
equivalent CIF landed cost. In January 1986, the er-factory price of AN
and compounds was increased to K 1,300/ton and the retail prices are also
expected to follow suit to bring them closer to CIF cost.
3.27      At the present level of retail prices, fertilizer distribution
costs are not fully passed on to the farmers but are partly borne by the
GRZ, which contributes to NAMBOARD towards its distribution and storage
costs and to CHUs their fertilizer marketing costs. The GRZ paid NAMBOARD
K 50 million in 1980, K 37.9 million in 1981, K 50.3 million in 1982, K
19.9 million in 1983 and K 20.1 million in 1984 towards distribution and
storage costs of fertilizers.
3.28      Payments to NAMBOARD are based on sales volume estimated at the
beginning of each year. Since the payment is not adjusted later for any
changes in sales volume, there is no incentive for NAMBOARD and CMUs to
stimulate further fertilizer sales. On the contrary, NAMBOARD tends to
overestimate projected sales to claim higher allocation for its costs and
generally has higher than the required levels of purchased stocks. As
mentioned earlier, the GRZ has already taken steps towards achieving full
cost recovery while improving fertilizer marketing and distribution



- 16 -
efficiency. The GRZ has initiated, with Bank support, formulation of a
price setting methodology which relates retail domestic fertilizer prices
to the landed cost equivalent, and has commenced a study on CMUs' costs to
have a firm basis for determining appropriate trading margins to fully
recover their marketing costs. Such price mechanisms should improve the
financial condition of NAMBOARD and the CMUs.
3.29      Although fertilizers represent the major input cost for farmers,-
forming about 30% of the production cost, the past evolution and
adjustments (in crop and fertilizer prices) have not significantly affected
the economics of fertilizer application. Comparison of the historical
fertilizer/crop price ratios show that the ratio of nitrogen to maize
prices has remained at reasonably satisfactory levels-ranging between 2.5
and 4.2 during 1975-1982, increasing to 5.2 in 1983 and then decreasing to
4.2 in 1984 (Annex 3-6). However, delays and inadequate frequency in
adjusting crop prices when fertilizer prices are increased have on
occasions discouraged fertilizer application, as was the case in 1983/84.
IV. THE PROJECT SPONSORS
A. Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation
4.01      The Zambia Industrial and Mining Corporation Ltd. (ZIMCO), a
Government-owned corporation, is the holding company of most
state-controlled enterprises in Zambia, including NCZ and INDECO.  ZIMCO
owns some 111 public sector companies in the field of mining, industry,
energy, agriculture, transport, finance, hotels, trading, communications
and real estate. The Group's Board of Directors consists of 24 members and
is chaired by the President of the Republic, who also appoints the Board
members. Other members represent various political and professional
interests. ZIMCO's day-to-day management rests with its Director General,
who is assisted by four Executive Directors and a Finance Director; ZIhCO's
current organization structure is given in Annex 4-1. Being a holding
company with limited staff, ZIMCO provides overall guidance to its
companies and their day-to-day management is the responsibility of the
individual company management.
4.02      Until April 1985, NCZ was a subsidiary of INDECO, which is a
fully-owned subsidiary of ZIMCO. INDECO currently owns some 37 companies
in various industrial subsectors including chemicals, cement, textiles,
auto assembling, light-engineering, sugar and food processing. The
company's Board of Directors, made up of eleven members nominated by ZIMCO,
is chaired by the Director General of ZIMCO. Day-to-day management of
INDECO is conducted by its Managing Director, who is supported by three
Deputy Managing Directors. Except with NCZ, INDECO's experience has been
mainly in the area of light and medium industries. NCZ was the largest
company in the INDECO Group; during 1983, NCZ accounted for about 43% of
INDECO's fixed assets, 40% of its long-term debt and 55% of its share
capital. NCZ was transferred to ZIMCO in April 1985 primarily to provide
NCZ with (i) strong management with adequate autonomy and authority; (ii)
more flexibility on salary, procurement, pricing and other institutional



- 17 -
matters; (iii) proper hierarchical status necessary to work effectively
with other ZIMCO Group of companies, e.g., Maamba Collieries (MCL), Zambia
Railways (ZR), etc., critical to its operations; and (iv) an appropriate
business environment being the largest (excluding mines) and most complex
industrial investment in the country.
B. Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia
1.   Background
4.03      The Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia Ltd. (NCZ, the Company), now a
direct subsidiary of ZIMCO (effective April 1, 1985) is the sole fertilizer
producer in Zambia. The Company was established in September 1967 to
construct and operate a coal-based ammonium nitrate plant at Kafue (some 30
km from Lusaka) mainly to produce explosive grade AN and nitric acid for
further processing into blasting agents for the mining industry. As it was
clear from the beginning that production of explosive grade AN alone would £
not support an economically sized plant, the scope of the facilities was
expanded to include AN production for use as fertilizers. The facilities
were further expanded when NCZ IT plant, which became operational in 1982,
was added to produce compound fertilizers as well as to increase AN
production.
4.04      In the past few years, NCZ has encountered a wide range of
problems, such as major design/technical deficiencies in NCZ II plant,
shortage and poor quality of the principal feedstock, coal, due to
operational problems at MCL and ZR, shortage of foreign exchange (which
prevented timely purchase of spare parts, chemicals and catalysts, bags and
NPK intermediates), inadequate management, inadequate technical expertise,
poor operational and maintenance practices, and overstaffing. As a result,
capacity utilization declined progressively to the present level of under
30% resulting in substantially higher than international production costs.
Although some of the Company's problems have beer due to Zambia's difficult
economic situation, most of the difficulties began with the construction of
NCZ II plant. The expansion project, which faced severe completion delays
and never operated well due to major design deficiencies, strained NCZ's
organization and management capabilities, intensified the shortage of
technical expertise and drained its financial resources. This affected the
performance of NCZ I plant as well, which had otherwise been operating
efficiently (para 4.12).
2.   Board and Management
4.05       NCZ's Board of Directors, which is now chaired by a ZIMCO
Executive Director, consists of ten members appointed by ZIMCO. (Until
recently the Managing Director of INDECO, who is the Chairman and .1anaging
Director of some 12 other INDECO companies, was also the Chairman and
Managing Director of NCZ.) The other members of the Board are: the
Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance (MOF); the Permanent Secretary,
MAWD; the Managing Director of MCL, the supplier of coal to NCZ; the
Chairman of Barclays Bank, the main bank of NCZ; a representative of the
Commercial Farmers' Bureau to represent fertilizer consumers; and a
representative of Kobe Steel of Japan which owns K I million of NCZ's
preferred stock.   In addition, as a part of the restructuring of the



- 18 -
Board, the Managing Director of NCZ, an experienced private sector
industrialist, and a trade union leader have been appointed members of the
NCZ Board. Although, in the past, the functions of the Board were that of
advice and policy making, it occasionally addressed itself to operational
matters. In addition, INDECO, as the former owner of NCZ and with a common
Managing Director, also used to get involved in many aspects such as
personnel, procurement, production and engineering which should be dealt
with more appropriately at the NCZ management level. Of course, part of
this practice developed because of the fact that NCZ had been experiencing
serious technical and financial problems which had direct impact on
INDECO's performance and profitability, being the largest company in the
Group. The General Manager of NCZ lacked the appropriate status,
authority, and time to deal effectively with the outside (plant)
environment, in particular with the problems which arise from NCZ's
relations with MCL, ZR, NAMBOARD, MOF and the Bank of Zambia (BOZ).
4.06      Given the sophisticated and complex technology involved in NCZ
operations, and its financial and strategic importance to Zambia, there was
need to strengthen the top management of NCZ and give it adequate autonomy,
authority and accountability to manage the company efficiently. Under the
Project, steps are being taken to address these institutional problems. As
a result, NCZ has been transferred from INDECO and made a direct subsidiary
of ZIMCO and a new Chairman has been appointed. An experienced expatriate
industrialist has been appointed to the newly created position of full-time
Managing Director. In addition, NCZ's Board and corporate responsibilities
have been restructured (para 5.05).
3.   Internal Organization
4.07      NCZ's current organization structure is presented in Annex 4-2.
Over the years, NCZ's organization has remained more or less the same
except for some occasional minor changes. This set-up served its purpose
rather well when NCZ was small, before the addition of NCZ II and sulfuric
acid plants. However, the present organizational structure is cumbersome,
top heavy and is not well suited for efficient operation of such complex
facilities. Some crucial functions such as distribution logistics, quality
control, cost control and internal auditing do not exist. The financial
planning, budgeting, accounting and management information systems are
still weak despite some improvements during the past few years. There is
lack of clear definition of authorities and responsibilities of various
middle-level managers. Under the Project, an experienced Operations
Management Firm (OMF) is, inter alia, undeitaking a comprehensive review of
NCZ's current organization to ide. tify constraints and introduce proper
changes in organizational structure, operational procedures and systems,
inter-divisional relationship, autonomy and authority levels, and introduce
a management culture conducive to efficient operations (para 5.09).
4. Staffing and Training
4.08      As of end 1985, NCZ employed 1,270 staff, including some 27
expatriates. The staff strength has grown from 515 in 1969, to 647 in
1970, 1,425 in 1981 and 1,580 in 1984 as the operations grew. At the same
time, the number of expatriates came down from 207 in 1970 to 46 in 1981
but later increased (52 in 1983 and 59 in 1984) when the NCZ II plant was



- 19 -
commissioned. These expatriates are hired in line positions to complement
the technical expertise of Zambian personnel primarily as plant operators
and maintenance personnel although a few are filling middle level
managerial/supervisory positions. Initially, the plant was operated by an
expatriate management firm (during 1970-74) before the local management
took over and operated the facilities well until the start of NCZ II
plant. The level of expertise of Zambian personnel, though reasonable, has
not been fully adequate to operate properly the technologically complex
facilities. While the capabilities of expatriates currently employed are
reasonable, some are not up to the standards needed for NCZ, reflecting
partly the low levels of compensation and limits on remitting abroad part
of their earnings. The process of Zambianization, desirable from a
national standpoint, may have gone too fast and been counter-productive in
this case.
4.09      In addition, NCZ was significantly overstaffed; the labor costs
accounted for over 35% of the fixed costs (excluding depreciation and
finance charges.) The 1984 staffing level exceeded the usual level for
such facilities by about 30%, even after adjusting for the complex
technology and limited access to subcontracting in Zambia. A comprehensive
job evaluation of all positions is therefore needed to establish the
optimum staffing level and to define clearly the responsibility, authority,
compensation level, qualifications and experience for each position. Under
the Project, the OMF, hired to operate the plant for a period of four
years, is also carrying out a comprehensive review of the staffing pattern
and will recommend optimum staffing levels and a compensation package (para
5.08). As a part of this exercise NCZ has already reduced its staff
strength from 1,580 in end 1984 to 1,270 by end 1985; further reductions
are being considered.
4.10      Training.  In 1983/84, 10 NCZ staff underwent training abroad
while 91 staff received training locally. (NCZ has its own training
center). The regular staff training program carried out by NCZ has not
been well focused. Training is particularly needed in the area of plant
operations and maintenance. There is clearly a need to develop a more
realistic and objective-oriented training program for the NCZ staff. The
Project includes a comprehensive training program to upgrade the skills of
NCZ personnel (para 5.10).
5. Operational Performance
4.11      NCZ's plant design capacities are given on the following page.
NCZ's fertilizer complex comprises two lines of production. Construction
of the first line (NCZ I plant) started in early 1968 with a Japanese
contractor responsible for the overall design, supply of machinery and
equipment, erection, construction, and supervision of the commissioning of
the plant on a turnkey basis. The plant, commissioned in May 1970,
initially faced some technical and operational problems and production
could be stabilized only by 1973. This plant was designed for an output of
95 tons per day (tpd) of coal-based ammonia (NH3) corresponding to about
59,000 tpy of AN. However, design deficiencies (limitations in the ammonia
synthesis unit) identified during commissioning have limited output to 83
tpd of NH3, thus reducing the attainable AN output to about 52,000 tpy.

4.12      As shown in Table 4.2 on the followlng page, the NCZ I plant
performed efficiently with an average capacity utilization of about 94%
during 1973-79, a remarkable performance considering the complex technology
involved, the relative inexperience of the staff and the constraints posed
by the remoteness of the plant. However, since 1980. it has been showing a
sharp decline in production and has deteriorated rapidly. The plant now
requires substantial rehabilitation to restore its physical integrity.
Under the Project, technical rehabilitation of this plant is being under-
taken to enable it to operate at over 85Z capacity (para 5.18).

4.13      Construction of the second line (NCZ II plant), under the
implementation responsibility of INDECO, started in 1975 with a consortium
of German and French contractors responsible for the overall design, supply
of machinery and equipment, erection, construction and commissioning. The
utilities and outside-battery-limit infrastructure associated with this
line were implemented by INDECO itself. The facilities include a 220 tpd
coal-based ammonia unit, a 212 tpd nitric acid unit, a 240 tpd ammonium
nitrate unit and a 420 tpd compound fertilizer plant. A 150 tpd ammonium
sulfate (AS) plant was added in 1978. Due to various reasons (southern
border closure, disruption of transport routes, lack of foreign and
domestic resources, managerial weakness, etc.) the expansion project
experienced severe delays and cost overruns. In 1980, INDECO transferrEd
to NCZ the responsibility for completion and subsequent start-up and
commissioning of the expansion project. The facilities were finally
commissioned in April 1982, seven years after the zero date, and have never
been able to operate well due to several design faults and technological
deficiencies in the ammonia unit. The maximum production ever achieved is
less than 40% of the design capacity.
4.14      In particular, equipment in the nitrogen washing section of the
ammonia unit is undersized and the achievable capacity of this unit cannot
exceed 55% of the rated capacity. Design faults have also been detected in
the coal gasifier, carbon dioxide (CO2) washing section of the ammonia unit
as well as in the air compressor and boiler sections of the nitric acid
unit. Also, incorrect specifications were used for piping material in the
AN unit. Design deficiencies compounded with shortage of chemicals have
also caused abnormal corrosion of equipment, especially in the raw gas
compressor unit and the hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal section of the
ammonia unit. The facilities have also deteriorated rapidly due to poor
maintenance practices and lack of spares. The plant now requires major
rehabilitation to remove design bottlenecks and replace deteriorated
parts. Under the Project, technical rehabilitation of the plant will be
undertaken to restore its physical integrity enabling it to operate at over
85% of its design capacity (para 5.19).
4.15      During conception of NCZ II plant, it was envisaged that the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd. (ZcCM) would supply sulfuric acid
(41,000 tpy) for the AS plant included in the expansion project. However,
by 1979, it was evident that ZCCM would not be able to supply sulfuric acid
and NCZ decided to construct its own sulfuric acid plant based on locally
available pyrites. Construction of the plant started in April 1981 and the
plant entered commercial operation in October 1983. The plant, designed
for 60,000 tpy of sulfuric acid, has been operating satisfactorily.
However, during 1984, problems in getting pyrites from the Nampundwe mine
have resulted in some production cuts. Pyrites supply is expected to
improve when the planned improvements of the mine, to be carried out by
ZCCM, are completed during 1986 (para 5.28).
4.16      As can be seen from Table 4.3 on the following page, the NCZ I
plant was substantially undersized for the prevailing demand for
fertilizers when it started production in 1970. Production capacity was
only 12,700 tpy Nitrogen (N) as fertilizer grade AN while the 1971/72
nitrogen fertilizer demand in Zambia was already about 26,000 tpy N. A

larger NCZ I plant capacity based on better demand estimates could possibly
have improved production economics. By the time NCZ II plant went on
stream in April 1982, the overall nitrogen supply capacity (not production)
of NCZ was about balanced vis-a-vis demand. Nevertheless, the plant size
(about 303 tpd of NH3) still remains small compared to sizes of about
1,000-1,500 tpd of ammonia considered internationally optimum. However,
further expansion of capacity at this stage would not be economical as coal
Is no longer the preferred economical feedstock for ammonia production in
the fertilizer industry.
6.   Financial Performance
4.17      NCZ's financial statements are audited annually by an
international accounting firm and auditing arrangements and procedures are
satisfactory. NCZ also carries adequate insurance coverage for its
facilities. Selected historical financial data are given in Annex 4-3, and
summarized in Table 4.4 on the following page. After initial losses, NCZ
made profits during 1976-1980. However, since 1981, problems associated
with the NCZ II plant started to take their toll on NCZ with heavy debt
burden, high fixed costs and low capacity utilization. Since then, NCZ has
been incurring heavy losses and as a result has not been able to meet its
debt obligations. For example, in 1982/83 the losses amounted to x 15.7
million (US$17 million) and increased to K 22.7 million (US$18 million) in
1983/84 and K 30.2 million (US$16 million) during 1984/85. The outstanding
debt as of end 1970/71 was K 12.5 million (US$17.5 million) and increased
to K 44.9 million (US$56.6 million) in 1976/77, K 243.2 million (US$300.6
million) in 1979/80 and amounted to K 127.1 million (US$53 million) as of
March 31, 1985.

4.18      The GRZ made an initial equity contribution of K 10 million
(US$14 million) in 1970 which has increased overtime, to K 175.4 million
(US$73 million) as of March 31, 1985. Total NCZ investment as of March 31,
1984 amounted to K 347 million (US$419 million) consisting of K 25 million
(US$35 million) in the NCZ I plant, K 291 million (US$350 million) in the
NCZ II plant and K 31 million (US$34 million) in the sulfuric acid plant.
With construction of the NCZ II plant, the capital structure of the company
became unsatisfactory, due to heavy debt burden and the resulting large
finance charges. The debt/equity ratio reached as high as 93:07 in some
years (Annex 4-3). Recoganzing this problem, tne GRZ took over, in 1982,
all of NCZ's foreign loans amounting to US$195 million (K 172.6 million
equivalent), converting US$78 million (K 68.9 million) into equity and
relieving NCZ of responsibility for the remaining US$117 million (K 103.7
million), reflecting part of the NCZ II plant cost overruns resulting from
detays and other factors which were  beyond the control of NCZ.  In
ad'dition, NPK intermediates received under the United States Agency for
Internationa' Development (USAID) program have been passed on to NCZ as
equity by the GiZ   Equity contribution made under this program amounted to
UZ$3 million during 1981 and US$14 million in 1982 and 1984.
4.19      The above measures, however, have not been adequate mainly due to
the continuing poor performance of the NCZ facilities, and NCZ's financial
condition has further deteriorated reaching a crisis level in 1985. While
in the past the GRZ and NCZ have taken some ad hoc measures, more needed to
be done. Under the Project, comprehensive measures have been taken to
reduce costs (e.g. staff reduction) and restructure NCZ's finances
including rescheduling and conversion into preferred equity of existing
debt, passing on of new OECF funds as equity and adoption of a CIF landed
cost-based ex-factory pricing formula for NCZTs products. It is expected
that with these measures and the implementation of the Project, NCZ will be
able to recover its financial viability (para 5.15).

V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Justification
5.01      NCZ, as the sole producer of fertilizer and explosive materials,
has an important role in Zambia's agriculture and mining sectors,
particularly further enhanced in the context of Zambia's difficult foreign
exchange position. The Project, aiming to improve Zambia's fertilizer
production efficiency to import competitive levels is, therefore, an
important element in Zambia's efforts to diversify its economy and
stimulate its agriculture to become the leading economic sector necessary
to reduce Zambia's dependence on mineral exports and imported food. The
Project will also be the first industrial restructuring program implemented
within the framework of the recommendations set forth by the recently
completed industrial sector report (para 2.10). Within a strategy of
industrial development in which greater attention is paid to the linkages
between industry and agriculture, the Project addresses a major concern of
the report, namely that of improving the performance of large-scale,
capital intensive public investments.
5.02      IDA's involvement in the Project is pa.ticularly important
because of the highly technical, complex and multi-sectoral nature of the
restructuring and lack of needed skills in Zambia to structure, supervise
and manage the Project. With its involvement in many sectors of Zambia's
economy, IDA is well placed to assist in the coordination of needed reforms
with different agencies of the Zambian Government. The Project is part of
the Bank's lending strategy of emphasizing agricultural development,
rehabilitating viable existing industries and diversifying the economy and
lessening dependence on imports and the mining sector. The Project is
technically sound and economically viable. As seen from the economic
analysis (Chapter VIII), the ERR of NCZ's operations after the Project is
implemented is estimated at 26.8Z and net present value at US$50.1
million. The Project itself will have a higher EER of 30Z (para 8.05).
The Project is expected to save on average about US$29 million in foreign
exchange annually for Zambia through reduced imports of fertilizers (Para
8.07).
B.   Project Objectives
5.03      The major objective of the Project is to assist the Zambian
Government to rehabilitate physically the NCZ facilities and to improve the
overall management and corporate performance of NCZ to provide Zambia with
the much needed fertilizers at minimum foreign exchange outflow and
comparable import prices. IDA's specific objectives are to assist in (i)
restructuring NCZ's management, organization and staffing pattern; (ii)
restructuring NCZ's finances; (iii) introducing modern management
techniques for plant operation; (v) upgrading the skills of the NCZ staff,
(vi) ensuring an integrated and efficient technical rehabilitation of the
physical facilities; and (vii) improving the raw material acquisition and
final product offtake logistics system.



- 25 -
C.  Project Description
5.04      The Project consists of two major components, namely, (a) policy
and institutional improvement, and (b) physical support, which include the
following subcomponents:
(a) Policy and Institutional Improvement Component involves the
following main measures/actions: {i) managerial restructuring;
(ii) provision of operations management services; (iii)
organizational restructuring; (iv) staff training; (v) provision
of technical coordination services; (vi) development of a cost
reduction program; (vii) evolution of an import competitive
ex-factory pricing system  (viii) financial restructuring of NCZ;
and (ix) restructuring of the logistics system.
(b)  .hysical Support Component consists of technical rehabilitation
of the: (i) NCZ I plant, (ii) NCZ II plant, and (iii) off-site,
infrastructure and environmental facilities.
Policy and Institutional Improvement Component
(i) Managerial Restructuring
5.05      To provide NCZ with a strong and dynamic management and the
requisite autonomy, the following measures have been taken: (i) NCZ -
which is the largest and most complex industrial investment in Zambia has
been transferred (in April 1985) from INDECO and made a direct subsidiary
of ZIMCO. As a result, the Company is expected to have (a) improved
management autonomy, authority and accountability; (b) more flexibility on
salary, procurement, pricing and other institutional matters; and (c)
appropriate hierachical level to be effective in working with other ZIMCO
Group companies, e.g., MCL, ZR, Zambia Electricity Supply Co., etc., which
are critical to NCZ's operations; (ii) experienced expatriates have been
appointed NCZ's full-time Managing Director (with a seat on the Board) and
General Manager; (iii) an experienced Internal Auditor, who will report
directly to the Managing Director, has been appointed to assist the senior
management in monitoring the compliance with company policies and
procedures including financial standards and practices; (iv) the NCZ Board
has been restructured, to provide a stronger private sector participation
of industrial/commercial experience necessary to give it a more direct
commercial orientation; and (iv) the corporate responsibilities have been
hierarchically restructured with the NCZ Board responsible for policy-
making, the Managing Director for overall management of the Company and tihe
General Manager for day-to-day operations. Assurances have been obtained
that the GRZ/ZIMCO will retain NCZ as a direct subsidiary of ZIMCO and
appoint (and retain) to the positions of Board Chairman (and other
members), Managing Director, General Manager, Finance Manager and Internal
Auditor of NCZ only persons with experience and qualifications satisfactory
to IDA.
(ii) Operatiors Management Services
5.06      Technical rehabilitation of NCZ facilities under the Project is
particularly complex, because of the sophisticated, although commercially



- 26 -
proven technology involved. Only a very limited number of coal-based
ammonia plants are successfully in operation in the world today. In most
cases, capacity utilization of these plants is still low, due to several
factors, which include poor operational practices, inadequate maintenance
skills, lack of carefully planned preventive maintenance, improper
selection of materials/equipment, and inadequate use/replacement of
chemicals and catalysts. In many of these plants abnormal requirement of
spare parts often does not derive from technological shortcomings but
rather results from the above problems. The Bank is involved in the
technical rehabilitation of coal-based ammonia plants in other countries
under the Turkey Fertilizer Rationalization and Energy Savings Project
(Loan 2131-TU), Madhya Pradesh Fertilizer Project (Loan 2415-IN) and China
Fertilizer Industry Rationalization Project (Loan 2541-CHA), and has a
broad expertise in this field. Experience has also shown that
rehabilitation work for such plants is complex and there is need for
further tuning up to varying extents when rehabilitation work is
completed. In the case of NCZ's plant also, it is reasonable to expec;t
that when technical modifications have been completed by respective
contractors, further adjustments will still be needed in the early stages
of operations. For this purpose, NCZ will require adequate operational
management and staff who can respond in time to any unforeseen process
imbalance and/or technological constraints in the initial years of
operations, to ensure the success of the Project.
5.07      Experience has also shown that infusion of professional expertise
has only limited success if obtained as individually-recruited staff,
especially in developing countries where generally sound operating and
maintenance systems and procedures do not exist. In such circumstances,
expertise of technical advisors tend to be subutilized, and it has been
difficult to forge individuals into a well-integrated managerial team. To
ensure the success of NCZ restructuring, it is therefore necessary to hire
an operations management team of experienced high-level staff from an
internationally reputable fertilizer producing company and assign it total
responsibility. Such an arrangement will also: (i) permit transfer of
proven and reliable systems/procedures of a well established firm and
infusion of efficiency-oriented attitudes and industrial culture into local
staff; (ii) make available a broad range of specialized back-up assistance,
as and when needed, with minimum delays; and (iii) assist in arranging
training of the NCZ staff, as required, outside Zambia. Such a team of
experts will also have a positive commitment to the success of the Project,
motivated mainly by the desire to maintain the firm's reputation.
5.08      Therefore, under the Project an experienced Operacions Management
Firm (OMF) has been hired, following IDA guidelines, to assist NCZ in its
operations under a management contract from October 1985 to December 1989
to (i) operate the plant efficiently; (ii) conduct a comprehensive review
of NCZ's organizational structure and staffing pattern, and recommend and
implement changes; (iii) coordinate and supervise the technical
rehabilitation; (iv) introduce modern management techniques, operational
and maintenance procedures and financial and management information system,
including computerization of major activities; and (v) upgrade the skills
of the NCZ staff through on-the-job and formal training to enable them to



- 27 -
operate the company efficiently after the OMF's departure. The OMF will
provide the General Manager, Technical Coordinator, Production Manager,
Maintenance Manager, Technical Manager, Personnel and Administrative
Manager and some 12 other middle-level managers (423 man-months). The firm
will be delegated full authority to manage the plant and will be
responsible to the NCZ Managing Director. Each OMF personnel will have a
counterpart from NCZ. The OMF will train the NCZ staff. The NCZ staff
will take over responsibility from the OMF personnel in a phased manner.
The OMF contract will be subject to annual performance review by NCZ.
Based on such reviews, NCZ will take, in consultation with IDA, appropriate
measures including adjustments in manpower and contract termination in case
of unsatisfactory performance by the OMF. The Ter-s _f Reference for the
OMF are given in Annex 5-1 and the proposed manprwer to be supplied in
Attachment I of that annex.
(iii) Organizational Restructuring
5.09      The OMF will carry out, by March 31, 1986, an Organizational
Restructuring Study of NCZ's current organizational structure to: (i)
identify current constraints and recommend proper restructuring of
organizational arrangements, operational procedures, inter-divisional
relationships, reporting system, management autonomy and development of
criteria for evaluation of management performance. Job evaluation analysis
would be reviewed and updated as required; (ii) identify reduction of
current overstaffing to optimal levels to operate the plant after
rehabilitation, and recommend, through analysis of salary/wage structure,
proper productivity-related incentive systems for expatriates (excluding
the OMF staff) and local staff, taking into account the sophisticated
technological skills required to operate such a plant; (iii) develop and
set-up an accounting, auditing, budgeting, financial planning and control
system; and (iv) identify areas suitable for computerization (such as
accounting system, payroll, cost control, inventories, warehouse,
maintenance, etc.). The Study will recommend an action plan to implement
the above. NCZ management with the help of the OMF, and in consultation
with IDA, will implement the action plan. Assurances have been obtained
that NCZ will not make any major changes in its organization without prior
consultation with IDA. Progress in implementing the action plan will be
reviewed at the time of interim review scheduled for March 1987 (para
5.21).
(iv) Staff Training
5.10      The Project includes provision for a comprehensive training
program for the NCZ staff to equip them with necessary skills required to
operate the plant efficiently. This program will include formal
(classroom) and informal (on-the-job) training both within Zambia (in and
outside NCZ) as well as outside Zambia. Such training will focus mainly on
operational practices in fertilizer plants and on improving the skills of
NCZ maintenance operators, particularly in maintaining rotating machines,
instrumentation, etc. The proposed IDA Credit includes provisions (80
man-months) to train abroad selected high and middle-level staff in



- 28 -
technical, financial and managerial aspects. The training program will be
designed by the OMF, by June 1986, based on the training needs emerging
from the Organizational Restructuring Study and will be reviewed by NCZ, in
consultation with IDA, before implementatior.. Based on the findings of
this study the Training Superintendent of the OMF will reorganize all
training activities of NCZ including (i) implementing the training-related
recommendations of the study by organizing a comprehensive training program
for the NCZ staff; (ii) restructuring of NCZ's training center (developing -
courses, seminars and proper balance between on-the-job and formal training
etc. for each field/speciality); (iii) establishing linkages between NCZ
and other industrial entities and universities in Zambia for training
purposes; (iv) determining a program fo- and monitoring training under the
OECF and FRG components of the Project ensuring its integration with the
IDA financed training; and (v) periodically monitoring overall improvement
in operational and managerial skills of NCZ personnel as a result of OMF
assistance and other training programs (3ECF, FRG) and propose corrective
actions as required. Trained personnel will be expected to stay with the
company for a minimum period of time. The training program envisaged under
the Project is expected to upgrade the skills of NCZ personnel enabling
them to operate the facilities efficiently after the departure of the OMF.
The progress and achievements of the training program will be periodically
monitored by NCZ.
(v) Technical Coordination Services
5.11      In view of the complexity of the Project, involving
implementation by two different contractors of plant modifications on two
coal-based fertilizer plants, which are inter-linked at different process
stages, and improvements in the utilities and environmental systems of the
complex, the OMF team includes a Technical Coordinator for a period of
three years beginning June 1985, to supervise and coordinate implementation
of the overall rehabilitation work. Two NCZ engineers have been assigned
on a full time basis to assist the Technical Coordinator in the above
task. The Technical Coordinator, who will report to the General Manager,
will be the Owner's Engineer with full responsibility and authority for
coordinating the work of both contractors as well as their respective
Technical Advisors. Draft Terms of Reference for the Technical Coordinator
are given in Annex 5-1, Attachment 2.
(vi) Cost Reduction Program
5.12      Through various policy, managerial, institutional, technical and
financial measures, the Project is expected to reduce NCZ's fertilizer
production costs by over 30% thus bringing them to levels competitive
with imports. A major part of the cost reductions would come from the
technical rehabilitation of the facilities enabling the plant to operate at
higher levels of capacity and at reduced rates of input consumption. In
addition, a detailed analysis of the current budgeting and cost control
system (including detailed cost reduction recommendations) will be carried
out under the OMF's Organizational Restructuring Study. However, as a
first step, NCZ is now implementing an Emergency Action Plan to reduce its
operating costs, particularly labor and administrative costs, focusing
especially on reduction of staff strength, overtime, staff absenteeism,



-  29 -
etc. Staff strength has been reduced from 1,584 to 1,270 and further
reductions are expected over the next few months. Measures to reduce other
fixed and variable costs such as reduction in raw material and finished
product inventories, review of insurance policies, reduction of accounts
receivable, execution of an energy audit of plant operations to reduce
energy consumptions, etc. are also being taken. Assurances have been
obtained that NCZ's total staff strength will be no more than 1,100 by erd
1986. Each year, by December 31, NCZ will submit to IDA for its rc-vir-. and
approval, a detailed action plan on cost reduction measures.
(vii) Internationally Competitive Ex-Factory Pricing System
5.13      To maintain its economic viability, NCZ will set the ex-factory
price of fertilizers equivalent to CIF landed cost, suitably smoothened
against short term international price fluctuations. Such price formula
will be based on a three-year rolling average; past and current years and
may also include forecast of the upcoming year. Details of how the prices
will be set according to this formula have been discussed at negotiations
and agreements reached. The GRZ has confirmed that NCZ has autonomy for
determining the economic price of its output and does not need GRZ
approval. Actual implementation of the formula will be reviewed at the
time of interim review scheduled for March 1987 (para 5.21).
(viii) Financial Restructuring
5.14      The Project includes restructuring of NCZ's finances involving
the following measures: (i) conversion by the GRZ into equity of OECF loan
(K 14.7 million) given for the sulfuric acid plant and NPK intermediates (K
48 million) obtained under the USAID program); (ii) passing on to NCZ as
equity the OECF loan of US$26.7 million being provided for NCZ I
rehabilitation; (iii) rescheduling of all commercial bank loans (K 41.1
million) with a three-year moratorium on principal and one year on interest
payments; (iv) conversion into preferred equity of other loans (K 57.8
million) held by Zambian financial institutions carrying 12% p.a.
cumulative dividends with a five-year moratorium on dividend payment and
shares to be redeemed during 1992/93-1994/95; (v) a 15% increase in the
ex-factory price of fertilizers effective May 1985, 85% increase effective
January 1986 (as a result of devaluation) and pricing based on economic
prices (CIF landed cost equivalent) from April 1986; and (vii) NCZ to bring
its accounts receivable, accounts payable and over-drat. to normal levels
during 1986/87, and to introduce a system of discounts and penalties to
encourage timely payment of accounts.
5.15      These measures have been agreed to by all concerned parties.  As
discussed in Chapter VII and shown in Table 7.1 on page 41, these measures
along with other improvements contemplated under the Project are expected
to restore financial viability of the Company, enabling it to cover all its
expenses, service its debt and earn a reasonable return on its capital.
5.16      Foreign Exchange Availability.  The GRZ has introduced an open
auction system for the allocation of foreign exchange in the country. NCZ



- 30 -
has equal access to purchase needed foreign exchange resources under the
auction system. In addition, given the economic importance of NCZ's
operations to the agriculture and mining sectors, the GRZ and BOZ have
recognized that adequate provision of foreign exchange (including import
licenses) is necessary to meet NCZ's operational and intermediate material
needs to achieve optimum production levels. After rehabilitation, NCZ's
foreign exchange requirements are estimated to be about US$6 million for
plant operations (spare parts and chemicals and catalysts) and about US$16.
million annually (both in 1984 constant dollars) for the import of NPK
intermediates. However, if phosphate and potash intermediates are not
imported, because of the lack of foreign exchange, NCZ could still operate
its facilities at about 80Z of the rated nitrogen output producing AN and
AS only.
(ix) Restructuring of the Logistics System
5.17      An Inter-Agency Fertilizer Coordination Committee has been
established (in December 1984) to ensure full operational coordination
among NCZ, MCL, ZR, TAZARA Railways and NAMBOARD to coordinate timely coal
delivery in quantities and qualities required by NCZ as well as timely
offtake of NCZ output.  This Committee, set up based on the Terms of
Reference given in Annex 5-2, has, inter-alia, developed contracts between
NCZ, MCL, ZR and NAMBOARD. Terms of the contracts include a quality-linked
coal price formula and responsibilities for transportation losses, payment
of accounts, delivery schedules, etc. The Committee will also deal with
the problems related to the transportation of fertilizers to improve
efficiency and reduce losses and costs.
Physical Support Component
i) Technical Rehabilitation of the NCZ I Plant
5.18      Under the contract signed in March 1984, a Japanese contractor,
who originally built the plant, has been engaged with OECF financing, to
vi) design and engineer; (ii) procure, inspect and deliver new equipment
and materials; (iii) replace, repair and overhaul existing equipment as
needed; and (iv) supervise start-up of operations for the NCZ I plant. As
mentioned earlier (para 4.12), the NCZ I plant which has been in operation
for 15 years and has remained inadequately maintained, does not need major
debottlenecking or modification. Rather it needs replacement and
overhauling of obsolete equipment and materials, in particular, inner
linings of the gasifier, heat exchangers, piping, pumps, insulation,
instrumentation and electrical systems. Most of the rehabilitation work
will concern the ammonLia unit, but some modifications will also be carried
out in the nitric acid and AN units. After rehabilitation, the ammonia
plant will reach its achievable capacity of 83 tpd of NH3 and the
downstream units will become capable of processing the above level of
ammonia production. The contract includes revamping of the fertilizer
complex water treatment plant. In addition, pollution abatement system for
the NCZ I nitric acid unit to reduce the nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission
levels from the current over 2,000 parts per million (ppm) to the
international acceptable level of 500 ppm will be installed latest by
December 31, 1987 (para 5.32).

(ii) Technical Rehabilitation of the NCZ II Plant
5.i9      Rehabilitation of the NCZ II plant, to be carried out under FRG
financing, by a German contractor, who originally built the expansion
plant, will restore the original design capacity through:  (i) repairs and
improvements to the cooling water, steam condensate and power supply
systems; (ii) revamping of instrument air system and debottlenecking of
nitrogen system; (iii) revamping of coal storage and handling section,
revamping of gasification section, modifications to electrostatic
precipitators, revamping of water scrubbing system, replacement of heat
exchangers in the rectisol unit and debottlenecking of the liquid nitrogen
wash unit; (iv) revamping of the carbon monoxide (CO) conversion unit
including replacement of catalyst; (v) revamping of the ammonia synthesis
unit including replacement of the refrigeration ammonia condensers,
replacement of catalyst and modification of reactor internals; (vi)
connecting the rectisol unit to the sulfuric acid plant to mix the sulfur
containing off-gases from the rectisol unit with the roast gases; and (vii)
revamping of the air separation unit. Limitetd modifications will also be
carried out to the nitric acid and AN units. In addition, pollution
control equipment will be installed to bring down the NOx emission levels
of the nitric acid plant from a current level of 1,200 ppm to 500 ppm (para
5.32). Signing of a satisfactory contract for the rehabilitation of NCZ II
plant is a condition of Credit effectiveness.
Ciii) Rehabilitation of Off-site and Infrastructure Facilities
5.20      To complement the above plant modifications, NCZ is carrying out
improvements to the off-sites, utilities, infrastructure and environmental
systems of the complex. These improvements include (i) a new coal-fired
boiler to balance the steam system; (ii) a closed loop system at the AN
unit of the NCZ II plant to recover accidental discharge of AN solution;
Ciii)rehabilitation of the water treatment plant; (iv) additional vehicles
for internal handling of materials; tv) rehabilitation of workshop
facilities; (vi) upgrading of laboratory facilities; and (vii)
computerization of major activities. In addition, the OMF will conduct, by
September 1986, an Environmental Study including review of the solid waste
and liquid effluent disposal systr-m, an Energy Audit Study and a full
Safety Study of NCZ operations to identify energy conservation potential
and possible environmental/health hazards from NCZ operations and the
measures needed to minimize their impact on the environment and safety.
Recommendations of these studies will be implemented by NCZ in consultation
with IDA.
D.  Project Management and I-mplementation Arrangements
5.21      NCZ will have primcry responsibility for Project management.
Technical rehabilitation of the NCZ I and NCZ II plants will be the
turn-key responsibility, respectively, of the Japanese and German
contractors. NCZ, through the OMF's Technical Coordinator, will cocrdinate
and supervise the technical rehabilitation, assisted by the Technical
Advisors appointed under the OECF and FRG components to monitor the
technical work of NCZ I and NCZ II plants, respectively. The remaining
engineering, procurement and installation work will be carried out by NCZ,
under the direct supervision of the Technical Coordinator. A Project



- 32 -
Steering Committee has been established, consisting of the Chairman of NCZ
Board, Managing Director of NCZ, Financial Director of ZINCO, and the
Permanent Secretary of MOF, to facilitate processing of the policy and
finance related measures and to oversee overall Project implementation.
(Terms of Reference for the Project Steering Committee are available in
Project File.) An interim review will be undertaken with the GRZ and
co-lenders in March 1987 to assess the progress on major issues , e.g.
organizational restructuring, cost reduction (including staff reduction),
ex-factory pricing, foreign exchange, etc..
E. Project Implementation Schedule
5.22      NCZ I plant rehabilitation is already under way and is expected
to be completed by July 1986. Installation of the new boiler and AN
recovery system is expected to be completed by March 1986. NCZ II plant
rehabilitation is expected to start in March 1986 and to be completed by
December 1987. Thus, the technical integrity of the plants will be
restored by December 1987. The OMF has started work in October 1985 for a
period of 51 months; the Technical Coordinator has joined NCZ in June i985,
and the other OMF personnel have followed beginning October 1985. A
detail-- Project implementation schedule is given in Annex 5-3.
F. Raw Materials, Utilities and Infrastructure
1. Raw Materials
5.23      NCZ's requirements of main raw materials and intermediates and
their sources of supply are given below.
Table 5.1 NCZ - ANNUAL RAW MATERIAL AND INTERMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS
(tpy, at 85% capacity utilization)
Materials               Local       Import       Source

Coating Agents                 -          1,200
5.24      Coal Supply.  About 191,800 tpy of coal required by NCZ as
feedstock for ammonia production, will be provided by the Maamba Collieries
Ltd. (MCL), a fully-owned subsidiary of ZIMCO. Coal occurs in Zambia in
the mid-Zambian basin, west of Kariba Lake, in the Luangwa Valley (Northern
Province) and in the western basin (Western Province). The best known in
the mid-Zambian basin has proven reserves estimated at about 250 million
tons, and sustains the only coal mine in the country, operated by MCL.



- 33 -
Coal reserves are more than adequate to meet NCZ's requirements during the
economic life of the Project. The mine, opened in 1966, is located about
250 km southeast of Kafue and includes a coal washing plant and an aerial
ropeway to the nearest railhead at Masuku. Originally designed to deliver
1.2 million tpy of saleable coal, the mine has been producing between
450,000 and 600,OOC tpy for the last five years because of technical and
managerial constraiats. Due to low capacity utilization and the GRZ
pricing policies setting coal prices at levels which do not cover
production costs, MCI has experienced considerable financial problems.
5.25      A number of steps have been taken to rehabilitate MCL.  An
engineering study completed recently under the Maamba Coal Engineering
Project (Credit 1333-ZA), has reviewed MCL's operational performance,
analyzed its technological, marketing, economic, financial and managerial
constraints and prepared a feasibility report for the rehabilitation of the
mine complex. This study has confirmed the economic viability of MCL after
rehabilitation is complete. The African Development Bank (AFDB) has
provided a loan of US$28 million to finance equipment and materials needed
for the rehabilitation as well as limited technical assistance to improve
technical operations at the mine. In the meantime, a new management team
has been installed at MCL. A more flexible pricing policy has been
adopted, under which the coal price will fully cover MCL's production costs
and reasonable profit based on a formula recommended by the above-mentioned
engineering study. Along with the technical rehabilitation of the complex,
these measures are expected to restore MCL's profitability while allowing
coal prices to be competitive with imports from Zimbabwe or South Africa.
5.26      Nonetheless, full rehabilitation of MCL operations will not be
complete before 1988, and until then MCL's coal supply could fall short of
NCZ's needs. Gaps, if any, cou-ld be filled, however, by importing coal
from Zimbabwe; (in 1984, NCZ imported about 10,000 tons of coal from
Zimbabwe to supplement coal supplied by MCL). Since Zimbabwe coal is
currently of better quality and can be imported at about equivalent to MCL
price, use of imported coal, if needed, is not expected to affect the
economic viability of NCZ operations. Moreover, past shortages of coal
were often the result of poor coordination among MCL, ZR and NCZ, rather
than due to physical shortages of coal at MCL mine. The recently
established Inter-Agency Coordination Committee should improve on the
coordination effort (para 5.17). The GRZ has assured that it will take all
measures needed to ensure adequate supply of coal to NCZ.
5.27      Coal Transport.  NCZ's coal requirements are transported from MCL
by Zambia Railways (ZR), a fully-owned subsidiary of ZIMCO. ZR facilities
and equipment are generally adequate for the estimated traffic, bit not
satisfactorily utilized. At present, the turnaround time is long and the
locomotives on-line time is short. In the past, poor wagon and locomotive
utilization practices have affected timely delivery of coal and NCZ
therefore had to resort to expensive road transportation. In addition,
lack of coordination among MCL, ZR and NCZ resulted in inadequate planning
and scheduling arrangements for coal shipments from the mines. These
problems are now being addressed through a number of measures which will be
taken under the Fourth Railway Project (Credit 1575-ZA) to improve



- 34 -
operational capabilities of ZR. These measures include improvement in
managerial and organizational capabilities of ZR and provision of spare
.parts to improve the effective availability of locomotives and wagons.
Communication systems are also being upgraded. As a result of these
measures, by the time NCZ facilities are fully rehabilitated, ZR's capacity
and ability to move the necessary amounts of NCZ's inputs and outputs
should be adequate. The GRZ has assured that it will take all measures to
ensure timely transport of coal to NCZ.
5.28      Pyrites.  About 35,100 tpy of pyrites required by NCZ for
sulfuric acid production (and consequently ammonium sulfate, an
intermediate for NPK compounds) will be supplied by Nampundwe mine; the
latter was originally operated as the King Edward mine in 1913 and 1914 and
reopened in 1970, as a ZOCM subsidiary, to exploit pyrites which are
concentrated for industrial use. The mine was expanded in 1982, with a
design capacity of 350,000 tpy of pyrites ore at 15% sulfur content which
is upgraded in a beneficiation plant to produce 90,000 tpy pyrites
concentrate with 42Z sulfur content. However, due to bottlenecks in mining
operations, its maximum output has not exceeded 250,000 tpy of ore
corresponding to 65,000 tpy of pyrites concentrate. This capacity
nevertheless is adequate as NCZ's needs are only about 35,100 tpy and the
balance meets the needs (25-30,000 tpy) of the only other customer--ZCCM.
Efforts to debottleneck mining operations, in particular to expand the
capacity of the compressed air system, are under way. In 1984, NCZ
experienced some pyrites supply problems but after planned improvements at
the Nampundwe Mines are completed (by 1986) NCZ's pyrite needs are expected
to be met fully. Total pyrite ore reserves amounting to 23 million tonnes
are more than adequate to meet NCZ's pyrite needs during its economic
life. Additional pyrite deposits have recently been discovered and
evaluated at Nyimba in the Eastern Province, and some other small
occurrences are reported in other locations (see IBRD Map No. 18861). The
GRZ has assured that it will take all measures to ensure adequate supply of
pyrites to NCZ.
5.29      Lime. NCZ's lime needs of 7,200 tpy, required in coal
gasification and sulfuric acid production, are met by Crushed Stone Ltd.,
an INDEC0 subsidiary located in the outskirts of Lusaka, and by Ndola Lime,
a private company located in Ndola. Limestone deposits are spread all over
the country and are suitable for cement, agriculture, and chemical use. No
problems of lime supply have been experienced in the past or are foreseen
in the future.
5.30      NPK Intermediates.  NCZ will import NPK intermediates, about
55,900 tpy worth US$16 million (in 1984 constant dollars), which are granu-
lated with liquid AN and AS to produce NPK compounds. In the past, NCZ has
experienced shortages of these intermediates, due to the lack of foreign
exchange and inadequate procurement arrangements, especially when supplied
under bilateral aid. To mitigate such risk, NCZ was forced to keep
excessive inventories (up to 18 months) incurring storage and inventory
carrying costs. Under the Project, more efficient procurement procedures
will be introduced for NPK intermediates. Improved availability of foreig-a
exchange should also help NCZ in obtaining timely (and at competitive
prices) supply of these materials (para 5.16). However, if because of



-35 
foreign exchange problems, NPK intermediates are not imported, NCZ could
still operate its facilities at about 802 of the rated nitrogen output
producing AN and AS only; compound fertilizers will then not be produced.
2.   Utilities and Infrastructure
5.31      NCZ's power supply needs are met by the Zambia Electricity Supply
Company, and fuel oil requirements by the Indeni refinery. Under the
Project, other NCZ infrastructure facilities, such as workshops, materials
handling equipment, boilers, laboratories, etc. will be rehabilitated.
After rehabilitation the present utilities, power, water supply systems and
other infrastructure facilities at NCZ will be adequate to meet its needs.
G. Environmental and Safety Aspects
5.32      Presently, the NCZ fertilizer complex has a severe pollution
problem caused by nitrogen oxide gaseous emissions from the NCZ I and NCZ
1I nitric acid plants. The current level (up to 2,200 ppm) of such
emissions is 6-10 times the maximum levels presently permitted in most
industrialized countries. Such high levels are partly due to the higher
levels permitted when these plants were designed and partly due to the
deterioration of the facilities. This high level of emissions affects
adversely the environment and the acid rains generated from NOx gases
corrode the plant facilities. Under the Project, both NCZ I and NCZ II
plants would be equipped with NOx abatement units to reduce contaminant in
stack gases to a maximum of 500 ppm, the present international standard
(paras 5.18 & 5.19).
5.33      Solid waste and part of the liquid effluents from the plant are
sent to two disposal ponds. The remaining liquid effluents are neutralized
in a water treatment plant before discharging into the Kafue Township
sewage system. Under the Project, NCZ will rehabilitate the water
treatment plant, install a closed loop system at the AN unit of NCZ II
plant, and take other necessary measures to prevent pollution. After
Project implementation, the liquid effluents will meet international
standards. Under the Environmental Study to be carried out by the OMF, by
September 1986, all aspects related to solid waste and liquid effluent
disposal will be reviewed in detail and recommended measures will be
implemented. In addition, the proposed Safety Study will recommend steps
to be taken to deal with any potential safety hazards at NCZ (para 5.20).
Assurances have been obtained that NCZ will rehabilitate and operate its
facilities under environmental and safety standards satisfactory to IDA.

1986 onwards.
The base cost estimates are in December 1985 prices. Physical
contingencies are calculated at 10% of the base cost estimate for equipment
under IDA and NCZ components. Price escalation for equipment under IDA
component is based on expected international annual inflation rates of
7.2% in 1986, 6.8% in 1987-88, and 7.0% in 1989. Price escalation of 7%
p.a. (based on the proposed contract terms) has been usee for IDA financed
technical assistance services. For OECF and FRG financed components actual
physical and price contingency estimates given in respective contractor
proposals have been used. The Project includes about US$6.3 million lZor
some 580 man-months of foreign consultancy services for (i) technical
advisory services under FRG and OECF components; and (ii) operations
management services (423 man-months) and Internal Auditor (24 man-months)
under the IDA component.

B.   Project Financing Plan
6.02      The overall Project financing requirement of US$83.75 million
equivalent is proposed to be financed by IDA, OECF, FRG and NCZ. IECF has
approved a loan of US$26.68 million (Yen 6,343 million) to cover the
foreign exchange cost of NCZ I rehabilitation. To meet the foreign
exchange cost of NCZ II rehabilitation, FRG has approved a loan of US$27.20
million (DM 68 million). An IDA Credit of US$10 million equivalent is
recommended to meet the foreign exchange cost of the technical assistance
and off-site and infrastructure facilities rehabilitation. The remaining
US$4.03 million of foreign exchange cost and US$15.84 million of local cost
will be financed by NCZ from internal funds. NCZ is capable of meeting its
financing requirements following the financial restructuring (para 5.14).
Nevertheless, the GRZ has assured that it would provide the necessary funds
to NCZ should there be any financing gap. Details on the financing plan
are given in Table 6.2 below.

6.03      The proposed IDA Credit of US$10 million equivalent, which would
cover about 12% of the overall financing required, will be made directly to
the Government. The GRZ will onlend the funds to NC%, under a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, at an annual
interest rate of 9.7% p.a (IBRD rate of 8.82% plus a 10% premium) with a
maturity of i5 years including 5 years of grace. NCZ will bear the foreign
exchange risk. The OECF loan has been made to the GRZ at an interest rate
of 3.5% p.a. with a maturity of 30 years including 10 years of grace. The
GRZ has passe': on these funds to NCA as equity to strengthen NCZ's equity
base. The FRG Loan has been made to the GRZ at 2% p.a. interest rate wiLh
30 years maturity including 10 years of grace. The GRZ will relend FRG
funds to NCZ at an interest rate of 10% with a maturity of 15 years
including 5 years of grace; NCZ will bear the foreign exchange risk. The
Project was appraised simultaneously by IDA and FRG. OECF's appraisal

6.05      Procurement Arrangements for IDA Financing.  Consultants for the
Operations Management Services have been contracted in accordance with IDA
guidelines (para 5.08). Procurement of foreign goods and services will be
carried out by NCZ under the supervision of the Technical Coordinator. IDA
will finance equipment and materials for workshops, internal handling,
off-sites, environmental systemlE laboratories and computer facilities and
chemicals and catalysts for planL. Equipment and materials totalling
US$4.2 million to be financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with
IDA puidelines through international competitive bidding (ICB) and limited
international tendering (LIT) except for (i) proprietary items which may be
procured through direct purchasing; and (ii) orders for small and
miscellaneous items under contracts with an estimated value of up to
US$100,000 each which may be procured through international shopping with
at least three price quotations from three IDA eligible countries. The
aggregate of such contracts under IDA Credit procured under the above
exception to ICB and LIT procedures, will not exceed US$600,000 equivalent
for direct purchasing and US$300,000 equivalent for international
shopping. All contracts for goods procured under ICB totalling about
US$2.40 million, will be subject to IDA'- prior review and approval; LIT
contracts will be subject to IDA's post-review.
6.06      To enable the Project to be implemented on schedule, IDA has
provided, under Project Preparation Facility (P319-ZA), up to US$250,000,
as an advance on a reimbursable basis, to finance eligible expenditures for
consultancy services incurred between the date of completion of appraisal
(November 1984) and the expected date of Credit effectiveness.

D. Allocation and Disbursement of IDA Credit
6.07      The proposed allocation of IDA Credit is given below.
Table 6.4   ALLOCATION OF IDA CREDIT
(US$ million)
Equipment &
Haterials         Technical Assistance       Training          Total
4.2                     5.3                  0.5            10.0
Disbursements will cover (i) 100% of expenditures for directly imported
goods and 80Z for locally procured imported goods; Cii) 100% of the cost of
consultants; and (iii) 10OZ of the training cost. Disbursements will be
made against full documentation except for reimbursements for training and
contracts valued at less than US$20,000 equivalent each wuich would be made
against Statement of Expenditures. A Revolving Fund in the amount of
US$150,000 will be set up to meet small expenditures for the purchase of
equipment and materials, and training.
6.08      The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA Credit
given in Annex 6-2 is based on expected disbursements and not on the
standard sectoral profiles. IDA's involvement in the Project is of a quite
different nature than regular Bank projects. IDA is financing only about
14Z of the total Project cost, primarily for technical assistance, while
the cost of physical facilities are being financed by cofinancing
agencies. Disbursements are expected to be faster than those based on
sectoral profiles, as a major portion of the IDA Credit will be used to
finance the technical assistance services, the contract for which has been
negotiated and the expected disbursements are based on the payment schedule
in the contract. IDA Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30,
1990. Closing Date for the Credit will be December 31, 1990.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Projections
7.01      Key assumptions used in the financial analysis are given in
Annex 7-1. Financial projections have been prepared in current Kwacha
terms. The projections are based on the exchange rate of K 6 - US$1
prevailing in January 1986. (For years 1984 and 1985 the actual prevailing
exchange rates of K 2.1 and K 3.1 - US$1 have been used). Expected
international inflation rates of 7.2% in 1986, 6.8% in 1987-88, 7% in 1989,
7.1% in 1990 and 4% thereafter have been used for foreign as well as
domestic costs and benefits, assuming that the difference between the
domestic and international inflation rates will be reflected in the
exchange rate adjustments.



- 40 -
7.02      Due to operational problems and existing stock of NPK compound
fertilizers in the country, during 1985 NCZ produced only AN and had to
shut down NPK plants resulting in low capacity utilization. However, the
demand for NPK compounds has picked up now and the operational problems are
also being resolved. The rehabilitated facilities are expected to operate
at 70% capacity (in terms of ammonia units) in the first year and achieve
the desired capacities in the second year of their operations (80% for the
NCZ I and 75% for NCZ II ammonia plants, corresponding to about 85% level
for the final products for both plants). These assumptions are realistic
considering that this is a rehabilitation Project and not a new plant
construction and that in the past NCZ I plant has operated at over 90%
capacity (for final products) for a number of years (para 4.12). After
rehabilitation, the NCZ II ammonia plant technically could operate at an
average capacity utilization of 80%. However, the ammonia unit of this
plant is oversized vis-a-vis the down stream units. Therefore, 75%
capacity utilization has been assumed to balance ammonia consumption
requirements.
7.03      The price levels of fixed costs (spare parts, chemicals and cata-
lysts, electricity, labor, insurance and administrative) will remain at
their January 1986 levels in real dollar terms, and are therefore projected
to increase in line with international inflation rates. The variable costs
for domestic items are assumed to remain constant in real dollar terms at
their January 1986 level; price levels for imported items are based on IBRD
commodity projections. For revenues, except for sulfuric and nitric acids
for which prices prevailing in January 1986 have been assumed to remain
constant Cin real dollar terms), the economic prices based on IBRD
commodity projections have been used (para 8.02). In principle, NCZ's
ex-factory prices of fertilizers will be equivalent to CIF landed cost; in
the past NCZ's ex-factory prices have been substantially higher than those
of imports (para 3.26). Detailed financial projections are presented in
Annexes 7-2 to 7-4 and stmmmarized in Table 7.1 on the following page.
7.04      As mentioned earlier, NCZ is facing serious financial problems.
It is in a very difficult financial situation. However, the Company iF
taking steps to reduce costs and improve collection of accounts which
should help it to meet its financial obligations during the next three
years while its facilities are being rehabilitated. Given new strong
management, implementation of cost reduction measures, CIF prices for its
output and devaluation of the kwacha, NCZ should be able to come out of its
financial problems successfully. After rehabilitation, financial
performance of NCZ is expected to improve significantly as a result of the
Project. The Company is expected to generate profits from 1986 onwards,
the first year of operation of the rehabilitated NCZ I plant as capacity
utilization increases and operating costs are reduced as a result of
improvements in operational and managerial efficiency. The net income
(after tax) is expected to increase from K 30.2 million (US$5 million) in
1987 to K 72 million (US$12 million) in 1988 and K 85 million (US$14
million) in 1995. The key financial ratios (current, debt service
coverage, profitability and debt/equity) are expected to remain at a
satisfactory levels during the Project life. Of course, realization of
these projections would depend on NCZ's capability to undertake the
necessary reforms envisaged under the Project. Since appraisal, NCZ has
demonstrated such capability.

Note: Sharp increase in revsuies and other variables in 1986 is prfzarily a result of

B. Financial Rate of Return
7.05      Financial analysis has been done for the entire NCZ complex (para
8.05). On this basis, the financial rate of return (FRR) at 26% and net
present value of US$46 million (at 12Z discounting factor), both before
tax, are satisfactory; on an after tax basis these figures will be 22.3%
and US$27.9 million, respectively (Annex 7-5). The FRR is more sensitive
to changes in the operating costs, capacity utilization, urea prices and



- 42 -
revenues. However, it is expected to remain satisfactory under reasonable
changes in these key parameters. Results of the sensitivity analysis and
switching values, i.e., percent value at which the net present value
becomes zero, are summarized below.

C. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.06      NCZ will submit to IDA annual financial reports, examined by
independent auditors acceptable to IDA, within six months of the end of its
financial year. These reports will include standard auditing requirements
for disbursements against the Statement of Expenditures as well as the
Revolving Fund Account. In addition, NCZ will submit quarterly financial
statements and Project progress and procurement status reports (including
minutes of the Project Steering and Inter-Agency Committees) within 60 days
of the end of each quarter. NCZ will also provide by February 15 of each
year, for annual review by IDA, its next two-year rolling production,
investment and financial plans, and preliminary statements for the current
fiscal year including budget variance analysis. Finally, within six months
of the closing date of the Credit, NCZ will prepare and furnish to IDA a
Project Completion Report on the Project implementation, and costs and
benefits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
D. Financial Covenants
7.07      Agreements have been reached with NCZ that it will: (i) set its
ex-factory prices of fertilizers in line with the CIF prices as explained
in para 5.13; (ii) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.1 during
1985/86-1987/88 and 1.4 thereafter; (iii) maintain a debt service coverage
ratio of not less than 1.3 beginning 1987/88; (iv) maintain a debt equity
ratio of not more than 60:40; (v) not declare any dividend on its
paid-in-capital during the implementation period of the Project; and (vi)
not undertake any major expansion program (above US$2 million annually)
without prior approval of IDA.

E. Major risks
7.08      The potential for technical risks in the Project is substantial
as it deals with the rehabilitation of complex existing plants, one of
which has never operated well in the past. These risks, as well as
possible delays in Project implementation, have been minimized by having
turn-key contracts with experienced engineering firms and adequate
performance guarantees. The risk of not attaining and maintaining a high
capacity utilization could derive mainly from organizational, managerial
and foreign exchange problems (for foreign exchange risk see para 7.10).
These risks have been minimized by (i) organizational and managerial
restructuring of the Company including the appointment of a full-time
experienced expatriate industrialist as Managing Director, restructuring of
NCZ Board to give it a commercial orientation and transferring of NCZ to
the ZIMCO Group to provide it with greater autonomy; (ii) the appointment
of aa experienced Operations Management Firm to ensure efficient operations
of NCZ facilities while introducing proper maintenance procedures, improved
financial and management information system, introduction of efficiency
attitudes and industrial operating cuiture, and proper training if Zambian
personnel to enable the local staff to operate the Company after the
departure of the OMF; and (iii) engaging the services of a Technical
Coordinator to supervise the technical work and to ensure full integration
and coordination at each stage of Project implementation.
7.09      The risk of shortages of feedstocks is being minimized through
planned improvements in MCL, ZR and Nampundwe mine. In addition, the
establishment of the Inter-Agency Committee and introduction of proper
scheduling and procurement procedures for domestic as well as imported
inputs should help minimize such risks.
7.10      The risk of foreign exchange not being available to cover NCZ's
operating requirements, thereby causing lower capacity utilization and
inadequate maintenance, is high. Zambia is facing a serious balance of
payments problem and the situation is not expected to improve significantly
in the near future. Therefore, this risk remains, although a more
organized dialogue between NCZ and BOZ has helped in creating a better
understanding of the problem and the heavy costs associated with it.
In this context, introduction of the auction system for the allocation of
foreign exchange in the country should allow NCZ to obtain the needed
foreign exchange.
7.11      Although currently there is an overstock of fertilizers in
Zambia, this situation is not expected to last long. Thus, in the long
run, no commercial risk is foreseen as the demana for fertilizers in Zambia
is expected to increasingly exceed NCZ production. The risk of inadequate
financial performance due to lower capacity utilization and uneconomic
prices of output has been minimized by: (i) institutional reforms and the
appointment of the OMF to operate the Company; (ii) a proper financial
restructuring package; (iii) cost reduction measures; and (iv) assurances
on ex-factory prices. However, if NCZ's ex-factory prices were to fall
below CIF landed cost substantially, or the prices of inputs were to exceed
their CIF equivalent significantly because of problems in other sectors
without concurrent increases in NCZ's ex-factory prices, it could have
serious impact on NCZ's financial condition. The risk of this however, is



- 44 -
low, as the GRZ is taking rehabilitation measures to improve the
operational efficiency of MCL, ZR, NAMBOARD and other related enterprises
and agencies and is moving towards a more competitive pricing environment.
In addition, NCZ in recent months has demonstrated capability to make
difficult decisions, such as staff reduction.
7.12      Overall, the country risk remains.  Zambia is facing serious
balance of payments problem. The country's management resources are
limited and the level of technical expertise is relatively low. There are
inherent difficulties in rehabilitation or turnarounds of parastatal
companies. The Project calls for many difficult decisions on the part of
the Government. So far the GRZ has shown willingness to face up to them.
However, the success of the Project would depend to a large extent on the
future ability of the Government, particularly of the political
authorities, to face up to reality in making those difficult decisions.
The interim review proposed for March 1987 should provide IDA an added
opportunity to pursue progress on these issues (para 5.21).
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01      Key assumptions used in the economic analysis are given in Annex
8-1. The economic life of the Project has been assumed to be 12 years with
no salvage value at the end. Csts and benefits are expressed in 1984 real
dollar terms. All economic costs and benefits for tradeable items have
been valued at international prices estimated to prevail during the
economic life of the Project. All non-tradeable items are valued at their
respective domestic prices, after applying specific conversion factors to
reflect the economic prices to Zambia. The factors used are: standard
conversion 0.96, raw materials 0.86, intermediate goods 0.95, electricity
0.97, transport 0.76, skilled labor 0.54, semiskilled labor 0.67 and
unskilled labor 0.85.
8.02      -evenues.  Economic prices for NCZ's output are given in Annex
8-1, Table 1. It has been assumed that in the absence of NCZ, Zambia would
continue to import ammonium nitrate until 1990 as farmers would take time
to adjust to change to other fertilizer products. Thereafter, part of
NCZ's output, namely fertilizer grade AN (about 72,900 tons), can be
substituted by more economic imported urea. The remainder of NCZ's output,
namely explosive grade AN (22,000 tons) and AN used to produce compound
fertilizers (25,900 tons) cannot be replaced with urea for technical
reasons. The economic price of AN fertilizer is based on (i) until 1990,
the equivalent landed price of imported ammonium nitrate at Kafue
(calculated in nutrient terms from FOB Europe price of urea and adding a
15% premium; historically, AN carries a premium of 15-20% over urea for
equivalent nitrogen content because of its use for some special crops and
preference by farmers); and (ii) after 1990, the equivalent landed price of
imported urea at Kafue, in nutrient terms. The urea price at Kafue is
derived from the FOB Europe price plus shipping (US$30 per ton) and
handling charges (US$15 per ton) at Indian Ocean ports plus inland
transport by rail (US$41 per ton) and 10% transportation losses. (The



- 45 -
losses at present are about 15-20% but are assumed to come down to 10Z
through improvements in distribution). The FOB urea price is based on IBRD
commodity projections. Bagged urea prices, FOB Europe, in 1984 constant
dollars are forecast as follows: 1985-US$135, 1986-US$120, 1987-US$146,
1990-US$190 and 1995-US$206. Urea prices are expected to recover during
the next few years from their current historically low levels.
8.03    Variable Costs.  Variable operating cost estimates used in the
economic analysis are given in Annex 8-1, Table 2.  These costs are ex-NCZ
plant including freight, insurance and handling expenses. On this basis,
the economic costs/ton used are: coal US$33.11, pyrites US$28.30, lime
US$33.96 and lime (hydrated) US$42.45. The economic price of packing
materials is US$0.80 per bag which is equal to the cost of imported bags.
The delivered price of coal, the major cost item, is competitive with the
imported Zimbabwe coal. Pyrites and lime are produced locally and imports
are not practical, therefore their domestic prices have been used. The
economic prices of NPK intermediates and fuel oil are based on IBRD
commodity projections.
8.04      Fixed Costs.  For fixed costs of labor, insurance and administra-
tion expenses, domestic costs prevalLing in January 1986 have been used.
For spare parts and chemicals/catalysts the prevailing international prices
have been used. The cost of electricity up to year 1996 is taken at its
opportunity cost (K 160/kw) of selling to Zimbabwe as Zambia has surplus
electricity and exports. After 1996, the economic cost of electricity is
taken at US$0.0063/kWh, 30% higher than the financial cost, as recommended
in the IBRD-UNDP energy assessment report._
B. Economic Rate of Return
8.05      Economic analysis was carried out for the entire NCZ complex
based on the total costs of domestic production as compared with the option
of importing fertilizers, assuming that in the absence of the Project
(rehabilitation) the NCZ operation would be completely shut down. Past
investments were assumed as sunk costs, except for the residual value of
existing facilities (in case of plant shut down) which has been adr\ed as
additional cost in the analysis. For the Project investments themselves,
incremental analysis was done for the base case only, where the Project
costs and benefits were compared with the alternative of operating the
plant in its present condition up to the limits of technical safety without
making any future capital investment. For the entire NCZ complex, the
economic rate of return has been calculated at 26.8% and the net present
value at US$50.1 million (at 12% discounting factor). For the Project
itself, on an incremental basis, these values will be higher at 30% and
US$53.9 million, respectively. The cash flows for the ERR are given in
Annex 8-2 and results of the sensitivity analysis are given on the
following page (both for the entire complex).

8.06      The ERR is sensitive to changes in capacity utilization,
operating costs, urea prices and revenues, and to a lesser extent to other
factors.  However, as shown in the sensitivity analysis, the Project is
expected to withstand reasonable variation in these factors.
C. Foreign Exchange Savings
8.07      The foreign exchange savings for the Project have been calculated
in 1984 real dollar terms based on the foreign exchange component of costs
and benefits plus debt-service on foreign loans (Annex 8-3).  For debt
service, the actual terms at which funds are being lent to the GRZ have
been taken reflecting foreign exchange obligations the Project would add on
to the country's economy. The average annual foreign exchange value of the
Project's output is estimated at US$51.8 million. From these the average
annual foreign exchange cost of inputs (US$20.7 million) and debt service
(US$2.2 million) is deducted. The average net foreign exchange savings
from the Project are calculated at US$28.9 million annually.

D. Other Benefits
8.08      The Project will also generate other substantial benefits to
Zambia. The Project will restructure a critical parastatal enterprise, the
second largest investment (after mines) in Zambia, putting its assets to
efficient use. Rehabilitation of the domestic fertilizer facility will
reduce Zambia's import requirements. Increased domestic production will
also help ensure more continuous and secure supply of fertilizer, thus
allowing Zambia to pursue the development of its agriculture sector.
Direct employment saved by the Project would be about 1,100 permanent
jobs. As part of institutional improvements, training programs will be
instituted for the NCZ staff which will help upgrade technical skills of
the Zambian personnel. Through an improved logistics system the Project

will help improve the fertilizer distribution system and reduce
distribution costs. The Project would have a demonstration effect in
dealing with similar problems of other parastatals in Zambia.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01     The follow:ng major assurances and agreements have been reached
during negotiations.
A.  From the Government that it will either undertake itself or cause to:'
(i)  retain NCZ as a direct subsidiary of ZIMCO and appoint (and
retain) the Board Chairman (and other members), Managing
Director, General Manager, Finance Manager and Internal Auditor
of NCZ with experience and qualifications satisfactory to IDA
(para 5.05);
(ii) maintain the Inter-Agency Fertilizer Coordination Committee and
the Project Steering Committee, with membership and
responsibilities satisfactory to IDA (paras 5.17 & 5.21);

B.  From NCZ that it will:
(i)  employ engineering firms and consultants with qualification
and experience and terms and conditions of employment
satisfactory to IDA (para 5.08);
(ii)  not make any major changes in its organization without prior
consultation with IDA, and prepare and submit to IDA for review,
by March 31, 1986, an Organizational Restructuring Study and
implement its recommendations in consultation with IDA (para
5.09);
(iii) develop its training program by June 30, 1986 for review and
implement it in consultation with IDA (para 5.10);
(iv) take all measures necessary to bring its staff strength to no
more than 1,100 by end 1986; and by December 31 of each year



- 48 -
submit to IDA for review and approval, a detailed action plan on
cost reduction measures (para 5.12);
(v) carry out and submit to IDA by September 30, 1986 Energy Audit,
Environmental and Safety Studies, in accordance with Terms of
Reference satisfactory to IDA, review, and implement their
recommendations in consultation with IDA and operate its plants
under environmental and safety conditions satisfactory to IDA
(paras 5.20 and 5.33';
(vi) prepare and furnish to 1Y for review, by February 15 of each
year, its production and financial plans and maintain auditlng
and reporting requirements as described in para 7.06;
(vii) by April 1, 1986 set its ex-factory price of fertilizers
equivalent to CIF landed cost (paras 5.13 & 7.07); and
(viii) maintain minimum current ratio of 1.1 during 1986/87-1987/88 and
1.4 thereafter, debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 from 1987/88
onwards and debt/equity ratio of not more than 60:40 and not (i)
declare dividends during project execution, and (ii) undertake
any major expansion plan (over US$2 million annually) without
prior consultation with IDA (para 7.07).
9.02      Conditions of Credit effectiveness are:
Ci) signing of a contract for the rehabilitation of NCZ II plant,
with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para 5.19);
Cii) signing of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the GRZ and NCZ,
with terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA (para 6.03); and
(iii) effectiveness of the FRG loan (para 6.03).
9.03     On the basis of the above assurances and agreements, the Project
is suitable for an IDA Credit of US$10 million equivalent to the Republic
of Zambia. The GRZ will onlend the proceeds to NCZ with terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA, including an onlending rate of 9.7% p.a.,
and repayment over 15 years including 5 years of grace. The foreign
exchange risk will be borne by NCZ.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR FERTILIZER DEMAND FORECASTS
1.        1980 is assumed as -reference year  for making forecasts as it
is considered as a representative year in terms of area cropped and
rainfall. Subsequent years were affected both by a persistent drought
which prevented farmers from using top dressing on cereals and/or by
adverse prices of fertilizers compared to crop prices in the planting
season.
2.        Fertilized area cropped by commodity has been calculated on the
basis of crop production and "typical yield-.
3.        Crop production figures used in the estimate are the official
marketed production figures increased by an estimated factor to account for
that part of production which is not commercialized but could have
originated from fertilized land and consumed directly at the production
site. These estimated factors for each major crop are as follows: maize,
+50Z; groundnut, +70%; and paddy rice +30%
4.        Commercial farmers' calculated cropped area for maize as well as
sugar and wheat have been cross-checked with known area planted, as areas
planted by large estates are well known.
5.        A cross-check on small-scale farmers has been done using data on
small-scale farmers receiving credits.
6.        The fertilizer consumption per commodity has been estimated
taking into account average application per crop. For the emergent farmers
and small holders it is very difficult to assess the real application
rate. Considering (i) differences between commercial sector and small
holders that exist in neighboring countries (for example, Malawi), and (ii)
recommended application rate for growing hybrid maize ZH 1, which is mainly
used by small-scale farmers, it can be estimated that N and P205 average
consumption per ha in the emergent sector is roughly half of that in the
(_aercial sector.  For the commercial sector assumed application rates are
in accordance with the recommendations of MAWD and Mount Makulu Research
Station.
7.        The following percentages have been used to assign thn share of
total crop production from the commercial sector and small holders.

8.        Losses/misuse at the farm level have been taken into account as
follows: 15% for commercial farmers and 20% for small holders.
9.        On the basis of the above assumptions, the fertilizer demand for
the base year 1980 has been calculated by crop and farm type, as summarized
in Table 1, on the following page.
10.       Fertilizer consumption forecasts are based on two scenarios
(high-growth and low-growth) which take into consideration different
technical and economic evolutions (improved fertilization/cropping
techniques, improvement of extension services, availability of credit and
improved seeds, encouraging or discouraging ratios for N prices versus
maize prices, etc.). The pattern of fertilizer requirements is not
expected to change significantly, as maize will remain the main crop.
Also, the relative importance of straight and compounds fertilizers is
assumed to remain in the same order of magnitude.
11.       Based on the above considerations, the estimated future average
annual growth rate'of fertilizer demand (both for Nitrogen and P205)
expressed in nutrients (based on 1980 consumption) would be:
high growth scenario: 3.4% per year
low growth scenario:   0.9% per year

ZAMBIA - FERTILIZER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT FIRM
I. OBJECTIVE OF THE SERVICES
1.        To ensure that the NCZ's fertilizer plant at Kafue will be
operated efficiently at internationally competitive production costs, NCZ
will engage the services of an Operations Management Firm (OMF) with
experience in running nitrogen fertilizer plants for the period beginning
October 1985 to December 1989 to provide experienced staff for in-line
positions in NCZ. The principal objective of the services required of the
firm will be as follows:
(i) to manage the plant by providing experts in key management
and operational positions during and after the technical
rehabilitation;
(ii) to control and reduce operating costs to ensure that NCZ's
product costs are competitive with international standards
and strengthening of financial and management information
system to support efficient operations and management;
(iii) to coordinate and integrate the implementation of the
rehabilitation work of the NCZ complex; and
(iv) to train local personnel for managerial and operational
responsibilities so that the facilities can continue to be
efficiently run after the firm's departure.
II. SCOPE OF THE SERVICES
2.        The services required shall include, but not be limited, to the
following:
A.  Organizational Restructuring, Management Information System and Cost
Control
3.        While NCZ's operations have grown in the past, its organization,
systems and procedures have not been adapted to the efficient management of
the company's growth. There is a need to review the organizational
structure and streamline it to make it responsive to the present and
projected needs of the company. In addition, it is also necessary to
develop proper systems and procedures, including financial and management
information system, production optimization and cost control, to enable
effective company management. While the facilities are still under
rehabilitation, OMF will send in an initial team of operating management
with good analytical experience to work in appropriate positions within NCZ
to develop full appreciation of the organizational structure, and at the
same time initiate comprehensive review of the existing organization with
the objective of introducing modern efficient systems to NCZ's management
and operations.



- 63 -
ANNEX 5-1
Page 2 of 3
4.        The review exercise should include review of the operations of
all departments of NCZ, including general management, finance, accounting,
personnel administration and operating and supporting services, as well as
personnel and compensation policies, current staffing structure, experience
and qualifications of staff and training needs, procurement policies, cost
control, inventory control maintenance practices, and other policies. The
review should result in very specific recommendations aimed at making NCZ's
production cost competitive and restructuring the organization to better
fit the requirements of a more efficient and profit-oriented organization,
elimination of redundant staff, productivity and performance-linked
compensation policies, establishment of financial and management
information system for efficient planning and monitoring of operations, and
personnel policies emphasizing qualifications and experience meeting the
requirements of NCZ. The cost and benefits associated with the
recommendations should be clearly spelt out, along with an Action Plan for
their implementation and how the implementation results are to be measured.
5.        The review will be completed by March 31, 1986.  Two reports
shall be submitted to NCZ, the first containing the detailed documentation
of the organizational and systems review and the recommended changes,
including the quantified costs and benefits; and the second the Action Plan
for the implementation of the recommended changes and how the results of
the Action Plan are to be measured. The Action Plan will be implemented
during 1986-87 following review by NCZ.
B. Plant Management
6.        ONr will provide a minimum of six top-level managers and 12 other
middle-level experts for the operations management of NCZ. The six
top-level managers will cover the positions of General Manager, Production
Manager, Maintenance Manager, Technical Manager, Personnel and
Administration Manager and Technical Coordinator. The positions of the
OMF experts and the duration of assignments is given in
Attachment 1. NCZ will have the authority to change the positions and
duration of assignment of the OMF experts. The Technical Coordinator has
joined NCZ in June 1985 (initially part-time) and other OMF plant managers
will begin to take responsibility by October 1985. It is expected that
before completion of the technical rehabilitation of the NCZ I plant only a
limited number of OMF personnel will be deployed to assist in the
management of NCZ and carry out the organizational review. OMF experts
will be operating not as advisors but as responsible senior staff in key
line positions, with proper authority and responsibility. All OMF
personnel will be provided with counterpart NCZ staff who will be expected
to take over such positions after the departure of OMF personnel. The
OMF's General Manager will report directly to the NCZ's Managing Director.
7.        OMF will have the precise responsibility of achieving
satisfactory production targets while minimizing production costs. OMF
will also ensure full harmonization and integration of OMF staff and the
existing NCZ personnel that are deemed qualified and experience for
retention by NCZ.
8.        By September 30, 1986, OMF will prepare and submit the following
three studies to NCZ: (a) an Environmental Study containing a detailed



- 64 -
ANNEX 5-1
Page 3 of 3
review of possible environmental problems determined by liquid effluents
and solid wastes from the fertilizer complex and proposed measures and
costs to comply with local or international regulations, whichever
applicable; (b) a Safety Case Study, according to the recent IDA guidelines
on the matter, to identify possible hazards deriving from the nature of NCZ
operations and to recommend corrective actions; and (c) an Energy Audit
Study, containing a detailed energy survey unit by unit and for the whole
complex indicating level of energy cotsumption, identifying areas where
energy savings can be achieved and describing proposed measures and related
costs and benefits.
C. Technical Coordination of Rehabilitation Work
9.        The services are attached as Attacbment 2.
D. Training of NCZ Staff
10.       The training is aimed at improving the professional skills of
local staff at all levels. Training of staff in areas such as plant
operation, maintenance, inspection, logistics, procurement, etc. will be
carried out mostly at NCZ premises and at other locations in Zambia, but
limited training is foreseen abroad with main focus on technical, financial
and managerial training. OHF will devise and implement a detailed training
program as part of the Organizational Restructuring Study. OMF will design
a detailed training program for each Zambian staff, specifying training
needs, proposed training program and expected achievements. The program
will also include the description of the evaluation performance mechanism
by which OMF will periodically monitor the performance of the Lrainees.
Once approved by NCZ and IDA the plan will be implemented under the direct
responsibility of OMF. The implementation of training program will be
periodically monitored by NCZ. OMF will prepare a training progress report
annually which will indicate achievements, problems encountered, and
measures to further strengthen the professional skills of NCZ staff to
enable them to manage and operate the plant efficiently. In addition, OMF
will prepare a training completion report at the end of its assignment.
III. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
11.      At the beginning of each year, OHF will present to NCZ a proposed
work program for the next twelve months, specifying operating costs,
budget and performance targets (in terms of capacity utilization, specific
consumptions, reduction of variable and fixed costs, training, etc.) This
work program will be reviewed and agreed upon with NCZ. Ac the end of each
year, NCZ will review the performance of the OMF team in the past twelve
months of activity and based on the agreed work program assess achievements
in operations, organizational restructuring, cost reduction and training,
etc. Based on such review NCZ may require changes in the manpower needs
for the coming years. In the event that upon such review OMF level of
performance is considered unsatisfactory, NCZ will have the option to
terminate OMF services.

ZAMBIA - FERTILIZER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE 1NTER-AGENCY FERTILIZER COORDINATION COMMITTEE
1.        In connection with the rehabilitation of NCZ facilities to
restore efficient operations, it has been decided to establish an Inter-
Agency Fertilizer Coordination Committee (the 'Committee") to be
responsible for:
(i)  coordinating and integrating fertilizer demand projections with
fertilizer production and import plans. The Committee will
develop reliable arrangements between NCZ and fertilizer
distribution agencies in order to ensure timely and effective
communication of production schedules and deL'veries;
(ii) ensuring that the coal supplied to NCZ;
(a) is in adequate quantity, supplied at appropriate levels by
Maamba Colleries, and by making available proper facilities
f-r the rail transportation of coal ia order to ensure at
least one month supply of coal in NCZ available at all
times;
ob) is of adequate quality (size, moisture and ash content); and
Cc) is offered at a fair price, linked to the quality of coal,
and established by taking into account the losses and delays
occurring during the transportation of coal.
(iii)  ensuring that the delivery of NCZ's output to NAMBOARD is done in
an efficient and timely manner by developing reliable
arrangements among NCZ, Zambia Railways and NAMBOARD; and
(iv)  establishing a system of penalities and incentives in orler to
effectively sustain (contractual) arrangements including payments
of commodities/services reached among Maamba Colleries, Zambia
Railways, NCZ and NAMBOARD concerning the:
(a) levels and quality of coal supplied by Maamba Colleries;
(b) timing and losses in the delivery of coal by Zambia
Railways;
(c) ability of NCZ to take delivery of the agreed amounts of
coal within established quality parameters;

(d) efficiency and timing of Zambia Railways deliveries of
fertilizer from NCZ to NAMBOARD; and
(e) ability of NAMBOARD to take delivery of the agreed amount of
NCZ's fertilizer.
(v) ensu-e efficient transport of domestically produced and imported
fertilizer by Zambia Railways and TAZARA Railways.
2.        The Committee will meet once every month, starting January, 1985,
during the operational life of the plant and will be chaired by the
Executive Director of ZIMCO. It will provide historical record of its
deliberations. The Committee will have the following composition:
(i) Executive Director of ZIMCO
(ii) General Manager of NCZ
(iii) General Manager of Zambia Railways
(iv) General Manager of Maamba Collieries
(v) General Manager of NAMBOARD

Annex 7-1
Page I of 2
ZAMBIA - FERTILIZER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
1.        The Project life is assumed to be 12 years after rehabilitation
with no salvage value at end. The cost and benefit streams have been
expressed in constant 1984 dollars for purpose of financial rate of
return. The capital costs have been adjusted for the residual value (K 35
million) of existing facilities (in case of plant shutdown). The financial
projections have been carried out in current Kwacha to reflect the actual
financial position of the company. The cost and benefits have been
converted into current Kwacha terms from 1984 constant dollars by using
prevailing exchange rate of US$1 - K 2.1, 3.1 and 6 for 1984, 1985 and 1986
onwards, respectively, and the estimated international inflation rates
(7.2% in 1986, 6.8% in 1987-88, 7.0% in 1989, 7.1% in 1990 and 4.0%
thereafter) assuming that the difference between the domestic and
international inflation rates will be reflected in the exchange rate.
2.        Capacity Utilization.  The capacity utilization and the forecast
production levelr are given in Chapter VII, Table 7.1.   The plant's
production levels have been expressed in terms of the capacity utilization
of the ammonia units which a:e more difficult to operate due to complex
technology. It has been assumed that the rehabilitated plants will achieve
70% capacity in the first year of operation, and thereafter, the NCZ I
ammonia plant is assumed to operate at 80% capacity and the NCZ
II plant at 75% because of limitations on its downstream units. The
corresponding capacity levels for downstream units are about 85% for both
plants. The downstream fertilizer facilities are easy to operate and in
most developing countries are operated at 90-95%. The ammonium nitrate,
compound fertilizer blending units, etc., at NCZ have often operated at
high capacity (on average over 90% during 1973-79) when ammonia was readily
available. The NCZ I plant would have a deficit of ammonia on the
downstream units, but the balance (4,380 tpy) is assumed to be provided by
the NCZ II ammonia unit, which has been designed in excess of its
downstream units. The NCZ II ammonia unit running at 75% capacity will be
able to supply enough ammonia to operate the NCZ II ammonium nitrate unit
at 85% capacity, and to supply 4,380 tons of ammonia to the NCZ I plant.
It is assumed that the ammonium sulfate plant will also run at 85Z
capacity. Without rehabilitation, the NCZ I plant can be expected to end
its useful life by 1989, and the NCZ II plant by 1993.
3.        Revenues.  All fertilizer production is assumed to be marketed as
produced without change in the present inventory levels. For output
presently prevailing (January 1986) domestic ex-factory prices have been
assumed to remain constant in real dollar terms except for fertilizers and
explosives for which beginning April 1986 economic prices have been assumed
as explained in Annex 8-1.
4.        Fixed Costs.  The currently prevailing (January 1986) prices for
fixed costs have been assumed to remain constant in real dollar terms and



- 73 -
Annex 7-1
Page 2 of 2
the costs have been adjusted for volume differences. These assumptions are
realistic given the cost reduction measures under implementation.
Additional maintenance cost of US$3.8 million has been added in 1991 and
1995 each to undertake extraordinary plant maintenance.
5.        Variable Production Costs.  Specific consumption levels for
inputs are given below.
Specific Consumption Levels

NR3/AN                         0.26                  0.24
Nitric Acid/AN                 0.89                  0.84
NH3/AN Total                   0.527                 0.484
NH3/AS                         0.318                 0.270
H2S04/AS                       0.828                 0.786
During the first year of operation, an additional allowance of 5% has been
added for coal consumption.   For imported items prices based on IBRD
commodity projections have been used. The current market prices for
domestic raw materials and utilities have been assumed to remain constant
(in real dollar terms) during the Project life. These are: coal K 234/ton,
pyrites K 200/ton, lime K 240/ton, lime hydrated K 300/ton, fuel oil
K 1603/ton, and bags K 2.76/unit.
6.        Depreciation.  In line with NCZ's present practices, fixed assets
are depreciated at 7.5% p.a. using straight line method. The cost of
technical assistance and training under IDA component has been expensed in
the year of expenditure incurred.
7.        Taxes & Dividends.  In Zambia, corporate income is taxed at a
uniform rate of 50%. However, since the company has carried over the tax
allowances and losses of over K 230 million, as of March 31, 1985 (and are
expected to exceed K 300 million by 1986 because of new investments and
further losses), NCZ will not be expected to pay taxes until 1992 when
these losses have been compensated. Dividend payments at the rate of 12%
of the paid-in-capital have been assumed beginning 1990 onwards.
8.        Permanent Working Capital.  Estimates of permanent working
capital are detailed in Table 1.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.        Capital Cost Estimates.  The economic capital cost of the Project
is derived from the current expected capital cost adjusted to 1984 constant
dollars using IBRD MUV index after deducting import duties and local taxes
on imported equipment and other items and after shadow pricing local
costs. The total economic capital cost of the Project was calculated by
adding the residual value of existing facilities (to be recovered from
plant shutdown):

2.        Revenues.  Table 1 gives economic prices used in the analysis.
It is assumed that Zambia will continue to import ammonium nitrate until
1990 and thereafter it can substitute ammonium nitrate with urea because it
is more economical to import urea due to its lower transportation costs for
the same amount of nutrient. The economic price of ammonium nitrate is
derived fLam landed price at Kafue of imported urea using a conversion
factor of 0.728 (.3351.46) based on the nitrogen content and adding a
premium of 15% on FOB1/. Urea price at Kafue is derived from FOB Europe
price plus shipping and unloading charges at Indian Ocean ports plus inland
transport by rail, plus 10% transportation losses. At present the losses
are 15-20% but can be reduced to 10% -through improvements in distribution.
FOB urea price is based on IBRD commodity projections, in 1984 real
dollars.  The transportation cost of US$86/ton are: sea freight and
insurance US$30/ton; handling at port US$15/ton; rail transport from port
1/   Historically, in Europe ammonium nitrate carries a premium of 15-20Z
over urea for equivalent nitrogen content because of its uses for some
special crops and preference by farmers.

to Zambia border (assuming 2/3 supply through Dar es Salaam port and 1/3
through East London port) US$36; and rail transport from border to plant
site US$5. Transportation cost for imported fertilizers has been
calculated on the basis of efficient operation, assuming that the present
transport difficulties will be overcome. The remaining part of NCZ's
output, namely explosive grade ammonium nitrate and the ammonium nitrate
used to produce compound fertilizers (22,000 tons for explosives, 25,900
tons for NPL), cannot be replaced with urea for technical reasons.
Therefore, its economic price is derived from the landed price at Kafue of
imported ammonium nitrate instead of urea. FOB Europe of ammonium nitrate
is derived from FOB urea price on the basis of nitrogen content and adding
a 15% premium for fertilizer grade and 202 premium for explosive grade2/;
shipping, unloading and handling and inland transportation costs are the
same as for urea.
3.        The economic price of NPK compounds has been calculated based on
the volume and type of ingredients required. The value of ammonium nitrate
is same as above for fertilizer grade, ammonium sulfate is equivalent to
ammonia nitrate explosive grade (because of the valuable sulfur content),
and for DAP, TSP, MOP and SOP is equal to their respective CIF prices. A
US$5 per ton allowance has been added to cover the blending costs. The
price of sulfuric acid has been assumed to be US$102 per ton and the price
of nitric acid has been calculated from the price of ammonium nitrate on a
nitrogen content basis.
4.        Operating Costs.  Operating cost esAimates (variable and fixed)
are discussed in Chapter VIII and given in Table 2.
5.        Working Capital.  The economic working capital for the Project
has been calculated as the incremental requirement that the Project will
impose on the total working capital requirements for the country. In
addition to taxes and duties, accounts receivable and accounts payable and
operating cash have been omitted as they do not represent costs incurred by
the economy, but merely instruments of 'transfer of obligation". Finished
goods inventory has also been omitted since in the case of import
substitution the inventory of fertilizer produced by the Project
substitutes for that of imported fertilizer and does not increase the
country's total inventory. Details are given in Table 3.
2/   For explosive grade AN, premium is higher than fertilizer grade AN
because of its better quality and specific uses.
