MIMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF TH PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECIVE DnECORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FANCMEA, S.N.C. WITH THE GUARANTE
OF THE UNIM  MXCAN SATES FOR A
LABOR MARKEr AND PRODUClIVITY ENEHANCEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), with the guarantee of the United Mecan States, for
US$174.0 million equivalent to help finance a project for Labor Market and Produativity
Enhancement. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 15
years, including five years of grace. NAFIN would be the Borrower and the Secretariat of Labor a.d
Social Welfare (STPS) would be the executing agency.
2.    RaftmwW. The Government's success in stabilizing, liberalizing and privaizing the
economy in recent years has set the stage for long-term economic development. However, prospects
for sustained private sector-led growth remain constramed by several long-standing labor market
issues. First among these is Mexico's low rate of labor productivity growth, which limits the
international competitiveness of its producers and the potential for improvements in the living
standards of workers. Low labor productivity growth, especially prevalent among micro, small and
medium sized enterprises (MSMEs), is linked to insufficient levels of on-the-job human capital
accumlation and to a limited capacity to adopt new production processes and technologies. A second
issue is employment instability for a significant portion of the population, which results in lower on-
th-job training and, thus, reduced earnings opportunities. A third concern is a possible increase in
rural migration flows and unemployment resulting from the acceleration of the economic resuctuing
process expected from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Address;ng these
issues will require policies aimed at increasing the productivity of Mexican workers, facilitating the
transformation of production processes and the adoption of new technologies, and improving the flow
of labor between expan6ing and contrctig sectors and regions. These policies, which emphasize
post-school accumulaion of human capital, would complement efforts aimed at increasing the general
educational level of the population. However, at present, effective policy design and implementation
is impeded by limitations of existing data and &;te lack of analysis of labor market issues.
3.    Recognizing the importance of these problems, the Mexican Government is now giving
highest priority to the development of human resources th'ough investments in human capital, both
before and after entry into the labor market. It is also making major efforts to reduce the cost of
labor mobility and facilitate labor market adjustment. Recent policy documents expanding on the
National Development Plan 1989-94 reflect the strong commiment of the Government to build up
Mexico's human capital in the context of a free-market oriented str. The Secretariat of Labor
and Social Welfare (STPS)-by law, the leading institution in matters related to employment, labor
market regulations, inservice training, productivity, and working conditions-is ffie exetig  agency
for the National Traning and Productivity Program 1990-94, intended to: (a) support private sector-
led growth by increasing the skills of the labor force, promoting productivity improvements and
faciltating labor mobility; and (b) broaden the basis for growth through a wider distribution of
income-generting opportunities within the population. The importance attached to increases in
productivity and competitiveness in light of NAFTA is also reflected in the National Agreement for
Inceased Oualt and Prod cti   signed in May, 1992 by the Government and representatives of
business and labor, which aims to modify traditional forms of organization and management,
including promotion and wage schemes to reward individual performance and foster productivity
growth. Over time, the Government intends to concentae on a technical assistance and policy
formulation role in labor markets as privae enterprises sharply increase their contributions to training



costs. The Government has prepared a sector policy statement in support of the proposed project and
the policy changes it embodies.
4.    Proect O    ives. The proposed project would assist the Government of Mexico in
promoting private sector-led growth and in easing the costs of labor mobility and labor market
adjustment by: (i) increuing the productivity and competitiveness of MSMEs; (ii) reducing costs
incurred by employees and employers of hiring and job search, providing education and training
opportunities for displaced and unemployed workers, with special attention to women; and (iii)
improving the availability, timeliness and dissemination of labor market information and, more
broadly, the capacity to monitor labor market changes and to design, evaluate and implement relevant
policies and programs in the sector.
5.       j  l. The proposed project would consist of three major components: (a)
the Productivity Enhancement Component (28% of total project cost including contingencies) would
support activities aimed at increasing the productivity and competitiveness of MSMEs by: (i)
extending the coverage of the pilot in-service tiaining program (Multiple Support Service Program to
MSMEs, CIMO) initiated under the Manpower Training Project (La. 2876-ME, 1987) and expanding
the scope of support services provided to MSMEs; (ii) strengthening coordination between CIMO and
other instiuons rendering -upport to MSMEs; and (iii) promoting the gradusA privatization of CIMO
by increasing the involvement of enterprise associations in its financirg and operation and the gradual
ransformation of Regional Productivity Support Units (UPCs); (b) the Labor Market Adjustment
5omponent (61% of total project cost) would improve the coverage and efficiency of State
Employment Services (SEEs) and provide education and training opporities for displaced workers,
through: (i) strengthening the operation and management of the SEEs, and improving the quality and
availability of information on local and regional labor markets; (ii) providing improved retraining
programs for approximately 300,000 displaced and unemployed workers meeting stringent selection
criteria; and (iii) intoducing, on a pilot basis, an education and trainig program for underqualified
rural migrants who are ineligible for rvegular retraining; and (c) the Information. Policy and
Instixtiona Strnhein  Mg        (11% of total pro;ct cost) would improve the availability,
timeliness and dissemination of labor market information, and strengthen institutional capacity to
design, operate and evaluate labor market policies and proprams, including: (i) supporting the
development of an information system and the undertking of inAepth surveys to provide the basis for
periodic and systematic labor market data generation and analysis; (ii) promoting an extensive
program of studies and research on labor market issues, programs and policies; (iii) fostering regular
publication and dissemination of labor market information; (iv) instituting a systematic framework for
program evaluation; and (v) stengthening STPS's management and teh     capacity through human
resource development and modernization of its data management system.
6.    The total project cost is estimated at US$355.9 million equivalent, including taxes and duties
(estimated at US$8.1 million), with a foreign exchange component of US$14.1 million equivalent. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursement, and the disburement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of US$11.0 million equivalent would be granted for expenditures on key
actvities of the productivity enhancement and labor market adjustment components icurred after July
1, 1992 to avoid interruption  of tehnica support to enterprises and of the training of unemployed and
displaced workers between the loan closing of the existing Manpower Training Project and
effectveness of the proposed project. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group operaions in Mexico are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 11095-ME dated November 23, 1992, is being distributed separately.

7.    Project nMlementation. The project would be implemented over a five-year period (1993-97)
by STPS, asisted by NAFIN, under management arragement similar to those used for the
Manpower Training Project, selectively strengtened as justified by the experience of the operation.
The project organization would have two levels: the central level, represented by STPS, which would
have overall responsibility for project coordination and implementtion; and the local level through
the SEEs and the regional MSME support units, which would be responsible for the implementation
and delivery of services to unemployed workers and enterprises. These arrangements have proven to
be highly conducive to effective and efficient project implementation under the previous project.
8.    Poect Sustainability. The project aims to develop self-sustaining 'inancing and implementing
capabilities for human capital investments in enterprises through a growing involvement of private
sector organizations. It also aWms at developing more flexible labor markets and more effective
Government assistance to firms, individuals and training providers, without increasing permanent
STPS staff. Sustainaility of the retraining program would be encouraged by providing proceeds of
the Bank loan on a declining basis. Strong monitoring and evaluation systems and a substantial
program of studies would underpin improved govermnent policies and further strengthen the long-
term sustainability of expected project achievements.
9.    Lessons Learned from Previou Bank Ivolvement. Lessons learned during the
implementation of the CONALEP I and II and Manpower Training projects (Lns. 2042-ME in 1981,
2559-ME in 1985, and 2876-ME in 1987, respectively), as well as training sector experience Bank-
wide, have been incorporated into the proposed project's design: (i) it supports sector policies and
strategies th  seek to strengthen the links between private enterprises and public institutions. Formal
institutional arrange   are also in place to encourage private sector training and involve industrial
business associations in program activities; (ii) it includes cost-sharing arrangements that proved to be
successful between the GCovernment and enterprises for in-service training of workers; (iii) it takes
into account the results -he evaluation of the labor retraining program supported under the
Manpower Training Project to improve the design of the new retraining program, and selection
cnteria for program paiticipation were modified to target those for whom the program was found to
be most cost-effective; (iv) it includes monitoring mechanisms and formal evaluations of the retraining
program and of the MSME support program, based on comparisons with control groups; (v) it was
designed by an experienced team that successfully managed the Manpower Training Project, taking
into account their experiences with the first operation and the results of its mid-term review; and (vi)
it places emphasis on institution-building to improve policy-making capacity.
10.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project's objectives are fully consistent with
the Bank's country assistance strategy to support the shift in the Government's focus toward long-run
development issues, and provide support to private sector-led growth through the provision of social
infrastructre and a well-structured set of incentives. By supporting productivity enhancement
activities in the labor market, the project would contribute to human resource development, which is
key for long-term growth and poverty alleviation. By improving the efficiency in the use of public
resources and by inducing an increased involvement of the private sector in training activities, the
project would support the Government's efforts to rationalize the role of the public sector and
promote private sector-led growth. By targeting specific actions to more vulnerable socio-economic
groups, the project would also promote social mobility and a more equal distribution of the gains
from economic reform. The project would be justified on economic efficiency and equity grounds.
Ihe Government has been showing increasing interest in involving the Bank more closely in policy
and program development in the human resource sector. Follhwvng the good experience of the
CONALEP I, CONALEP II and Manpower Training project, the Bank has been expanding its
support to human capital development in Mexico through the Basic Health, CONALEP m, Primary
Education, and Science and Technology projects (Lns. 3272-ME in 1991, 3358-ME in 1991, 3407-



4 -
M  In 1992, and 3475-ME in 1992, respecvely), and trough the recently signed Initial Education
Project (Lu. 3518-ME). The Bank S the only aid agency in Mexico involved in large-scale numan
resource development prograns and would be able to transfer to Mexico leSons learned Crom Bank
exence in other countries. Future Bank sate  for Mexico aims at supportng private sector-led
growth. An important element of this is ensuring that an adequately educated and trained labor force
exists to take advantage of economic opportunites and that labor displaced as a result of economic
cne  can be re-absorbed into more productive activities at minimal human cost.
11.    Isues ad Aco. During a=9W=  the Government and the Bank reached agreement
on: (a) a final statement of sector policies; (b) modalities for collaboration between STPS, NAFIN
and the Secretatiat of Comrierce and Industrial Development (SECOFI) in providing servces to
MSMEs; (c) the presentation to the Bank by June 30, 1993 of: (i) satisfactory guidelines for the
work incentive scheme for SEE staff; and (ii) satisfatry revued operational manuals for the SEES;
(d) the guidelines for the operation of the pilot Basic Education and Training Program for
inexperienced workers; (e) the submission of the set of short, medium, and long-term statics to be
used for labor market monitoring that would be updated and published regularly, satisfactory to the
Bank, by April 30, 1993; (f) annual project reviews, to be held in November of each year, conducted
joindy by STPS, the Secrtat of PRnance and Public Credit (SHCP), NAFIN and the Bank,
progress reports for which would include proposed budgetary requirements for project implmention
for the subsequent year; (g) the mid-term review, to be held in November 1995, conducted jointly by
STPS, SHCP, NAFIN and the Bank, including the preparation and initiation of an action plan,
satisfctory tj the Bank, by December 31, 1995; (hi) on terms of reference, schedules, and action
plans ps neetied, for: (i) evaluatiors of the Labor Retrining Program for displaced workers; (ii)
evaluadons of the CIM0 program; (Oii) an evaluation of the pilot Basic Pducation and Training
Program by May 31, 1994; and (IV) all the studies and surveys to be conducted under the project.
12.   The conditions of disb_ ni  are: (a) for the financing of mobile employment units, the
presentation of an evaluation, satfory to the Bank, of the experience with the six pilot units
swported under the Manpower Trainng project; and (b) for the work incemive scheme for SEE staff,
prsentation of guidelines, wdsatctory to the Bank, for the operation of said scheme.
13. An event of suspension of disbursements for the retraining program for the unemployed
beyond US$25.0 million would arise if: (1) the Government fils to present to the Bank, within 60
days of the time such amount is reached, a satisfctory evaluation ta: (a) measures the impact of
altenative training programs and delivery systems on the employment and earnigs of the trainees;
(b) identifies possible improvements in program targeting; and (c) assesses the cost-effctiveness of
the program and is different modalities; and (ii) the Government falls to present a plan of acdon,
the      to the Bank, for improving such retraining program in a manner that takes into account
the results of the evaluation. The timetable for the completion of the evaluation and agreed action
plan i8 by March 31, 1995. lnter alia, the number of trainees would not exceed 55,000 per amnnu
until such satisfactory evaluation has been completed.
14. -dVvirownens Aspects. The project (Category C) would have no direct emnronmental effects.
15.   Pmg g Qbjtive Ctabgrie. The project would contribute to Mexico's poverty all:.Iiation
stategy through its assistance to rural migrants and unemployed workers (a large fraction of whom
are women).
16.    .oect Benft    h e project supports the Government's efforts to promote private sectorled
growth and eae the costs of labor mobility. The project would increase productvity and
competiveness in MSMEs, creating higer eanings and employment opportunities for Meican



workers. About 35,000 enterprises, employing about one million worker, are expected to bif
reached. Project benefits, however, would extend beyond the participating enteprses, as the project
is itended to have an important demonstation effect. Through the increased involvement of private
enterprises in MSME support programs and the promotion of doser interw-institudonal links, the
project would also foster improvements in the quality of training services supplied to enterprises and a
faster rate of adoption of new technologies through the provision of a better trined labor force. The
labor market adjustment process would be eased as the improved quality of sevices provided to
unemployed and displaced workers would reduce the costs of hiring and job search, improve the job
matching process and thus provide better opportaities for employment stability and subsequent wage
growi. Approximately two million unemployed workers are expected to benefit from placement
services over the life of the prqposed project. About 300,000 unemployed workers whose cuent
skills fall to match those in demand would also benefit from the training to be provided. The cost-
effdctiveness of the retraining programs will be enhanced by targeting the training to those groups
where evaluation has demonstrated the highest rates of reurn to such training (workers with at least
completed primary education and some work experience). Th. results of an evaluation of training
programs under the Manpower Training Project showed a 20-30% monthly salary increase for male
trainees with some prior work experience. For male target trainees, the evaluation showed that
benefits of program participation outweigh the costs of the program within three months of starting
eMloyment. For younger inexperi  workers and rural migrants, the project is expected to
improve their entry conditions in the urban labor market. In add:ion to sharing the general benefits
Of the project listed above, women would benefit from the improvements to be introduced in the
raining programs and reduction of labor market barriers which hamper the realization of the full
benefits of training by females. Finally, the project would enhance the Government's capacity to
design, monitor and evaluate labor market policies and programs, thus contributing to a more efficient
use of public resources.
17.   Riaka. The main risks are: (a) a possible decline in Government commitment to project
objectives after the change m adminison in 1994. This risk is small given the exitng strong
support for current economic policies and the importance given to productivity and mobility issues in
light of NAFTA; (b) insufficient budgetary allocations to guaratee program sustainability beyond
project completion. This risk will be minimized by the coverage of trainee stipends and recrrent
costs on a declining basis, by incased private sector participation in the financing and operation of
the CIMO program, and by rigorous monitormg of budgetary allocations during the annual project
implementation reviews; (c) slower than expected acceptance by enterprises of the productivity
actions. This risk seems quite small given growing support by private entprises of
inbterventions initiated under the ongoing Bak-supported MaWower Training Project and will be
further mitigated by strengthened program management and availability of services; and (d) project
complexity and the fact that there are many implementing agencies at different levels may limit the
Achievement of the project's objectives. This risk will be mitigated through the early identification
and resolution of any problems which develop through close supervision and through the mid-term
and anual project reviews.
18.  'Recommendation. I am satsfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
