PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS
First Highway Project - (Credit 852-COM)
PREFACE
The First Highway Project was also the first Bank Group operation
in the Comoros, a country which became independent in 1975, a member of ttie
Bank in December 1976 and of 'DA a year later. The project was identified
in March 1977 and appraised in October of that year after it was prepared
under a PPF of US$80,000 which was made available to the Government. The
US$5.0 million credit was approved by the Board on October 5, 1978 and
became effective in January 1979. There was also a US$4.5 million parallel
financing by the African Development Fund (AfDF) for the construction
component of the project and a US$1.0 million cofinancing from the OPEC
Fund for procurement of equipment. Other sources, not part of the project
cofinancing scheme, but with contributions relevant to the implementation
of the three-year road improvement and maintenance program were the Kuwait
Fund with US$2.0 million and European Development Fund with US$1.0 million,
both for equipment procurement. This financing arrangement proved,
however, less satisfactory than expected and caused delay in starting
project implementation (para. 3.06). In the course of project
implementation the European Economic Community approved US$0.7 million
equivalent under Special Action Credit when the Kuwait Fund declined to
finance management for the workshops and shop equipment (para. 2.08).
A US$6.3 million IDA Credit for a Second Highway Project was
approved in October 1981; the Credit became effective in August 1982. The
Project basically continues efforts started under the first one in
improving road maintenance operations and in strengthening the country's
roads organization.
The Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Eastern
Africa Regional Office. In accordance with the revised procedures for
project performance audit reporting, the PCR was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) although it is not proposed to undertake an
audit of the project by OED staff. The PCR was sent to the Borrower
for comments; however, none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS
First Highway Project - (Credit 852-COM)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project consisted of three major components: (a) construction
of a 20.4 km road on Anjouan island, financed in parallel by the AfDF; (b)
the implementation of a three-year road improvement program; and (c)
studies.
The construction part was satisfactorily completed by a French
contractor within appraisal cost estimates but with about six months delay
due to heavy rains and shortage of imported materials and fuel (para.
3.05).
Out of the four studies originally Included in the Project, three
were not carried out: the pre-investment study in the Nioumakele area was
deleted when it was included in an IDA-financed agricultural project;
a detailed engineering study of a road was deleted when the Saudi Fund
decided to finance the subject road without waiting for the outcome of the
study; and another detailed engineering study was deleted when the
feasibility study, the only study carried out of the original four, showed
the improvement of the subject road not to be economically justified
(para. 3.03).
The main objective of the project was the implementation of the
three-year road maintenance program; it was expected to improve
substantially the condition of the road network and with technical
assistanice and training provided by expatriate consultants, it was expected
to create necessary institution building as well. These goals were only
partly achieved due to the following reasons:
(a) a delay of 18 months before the brigades which were to carry out
the three-year program became fully operational, mainly due to
setting up an adequate Government organization for roads (para.
3.07);
(b) Government's inability to collect taxes and duties which were
supposed to feed a re-established Road Fund; this in turn led to
a continuous shortage of loc:al funds for payments of the brigade
crews (para. 3.09);
(c)  even thiough IDA subsequently agreed to finance part of the local
wages, the brigade operations came to a virtual standstill when
the IDA Credit was committed about a year before the Closing
Date, and when only 40% of equipment was operative; (paras. 3.09,
3.10); and



-v-
(d) shortage of qualified local counterparts with adequate education
to be trained by the consultants (para. 3.16).
The above developments resulted in the three-year
program being greatly reduced and the momentum gained during its
implementation being partly lost before the brigades became operational
again in January 1983 under the Second Highway Project.
Consequently, it could be concluded that except for the
construction part, the project was only partially successful. As to the
economic re-evaluation of the project components, sufficient data were not
available to present a meaningful comparison between estimated and actual
economic benefits for the road improvement and maintenance program (paras.
6.04 and 6.07).
A lesson to be learned from this project is that when its
implementation is fully dependent on timely ordering and delivery of
equipment to be financed from other sources, an appropriate co-financing
agreement with such external aid agencies should be arranged prior to the
effectiveness of the Credit (para. 7.02). Also it may be too optimiltic,
in cases like the Comoros where project entities are being reorganised and
built up from scratch that this would be accomplished early enough for the
road program to be successfully implemented in such a short period as three
years. In retrospect either much more lead time should have been assumed
for establishing DEIT (later GDPW) and training of its staff or that other
arrangement --e.g., by contract-- should have been arranged for
implementing the bulk of the road maintenance program while DEIT was being
established.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS
FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT - (CREDIT 852-COM)
I. *ITDUCTION
1.01      The Comoros archipelago consists of four islands, three of which
form the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, namely, Grande Comore,
Anjouan and Moheli; the fourth islaad, Mayotte, is still under French
rule. At appraisal in 1977, the Republic's population was estimated to be
about 370,000 but a more recent data for 1981 present a figure of 364,000.
1.02     The country became independent in 1975, a member of the Bank in
December 1976 and of IDA a year later. A Bank mission surveyed the
Comoros' economy in December 1976. It reviewed a 1978-82 Interim
Investment Plan prepared by the Government and agreed that agriculture and
improvement of transport infrastructure were crucial to the country's
development and should be given high priority.
1.03     The transportation system of Comoros is fairly simple.  Two small
ports accommodating 400 ton and 500 ton coastal vessels on Grande Comore
and Anjouan, one international airport on Grande Comore, two domestic
airports on each of the other islands, and about 720 km of rosds form the
basic transport infrastructure. At appraisal in 1977, it was estimated
that there were some 1,650 vehicles1/ in the country, about 1,400 of them
on Grande Comore where 410 km of roads were located.  On Anjouan there was
a 187-km road system accommodating some 210 vehicles, and on Moheli some 40
vehicles sharing a 120-km road system. The terrain being rugged and
volcanic, more than half of the roads on Grande Comore and Anjouan were
paved to protect them against heavy rains; on Moheii only 30 km were paved.
1.04     The mission initially identified a small road construction
project, the scope of which was later expanded when co-financing
possibilities emerged. IDA provided US$80,000 to the Government in the
form of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to finar.ce project preparation
carried out by a French consulting firm, which worked out details for a
three-year road improvement and maintenance project.  In addition, UNDP was
approached and agreed to finance the detailed engineering study required
for the construction component.  The road project as developed was Lo
become the first Bank Group operation in the country. It has been followed
in August 1982 by a Second Highway Project (Credit 1188-COM, US$6.3
million). Whereas the country's needs are many, financial and
administrative constraints will continue to exist for years to come. In
view thereof, in the first road project much emphasis was made an
initiating instituti.on building, which has continued and expanded under tne
Second H-ighway Project.
1/  The consultants estimated the number to be 3,224 in 1981, or about
double the 1977 appraisal estimate.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
Identification and Preparation
2.01      The unclassified road network supposed to be under scheduled
maintenance comprised at appraisal 340 km of paved roads ane about 380 km
of dry-weather earth roads; the .-st were non-maintained tracks.  The task
of an initial transport mission in March 1977 was to identify a road
project which would include some construction and upgrading, improvement of
road maintenance operations and mechanical workshops and institution
building through technical assistance, training and studies.
2.02      Because of the country's low per capita income and level of
development, the project would have to be an IDA project.  This, in turn,
would have set limitations on the size of the project, if cofinancing were
not to be found. The search, however, was successful when the AfDF and the
OPEC Special Fund expressed willingness to participate in financing of a
project identified and prepared by IDA through its PPW. This made it
possible to prepare a project more than double the size of what would have
been possible had IDA been the sole financing source.
2.03      The project as eventually developed had as its main objectives to
assist in defining and strengthening the institutions responsible for the
road network; to establish and implement a three-year road improvement and
maintenance program, and to make a modest start in expanding the main road
network.  In addition, the project was to finance the preparation, through
studies, of a subsequent highway project and an integrated rural
development project.
2.04      To meet the above objectives, a project was prepared that
included the components shown in detail in Table 1 and summarized below:

Negotiations
2.05      After AfDB and the OPEC Fund had confirmed their intention to
contribute to the project, the IDA credit was negotiated in August 1978 on
the basis of the financing scheme shown in detail in Table 2 snd summarized
below:
(US$ million)
Local     Foreign    Total
AfDF                         0.72         3.78      4.50
OPEC Fund                     -           1.00      1.00
IDA                          0.24         4.76      5.00
Government                   0.56          -        0.56
Total                   1.52         9.54    11.06
- _-M_O
Additional financing were to be provided by the Kuwait Fund (US$2.0
million) for road maintenance equipment and workshop managers, and the
European Development Fund (EDF) (US$1.0 million) for equipment. However,
procurement of this equipment was not part of the project and was not
included in its cost estimates, even though it was necessary for the
implementation of the IDA-financed project.
2.06      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following
major points:
(a) a road classification system would be introduced before the end
of 1978, and annual traffic counts on major roads would be
initiated in 1979;
(b)  an 8-ton axle load limitation would be enforced;
(c) a vehicle registration system would be re-established by the end
of 1979;
(d) a Road Fund would be re-established by the end of 1978; and
(e) consultants would be engaged for technical assistance, training
and studies.
2.07      Effectiveness of the IDA Credit was made conditional upon
notification by the OPEC Special Fund that all conditions precedent to
disbursement of their loan were fulfilled. This caused a delay of over
three months before the VS$5 million IDA Credit 852-COM, approved by the
Board on October 5, 1978, became effective. The Credit became effective on
January 29, 1979.



- 4-
2.08      However, shortly thereafter it became apparent that expected
financing of workshop e.quipment and managers to reinforce the Government by
the Kuwait Fund (outside the project) would not materialize, limiting the
use of the US$2 million Kuwait Fund loan to the procurement of road
maintenance equipment only. In view of this, the Government successfully
approached the EEC for financing of technical assistance, equipment and
materials for workshop improvements. In August 1979 it received a
US$700,000 equivalent from the EEC Special Action Credit which was
administered by IDA.
2.09      The Ministry of Equipment, Improvement of Territory and Quality
of Life (MEITQL) was renamed to Ministry of Equipment and Environment
(MEE) shortly after the Credit became effective. ME was to be responsible
for the overall project execution, through the Directorate of Equipment and
Improvement of Territory (DEIT). The road maintenance division within DEIT
would be responsible for execution of road improvement and maintenance by
force account and for repair and maintenance of equipment. The technical
assistance team, required to be retained as a condition of the Credit
agreement, was to operate in an advisory capacity within DEIT; its team
leader was to be responsible to DEIT for supervising the implementation of
the three-year road maintenance and improvement program.
1II. PROJECT IPLEMNRT&TION AND COST
General
3.01      The project was completed by December 31, 1981.  However,
shortage of local funds and serious delays in ordering and deliveries of
equipment financed by others, outside the project, caused actual
achievements of the three-year road improvement and maintenance program to
be only about half of what was expected at appraisal. The only project
component completed as envisaged was the construction of the 20.4 km
Nioumakele road on Anjouan island which had parallel financing from AfDF,
(para. 3.05).  Given tlhe difficult manpower constraints the
institution-building objective of the project was reasonably well attained.
Changes in the Project
3.02      A major change in the project and its schedule of disbursements
(Table 4) resulted from a subsequent IDA agreement to finance from the
proceeds of the Credit part of the cost of wages for some 170 crew members
of the four mechanized rvod upgrading and maintenance brigades (para.
3.09).
3.03      Another change resulted from the decision to delete three of the
four studies initially intended to be financed from the Credit.  One
deletion was the pre-investment study for an integrated rural development
project in the Nioumakele peninsula area whichi was transferred to an IDA
agricultural Droject. The second deletion waB the detailed engineering
study of the K4iringoni-Nioumachaua road on Moheli after tne feasibility
study showed that this project was not justified.  The third deletion was
the detailed engineering of the Fomboni-{oani-Miringoni road, also on



-5-
Moheli island, when the Saudi Fund decided to finance the construction of
that road without waiting for the outcome of the IDA-financed study.
3.04      The above project changes are reflected in Table 3, which
compares appraisal estimates and actual cost of the project, and Table 5,
which shows estimated, amended, and actual disbursements by categories.
Road Construction
3.05      Construction of the Nioumakele road (20.4 km) was financed in
parallel by the AfDF. A French consultants was retained for supervision of
the works, and AfDF sent its own supervision missions. After international
competitive bidding, the contract was awarded to contractor SNTP (France).
Works started in September 1979 and were satisfactorily completed by April
1981, exceeding the agreed 12 months construction period by about 6 months
because of heavy rains and occasional shortages of imported materials and
fuel. Final cost was US$4.22 million plus US$0.20 million for supervision
by consultants, or US$4.42 million in total compared with the US4.5 million
appraisal estimate (including contii'gencies).
Three-Year Road Improvement and Maintenance Program
3.06      The project provided for the upgrading to all-weather standards
of some 120 km of tracks, the resealing of about 195 km of paved roads, and
the routine maintenance of about 250 km per annum of the country's 400 km
naved road network. This work was to be accomplished in a three-year
period by four force-account mechanized brigades: one, for upgrading of
existing tracks, two patching brigades for repairs, and one bitumen
resealing brigade. The latter brigades would as part of the project be
partly equipped by OPEC, and partly by IDA which in addition was
to finance spare parts, fuel, imported materials and foreign expertise
needed for operations. Unfortunately, since the equipment for the
upgrading unit was to be financed outside the project by EDF and the Kuwait
Fund, the implementation of the IDA project became dependent on the
Government's arrangements with these institutions.  These proceeded too
slow, causing serious delays in ordering and delivery of pieces of
equipment which were crucial for the operations of the brigades. Moreover,
deliveries were delayed by some two to six months, as a result of irregular
and unreliable shipping to the Comoros, and the fact that shipments have to
go first to Madagascar or Reunion, before arriving in the Comoros.
3.07      Another cause of delay was a Government decision to decentralize
certain road activities by delegating them to the Governors of each of the
three islands; justification for this was the slow and unreliable
communications between them. This decision required establishing a
maintenance department on each island, and reallocating equipment with loss
of time and output. In addition, putting existing equipment in working
order took longer than expected, and it was not before September 1980 that
all brigades were fully operational, instead of January 1979 as
optimistically expected at appraisal.



-6-
3.08      Consultants Final Report concludes that the cost of the
three-year operation of all brigades on the three islands has amounted to
CF 755.7 million, excluding depreciation of equipment, of which CF 73.5
million is for the earth road improvement brigade. This leaves CF 682.2
million (US$2.85 million equivalent) for routine and periodic maintenance
of paved roads by the three brigades. Total cost and breakdown for the
three islands is given in the table below (more detailed costs are
presented in Table 4):
Cost in CF million

Routine Maintenance                  47.7           62.9        8.7       119.3
Periodic Maintenance                265.1          262.6       35.2       562.9
Total Paved Road Maintenance        312.8          325.5       43.9       682.2
3.09      Although the Government had complied in principle with the
covenant in section 4.03 of the Credit Agreement demanding the re-creation
of a Road Fund, it was unable to collect the duties and taxes earmarked to
feed this Fund, resulting in a lack of local funds for the project.
Operations would have come to a standstill if IDA would not have agreed
in November 1979 to finance from the Credit an amount of US$270,000 to pay
for the larger part of nages and salaries of the brigades' staff. In doing
so, it was hoped to keep the program going until it could be continued
under the Second Highway Project (approved by the Board in October 1981).
However, the Credit Funds were exhausted by September 1981.
3.10      By that time, the complete labor force including mechanics had
been gradually laid off, and what was to be achieved during the three-year
program was virtually reduced to about half. By the end of the program, no
more than 60 km of earth roads had been upgraded -- compared to 120 km
scheduled -- only about 45 km were resealed instead of the 195 km
contetmplated at appraisal and routine and periodic maintenance operations
were estimated to be about half of what should have been achieved2/. In
addition to shortage of local funds, impediments to the program were also
caused by (i) the country's rugged geographical and topographical
conditions, causing heavier than average wear and tear of equipment; (ii)
shortages of spare parts, imported materials and fuel; and (iii) shortage
of crushed stone for the base course due to inadequate crushing plant.
When operations came to a standstill in September 1981 because of lack of
local funds, only about 40% of the equipment was operative due to lack of
spare parts. Even as late as the end of 1982, essential crushing plant was
not operational due to shortage of spares. Moreover, by that time there
was need for some equipment replacement.
Equipment
3.11      Procurement oi maintenance equipment and spare parts, workshop
equipment and tools and soils laboratory equipment financed under the
project did not experience any particular problems. Because of the small
number of items, the need for standardization with Kuwait and EDF financed
equipment, and the lack of response to international competitive bidding
2/ According to the Consultants' final report.



-7-
for EDF-financed items, IDA had agreed to negotiated procurement following
international shopping.  Consultants assisted in the procurement procedure,
which was delayed because of the delay in Credit effectiveness; by
September 1979 deliveries were completed, well ahead of soms Kuwait Fund
and EDF financed equipment (para. 3.06).
Workshops
3.12      Improvement of two regional workshops in Moroni (G|ande Comore)
and Mutsamadu (Anjouan) was carried out by force ac3unt and were
satisfactorily completed in December 1980. The shop in Fomboni (Moheli)
was improved by a local contractor and completed in February 1981.
Equipment and tools were already delivered in 1979 and have been
installed. There was some delay ir completion of the 'buildings, however,
which was due to shortages of cement, qualified workers, and local funds.
Soils Laboratory
3.13      Improvements and extensions to an existing building was carried
out by force account. Equipment was delivered in August 1979 but it was
not until June 1981 that it was installed, following completion of the
building in late 1980. Lack of a laboratory chief, qualified technicians,
and of budget funds to operate the laboratory, caused the laboratory to
become operative only under the Second Highway Project when the chief
trained in France became available.
Technical Assistance and Training
3.14      Together with the implementation of the three-year road
improvement and maintenance program technical assistance was the most
important project component. The main functions o' technical assistance
were: (a) reorganization of the road administratio ; (b) assistance to DEIT
in establishment and operation of adequate procurement procedures; (c)
improvement in the management of workshops for maintenance of equipment;
(d) training of domestic staff and workers at all levels; (e) assistance in
the implementation of the three-year road improvement and maintenance
program and (f) assistance in the preparation of a Second Highway Project.
3.15      A French consultant was selected under the PPF to carry out the
technical assistance and training program. They had a three-man team in
the field by the end of 1978, before the Credit became effective. The team
was extended gradually, and at maximum it consisted of eight expatriates
with long-term contracts (one to three years), and two with short term
contract (three months).  In addition, there were four experts in
headquarters who occasionally visited the field team (14 man-months
aggregate). By the end of 1981, the Consultant had provided 244 man-months
of technical assistance, including vacations, compared with 126 estimated
at appraisal to be needed in the field, excluding vacations. The 244 also
includes 80 man-months for three workshop managers who initially were
supposed to be financed by the Kuwait FLind. When this arrangement did not
materialize, 48 of these 80 man-months were decided to be financed from the
US$700,000 European Special Action Credit arranged in August 1979 (para.
2.08), while the remaining 32 man-months were financed by the IDA Credit.



-8-
3.16      Performance of the technical assistance team was a qualified
success. A continuous problem has been the shortage of adequate
counterparts with sufficient technical education and managerial skill to be
trained to eventually take over the positioxus filled by the consultants.
Although this problem had not been specifically stated in the appraisal
report as a project risk, it had been raised as an issue during the
Decision Meeting and the meeting had agreed that it was a calculated risk
which had to be taken. As a result, institution building associated with
the transfer of know-how through technical assistance and on-the-job
training was reduced and has not been as successful as expected.
Nevertheless, the framework for a highway administration has been
established and its strengthening is being continued as part of the
Second Highway project. It should be noted, in this regard, that Comoros
will have to rely on expatriate expertise for several years, before a
sufficient number of properly trained nationals can manage and carry out
their own operations.
3.17      Some 140 local staff were trained, ranging from supervisors to
mechanics, electricians, equipment operators, road technicians,
administrative clerks, etc. Also, labor intensive methods were introduced
for maintenance gangs working separately from the brigades. By and large,
workshops have been performing reasonably well.
3.18      Under clause 3.03 (c) of the Credit Agreement, the Borrower was
to prepare a Completion Report upon completion of the project. This task
was actually carried out by the Consultant on the Government's behalf. A
"Final Report" was produced in February 1983 with many tables and naps,
describing in great detail the recommendations, services and
accomplishments of the consultants team. However, some basic data, such as
the list of roads where improvement/maintenance works were carried out is
missing (para. 6.04 and 6.07). Furthermore, since the Consultant was not
involved in the AfDB-financed Nioumakele road construction, this component
is not even mention-d in their Final Report. On the other hand, the Kuwait
Fund and EDF financed equipment has been included indiscriminately.  The
report had also not attempted to recalculate an economic rate of return.
Fellowships
3.19      Two laboratory technicians and three workshop managers have been
trained in France for three months and one year respectively under OPEC and
FED financing.
Studies
3.20      After deleting the three studies included in the original project
(para. 3.03), only the study for the Miringoni-Nioumachoua road on Moheli
island was left in the project. The feasibility study carried out by the
Consultant concluded that the project as designed was not economically
justified. Since Government was not agreable to a lower, more economical
design, no detailed engineeriiig was carried out.

Cost of the Project
3.21       The appraisal cost estimates as presented in para. 2.04 and Table
I are misleading to the extent that the Kuwait Fund and EDF financing of
equipment, without which the project could not be implemented, are not
included in the project cost estimates. Moreover, when the Kuwait Fund
decided not to finance the workshop managers and workshop equipment, part
of these costs were financed by an additional US$0.7 million EEC Special
Action Credit (SAC), administered by IDA (para. 2.08). If all these costs
are taken into consideration the actual project costs amount to US$14.70
million as shown below:

3.22       In view of the above, the cost overrun of the project as
appraised would be only US$0.74 million or 6.7% (including SAC). On the
other hand, studies with an estimated cost of about US$0.57 million were
deleted from the project; if that is taken into account, the cost overrun
would be US$1.31 million or about 12%.
Disbursements
3.23      Comparison between estimated and actual disbursements by category
is shown in Table 5 and timing of actual disbursements compared with
appraisal estimates in Table 6. It should be noted that (a) improvements
to buildings were more elaborate than envisaged at appraisal, and thus
their cost was also hig.her than estimated (category (3)); and (b) ID)A's



- 10 -
disbursements for consultants' services for parts C and D of the project
(category (5)) amounted to US$1.72 million, or more than three times the
US$0.54 million original allocation.
3.24      The amended schedule of November 1979 is virtually the same as
the original one, except that category 11, unallocated, was reduced by
US$300,000, largely to allow for the introducion of two  new categories
consisting of US$270,000 for IDA financing of local wages (category 9) and
a contribution to a US$50,000 revolving fund (category 10) (para. 3.09).
3.25      IDA's actual dis1ursements for consultants' services under
category 5, amounted to US$t.72 million compared with US$0.54 million in
both the original and amendid disbursement schedules. This means that most
of the US$820,000 unallocated (category 10), plus US$450,000 in savings
resulting from the deletion of studies (category 6) were used to pay for
additional cost of consultants' services. In addition to the consultants
cost financed by IDA another US$342,000 were used for workshop managers
financed from the EEC Special Action Credit, and US$488,000 financed from
the OPEC Fund (Table 5). Allowing US$100,000 for preparation of bidding
documents, office equipment and furniture, this brings the total
amountdisbursed for technical assistance purposes to US$2.44 million for a
total of 244 maa-months, or about US$10,000 per man-month average including
travel of staff and families, purchase of cars, etc., and all local cost
for subsistence, local travel and car operations since the Government did
not have the funds to pay for these expenses. As explained in para. 3.15
above, the increase in man-months was mostly due to the additional 80
man-months absorbed by the project when the arrangements for their funding
by the Kuwait Fund did not materialise.
3.26      As to disbursements from the IDA administered Special Action
Credit and the OPEC Fund, these are also shown in Table 5.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.27      By and large performance of the Consultant has been reasonably
satisfactory considering the difficult working conditions including
shortage of suitable local counterparts, lack of local funds and delays in
arranging total project financing. In particular, the shortage of domestic
counterparts with adequate educational background considerably increased
the burden carried by the consultants who, in practice, were acting in a
managerial rather than advisory capacity as originally envisaged.
3.28      Performance of the consulting firm which was selected by the
Borrower for the supervision of the construction of the Nioumakele road was
reported by AfDB to be satisfactory, as was the performance of the
contractor SNTP (France).
3.29      Use of contractors for IDA-financed project components was
negligible being restricted to a few building works such as expansion of
workshops and the soils laboratory; contractors' work was generally
satisfactory.



- 11 -
IV. PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT
4.01      By and large, performance of the Government has not been
satisfactory. However, given the acute constraints in financial and human
resources in the country and the inexperience of the Borrower with IDA
procedures, it would have been difficult to expect a considerably better
performance. The Directorate of Equipment and Improvement of Territory
(DEIT), later renamed General Directorate of Public Works (GDPW), which was
responsible for the implementation of the project, made efforts to
accommodate the consultants who, in practice, did most of the work. There
was, however, a continuous shortage of adequate counterparts, which has
been a problem inherent to the country as a whole, after the departure of
most French officials following independence and before domestic staff
were ready to take over.
4.02      The Government tried to comply with the covenants of the Credit
Agreement, the most important of which are listed in para. 2.06.
Specifically, the Road Fund was re-established in accordance with section
4.03 of the Credit Agreement but a serious problem arose when in practice
the Government was unable to collect the duties and taxes earmarked for
feeding it, in particular those due by other Government agencies such as
the electricity company. The root of the problem, however, is that the
country is still too poor to meet all its local expenditure obligations
without ouside help. In addition, newly established vehicle weight
legislation has not yet been enforced.
4.03      Although the Kuwait Fund and the EDF had committed themselves
before appraisal of the IDA project to finance part of the equipment needed
for the maintenance brigades, it took the Government much too long due to
its lack of experience to finalize the arrangements with these institutions
and to purchase the equipment (para. 3.06); this resulted in some 18
months' delay before the brigades became fully operational. In this
respect, the performance of the Government has been unsatisfactory, since
that delay greatly reduced the usefulness of the IDA-financed project.
4.04      With substantial help of the consultants, progress reporting has
been satisfactory.
V. INSTITUTION BUILDING
5.01     The project no doubt has helped to achieve part of its main
purpose, namely, to first create and thereafter strengthen the country's
road administration. This was an important part of the task of the
technical assistance team which had to start virtually from scratch. The
consultants proposed the establishment of a General Directorate of Public
Works within the Ministry of Equipment and Environment, with the following
services: Federal Directorate for Studies and Programming; Federal Service
for Equipment; Laboratory for Civil Works and Buildings; Federal Service
for Mines and Ports; and three Regional Directorates for Public Works, one
in each of the three islands.  The recomnmeed organizatlon was accepted
and established by a Government Decree, dated June 20, 1980.



- 12 -
5.02      However, the fact that physical accomplishments expected from the
three year maintenance program were reduced to about half has adversely
affected the institution building which was expected to result partly from
on-the-job training during the project implementation (para. 3.10).
However, markable progress wars made, paving the way for further institution
building now being continued under the Second Highway Project.
VI. ICONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Construction of Nioumakele Road 3/
6.01      At appraisal the calculation of the economic rate of return (ERR)
was based solely on value added benefits from anticipated agricultural
production. In the SAR the ERR for the Nioumakele Road (20.4 km) was
estimated at 12%, it was also recognized, however, that the actual figure
would be dependent on the success of agricultural development in the areas
served by this AfDF-financed road construction component. With more
conservative estimates of benefits the ERR was estimated at 8%.
Construction was completed within the cost estimates including
contingencies, but no monitored data are available to judge whether
agricultural production has increased in accordance with expectations at
appraisal.
6.02      Since the relevant agricultural data are not available, a
different approach has been taken by using savings in vehicle operating
costs. At appraisal it was assumed that traffic would increase from 30 vpd
(1978) on the existing earth road to 100 vpd on the n;  paved road.
A traffic count was carried out in June 1983 which yielded 94 vehicles of
which 60 light vehicles and 34 trucks. Using data on vehicle operating
cost savings collected for the appraisal of the Second Highway Project (to
match the timing of the road construction) to the estimated traffic on the
project road, annual vehicle operating cost savings in the first year after
completion (1982) would be in the order of about US$321,000 or 7% of the
US$4.42 million, the actual road investment. This would yield an ERR
ranging from 9% to 12%, depending on the assumption on annual traffic
growth rate, between 4% and 7% over the 20 year life of the road. The
recalculated ERRs are therefore in line with the ones estimated in the SAR.
Road Improvement Program
6.03      At appraisal it was assumed that during the three-year program
the road improvement brigade would upgrade 120 km of earth roads to all-
weather gravel standards, and that this would produce an economic rate of
return of 12% over a 10-year life based on: (a) a cost of US$15,000 per km;
(b) an average number of vehicles per day of 30 in the opening year which
would grow .hereafter by 15% per annum; and (c) vehicle operating cost
savings in the order of US$0.14 per average vehicle/km. According to the
Final PReport, only about about 60 km or about 50% of the intended program
was upgraded in the three years at an average cost of CF 1,230 million or
3/ This project component is not covered in Consultants Final Report.



- 13 -
about US$5,000 per km, excluding cost of equipment, or about US$6,300 per
km, including depreciation of equipment (estimated to amount to about one
quarter of the total cost per km).
6.04      The consultant':, however, did not keep records on which specific
roads the works were carr.ted out. Furthermore, traffic counts were not
carried out on earth/gravel roads. Consequently, there is no viable basis
for calculating actual vehicle operating cost savings and ultimately the
ERR. Accepting, however, the appraisal assumption of 30 vpd, a rough
approximation would be that the economic return on the portion of the
program carried out would likely meet the original ERR of 12%, since the
actual cost per km was less than half the appraisal estimate and would thus
offset the shortfall in achieving the target set at appraisal.
Maintenance Program of Paved Roads
6.05      At appraisal the ERR for the two patching brigades and one
resealing brigade was estimated to be 34%; it assumed that 250 km were
patched and about 70 km of bitumen roads were resealed per annum during the
project period. An average of 100 vpd on the paved roads was assumed bv
1980, and a growth of 5% thereafter.
6.06      Consultant estimates that only 45 km of roads were resealed in
the three-year period, which is only 23% of the 195 km goal. The goal of
the two patching units which repaired shoulders and potholes was to repair
about 250 km, or one third of the main road system, per annum. Consultant
estimates that about 75% of that goal was achieved. Taken these two
accomplishments together, it could be concluded that overall about half of
the expected targets were accomplished over the three years at a total cost
of US$2.85 million. This averages out at about US$2,500 per km per year,
excluding depreciation of equipment. After adding an estimated allowance
of US$600 per km for equipment cost, the total actual cost were US$3,100
per km per year which is too high for routine and periodic maintenance of a
road system with an average traffic density of about 100 vehicles per day.
In view of the above it may be concluded that the 34% rate of return
has not been achieved and that the actual return would be substantially
lower.
6.07      A meaningful recalculation of ERR for the maintenance program
could not, however, be carried out for the following reasons: (a) traffic
counts carried out in 1980 and 1981 covered only a small part of the paved
road network, with huge differences ranging from over 500 vpd (around the
capital Moroni) to less than 50 vpd on the island of Moheli; and (b) the
specific roads where routine and periodic maintenance were carried out were
not presented in the consultants' Final Report.
VII. TUE ROLE OF IDA
7.01      Credit 852-COM for the First Highway Project was the Bank Group's
first operatton in Comoros.  The project choice was sound, since roads are
important infrastructure for agricultural production which is the country's
major economic resource. Also, the country's financial resources being
extremely limited and the IDA contribution being restricted, Lt was a sound



- 14 -
idea to look for co-financing and/or parallel financing from other lending
institutions so as to arrive at an adequate project size.
7.02      In retrospect, it would have been preferable if the construction
component had been left ouside the project, making the IDA project a
time-slice of a continuous road improvement and maintenance prograrm in the
financing of which not only the OPEC Fund, but also the Kuwait Fund and EDF
could have participated as co-financers, rather than independent partners.
By making the effectiveness of the IDA credit conditional upon the
confirmation not only of the OPEC Fund participation but also all the other
project relevant financing partners, the delay in starting up of the
brigade operavions could have been reduced.4/
7.03       IDA tried to accommodate the Government's chronic shortage of
local funds  by agreeing to finance from the Credit an amount of US$270,000
for local wages. This was a positive step. However, less than half of
these funds were actually disbursed before a shortage of funds brought the
operations of the brigades to a virtual standstill. Increases in
consultants' costs, and cost of workshop buildings and equipment consumed
more funds than originally anticipated.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The project was successful to the extent that the road
construction component, making up about 40% of the project cost and
parallel financed by the AfDB was constructed on time and within the
appraisal cost estimate. The remainder of the project was Less
successful. Due to delays in start-up of the program and shortage of local
funds, achievements during the three-year road improvement and maintenance
program were at best only about half of what was expected (para.
3.10).
8.02       The three-year road improvement and maintenance program had a too
optimistic schedule. Namely, at appraisal, it was assumed that the works
would start immediately after the Credit becamue effective, i.e., in January
1979; consequently, the program was originally designed to cover the
1979-81 period. However, under prevailing conditions in Comoros --absence
of institutional organization in roads, severe shortage of qualified
personnel at all levels-- it was simply not feasible to start the physical
implementation of the road works in 1979. Moreover, under those conditions
it could have been assumed that it would take about two years just to
set-up necessary foundations --roads' organization on the three islands,
workshops, necessary training of operators and mechanics, before the
road maintenance output could really start.
8.03      Generally very low-level of economic development with extremely
limited Government revenues exacerbated the diffictlties of project
implementation. Government funding was not sufficient to cover the cost of
local labor. A more realistic approach of the financial support which the

Government could have provided to the project was missing. Therefore, in
the follow-up project (Second Highway, Cr.1188-COM) IDA is participating in
financing part of local wages (at declining rate so that the Government
will take over gradually).
8.04      Overall, it could be ascertained that institution building
resulting from technical assistance and training by expatriate consultants,
although less than expected (para. 5.02), was still reasonably satisfactory
given the difficult financial and manpower situation in the country.
8.05      Rather than separate financing for a component which was
essential to the proper functioning of the rest of the project (para.
2.05); co-financing for all equipment needed for the improvement and
maintenance brigades would have been a better solution. The delay in
financial and operational arrangements between the Government and both the
Kuwait Fund and EDF, independent as they were from the IDA Credit,
adversely affected implementation of the IDA project (para. 3.06).
