FEDERAL ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF THE COMOROS
FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1.  THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting and Its Effect on Transport
Geography
1.01      The Comoro archipelago, located at the northern end of the
Mozambique Channel, consists of four islands about 100 to 300 km from one
another (Map-IBRD 13414, insert). The Republic of the Comoros comprises
three of th se islands, Grande Comore, Anjouan and Mohieli, with a land area
of 1,862 km ; the fourth island, Mayotte, remains under French rule. The
islands are characterized by a rugged topography of volcanic origin, with
laterite soils that support lush vegetation. The climate is marine tropical
with occasional cyclones and rainfall as intense as 400 mm per month during
the six-month rainy season.
Population
1.02      The Republic's pop2lation is estimated at 370,000 in 1977, with
about 400 inhabitants per km of cultivable land. Owing to the high popula-
tion growth rate (3.7% p.a.) and the return in 1977 of about 18,000 Comorians
from Madagascar, the islands of Anjouan and, to a lesser extent, Grande Comore
are becoming overpopulated.
Economy
1.03      The Comoros' economic development is limited and primarily dependent
on agriculture. Food production is insufficient for Local needs, but revenues
from export crops such as ylang-ylang, copra, vanilla and cloves partially
finance supplementary food imports. Distillation of ylang-ylang into perfume
essences is virtually the only "industrial" activity. It is estimated that
agriculture contributes about 38% to GDP, a further 40% is contributed by the
services sector, and other sectors contribute the remaining 20%. In 1976 GNP
per capita was about US$150, among the lowest in East Africa.
1.04      At the Comoros' independence in 1975, France, the principal source
of financial and technical assistance, suspended such aid and most of the
French community departed, causing an immediate adverse impact on the economy.
Tentative estimates indicate that GDP reached a peak of US$71 million in
1974, having grown at 6 to 7% p.a. in real terms over the previous 5 years,
but fell 13% in 1975 and 9% in 1976. Following independence, the new state
made drastic cutbacks on most activities, and total public expenditures were
halved. Worldwide appeals for help brought the assistance of about US$20
million in suppliers' credits in 1976, mostly from Arab sources and China.



-2-
But in 1977, with the almost total exhaustion of all financial assistance and
the commitment of nearly all Treasury reserves, the budgetary situation became
critical. Because of the limits of local resources, the Government had to
reduce its expenditures further:, particularly administrative expenses that had
been absorbing most of the budget. The Comoros' budgetary problems are now
critical and will sharply restrict any Government contribution to development
projects.
Effects on Transport
1.05      The Comoros' geographic position makes transport difficult and ex-
pensive. Its international trade and communications are constrained by long
distances to foreign markets and by the lack of a natural deepwater harbor
for oceangoing vessels, the latter necessitating the use of "neighboring"
countries' ports for transshipments, or loading/unloading ships offshore.
As a result, higher-value imports and exports are carried by air. As part
of an archipelago, each island requires port and airport facilities, but even
though one island has international standard facilities, other islands remain
dependent on transshipments. Coastal shipping is impeded by the rocky coast-
line with only a few beaches. Intra-island transport is hampered by the
islands' rugged topography, steep gradients, clayish soils and heavy rains,
which make road construction expensive. All transport, but sea traffic in
particular, is often disrupted by cyclones during the rainy season.
B. The Transport System
1.06      The transport infrastrUcture in the Comoros comprises 2 ports,
4 airports, and about 700 km of roads, but no railway system or navigable
rivers.
Ports and Sea Transport
1.07      The Comoros have two ports, which can accommodate only small
oceangoing vessels. Mutsamudu, on the island of Anjouan, is the main port
of the Comoros. Its jetty (250 m long by 8 m wide) has a low tide capacity
to accommodate simultaneously two 500-ton coasters and various dhows. The
port of Moroni on Grande Comore has a quay (150 m long by 15 m wide) which
can accommodate coasters of up to 400 tons. At both ports, larger vessels
must anchor offshore for loading and unloading, which is possible in calm
weather only. Moheli has no port, but the beach at Fomboni permits the
handling of small boats and landing craft tankers during low tide.
1.08      Larger ships only occasionally call at the Comoros, but 10 to 12
coasters of 300-400 tons capacity operate regularly. In addition, 50-60
dhows of 5-30 tons capacity operate for lighterage and inter-island traffic.
Government owns three landing craft tankers and a number of dhows, and has a
minority participation in the Societe Comorienne de Navigation, a shipping
company with regular services to La Reunion, Mombasa in Kenya and Majunga



- 3 -
in Madagascar. The Compagnie Malgache de Cabotage also ensures shipments
between Majunga and the Comoros.
1.09      The annual volume of international sea freight is about 50,000
tons of imports and 10,000 tons of exports, about 25,000 tons of which are
transshipped at Majunga. Inter-island transport by boat annually comprises
about 6,000 tons of freight but only about 3,000 passengers (compared to
about 17,000 passengers by aircraft), since all sea transport is done by
unscheduled cargo vessels. Government has recently acquired a landing craft
tanker with facilities for 400 passengers, and thereby inter-island passenger
travel by sea is expected to increase.
Airports and Civil Aviation
1.10      The four airports provide adequate service.  Grande Comore has
two airports: the older one can accommodate Boeing 737s, has satisfactory
terminal buildings, and is used mainly for domestic flights. The new inter-
national airport, constructed in 1974/75 with financing by the French ad-
ministration, handles international flights, although airport lighting and
navigational aids are still lacking, and the runway needs considerable repair
because of faulty construction. When these problems are solved, the older
airport will be closed. Anjouan has one airport that can handle Boeing 737s,
while that of Moheli is somewhat smaller and without terminal facilities;
both runways need resurfacing.
1.11      Tanzania Airways operates scheduled flights with 737s between the
Comoros and Dar es Salaam. Air Comores, a fully Government-owned company
since Air France withdrew in 1976, also operates some international flights
but mainly serves inter-island needs.   Air Comores owns three DC4s and plans
to acquire a Boeing 737. In addition, an aeroclub at Moroni provides charter
flights.
1.12      During 1976, 1,745 landings disembarked about 22,000 passengers
and 760 tons of freight, more than half at Grande Comore. Of this, less
than 20% was international traffic, which decreased following the French
administration's departure.
Roads and Road Traffic
1.13      Details of the road subsector are given in Chapter 2.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
1.14      The Ministry of Finance, Economy and Planning (MFEP) through its
Directorate of Planning is responsible, inter alia, for national trans-
port policy, planning and coordination. The Government prepared a five-
year investment plan for the years 1978-82 in which improvement of transport



-4-
infrastructure and services is given high priority. One objective is the
construction of a deepwater berth at Anjouan's port of Mutsamudu to accom-
modate oceangoing vessels and thereby to eventually facilitate the country's
foreign trade and lessen its dependence on Madagascar; the economic viability,
however, seems marginal and is being reviewed. Equal priority is given to
upgrading the road network, to the extent possible, simultaneously on all
three islands, in order to help rural development and agricultural production.
Other aims comprise the construction of a small port on Moheli, completion of
the international airport and improvement of domestic airfields. Rather than
prepare a transport development program, Government stresses the need to
prepare specific projects suitable for foreign financial assistance, which is
crucial if it is to achieve its development objectives in the near future.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has agreed to finance techni-
cal assistance for project preparation, and further, has proposed arranging a
meeting of aid agencies to discuss project financing. The new Government of
the Comoros, which was instatecl in May 1978, is in the process of reviewing
this plan and, while some modifications are expected, Government has already
reaffirmed that improvement of the transport infrastructure is a high priority
for the country.
1.15      Since transport on the islands is restricted to roads, modal coor-
dination is not important and necessary only for inter-island traffic carried
by sea and air. Government adequately handles this need through its partici-
pation in the related transport companies, and its decisions on infrastructure
development. Government does not, however, intend to monopolize transport
services and would welcome foreign and local capital investment in the sector.
D. Past Bank Group Involvement
1.16      The Comoros became a Bank member in December 1976 and joined the
Association in December 1977. The Bank sent a mission to survey the economy
in December 1976, and during subsequent discussions with Government, it became
clear that agriculture and improvement of the transport infrastructure were
crucial to the country's development. Agricultural missions have since been
sent from the Regional Mission in Eastern Africa (RMEA), and as a result one
export crop improvement project is being prepared and a rural development
project has been identified.
1.17      A transport sector mission visited the country in March 1977 and
identified this road construction project. UNDP was approached and agreed
to finance the required detailed engineering study. Thereafter, and in view
of cofinancing possibilities, the project's scope was expanded during appraisal
in October 1977, and US$80,000 were made available under the Project Prepara-
tion Facility (PPF) to further detail the proposed new components. Appendix I
gives a list of documents and available data relating to the project.
1.18      This will be the first Bank Group project in the country.

2. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01       The road network comprises about 340 km of paved roads, 375 km of
mainly dry-weather earth roads and a number of tracks (Annex 2.1). Although
there is as yet no road classification system, Government has agreed to
introduce such a system before the end of 1978. The network is inadequate,
and large portions of the country are inaccessible during the rainy season.
Because of the rugged terrain, gradients of more than 10 degrees, having more
than 10 curves per kin, are common on many roads. Roadway widths, including
shoulders, are less than 7 m, which is adequate for the low traffic volumes.
Road conditions, particularly those of earth roads,2are poor, due to lack of
proper maintenance. Road density is about 380 in/km , which is high compared
to other African countries.
B. Traffic Growth and Characteristics
2.02       It is estimated that in 1977, the vehicle fleet consisted of about
1,650 vehicles, 90% of which were small and medium-size cars and some 10%
trucks, mainly of the 3.5-5.0 ton range. There are no buses. Vehicle weight
and dimension regulations are in line with French regulations, the maximum
permissible axle load being 13 tons. Although there is no enforcement agency,
the largest trucks are of the 5 ton range and are not overloaded. Since the
present vehicle weight regulations are not suited to conditions prevailing
in the country, Government agreed to take the measures necessary to limit the
maximum permissible axle load to 8 tons before the end of 1978. About 83% of
the fleet is used on Grande Comore (reflecting the presence of the central
Government), 15% on Anjouan and only 2% (about 30 vehicles) on Moheli. Th
fleet has increased by about 11% p.a. since 1970 (Annex 2.2); similarly,
gasoline consumption increased by about 11% p.a. during 1967-73 (Annex 2.3).
Overall, there is one vehicle for every 200 persons. Maximum traffic volume
is about 250 vehicles per day (vpd) on the paved roads near Moroni and about
200 vpd on the main road sections on Anjouan. Traffic counts are made only
sporadically for certain roads during preinvestment studies; however, Govern-
ment agreed to take annual traffic counts on roads classified as "major,"
starting in 1979.
2.03       Prior to the Government reorganization in mid-1977, the Ministry
of Public Works and Energy was responsible for annual vehicle licensing and
for the quarterly inspection of vehicles for hire, to determine their road-
worthiness. The vehicle registration system was discontinued at the coun-
try s independence, but Government has agreed to reestablish such a system by
December 31, 1979, under the responsibility of the newly created Ministry for
Equipment, Improvement of Territory and Quality of Life (NEITQL, para. 2.05).



- 6 -
Government establishes passenger and small load rates for the collective taxis
that operate in the main cities and on the all-weather rural roads; official
fares are strictly adhered to. Fares take road conditions into account, and
when roads are upgraded fares are reduced to ensure that operating cost
reductions are passed on to passengers (Annex 2.4). There are no official
truck haulage rates, since most trucks are privately or Government-owned.
C. Administration
2.04      For two years after independence in 1975, Government maintained
the former French administrative institutions, although with a reduced tech-
nical staff since French expatriates were recalled. Road administration was
then the responsibility of the Directorate of Public Works, under the Ministry
of Public Works and Energy, with one Subdivision on each island. In mid-1977
Government abolished all ministries, dismissed most of its staff, and adopted
a new administrative structure, emphasizing decentralization and retaining
only a reduced central authority. Following the change in Government in May
1978, the country has reverted to an administrative structure similar to that
in operation prior to 1977.
2.05      MEITQL is now in charge of public works.  MEITQL's Directorate of
Equipment and Improvement of Territory (DEIT) administers all matters relating
to road infrastructure, gives technical advice to local administrations, pre-
pares minor designs for civil works and buildings through its Technical Studies
Division and awards and follows up on civil works contracts, including those
for procurement of equipment. DEIT's Road Maintenance Division has three sub-
sections, one for each of the three islands, which are in charge of road
maintenance and minor construction works done by force account (Annex 2.5).
The 55 local communities carry out maintenance and construction of minor rural
roads with self-help. The DEIT operates one main workshop at the major
town of each island.
2.06      In order to assist Government to set up an effective administrative
structure for road maintenance, consultants' services were provided under the
PPF to identify Government organizational requirements (paras. 1.17 and 3.10).
Consultants' recommendations, which were ready in March 1978, were discussed
with Government and agreement was reached on an implementation program for
reorganizing the administration of road maintenance.
2.07      The Government of the Comoros is now completely dependent on its own
local staff for highway-related matters and faces a severe shortage of trained
and experienced staff at nearly all levels. Engineers and technicians are in
short supply and only one engineer has substantial experience in civil engineer-
ing. There are no mechanical engineers or economists in the country; quali-
fied mechanics and equipment operators are scarce. As a result, the Comoros
will depend heavily on foreign expertise in the near future.



D. Training
2.08      The Comoros have no training facilities for the specialties required
for road related activities. Only a few Comorians have completed technical
studies in Madagascar, France and the USSR. Civil works contractors and
engineering consultants have trained a few equipment operators, mechanics
and surveyors on-the-job; however, their impact on improving skills has been
rather limited. The small number of trained staff required in the various
specialties does not warrant a training school. In order to help Government
meet its most urgent needs, the proposed project includes technical assistance
for on-the-job training of local staff (para. 3.11), and fellowships for
essential training of higher level staff (para. 3.13). Technical assistance
(Chief of Workshops and mechanics), will also be provided by the Kuwait Fund
(para. 2.24).
E. Planning
2.09      Government's plan for the road subsector gives priority to the con-
struction of all-weather roads on each of the islands. A development program
was issued in February 1978, and feasibility and preliminary engineering
studies for a number of the planned road improvements were completed under
the French administration. 1/ Two of these roads are included in the proposed
project which will finance the construction to paved standards of part of the
Nioumakele circular road on Anjouan island (para. 3.03) and studies to prepare
for construction of part of the Moheli circular road (paLra. 3.14).
F. Financing
2.10      Prior to independence, the major part of expenditures on transport
infrastructure was financed by foreign sources, mainly France and the European
Development Fund (EDF). France's Fonds d'Investissements pour le Developpement
Economique et Social (FIDES) was the main contributor, from 1970 to 1974 com-
mitting CF 528 million (about US$2.2 million) for new road construction. The
former Ministry of Public Works and Energy's local budget provided an annual
average of CF 12 million (about US$50,000 equivalent) for new road construc-
tion, and CF 40 million (about US$163,000 equivalent) for maintenance over the
period. Local funds were essentially revenues from the tax on gasoline, which
were allocated to a Road Fund earmarked for road improvement.
1/   On Grande Comore:  Itsikoudi-Bandamagi (30 km); Dembeni-Nioumadzaha
(20 km); M'Vouni-La Convalescence (16 km).  On Anjouan:  Moya-M'Remani
(17 km); Nioumakele circular road (30 km).  On Moheli: Fomboni-Hoani-
Miringoni (25 km).



-8-
2.11      Following independence, the cessation of French aid interrupted
three road construction projects. In 1976, however, the Kuwait Fund provided
CF 1,300 million (about US$5.3 million) to complete these works and in 1977
financed an additional CF 96 million (about US$0.4 million) for road mainte-
nance equipment. Also, in 1977, EDF committed CF 230 million (almost US$1
million) for procurement of equipment for a road improvement unit. Local
funds for roads, however, have fallen sharply due to the reduced Government
income during the past two years. In 1977 the Road Fund was abolished and no
local allocation was made for new investments. The road maintenance budget
was considerably reduced, partly reflecting the reduction in staff positions
under the new administrative structure and partly reflecting the cut in staff
salaries to half their previous levels. The last quarterly budget of 1977 for
road maintenance and administration was about CF 2.2 million (about US$9,000)
at the central level and an unidentified part of CF 16.5 million (about
US$67,000), the total budget for the local administrations.
2.12      Financial resources of the Government are expected to remain inade-
quate for the near future, and the country will continue to depend on foreign
financing for new construction and highway maintenance. Nevertheless, Govern-
ment has agreed to re-establish the Road Fund for road maintenance purposes
by the end of 1978 in order to ensure, following project completion, adequate
financing from domestic resources of its road improvement and maintenance
program. The proposed project will finance the foreign and part of the local
cost of building up the road maintenance capacity over a three-year period
(para. 3.07) to preserve investments until Government is able to finance the
road maintenance budget locally.
G. Engineering
2.13      The DEIT's Study Section, staffed with one engineer, two topographers
and three draftsmen, undertakes minor designs. Feasibility and engineering
studies of larger projects are beyond the Study Section's capacity and will
continue to be done by consultants. There are no domestic consultant firms;
one foreign consultancy firm, Societe d'Etudes de Construction de Maisons et
Ouvrages (SECMO, France), is already established in the Comoros, and another,
Bureau Central pour les Equipements d'Outre-Mer (BCEOM, France), is consider-
ing opening an office in Moroni if potential work justifies it.
2.14      Having no soils laboratory, Government relies on consultants for
soil tests for studies and supervision of construction works. Government has
building facilities for a laboratory but lacks the equipment and technical
staff to carry out tests. The proposed project will assist Government in
establishing its own soils laboratory through financing of equipment (para.
3.09).  Government has agreed to obtain, by January 1, 1979, technical assis-
tance from bilateral sources for a qualified and experienced soils engineer to
head the soils laboratory and to train local staff.



2.15      Engineering standards follow French design praLctices and are ade-
quate for the traffic levels. Alignments of improved roads generally follow
existing tracks to take advantage of their earthworks arid drainage structures.
The latter consist of concrete pipes and box culverts; for the more important
crossings, reinforced concrete bridges are used, with spans ranging from 4 to
7 m. Bituminous pavements consist of a double bituminous surface treatment
on a 10-15 cm granular base; pavement widths are adequate, ranging from 3.5 m
on older roads to 5.0 m on newer roads. Appropriate design standards for the
various road classifications have been drawn up by consualtants under the PPF.
These standards will be reviewed and agreed with Govermnent during project
implementation.
H. Construction
2.16      Despite the rather low standards, road construction is expensive
(US$150,000-200,000 per km of paved road) for two main reasons. First, the
difficult terrain and heavy earthworks, adverse soil co,nditions and torrential
rains necessitate bituminous pavements in most places to prevent washing away
of the road; second, mobilization costs are high in relation to the small
scale of works. The foreign exchange component in road construction is high
since equipment and most materials and staff, except for unskilled labor, are
imported.
2.17      Major construction works are carried out by fEoreign contractors; two
contractors, with headquarters in Madagascar and France, are presently estab-
lished in the Comoros. Equipment can be imported duty-free on a temporary
basis, although with considerable delivery time; there are no restrictions on
remittances abroad by contractors. Construction supervision is carried out
by consultants but is the administrative responsibility of DEIT. Government
has no capacity for major works, but the EDF is financing equipment for a road
improvement unit to undertake upgrading of tracks to all-weather standards.
The proposed project will provide for financing of the unit's operating costs
(spare parts, imported fuel and materials) and technical assistance over a
three-year period to ensure the unit's efficient operation (para. 3.06).
2.18      There is no domestic road contractor or prospects for one in the
near future, due to lack of capital and skilled staff. Promotion of domestic
contractors would therefore be premature under this project but should be
considered under a next highway project. The local communities carry out
minor road improvements using labor-intensive techniques.
I. Road Maintenance
2.19       As already mentioned (para. 2.05), the Road Maintenance Section of
DEIT is responsible for overall road maintenance activities, equipment procure-
ment and repair of equipment at the three regional workshops, and assisting
the local communities with minor road improvements, mainly track upgrading.



- 10 -
2.20       Government lacks the capacity to identify equipment and spare part
needs, staffing and training requirements; no road inventory has been made.
The financial requirements and a program for annual maintenance operations
have not been estimated by Government, partly because funds would not be
available anyway. Equipment-intensive maintenance is virtually nonexistent
since Government's equipment pool, limited to a few dump trucks, two patching
trucks, rollers and some minor equipment, does not allow the formation of
mechanized brigades. As a resuLt, maintenance is mainly done by labor-
intensive methods. Villagers are recruited and supplied with shovels, picks
and wheelbarrows when available, generally to patch uneven or rocky surfaces
and to clear culverts and drains,. Recently, local youth organizations have
also improved some tracks. These efforts, however, make no lasting improve-
ment, given the lack of adequate construction techniques to withstand the
heavy rains on the steep slopes.
2.21       Equipment repair facilities are also inadequate.  The main work-
shops at each island's major town, Moroni, Mutsamudu and Fomboni, lack essen-
tial equipment and tools and need improvement of buildings. Some minor repair
facilities do exist at the regional centers, but are ill-equipped and can do
only small works. Spare parts are depleted, and equipment remains idle even
when only minor repairs are needed. In addition, there are too few mechanics,
especially in Mutsamudu and Fomboni, and equipment operators are also scarce.
2.22       As a result, roads are in poor condition.  Earth roads and tracks
often become impassable during the rainy season. Bituminous paved roads
are still in acceptable driving condition because of their fairly recent
construction.  Even so, many sections of the paved roads have potholes and
broken edges and show signs of pavement fatigue. Severe road deterioration
is found on a 700 m section of the only road connecting western Anjouan with
the island's only harbor at Mutsamudu. As a result of wave action and
inadequate construction standards, the retaining walls of this coastal road
have partially collapsed and part of the road has been washed away. Present
traffic is about 200 vpd. If not repaired, the road will be completely
washed away and one-third of Anjouan's population cut off; the proposed
project will assist in the repair of this road section (para. 3.05).
2.23       The appraisal mission tentatively estimated that within the next
three years more than 50% of the paved roads (190 km) will require resurfac-
ing and partial widening of the pavement width to 5 m and most of the tracks
(374 km) will need to be upgradecl to all-weather gravel or, if necessary,
bitumen standards. Routine maintenance also needs strengthening to avoid
further deterioration of the road network.
2.24       In order to improve the present situation, the Kuwait Fund and
EDF have already made commitments for about US$1.4 million for equipment
(para. 2.11). Government has approached the Kuwait Fund for further assis-
tance to finance: three master mechanics to be attached to the regional
workshops in Moroni, Mutsamudu and Fomboni (para. 3.08) for three years each;
one expatriate mechanic for the road improvement unit for 18 months; and road

maintenance equipment and hand tools to strengthen the labor-intensive road
maintenance operations carried out by the local communities. The EDF has
provided trucks for the local communities and equipment which will be used
primarily for the creation of a road improvement unit. Further assistance
will be offered under the proposed project, which will aid Government in
identifying and implementing a three-year road maintenance and improvement
program (para. 3.06).

(a) Road Construction and Supervision
3.03       The proposed project provides for the construction to paved stand-
ards, and related supervision, of 20.4 km of the Nioumakele circular road
on the island of Anjouan, including: 15.7 km of main road, Ongoujou-M'Remani-
M'Ramani, with a 6 m formation width and 5 m bituminous pavement course; and
4.7 km of access roads (2.5 km from Antsahe to Dziani, and 2.2 km from Antsahe
to Niambamoro) with a 4.5 m formation width and 3.5 m bituminous pavement
course. Detailed engineering and bidding documents for construction are
being prepared by consultants (SECMO). UNDP is financing the study with the
Bank as executing agency. Design standards (Annex 3.1) are appropriate for
the traffic forecast over the lifetime of the road.
3.04       The Nioumakele region is one of the country's most densely popu-
lated areas (about 70,000 persons) and has agricultural potential. About
24,000 of its inhabitants are now served by only a track in very poor condi-
tion, having gradients often civer 15% and becoming impassable during the rainy
season. Traffic volume, now about 30 vpd in the dry season, is expected to
increase to 100 vpd after construction. The new alignment will follow the
existing track closely, with the necessary horizontal and vertical improve-
ments. The topography of this area is very rugged, the ground slopes being
as steep as 30 degrees to 40 degrees. Surface soils vary between those with
considerable plasticity in the flatter sections and rock, lava and occasional
basaltic formations in the steeper areas. Since rains are heavy, with yearly
averages of 2.5 m on the plateau and 1.5 m nearing sea level, paving is con-
sidered necessary to prevent washouts. The location of the proposed road
construction is shown on Map IBRD 13414.
(b) Road Improvement
3.05       A 700 m stretch of the coastal road near Mutsamudu required urgent
repairs (para. 2.22), namely: (i) an increase in the height and repair of the
the existing retaining wall along a section of about 500 m; (ii) new construc-
tion of about 200 m of retaining wall, and (iii) reconstruction of about 150 m
in length of the washed away sections of the road formation and pavement.
These works, which were recent;Ly completed (para. 3.22), would be financed
under the proposed Credit.
3.06       To allow year-round access to areas now cut off during the rainy
season, the project will provide for the improvement of about 120 km of
tracks to all-weather standards on the three islands over a three-year period
(1979-81). A road improvement unit with equipment financed by the EDF (para.
2.24) will be created to do the following: improvement of drainage through
construction of culverts, small bridges and ditches; earth works to improve
alignments; and the spreading of a 15 cm gravel layer. This unit is suffi-
cient for the required road improvements on all three islands; its equipment
composition is given in Annex 3.2. The proposed project will provide oper-
ating expenditures for spare parts, fuel and imported materials over the
project period, and technical assistance for the operation of the unit (para.
3.11). A list of roads to be improved will be determined by consultants under
the project's technical assistance component (para. 3.10) on the basis of a



- 19 -
detailed inventory of the road network and Government's; development plans;
the list will be agreed with Government during project implementation.
(c) Road Maintenance
3.07      To help Government improve routine and periodic maintenance of the
country's paved road network, the project includes the creation and operation
of two patching units and one resealing unit. This covers: procurement of
equipment, financing of operating expenditures for spare parts, fuel and
materials for these units over a three-year period (1979-81); provision of
*        a stock of spare parts for the remainder of Government's equipment, both
existing and new equipment to be procured with Kuwait Fund and EDF assistance;
and technical assistance for the operation of the units (para. 3.11). The
patching units will seal potholes and repair pavement edges; the resealing
unit will carry out periodic resealing and partial widening of the pavement
course to 5 m as required. It is expected that over the three-year program,
the resealing unit will cover about 190 km and patching operations will be
annually carried out on 250 km of paved roads. All otlner maintenance opera-
tions, both for paved and earth roads, will be carried out by labor-intensive
methods, with the help of technical assistance provided under the project and
by the Kuwait Fund. Equipment for this purpose is being provided by the
Kuwait Fund and EDF; operating costs will be financed by Government. The
composition of the resealing and patching units and the list of equipment to
be procured under the project are shown in Annexes 3.2 and 3.3.
(d) Workshops
3.08      The workshop buildings and offices of the three central workshops
at Moroni, Mutsamudu and Fomboni (para. 2.21) will be improved under the
project to allow efficient repair and maintenance of all road equipment.
The project will also provide for the required workshop equipment and tools,
and technical assistance for the workshop organization and operation (para.
3.11) to complement that provided by the Kuwait Fund (para. 2.24). A detailed
list of necessary workshop equipment and tools will be determined by consul-
tants employed under the project's technical assistance component and agreed
with Government during project implementation.
(e) Soils Laboratory Equipment
3.09      A soils laboratory will be established in Mcroni to carry out soils
and materials tests required for the road improvement and maintenance program,
road construction by contractors, and engineering studies. The project pro-
vides Government with financing for the soils laboratory equipment needed for
the work.
(f) Technical Assistance
3.10      Consultants BCEOM (France) financed under the PPF have specified
details of the proposed components listed above from (b) to (g) (para. 3.02).



- 20 -
Three specialists were employed for up to three months each: a highways engi-
neer to define a road improvement and maintenance program; an organization ex-
pert to review and make proposals for the roads organization; and a mechanical
engineer to define equipment and spare part requirements and workshop needs in
addition to preparing bidding documents for items to be procured under the
project. They have also evaluated local staff, technical assistance and
training needs.
3.11      Based on recommendations of consultants under the PPF, the proposed
project will finance about 126 months of technical assistance to implement the
road improvement and maintenance program and to train Comorian staff.   Five
consultants engaged for periods of 12 to 36 months plus various short-term
consultants for a total of 6 man-months will assist Government as follows:
(i) a highway engineer for three years, to head the consul-
tants' team, and be in charge of planning, coordination
and implementation of the road improvement and highway
maintenance program;
(ii)  a mechanical engineer for three years, to establish an
efficient system for equipment procurement and storage,
maintenance and repair;
(iii) a cost accountant for 12 months, to introduce a system
for budgeting and cost accounting for road maintenance
and improvement works, including equipment maintenance
and repair; and
(iv)  two construction foremen for 18 months each, to organize
and supervise operations of the road improvement and
maintenance units.
3.12       The consultants will coordinate their tasks with technical assis-
tance to be provided by the Kuwait Fund (para. 2.24). Although the country
will depend on technical assistance to operate and administer the highway
sector for some time to come, the proposed project will assist Government in
meeting its most urgent training needs. It is expected that on-the-job
training by consultants will provide lower and medium level Comorian staff
(mechanics, equipment operators, foremen, workshops chiefs) with the basic
knowledge to effectively carry out road improvement and maintenance opera-
tions; however, expatriates will continue to be needed for key positions.
(g) Fellowships
3.13       The project provides a lump sum for training abroad of higher
level Comorian staff. Consultants employed under the project (paras. 3.10-
3.11) will review training needs and determine the number of fellowships
required for specialized training. Fellowships will be agreed with Govern-
ment during project implementation.



- 21 -
(h) Studies
3.14      In order to prepare an eventual second highway project, the pro-
posed project includes: (a) detailed engineering for the 25 km Fomboni-Hoani-
Miringoni road on Moheli island, for which a feasibility study and preliminary
engineering have been completed, showing rates of return of 13% for the
Fomboni-Hoani section (10 km) and 8% for the Hoani-Miringoni section (15 km);
(b) a feasibility study, and if justified, detailed engineering for the con-
tinuing 20 km Miringoni-Nioumachoua section. The detailed engineering will
include the preparation of bidding documents suitable for International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) since the scope of construction works will be beyond
the capacity of the road improvement unit to be created under the project.
Terms of reference have been agreed with Government and are included in the
Project File (Appendix I, C.2).
3.15      In conjunction with roads to be constructed in the Nioumakele area
(para. 3.03), the project includes financing of preinvestment studies for an
integrated rural development project. The studies will include the necessary
surveys of the terrain, a hydrological survey, a population census and the
identification and quantification of the area's precise needs. Terms of
reference have been agreed with Government and are included in the Project
File (Appendix I, C.3).

3.17      The total project costs, estimated at May 1978 prices, were obtained
as follows:
(a)  Road construction:  based on AfDF and IDA estimates on
the basis of detailed engineering;
(b)  Construction supervision:  based on 24 man--months of
consultants' services at an estimated average cost of
about US$7,000 per man-month and found to be in line with
ongoing supervision contracts in Comoros;
(c)  Repair of Mutsamudu road:  contract cost, as proposed
by the lowest bidder, Societe Nationale des Travaux Publics
(SNTP, France) and approved by the Association in February
1978;
(d)  Equipment:  based on recent quotations obtained in Comoros
which reflect c.i.f. Moroni prices;
(e)  Spare parts, materials, fuel:  based on consultant esti-
mates under the PPF;
(f)  Salaries:  based on Government scales for local staff
and current international salary levels for consultants.
The billing rate of the consulting firm, net of tax and
contingencies, is an average of about US$5,500 per man-
month, covering salaries, overhead (home office expenses,
expatriate allowance, social security, and other indirect
expenses), and fees. Reimbursable expenses payable to
consultants average US$1,500 per field man-month, and
include housing, internal and external travel, telecom-
munications, report preparation, etc.;
(g)  Workshop repairs:  based on 1977 building costs for public
buildings in Comoros;
(h)  Studies:  costs for feasibility and engineering studies
of the Fomboni-Miringoni-Nioumachoua road are based on
costs for the ongoing detailed engineering study for the
Nioumakele road on the assumption of: (i) about 30 months
of engineering staff at about US$5,500 per man-month
covering salaries, overhead and fees plus about US$1,500
per field man-month of local expenditures for housing and
daily allowances; (ii) about 15 man-months of consultants
surveying staff recruited in neighboring countries at
about US$1,500 per man-month covering salaries, overhead,
fees and local expenditures; and (iii) costs for purchase
and operation of vehicles, soils and surveying equipment
and materials, international and inter-island travel,
office equipment and supplies, telecommunications and



- 24 -
report preparation, including salaries for draftsmen and
printing. The rural development preinvestment study is
based on the mission's estimate for similar projects in
neighboring countries.
D. Financing
3.18      An IDA Credit of US$5.0 million would be available towards project
financing. On August 18, 1978, the African Development Fund (AfDF) provided
a credit of US$4.5 million towards parallel cofinancing of the Nioumakele road
construction and supervision. On July 28, 1978, the OPEC Special Fund provided
US$1.0 million to finance part of the road improvement and maintenance program,
including equipment for one resealing and two patching units, part of the
technical assistance (one mechanical engineer and one foreman for resealing
brigade) and fellowships. Government has agreed to finance all local salaries.
Effectiveness of the IDA Credit will be conditional upon notification by the
OPEC Special Fund that all conditions precedent to the disbursement of the
OPEC Loan, except for the effectiveness of the IDA Credit, have been fulfilled.

3.19      In order to accelerate definition of the road improvement and main-
tenance component, US$80,000 have been made available under the PPF to finance
some initial consultant services (para. 3.10); this will be refinanced under
the proposed Credit. In addition, retroactive financing to cover the cost of
urgently needed repairs of the 700 m Mutsamudu road section, about US$140,000,
is recommended.
E. Implementation and Procurement
3.20      As agreed with Government, the MEITQL, through the DEIT, will be
responsible for overall project execution and, in particular, will be in
charge of overall planning and budgeting for road improvement and maintenance
operations. The DEIT's road maintenance division will be responsible for the
execution of maintenance and road improvement done by force account; it is also
responsible for maintenance and repair of equipment. The technical assistance
team under the project will operate in an advisory capacity within the DEIT;
its team leader will be responsible to DEIT for supervising the implementation
of the road improvement and maintenance programs.
3.21      Construction of the Nioumakele road will be let on a unit price
basis following ICB in accordance with AfDF's regulations. Construction is
expected to start in the first half of 1979 and be completed within 12 months;
supervision of construction will be carried out by consultants selected by
Government and employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the AfDF.
3.22      Repair of the Mutsamudu section was carried out under contract
following local bidding procedures since the scope of works did not warrant
ICB.  The two contractors now in the Comoros, who have satisfactorily com-
pleted similar works there, sulbmitted their bids in January 1978, and SNTP
(Madagascar), the lowest evaluated bidder, was awarded the contract. Work
started in March 1978 and is aLready completed.
3.23      Road improvement and maintenance works for paved roads will be
carried out by mechanized units on force account, which is the most economic
method for this type of work in the country. Consultants under the project's
technical assistance component will prepare a three-year road maintenance and
improvement work program. Government agreed to submit the program for the
Association's approval and, to take account of current developments, to submit
a yearly updated program for the Association's approval three months before
the beginning of each year's program. The DEIT Study Section will prepare
necessary work drawings and carry out engineering surveys for the works to
be executed; the soils laboratory to be created under the project will do
the necessary site investigations and soil tests. The road improvement and



- 27 -
resealing units will operate sequentially on all three islands following the
agreed work program. One patching unit will operate exclusively on Grande
Comore; the other will be established on Anjouan but will be transferred to
Moheli as warranted. Inter-island transportation will be undertaken with the
Government-owned landing craft tankers, which have ample capacity for such
service. The technical assistance team will help execute and supervise the
works, which are expected to start in late 1978, andl will ensure cost control
and efficiency of the units. Government has agreed to employ or assign the
qualified local personnel and counterparts required to implement the road
improvement and maintenance program, as shown in Annex 3.4. Upon completion
of the program under the project, the units will continue their work in line
with Government priorities.
3.24      Equipment and spare parts, workshop tools and equipment, and soils
laboratory equipment will be procured on the basis of negotiated contracts
following international shopping among potential suppliers in line with Bank
Group Guidelines. Government has agreed to this method of procurement which
has been found to be the most adequate, given (a) the small number of items to
be procured, (b) the need for standardization so that the equipment financed
under the project will complement that provided by EDF and the Kuwait Fund,
and (c) the total lack of response to international competitive bidding for
similar types of equipment needed under EDF-financed assistance. The list of
road maintenance equipment to be procured under the project, as agreed with
Government, is given in Annex 3.3; the requirements for spare parts and
workshop tools and equipment and soils laboratory equipment will be determined
by consultants during project implementation. DEIT, with the assistance of
consultants under the project, will be in charge of procurement.
3.25      Workshop buildings will be improved by force account or by local
building contractors following local procedures. Consultants under the
project's technical assistance component will outliLne required works and
method of execution to be agreed with Government during project implementa-
tion.
3.26      Technical Assistance and Studies.  As agreed with Government, con-
sultants for technical assistance as well as feasibility, detailed engineer-
ing and preinvestment studies will be selected by Government and employed on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association.
3.27      Completion of the project is expected by the end of 1981.  Govern-
ment has agreed to the implementation schedule given in Annex 3.5 and the
progress reporting system shown in Annex 3.6. Government also agreed to
submit to the Association a completion report within six months of project
termination.

F. Disbursements
3.28      A disbursement schedule for IDA funds is given in Annex 3.7.  The
IDA credit will finance 45% of the project costs, covering 100% of foreign
costs and all local costs of the selected components (except local salaries).
G. Ecology
3.29      The project is expected to have a favorable impact on the ecology.
The Nioumakele road, in particular, will facilitate access to soil conserva-
tion works to be undertaken under the rural development project on a seriously
eroded area of the plateau.

4. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits
4.01      The project is expected to yield benefits in several areas.  First,
it will assist in the establishment of an adequate road administration,
through an organization study, provision of technical assistance to implement
the study's recommendations and training of local staff on the job and abroad,
so that foreign experts will gradually be replaced by local staff. The in-
stitution building component accounts for about 15% of the project cost; no
economic rate of return calculation has been attempted. Second, the project
will help the administration to carry out a three-year road maintenance and
improvement program, through the financing of additional road equipment and
initial stocks of spare parts, fuel and other imported materials. This
project component accounts for about 40% of total costs, and is expected to
yield a 17% economic rate of return; benefits will be reductions in vehicle
operating costs and consequent reduced transport costs to both producers and
consumers. Third, the road construction element, about 40% of project costs,
will benefit one of the most densely populated and undeveloped areas, paving
the way for a planned rural integrated development project by which agricul-
ture net value added could increase as much as fivefold. The expected eco-
nomic rate of return would be about 12%, essentially dependent on the success
of the development project. Social benefits, which are expected to be con-
siderable, have not been included in the calculations because meaningful
quantification is virtually impossible at this stage; the project's overall
economic rate of return is about 13%.
B. Nioumakele Road Construction
4.02      The Nioumakele road was selected for improvement based on several
criteria. First, the relative priority of improving various road sections
was analyzed considering population of the areas of influence, agricultural
potential as compared to actual development, and the extent to which the
lack of an all-weather road appeared to be a main constraint to potential
development. The Institut de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales et des
Cultures Vivrieres (IRAT) has been conducting agricultural research in the
Comoros since 1964, and provided information on agricultural aspects, such
as present and probable yields (based on a soils survey), costs and prices
at various locations and marketing stages, consumption patterns, and effects
of previous road construction on production, marketing and prices in the
areas of influence. Second, for social and economic reasons, Government
gives top priority to development of the Nioumakele area which is one of the
most densely populated and backward regions in the country; Government has
requested assistance for this purpose from various agencies, and the EDF is



- 39 -
already carrying out a pilot project there. 1/ And th-ird, existing feasibility
studies for several roads (para. 2.09), which base their justification prim-
arily on vehicle operating savings, were also reviewed before choosing the
road to be constructed.
4.03      At present, the paved network linking the port and capital, Mutsamudu,
to eastern Anjouan ends at M'Remani (see Map IBRD 13414). The project will
assist in completing the all-weather connection to the southernmost part
of the island through financing construction of a 20.4 km section of the
Nioumakele-area circular road from Ongoujou to M'Ramani with spurs to Dziani
and Niambamoro. Although Government had requested financing for the whole
road length (30.3 km), construction of the most difficult and expensive 9 km
climbing from M'Ramani to Ongoujou is not justified at this time. 2/
4.04      The project road has an influence area of about 3,500 ha, of which
2,700 ha have agricultural potential. Population of the road area in 1977
was some 24,000, growing at about 3.5% p.a. However, the area's population
may now be as high as 30,000 since many of the 18,000 persons recently re-
patriated from Madagascar (para. 1.02) were originally from Nioumakele and
have returned thereto. Land pressure is among the highest in Comoros, about
10 persons per hectare of agricultural land. Although only traditional
low-yield techniques are used, agriculture is the main livelihood, providing
about US$15 per capita a year. Malnutrition is widespread.
4.05      There is scope for improving the area's agricultural production,
provided assistance is given. Crops grown at present are mainly for sub-
sistence: rice, manioc, potatoes, bananas, coconuts and some vegetables.
due to land pressure, soil erosion is spreading. According to IRAT, the
present net average yield per hectare is about US$150, but could be doubled
by simply introducing improved agricultural methods and increased as much as
fivefold with intensive export crop cultivation (e.g., ylang-ylang, pepper,
vanilla, coffee). This, however, would require extension services and provi-
sion of inputs, and an all-weather road to permit access and crop extraction.
The EDF considers it urgent to begin controlling erosion in the area and is
therefore starting a pilot project introducing terracing of steep slopes, tree
1/   The French administration has also recognized the need to develop this
area, in the 1971 "Etude de l'Amenagement de la presqu'ile de Nioumakele",
Bureau pour le Developpement de la Production Agricole (BDPA), and in
the 1974 "Etude d'Identification du Projet de Developpement Economique
Integre du Nioumakele a Anjouan propose au financement des Nations Unies",
Ministere de Developpement Rural, although no action was taken in that
respect.
2/   This section traverses an intensely eroded and unpopulated slope in
need of soil conservation works such as afforestation, which can be
undertaken upon completion of contiguous road sections. In addition,
when the network is developed in the future, it will probably prove
more useful to construct a coastal road from M'Ramani to Domoni, giving
a more direct and flatter road connection with the north.



- 40 -
planting and construction of drainage ditches, water tanks and some feeder
roads. However, more comprehensive action is required, and the project is
therefore financing preinvestment studies for an integrated rural development
project, with implementation scheduled to start by the time the project road
is completed.
4.06      The economic analysis (Annex 4.1) is based on an assessment of
costs and benefits with and without the proposed road construction to paved
standards over 20 years, the estimated economic life of the road. The invest-
ment cost is taken as the net of tax cost of the road improvement, including
supervision and physical contingencies. Traffic volume on the road may rise
from its present 30 vpd to 100 vpd after completion of construction, as
happened elsewhere in Comoros.
4.07      Since the road alone may not trigger agricultural development, its
economic return is evaluated as a combined road construction-rural development
project. Until results of the preinvestment study become available, the net
agricultural value added which is used in the analysis is only illustrative,
based on IRAT estimates. Depending upon the timing of agricultural improve-
ments and the type of agricultural methods adopted, the economic rate of
return ranges between a conservative 8% and a probable 12%; benefits will
mainly accrue to agricultural producers in the project area. Ultimately,
some US$400,000 of yearly food imports (at 1978 prices) could be avoided, or
export revenues increased. Social benefits to be derived from the road have
not been quantified but are expected to be considerable, given the conditions
prevailing in Nioumakele. In addition, road maintenance costs will be reduced
since it will no longer be necessary to reopen the road each year after the
rainy season.
C. Road Improvement and Maintenance
4.08      The economic analysis of the road improvement and resealing and
patching units is based on an assessment of costs and benefits expected with
and without the proposed project over a seven-year period, taken to be the
lifespan of the equipment procured under the project; the overall economic
rate of return for these activities is about 17%. Quantified benefits are
vehicle operating savings, considering present and projected traffic volumes.
The investment cost is taken as the net of tax cost of the improvement and
maintenance works and includes procurement of equipment and spare parts
(including the EDF and Kuwait Fund equipment contributions), repairs of
workshop buildings, procurement of workshop and laboratory equipment, and
technical assistance directly attributable to the units. IDA would provide
about 70% of the program's cost over the first three years. Other benefits
such as road user time savings and better access to social facilities have
not been quantified.
4.09      The rate of return expected for the improvement unit is 12% (Annex
4.2). The unit would annually upgrade about 40 km of track to all-weather
standards; with adequate routine maintenance and periodic regravelling, the



- 41 -
improvement work would have a 10 year economic life, ander the conditions pre-
vailing in the Comoros. The improvement cost would be about US$15,000 per km 1/
and would eliminate the need for reopening the tracks following each rainy
season, at an actual cost of some US$1,500 per km. In addition, traffic would
increase as a result of the year-round serviceability, to about 30 vpd in the
opening years and growing thereafter at about 15% p.a. (only 4 vpd in the
first years as compared to 11% or an average of about 11 vpd for main road
traffic growth). Vehicle operating savings of normal traffic, which consists
of pick-ups during the dry season, would be in the order of US$0.14/vehicle-km.
4.10      The rate of return estimated for the resealing and patching units
is about 34%. The benefit cost ratio discounted at L0% is 2.6:1 (Annex 4.3).
Resealing of about 70 km of roads and patching of about 250 km as necessary
would be carried out annually. Resealing would be repeated every 7 years,
but roads are assumed to remain in good condition with adequate maintenance
and patching. Without this project component, the paved roads would deter-
iorate and probably need reconstruction in five to ten years; however, the
avoided reconstruction cost has not been included in the benefits, which
reflect only vehicle operating savings. An average of 100 vpd on the paved
roads has been assumed for 1980, and growing thereafter at 5% p.a. Average
vehicle operating saving per km derived from the resurfacing has been esti-
mated at US$0.05 in 1980, and increasing to US$0.12 in 1990 when reconstruc-
tion would be needed if no maintenance is carried out.
D. Studies
4.11      Detailed engineering.  In 1972 BCEOM (France) completed a feasi-
bility study which concluded that construction of the Fomboni-Hoani road
section (10 km) would yield an economic rate of return of about 13%; a 1974
study by SECMO (France) found that the Hoani-Miringoni section (15 km) would
yield a return of about 8%. The area of influence is already planted exten-
sively with coconut palms, the exploitation of which is hindered by lack of
access to the Fomboni "port;" the forthcoming IDA export crop improvement
project to be appraised in 1979, will cover, inter alia, this area, and would
improve the road construction justification. The project would finance the
detailed engineering for both sections, leaving the BCEOM alignment for the
first section to take advantage of the existing structures. The extension
of this road from Miringoni to Nioumachoua (20 km) traverses difficult, moun-
tainous terrain. It is the missing link to complete a circular road to
Fomboni, but at present the existing track is too poor to permit vehicle
traffic.  A feasibility study and, if justified, detailed engineering will
be financed under the project.
4.12      Preinvestment study.  The project includes the required studies
for the integrated rural development project proposed for the Nioumakele
area (para. 4.05).
1/   Whether some road sections will need a bitumen pavement will be deter-
mined during the execution of works; the additional cost would be
justified by a considerable extension of the economic life.

E. Risks
4.13      There are no major technical risks involved in the project, and
provisions have been made for an adequate preparation to minimize subsequent
project implementation delays which would increase costs and postpone bene-
fits. However, since this is the Comoros' first Bank Group-financed project,
Government may face some difficulties with Bank Group procedures and with
the recruitment of necessary consultants financed under the project. Further-
more, a shortage of local fund[s for financing of even the small portion of
local cost required under the project is another risk. However, performance
during project preparation has been very satisfactory, and the implementation
schedule adopted seems realistic. To minimize these risks, close supervision
during project implementation will be undertaken.
4.14      Sensitivity analysis has been carried out considering the risk of
lower than expected benefits; results of that analysis are still generally
satisfactory. Should lower than expected traffic growth and/or unit vehicle
operating savings reduce benefits by 20%, the rate of return of the resealing
and patching component would be about 28%, and of the improvement component,
10%. However, should the rural integrated development project planned for
the Nioumakele area be postponed, the rate of return for the related road
construction could be as low as 8%.

1/ Avoided yearly track reopening, at an estimated US$ 1,500/km, less
about US$ 300/km for routine maintenance of improved road, and US$
400/km each five years for regravelling. The unit would improve
30 km the first year, and 40 km p.a. thereafter, with a 10 year
economic life.
2/ Assuming 30 vpd in opening years and a 15% traffic growth p.a.;
that normal traffic (pick-ups in dry season) operating costs would
decrease from US$ 0.34 to 0.20 on a good gravel road; that half the
traffic would be generated, with half the normal traffic savings.

1/ Estimated as US$ 200/km above level without project.
2/ Vehicle operating savings were derived assuming that the units would
improve 50 km the first year and 70 km p.a. thereafter; that average
traffic on paved roads would be 100 vpd in 1980 and increasing at
5% p.a.; that the saving per vehicle/km would increase from US$ 0.05
in 1980 to US$ 0.12 irL 1989, considering a paved network deteriorating
increasingly without the project until 1990, when it should be re-
constructed. Vehicle operating costs per km on good paved roads would
be as follows, in US$: small car, 0.08; medium size car or pick-up,
0.11; 3.5 ton truck, 0.26; and average given the traffic composition,
0.12.
