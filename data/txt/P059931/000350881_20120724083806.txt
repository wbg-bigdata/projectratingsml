F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

  (a) Water allocation, water quality and water conservation improved in Project basins, and
river infrastructure better maintained, through strengthened capacity for planning and
management; and investments;
  (b) Sector governance enhanced, and sector fiscal sustainability strengthened, nationally,
and in Project basins, through setting up Water Resources Councils; ensuring stakeholder‟s



                                                ii
involvement; unbundling of operational tasks, and Private Sector Participation; and improved
cost recovery; and
  (c) Increased agricultural productivity and improved performance of irrigation, based on
participatory irrigation management, through setting up and strengthening WUAFs;
strengthening restructured Dinas PUP of local government; financing rehabilitation and
improvement of existing irrigation schemes; and facilitating access to agricultural support
services and micro-credit.

The project development objective stated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) is as
follows: The objective of the Project is to assist the Borrower in attaining a strengthened
water resources sector by improving the performance of its water resources and irrigation
sector, and rehabilitating and upgrading the infrastructure of the said sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

There is no revision of project development objectives in the course of project
implementation. There are some discrepancies between the monitoring indicators of the DCA
and those of the PAD. As per advice of the Operations Support Team of the EAP Sustainable
Development Department, the indicators from the PAD were used for reporting below.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1     Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    Country and sector background: Water resources and irrigation management plays an
important role in Indonesia‟s socio-economic development in terms of food security since
most grain production is from irrigated areas. Development of water resources and irrigation
between the 1970s and mid 1980s focused on achieving and maintaining self sufficiency in
rice after a period of serious food shortages. During five consecutive five-year plan periods
starting in 1969, some 2.5 million hectares of irrigation areas were rehabilitated and 1.7
million hectares of new areas were developed. River basin management was mainly seen as a
requirement for securing irrigation supply and flood protection. Such efforts were supported
by massive expansion and farm input programs leading to self sufficiency in rice in 1984.
1.1.2 However, the government could not maintain rice self-sufficiency after that. One of
the main reasons was the lack of attention to and funding for operation and maintenance
(O&M) of the newly rehabilitated and developed irrigation systems. The subsequent rapid
deterioration of the physical systems resulted in frequent and premature rehabilitation or
deferred maintenance of the infrastructure. In the late 1990s it became clear that such a supply
driven approach led to unsustainable use of water resources and poor cost recovery.
1.1.3 In response to the financial crisis, the government embarked in 1998 on a process of
democratization and decentralization. This also involved reform of the water resources and
irrigation sector aiming at devolution and unbundling of management responsibilities to
provincial and district governments. It introduced stakeholder participation to enhance
sustainable management of the resource and infrastructure, and put more emphasis on demand
responsive and decentralized service delivery.
1.1.4 These reforms were fully supported by the Bank. The Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) (2001) had three main objectives, (a) promoting broad-based growth; (b) building
national institutions for accountable government;, and (c) delivering better public services to
the poor, including support to local governments that put reform into practice. The WISMP
program and this first phase project contributed substantially to objectives (b) and (c) of the
CAS.
1.1.5 Rationale for Bank Assistance: After the 1997/98 financial crisis, the Bank played a
leadership role through its support to the regulatory reform (Water Resources Sector
Adjustment Loan (WATSAL, Ln. 4469-IND) (1999 - 2003)) and the large-scale field pilot of
new institutional arrangements for irrigation and basin water resources management (Java
Irrigation Improvement and Water Management Project (JIWMP, Ln. 37624) (1995 - 2002)
and Indonesia Water and Irrigation Reform Implementation Project (IWIRIP, TF 29896)
(2001 - 2004) resulting in a new Law on Water Resources in 2004. Other donors were also
actively supporting the reform process, leading to the formation of the Donor Water
Resources Sector Support Group in October 2000. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), which both held larger water resources
portfolios than the bank, increasingly adopted the principles and concepts emerging from
JIWMP and WATSAL. As a result, both ADB and JBIC harmonized their own project
designs, culminating in the ADP Participative Irrigation Project (PISP) and participatory
approaches in JBIC loans for small-scale irrigation management projects. The Government of
Indonesia‟s intention was to implement these reforms in the decade up to 2014. Due to its
deep involvement in WATSAL and the other projects piloting the reforms, the Bank was well
positioned to support WISMP to implement and further the sector reforms. Furthermore, the
Bank‟s long-standing involvement in Indonesia‟s water sector provided a sound basis for
project design, in particular sequencing priorities and benefiting from earlier project
implementation experiences.

1.1.6 When GOI and the European Union (EU) decided to undertake a project with similar
institutional reform goals with more poverty focus in the province of Nusa Tenggara Barat
(NTB), it was agreed that the EU grant could best be administered by the Bank. In addition to
increasing the geographic coverage of the WISMP water sector reforms, it was in line with
the on-going Good Governance in Water Resource Management Project (GGWRMP)
financed by EU and covering three river basins (respectively in DI Yogyakarta, East Java and
Lampung).

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

1.2.1 The WISMP was designed as a twelve-year adaptable program loan (APL). The
WISMP program objectives were as follows:
        (a) Sustainable and equitable management of surface water resources and their
        utilization infrastructure by: (i) transparent sector governance institutions and, (ii)
        more accountable and better performing sector agencies;
        (b) Increased irrigation farm household incomes and improved regional food security
        as a result of raising the overall productivity of irrigated agriculture and reducing its
        vulnerability to natural and economic shocks through: (i) sustainable participatory
        irrigation management for more reliable and equitable water provision and, (ii) better
        agricultural and marketing support services for members of irrigation water user
        associations; and
        (c) More cost-effective and fiscally sustainable management of sector agencies.


1.2.2 Within these overall program objectives the project development objectives of the
WISMP Phase I (WISMP1) were stated as follows:
        (a) Water allocation, water quality and water conservation improved in Project basins,
        and river infrastructure better maintained, through strengthened capacity for planning
        and management; and investments;
        (b) Sector governance enhanced, and sector fiscal sustainability strengthened,
        nationally, and in Project basins, through setting up Water Resources Councils
        (WRCs); ensuring stakeholder involvement; unbundling of operational tasks, and
        Private Sector Participation; and improved cost recovery; and
        (c) Increased agricultural productivity and improved performance of irrigation, based
        on participatory irrigation management, through setting up and strengthening Water
        User Association Federations (WUAFs); strengthening restructured Local
        Government Public Works Water Resources Departments (Dinas PUPs); financing
        rehabilitation and improvement of existing irrigation schemes; and facilitating access
        to agricultural support services and micro-credit.
All the triggers for WISMP to migrate to Phase II (WISMP2) were met satisfactorily and
WIMSP 2 loan was approved in 2011, and is now under implementation. This ICR covers
both the WISMP1 and NTB-WRMP projects as approved by the OPCS.


1.2.3. The NTB-WRMP had similar institutional reform objectives with a more clear focus
on poverty alleviation by being located in one of the poorest provinces of Indonesia over a
five year project period. The purpose of the Grant was to assist the Recipient in attaining a
strengthened water and irrigation sector in its Province of Nusa Tenggara Barat and in the
Kabupatens in the said province by improving the performance of the Province‟s and the
Kabupatens‟ water resources and irrigation sector, and rehabilitating and upgrading the
infrastructure of said sector.

1.2.4 The Key Indicators identified for the WISMP project were as follows (See details in
the Data Sheet):

Governance and Institutional Capacity-building:            National Water Council (NWC)
established and focusing on implementation of the National Water Policy (as a transitional
arrangement, the National Coordination Team (of Ministers) for Water Resources
Management is upgraded). Basin policy decisions and basin agency operations are transparent
and reviewed by provincial and basin councils or committees that include stakeholders
(including representation of the interests of women and vulnerable isolated indigenous
peoples). Irrigation schemes are governed by WUAFs in partnership with kabupatens via the
Komisi Irigasi, which have stakeholder representation. Water use rights system piloted for
more rational and fair water allocation and providing for in-stream needs.

Management Performance of Sector Agencies: Management audits show that kabupaten
agency assistance to WUAFs is participatory and effective, with Management Information
System (MIS) being maintained, hydrology operations improving, and National Water
Quality Monitoring Network operational in pilot sites.

Fiscal Sustainability of Sector: Cost recovery mechanisms for river infrastructure
maintenance identified and arrangements made for its implementation. Arrangements for fees
on effluent discharges and for water abstraction were operationalized in two basins. KIIF
funds disbursement on a matching basis under way.

(Initiation of) Integrated Approach to Irrigated Agriculture Support: Farmers use extension
services more regularly, raise income (i.e. increased farm incomes).

1.2.5 The Key Indicators for NTB-WRMP were analogous to those for WISMP and were
as follows (See details in the Data Sheet):

           (a) A Provincial Water Resources Council (PWRC) with appropriate stakeholder
           representation and its Secretariat established and functional;
           (b) Basin Water Resources Council (BWRC) established with appropriate
           stakeholder representation and functional;
           (c) Balai PSDA covering entire provincial territory established and operational
           with trained staff;
           (d) A Dinas PUP Surat Keputusan has been issued for role sharing in
           hydrometeorology between the relevant Dinas PUP and UPTD or Balai PSDA, and
           the hydromet network operational;
           (e) The provincial planning unit in Dinas PUP is established with appropriate
           staffing and funding, and starts producing strategic and master plans for provincial
           basins;
           (f) Quality Assurance Plans and infrastructure maintenance plans produced and
           being implemented;
           (g) At least 60,000ha of irrigation system is co-managed by WUAFs;
           (h) At least 160 WUAFs established in the 71 participating kabupaten;
           (i) At least 100 IMF funding proposals received by the Irrigation Commissions
           from WUAFs in the 7 Participating Kabupaten; and
           (j) At least 3 Participating Kabupaten provide from their APBD at least
           Rp60,000/ha O&M budget for their project schemes.

1.3     Revised PDO and Key Indicators

1.3.1    The WISMP PDO remained the same throughout implementation. The loan/credit for
the project was negotiated but the signing and effectiveness of the loan was delayed by two
years because government wanted to ensure consistency with the new law on water
resources only issued in 2004 (Law 7/2004). The consequent changes in the legal and
institutional environment required changes to some key outcome indicators which were
amended accordingly (as expressed in the restated Development Credit Agreement (DCA) of
2009, and shown in the ICR Data Sheet). The PDO for NTB-WRMP was unchanged during
implementation. The key outcome indicators were amended through the Grant Agreement, as
shown in the ICR Data Sheet.

1.4     Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1   The primary target population of WISMP comprised:

        (a) The water users in the Project‟s river basins in the 14 Project provinces, notably
        men and women farmers, urban and rural settlements, industries, and communities
        that depend for their livelihood on water from the rivers;
        (b) Men and women farmers, as well as landless laborers and by extension the rural
        population, in the Project areas, as they will benefit from better water availability and
        from programs to assist in strengthening the rural economy. As the Project intended
        to cover approximately 2.35 million ha of irrigated area, it would affect around 6.7
        million farmer households or 40 million rural dwellers that directly depended on
        irrigation, whilst an additional group‟s income in the rural space depended indirectly
        on the performance of irrigated agriculture;
        (c)The population on Java as food security and environmental quality will be
        improved; and
        (d) The communities living in the upper catchment areas in the Project areas and that
        would be assisted with programs to improve the management of the soils and land
        cover to reduce soil erosion.

1.4.2 For WISMP 1 at least 1.3 million poor farm families, especially share-croppers, as
well as possibly 1 million daily laborers were likely to benefit directly from the more reliable
irrigation service and increased income, and indirectly from improved access to agricultural
information and extension services, and new business opportunities. For NTB-WRMP the
beneficiaries were estimated at around 200,000 households.

1.5     Original Components

1.5.1   The WISMP1 project has the following three components:

Component A. Basin Water Resources Management (Base Cost – US$56.7M)

A1. Sector Governance and Basin Planning (Base cost – US$14.1M): to assist in
establishing and/or strengthening of the following institutions: (a) National Water Council
(NWC) and its precursor the Coordination Team (of Ministers) for Water Resources
Management, with their Secretariats; (b) National Steering Committee for Water Resources
(NSCWR) plus Secretariat; (c) Provincial Water Resources Council (PWRC) plus Secretariat,
in 12 provinces; (d) Basin Water Resources Committees (BWRC) in project river basins; and
(e) Dam Safety Commission (DSC) and Dam Safety Unit. In addition, Provincial Planning
Units were to be established as well as the Central Basin Planning Unit.




                                               4
A2. Management Capacity of Basin Agencies (Base Cost - US$10.4 M):                  to establish
and/or strengthen the River Basin Management Units (Balai PSDA), under provincial budget
and Basin Corporations (PJTs), including all studies, training and technical assistance.
A3. Fiscal and Cost Recovery Policy (Base Cost - US$2.00 M): to establish and/or
strengthen the fiscal position and cost recovery of water management in river basins through
funding to the Balai PSDA, PJT (Basin Corporations), provincial and kabupaten Bapedaldas
(Environmental Management Offices) and provincial Dinas PUP, contingent upon the Annual
Work Plan/Program (AWP) review.

A4. Basin Management and River Infrastructure Improvement (Base Cost - US$28.7
M): including: (a) support for operation and monitoring; (b) river infrastructure maintenance
(RIM) - operationalization of asset management and routine maintenance; (c) prioritized
urgent repairs of key river and flood control infrastructure; and (d) establishment of a
National Water Quality Monitoring Network.

A5. National Capacity Building Network (Base Cost - US$1.6 M): To develop a
sustainable human resources (HR) capacity building process for water resources and irrigation
management, it was necessary to reorient higher education programs towards multi-
disciplinary and integrated approaches.

Component B. Participatory Irrigation Management (Base Cost - US43.0 M)

B1. Water User Associations Capacity Building (Base Cost - US$8.3 M): to establish and
operationalize: (a) Kabupaten Irrigation Commissions (Komisi Irigasi), with Kabupaten
Dinas, WUAFs (GP3A) and other stakeholders and gender sensitive; and (b) scheme-level or
apex WUAFs (IP3A), and individual WUAs, with voluntary active women‟s participation
(GP3A,IP3A2) in all schemes.

B2. Irrigation Department Capacity Building (Base Cost - US$5.1 M) at Kabupaten level
since the role of Kabupaten Dinas PUP would orient more to facilitation and be reorganized
so technical staff, extension workers (KF'L) and Community Organizers would work with
WUAFs to provide technical/management guidance for O&M and construction, including:

B3. Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement (Base Cost - US$26.8 M) funded Kabupaten
and provinces that adopted the institutional model of the irrigation reform PKPI. Once the
Kabupaten Irrigation Improvement Facility (KIIF) had been established WUAF could also be
funded.

B4. Irrigated Agriculture Improvement Program (IAIP) (Base Cost - US$2.7 M) aimed
to: (a) strengthen farmer organizations‟ (WUAFs) technical, organizational, and managerial
capacity to formulate demands and to interact efficiently and with bargaining power with
service providers (research, extension, agricultural inputs, processing, credit, etc.); and (b)
make service providers (public and private) more responsive (demand driven), farmer
oriented and accountable.

Component C. Project Management (Base Cost US$8.1M)

This Component would support the National Project Management Unit and the National
Project Implementation Units, as well as the Provincial and Kabupaten Project Management

and Project Implementation Units. The following were the main Technical Assistance
packages to support Project Management: (a) Financial Management Service (FMS); (b)
Impact Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (IMEU); and (c) Preparation of WISMP 2.

1.5.2 The NTB-WRMP intentionally had an identical project structure, components and
sub-components. More specifically it has three components: (a) Basin Water Resources
Management (Euro 5.17 million); (b) Strengthening Participatory Irrigation Management
(Euro 4.60 million) and (c) Project Management and Technical Assistance (Euro 0.93
million). Despite this overall similarity, there was a significant difference in the proportion of
costs of the various expenditure categories between the two projects. For NTB-WRMP the
Services category (TA, Training, Studies and M&E) amounted to 56% of total costs and
Works to 36% compared with 46% and 37%3 respectively for WISMP.

1.6        Revised Components

1.6.1 There was no significant modification of the components in the program project,
except that under WISMP1 the activities related to dam safety management and some
activities related to water environment management were taken out. This is because: (a) the
dam safety management related activities were taken up by a parallel Dam Operational
Improvement and Safety Project financed by the Bank; and (b) the Ministry of Environment
had already got its own similar program funded by the Government.

1.7        Other Significant Changes

1.7.1 Changes in design. Some aspects of the Program changed after WISMP 1 was
approved in 2003 prior to the issue of UU 7/2004, such as the re-arrangement of irrigation
system and basin water resources management authority and mandates. These adjustments
mainly affected the irrigation component and were accommodated in the restated DCA and
approved by management:
               Transfer of irrigation management authority to the WUAFs was replaced by
       participatory irrigation management (PIM) as public irrigation asset ownership and
       control was vested in the State. PIM Principles were agreed upon and confirmed in
       the restated DCA;
               Cost recovery through service fees by government agencies was precluded
       through the Law on Water Resources and the regulations on public administration. As
       a consequence, alternative mechanisms were developed through (i) enhanced
       contributions from water users by sharing management tasks and responsibilities and
       (ii) enhanced government budget allocations. Another consequence was that the
       support for corporatization of basin agencies that recover costs from irrigation water
       users could not be materialized.

1.7.2 Changes in regulations. The issuance of revised government and ministerial
regulations necessitated a further adjustment at the Mid-Term Review (MTR) through a DCA
Amendment. This involved some changes in the key indicators.

1.7.3      Changes in financing mechanism of GoI contribution. The co-financing method for
           the GoI contribution was changed into parallel financing for participating provinces
           and kabupaten to harmonize central and local government project budgeting
           processes. Under the initial co-financing arrangement both central government
           budget (APBN) and local government funds (APBD) were applied together which




3
    Including all River Infrastructure Maintenance (RIM) expenditures.

                                                    6
        caused administrative difficulties during implementation. Parallel financing separated
        the central and local budget processes. After the change, disbursement increased
        significantly. The change was approved by the management and incorporated in the
        DCA amendment of 2009.

1.7.4 Changes in implementation arrangements. Following the issue of Government
Regulation 38/2007, the responsibility for guidance to WUAF was changed from MoPW to
MoA. This had only budgeting consequences as MoA was already fully engaged in the
implementation process. This minor change was approved by management through the
supervision aide memoire.

1.7.5 Changes in scope and scale. The scope of activities remained the provincial and
district water resources and irrigation agencies and their river basins and irrigation systems.
National basins and systems were excluded from the project after the new water resources law
UU 7/2004 because of the lack of downstream regulations on management arrangements for
national basins. The geographic scope of activities increased during the implementation of the
program and was approved by management through the supervision aide memoires:
      The number of provinces included increased by 2 to 14 with the inclusion of Aceh
         and the splitting of South Sulawesi into South and West Sulawesi;
      For the Basin Water Resources Management component, the initial number of 42
         basins grew to 54 basins due to re-delineation of the river basin boundaries in 2006;
      For PIM the number of participating districts (kabupaten) grew from 70 initially to
         ultimately 99 due to splitting of 6 participating districts and the introduction of 23
         new districts in 2009 for initial introduction of the reform only.

1.7.6 The above changes also affected NTB-WRMP. In addition, during implementation
increased attention was given to watershed conservation, which was an issue of particular
relevance to NTB, but of less crucial interest to most of the 12 provinces covered by WISMP.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1     Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

2.1.1 Soundness of Background Analysis: WISMP was an extension and consolidation of
the broad and coherent support the Bank provided from 1997 onwards. This support
emphasized institutional development. It took both the form of gradual introduction of new
administrative and regulatory mechanisms at local and national government levels, and the
extensive piloting thereof in the field. Even after the issuance of proper “facilitating?
national-government regulations, few local governments were able to act upon them. Water
users, and especially farmer irrigators, were ill prepared to assume their new responsibilities.
Progress was slow since the local governments, newly empowered by the 1999 Regional
Autonomy Laws, and civil society-based organizations had to adjust and develop the requisite
local consensus and absorb the new opportunities.

2.1.2. JIWMP first introduced and piloted novel irrigation management arrangements on
Java and notably set up, and “coached? a large number of autonomous, self-governing
Federations of Water User Associations (WUAFs) of irrigators. JIWMP also introduced and
supported River Basin Management Units under provincial governments (Balai PSDA) and
Water Resources Management Committees to foster integrated resource management and
enhance accountability. In parallel, WATSAL built on this new body of field experience, and
supported the development of a broad-based framework of policy, legal, regulatory and
administrative reforms at national and local levels. Thereafter, IWIRIP replicated these
reforms in seven provinces outside Java, whilst continuing support in the Java provinces. The
pilot reforms under JIWMP and IWIRIP had been successful as demonstrated in a


                                               7
representative household survey completed in April 2003. They appeared robust after four
solid years of field implementation, and the gradual consolidation of the new legal and
regulatory frameworks at the national level. These pilot areas covered approximately 235,000
ha in 63 kabupatens in 12 provinces.

2.1.3. WISMP Phase I was the response to the challenges of the reform implementation and
a consistent and systematic extension of this prior support, whilst offering the opportunity to
further improve and adapt the institutional designs to Indonesia‟s diversity. Project
preparation and design was therefore firmly grounded in a wealth and depth of prior
experience and piloting. The whole WISMP program was sensibly structured as a three-
tranche, 12-year APL, which ensured the longer period of continued financing required with
benefits not only in continuity but also greater flexibility.

2.1.4 Assessment of Project Design. The project development objectives (PDO) were well
chosen and appropriate, stressing better water allocation and water conservation, better sector
governance, and increased agricultural productivity and improved irrigation performance. The
division of the project into two main components, one mainly supporting change in overall
management and planning institutions and the other looking at participative irrigation
management and strengthening of Water User Associations and Federations (WUAs/WUAFs)
struck a good and sensible balance. However, project design was too complex and ambitious
in a number of respects, although such design may well be justified for an institutional reform
oriented operation of this nature: (a) the project‟s geographic coverage extended to 12
provinces and included 70 kabupatens4; (b) the project supported a wide range of reforms and
initiatives through some 9 sub-components; (c) project organization was also complex,
involving four ministries, namely the Ministry of Public Works, formerly the Ministry of
Settlement and Regional Infrastructure (Kimprawil), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA),
the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) and the Ministry of Environment (KLH). Implementation
arrangements involved setting up Project Management Units (PMU) and Project
Implementation Units (PIU) for each of the participating Ministries at each of the three levels
– national, provincial and kabupaten; (d) the project was co-financed by the Government of
Netherlands and the associated NTB-WRMP project parallel financed by the European
Union.

2.1.5 The project scope, both geographically and in the range of activities, supported
imposed a heavy burden on both project management and Bank supervision. Setting up the
many PMUs and PIUs required significant new recruitment and created difficulties in getting
staff of adequate qualification and experience. Overall guidance was provided by a National
Steering Committee (on Water Resources) chaired by the National Development Planning
Agency (Bappenas) with the main responsibility for implementation resting with the
Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) of Kimprawil and the participating
provincial and kabupaten governments. The decentralized approach adopted by the project
and Government‟s fiscal decentralization helped implementation. Adequate regard was paid
to Bank safeguard policies for environmental and social concerns.

2.1.6 Government commitment: The overall WISMP program and the WISMP Phase I
project constituted a major plank in the Government (GoI) policy of decentralization. GoI had
issued the new decentralization legislation covering administrative regional autonomy (Law
22) and fiscal balance (Law 25) in 1999. These major sector reforms were to be implemented
through the Five-Year Development Strategy (Propenas) which became law in 2000. At
project appraisal, GoI had completed the most significant parts of the Water Resources
Reform Program on which WISMP was based. All the 12 provinces and their constituent



4
    From 2009 onwards, 14 provinces and 99 kabupaten

                                                       8
kabupaten had 2 to 4 years of piloting river basin management and participatory irrigation
management, and had started reforms at the local government level. 63 out of the 70
kabupatens had already adopted the irrigation reform principles and were participating in the
JIWMP and IWIRIP programs. In terms of river basin management, some 23 River Basin
Management Units (Balai PSDA) had been established in all the river basin territories (SWS)
of Java and a further 10 had been formed in the Outer Islands. The WISMP program and the
Phase I project were therefore at the heart of a major GoI policy initiative. Weak aspects of
government commitment were the more than two years delay in WISMP loan effectiveness,
the inability to introduce legislation to enable cost recovery and frequent late budget releases.
The two-year delay in loan effectiveness was due to the government‟s decision to await the
issuance of the new water law in 2004, which led to no disbursement before 2006.

2.1.7 Stakeholder commitment: Interest in improving irrigation system infrastructure and
management grew with the advances made by earlier projects. Local government, civil
society, farmer groups including WUAs and farm families were all enthusiastic about the
project. However, the speed with which this underlying commitment could be put into
practice depended on the time taken for issuing of the necessary laws and regulations at
national, provincial and district (kabupaten) levels.

2.1.8 Risks: The PAD identified a large number of risks. These included (a) the possibility
that the sector agencies would dominate the public consultation process; (b) that inadequate
priority and resources would be given to collect information for management information
system (MIS) establishment and M&E activities; and (c) that insufficient priority and support
would be given to the fiscal sustainability and cost recovery aspects.

2.1.9 The first of these risks has been successfully mitigated during project implementation
by encouraging the participation of water users and civil society. The other risks duly became
apparent during implementation. With such a large, complex and innovative project coming at
a time when political changes and strategy still remained to be consolidated there were clearly
many uncertainties and numerous risks to be faced. Three important risks were not listed: (a)
risk of implementation delays due to lack of the necessary laws, decrees or other legal
instruments to allow implementation to proceed systematically, particularly since in most
cases enabling legislation was required at the highest level in order to get – “by cascade? - the
necessary instruments at Ministerial, Provincial and Local Government levels; (b) delays in
release of government annual budget at the central and local levels, which has been a chronic
problem for many years; and (c) the over-frequent transfer of staff, which is also a
longstanding problem and one which has a very negative impact on building institutional
capacity, dissipates training impact and slows implementation. Considering the number of
uncertainties and challenges the project faced in implementation, a substantial overall risk
rating would have been more appropriate.

2.1.10 QAG “Quality at Entry?. The project was reviewed by the QAG and received an
overall rating of satisfactory.

2.1.11 NTB-WRMP did not share the experience of long involvement in water resources and
Bank projects and the same depth of background analysis. The fact that the province had
missed out on earlier assistance was one of the reasons for EU interest in funding. To enable
the project to run concurrently with WISMP it had to be prepared quickly and with a more or
less identical design as WISMP. There do not appear to have been very substantial inputs of
government officers in project identification and appraisal. The project assessment was
carried out on the basis of a consultant assessment report, and there was not a formal appraisal
mission nor a project appraisal document. As a result, the design in terms of activities to be
undertaken was identical to those included in WISMP and were not tailored to the particular
needs of NTB, especially in regard to the need for catchment rehabilitation and management.
Also some aspects of the design were inadequate, most noticeably in relation to M&E. There

                                               9
was a serious lack of definition of appropriate key performance indicators, and there was no
baseline survey. Consequently whatever M&E data was eventually collected provided little
help to project management since the results could not be interpreted5.

2.1.12 The project design was almost identical for WISMP 1 and NTB-WRMP. Under the
WISMP Program, the first phase project focused largely on institutional change and capacity
building. In contrast, NTB-WRMP‟s targeting of agricultural productivity and income
improvement, although not officially part of the project objectives, appears overly optimistic.
The degree of commitment of both the provincial and local governments and other
stakeholders on the other hand appears to have been equal to or greater than that for WISMP,
perhaps as a result of the grant financing.

2.1.13 Recognizing the relative lack of experience in project implementation, the NTB-
WRMP had significantly heavier technical assistance (TA) and training inputs than WISMP.
This emphasis in support for institutional change and capacity building was a strong feature
of the project design.

2.2      Implementation

2.2.1 During WISMP I and NTB-WRMP implementation there were a number of factors
which affected the projects. These include:

         (a) The issuance of Law 7/2004 meant that the strategy of handing over irrigation
         authority to the WUAFs had to be modified to that of participatory irrigation
         management (PIM). It also meant that water users could only share in operating costs
         by taking up specified tasks and responsibilities and providing their labor. Cost
         recovery through service fees was precluded.

         (b) Initially, WISMP1 included 12 provinces and 70 kabupatens6, of which 63 had
         participated in the precursor JIWMP and IWIRIP programs. As implementation
         progressed, the project scope expanded to include 99 kabupatens and 54 river basins.

         (c) Problems in timely release of budget were partially solved at MTR by modifying
         financing arrangements from joint to parallel financing for both central government
         funds (APBN) and local government funds (APBD). Nevertheless, the problem of
         late release of APBN continued to affect the pace of implementation.

         (d) Staff continuity and capability, particularly at the kabupaten and field levels often
         proved difficult. Although the project had a large training program, the rapid transfer
         of staff meant that the staff training benefits were often either very much diluted or
         lost entirely.

         (e) Recruitment and fielding of TA teams was delayed until late 2007. Some TA
         support during the initial period was provided by bridging TA from IWIRIP and later

additional provinces and kabupaten joined the project: Aceh Province (2) in 2006, West Sulawesi after the split
from South Sulawesi in 2007, a number of new kabupatens (17) were added (also due split) so that total numbers
in the project at the end of implementation is 14 provinces and 99 kabupatens.


                                                      10
        through individual consultants. The support provided by local consultants was
        variable in its impact. Much of the consultancy input for MPW was delivered at the
        central or provincial headquarters level with little support provided at the kabupaten
        or field level, where it was most required. In contrast, most of the TA for MOHA was
        delivered at the kabupaten level.

2.2.2 The new Water Law also had a major impact on the Basin Management Component
in that it led to reorganization of river basins (SWS), shifting most of the important basins to
central management and thus excluding them from the WISMP program in line with the
project design. Much of the staff from the provincial agencies that were involved in basin
management functions were moved to the central agencies for managing the central basins.
This also disrupted the flow of funds to the provincial basins.

2.2.3 NTB-WRMP initially got off to a slow start due to the changing political situation,
elections and delays in processing and approving provincial legislation required the
establishment of the Provincial Water Council (Dewan SDA) and Basin Water Councils
(TKPSDA). Originally it was expected that these would be established by the end of
December 2006. However, the final version of the Governor‟s Decree establishing the Dewan
SDA and specifying its membership was issued only in July 2009, followed by a decree from
Dinas PU to establish the council‟s secretariat in August 2009. Establishment of three
TKPSDAs, respectively in Lombok, Sumbawa and Bima Dompu was similarly delayed. The
decree to establish the Lombok TKPSDA (Lombok being a national basin) was issued in
February 2009, the one for Bima Dompu was established in 2010 and that for Sumbawa was
on-going at the time of the ICR.

2.2.4 Similarly, establishment of the three River Basin Management Units (Balai PSDA)
and the Water Resources Information Unit were delayed by the changes in the national legal
setting and the need to develop and approve local regulations. The required Governor‟s
Decree was issued in August 2008. However, due to budget and staff shortages the Balai only
became functional in April 2009.

2.2.5 In a manner analogous to delay in release of the Bank loan proceeds for WISMP, a
major cause of slow implementation of NTB-WRMP was the frequent delay in release of the
EU grant through the central government budget (DIPA), either due to delays in DIPA per se;
or as a result of late release of provincial counterpart funds (APBD) – which are expected to
be made available before DIPA can be released; or as a result of blocking of the DIPA due to
submission of unacceptable budget requests or submission of modifications to budget
requests. Both of these latter problems reflected a generic and pervasive lack of planning. The
problem of late release was also further aggravated by the accepted convention that for each
item of expenditure, funding had to be provided 80% from the EU grant (through DIPA) and
20% through the APBD counterpart budget. Following the MTR, the project and grant
agreements were modified to allow a more flexible approach while maintaining the overall
principle of the 80:20 share in funding. As a result of these difficulties expenditure on
Component A at end 2007 was less than 8% of total allocations.

2.2.6    As a result of tendering delays, the TA Team was mobilized only in January 2008.
Subsequently, activities lagged because the consulting firm was unable to mobilize an
adequate number of specialists. Of the six specialists who were to support specific activities
in Part A only the Hydrology Specialist was fielded in April 2008 and the MIS/Database and
Water Allocation Specialist in April 2009. Difficulty in maintaining a fully staffed TA Team
continued during the remainder of implementation.




                                              11
2.2.7 Adequacy of staff, in numbers, qualification and continuity also proved a major
difficulty, as was the case in WISMP. Excessive staff relocation negatively impacted on the
whole project, in particular reducing the beneficial impact of training and capacity building7.

2.2.8 The MTR of WISMP and NTB-WRMP in February/March 2008 had a positive
impact on project performance. Although there were no significant changes in project design
or restructuring, a number of changes were made regarding procurement and funding
arrangements. Most importantly these allowed a change from joint to parallel financing and
greater flexibility in the procurement arrangements and increasing financing limits, including
amendments to the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) and the Grant Agreement (GA).

2.3      Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1. WISMP M&E design: The PAD (Annex 1) listed a large number of key performance
indicators. There were 14 End-of-Program Indicators, which were also in the nature of
outcome indicators, relating to the WISMP program. These were followed by 18 outcome
indicators (10 for the Component A and 8 for the Component B) and 39 output indicators.
However, only 10 outcome indicators were included in the DCA (7 for Component A and 3
for Component B). In hindsight the number of indicators was clearly too large and not all
indicators were readily measurable.

2.3.2. At the design stage, an Impact Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (IMEU) was engaged
to ensure that WISMP would have an effective and adaptive learning process. IMEU had
responsibility for monitoring and evaluating key outcomes and impacts of the water and
irrigation sector reforms and documenting perceptions and recommendations of stakeholders
about WISMP activities. As an independent M&E body, IMEU monitored WISMP outputs
and evaluated its outcomes and impacts, at the national, provincial, kabupaten, river basin and
irrigation system levels, and reported directly to the National Steering Committee For Water
Resources (NSCWR). However, IMEU only issued its first report in April 2009, barely 20
months before implementation completion. Technical support on M&E was provided
nationally to four NPIUs, and provincially to four PPIUs to monitor the output level
indicators of Dinas PSDA/Pengairan, Bappeda, and Dinas Pertanian. The NPMU took charge
of consolidating all the information from the NPIUs and PPIUs.

2.3.3. M&E implementation: In order to enhance the project monitoring and supervision
process, during the MTR, the Bank teams suggested revising the original set of indicators to
accommodate the changes in legal and institutional settings and sector environment. Some of
the changes were triggered by the new laws and regulations, in particular Water Law 2004
and Ministerial Decrees 11a, 12 and 138. Subsequently, three outcome indicators (for
Component A) and the target dates for all ten indicators (in the 2005 DCA) were revised
through the 2009 DCA amendment. Despite the wide range of indicators listed in the PAD,
there was no systematic tracking of the indicators to demonstrate the achievement until the
time of the Mid-Term Review (MTR), following which a revision of the key indicators took
place through a DCA amendment in 2009. Moreover, only four PDO level outcome indicators

  The February/March Supervision Mission Aide Memoire cites that the staff of the Sumbawa Barat
KPIU had been replaced three times in the previous year.
8
  Decree 11, 12 and 13 created the concept of geographical boundaries between national and provincial
river basins. The national river basin authority replaced and made obsolete some of the provincial
River-basin authorities. The objective of the project is to strengthen the local institutions; therefore, the
project has limited the scope of work at only the provincial level river-basin. The indicators have been
modified accordingly.

                                                     12
and one intermediate outcome indicator were used to report the findings and outcomes of
supervision missions in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs).

2.3.4 M&E utilization: After the MTR, rigorous efforts were made to keep better track of
project achievement by introducing a list of measurable output indicators which were
included in each mission aide memoire besides the above mentioned key performance
indicators used in the ISRs. In parallel, the Borrower, through the technical assistance
provided under Component C involving both IMEU and PMU/PIUs, produced consolidated
evaluation reports with appropriate data for the final assessment of the project as detailed in
the Borrower‟s ICR. While all the output and outcome indicators in Annex 14 of the PAD are
included in the IMEU‟s final report, it is difficult to extract the overall assessment of the
sector wide achievement. Because of the delay in start-up of M&E and limited information
produced, the output was not used to inform decision making and resource allocation in
WISMP Phase I. The lessons learned from implementation of M&E under the WISMP Phase
I have been incorporated into the M&E design of the Phase II project.

2.3.5 Methodological “soundness?, data quality, and M&E sustainability. M&E was
handicapped by the large number of indicators that were expected to be monitored and the
system does not appear to have proved a worthwhile tool to project management in
implementation. The likelihood of insufficient priority and resources being given to collection
of MIS data had been correctly identified as a risk at appraisal, based on experience with
other projects in Indonesia and in the region. Even the provision of technical assistance
proved inadequate. Like other institutional strengthening projects much of the investment
under WISMP was in “soft? items such as training and TA. For these aspects M&E was
unable to measure the quality of such investments nor the benefits accruing from them. Future
sustainability of M&E will be ensured by the Phase II project.

2.3.6 NTB-WRMP M&E design was inadequate, as mentioned in paragraph 2.1.11. The
design assigned no clear responsibilities for M&E, nor suggested any M&E plan. Key
performance indicators were not well defined and there was no baseline survey, nor did the
design include any M&E inputs by the TA Team. As a result, M&E undertaken was confined
to monitoring of the project‟s financial and physical progress. Repeated requests by
supervision missions for more quantitative information on the project‟s progress remained
unsatisfied. Therefore, the information collected was of little use to project management in
informing decisions and learning lessons from the implementation experience.

2.3.7 The EU fielded M&E missions during the project period, including a mid-term
review mission and a completion evaluation mission. The findings and recommendations of
the EU missions on inadequate high-level guidance on the sector reform process, rigidity of
the financing/budget system and inactivity of some water resource councils and irrigation
commissions, as well as recommendations for improving project management were largely
incorporated in the remaining project implementation period. Recommendations such as the
need for strengthening the M&E system and more attention to the sustainability of new
participatory management institutions have also been considered in the design for the follow-
up program, the second phase of the Water Resources and Irrigation Sector Management
Program (WISMP2) under which NTB province and all districts have been included.`

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Generally speaking, project implementation in both WISMP and NTB-WRMP was in
compliance with the applicable Bank and government policies and requirements. The detailed
assessment is as follows:

2.4.2 Environmental and Social Safeguards: The Bank policy on environmental assessment
was triggered for this project. Environmental guidelines were developed as part of the Project

                                              13
Management Manual to guide project staff on environmental safeguards management during
implementation. No significant environmental impacts were observed during site visits and
interactions with PIUs and local communities. However, the monitoring and reporting of the
process and results of environmental screening and management under the project leave much
room for improvement. The Bank‟s policy on Involuntary Resettlement was also triggered,
given that the physical works were minor and limited to the rehabilitation of the existing
system, simple frameworks for land acquisition and resettlement were prepared for the project.
No land acquisition with compensation was reported during project implementation. Very
limited land acquisition took place for the community-based irrigation canal rehabilitation. The
land was voluntarily donated by the land (paddy field) owners, which is a very common
practice for interventions aiming at improved irrigation water supply and drainage.
Furthermore, the Bank policy on Indigenous Peoples was triggered. Considering that the
project covers a number of provinces having indigenous groups, and the exact project sites
could not be identified during the project preparation stage, a simple indigenous peoples
framework was developed to guide the project implementation units in dealing with indigenous
groups if present in subproject areas. During project implementation, no issues on indigenous
peoples were reported partly because the program was implemented in a highly participatory
way.

2.4.3 Financial Management: Some financial management (FM) weaknesses affected project
implementation, including frequent delay in issuance or required revision of budget documents
(DIPA and DPA), and lack of random verification of 3rd party invoices at the PMU level.
Delay in the budget document (DIPA) release proved to be a chronic problem during project
implementation mainly because different sources of funds have separate mechanisms and
process timing. IFR submission was delayed often because of the many layers of reporting and
data consolidation, and lack of effective information management system. The internal control
system appears to have worked adequately during project implementation, except in one
particular case which called for more careful verification and confirmation of third party
invoices in future.

2.4.4 Implementation of Anti Corruption Action Plan (ACAP): In general, the ACAP was
implemented diligently during the project period as illustrated by the following: (i) Information
disclosure: at the central level, information was displayed through the Ministry of Public
Works‟ website, and the website was complemented with the website of the Impact Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit (IMEU), which published reports and activities online. Participating local
governments with their own websites also featured activities and sub-projects funded by
WISMP; (ii) Participation: farmer groups, associations, and other groups such as academia
participate in the project in various forms. In some kabupatens, however, more support to
farmers groups in capacity building and improving collective decision making would have
been desirable; and (iii) Complaints Handling: various channels were available, at least at the
central level. The low level of complaints indicates that the channels may not have been widely
communicated. An INT case related to one of the TA consultancy contract under Component 1
of WISMP1 affected the full completion of some activities of basin water resources
management. The resolution of this case led to strengthened financial control through invoice
and payment verifications.

2.4.5 Procurement:       Overall procurement implementation was in compliance with Bank
procurement policies and agreed procedures. The main issues related to procurement involved
generally inadequate procurement capacity at different government levels which were
enhanced largely by procurement specialists from the TA consultants. Delays in tendering,
particularly the key implementation support TAs substantially affected project progress in the
initial years. Some recurring weaknesses in procurement both at the central and regional
levels, notably in contract management, use of shopping method by the district implementing
units, were addressed through hands-on training.

2.5     Post-completion Operation and Next Phase

2.5.1 As set out in Section 2, the WISMP Phase I project was part of the larger WISMP
program, financed by an Adaptable Program loan (APL). As such the longer-term program
objectives of increased production and improved incomes and living standards will only be
achieved if the progress made under the first phase project is supported by continued
financing under subsequent phases. Four triggers were identified at appraisal for initiating
WISMP Phase II. These were. (a) four fully functional provincial river basin management
units (Balai PSDA); (b) fifty WUAFs legally established and functional with respect to
governance, maintenance and rehabilitation of schemes, financial sustainability, and using
extension services and credit; (c) operational guidelines agreed on river basin management
including environmental and social safeguards; and (d) fifty per cent of external funding
disbursed. All four triggers have been met or exceeded, confirming that the WISMP APL
program is ready for the next phase, which would include NTB.

2.5.2 Investments made and initiatives taken under the WISMP Phase I and the NTB-
WRMP projects will be further supported and maintained under the succeeding Phase II
project that was approved in March 2011. A major objective of the whole program is
participative irrigation management and an increased role of WUAs/WUAFs in operation and
maintenance of irrigation systems. This change will increase the overall sustainability of the
whole irrigation sector by reducing the burden on Government and allowing the sector
agencies to focus more closely on O&M of those major works that are beyond the O&M
abilities of WUAs and WUAFs.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1     Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

3.1.1 WISMP Relevance of Objectives: The project development objectives (PDOs)
(paragraph1.2.2) are as relevant at loan closing as they were at appraisal. Population growth,
urbanization, economic development and the impacts of climate change place increasingly
high pressure on land and water resources and increase the vulnerability of the nation to water
related risks such as floods. Under such circumstances, improved water allocation and
management, better sector governance and sector fiscal sustainability are critically important
for Indonesia. Greater involvement of stakeholders and the private sector , better coordination
of government agencies, rehabilitation of schemes where required with sustainable O&M
arrangements, leading to better services and increased water productivity and higher farm
income remain central to Government policies.

3.1.2 Relevance of Design and Implementation: The WISMP Program remains fully in line
with the national decentralization and democratization policies. The key elements of
interventions for improving planning and management capacity, governance and fiscal
sustainability and an integrated and participatory management approach at the river basin and
system levels remain highly relevant. A vital feature of the design was to make the program
an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) which provided the necessary time, flexibility and
security of financing essential for significant restructuring of a major government institution,
or group of sector institutions. The ability to spread the institutional changes over the duration
of the whole program has undoubtedly given a degree of flexibility that has had a strongly
positive effect on implementation, particularly in helping to address such long-standing,
delicate issues as division of responsibilities and collaboration between central, provincial and
district governments. Change in long established government institutions often tends to be a
long and slow process. What happens during implementation is therefore arguably more
important than the plans laid out in the project design.



                                               15
3.1.3 NTB-WRMP Relevance in Objectives, Design and Implementation reflects the
project‟s close relationship with WISMP. As such, most of the assessments mentioned above
also apply to NTB-WRMP. The only significant point of difference is in the project‟s poverty
alleviation objective. No claim for immediate poverty alleviation benefits was included in the
development objective of WISMP. The fact that such benefits were claimed for NTB implied
that the province – one of the poorest in Indonesia and without the advantage of involvement
in earlier Bank projects – was capable of achieving in five years what for WISMP could only
be achieved in the second phase. The objective of poverty alleviation was therefore overly
ambitious and not strictly relevant to project implementation as a one province expansion of
the WISMP program.

3.2       Achievement of PDO

WISMP 1

3.2.1 PDO (a). Water allocation, water quality and water conservation improved in Project
basins, and river infrastructure better maintained, through strengthened capacity for planning
and management and investments. This PDO is considered partially achieved although the
M&E system wasn't really able to well capture progress towards achievement of the PDO.
Water allocation plans were prepared for 9 basins through a participatory approach to enable
more equitable allocation and reduce water use conflicts. Progress was slower than expected
in developing a Water Use Rights Framework. The upcoming Government Regulation on
Water Use Rights will be piloted in two basins under WISMP 2. Similarly, developing a
strategic framework for environmentally sustainable river basin planning has also moved
slowly. Training was undertaken for 53 Balai PSDA and 11 Balai (B)WS. Although some
progress has been made in water quality classification, the assessment of the more profound
impact on the aquatic environment could not be undertaken in the absence of MoEnv
regulations and their participation, and it is not very clear how effective the water pollution
control is for lack of related data. Much of the activity in water quality pertained to setting up
ambient water quality network stations on selected rivers, collecting and analyzing data and
publishing in-stream water quality. In each of the 14 Dinas PUP, Surat Keputusan 9 has been
issued for role sharing in hydrometeorology between the relevant Dinas PUP and UPTD or
Balai PSDA in each participating province. The hydrometeorology asset management
function was fully transferred from the Dinas PUP to their Balai PSDA. Hydrometeorology
network rationalization has been completed in 48 Balai PSDA, and implemented and fully
operational with adequate operational budget in 24 Balai PSDA. Four Balais PSDA have been
improved in terms of hydrological information and database, water quality monitoring and
pilot water allocation & management, as a result of on-the-job training, improvement of
facilities and other capacity-building activities. MoPW has staffed and funded a national basin
planning unit. Two provinces have established Basin Planning Units (BPUs), one of which
has prepared basin strategic and master plans. Planning units have been established in most of
the Dinas PUP, but lack adequate staff and are therefore at present non-functional. Only some
Basin Water Resources Committees (BWRCs) (mainly in Java) have reviewed basin strategic
and master plans (including investment prioritization and review) and 13 PWRCs have
prepared a draft provincial policy on water resources. With the establishment of the necessary
legal and administrative decrees in all project provinces completed in 2010/2011, PWRCs and
BWRCs are expected to become more active in decision making in water resources planning
and management related decisions and activities. The project has also seen different levels of
improvement in the management performance of provincial basin management units (Balai
PSDA).

3.2.2 Satisfactory results were achieved from the Basin River Infrastructure Maintenance and
Management (RIM) sub-component, as observed in the supervision mission and interviews
with the beneficiaries, in spite of limited investment. The small scale rehabilitation and
upgrading works for improving bulk water supply and flood risk management in some 50 Balai
PSDA, have yielded expected outcomes. Furthermore, through public consultation and
beneficiary participation not only the river infrastructure investments and O&M were better
aligned with regional priorities, but the quality and cost-effectiveness of the project works
were improved as well. River infrastructure works, especially in the Citarum basin financed
under the project, are providing intended benefits to the beneficiary communities (protecting
houses, schools and home industries from seasonal flooding, which has both an economic and
social benefit), despite the fact that they could have been more closely linked to water
resources management planning in the respective basins. The RIM program involved
rehabilitation and/or upgrading of river infrastructure. The river infrastructure is expected to be
better maintained as asset management is practiced and quality assurance practice enforced10.

3.2.3 Good progress has been made in establishing Management Information Systems
(MIS). Six provincial Dinas PUPs (and Balai PSDA) have developed MISs linked to the
respective Bappeda. The system is intended to be linked to DGWR, but this has not yet been
achieved. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) has been developed covering 13 provinces and
84 kabupaten. With TA inputs and support from Bangda, M&E performance improved, but
remains less than required, and was largely confined to monitoring of the project‟s physical
and financial progress, and project outputs.

3.2.4 In support of capacity building, 10 universities and polytechnics have set up five new
modules for integrated water resource management as well as collaboration with the Indonesia-
Netherlands knowledge sharing program for the water resources sector.

3.2.5 PDO (b). Sector governance enhanced, and sector fiscal sustainability
strengthened, nationally and in Project basins through setting up Water Resources
Councils; ensuring broad stakeholder involvement; unbundling of operational tasks;
and Private Sector Participation; and improved cost recovery. This is virtually
achieved.
Sector governance has improved at the national, provincial and provincial basin levels as a
result of the institutional changes, multi-stakeholder forum establishment and capacity-
building of management agencies supported by the project. Most importantly, the
achievements include establishment of the National Water Resources Council (NWC) in
200911 (NWC). Thirteen out of the fourteen project provinces established Provincial Water
Resources Councils (PWRCs) by 2010, of which nine are functional. PWRCs are required to
have 50% beneficiary representation including women and vulnerable groups. Nine provinces
have established a total of sixteen Basin Water Resources Committees (BWRCs) in 2009/2010
covering national and provincial river basins with balanced government - stakeholder
representation including women and vulnerable groups. Nine BWRCs have started operating
but they still need further support for their development and firm grounding in the management
and administration systems.
3.2.6 The project has successfully supported role-sharing between the central, provincial and
district water agencies. In each of the 14 participating provinces a Balai PSDA has been
established, each of which is fully funded by the provincial government budget (APBD). All

71 participating kabupatens covering an area of 1.4 million hectares provide an average of
Rp130,000 (US$14) per ha, more than double the target figure. The revised DG Water
Resources Decree now provides the basis for Provincial Balai PSDA to prepare memoranda of
understanding (MOU) with national B(B)WS, so far mainly on hydrology management,
supported by training in 10 provinces. There has been improvement and rationalization of
hydrology networks in 15 basins involving the Balai PSDA as well as Balai (B)WS. To date
some 69 MOUs have been agreed, compared to the 11 originally expected. In going forward,
the role-sharing and financing arrangements between provincial and national basin
management units must be expanded beyond hydrology and water infrastructure O&M and
into core areas of water resources management. This is also anticipated in the second phase of
WISMP, and calls for more detailed and strong backing by government regulations.

3.2.7 The idea at appraisal that part of the costs of water management by the basin agencies
could be recovered has not been realized since Balai and Dinas as part of government lack any
legal basis for levying water management fees.

3.2.8 In conformity with the new Permen PU31/2007, 13 provincial irrigation commissions
(Komisi Irrigasi) have been established and 98 irrigation commissions at the kabupaten level
since 2007/2008. Most of these commissions started operating in 2007/2008 although further
strengthening is still necessary for them to meet the requirements and implement the tasks as
per PerMen. Women are also represented in the commission, but no data is available on the
extent.

3.2.9 PDO (c). Increased agricultural productivity and improved performance of irrigation,
based on participatory irrigation management, through setting up and strengthening WUAFs;
strengthening restructured Dinas PUP of local government; financing rehabilitation and
improvement of existing irrigation schemes; and facilitating access to agricultural support
services and micro-credit. This is fully achieved. The achievement of the project objective is
assessed mostly on qualitative information due to lack of systematic M&E data. However,
irrigation performance improvement and agricultural productivity increase are quite evident
from the field visit observations during supervision missions and from a number of surveys12 .
In all, 11 provinces and 70 kabupaten have adopted the irrigation reform principles through
issuing local government regulations on participatory irrigation management.

 3.2.10 A total of 1,651 WUAFs have been established, of which 1,296 have been legalized to
undertake the lower canal (tertiary) system O&M and contribute to the management of
secondary systems. M&E surveys showed that out of 334 GP3A surveyed participation was
rated high in 74% of cases and moderate in 24%. The associated training activities includes
public awareness (208 sessions for 660 GP3A), development of socio-economic-technical and
cultural profiles or PSETK (172 sessions, 580 GP3A), organization (107 sessions, 209 GP3A),
and financial management (108 sessions, 209 GP3A).

3.2.11 A major sub-component was for the reformulation of tasks and responsibilities of the
Dinas PUP at the kabupaten level to enable implementation of its new mandates in providing
technical and financial support to WUAFs for system O&M. This has also involved a large
training and TA program covering 13 provinces and 56 kabupaten, as detailed in Annex 2.



12
   Surveys were undertaken by the NPMU and the NPIUs with the assistance of different TAs. In
addition, the Padjadjaran University made a comparative analysis based on surveys in participating
kabupatens in 2009. These data are incorporated in the various reports (including the Government
ICR). The evaluation from the Impact Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (IMEU) under Bappenas also
reported on the production and productivity changes in the project areas.


                                               18
3.2.12 Some 1,265 proposals for IMF funding by WUAFs in 64 kabupaten have been
presented to the Dinas PUP for review, of which some 470 have been endorsed to date and
included in annual work plans, compared to a target of 200.

3.2.13 In 18 kabupaten pilots were carried out to help strengthen the linkage of WUAFs to
market partners by providing special training programs on marketing, engagement with private
sector, post-harvest management, and provision of credit for investments in value adding
activities.

3.2.14 In summary, the Komir Irrigasi-WUAF-Dinas partnership structure established has
substantially improved irrigation services and management of primary and secondary canal
systems. The project has also strengthened the support of irrigation and agricultural services to
the WUAFs and participatory decision-making for irrigation management at the kabupaten
level. Consequently, System performance and sustainability have improved as evidenced by
more reliable and equal water distribution in the project schemes. Conflicts over irrigation
water use have been much reduced, for example in Central Java, as a result of the project.
Farmer user communities are now responsible for O&M of the lower canal systems and in
many cases contributing in cash or kind to main system O&M. This is in addition to a general
increase in local government budget for irrigation scheme O&M. Finally, in terms of
agricultural productivity improvement, the government‟s official statistics showed that in the
project areas the productivity rose by 15-20% on average through increasing cropping intensity
and yields, which was made possible in project areas by improved irrigation system
performance and agricultural support services. The impact observed is more profound
considering the radiation effect this project has had on government programs. Looking
forward, fully functioning of Komirs Irrigasi and WUAFs in the participating kabupaten still
requires continued support and nurturing. Further, dedicated efforts by the different levels of
governments are needed to allocate adequate O&M funding for the main systems of the
irrigation schemes under their respective jurisdictions. The experiences and lessons learned
from kabupaten schemes need to be expanded into provincial and national scheme
management with strong policy support. Finally, there is a need to continue the integration of
irrigation and agricultural development interventions within the program and between this and
other programs.

NTB-WRMP

3.2.15 PDO (a). Institutional strengthening of and performance improvement in basin water
resources management, and river infrastructure upgrading: This is largely achieved. Despite a
slow start, by the end of implementation the objective related to basin water resources
management has been largely achieved. The Provincial Water Council (Dewan SDA) and its
secretariat have been established and are functional. Two of the three River Basin Councils
(TKPSDA) were set up and the third one was being established at the end of the project. Dinas
PU has completed its institutional reform activities. Three Balai PSDA and the Balai ISDA
have been established and are functional. Initiatives have been taken through signing of MOUs
to facilitate role sharing in water resources management between national agencies and those
within the province. These MOUs enabled the Balai PSDA to be involved in management of
the national basin in Lombok and the provincial Balai to engage in management of other
assets, such as dams, which are under central government authority.

3.2.16     A Dinas PUP Surat Keputusan (Decree) has been issued for role sharing in
hydrometeorology between the relevant Dinas PUP and UPTD or Balai PSDA in the
Province, and hydromet asset management has been fully transferred from the Dinas PUP to
the relevant UPTD or Balai PSDA. Four Joint Operation Agreements between Dinas PUP and
Balai PSDA Lombok, Balai PSDA Sumbawa, Balai PSDA Bima-Dompu and Balai ISDA


                                              19
were signed in 2007. All Balai PSDA including Balai ISDA have participated in basin water
resources management activities; the project has rationalized the hydromet network and put in
place the necessary staff and training, both in the Balai PSDA and in the Balai ISDA.
However, the impact and benefits from the training and capacity building in network
management, data collection and the associated training in GIS remain unquantifiable. No
M&E system recorded the results of the training and capacity building delivered by the
project. In many cases the selection of the staff to be trained was inappropriate. The over-
frequent staff transfer meant that staff either failed to complete the courses or were transferred
to other duties soon after training. Capacity building was also undermined by budget
shortages, particularly for transport which meant that even those who had completed part of
the course were deprived of the necessary opportunities for fieldwork. As a result of the
above, the effects of such technical training are uncertain.

3.2.17 Other training and capacity building activities, such as financial management,
procurement and water allocation are reported to have been successful in improving staff
competence. Capacity building and training to improve planning capability has only made
limited progress. This included the production of strategic plans for Lombok and Bima
Dompu basins.

3.2.18 The provincial planning team in Dinas PUP has been established with appropriate
staffing and funding, supervising the outsourced planning services. Strategic plans for
Lombok and Bima Dompu basins have been completed and legalized; and a strategic plan for
Sumbawa is under preparation.

3.2.19 The Basin River Infrastructure Maintenance and Management (RIM) sub-component
and the Water Resources sub-component have both made satisfactory progress. Following a
very slow start the RIM sub-component became active, at five sites in Lombok involving
mainly flood and river bank erosion prevention through construction or repair of bank cladding
and concrete structures. In a similar way the project financed re-greening of critical areas
including establishing trial plots in Sumbawa and Lombok. These pilot or study activities are
expected to provide the basis for larger scale investments in the future.

3.2.20 PDO (b). Institutional strengthening of and performance improvement in
participatory irrigation management, and irrigation scheme rehabilitation: This is
fully achieved. The Province and all the kabupaten have issued the necessary regulations
(PerDas) and established Irrigation Commissions (Komir). They have also established 214
WUAFs, of which 184 have already signed MOUs with the Governor or the Bupati. All the
Komirs have started functioning, with established secretariats and funding from the local
budget. The Komirs meet regularly to discuss irrigation-related issues, review WUAF
proposals and endorse the kabupaten annual irrigation plan. So far the Komirs have evaluated
91 proposals for financing by IMF which have been endorsed by the Dinas PUP. Half of the
Komir members are representatives from WUAFs and other independent, non-governmental
organizations. As a result of the improved coordination and collaborations between Dinas,
Komirs, WUAFs and WUAs, there has been very significant reduction in water conflicts as
evidenced in different irrigation systems in the projt districts. The area co-managed with the
WUAFs has reached 145,000ha, more than double the target of 60,000ha, and constitutes about
half the total irrigated area of the Province. The project has partly financed the rehabilitation of
287 irrigation schemes covering 188,250ha. Parts or all of the rehabilitation work was carried
out by the WUAFs, through co-management with the Dinas. The quality of the works
completed by the WUAFs is generally superior to that by contractors. Furthermore, the
Province and most of the kabupaten have allocated the target O&M budget of Rp60,000 (US$
6.7) per ha from the APBD. WUAFs are expected to be engaged in O&M, although some has
been given to contractors, which is not the aim of the project.



                                               20
3.2.21 Agricultural development supported by the project appears to have had a significant
impact on crop production. The NTB Provincial statistics indicate a higher crop intensity with
harvest area increased by almost 10% between 2005/6/7 and 2007/8/9, while average yield of
paddy over the same period increased by over 4%. However, in the absence of any adequate
M&E system or any control group of farmers it cannot be decisively stated that all of these
increases are due to the project. Technical assistance and training have been provided for a
package including (i) System of Rice Intensification (SRI)13; (ii) integrated pest management,
(iii) agribusiness development; and (iv) adaptation to climate change. Such supports have been
very well received by farmers. Demonstration plots of SRI over a land area of 200 ha resulted
in adoption of this technology over an area of 2,000 ha by the farmers, with a yield increase of
20%-40% compared with conventional rice production systems.

3.3      Efficiency

3.3.1 Through the establishment of new democratic and participatory management
institutions, both WISMPI and NTB-WRMP have provided more reliable and efficient water
delivery to irrigated agriculture, and generated confidence among farmers/irrigators in
planning and implementing improved agricultural practices. As a result, agricultural
productivity has increased. Specifically the increase of crop production is due to: (i) enhanced
cropping intensity; (ii) crop yield increases; and (iii) changes in crop patterns shifting to
higher value produce. Also the change of the government agencies towards service
orientation and facilitation has been an important contribution. In calculating the above the
types of the project benefit from the incremental crop production, crop budgets have been
prepared for the “with project? and “without project? situations. Benefit aggregation is based
on physical achievement by year and incorporates the cropping pattern changes. Other
benefits not accounted for in the analysis include (i) cost savings from appropriate and timely
river infrastructure maintenance; (ii) cost savings relating to improved management of
flooding and mitigation of associated loss; (iii) efficiency gains from institutional
strengthening and development associated with the program; and (iv) conflict reduction
between upstream and downstream water users. The overall project ERR is for WISMP
estimated at 23%, which indicates the project is economically viable and robust.
3.3.2 Financial analysis has been conducted, using crop budgets and farm models under with
and without project situations to gauge the financial attractiveness to the farmers. The results
of the farm household income analysis show a substantial increase in farmers‟ income from
improved crop production with the implementation of the project, with the change in farm
household income increases in Java and outside Java at 32% and 27% respectively.
3.3.3 For NTB-WRMP, though no systematic and verifiable data available from M&E, it is
generally believed that the crop yield and cropping pattern increases achieved under the
project were higher than in non-Java areas under WISMPI. As such, adopting same approach
for economic analysis and using non-Java data for crop production, it was conservatively
estimated that the ERR for NTB-WRMP was at 21%.
3.3.4 In comparison with the without project situation, the fiscal impact of both projects are
largely positive as the Project introduced participatory operation and maintenance (O&M)
practices for target irrigation schemes. The funding for O&M for tertiary canal systems after
rehabilitation has been covered by the WUAs and WUAFs, while the O&M costs for the
improved secondary and main canals, which are noticeably lower after rehabilitation, are
covered by the government as per current water sector policies.

  SRI has been developed over the last 30 years and includes planting seedlings at less than 15 days
old, optimal spacing to allow weed control, careful irrigation to create aerobic conditions, and use of
compost.

3.4     Justification of the Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

3.4.1 Based on the above considerations and as also reflected in the Data Sheet and Annex
2, the overall outcomes of both WISMP 1 and NTB-WRMP projects are rated as moderately
satisfactory

3.5     Over-arching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

3.5.1 WISMP 1 did not have a specific poverty focus. However, most of the farmer
families benefitting from the project are poor. Direct beneficiaries are estimated at some 1.3
million families, or around 7.8 million people. Overall in all the provinces covered by the
project there are some 6.7 million farmer households or about 40 million people who depend
on irrigation. The data available from surveys indicates that these groups have already started
to benefit under this first phase of WISMP and these direct benefits are expected to continue
to grow under the proposed second phase.

3.5.2 NTB-WRMP had a specific poverty alleviation focus. The total population of NTB
Province at appraisal was reported to be around 4.1 million, almost 60% falling into the two
lowest economic status categories. Within the province, densely populated East Lombok was
particularly poverty affected. Because of the lack of an adequate M&E system and baseline
data it is difficult to assess the project‟s impact on production, farm incomes and poverty
alleviation. Some indications can be drawn from the provincial statistics. The official
statistics show that over the period from 2005 to 2009 the incidence of poverty declined by
3% in Lombok Timur kabupaten and 7.6% in Lombok Barat. In the two areas not covered by
the project, poverty incidence in Kota Mataram and Kota Bima increased by 5.4% and 0.3%
respectively. Absolute numbers of poverty effected persons declined by over 13% in the
seven project kabupaten and increased by 45% in Mataram and Bima. Some 200,000 farmers
(representing around one million people) in the seven kabupaten were reported to be WUA
members. It can be expected that the project‟s support to decentralization of water sector
management and greater participation by farmers and WUAFs in irrigation will have a
beneficial effect in reducing poverty in the medium and longer term.

3.5.3 The project promoted women‟s participation in project implementation as
stakeholders, decision-makers and beneficiaries. This is particularly true with the
participatory irrigation management component. Despite the lack of adequate monitoring and
gender disaggregated data, generally very positive changes in terms of increasing women‟s
participation in the project activities such as WUA/WUAF establishment and management,
irrigation and agriculture improvement activities and practical training14, were reported by
different PMUs and WUAFs through their progress reports and WUAF profiles during project
implementation. The project benefited women„s groups and women-farmers (widows,
divorcees, households in which the husband was away from home for prolonged periods
earning a salary in the non-agricultural sector) since they would have better access to water
for household use, for agricultural production and for rearing of poultry and small livestock.

3.5.4 Social development has been encouraged by the project through the establishment
and support to WUAs, WUAFs; water resources councils and irrigation commissions. All

events unless they are family members.

                                                22
these increase rural communities‟ participation in planning, construction and O&M of water
resources and irrigation infrastructure and have resulted in strengthening of civil society in the
project areas. The creation of WUAs and WUAFs has had benefits beyond purely improved
water management and irrigation. The groups have helped to develop a range of income
generating activities and have enabled linkages with the private sector, particularly in
improving farmer‟s access to market and in introducing contract farming practices.
Involvement of WUAFs in rehabilitation or improvement of works has been particularly
successful, either through joint operation with a contractor, labor contribution, or through a
service agreement where the WUAF takes the place of the contractor. Such engagements have
resulted in greater transparency, fewer opportunities for leakage of funds and better
ownership by the farmer users. The fact that all three systems provide direct benefit to the
local village economy and strengthen the relationship between the users and the service
provider is an additional bonus.

(b) Institutional Change and Strengthening

3.5.5 Sector Governance. With the establishment of National, Provincial and Basin Water
Resources Councils and the Irrigation Commissions under both projects, platforms have been
created for the stakeholders to participate in the decision making processes regarding the
management of their water resources and irrigation systems. Following activation of these
platforms, accountability and transparency in the sector have been enhanced, effectiveness
and efficiency of budget use improved in the project areas. These platforms also create better
coordination and cooperation among the government agencies in development and
implementation of their programs, priority setting and creation of synergies and mutual
program support. This is most evident in the irrigation component as the development of these
councils for river basin management is quite recent. The role of these councils and
commissions in the future is essential not only for the management of the sector itself, but
also for creating the necessary linkages with the local planning processes.

3.5.6 Service Orientation. Traditionally the government agencies were supply and project
oriented. A change towards a demand and service orientation is ongoing and is more evident
for the irrigation sector. In particular, at the kabupaten level, the water user communities and
government agencies are beginning to manage the irrigation systems in partnership using the
irrigation commission as the decision making platform. For basin water resources
management, such mechanisms still have to evolve as the stakeholder platforms are only
recently established. Moreover, the development of an effective system of accountability in
basin management requires more time as the uses and users of bulk water services are more
diverse, less aware of the water issues and historically less involved in water management
decision processes. The service orientation is least developed in the national systems as
operation and maintenance is usually delegated to provincial and district levels by the national
agencies that tend to be more project and construction oriented.

3.5.7 Capacity Building. The project made significant investments in technical and
management training and TA support for both government agency staff and for members of
WUAs and WUAFs. As a result, the professional competence of the government agencies
involved in WISMP is reported in the IMEU report to have improved, even if the impact has
been reduced by the frequent re-posting of staff. For the water users the training and TA
support have proved effective in introducing improved water management and helping
establish and operationalize the WUAs and WUAFs.

3.5.8 Cost Recovery. A fiscal policy study was completed under WISMP to recommend
policy actions to address the cost recovery issues of the sector. This included formulation of a
direct/indirect cost recovery system. At present any application of such a system is impossible
in the absence of a national policy. Law No.7/2004 excludes direct cost recovery for most
water uses including irrigation and confines direct cost recovery to abstractions for

                                               23
commercial or industrial use. The participatory management supported by the projects
involving the users/stakeholders, introduction of asset management concepts and practices
and increased financial responsibility of local governments for system rehabilitation and
O&M all serve to reduce the overall fiscal burden on the national government and improve
cost-effectiveness.

(c) Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.9 Design and implementation of the two projects has proved to be a valuable vehicle in
bringing about closer collaboration between the main donors active in the water sector.

3.6     Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 As this is a Core ICR, neither a formal beneficiary survey nor a stakeholder workshop
was organized during the ICR preparation.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

4.1      The fact that the institutional development and capacity building is a key objective of
both projects, lays a good foundation for post-completion operation of project facilities and
institutions. Another very favorable factor is that the operating/management agencies such as
Dinas, Balais PSDA and Irrigation/Agricultural Services, as well as such user community
organizations as WUAs/WUAFs, have been directly involved in project design,
implementation and on-the-job training from the start. As a result, transition from
implementation to operation becomes a straightforward process. In addition, the second phase
of WISMP APL (WISMP2), which started soon after WISMP1 and NTB-WRMP were
completed, covers virtually all participating provinces and Kabupatens including NTB. This
provides further assurance for sustaining the project interventions and results.
4.2 In terms of risks to sustaining project results and outcomes for both WISMP1 and NTB-
WSMP the following aspects deserve close attention and will need to be carefully managed in
the follow-up program (WISMP2). They are generic in character and therefore combined
below.
(a) Role sharing between national and provincial river basin management agencies. WISMP
focused on the improvement of management capacity at the national and provincial levels. In
the context of decentralization the project only involved provincial basins and agencies
because at the time of project appraisal all basin management was a provincial responsibility
(except for typical development and construction activities and 2 public basin corporations PJT
I and PJT II). Two administrative interventions have had a major impact on the provincial
Balai PSDA: (i) The introduction and delineation of national, provincial and district basins in
2006 creating lack of clarity on the role sharing of water resource management tasks between
national and provincial agencies; and (ii) the restructuring of the Provincial Dinas PUP which
includes the UPTDs/Balai PSDAs in 2007, leading to changes in their administrative structure
and range of activities. Further, the current role sharing is based on availability of annual
budget, without multi-year role sharing arrangements established by decree it would be
difficult to plan activities, develop human resources and address management issues. The new
management environment requires further clarity and agreement on role sharing and financing
which will be part of the WISMP-2 process;
(b) Role sharing and financing arrangements between national, provincial and kabupaten
irrigation management agencies. As central and provincial agencies generally lack field staff,
the Kabupaten irrigation services (Dinas PUP) are expected to provide the O&M services in
provincial and national systems which are areas outside their jurisdiction. Consequently,
Kabupatens with a large irrigation area under national or provincial responsibility are
increasingly overburdened and under-resourced. For national systems, the provinces receive

                                              24
O&M budget from the central government (through delegated task or TP15) but implementation
still relies heavily on the Kabupaten agencies. There is no TP system from provinces for
Kabupaten operational services. This has created problems in several Kabupatens as it involves
direct allocation of funds or allocation of human resources paid from Kabupaten budget for
national or provincial systems. To overcome these problems, a system of ad-hoc agreements
between the Kabupaten and Province on implementation of O&M works in provincial and
national systems is used. The budgets associated with these annual agreements do not provide
for Kabupaten service costs and overheads, and they do not provide the Kabupaten with
incentives to invest in their organization. A government or ministerial regulation is required to
guide the conclusion of multi-year agreements with financial commitments, between
Kabupaten and provincial and/or national governments, on their respective roles in
management and financing of provincial and national irrigation systems.
(c) From project to service orientation. Service oriented government agencies are essential to
achieve and sustain the development objectives. In many Kabupatens much progress has been
made in the development of management partnerships between government services and the
WUAs/WUAFs. However, in many water resources agencies, especially at provincial and
national levels, project-orientation still prevails. An important step towards service-orientation
is the definition of services and service standards (already a legal requirement) in qualitative
and quantitative terms, accompanied with measurable performance indicators and reporting
systems for accountability and transparency, including the stakeholder platforms. Service
standards combined with asset management plans provide the necessary legal basis for budget
allocation. In WISMP-2, the formulation of service standards for irrigation and water resource
management agencies, and preparation of asset management plans are expected to be standard
activities for participating Kabupatens, Provinces and Balai WS.
(d) Asset management planning for transparent multi-year financial planning. Budgets for
water resources and irrigation management agencies at kabupaten, province and national levels
are traditionally supply oriented and often based on historical allocations. The challenge is to
convince local parliaments (DPRDs) of the real needs. Kabupatens and provinces need to
move from a supply based to a need-based budgeting system which requires the development
of asset management plans that include short, medium and long term investments and O&M
financial needs. This also provides more transparency in budget allocation and use
effectiveness. This is one of the key actions for WISMP-2;
(e) Human Resource Management, Targeted Training and Staff Rotation. Many National,
Provincial and Kabupaten agencies face staff shortage as a result of a long period of no-hire
policy which only ended a few years ago. Consequently retired personnel were not replaced,
and gaps developed in staffing, knowledge and experience. A new generation of young staff
combined with the high level of staff rotation at all levels necessitates continuation of targeted
training and coaching to sustain project outcomes. However, HR management plans aiming at
knowledge development are not yet fully developed and the present knowledge management
infrastructure still requires considerable strengthening.
4.3 Based on the above considerations the overall risk to development outcome is rated
moderate.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1     Bank Performance

(a) Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

5.1.1     The WISMP Program was designed to address the critical sector issues of
governance and institutional capacity, and still remains in line with the national
decentralization policy, although some aspects of the Program have been readjusted following
the issue of Government Decree UU 7/2004 (such as rearrangement of basin water resources
management authority and mandates). The Bank‟s unique sector experience, particularly
since 1999 including Bank-financed operations such as WATSAL, had been reflected in the
project design. The key elements of an integrated and participatory management approach and
interventions for improving planning and management capacity and fiscal sustainability at the
river basin level and below, are still highly relevant and in line with the WATSAL Letter of
Sector Policy upon which WISMP is based.

5.1.2 The two substantial components (Basin Water Resources Management and
Participatory Irrigation Management) were designed to complement one another in
contributing to the achievement of the PDO. The implementation arrangement, involving
three line ministries and coordinated by the National Steering Committee (Secretariat in
Bappenas) has proven effective, and an independent monitoring and evaluation unit was
established and functioned throughout project implementation. The project design also
incorporated social and environmental factors and was fully in compliance with safeguards
policies. The assessment of risks and mitigation measures proposed at appraisal were
generally realistic and adequate although the major chronic problem of late release of
government budget was not identified as a risk. The project design was over ambitious in
geographical coverage and complexity of sub-components and activities. This presented a
heavy burden on management and supervision. As a result, achievement of objectives has
been mixed. Design of the M&E system in both projects was inadequate. In both there was
insufficient attention given to identifying suitable indicators and for the NTB-WRMP a
complete lack of any baseline survey as discussed in Section 2.3 (in particular paragraph 2.3.5
and 2.3.6).

5.1.3 The QAG panel rated the project‟s strategic relevance and approach as highly
satisfactory, environment aspects as marginally satisfactory and all other aspects and the
overall rating as satisfactory. The panel was critical regarding environmental aspects because
they were inadequately covered in the PAD, due to time constraints. The panel also criticized
the long list of conditions for loan effectiveness which had been deferred from negotiations
and Board presentation.

5.1.4 The decision to expand the project to include NTB with financing from the EU was
excellent. Generally the preparation under EU responsibility was adequate although there
were some inevitable conflicts of approach over project development objectives. Moreover
the project did not have the advantage of a wealth of previous experience, as was the case
with WISMP. Preparation and appraisal were undertaken expeditiously in order to allow
concurrent implementation with WISMP. Little attempt was made to tailor the project to the
local situation of NTB. In order to satisfy the EU‟s overall development agenda and strategy
the project development objective had to include poverty alleviation. There were also
differences in project presentation and reporting format. The Bank‟s main concern appears to
have been that the two Components A and B provided a basis for project implementation.
Inadequate attention was paid to other aspects, in particular the totally inadequate
arrangements for M&E, failure to identify appropriate key performance indicators and the

                                              26
lack of any baseline survey. These short-comings constituted significant flaws in the project
design.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.5 Bank supervision involved an integrated team of senior headquarters based and senior
country based technical staff. There were a total of some 20 supervision missions including
smaller follow-up visits over the life of the project16. Since both WISMP and NTB-WRM
were by nature a process as much as a project, supervision had a heavier than usual task in
adjusting implementation to changes in legislation, institutions and funding arrangements.
The supervision missions focused on the project development impact in addition to
monitoring the physical targets. Because there were two projects (WISMP1 and NTB-
WRMP), a single task team could draw on two sets of SPN resources which allowed the team
to supervise far more closely than would otherwise have been the case.

5.1.6 Supervision was diligent in undertaking joint supervision of WISMP and NTB-WRMP
and maintaining close contact not only with EU, but the other donor agencies involved in
water sector development, including the Asian Development Bank and bi-laterals including
the Netherlands and Japan. The supervision missions were responsive to the emerging issues
in the implementation. The WISMP Development Credit Agreement (DCA) amendments and
MTR revised the project targets, and addressed the issues in procurement and financing
arrangements. A shortage of staff in the Resident Mission Jakarta initially resulted in delays
in providing No objection letters (NOL) which slowed completion of TA contracts. Fiduciary
and Safeguard aspects were generally covered by the supervision missions and the problems
in procurement were addressed properly. The core members of the supervision missions were
maintained throughout project implementation and enjoyed excellent working relationships
with their counterparts. The key implementation issues (such as counterpart funding and
implementation delays of works) and proposed actions by the previous supervision missions
were generally followed up by subsequent missions.

5.1.7 The main omission in supervision was in regard to M&E. For WISMP supervision
should have paid more attention to the key performance indicator monitoring and included
KPIs earlier in the series of Implementation Status Reports (ISRs). For NTB-WRMP the
absence of any worthwhile design or arrangements for M&E was continuously ignored. At
the MTR the main recommendations were that an M&E system should be established, that
there should be mainstreaming of poor and gender issues and that the project should have an
overall work plan. None of these recommendations were implemented.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

5.1.8. Based on the ratings of (a) and (b) above, overall Bank Performance for WISMP 1
was moderately satisfactory, and that for NTB-WRMP is moderately satisfactory as well.

5.2         Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.1. The Government of Indonesia, through the responsible ministries and local
governments, demonstrated throughout the project a strong commitment to the water
resources and irrigation sector reforms supported by WISMP and NTB-WRMP. The National
Steering Committee for Water Resources (NSCWR) through its secretariat in Bappenas
provided strong leadership during project preparation and implementation. MoF and local
governments concerned provided sufficient counterpart funding with an innovative parallel
financing mechanism in the later stage of the project. MoPW, MoHA and MoA coordinated
effectively in project design, overseeing and supporting critical aspects of implementation,
and provided staff and resources for the projects. Local governments at provincial and
Kabupaten levels created favorable enabling environment for the projects, by issuing required
guiding regulations, establishing multi-stakeholder organizations and providing necessary
budgets for project implementation and O&M. Delays in providing the essential enabling
legislation postponed the start of both projects by almost two years. During implementation,
progress was repeatedly slowed by the late release of government budget (DIPA), which is a
chronic problem. In many cases there was a lack of staff continuity which was particularly
unfortunate since the heavy training input provided was thereby often largely wasted. For
WISMP, TA support was also less than fully satisfactory with a heavier concentration on
central agencies and inadequate TA support provided in the field to kabupaten staff and
WUAs/WUAFs. For NTB-WRMP, which had a proportionately heavier TA support, the
situation was more satisfactory. Government performance is therefore rated as moderately
satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency (or Agencies) Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

5.2.2 There were many implementing agencies involved in the WISMP1 and the NTB-
WRMP projects and performance varied a lot across the board. Generally speaking, Part A
implementing agencies performed relatively poorly partly because of the lack of clarity and
delay in issuance of basin management regulations. The majority of the implementing
agencies (including PMUs and PIUs) made dedicated efforts to overcome the many
challenges and address the practical issues emerging in order to minimize project delays. The
three sectoral PIUs at different levels worked effectively together for institutionalizing PIM
(Part B of the project), under coordination of NPMU, PPMUs and KPMUs, while for Part A
good progress was also made in capacity & institutional building with some linkage to tackle
practical issues such as water allocation and flood protection in selected basins. The
development of rice intensification, improved marketing and agri-business capability in NTB-
WRMP has proved successful and provides a model for replication under WISMP2. A
number of aspects need to be improved in the follow-up program (WISMP2). These include:
avoiding the over-rapid transfer of staff which disrupts implementation and severely reduces
the impact of training and capacity building; strengthening work programming and budget
preparation/release; establishing an adequate and practical M&E system and ensuring its
effective use in tracking project progress and outcomes; and arranging for timely recruitment
and fuller utilization of TA consultants. Despite these criticisms in view of both projects‟
complexity and reform orientation guided by evolving regulations, the implementing
agencies‟ overall performance is rated satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

5.2.3 Based on the above considerations, the overall Borrower performance is rated
moderately satisfactory.

6.      Lessons Learned

6.1. The WISMP Program was envisaged as a challenging and adaptable program to support
the long-term institutional development and capacity building in Indonesia‟s water resources
and irrigation sector. The Phase I project, with a quite complex design and changing policy
environment in the course of implementation, achieved plausible results and yielded
important lessons which could benefit the design and implementation of the second phase
project and follow-up investments in the country and similar operations elsewhere. These
lessons are summarized briefly below:

6.2. Institutional development/reform-oriented investments in the water sector should take a
long-term program approach synchronized with government policy reform implementation,
and with flexible design which can adapt to evolution of the policy environment. Accordingly
the project design should be kept simple and realistic in terms of project targets;

6.3. A participatory approach in basin water resources and irrigation management improves
decision-making effectiveness, and enhances ownership of the solutions by different
stakeholders. The alignment between irrigation sector reform interventions and agricultural
production activities of interest to communities creates incentives for active involvement of
beneficiaries and enhances program sustainability;

6.4. Inter-agency collaboration and coordination proved essential not only for project
implementation but also for ensuring project impact and sustainability, as demonstrated in the
integration of irrigation sector reform interventions and agricultural productivity improvement,
which has created incentives for farmer participation and has enhanced project sustainability;

6.5. Role-sharing, in a decentralization policy environment, between national, provincial and
district agencies for basin water resources and irrigation management for national
basins/schemes should be structured through legal arrangements, instead of being addressed
through ad hoc agreements.

6.6. It‟s critical to retain a stable team of government staff during the implementation period as
a high rate of staff rotation in government services resulted in a continuous need to train new
people and transfer knowledge, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the capacity-building
program under the projects;

6.7. Adopting advance procurement, flexible contracting and parallel financing arrangements
for counterpart funds was proven to be effective in enhancing implementation readiness,
achieving the annual program targets. And the results would have been better if the budget
approval and release were more timely; and

6.8. M&E indicator design should be specific and easy to measure, and be able to reflect PDO
achievement. M&E implementation arrangements should be included as an integral part of
project management with designated staff, and M&E results should be utilized in supporting
decision-making (incl. making timely adjustments in project implementation and resource
allocations).

Project Benefits


1.       Quantifiable benefits: The WISMP I and NTB-WRMP NTB has provided more
reliable and efficient water delivery to irrigated agriculture, and generated confidence among
farmers/irrigators to adopt and implement improved agricultural practices. As a result, the
agricultural productivity has been increased. Specifically the increase of crop production
would be achieved through (i) enhanced cropping intensity; (ii) crop yield increases; and (iii)
changes in crop patterns shifting to high value produce. To calculate the above types of the
project benefit from the incremental crop production, crop budgets have been prepared for the
“with project? and “without project? situations. Benefit aggregation is based on physical
achievement by year and incorporate the cropping pattern changes.
2.       Non-quantifiable benefits: Other benefits not accounted for in the analysis include
(i) cost savings from appropriate and timely river infrastructure maintenance; (ii) cost savings
relating to improved management of flooding and mitigation of associated loss; (3) efficiency
gains from institutional strengthening and development associated with the programme; and
(4) conflict reduction between upstream and downstream water users. Under the project, there
are interventions to improve management of the river basins in Component 1, it is not
possible to measure the individual effects of these capital improvement costs, but the benefits
accrued are assumed to be captured in the increased agricultural productivity under
Component 2.
3.       The data sources from for quantifying Project benefits. The crop yield increase, crop
intensity increase, and/or changes in cropping patterns from paddy to higher valued crops
were derived from data collected of various sources17. In addition to the data collected from
WISMP-1 implementation, various other sources of information on incremental agricultural
production were taken into account from data gathered from several agencies and reports. In
each case, the impact of the project is compared to a without-project situation, with
incremental benefits generated from (i) crop yield increase; (ii) Cropping intensity increase;
and/or (iii) changes in cropping patterns (from paddy to high value crops). In addition,
separate estimates were made for Java and off–Java to reflect the general differences in
productivity in the two areas. The production parameters used a weighted average for the
Java and non-Java to get an overall set of parameters to apply to all project areas. The
without project assumes all conditions will remain the same. A sizeable effect of the project
on cropping intensities is shown in Table 2. The increases on Java at 3.4% were lower than
off-Java at 5.2%.18

   Based on the surveys carried out by the NPMU and the NPIU. In addition, in 2009 the Padjadjaran
University made a comparative analysis based on surveys in participating kabupatens. These data
were incorporated in the various reports (including Government ICR).

   NTB was not included in the analysis as no systematic and verifiable data available for NTB (see
Main Report Section 3.2.20).

4.       The yield changes also show a somewhat higher gain on off-Java compared to Java as
shown in Table 3. Off-Java has a lower base making the likelihood of a larger relative
increase. In absolute measures, the increase in yields on Java and off-Java were estimated to
be the same at an increase of 0.50 MT increase for both regions. While there is an apparent
productive advantage in growing SRI, compared to a regular rice crop, it is believed to have a
rather limited potential area because of the high levels of organic inputs that are limited in
quantities necessary for more extensive use. Maize yields increase 50% more off-Java than on
Java, perhaps reflecting a comparative advantage in Maize production off-Java.

5.      The projected cropping patterns as a result of project interventions show some
variation. As one might expect, increases in rice area is limited on both Java and off-Java
because they are already at a very high rate in irrigated areas. The SRI shows a four-fold
increase in cropped areas on both Java and off-Java because of the low baseline planted areas.
Soybeans show a 50 percent estimated increase in cropped area off-Java compared to less
than 10 percent for Java. This difference may reflect the acceptance of soybeans as a high-
valued crop off-Java. Maize showed no change on Java and a minor increase, 2.7 %, off-
Java.


Economic Analysis
6.      World Bank commodity price projections (2015-2020) were used to estimate farm
gate prices in constant 2010 terms, along with incorporating the World Bank current price
information. Based on the above methodologies for quantifying project benefit, incremental
benefits generated directly from total project costs (including Component 1 and Component
2) of project intervention are identified and quantified. Cash flows of benefits and costs are
projected over the project economic life to estimate the base case Net Present Value (NPV) at
a discount rate of 12%. Based on the aggregated cash flows and the total project costs
(including costs under component 1 and component 3), the whole project ERR is estimated at
23 % with NPV at US$ 74.58 million.

                                             42
Sensitivity Analysis
7.       Key factors influencing project results are (1) project cost increases and (2) decrease
in the price of rice – the major farm commodity in the project area. Sensitivity test has been
conducted on these factors with the results below. This sensitivity analysis shows that the
factor having the significant effect on the EIRR is the decrease in rice price. However,
economic price of rice used in the analysis is based on the Bank projection, which has
reflected the declining trend of rice price. The EIRR in general is therefore resilient to
negative changes in major output price decline and project cost increase.

Financial Analysis
8.      Financial analysis can only be applied to the income generating entities. For farmers‟
households, an income analysis has been prepared, using crop budgets and farm models under
with and without project situations to gauge the financial attractiveness to the farmers. The
results of this analysis are very much affected by farm size. The average farm sizes
throughout Indonesia have become smaller. Between 1995 and 2007, the average farm size on
Java changed from 0.493 to 0.36 hectares. Over the same period of time, the average farm
size off-Java changed from 1.491 to 1.347 hectares. For the purposes of these household
income estimates, we are using the farm area of 0.360 hectare per farm on Java and 1.347
hectares per farm household off-Java.

9.      The results of the farm household income analysis show a substantial increase in
farmers‟ income from improved crop production with the implementation of the project.
Within the Component 2 (PIM) the relative change in farm household income on Java was
32%, and the increase in farm household income off-Java was estimated to increase by 27%.
10.     The project is therefore financially attractive to farmers participating in the project,
and the substantial increases in beneficiary farmers‟ incomes has provided adequate
incentives and ability for farmers to take over responsibility for O&M of on-farm irrigation
system through the WUAs/WUAFs.

11. For NTB-WRMP, though no systematic and verifiable data available from M&E, based
on the various reports and field visits it is generally believed that the crop yield and cropping
pattern increases achieved under the project were higher than in off-Java areas under
WISMPI. As such, adopting the same approach for economic analysis and using non-Java
data for crop production, it was conservatively estimated that the ERR for NTB-WRMP was
at 21%, with similar sensitivity results.
Fiscal Analysis
12.      In comparison with without project situation, the fiscal impact of both WISMP 1 and
NTB-WRMP NTB is largely positive as the Project introduced participatory operation and
maintenance (O&M) practices for target irrigation schemes. The funding for O&M for tertiary
canal systems after rehabilitation has been covered by the WUAs and WUAFs, while the
O&M costs for the improved secondary and main canals, which are noticeable lower after
rehabilitation, are covered by the government as per current water sector policies.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR

The Directorate General of Water Resources, Ministry of Public Works contracted the
consulting firm to assist in preparing a Final Report (Implementation Completion Result
Report (ICR) dated December 2010) 19 on the project. This presents a great deal of data on
project implementation and shows a high degree of consistency with the Bank‟s ICR findings.
The Final Report/ICR main text extends to some 150 pages and is on-file. The following
summarizes the Final Report/ICR‟s highlights, main findings and lessons learned.

Financial and Economic Analysis.           A detailed financial and economic analysis concluded
that the project was relatively successful with attractive returns to farmers and an adequate
economic return to Indonesia. Sensitivity analysis showed that the project was relatively
insensitive to the sensitivity tests made.

Rating of Bank Supervision – Satisfactory. World Bank carried out its role very well, in
giving supervision work on the subject of periodic technical and non technical. The World
Bank is also responsible for providing recommendations to the provincial and district
governments in improving the role of women and poverty reduction.

Lesson Learned:

(a). Implementation of a good irrigation perspective for GP3A and armed with training in
design and operation and maintenance will help implementation of the irrigation network to
be more effective and more sustainable, have a positive impact and improve transparency in
the use of surface water or ground water. The status of GP3A helps to increase and prioritize
maintenance and repair of irrigation system design with good quality. Farmer irrigation fees
and their labor contributions, will alleviate the cost of operation and maintenance and minor
rehabilitation. Use of IPAIR implemented by aid of GP3A encourages transparency.
Decentralization will help the progress of implementation of more transparency in
participatory irrigation management of IPAIR funds;

(b). For rehabilitation/repair of irrigation, both the obligation of central government,
provinces, districts must be implemented with transparency, including GP3A. The latter have
a role/participate in all aspects of development, finance, from the tendering process until the
execution and the work is completed. Regulation of the governors and ministers circular is
required for participatory irrigation repair.
(c). Management of water allocation both for business and for agriculture carried out with
regulations and legislation in force today, and must be fair and transparent, both surface water
and ground water. Water allocation should be effective and efficient for the necessary
understanding and cooperative operation and agreement that the water source should be
adequate and environmentally sustainable. Relevant agencies should carry out analysis of the
water quality of the potential sources of water. The above tasks need to be undertaken in
accordance with job description O&M duties at central, provincial and district levels,
according to the authority of each.

(d). The main activities in the implementation of participatory irrigation covers O&M and
repair/rehabilitation using net base budget (NBB). This needs the necessary amount of budget

including annual periodic financing from IPAIR through GP3A, especially for O&M and
expected according to the NBB. As for rehabilitation activities funds can be obtained through
the state budget but needs to consider cost recovery.

(e). Implementation of WISMP I still has a concentration on capacity building activities of
water resources and participatory irrigation. Land acquisition is not yet happening. Later land
will be required, especially for water resources and participatory irrigation. From the
observations obtained in the field, a considerable expanse of padi drying area (3000-5000
M2) for advanced GP3A who already have heuler (rice huller) with an area of about 2000 M2
while driel (grain dryers) are damaged. For the future there is a need to anticipate land
acquisition, and include GP3A to get involved and NPIU NPMU included and a land
acquisition committee formed by members 50% government and 50% of non-governmental.

(f). M&E activities should be conducted by an independent team after WISMP I finished. The
task that needs to be done by the team carrying out existing M and E contained in the lessons
learned include the institutional, participatory irrigation benefits measurable / not measurable,
cost effectiveness and marketing policies and supporting regulations in the implementation of
the M and E should be done sequentially, among others, the baseline survey.

(g). Training activities are still needed. Training needs surveys, competency studies, task
analysis and performance analysis, the success of training, if conducted in accordance with
the needs using Bottom-up TAN approach.

(h). Priority in provision of resources assigned to each river area is determined by
Government and local governments in accordance with their authority. Consideration should
also be given to make sure that assistance is provided fairly without penalizing any group of
farmers.

(i). Both the SDA and TKPSDA boards, are large institutions with a very large number of
members, making it difficult to reach a unanimous decision. The secretariat of the
Board/TKPSDA must be strong and able to prepare materials for key sessions of the
Board/TKPSDA.

(j). Land conversion from irrigated rice into other uses needs carefully technical scrutiny, as
this affects their food availability. Regarding food security policy, this should be considered a
policy of food sovereignty, with reliance on imports and other rice producing countries
reduced.

(k). The State's Asset Management is important. Issues that need to be considered include
whether the management should be part of BMN, not only focused on inventory and
registration of state assets, but more broad, encompassing both use and security.

(l). With the loss of the Partnership Sub Dit NSPM preparation tasks (Norma Standard
Guidelines Manual) partnerships and the role of the community in natural resources
management must be accommodated in other Sub-DIT, for example in the Sub Directorate of
Settings.

(m). Incidence Sub Dit Dit Bina Settings in PSDA, suggesting the need for close cooperation
with the law and as amended by invitation or not to overlap each other waiting for the
completion of tasks.

(n). PPIU in 2007 had no echelon V (subjective) staff. This should be considered for cadre -
forming, and to allow career advancement.

(o). Implementation of WISMP by the Indonesian Government was mainly assisted by
funding from World Bank. Need to establish a coordination body to further perfect WISMP
implementation from planning to development.

Conclusions and Suggestions:

(a) Coordination:      Coordination is the core problem in both SDA Board of National,
Provincial and Regency/Municipality and in Natural Resource Management Coordination
Team based on river basin (TKPSDA). A region may have has only a Provincial Water
Resources Council and do not consider it necessary to have TKPSDA.
Suggestions: Because of the nature of their duties Dewan SDA shall establish and formulate
natural resource management policy (tasks, staffing) and TKPSDA more on the
implementation of plans and programs. Coordination at the central conducted by the NSC and
NPMU can work well with coordination meetings (workshops), guidelines, but the
coordination of the provincial/district undertaken by PPMU / KPKU still needs improvement.
Coordination meetings are often not fully attended by PPIU / KPIU related offices;
preparation of the AWP is supposed to be consolidated at the PPMU, more often PPIU /
KPIU delivered directly to NPMU. Necessary monitoring and follow-up by NPMU assisted
by consultants, for coordination at the provincial / district got a favorable response from PPIU
/ KPIU. In order to facilitate the coordination can be done through their respective provincial
website.

(b) Institutions:  Based on the PP. 41 of 2007, about the structure of the Organization as a
UPTD Balai PSDA may only have one Head of Administration and Functional.
Suggestions: Need a review of clausule PP. 41/2007 because based on the fact the extent of
the working area of a Hall of PSDA and magnitude of the task that must be carried at least the
required 2 (two) head section and Kasub Bag TU as long as it lasts.

(c) Administrative Barriers: Almost everywhere in both the provincial and district there are
bureaucratic obstacles, especially regarding the budget. DIPA disbursements are realized
slowly and often towards the end of the fiscal year, so this is clearly affecting the smooth
implementation of the work.
Suggestions: DIPA delay (Bappeda) makes it impossible to carry out the program perfectly,
or sometimes cannot even be implemented at all, because of lack of time. This leads to a lack
of synchronization between programs. The mechanism is the DIPA Bappeda 'Program Budget
69' (Bangda). In this case the Directorate of Budget (Kemt. Finance) and DG.Banda (Kemt.
DN) need to consider changing the mechanism.

(d) Land Conversion:         With increasing population and the inevitable development of
technical irrigated rice, land conversion into residential land and plantations and other
interests is happening rapidly.
Suggestions: The problem of food security should be a focus of concern, setting a land use
change ban.

(e) Shortage of Human Resources. Frequent rotation and moving staff caused a chain effect,
also involving decision-making officials. For example in the Office of Food Crops in Lahat
regency over a short time the head was replaced three times, resulting in a three times
replacement of the KDP.
Suggestions: Man Power Planning should be a reference so that each movement in human
resources is part of a planned rotation from the beginning, not less important is the formation
of cadres.

(f) Public awareness campaign. Increased public awareness of water resource management
is objective of the WISMP program, which is not always easy to achieve, especially the
Parliament target group

                                              52
Suggestions: Intensification of socialization and lobbying, especially with the Parliament,
because they have a very strategic role in the issuance of regulations concerning the provision
of funds in natural resources management.

(g) Division of Responsibilities:     For resource management issues in the province, some
agencies are directly related to natural resources, both the central and the local agencies. The
division of roles between the two should be clear.
Suggestions: KSO, SKKS and SPKS Cooperation outlined in the MoU which was followed
by OCA as the details of its follow-up. The type and amount of the value of work performed
GP3A (KSO, SKKS, SPKS) in construction as well as the OP is still relatively small,
although previously set forth in the MOU / KSO. This is because the 'bargaining position'
GP3A is very weak, because the initiative came from the office.
There should be a minimum limit (e.g. 20%) of the value of the work carried out by GP3A
(KSO, SKKS, SPKS).

(h) Community Assistance Team (TPM):             There is a need for members of the TPM, since
the TPM is vital for all field activities, problems, organization, agriculture and training to help
them build GP3A.
Suggestions: Ideally, each village is available a power TPM that it knows about the technical
organization of agriculture and good communication techniques with farmers. Use of existing
PPL power can take precedence.

(i) Training:    There should be training for the implementation of the task of managing
GP3A, so that they can be independent in matters of organization and financial administration
of design, construction and O&M. Smooth transition from participatory for GP3A to
independent.
Suggestions: Training Need Assessment (TNA). Some GP3A complained that the training
provided is often tedious. Before creating or implementing training programs first conduct a
TNA, so that appropriate training is carried out as needed.

(j) Water User Association Federation (WUAF or GP3A): GP3A as a mix of WUA (P3A) is
an asset and economic potential to be developed. Distribution like stimulant to them as to
Gapoktan, should be the concern of all parties.
Suggestions: It should be equal treatment of local government for the establishment of funds
to GP3A as those committed against Gapoktan.

(k) Irrigation Commission (KOMIR): Irrigation Commission must work optimally, because
the members of the KOMIR still concurrent with other positions or try to own, but its
existence is very strategic in GP3A independence.
Suggestions: It should be the policy of NPMU to PPIU and KPIU to rearrange the setting,
duties and functions of members KOMIR.

(l) System of Rice Intensification (SRI): SRI has proved to be one type of farming that is
environmentally friendly and water saving, as well as short-duration and able to provide good
quality food in the future. From the test results in 18 district data showed that the results
achieved on average 6.4 to 9.72 tons/ha.
Suggestions: It should be an obligation of all parties, both Government and farmers to
maintain conditions conducive for production and marketing.

(m) Funds Absorption:       Absorption rate of funds as much as 17 PIU Province / Regency /
City is relatively low, especially PIU, Bappeda and the Department of Agriculture due to the
late receipt of DIPA, because the use of Budget 69 and finance ministries that have special
rules for disbursements.
Suggestions: Need to improve budget management, particularly in the use of budget Bangda
DG 69 by the Ministry of the Interior. Government budgeting should be related to the

                                                53
Ministry of budget. Other than that there should be an evaluation of the parties that
participated in the program WISMP mainly on activities that fund absorption is very low.

(o) Budget for DG Bangda: Using the number of budget 69 (Kemen Budget Finance) that
the process is not simple and the National politic conditions that interfere with the system
policy of the government budget.
Suggestions: Budgeting through a mechanism that further facilitates the process of receiving
good DIPA to Central, Provincial and District levels.

(p) Agribusiness: Agribusiness activity has not been implemented seriously, because GP3A
did not understand yet the market potential it contains.
Suggestions: Need intensification of agriculture-related training, business methods, the rules
of doing business, organization, preparation of reporting systems, etc.

(q) Report Consolidation: Not yet optimal coordination and reporting system between the
PPMU and KPMU resulting lack of information obtained dikabupaten activities.
Suggestions: Progress Report. The report not only presents the physical progress and
budgeting alone, but also the course of program implementation, the obstacles that occur in
the field which are resolved or not, and issues arising. PPMU given a role to arrange periodic
'Consolidated Report' and implement monitoring and evaluation (ME) and make annual
reports. The format of the 'Reports' needs to be prepared by NPIU.

(r). Improved Budget System:       Need to improve budgeting systems, financial reporting
mechanisms and financial monitoring. It is expected that the financial M&E should produce
solutions to improve financial management systems.

(s) Coordination: Implementation of WISMP by the Indonesian government was mainly
assisted by funding from World Bank. Need to establish a body of coordination to perfect
implementation of WISMP from planning to development.

Annex 8. Comments of Co-financiers on the ICR

European Union (EU)

(a) Sustainability is not sufficiently discussed in our opinion. Many of the result level
indicators are based on government decisions and institutional arrangements - such as
establishment of Provincial Water Resources Council, Water User Association Federations,
etc.. These are important indicators, but we would find it useful to have more information on
the capacities of the institution and bodies supported by the project to manage water
resources as envisioned by the project beyond the implementation phase. If there is interest
from the parties concerned, the EU Delegation could field monitors to look at the
sustainability of the project results in the near future.

(b) Monitoring and Evaluation (section 2.3): We would appreciate if reference could be made
to the EU contribution to the monitoring and evaluation of the project. The EU fielded a
monitoring for short term mission in 2007 and hired a team of experts to contribute to the
evaluation of the project in late 2010

(c) Poverty aspects (sections 3.1.3 and 5.1.4): We think that attention to the poverty issues
during the project design was relevant considering poverty issues in NTB province and the
importance of access to water for farming communities who are in a situation of poverty.
Poverty alleviation was not referred to as a specific objective or result of the project, however
a “particular emphasis on the poor? was foreseen. We do not think this made the project
objective over ambitious.

Netherlands Embassy, Jakarta

(a) WISMP 1 has been designed as a state of the art program for Integrated Water Resources
management of River Basins and for Participatory Irrigation Management. The project was
part of the overall reform process of the water sector in Indonesia. Success of such a program
relies heavily on institutional change and capacity building processes at decentralized levels
of government and of local communities and organizations (notably Water Users
Associations). The project was implemented by the Government and project implementation
has been rated by the ICR as moderately satisfactory. The report mentions as one of the
factors that the TA support concentrated on the central agencies and was inadequate toward
the district level staff and the Water Users Associations.

(b) In combination with the „over-rapid‟ transfer of staff, the insufficient funding of district
agencies and the changes in administrative structure and mandates, the results of the project at
provincial, district and local level have been only partial and are still very fragile. There exists
a need for „continued support and nurturing‟, „further clarity and agreement on role sharing
and financing‟, additional „government regulation‟ etc. The report expects that during
WISMP2 these aspects can be dealt with. In combination with the extension of the project
period and the downward revision of some key project targets (notably financial sustainability
of irrigation) it would appear that the results of WISMP I are as yet far less sustainable than
envisaged.

(c) Although the WISMP I is part of the overall reform process of the water sector, the ICR
does not address the relevance and effectiveness of the project in this context. The articulation
of the project with other donor efforts (notably the ADB co-funded PISP) is not analyzed. An
assessment of such an aspect should have been included in the ICR.
