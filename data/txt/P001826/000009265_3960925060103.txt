GORGOL NOIR IRRIGATION PROJECT
(Credit 1068-MAU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Gorgol Noir
Irrigation Project, for which Credit 1068-MAU was approved in September
1980 for the sum of US$15.0 million. The Credit was almost fully disbursed
and was closed in March 1987.
This PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Division of the Sahelian
Department, Africa Region (AF5AG) and the IBRD/FAO Cooperative Programme,
and was based on: a review of Staff Appraisal Report No. 2517a-MAU dated
August 21, 1980; the Development Credit Agreement and Project Agreement,
both dated November 21, 1980; the draft PCR prepared by SONADER's Gorgol
Noir Irrigation Project Directorate and dated March 18, 1988; review of
supervision reports; and visits  to  the  project site and discussions with
project staff as well as with SONADER Head Office staff in June 1987.
No further evaluation of this project has been done by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED).   The  draft report was sent to the
Borrower and cofinanciers for comment on October 7, 1988. Comments from
the Saudi Fund for Development have been taken into account, or answered in
the margin of the telex which appears as an annex in the report.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Mauritania
Gorgol Noir Irrigation Project
(Credit 1068-MAU)
EVALUATION SUMARY
1.        The Project was the third Bank Group operation in the irzigation
subsector in Mauritania. It was designed to provide irrigation atvd land
development for some 3,600 ha, with the objectives of reducing the
country's dependence on food imports and increasing the incomes and living
standards of some 4,600 families by stabilizing their agriculture. The
Project, as planned at appraisal, included: (i) construction of a dam and
water conveyance works; (ii) construction of the Gorgol perimeter.
including irrightion canals, drains, land levelling, access roads,
agricultural inpu:-' and vehicles, and community buildings and facilities
(schools, dispen _..is, etc.); (iii) provision of soil preparation and
threshing services, inputs, credit, and extension and marketing services;
(iv) technical assistance and equipment and vehicles for execution and
initial operation of the Project.
2.        Due to lengthy negotiations, late award of contracts, and
problems with some of the nine external financiers, project effectiveness
was delayed by almost a year (from January 1981 to November 1981.) A
number of serious problems surfaced in the early implementation phases
(paras 25-27, 28 (a)). The most important of these was a major cost
overrun of which it was estimated in mid-1982 that, were it allowed to
continue, it would amount to 52Z by project's end. The cost overrun on the
dam and conveyance works was not major and arose mainly from the
aforementioned delay before project effectiveness. The more serious
overrun involved the tertiary network and on-farm development, and arose
from: the abandonment of the force account approach, which in any case had
been severely under-costed; substantial increases in prices and quantities
over appraisal estimates; and the inclusion of facilities, machinery and
staff not originally foreseen.
3.        Since co-financiers and Government ruled out additional financing
to meet the increased costs, the Project underwent a substantial
reformulation in 1983 (para 28 (b)). This involved a significant reduction
in the area to be irrigated and major revisions in the plans for tertiary
networks and on-farm works, in the settlement program and in agricultural
development. The dam retained the same desiga, but the primary, secondary
and tertiary irrigation and drainage networks and roads were scaled back to
serve a net area of about 2,000 ha (reduced from the 3,600 ha proposed
originally). The settlement program brought in 1,100 families (instead of
4,400 at appraisal), and under the agricultural development component, all
farming operations avre made the responsibility of beneficiaries. No rice
mill was constructe. and technical assistance was reduced.



- vi -
4.        The different components performed differently because of the
changes made in the project's content and scope (paras 29-34). The dam was
completed according to original specifications, as were the main conveyance
canals.  The secondary irrigation canal network was only partly
constructed.  The tertiary drainage network and land levelling works were
only carried out on an area of 600 ha, as against 2,000 during project
reformulation.  All of the planned feeder roads were constructed along the
main canals.  While settlement and agricultural development were slowed by
delays in delivery of irrigation works, the second season of irrigated rice
gave an average yield of 4.6 t/ha for wet season rice, a result that
slightly exceeded appraisal estimates. Extension services and technical
assistance performed adequately overall.
5.        The first phase of the Project is clearly a failure in economic
terms. The estimated ERR for the overall development program is 32.
6.        The major project objectives, i.e., reducing the country's
dependence on food imports and ensuring an adequate income to
settler-farmers, are likely to be achieved. Also, valuable experience was
gained in implementing this first major irrigation project in Mauritania,
with probable benefit to future projects to be carried out under the
'post-dam" plan for development of the Senegal River Valley.
7.        The major lessons learned are the following:
(a) There are no short-cuts to having final designs based on accurate
base data for estimating project costs and construction
schedules;
(b) a large number of donors is best avoided but, if this is
unavoidable, firm commitments should be obtained before final
negotiations;
(c) the project would have benefitted from greater legal input, both
in design and supervision;
(d) irrigation projects in Mauritania should be monitored regularly
with appropriate modifications made by a strong Bank supervision
team, as was the case with this Project.



MAURITANIA
GORGOL NOIR IRRIGATION PROJECT (CREDIT 1068-MAU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        Mauritania's economic performance during the 19709 was
characterized by a high investment rate (22 to 322 of GDP) combined with
slow growth (annual GDP growth rates of 1.0 to 1.5Z at constant prices).
The near stagnation of the economy was due to prolonged drought, misguided
investment policies and the war over the former Spanish Sahara. This
period was followed by the fall of the 18-year old government and the
country's withdrawal from the war.
2.        An IMF-supported stabilization program was launched in 1978 and
continued in 1980, but the decline continued through the l9POs due to the
drop in world prices for iron ore, a worsening of the drought in 1983/84
and the mounting debt service burden (which reached a projected 402 of
export earnings on debts contracted up to the end of 1984). Over the
decade ending in 1983, the Mauritanian economy grew by an average of 2.32,
barely keeping pace with population growth.
3.        The Government's response to this situation was to launch a
comprehensive Economic and Financial Recovery Program for the period
1985/88 in collaboration with the Consultative Group of donors for
Mauritania. This program involves a range of economic policy adjustments
and institutional reform measures, including flexible exchange rates,
encouragement of the private sector, reform of the banking, public and
para-public sectors, and an investument program giving priority to rural
development, mining, infrastructure development and public services. It is
still too early to judge the program's effects, but prelimin&ry results
appear encouraging.
4.        The Government continues to place high priority on the
development of irrigation in order to both diversify the economy and reduce
its dependence on food imports.  The unreliable rainfall does not allow
rainfed agriculture to be considered as a viable alternative for reaching
these goals. The country's irrigation potential is about 150,000 ha
(140,000 along the Senegal River and 10,000 ha in the Gorgol Valley) of
which only about 13,000 ha have been developed. The latter includes about
4,000 ha developed and irrigated by individual farmer with almost no
Government help.
5.        The Bank's association with the 4rrigation sub-sector dates back
to June 1974 when, on the basls of a UNDP-financed feasibility study, a
US$ 1.1 million IDA credit (S-16-MAU) was provided to finance preparation
of the final designs of two dams and the first phase of the irrigation
development of the Gorgol valley. In FY77, an IDA credit for US$ 3.5
million was made available for the SONADER Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 694-MAU) which was intended to strengthen the project preparation



and implementation capacity of SONADER (Soci4td nationale pour le
developpement rural), which took over these functions from the Rural
Engineering Department of the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR).
6.        Other Bank 'roup operations I.n Mauritania in the irrigation
sector include: the Gorgol Irrigation Project presented herein (Credit
1068-MAU; US$ 15.0 million, 1981); the Second Technical Assistance to the
Rural Sector (Credit 1414-MAU; USS 8.1 million, 1983); and the Small Scale
Irrigation Project (1571-MAU; US$ 7.5 million; 1985).
7.        The Gorgol Irrigation Project was designed to provide irrigation
and land development for some 3,600 ha at a total cost of US$ 93.2 million
with the objectives of reducing the country's dependence on food imports
and stabilizing the agriculture and thus increasing incomes and living
standards of some 4,600 farm families. As expected at appraisal, the
Project was completed in September 1986 and the IDA credit closed in March
1987.
8.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) is based on a review of the
Staff Appraisr.l Report (SAR) 2517a-MAU dated August 21, 1980; the
Development Credit Agreement tDCA) and Project Agreement (PA), both dated
November 21, 1980; the draft PCR prepared by the Project Directorate of
SONADER; and the project supervision reports. It was prepared following
visite to the project site and discussions with project staff as well as
SONADER head office staff in June 1987.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Identification
9.        Irrigation development of the Gorgol River Valley (see map) was
always favored by the Government because (i) it would increase and
stabilize Mauritanian cereal production and reduce dependence on food
imports; (ii) it could be the nucleus of development in the Southeastern
region which lacks other development possibilities; and (iii) it did not
depend on international agreements or water control structures in other
countries as was the case with development of the Senegal River. Project
identification started in 1971 with studies financed by UNDP. On the basis
of the resulting preparation report, IDA financed under the Credit S-16-MAU
the preparation of final designs for two proposed dams (El Bir and Foum
Gleita) and for the first phase of the irrigation development program.
However, when this work was completed in April 1975, the Bank refused to
appraise the Project for the following reasons:
a)   There were serious doubts about the technical suitability of
the design of the El Bir dam, and further topographic and
engineering studies were deemed necessary;
b)   On the basis of past experience, it was felt that the
Mauritanian irrigation development agencies did not have the



managerial capacity needed to handle medium to large-scale
irrigation projects; and
c)   While a preliminary evaluation of the whole 10,000 ha
project indicated that it would be viable, the first phase
involving the construction of both dams and the development
of 3,800 ha was expected to yield a very low rate of return.
10.       A revised first phase, limited to the construction of only one
dam (Foum Gleita) and the downstream development of 3,600 ha, was then
identified on the basis of a Bank desk study and a field visit by an FAO/CP
mission. This alternative was accepted by the Government after extensive
discussions with the Bank and FAO.
Preparation
11.       The additional investigations and feasibility studies required t,
prepare this revised first phase were supported by Credit 694-MAU (US$ 3.5
million) which also aimed at strengthening the managerial capacity of the
newly established SONADER. Preliminary feasibility studies for the
irrigation scheme were completed by Italian consultants in February 1978
and final documents including technical specifications, tender documents,
execution plans and agricultural and socio-economic studies, were submitted
in September 1978. A special study of the design and specifications of the
Foum Gleita dam by a panel of dam experts was completed in April 1979.
Pre-Appraisal
12.       The Project was pre-appraised in March 1978 and the pre-appraisal
report was distributed in May 1978. The Project, as then conceived, had a
total cost estimated at US$ 52 million net of taxes, with the cost per
family of beneficiaries at USS 11,000 and an ERR around 7Z.
13.       Th' low rate of return was attributed to: a) the early stage of
development of the sector, with the resulting need for a long lead time to
settle farmers, and the high management and training costs involved in
building up the executing agency; and b) the exorbitant cost of civil works
(which would affect any major investment in Mauritania), mainly due to the
high cost of importing technical and managerial skills, the need to
transport equipment and materials over long distances on poor roads, lack
of local maintenance and support services for equipment, and the lack of
competition among contractors.
14.       The request to the Bank's Loan Committee for permission te
appraise the Project was justified on the grounds that:
a)   the Bank had a long prior association with the Gorgol
Project and had financed much of the preparation work;



- 4 -
b)   the objectives of the Bank's technical assistance to SONADER
had been met and it was now a viable organization capable of
implementing the Project;
c)   there was a shortage of investment opportunities in
Mauritania, particularly in the Southern Region;
d)   on account of the ready availability of funds as grant aid
and soft loans, an appreciable proportion of the Gorgol
project costs would not give rise to finance charges.
15.       The Region was authorized to appraise the Project (despite its
low rate of return and high investment cost per family), with the provision
that the Project should be reviewed at appraisal, in view of the special
conditions prevailing in Mauritania.
Appraisal
16.       Appraisal took place in September/October 1978.  On the basis of
the report of the panel of dam experts, the pre-appraisal proposal for an
earth-fill dam was replaced by a proposal for a concrete arch dam at Foum
Gleita. The resulting revised designs and cost estimates were to be
available only in April 1979, when project cost estimates would be firmed
up. Slightly higher costs for the irrigation works were also indicated by
the engineering studies which were made available at appraisal. The
economic prices of project outputs (paddy, milled rice, sorghum and maize)
were also revised upwards following appraisal.
17.       The appraisal mission's revised estimate of project costs at that
time was USS 55 million, allowing for increased physical contingencies on
the dam and irrigation costs due to the changes in design. The mission's
preliminary calculation of the project's economic rate of return remained
at about 7Z.  In order to partly bridge the financing gaps that were
evident at this stage, it was proposed to raise IDA's contribution to US$
15 million.
18.       Subsequent updating of project costs on the basis of bids made by
potential contractors for the dam and irrigation works brought the figure
up considerably, to US$ 93.2 (including physical and price contingencies as
well as US$ 0.5 million for refinancing the credit S-16 MAU mentioned
above). After much debate regarding the acceptability of the project's low
ERR, it was decided to consult the Bank's President, Mr. McNamara, before
processing the Project further.
19.       The President very reluctantly agreed to pursue processing of the
Gorgol Irrigation Project on the grounds of:
-    lack of development alternatives for the people of the
region;



-    higher project costs, partly reflecting tied procurement
required by some donors; and
-    lack of basic infrastructure in the area.
20.       After further refinements, the yellow-cover version of the SAR
issued in August, 1980, showed an ERR of 7.4Z.
Project Description
21.       The Project, as planned at appraisal, included the following
componenits (see map):
(i) Dam and Conveyance Works
-    Construction of a concrete arch dam in Foum Gleita with a
maximum height of 37 m and length of 95 m to give a storage
capacity of 500 million m3; and
-    construction of a headreach canal with a maximum head
capacity of 10.73 m3/s and lpngth of 3.6 km along the left
bank, subdividing into a left bank canal reaching the
irrigated area 3.0 km further downstream and a right bank
canal (with a canal bridge) reaching the irrigation area
after 1.9 km.
(ii) Gorgol Irrigated Perimeter
-    Construction of two main canals (26.5 km long), 37 secondary
canals (61 km), 360 km of tertiary canals and 484 km of
drains;
-    on-farm development, including land levelling and access
roads;
-    construction of houses, offices, storehouses, a rice mill,
social infrastructure (schools, mosques, dispensaries, etc.)
and other facilities close to the perimeter; and
-    provision of agricultural equipment and vehicles.
(iii) Agricultural Development
Provision to farmers of soil preparation (ploughing) and
threshing services, and inputs (seeds, pesticides,
fertilizers) on credit, and extension and marketing
services.
(iv) Technical Assistance



- 6 -
Provision of technical assistance and equipment and vehicles
for execution and initial operation of the Project.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Credit Negotiations, Effectiveness and Start-Up
22.       Negotiations for the credit took place on July 30, 1980 follJwing
technical discussions conducted from July 3 - 10, 1980. The Bank's Board
of Directors approved the credit on September 16, 1980 and the agreement
was signed on November 21, 1980. Conditions for effectiveness included, in
addition to the normal legal opinion and authorization and ratification by
Governments the creation of the Gorgol Project Directorate (GDP),
appointment of its director, opening of a special operating account and
deposit of initial amounts by Government, proof of effectiveness of the
agreements with IFAD, IDB, SDF and Libya, and proof of signature of
agreements with ADFAED, FAC, EDF and KFW. 3/
23.       The Project was expected to become effective on January 21, 1981.
By February 1981, compliance with conditions for which the Government was
entirely responsible was well advanced and the only missing document was
the legal opinion. Legal problems persisted, as there were discrepancies
between the financing plans mentioned in the World Bank's Development
Credit Agreement (DCA) and the plans of certain other donors, with respect
to the financing of some components; this was delaying payment to the
contractors and reimbursement of SONADER, which was pushed to the limit of
its own capacity to finance on-going operations.
24.       Finally, on November 19, 1981, the IDA Credit became effective,
thus rescuing the Projec, from the brink of disaster. However, doubts
persisted as to when the Libyan credit would be available and there was no
confirmation about the disbursement of IDB and SDF funds.
25.       Because of the lengthy negotiations and late award of contracts,
the project completion date was put back by one year (as compared with the
date envisaged in the SAR) and the implementation schedule was changed
accordingly. Other minor problems that arose during the start-up of the
Project were:
-    rejection of the site near the dam selected by the
contractors for the work base camp, as SONADER wished to use
the buildings later for its project management unit;
31   see list of acronyms.



- 7 -
-    failure to provide the benchmarks for the topographic survey
in the period specified in the works contract, owing to
delays in the appointment of the chief of the topography
section;
-    inadequate detail in topographic maps (1:5,000 scale, on
which bids were called) resulting in the need for new, more
detailed, surveys before construction could start; and
-    discrepancies between the financial regulations applicable
to the Project and those attached to the tender documents.
26.       Sociological activities commenced satisfactorily and a protocol
was drawn up between the Government and traditional land owners in the
project area on the use of the land to be irrigated under the Project.
Financing difficulties, however, continued to plague the project, with
Libya still not honoring its commitment and IDB deciding not to finance its
share of local expenditures. The Government also failed to make timely
deposits in the project operating account.
27.       The performance of the Gorgol Project Directorate (GPD) was
affected by the problems of achieving a satisfactory disbursement routine
with ten different financing sources. Senior GPD staff, including the
Project Director, were slow to move out to the project site, and compliance
with this project condition was obtained only after a threat by IDA to
suspend disbursements.
Proiect Revision
28.       Other problems surfaced during the early phases of project
implementation. The more important of these were:
(a) The cost overrun. By mid 1982, it became obvious that there was
a major cost-overrun problem (see para. on project costs). The
overrun on the dam and primary and secondary works was not major
and arose mainly from the long delay before project
effectiveness. The major overrun was on the tertiary network and
on-farm development, and resulted from:
(i)  abandonment of the force-account approach, which in any case
had been severely under-costed during appraisal;
(ii) substantial increases in quantities, which had been
estimated on the basis of insufficiently detailed
topographic work and preliminary designs;
(iii) price increases well above appraisal estimates; and
(iv) inclusion of facilities, machinery and staff not originally
foreseen.



All the co-financiers, as well as the Government, ruled out
any supplementary financing to meet the increased costs.
There was thus no alternative except to re-design the
Project, essentially by reducing the area to be equipped to
2,000 ha.
(b) the redesign of the settlement and on-farm development program.
The settlement and on-farm development proposals were re-designed
in order to permit beneficiary participation in land development,
and to reduce costs. The reformulation of the Project involved a
significant reduction in the area to be irrigated (see maps) and
major revisions in the plans for construction of tertiary
networks and on-farm works; settlement program; and agricultural
development. The revised Project included (i) a concrete
arch-dam to store about 500 MCM of water; (ii) primary, secondary
and tertiary irrigation and drainage networks and roads to serve
a net area of about 2,000 ha (reduced from 3,600 ha proposed
originally); (iii) settlement of 4,100 families vs. 4,400 at
appraisal; and (iv) agricultural development in which all farming
operations were to be entirely the responsibility of the
beneficiaries; (v) the acquisition of rice hullers instead of a
rice mill; and (vi) technical assistance.
The Proaramme of Execution
29.       Preliminary cost breakdowns revealed that substantial overruns
were likely to occur under the different work headings. The reappraisal
study identified the nature of these overruns and evaluated the sums
involved. Table 1 in the annex shows the two appraisals.
30.       It was therefore decided to scale down the Project, particularly
with regard to the canal network.
31.       Concerning the tertiary canals, the original plan had been to
have the work done on force account by SONADER, given the experience
SONADER was acquiring in developing the Bogue perimeter, another
large-scale irrigation area. However, the base studies proved too
inaccurate with respect to topographical detail (with maps at 1:5.000
scale) to permit the work to commence. SONADER, therefore, contracted out
a further topographical study involving aerial photo coverage and mapping
at a scale of 1:2.000.
32.       Work on the dam was delayed by a cement shortage resulting from a
transport quota dispute between Mauritania and Senegal.  The contractor
suffered a loss for which it demanded compensation.  In order to resolve
the disagreement between the two parties (the contractor and SONADER), IDA
suggested that the Mauritanian Government appeal to an international
mediator.  Based on the report of a designated expert, an out-of-court
settlement was reached between the Government and the contractor, whose
loss was evaluated at FF 68 million.



33.       Concerning final on-farm developments, the donors decided (May
1983, Paris) to implement only a first tranche of 600 ha so as to test out
the proposed agricultural development program and assess farmer interest in
the Project. International tenders issued in July 1983 produced only one
bid. Negotiations with the contractor concerned were finalized at UM 170.6
million, t4king into account the work that could be done by farmers.
Though not originally planned, supervision of the work was entrusted by
extension of the contract to the consultant engineer responsible for
supervising the work on the main and secondary canals.
34.       The main delays appear to have occurred on the seconidary works
(two years) and, to an even greater extent, the tertiary works (nearly four
years). This is essentially due to a lack of detail in the basic studies,
which had two major impacts on the Project. First, it was impossible to
carry out the work without complementary studies. Secondly, and more
important, project costs were heavily underestimated and hence the credit
negotiation process was based on incorrect figures.
Proiect Costs
35.       Table 3 gives actual project costs up to December 31, 1986 as
against appraisal estimates. The original cost estimate for the whole area
(3,600 ha) to be developed during 1980-86 was UM 4,197 million (in 1980
prices). The actual cost during 1981-86 for constructing the dam and
headworks and developing an area of only 600 ha (one sixth as big) was,
however, around UH 4,000 million (in current prices).  Expressed in 1987
prices, these costs were about UM 5,200 million.  With the remaining areas
under the second phase of the Project (1987/89 - 1,400 ha and 1989/93 -
1,600 ha), the total cost is estimated at about UH 8,000 million (US$ 110
million) at the 1987 rate of exchange).  Costs per hectare would thus be
about US$ 30,000, of which about US$ 22,000 for the irrigation
infrastructure, almost half of it for the dam and headreach and main
canals.
Performance of Project Components
36.       The performance of individual project components varied according
to changes in project scale and content. The current level of progress is
as follows:
-    The dam has been completed in accordance with the initial
specifications and final acceptance has taken place.
-    The main canal network has been built in accordance with the



- 10 -
revised project objectives. Its characteristics are as
follows:
Canal    Area   Conveyance    Scheduled    Length Built   Head Discharge
Covered     Canal         Length
(ha)      (km)           (km)          (km)           (m3/s)
P1      1.145        1.9         10.4           9.0              3.1
P2      2.746        3.1         18.0          12.0              7.3
* The P1 canal crosses the Gorgol via a 60 m span, 5 girder canal bridge.
-    The secondary canal network was only partially completed.
Of the planned 36 canals, only three were completed built,
19 were simply banked and 13 were not even begun. In linear
terms, this means 9 km completed, 60 km begun and 20.5 not
begun.
-    The tertiary canal network, land development and terminal
on-farm developments covered an area of only 600 ha,
corresponding to sectors S9, S10 and S2 (see maps). Work on
the remaining 1,400 ha of Phase I of the Gorgol Noir Project
is underway and is scheduled to end by mid-1989.
-    The external drainage network channelling the run-off from
surrounding watersheds was completed for almost the entire
perimeter (15 out of 18.5 km). This network is needed to
protect the main canals and the internal land development.
Some of the cross-drainage works originally planned as
siphons were changed to aqueducts or box culverts.
-    The secondary drainage work was completed throughout the
entire Phase I area of 2,000 ha, i.e. 70 km. The 35.5 km of
Phase II remain. The tertiary drainage network, however,
has been built only on the 600 ha that are developed.
-    The main road network was fully built all along the existing
main canals (40 km).  The secondary road network, however,
covers only the section developed for irrigation (7 km out
of 149 km).
-    Settlement and agricultural development were delayed by slow
delivery of irrigation facilities, and the decision by
donors to assess the agricultural development on the first
tranche of 600 ha before continuing with further downstream
development. However, by the second season of irrigated
rice cultivation, over 550 ha (discounting the first pilot
or demonstration season in 1984 in which 46 ha were
cultivated) wet season rice yielded an average of 4.6 t/ha,
which was slightly above appraisal expectations.

Disbursements and Financial Sources
37.       The Project was financed by nine external financiers and the
Government. Cost overruns and the redesign of the project necessitated
changes in financing. After Libya's default in 1984 (for UM 280 million)
other donors had to increase their shares. As of end 1986, the project
cost was still within the sum fixed initially, but its scope was
substantially reduced:

38.       Details of the financing plan by donor and sub-component at time
of appraisal and the last quarter of 1986, respectively, are given in
Tables 4 and 5.  Table 6 compares the phasing of the disbursements as
estimated at appraisal and in practice. As might be expected, the delays
in credit effectiveness and implementation of the Project and changes in
its components caused disbursements to start late and to deviate from the
anticipated pattern.
39.       Delays in disbursement seriously threatened the start-up of the
Project. Subsequent delays were caused by difficulties in implementation
and with Project revisions, rather than by delays in disbursements,
although some minor hold-ups were caused by Government's failure to make
deposits in the Project Operating Account. The default of the Libyan
Government and the refusal of IDB to finance local costs despite its
earlier commitment were, as described before, major causes of delay in the
project's execution.

IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
40.       Establishment of the Project Directorate at Foum Gleita was one
of the conditions of granting the credit.
The SONADER GPD
41.       The Gorgol Projec.t Directorate (GDP) under SONADER is an
independently managed and financially autonomous body. It was set up to
monitor project implementation and operations (for organizational aspects,
see section on agricultural development).
Supervision of Works
42.       For project execution, the GPO set up a work team, led by a
Mauritanian civil engineer and including two supervising engineers and a
topographical brigade. It is clear from the size and diversity of the
works already carried out, that the current team has acquired good
on-the-job training. In all probability, given the experience of the last
tranche of Phase I (development of 1,400 ha), the Mauritanian counterparts
will be able to assume full responsibility for most of the supervisory
aspects of future work.
Water Management
43.       The Project has not achieved its objectives of water control and
rational water management, the main reason being that the perimeter is
still not fully developed and water resources therefore have not been a
management constraint. Since the supply of water in the reservoir (300
million m3) greatly exceeds the needs of the 600 irrigated ha, the tendency
in distribution has been to waste water. Although project management tried
to rationalize distribution, this wasteful trend imposed itself due to the
difficulty of regulating flow in the network and enforcing irrigation
timetables. Some improvements did follow after two years of uneven
efforts.
44.       Water management is currently organized in accordance with user
demands and not according to crop water requirements.   Since the project
designers opted for upstream water control, any water not used by farmers
goes into the drainage network 2nd is lost to the perimeter. The analysis
of mean monthly discharges at canal level for 1986 clearly shows discharge
to be mismatched with seasonal crop requirements. The monthly volume
hovers around a near-constant figure of 5 million m3/month. The average
per hectare volume delivered during the 1986 season is 63,430 m3, i.e.,
more than twice the average crop requirement. Farmers cannot be blamed for
this, considering their complete unfamiliarity with irrigated agriculture
at the time they joined the perimeter. SONADER staff in charge of this
water management are too few in number, insufficiently trained for this
kind of activity, and virtually overwhelmed by the plethora of minor
defects in the calibration of the irrigation works.



- 13 -
45.       Attempts had been made to reduce the nighttime canal flows by
half to save water, but nothing came of it due to the number of sluice-gate
manipulations involved and the canal side degradation produced by extreme
variations in canal water levels. Farmers will have to be taught to
irrigate during at least part of the night so as to adjust flow volumes
closer to crop water requirements.
Maintenance
46.       Despite the relative newness of the irrigation infrastructure.
major maintenance problems arose as soon as it became operational. This
cannot be blamed on the quality of the work done by the contractor.
Despite its poor working conditions, this firm did a good professional job
(particularly in the case of an earth-made network). The maintenance
problems arose in some cases from the restrictive design standards (such as
the canal side slopes) and in others from insufficiently detailed norms
(such as the cross-drainage box culverts).
47.       The organization of maintenance differs depending on the works
involved:
(a) At dam level, maintenance consists of checking the
functioning of the installed electromechanical or hydraulic
equipment. Dam stability is monitored by systematic
readings of gauges set up on the main structure of the dam.
The consultant engineer responsible for engineering
supervision was recently assigned to interpret the first set
of readings;
*b) At the level of the headreach and primary canals, the
maintenance service is in the process of providing full
protection for the inner and outer sides of the canals. The
inner sides cave in and deteriorate through wave action,
water wakes and the hooves of animals drinking from the
canals. Protection is novel, and consists of sinking schist
slabs into shores hit by wave action, particularly in areas
where streamflow velocity is high, such as on curves. The
external sides and ridge are degraded by rainwater run-off,
which causes deep gullying. Protection in this case
consists of filling in the gullies with wet earth and
covering the ridge and sides with crushed, tamped-down
schist rock.
(c) Scouring occurs at the iuncture of the earthworks with the
concrete-covered areas, usually because the dissipation
basin is not big enough and because these areas are used by
people for washing or drawing water.  Prote tion consists of
extending the cement lining with gabions. 1I
(d) A series of operations need to be carried out systematically
on the perimeter after the rainy season:
1/ The Saudi Fund for Development adds that "erosion of canal bank by rainwater
run-off and wind can be prevented by seeding of short growing variety of grass
in the unwetted part of the canal. Erosion by drinking animals can be prevented
by construction of special places for animal watering and taking stern actions
against people watering their animals at places other than those especially
conRtrulted plae.es."

Weeding and cleaning out the main canals, particularly
in sections where water velocity is very low;
Cleaning out the cross-drainage works (culverts);
Reinforcament of external canal sides and internal
drain sides;
Cleaning out secondary drains and sometimes specific
tertiary drains; and
Regrading roads.
Extension Services
48.       The extension services have been remarkably effective in training
settlers with little prior knowledge of farming, or of modern techniques of
rice cultivation over two or three crop seasons. The ratio of extension
workers to farmers has been high (1 per 96 farmers at present). Despite
this satisfactory performance, extension workers still lack basic training.
The good results were obtained only through the high level of motivation of
the extension officers in charge and through the communication of technical
recommendations in small, easily remembered instalments under the "Training
and Visit' system.
Technical Assistance
49.       Technical assistance envisaged at appraisal included 113 man-
months for supervision of construction and 546 man-months for implementing
the Project. Some adjustments were made in view of revisions of project
plans, e.g., shortening of the contract of the Technical Director avd
increasing consultancy services to cover supervision of tertiary networks
formerly expected to be done by force account.
50.       Performance of technical assistance personnel has ranged from
excellent to mediocre depending on the individual, but on the whole the
jobs got done. However, as might be expected from the number of
expatriates involved, some resistance to further inputs of technical
assistance has arisen from GDP and SONADER staff generally. This technical
assistance "fatigue* would need to be taken into account in future project
preparation exercises involving SONADER.
Procurement
51.       SONADER's past experience with several projects has led to the
establishment of effective procurement procedures; no major difficulties
were encountered.



-15-
Training
52.       No specific provision was made for training under this Project,
but well designed on-the-job training was provided for extension agents,
irrigators and farmers.
|            Accounting and Reporting
53.       The GPD has maintained project accounts satisfactorily as
required under the DCA. Reporting on physical and financial progress also
appears to be adequate.
Agricultural Inputs. Credit and Marketing
54.       Agricultural inputs were distributed free of charge during the
first major cultivation season (1985 wet season). It was only in 1986,
however, that inputs (mainly fertilizer and seed) were given at full cost,
but on interest-free credit. The credit was recovered in kind and, by the
end of 1986, the rate of recovery stood at 76.7Z. All inputs and credit
were provided to farmers by the GPD.
55.       Fertilizers were purchased from private dealers who delivered
*          them to the project site, but often with considerable delays.  The
situation was saved only by the fact that actual demand had been
overestimated in 1985 and left-over stocks could thus be utilized in 1986
*          when deliveries were delayed.  The same events were repeated in 1987.
56.       Although treated seeds of good quality were available from the
government seed farm at Kaddi, farmers tended to revert to seed from local
sources or to use their own seed.
57.       Market outlets for surplus cereals (mainly rice) have been less
than satisfactory. Although the Commissariat de securite alimentaire (CSA)
theoretically buys the grain at an attractive guaranteed price, it is not
usually on the scene when the farmers want to sell (generally soon after
harvest) and farmers are compelled to sell at much lower prices (e.g., UM
10 to 12 per kg for rice vs UM 18.5 kg paid by CSA). Nor has Lhe CSA
adequate financial resources to buy in sufficient quantities to have a
significant impact on prices offered by the private trade. On average, CSA
has purchased 30-40X of the paddy produced in the project area.



- 16 -
Prices
58.       Prices of both agricultural products and inputs were considerably
higher in 1987 than at the time of appraisal. The farmgate price for paddy
is UM 18.5 per kg compared to UM 10 at appraisal, a 12Z annual increase.
This was mainly due to Government's increasing the guaranteed prices of
cereals and removing subsidies on fertilizers. The economic prices of
cereals have, however, dropped slightly in comparison with those in the
SAR, and economic prices of inputs have gone up (Table 7). The economic
price of paddy is UM 11 per kg compared to UM 16.6 at appraisal, an annt.-l
decrease of 82.
Farmers' Settlement and Organizations
59.       About 1,100 farmer families, or about 4,100 people, have been
settled so far (on the 600 ha) in the project area. The establishment and
development of farmers' organizations was not among the original project
proposals contained in the SAR. However, on the GPD's own initiative, ten
voluntarv farmers' organizations, or Groupements precooperatifs (GPCs),
each comprising 50 to 100 members, were set up, thus covering about
two-thirds of the families settled so far.
60.       In fact, the most obvious way for SONADER and GPD to disengage
themselves from activities such as input distribution and maintenance of
tertiary canals and drains and to involve the beneficiaries in the
construction of social infrastructure is to promote the take-over of these
functions by GPCs. Considerable progress has been made in this direction.
61.       Overall, the farmers' settlement program has been implemented
satisfactorily. However, one of the drawbacks encountered is that people
from the same village and ethnic group have not been settled in common
irrigation turn-outs, whereas GPCs have been formed along village and
ethnic lines. Thus, GPCs often cut across irrigation areas and this makes
it difficult to organize canal and drain maintenance operations through
them.
Covenants
62.       In general, the covenants contained in the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) and Project Agreement (PA), have been complied with by the
Borrower. Some revisions in the legal covenants of the DCA and PA were
proposed at the co-financiers meeting in Paris in 1983 and the legal
documents were amended accordingly. A few temporary problems in Borrower
compliance that occurred were:
-    failure to deposit the required sums of money into the project
operating account in a timely manner (PA Section 4.01 b); in some
instances SONADER's Head Office retained the funds without
passing them on to the GPD;



- 17 -
-    delays in furnishing financial statements of project accounts and
auditors' reports (PA Section 4.03 a, ii).
However, these lapses did not cause any important delays in the actual
implementation of the Project.
V. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
A. Impact on Agricultural Production
Yields
63.       Table 8 compares annual yields projected in the SAR with those
actually obtained. In the case of rice, the yields obtained in 1986
(admittedly over a limited area) already exceed appraisal predictions
marginally in the wet season (4.7 t/ha actual vs 4.5 tlha predicted), but
fall short in the dry season (2.8 t/ha actual vs 4.5 t/ha predicted).
Yields of maize and sorghum have been highly variable on the small areas
planted and are nowhere near appraisal expectations.
64.       Although the average yields of paddy are very satisfactory,
examination of yields obtained by individual farmers shows R sizeable
proportion of them getting very low yields on the order of 1-2 tons/ha,
indicating that there is potential for further improvement.
65.       Areas and Cropping intensities. Areas cropped are also below
appraisal estimates, mainly due to delays in project implementation. Even
the revised targets have not been met as shown by the following tablet

a/ Includes areas originally meant to be cultivated by the Project
Authority.
Note:       DS = Dry Season            WS = Wet Season
Most of the farmers cultivated rice. Sorghum and maize were grown on small
areas, and vegetables, expected to contribute significantly to farm
incomes, were not grown at all. This is mainly due to the absence of
demand for vegetables in the project area and may also be due to the almost



- 18 -
exclusive concentration of the extension services on rice. Cultivation
intensities rose from 1.1 in 1985, the first full year of cultivation, to
1.6 in 1986.
Crop Production
66.       Table 9 shows crop production levels envisaged at appraisal and
actually achieved up to the end of 1986. Production of paddy in 1986 was
222 of appraisal estimates. Once again, in the case of rice at least, this
reflects mainly the delayed delivery of irrigated land to farmers. Paddy
production actually rose from 130 tons in 1984 (over 46 ha) to 1,600 tons
in 1985 and 3,150 tons in 1986. On a pro-rata basis, the production in
1986 represents, for 550 ha, more or less the rice production level at full
development envisaged in the original appraisal estimate.
67.       As would be expected from the small areas cultivated with maize
and sorghum and the mediocre results obtained, the production of these
crops is well below appraisal projections.
Use of Farm Inputs
70.       Since no records have been maintained on the use of farm inputs
in the project area, an accurate assessment cannot be made. In the first
year of cultivation fertilizer was giver. free of charge, while in the
second year it was given on interest-free credit although it was agreed
during negotiations that a 122 interest rate would be charged. The
recovery was combined with the recovery of water charges. It is not clear
whether the general resentment shown by farmers to the recovery applied
only to water charges or whether they had also assumed that the fertilizer
was free once again.
Farm Level Impact
71.       Table 10 shows representative summary farm budgets for the
cultivation year 1986. When compared with appraisal projections (SAR,
Annex 2, Table 6), farmers, especially rice farmers, appear to be already
doing much better than was expected in terms of the net value of
production. The main reason for this appears to be the considerably higher
farm-gate cereal prices in 1986 as compared with those that prevailed at
the time of appraisal. Since 1986 was only the second full year of
cultivation, even better results could be expected at full development when
farmers have improved their skills further and yields have correspondingly
increased.
Cost Recovery
72.       It was envisaged at appraisal that Project O&M costs would be
recovered by the imposition of water charges on farmers. The raising of
water charges to include the recovery of capital costs was thought to be
Inadvisable, given the already high rent recovery index. Accordingly, at



- 19 -
negotiations it was agreed that SONADER would collect water charges
amounting to UM12,000/halyear.
73.       No water charges were in fact collected during the first full
year of cultivation on account of the relatively low yields obtained by
farmers. In the second year (1986), water charges were fixed at
UM10,000/ha/year.
B. Economic Re-evaluation
74.       This economic re-evaluation has been undertaken, with appropriate
projections and the analysis has been carried out in 1987 prices, with past
expenditures converted to 1987 prices by using the GDP deflator.
75.       Actual costs during 1981-86 were converted to economic prices by
adjusting the local portion with the standard conversion factor (SCF) of
.867. Actual shares of local costs during 1981-86 were not available and
the values from the SAR were used. Investment costs during 1987-89 for
1,400 ha were estimated from the contract with the construction company.
Projected costs for 1989-93 period for the last 1,600 ha were taken
directly from the FAO/CP. No adjustments were made for taxes and duties
since the Project is exempted from all identifiable fiscal obligations.
Economic prices were estimated for main crops and inputs (Table 7), and a
shadow price derived for labor of UM34.2/day.
76.       Delays in project implementation influenced the flow of benefits
which are substanLially behind schedule. In 1986, season and off-season
paddy was cropped on only 792 ha (21% of original projections) and
sorghum/maize on only 25 ha (62 of original projections).
77.       Financial prices of crops and inputs have increased between
appraisal time and the present (Table 7). Economic prices of crops,
however, have been reduced by about one-third for rice and by about 20Z for
maize. These movements and the lag in benefits flow have reduced project
profitability.
78.       In addition to the benefits, benefits from fishing and flood
recession crop production were also taken into account. It was assumed that
because of the Project, incremental production of sorghum and millet have
developed around the dam reservoir. The lake has created conditions for
flood-recession production.
79.       Economic analysis on the above assumptions shows (Table 11) that
the estimated ERR is 2.7Z as compared with the appraisal estimate of 7.4Z.

VI. BANK PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
80.       Although delays in implementation have plagued the project,
Government's major objectives in launching the Project viz. (i) to reduce
the country's dependence on food aid, and (ii) to provide a steady income
to farmers to meet their basic needs are well on the way to achievement.
As the first major irrigation scheme in Mauritania, certain intrinsic risks
were foreseen by the Bank and efforts made to reduce them. Thus, through a
long and arduous process of preparation, numerous adjustments were made to
arrive at the technical solution finally chosen, and an implementing
institution (SONADER) was built up.
81.       The risks that appeared most prominent at appraisal were:
- The high cost of, and lack of experience with, the execution of major
works by force account andlor through contracts in Mauritania; these
were counteracted by pre-selecting bidders, obtaining firm contract
prices, allowing a margin for uncertainty in bid proposals and having
strong technical supervision; and
- Possible shortfalls in projected yields resulting from the difficulty
of converting semi-nomadic rainfed farmers to settled, irrigation
farmers practicing double cropping.
82.       In fact, the major problems that hampered the execution of the
Project as planned were (a) different interpretations of the legal
documents by other donors and by the Government, (b) the use of
inadequately detailed, preliminary data in preparing the designs for the
tertiary systems resulting in high cost overruns and long delays from the
additional time required to generate more detailed basic data, and (c) the
difficulties of coordinating disbursements among ten different financing
sources (one of whom pulled out).
83.       Although, in retrospect, the Bank has to take some of the
responsibility for items (a) and (b) above, a striking feature of project
implementation were the strong coordination and rapport between the Bank
and the executing agency which led to effective solutions being worked out
as problems arose in the course of execution.
84.       The Bank did an excellent job in identifying implementation
problems at an early stage and taking resolute action to revise project
targets to more realistic levels and to re-design the settlement and
agricultural development components. The Bank was also able to coordinate
the activities of the donors effectively and arrive, after some initial
difficulties, at a satisfactory disbursement rate.
Supervision



- 21 -
85.       The Bank supervised the Project adequately, fielding nine
supervision missions. However there were long intervals without
supervision missions (1982, 1985-86), although supplementary missions were
active during one of these periods. Mission composition was technically
strong and good staff continuity was maintained (see Basic Data Sheet).
86.       Corrective action was taken to revise the Project before matters
came to a head, although no attempt seems to have been made to assess the
impact of the revisions on the economic rate of return of the Project.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
87.       It is too early to make final judgments on the successes and
failures of the Project as a whole. First, although the Bank's share of
the loan has been disbursed, project investments are still continuing from
funds provided by the other donors. Secondly, the relegation of part of
the original project objectives to a second phase (presently being
prepared) in which first phase investments are regarded as sunk cost, and
thirdly, the yet incomplete state of the first phase, make it difficult to
do more than make a provisional economic re-evaluation of the Project.
88.       Nevertheless, despite an apparent shortfall in the ultimate
Project ERR in comparison to original appraisal expectations, the major
objectives of reducing the country's dependence on food imports and
ensuring an adequate income to settler-farmers are certainly likely to be
achieved. Furthermore, much valuable experience was gained in implementing
what is really the first major irrigation project in Mauritania, with
probable benefit to future projects to he taken up for implementation under
the plan for the development of the Senegal River Valley. As discussed
exhaustively in the course of pre-appraisal, Mauritania lacks investment
opportunities, especially in the Southern Region in which the Project is
sited, and the low economic rate of return has to be viewed in this light.
89.       The lessons to be learned from the Project are as follows:
-    It is absolutely essential for irrigation projects in Mauritania
to have final designs, based on accurate base data, on which
project costs could be estimated and construction scheduled
before pre-appraisal;
-    A large number of donor agencies is best avoided, but if
unavoidable, firm commitments and financing schedules for each
donor should be agreed to before final negotiations. Dependence
on unreliable or marginal donors for financing key components of
the Project should also be avoided. A project coordination unit
specifically charged with monitoring disbursements should bring
problems encountered to the notice of the relevant donors without
delay and call a meeting of donors, if necessary;
- The project would have benefitted from greater legal input, both



- 22 -
in design and supervision;
- Irrigation projects in Mauritania should be monitored regularly
with appropriate modifications made as needed by a strong Bank
supervision team, as was the case in the Gorgol Irrigation
Project.
