I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01     Turkey has substantial untapped lignite and hydropower resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
low-temperature geothermal potential.
1.02     Hydropower.  Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW under average hydrological conditions and
corresponds to an annual production of about 100,000 GWh. Only 10% has been
developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30% over the next 10
years with the completion of hydropower generating plants under construction
or planned. Detailed information is available on almost half of the potential
(13,400 MW and 40,600 GWh), including feasibility studies on four large sites
contributing some 6,500 MW (23,300 GWh). One issue which may hamper the
development of the hydropower potential relates to the future of the riparian
agreements between Turkey and its neighbors, particularly Iraq and Syria.
There is also a large number of sites suitable for small and mini hydropower
schemes of up to 20 MW. Studies are now underway to determine the potential
for small hydropower schemes according to the Government's classification:
micro (50 kW-l MW), mini (1-5 MW) and small (5-20 MW).  There are presently
about 150 existing micro hydro plants in operation. No estimates of the small
and mini hydro potential are available.
1.03     Oil and Gas.  Proven recoverable reserves of oil are about 16 million
tons.  However, potential reserves that may become economically recoverable
using enhanced oil recovery techniques currently being tested could be as high
as 30 million tons. Oil production has been declining over the last decade,
as few discoveries have been made in recent years; in 1980 production was
about 2.3 million tons, equivalent to 15% of total consumption. Proven
recoverable gas reserves are about 450 billion standard cubic feet, equivalent
to 10 million tons of oil. This gas is expected to be brought to major
consumers by 1985. Production in 1980 was insignificant.
1.04     Coal, Lignite and Shale.  Total known reserves of hard coal are
estimated at about 1 billion tons, all located in the north of Turkey
(Zonguldak). Coal production has been declining as operations move to deeper,
less accessible seams; in 1980 production was 3.6 million tons (2.4 million
toe). Proven and probable lignite reserves are about 7.5 billion tons, but
about half of this is of extremely low quality (950-1,000 kcal/kg). Lignite
production in 1980 was about 15 million tons, equivalent to about 3 million
tons of oil. Proven reserves of economically recoverable and usable
asphaltite and shale are insignificant. Asphaltite proven reserves are only 5
million tons. While the possible geological reserves of shale are quite large
(5 billion tons), mineable reserves are less than 300 million tons.
Furthermore, the low and variable quality of the shale makes it unlikely that
this resource can be economically exploited.



- 2 -
1.05      Geothermal.  There is some potential for geothermal development,
especially for space heating. No long-term development program has been
organized to exploit it. However, a foreign company with extensive experience
in geothermal power has recently undertaken a technical review of a number of
promising geothermal sites, and discussions with the Government on possible
terms and conditions for developing one of these sites are currently in
progress.
Energy Consumption
1.U6      Total gross energy consumption was about 33 million toe in 1980, of
which commercial energy consumption amounted to 26 million toe. Petroleum
made up the most significant share of primary commercial energy (60%) with
lignite (18%), hydropower (11%), coal (10%) and imported electricity (1%)
composing the remainder. Overall, 23% of final commercial energy consumption
was in the form of electricity (see Annex 1.1). Non-commercial energy
production (primarily fuelwood, but also other biomass) was an important
energy source, accounting for 37% of total domestic energy production. While
it represented less than one quarter of the energy consumed in the economy as
a whole, it was the major energy source for the household sector, accounting
for almost 60% of this sector's total consumption.
1.07      The most notable change in the pattern of energy consumption over the
past two decades has been the decrease in the relative share of hard coal in
total energy. This was accompanied by a rapid growth in consumption of
petroleum until the mid-1970s, peaking at over 50% in 1977/78; and a rapid
rise in the share of lignite (primarily for thermal power production) and
hydroelectric power consumption starting in the second half of the 1970s.
During this period, hard coal consumption stayed relatively constant in
absolute terms, while traditional biomass energy sources increased slightly in
absolute terms, but decreased steadily as a percentage of total energy
consumed.
1.08      Per capita energy consumption is likely to rise rapidly in parallel
with rising per capita income. Trends observed in the growth and pattern of
energy consumption during the latter part of the 1970's are expected to
continue during the 1980's. Demand for electricity would grow rapidly,
primarily as a function of the growth of the industrial sector. The demand
for lignite would also grow rapidly, both for direct consumption by households
and industry and, even more importantly, by the power sector. The growth in
the demand for petroleum would be moderate due to the much higher price of
imported oil and petroleum products and its substitution by other energy
sources. The most important factor in the growth of energy demand will be the
growth rate of the economy as a whole and the growth of the relatively
energy-intensive industrial sector of the economy. Bank estimates indicate
that the growth rate of the economy would average about 5% per year during the
1980's and that the industrial sector would grow slightly faster, Under these
projections, electricity demand is expected to grow by 200% between 1980 and
1990, to about 60,000 GWh; lignite demand for industries and households would
grow by 160% to 27 million tons; lignite demand by thermal power plants would
grow by almost tenfold to about 50 million tons; fuelwood and biomass demand
would grow by 14% to 36 million tons; and petroleum demand would grow by 110%
to 30 million tons. However, actual consumption may be lower due to supply
constraints.



-3-
Energy Supply
1.09     To meet its energy requirements Turkey launched a massive program in
the late 1970's to increase the domestic production of electricity and
lignite. This program has tended to stretch the implementation capabilities
of the State energy agencies, and spread resources too thinly over too many
projects, with resulting long delays in completion schedules.
1.10     Almost all of the planned new thermal plants will be lignite-fired.
This places a heavy burden on the Government-owned Turkish Coal Enterprise
(TKI) to expand its lignite production facilities, and TKI has embarked upon
an extremely ambitious program to meet this growing demand for lignite. From
the 15 million tons produced in 1980, production is planned to rise to 70.7
million tons in 1990, a more than four-fold increase, to be accomplished
through the development of eleven large open pit mines and two large
mechanized underground mines.
Energy Balance
1.11     The energy balance based on the above demand and supply projections
is presented in Annex 1.2. Projections indicate that there would be
shortfalls in lignite production of about 9 million tons in 1985 and 7 million
tons in 1990; shortfalls that would have to be made up with additional fuel
oil imports. Energy import levels needed to balance demand requirements would
amount to about 28 million toe in 1990. A higher level of economic growth
would, of course, lead to substantially higher levels of demand. An increase
of an extra 1% in GDP growth per year until 1990, would, even with a
relatively low elasticity of demand of 1.2, increase total annual energy
consumption by about 5 million toe, all of which would have to come from
imports. The need for such a high level of energy imports would put a severe
strain on the Turkish economy. Furthermore, any slippages in the lignite
investment program would result in even higher levels of energy imports.
Organization of the Energy Sector
1.12     The energy sector in Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
Government owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources in
Turkey. Under MENR, the Turkish Coal Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum
Company (TPAO), and the Mineral Research Institute (MTA) have responsibility
for the extraction of fossil fuels and radioactive minerals. Identification,
design and construction of hydro projects is entrusted to the State Hydraulics
Authority (DSI). The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) is responsible for
the generation, transmission and, since November 1982, the distribution of
almost all the electricity sold in Turkey. TEK is also responsible for the
implementation of the Government's program for rural electrification and the
construction of all generating and transmission facilities, with the exception
of hydroelectric plants for which DSI has responsibility (see Chapter IV).
1.13     Private sector participation in the supply of electricity is confined
to two small private utilities (CEAS and KEPEZ) and industrial companies which
generate power for their own use, often in conjunction with the production of
steam for process heat.

Energy Sector Policies and Planning
1.14     Pricing.  Throughout the 1970's the Government's failure to adjust
domestic energy prices led to increasingly serious economic problems. The low
wellhead prices set for domestic petroleum production became a major deterrent
to exploration and development by international oil companies. At the same
time, the policy of holding domestic petroleum product prices constant in
local currency terms, in spite of accelerating domestic inflation and rising
world prices for energy, led to the rapidly increasing demand for petroleum
and imports. Similarly, prices for hard coal, lignite and to a lesser extent,
electricity, the other major primary energy sources, were also held down,
causing serious financial losses to TKI and marginal profits to TEK, and
discouraging the adoption of effective conservation measures in both
production and consumption (for discussion of electricity pricing, see paras
2.17-2.20). It was not until the financial and political crises of late 1979
and early 1980 that the policy of energy subsidies was largely abandoned and
most prices raised to international levels. It is now the policy of the
Government to allow energy prices to be high enough to provide adequate
returns to the energy State Economic Enterprises (SEE's).
1.15     Conservation.  The Government is also in the process of developing a
program for the conservation of energy by encouraging efficient use in
existing and new industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and
legislation are being evaluated by both the MENR and the State Planning
Organization (SPO), and legislation has already been passed which allows for
tax credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency
improvements. The Government has initiated programs to assist industrial
firms to learn how to improve their energy efficiency in existing operations.
The Bank included technical assistance for energy audits in selected
manufacturing facilities as part of the assistance to the Government of Turkey
under Loan 1916-TU.
1.16     Planning.  The Fourth five-year plan (1979-1983) was prepared during
a period of exceptionally high growth expectations, which proved to be
unachievable in the following years of economic difficulties. The rapidly
changing economic circumstances made it necessary to switch to one-year plans
that had limited relevance to the original five-year plan. These timely one
year plan revisions served quite well during a period of great economic
fluctuations and stress.
1.17     A new five-year plan (the Fifth) is now under preparation for
1984-1988. New energy demand and supply projections are being made, which
will be consistent with the current projections for economic growth for the
period, and supply alternatives are being reviewed to optimize the investment
program. The Bank expects to review this new five-year plan as part of its
continuing economic dialogue with the Government. The joint UNDP-World Bank

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Existing Power Facilities
2.01     Growth in sales averaged 12% per annum during the period 1965-1970,
rose to a maximum of 19% in 1976, and subsequently declined sharply, reaching
only 5% in 1980. In 1981 and 1982, however, sales have increased at an
average annual rate of 8.5% and 7.2% respectively, amounting to 25,905 GWh in
1982. Between 1970 and 1979 the percentage of the population with access to
public electricity supply rose from 51% to 75%. Gross consumption of
electricity per capita rose from 240 kWh in 1970 to 540 kWh in 1980,
representing a per annum increase of approximately 9%. However, the
development of electricity supply has not kept pace with the growth in demand,
resulting in frequent power shortages and increasing reliance on imports.
Generating capacity and electricity production increased at average annual
rates of 9.2X and 9% respectively over the 1972-82 period (Annex 2.1).
2.02     The present total installed capacity is 6,363 MW, of which 3,406 MW
(54%) is thermal and the balance 2,957 MW (46%) hydro. Peak load in 1982 was
5,100 MW. Total gross generation amounted to 26,562 GWh in 1982, of which TEK
accounted for 88% (23,240 GWh), the remainder being generated by
self-producers (1,642 GWh, 6%), CEAS, KEPEZ and municipalities (1,680 GWh,
6%). Generation was below the effective demand, estimated at about 29,400 GWh
for that year. The relatively high level of system losses contributed to the
supply shortages. Overall losses in the system are about 20% including
distribution. However, the shortages would have been even more severe but for
imports from Bulgaria and the USSR, which amounted to almost 1,800 GWh in
1982.
2.03     The share of hydropower in total installed capacity has increased
substantially in the past ten years, from 33% in 1972 to 46% in 1982. This
change in the hydro/thermal plant mix was reflected by an increasing
hydropower contribution to total generation. In 1982, half of the electricity
generated in Turkey was produced by hydropower plants. On the thermal side,
lignite has made an increasing contribution to the production of electricity
and by 1981 was as important as fuel oil, which has shown a more modest
increase over the past five years. The relative share of hard coal has shown
a substantial decline, largely due to a deliberate policy of substitution by
lignite.
System Planning
2.04     TEK has the primary responsibility for formulating the program for
the expansion of the generation, transmission and distribution systems.
Generation expansion is planned with the help of a mathematical model,
developed by TEK with Bank assistance, on the basis of demand forecasts
prepared jointly between TEK, MENR and SPO. Transmission expansion is also
planned with computer aided techniques. Distribution planning, however, is
practically non-existent. Although a planning and coordination department has
existed in TEK for several years, its activities have often been severely
curtailed by the high turnover of trained staff. The major weaknesses in
system planning are:



- 6 -
(a) inadequate analysis of future energy and electricity demand
including collection and analysis of load duration data;
(b) ineffective use of the planning models; while the present
generation models are soundly conceived there are several
shortcomings related to the assumptions and parameters used in
the models, particularly in timing and production constraints
related to new investments;
(c) poor coordination between TEK, MENR, SPO, TKI and DSI; and
(d) lack of trained and experienced planning staff.
2.05     Demand Forecast.  The current medium and long-term forecasts,
prepared in 1981 in connection with the 1982-86 power investment program and
long-term power development plan (1984-2003), are based on the relationship
between electricity consumption and industrial output. They show total energy
demand (GWh) growing at an annual average rate of 10% between 1982 and 1990,
with peak load (MW) increasing at 7.7% per annum. In line with this forecast,
TEK's bulk electricity sales would increase at an annual average rate of 12%,
from 22,782 GWh in 1982 to 57,419 GWh in 1990. However, due to supply
constraints these targets will not be met.
2.06     TEK's demand forecast is justified on the basis of Turkey's
medium-term prospects for economic growth, provided that the recent upward
trend in the country's exports is sustained and that the monetary and fiscal
policy slippages observed in 1982 do not seriously disrupt the economic
stabilization process underway. Bank estimates indicate that, after a short
period of austerity in 1983 and 1984, GDP growth is expected to pick up in
1985 and rise to an average of 6.1% for the 1985-1990 period, as compared with
an average annual rate of growth of about 4.5% between 1972 and 1982.
2.07     However, the forecast of electricity sales in Turkey is unrealistic
as it will be severely constrained by the availability of supply. Generating
capacity is expected to fall short of meeting the forecast sales, and present
operating policies do not allow for a higher level of imports. Therefore, an
alternative sales forecast based on realistic generation projections has been
prepared for appraisal purposes. Under this forecast, TEK's sales would
increase at an annual average rate of 10.5% to reach 50,947 GWh in 1990.
2.08     Planned Generation.  Annex 2.2 gives details of the forecast energy
and capacity balances as appraised by the Bank on the basis of an updated
implementation schedule and likely slippages in the commissioning of some
hydro or thermal power plants. The installed capacity is expected to grow
from 6,363 MW in 1982 to 15,050 MW in 1990, with the share of hydropower in
the total rising from 46% to 53%. Assuming average water flows, the share of
hydropower in total generation, however, would decline over the period, from
54% in 1982 to 42% in 1990. The capacity reserve margin (MW) is expected to
remain at an adequate level of 20% for the next four years (1983-1986) and



7-
rise further towards the end of the period (1983-1990). However, the
projected generation expansion will not be able to meet the system's energy
requirements (GWh), even under average hydrological conditions. The deficit
will have to be met by continued imports of up to 2,000 GWh per annum from
Bulgaria and the USSR. This situation, which would be exacerbated
significantly in dry years, is caused primarily by the low capacity
utilization factor (about 50%) for the majority of existing and future thermal
power plants; and points out the need for TEK to improve energy supply through
better maintenance and rehabilitation of its generating facilities.
Furthermore, the fact that project implementation has been rather poor in the
past has led to protracted delays in the commissioning of generating units and
limited the margin available to compensate for poor operating efficiency.
2.09     Reduction of energy shortages and increased efficiency could also be
attained through conservation measures aiming at restraining future demand and
through improved load management. The attainment of these objectives,
however, is constrained by the present lack of accurate data on the
consumption patterns for the various consumers and the lack of knowledge about
the reaction of the consumers to changes in the prices of electricity and/or
curtailment of their supply of power (para 2.33).
2.10     All new thermal power plants, under construction or proposed, would
use lignite for power generation, with the exception of a 60 MW combined-cycle
diesel-fired unit and a coal-fired plant to replace an old unit at Catalagzi.
Based on the projected expansion of electricity supply, the associated fuel
requirements are expected to rise from 6 million tons of lignite in 1982 to
about 15 million tons in 1985 and 40 million tons in 1990. The potential for
use of gas in power generation would be determined once the size of the
reserves is better known.
2.11     Transmission.  The salient feature of the Turkish power system is
that electricity loads are concentrated in the northwest of the country while
the mLajor hydro and lignite resources are located in the east.  Bulk
transmission distances average 700-800 km. To cope with this situation, TEK's
transmission expansion program includes construction of 4,433 km of 380-kV
lines by 1990. Of these, 2,049 are in operation or under construction and
1,500 km more are planned for 1983-1986 under the proposed Project
(para 3.02 (a)). Ongoing transmission construction includes also
proportionate increases in 380-kV substations and 150-kV and 30-kV lines and
substations.
2.12     Urban Distribution and Village Electrification.  TEK recently took
over responsibility for the urban distribution networks. To date it has taken
over the 67 main cities in Turkey and 239 other municipalities, and expects to
absorb the remaining 1,419 within a period of about two years (see para
4.07). TEK plans to carry out, with the assistance of consultants, a detailed
survey of the urban networks in order to determine their condition and
formulate an appropriate investment program (para 3.13). This would form the
basis for a distribution master plan aimed at the rehabilitation of existing
networks to reduce the present high losses, estimated at about 16%, to a more
acceptable level (e.g. 7%-10%), and improving the quality of service, together
with a plan for the expansion of the networks.



-8-
2.13     A feature of TEK's supply program to the rural sector has been the
ambitious plan to electrify all of Turkey's villages, totalling about 36,000.
By the end of 1982, about 60% of the villages had been connected to the
national system, and the target was to electrify the balance by the end of
1987. However, there have been increasing delays in adhering to TEK's
original schedule because of the tendency to start too many new projects each
year with the resources available.
Investment Program
2.14     The appraisal mission assumed a realistic subsector investment
program taking likely project completion dates into account. In addition,
plausible assumptions were made regarding the requirements for the components
of the program other than ganeration. Details of the investment program for
1983-1987 as assumed by the Bank are given in Annex 2.3. It should not be
considered as a definitive program for adoption, but rather as the basis for
discussion with the Turkish authorities to assist them in formulating such a
program and improving their investment planning.
2.15     The coordination of the investment programs of TEK, DSI and TKI,
remains a problem but the establishment, in response to a covenant under the
Karakaya Loan Agreement (Loan 1844-TU), of a coordinator reporting to the
Under Secretary of the Ministry of Energy is a step in the right direction.
It is important that coordination, especially between TEK and TKI, be improved
and monitored on a regular basis, so that potential bottlenecks can be
identified at an early stage and actions taken to eliminate them. Serious
problems appear to be looming in relation to several thermal power projects,
since the lignite mines required to supply the fuel for these stations have
been delayed for technical as well as financial reasons.
Electricity tariffs
2.16     Prices for electricity supplied by TEK to its customers are set by
TEK, subject to Government approval. TEK's present tariff schedule for sales
at over 1,000 volts (bulk supply) provides the consumer with a choice between
two pricing structures: (a) a two-part tariff, comprising a capacity charge
per kW of contracted load plus an energy charge; or (b) a one-part tariff.
Major industrial consumers, such as the aluminum and ferrochrome industries
enjoy preferential rates. Low-voltage consumers, e.g. electrified villages,
pay a single-term tariff rate. The tariff is uniform throughout the year and
has no provision for time-of-day pricing differentials.
2.17     Changes in the tariff structure were recommended to TEK in a study
carried out in 1975 by the Middle East Technical University, in accordance
with a requirement under the Bank's TEK Transmission II project (Loan
1194-TU). However, the recommendations were not implemented and TEK has, at
present, no plans to restructure its tariffs along the lines recommended in
the study (para 2.33).



2.18     TEK has experienced difficulty and delay in the past in securing
Government approval for proposed tariff increases beyond dire-ct fuel cost
adjustments, even in the face of rising investment needs. High voltage
tariffs increased in real terms during 1980 and 1981 (by about 40 and 60%
respectively), and just kept pace with general inflation as measured by the
wholesale price index in 1982. 1/ However, tariffs remain significantly below
the long-run marginal cost of supply, estimated at about US$0.075/kWh (bulk
supply), compared with an existing average tariff of US$0.040/kWh for bulk
supply (i.e., 53Z) 2/; and do not yield sufficient revenue to contribute
adequately to the future investment program (para 5.15).
2.19     Retail tariffs in the municipalities have been subject to the
approval of MENR and the Ministry of Finance, and this procedure is likely to
continue, even though TEK has taken over the responsibility of municipal
distribution. Retail tariffs have the same basic structure as the bulk supply
tariff, but vary according to end-use consumption. Customers have a choice
between a two-part tariff and a single tariff, except for small industry which
cannot contract for the two-part tariff. The tariff levels are uniform
throughout the country even though operating and capital expenditures differ
widely across regions. Present tariff levels are too low to finance a
significant share of investments for distribution rehabilitation and
extension, although inadequate investment historically has also been due to
cross-subsidization of other municipal services. Retail tariffs have, in
addition, failed to keep pace with inflation because of Government control.
Bank's Role in the Power Subsector
2.20     The proposed Project would be the fifteenth Bank operation in the
power subsector in Turkey. The Bank has made ten loans and a technical
assistance grant (total US$476.7 million), and IDA has granted three credits
(total US$55.7 million). These comprise loans/credits for four hydroelectric
projects; two thermal power stations (oil- and lignite-fired); a lignite mine;
and several transmission and distribution networks. The technical assistance
grant helped reorganize Turkey's power subsector. The first five
loans/credits were for projects in the CEAS concession area. All these
projects were completed successfully, although often with long delays. The
Bank has made three previous loans to TEK, for the First and Second Power
Transmission Projects, and for the Elbistan Mine and Power Project. A
supplementary loan, which is expected to be presented to the Board in FY84,
will address the problems of cost overruns for the Elbistan lignite mine and
power plant project.

TEK Power Transmission (Loan 763-TU) projects found that these projects had
met their physical objectives despite implementation delays and cost
overruns. A Project Completion Report on the Istanbul Power Distribution
Project (Loan 892-TU), distributed to the Board in December 1982, also
reported physical completion of the Project after considerable delay. Major
constraints to timely project completion were identified as shortage of local
counterpart finance and in the case of Loan 892-TU, late preparation of
bidding documents.  Both reports indicated that the Projects had been only
partially successful in addressing sectoral and institutional problems such as
financial and managerial autonomy, staffing and pricing. The completion
report for TEK Transmission II is due to be submitted in the fall of 1983.
2.22      The Bank played a major role in the consolidation of the power sector
and in the creation of TEK. The Bank has since then continued to advocate
much needed institutional reform but has met with limited success in its
endeavors to assist in strengthening the institutional capabilities of the
subsector. Progress has, however, been made in some areas, e.g., improvements
in TEK's accounting system, in system planning, and in procurement
procedures. Furthermore, the Bank has assisted in attracting funds from other
bilateral and international financing agencies (EIB, German Aid (KfW), US
EXIMBANK).
Power Subsector Report
2.23      The Bank has, more recently, stepped up its sector work program in
the electricity subsector. A draft subsector report 1/ has been reviewed
carefully by the MENR and TEK, agreement reached on its content, and the Bank
will prepare the report in Grey Cover in FY84. This report identified several
important issues facing the power subsector:   institutional weaknesses, poor
coordination and investment; inadequate planning procedures; and tariffs not
reflecting long-run marginal costs. The report recommended that Government
policy be urgently redirected towards achieving two interdependent
objectives: (i) rationalizing the investment program, based upon more
realistic planning, increasing attention to demand management, and refocusing
resources on high priority activities within the subsector; and (ii)
addressing the present institutional problems facing the subsector, in
particular the severe shortage of experienced professional staff and TEK's
lack of financial autonomy.
2.24      The Government is committed to action toward resolving some of these
issues and has already initiated relevant legislation and debate, particularly
on institutional reform. For example, the Government recently passed a law
which will integrate TEK and the distribution activities formerly under the
municipalities, a long-standing Bank recommendation included also in the
1/ TURKEY: Power Subsector Study, Report No. 3682-TU.



- 11 -
subsector report. MENR and TEK have also initiated other actions consistent
with long standing Bank recommendations, and included in the subsector report,
e.g., the creation of ELTEM-TEK (para 3.10), and the appointment of a
coordinator of investment programs in MENR (para 2.15).
Strategy and Planned Assistance
2.25     The subsector dialogue between the Bank and TEK has been constructive
and a consensus has been reached on the problems facing the subsector.
However, Bank experience to date suggests that progress toward resolving the
subsectoral problems can be achieved only over a long and sustained period.
The Bank strategy for dealing with these problems includes efforts within the
framework of project lending, structural adjustment lending, technical
assistance loans and further sector work.
2.26     TEK and the Bank have agreed that a coordinated and phased program of
technical assistance will be necessary to upgrade the subsector and have
identified the following high priority areas:
(i)    Management and organization of the distribution
enterprises, and rehabilitation and extension of urban
networks;
(ii)    Load research, demand management, conservation and tariffs;
(iii)    Manpower development and training;
(iv)    Management information systems;
(v)    Generation and transmission planning; and
(vi)    Thermal plant maintenance.
The key areas for assistance are items (i) to (iv) above and they are included
in the Project (para 3.02 (b)). The other items for assistance would be
financed under future power loans. Annex 2.5 summarizes the immediate
technical assistance program proposed by the Bank.
2.27     Manpower.  To deal with the lack of trained manpower the Bank would
assist TEK in developing its existing training centers, upgrading the quality
of instructors and course content, and improving training of both technical
operating staff and accounting staff. Recruitment and retention of staff
would be enhanced by the high quality of in-service training offered by TEK.
The Bank proposes to address the low civil service salaries issue through
advocacy and legal reform in the context of the proposed Structural Adjustment
Loan (SAL IV) as well as give support, in the Project, to the recent
initiatives of TEK in assisting in the creation of ELTEM-TEK, the private
sector consulting firm (para 3.10). ELTEM-TEK, since it remains outside the
rigid SEE personnel laws, will be able to pay higher than civil service
salaries and should attract highly qualified staff from the private sector.



- 12 -
2.28     Management Systems.  Inadequate corporate planning in TEK has, in
part, been a function of the inadequate information system in existence. The
system does not assist management in assessing the financial implications of
long-term development plans. The Bank will finance, under the Project,
technical assistance to improve the timeliness and usefulness of financial
reports.
2.29     Distribution.  The most immediate institutional challenge facing TEK
is the organization and operation of the recently integrated distribution
activities (para 2.12) and the creation of the regional enterprises
(para 4.08). To follow up on an EdF diagnostic study to be completed in
mid-1983 (para 4.10), TEK has agreed to engage consultancy services to:
(i) provide overall guidance to the management of TEK on the organization and
operation of distribution enterprises; and (ii) prepare specific detailed
technical and economic feasibility studies on the rehabilitation of the urban
networks. Given the complexity and diversity of the various consulting tasks
the Bank also proposes that, under the FY84 sector work program, a review of
the various studies and an action plan be prepared. Further technical
assistance, as defined at that time, would be included in future project
lending.
2.30     Planning.  The Bank is currently preparing, in cooperation with the
International Atomic Energy Agency, a report on planning and investment in the
electricity subsector (including a detailed review of the current investment
program) and will present its findings to the Turkish authorities for
discussion and comment. The report will include a program of actions
including technical assistance and training, especially for generation and
transmission, which would be included in future Bank projects. However, a
fundamental planning problem identified by the sector mission is the
inadequate collection and analysis of load data. The first step in improving
system planning is the development of realistic load and demand forecasts.
Technical assistance to assist TEK's planning department to collect and
analyze load data and develop a comprehensive load management program is
included in the Project.
2.31     TEK is only in the preliminary stage of preparing a medium-term
investment program for distribution. The technical assistance program for
urban distribution will assist TEK in the preparation of a realistic
investment program. The Bank has been a long standing advocate of increasing
the share of investment for distribution network rehabilitation. Future
project lending will be geared to redressing the imbalance in the investment
program by concentrating on transmission, distribution and rehabilitation of
existing generation.
2.32     Other issues which will have an impact on improved planning and
investment decisions relate to the quality of maintenance, especially of
thermal plants, which appear to have unusually low capacity utilization rates
(para 2.08). The Bank plans to investigate this further during subsequent
sector and supervision missions with a view to addressing the issue under
future project lending.



- 13 -
2.33     Pricing.  The Bank-financed tariff study, prepared in 1975 (para
2.17) is now outdated and does not form an adequate basis for discussions
regarding the economic cost of supplying electricity to consumers. A tariff
study is included in the technical assistance for load research and load
management (para 3.14). The tariff study will be carried out in two stages:
a full diagnostic report to be completed by September 30, 1984 and the final
report to be completed by July 31, 1985. TEK has agreed to furnish to the
Bank the findings and recommendations of the reports promptly upon their
completion; and, thereafter implement such recommendations as shall have been
agreed upon between TEK and the Bank. The Bank will continue to press for an
increase in level and improved structure of electricity tariffs so that prices
may more adequately reflect the long run marginal cost as well as provide a
reasonable level of internally generated cash to finance future investment
costs.

III. THE PROJECT
The Program and the Project
3.01     To provide adequate transmission capacity for TEK's widespread power
system (para 2.11), TEK and consultants prepared a least-cost, long-term
(10-15 years) bulk transmission construction program in 1974. The program is
updated regularly to take account of changes in TEK's load growth and
generation patterns. The most recent update in December 1982 (para 6.03)
showed that the proposed Project is the least-cost means of interconnecting
the next stage of generation coming on stream by 1986 (para 2.08).
Construction of the lines in the Project will allow full utilization of
generating capacity under construction to ensure a continued supply of
electricity to the growing demand on TEK's interconnected network.
3.02     The Project is part of the Borrower's current 1982-1986 development
plan and consists of the following parts:
(a)  The construction and placing into operation of about 1,500 km of
380-kV transmission lines, including series capacitors, to
interconnect Karakaya, Oymapinar, Altinkaya, Yatagan and Yenikoy
power stations to the Borrower's bulk supply system (see Map
IBRD 17075). Annex 3.1 lists the specific lines and their
characteristics.
(b) Technical assistance for the Borrower to:
(i) address organizational, financial, technical and
operational problems posed by the recent transfer to TEK
of municipal power distribution assets throughout
Turkey, including feasibility studies on distribution
rehabilitation and extension;
(ii) prepare and implement a program of load research, tariff
studies, demand management and energy conservation
leading to utilization of the Borrower's existing and
future assets;
(iii)  start the implementation of a long-term manpower
development and training program; and
(iv) improve TEK's existing accounting and billing systems
and introduce the first stage of a management
information system.
Status of Engineering
3.03     TEK's 380-kV network has been planned in line with traditional
contingency criteria for the system to withstand faults without system
separation, line overloading, cascade tripping or loss of load. Possible
disturbances and faults were classified as "lst contingencies" and "2nd
contingencies".  The 1st contingencies are the incidents most likely to
occur. The 2nd contingencies are more serious incidents, but with lower
probability of occurrence. In the Turkish system, the following planning
criteria apply:



- 15 -
(a) 1st Contingencies--Three-phase faults in any one line followed
by permanent trip-out of the faulty line. All lines in service
prior to the fault.
(b) 2nd Contingencies--Permanent faults, simultaneous or a short
time apart, on two lines in the same right-of-way at peak load;
a fault at one bus bar in a substation; a three-phase fault in
line followed by successful reclosing, while another line in the
same area is out of service.
3.04     To ascertain adequate design for each new extension of the 380-kV
network, including the proposed Project, specific studies are carried out in
the following areas:
(a) Load flows for normal and emergency conditions;
(b) Energization of long lines;
(c) Transient and steady state stability;
(d) Switching surges and dynamic overvoltages;
(e) Short circuits;
(f) Mechanical and electrical design; and
(g) Optimum Line Routing.
3.05     Basic design for the Project is on hand, and equipment and materials
have been standardized in accordance with criteria established during previous
construction of 380-kV transmission lines in the Borrower's network.
Following the mechanical failure of several 380-kV lines caused by ice and
wind in 1975-1980, TEK has revised the mechanical design criteria for 380-kV
lines to take into account the findings of extensive investigations conducted
by TEK and consultants. Specifically the new specifications call for span
lengths not to exceed 500 m, less sagging of center phase conductors, and ACSR
conductors with a ratio of aluminum-to-steel sections of about 8/1. In
addition, all lattice towers are to have square instead of the rectangular
bases previously specified. Other minor modifications have also been included
in the improved design. Rights-of-way have been obtained and bidding
documents will be issued starting in July 1983. The Borrower's engineering
department is capable of preparing detailed project design and requires only
highly specialized outside technical assistance in a few areas. No
difficulties are foreseen in maintaining adequate flow of construction
drawings to the installation and erection contractors.

Note:  1.  Total physical contingencies are about 10% of base cost; local
price contingencies are about 44%, and foreign price contingencies
are about 17% of the respective base costs plus physical
contingencies. Specific annual increases in domestic and
international prices were assumed as follows:
1983     1984      1985        1986     1987
Local             20%       17%      15%         12%       12%

2.  Under existing regulations, the Project would be exempt from import
taxes and duties through 1983.  TEK plans to apply for an extension
to the end of the Project, December 1986, and expects little
difficulty obtaining it. During negotiations, the Bank received
Government assurances that the exemption will be extended.



- 17 -
Given the difficult terrain and climatic conditions in the project areas, the
resulting unit cost of about $16(,000/km of 380-kV lines with bundled
conductors appears reasonable.
3.07     The estimated cost of consultants include (i) man-month rate; (ii)
reimbursable items; and (iii) subsistence and other allowances in Turkey.
Uther expenses under technical assistance would be for computer hardware and
software, audio-visual training aids and other didactic equipment and
materials, as well as for overseas training of Turkish instructor-trainees.
Project Financing Plan
3.08     The proposed loan of US$163 million would cover about 95% of the
foreign cost of the Project, excluding interest during construction. For the
balance, co-financing has been arranged for up to US$6.3 million and
negotiations are in progress for an additional US$2.5 million. The local cost
-- US$81.1 million equivalent -- and the rest of the foreign exchange required
-- US$41.7 million /a -- would be financed by the Government and the Borrower
as part of the planned 1983-1987 subsector investment program.  To ensure
timely availability of local currency funds TEK would establish a TL revolving
fund (para 3.21). A summary of the Project financing plan is given in Table
3.2 below.

Implementation
3.09     Construction would start in late 1983 and be completed in late 1986,
in step with the commissioning dates of Karakaya, Oymapinar, Altinkaya,
Yatagan and Yenikoy power stations. Implementation of the Project would also
/a Including $35.1 million of interest during construction.



- 18 -
be coordinated with TEK's construction program for 380-kV substations.
Annex 3.3 shows a composite implementation schedule. Although TEK is close to
completing negotiations for several 380-kV substations under turnkey
supplier-financed contracts, to avoid the possibility of slippages the award
of contracts for all the substations related to the Project (see Annex 3.4),
would be a coildition of loan effectiveness.
3.10     There is a need to strengthen TEK's project management capabilities
to ensure efficient implementation of the Project. The engagement of project
management consultants satisfactory to the Bank under terms and conditions
satisfactory also to the Bank would be an additional condition of loan
effectiveness. TEK plans to engage the services of ELTEM-TEK, a private local
consulting firm owned jointly by TEK, Cukurova, Kepez and other power
subsector enterprises (see Annex 3.5). This arrangement would be
satisfactory, subject to Bank review of ELTEM-TEK's capabilities. ELTEM-TEK
was established by TEK and the other partners in 1982 to attract and retain
experienced power industry professionals without being constrained by the
civil service and salary regulations applicable to TEK and other State
Economic Enterprises. By statute, ELTEM-TEK is barred from recruiting civil
servants in active duty, but intends instead to tap the private sector.
ELTEM-TEK would also seek technical support from abroad as required.
3.11     Stringing of conductors and shield wires would be carried out as
follows: one half by local contractors, and the other half by TEK's own crews
(force account). Based on recent TEK experience, no adverse effect on project
cost is anticipated. TEK and local transmision line contractors have ample
380-kV line construction capability (see Annex 3.6).
Technical Assistance
3.12     To introduce improvements in the organization and operating
procedures of the 18 recently formed electricity distribution enterprises, TEK
has agreed to select and appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank no later
than December 31, 1983, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
This technical assistance component is estimated at 170 man-months.
3.13     TEK has also agreed to select and employ consultants satisfactory to
the Bank no later than December 31, 1983, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, for about 50 man-months to conduct feasibility
studies for rehabilitation and extension of the urban distribution networks.
The studies would be carried out in close coordination with the work of the
consultants in para 3.12 above. The studies would be completed by June 30,
1985 and the recommendations implemented in consultation with the Bank.
3.14     As the first stage in improving overall system planning, TEK has
agreed to select and appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank no later
than December 31, 1983, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank,
to undertake a load research, demand management and energy conservation study,
estimated to require about 300 man-months. This would include technical
assistance for carrying out a tariff study aimed at estimating the long-run
marginal costs of supply at the high, medium and low voltage levels. The
tariff study would be completed in two stages (para 2.33).



- 19 -
3.15     To strengthen manpower development at TEK, the Project will have a
training component under which TEK has also agreed to engage training
consultants no later than December 31, 1983 under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. The consultants would assist TEK in preparing
specifications for training equipment to be financed under the Project, and
provide other assistance in manpower planning and training of both technical
and accounting staff, estimated to require about 80 man-months. TEK has also
agreed to submit an action plan for the training program by March 31, 1984 for
the Bank's comment and approval.
3.16     To improve accounting and management information systems, TEK has
also agreed to engage consultants (about 210 man-months) by December 31, 1983,
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.  Furthermore, TEK has
agreed to submit an action plan by March 31, 1984, for the Bank's comment and
approval, showing the steps to be taken by TEK management and staff in
collaboration with the consultants.
Procurement
3.17     Five separate contracts would be awarded for the supply of ACSR
conductors (US$63.7 million), shield wire (US$4.7 million), insulators
(US$17.9 million) hardware assemblies (US$15.9 million) and series capacitors
(US$4 million) after ICB. The contract for the supply and erection of steel
towers (US$94.6) would also be awarded under ICB procedures. Up to 15%
domestic preference would be allowed for locally manufactured goods. Local
firms are expected to be competitive for the ACSR contract and for the supply
and erection of towers. Training manuals and other miscellaneous training
aids and computer software packages would be purchased through limited
international bidding for items of less than US$10,000 up to an aggregate
limit of US$300,000, by shopping with at least three price quotations. The
steel towers and conductors financed by ESF would be purchased in accordance
with their regulations. Consultants for training and technical assistance
would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines and employed under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. All works contracts and equipment
and materials contracts financed by the Bank and costing over US$250,000 each
would be subject to prior Bank review. Other Bank-financed contracts would be
subject to post-award review.
Disbursements
3.18     Disbursements from the loan supported by full documentation, would be
made for:
(a)  100% of the foreign cost of imported equipment and materials and
100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment
and materials.
(b)  15% of the total expenditures for erection of steel towers.
(c)  100% of the total expenditures for foreign and local consultants
and training experts engaged under the Project.
(d)  100% of the foreign expenditures for overseas training, training
aids, and computer hardware and software packages.



- 20 -
3.19     Savings resulting from favorable prices would be cancelled from the
loan amount. Disbursement should be completed by June 30, 1987. An estimated
schedule of disbursement is given in Annex 3.7 and a comparison with the
actual disbursement profile of TEK Transmission Project II (Loan 1194-TU) is
shown in Annex 3.8. The approximately four years advantage shown for the
proposed loan reflects the resolution of the land acquisition difficulties
encountered during implementation of TEK Transmission Project II, and the
better packaging of the contracts being financed out of the proposed loan.
The prevailing disbursement profile for power projects in the entire EMENA
Region is also shown in Annex 3.8 for reference.
Environmental Impact
3.20     As in the case of TEK Transmission Project II, the impact of the
Project on the environment is small. Visual effects and to a lesser extent
noise are the principal adverse effects. Both would be kept at acceptable
levels.
Project Risks
3.21     Most of the Project is in mountainous areas difficult to reach.
However, adequate construction technology is available to cope with the
expected terrain and climatic conditions, and physical risks are manageable.
In addition, the proposed use of consultants to assist TEK in supervising
construction (para 3.10) would help offset TEK's weaknesses in project
implementation, and provide improved coordination with construction of
substations and power plants affecting the Project. Problems with land
acquisition, which delayed implementation of TEK Transmission II (Loan
1194-TU), have been resolved (para 3.05). Availability of TL funds, however,
could be a critical factor in ensuring timely completion of the Project. To
prevent delays on account of TL shortages, TEK has agreed to establish a
revolving fund adequate to carry out the Project in a timely manner.

IV. IHE PROJECT ENTITY
Background
4.01     The borrower, the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK), is a State
Economic Enterprise established in October 1970, with a mandate to plan and
construct thermal power plants, transmission networks and implement the rural
electrification program; and to sell electricity at the bulk supply level.
TEK has recently assumed responsibility for direct sales to all consumers, and
for construction, operation and maintenance of urban distribution systems
effective November 1, 1982.
4.02     TEK is subject to the SEE Law (No. 440) and the State Personnel Law
(No. 637). Both laws have contributed to restricting TEK's financial and
administrative autonomy. The reduction of the SEEs' financial dependence on
the Government and improvement in the efficiency of these enterprises are
major goals of the structural adjustment program in Turkey. The Bank has
supported this program through SAL I, II and III. Modifications to the SEE
laws, approved by the Government during May 1983, are expected to lead to
reforms which would affect TEK as well as other SEE's, including the expansion
of management autonomy and the liberalization of employment and salary
practices.
Organization and Management
4.03     The current organizational structure of TEK is shown in Annex 4.1.
While there have been six General Managers appointed since 1970, the
mnanagement of the company has consistently emphasized centralized operations
and electricity generation in particular, with much less importance given to
financial policy, demand management or training. The only significant
organizational change since the establishment of TEK is the recent takeover of
municipal electricity distribution, resulting in the merging of rural
electrification with urban distribution under one Assistant General Manager,
and the creation of semi-autonomous distribution companies (paras 4.07-4.11).
This change, which is strongly supported by TEK officials, is expected to be
favorable to TEK and the performance of the overall power subsector.
4.04     In the past, organizational flexibility has been limited and change
has not come about easily. Soon after TEK was formed as a consolidation of a
number of regional and functionally specialized agencies, TEK commissioned
Electricite de France (EdF) to carry out a study to recommend improvements to
TEK's organizational structure and operating procedures. A 1967 IBRD
Technical Assistance Grant for US$1.95 million financed the EdF study as well
as the introduction of improved accounting practices and training provided by
Arthur Young & Co.  The Bank encouraged the Government and TEK to implement
fully the proposed new organization, with covenants to that effect being
included in subsequent loans: Loan 1023-TU: Elbistan Power and Loan 1194-TU:
TEK Transmission II.



- 22 -
4.05     The recommendations of the 1973 study included: the delegation of
more authority to the five Assistant General Managers, a restructuring of the
departments of TEK, and the decentralization to six regional offices of most
of the system operation and maintenance activities. While TEK's management
approved these recommendations in principle in 1973, no comprehensive progress
was made toward implementing them. A brief experiment between 1979 and 1982
with establishment of regional offices in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir, has now
been discontinued. Financial and human resource constraints have also tended
to encourage continued centralization.
4.06     In the context of a less restrictive legal framework for SEE's, there
would be room to introduce improvements to the organizational structure and
management practices at TEK. Pending legal reform, it will still be useful
for TEK management to analyze and communicate the costs of existing legal
constraints to the Government. As a first step in this direction, an internal
TEK task force prepared a paper in early 1983 for the Government commission
reviewing the SEE Law. The paper contained some preliminary proposals on how
TEK would operate in an environment of greater autonomy. Currently top
managers, overwhelmed by the immediate problems of ambitious construction
projects and coping with increasing system demand, do not have enough time to
assess long-term prospects or actively try to shape the environment in which
TEK operates. Changes in the role and composition of the Board of Directors
would encourage a more outward looking top management, focused on
relationships with TEK's major customers and with the Government. The Bank
has discussed with TEK and TEK has indicated that the existing internal task
force would continue to meet to evaluate this and other possible
organizational changes.
Transfer of Electricity Distribution to TEK
4.07     The staff, assets and the responsibility for operation and
maintenance of municipal electricity distribution are being transferred to TEK
incrementally as shown in the schedule below.
Number of Municipalities                  Date of Transfer to TEK
67                                 November 1, 1982
239                                 February 1, 1983
300                                 June 1, 1983
1,119                                 Mid 1983 to Oct. 1984
1,725                                 Total
The three largest municipalities which account for over 50% of municipal sales
(Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir), were among those absorbed by TEK in the first
group in November 1982. Because the municipal agencies involved in
electricity distribution had also been undertaking other activities such as
urban transport and water supply, there are some disagreements arising over
the designation of vehicles, buildings and staff which had been employed for



- 23 -
several activities. Committees consisting of three members -- representative
of TEK, the municipality, and the Ministry of Energy -- are being established
to resolve such disputes, and to determine the financial cost of the
transfer.
4.08     To decentralize its electricity distribution operations, TEK has
created eighteen semi-autonomous regional enterprises. TEK will deliver bulk
electricity to these distribution companies. These companies, having 67
district subdivisions, will in turn serve all customers within their
territory. Each distribution company is to have its own Board of Directors,
and "coordinators" to manage each new company have been named.
4.09     In taking over responsibility for municipal distribution, TEK is
faced with a number of organizational and operational problems. Fundamental
questions about the actual degree of autonomy of the distribution companies
and how their investments will be financed have not been resolved. Billing
procedures and technical standards are not uniform among the municipalities.
Data on existing facilities are lacking, and investment requirements for
network expansion and rehabilitation have been largely ignored. Losses are
high, due both to the poor physical condition of the networks and to the
number of unbilled consumers of electricity. The staff transferred to TEK
vary in the level of their technical and administrative skills.
4.10     Recognizing these difficulties, TEK has engaged Electricite de France
(EdF) to provide a diagnosis of retail pricing, and urban distribution losses
at the distribution level to be completed by September, 1983. Following up on
this study, EdF will develop detailed recommendations and assist with
implementation of new technical and administrative procedures, including
engineering and materials standardization and inventory control, for the 18
distribution enterprises (para 3.12).
4.11     Although this component is not being financed by the Bank, the Bank
will have the opportunity to comment on the detailed work plan to be developed
for the consultants, and to receive and comment on all progress reports and
detailed studies prepared by the consultants at the time they are submitted to
TEK. It will be highly important that the distribution enterprises
demonstrate the potential success of decentralization, possibly setting the
stage for consideration of further steps in this direction in the future.
Manpower Development
4.12     The rapid expansion of electricity supply in Turkey has been
accompanied by an almost equally rapid increase in the number of people
employed by TEK. The total number of staff as of April 1983, was about 55,000
including 35,000 recently transferred to TEK from the municipalities. Among
its large number of employees, TEK benefits from the efforts and skills of a
relatively small pool of dedicated and competent technical, management and
administrative staff. TEK is highly vulnerable to the departure of key staff
members who seek better salaries and a better professional environment in the
private sector. Many of the staff are unskilled and others seem to be
misallocated among TEK's different services and operations. Among those staff
who do have university degrees, many lack the appropriate specialized



- 24 -
training. A detailed breakdown of TEK's staff, showing levels of education
and areas of responsibility is provided in Annex 4.2.
4.13     Middle level technical and administrative staff at TEK are severely
lacking, representing less than 10% of the total staff, and in many cases are
too overburdened to carry out their responsibilities fully. In contrast a
surplus number of lower level staff are attached to central administrative
services. A disproportionately large number of staff are assigned to the
operation of electricity generation and transmission facilities, representing
as much as 50% of the number of staff involved in electricity distribution. A
disproportionately small number of staff are assigned to maintenance of the
system as compared with operation.
4.14     The Government has recognized the problem of overstaffing and has now
placed constraints on the expansion of TEK's staff. Because of uncertainty of
obtaining Government approval for personnel changes, manpower planning at TEK
is not conducted as a serious long-term exercise. Manpower planning is
presently conducted no more than a year in advance, and applications for
increases in the number of staff do not reflect attempts to correct some of
the imbalances mentioned above.
Training
4.15     Presently training at TEK focuses primarily on development of
technical operational staff, an orientation encouraged by the fact that it is
the Assistant General Manager for Operations who supervises the Training
Department and controls the budget for training. TEK is running three
technical training facilities, the largest of which, adjacent to the Soma A
thermal plant, has extensive laboratory capacity and models related to thermal
electricity generation. However, much of the equipment is out of date.
Courses have also been held at the Golbashi and Adapazari centers dealing with
transmission, safety and topography. Instructional materials dealing with
transmission, distribution and overall system reliability are lacking. For
the operation and maintenance of hydroelectric power facilities, staff have
been developed only through "on the job" observation, although a plan to
create a hydro training facility at Oymapinar is under consideration.
Training of the new staff joining TEK in the area of electricity distribution
has now also become a priority. A previously closed training facility at
Topkapi near Istanbul will be reopened, and there are plans to create two
other centers at Ankara and Izmir.
4.16     All of the training centers are used at less than full capacity due
largely to the shortage of instructors; only the Soma facility has permanent
training staff. According to existing personnel guidelines, training staff do
not receive the same compensation which would be available to the same
individuals if they were holding operating or planning jobs. In the absence
of more flexible personnel guidelines, expansion of training staff will be
possible only if such staff are officially designated as holding other jobs.
Under the Project, the technical training staff will need to be supplemented
by at least 20 engineers or senior technicians, plus about 8 individuals who
would receive instruction overseas to be developed as trainers of trainers.



- 25 -
4.17     The Project will address the need to strengthen manpower development
at TEK through upgrading technical training facilities, developing a stronger
training staff, and supporting training for accounting and planning staff. An
outline of the scope and objectives of this component is provided in Annex
4.3. The proposed program is also intended to solidify the position of the
Training Department within the organization. Although TEK management is
considering a scheme where each of TEK's various branches and services would
have a separate training unit, this is not considered advisable because of the
risk of dissipating the existing staff resources. Instead, the joining of the
Training and the Personnel Departments under the same Assistant General
Manager will be an objective of the Project, in order to strengthen the role
of both activities and to improve coordination. A proposal by the Training
Director to have the manpower development plan and training budget evaluated
and approved by a committee with representatives from all the major parts of
the organization, could, if implemented, extend the scope and effectiveness of
training with TEK.

V. FINANCE
Summary
5.01      The Yiggest obstacle to improvement in TEK's financial performance
remains the difficulty in gaining Government approval of electricity tariff
increases beyond direct fuel cost adjustment of tariffs, even in the face of
rising investment needs. TEK's inability to raise adequate revenue, together
with overall constraints on resources for public investment in Turkey, have
combined to restrict directly the size of investments to expand the power
system.  Partly due to its lack of control over tariff setting, TEK management
still treats financial planning as an ex-post exercise. Without giving full
consideration to whether financing will be available for all the investments
that are technically and economically viable, the formulation of the
investment program is instead driven by the objectives of building capacity to
eliminate power shortages and substituting hydropower and lignite for imported
fuels as soon as possible. The necessity for closer coordination between
financial and technical planning is only now being recognized by TEK. The
importance of directing limited funds to those projects closest to a
revenue-earning stage still needs to be further emphasized within the
company.
Recent Financial Performance
5.02      Trends in the economic environment in Turkey in the last several
years have had a direct and significant impact on TEK's financial position.
Both operating costs and investment costs have jumped due to high local
inflation rates (105%, 37% and 23% per annum in 1980, 1981 and 1982
respectively) and to the corresponding depreciation of the Turkish Lira (about
40% per annum against the US dollar from 1980 to 1982). These economic trends
have combined with problems in collecting revenues from municipal customers,
who have diverted electricity revenues into other urban services, to erode
TEK's liquidity and create some difficulties in meeting debt service
obligations. TEK's working capital position as of December 31 for 1980-1982
is summarized in Table 5.1. Apparently, TEK's only way of financing working
capital requirements, and in some cases investments, has been to delay
payments to suppliers. TPAO, the supplier of fuel oil, is charging TEK a
below market interest rate of 31.5% per annum for its delayed payments, which
amounted to TL 86.1 billion at the end of 1982.
5.03      It is expected that TEK's liquidity will begin to improve in 1983.
Because of the transfer of municipal distribution assets to TEK effective
November 1982 (see paras 4.07-4.11 on reorganization of TEK), TEK is already
benefitting from being able to collect directly from customers. Consequently,
by an agreement reached between TEK, TPAO and the Ministry of Finance, TEK
began to pay fuel bills received from TPAO after January 1, 1983, on a timely
basis.

(A/B) Current Ratio                 .8                 .7                .7
5.04     As an indication that TEK's management will take all necessary steps
to improve the company's working capital and avoid financing long-term
investments with short-term credits, during negotiations it was agreed that
TEK would maintain a current ratio (defined as current assets divided by
current liabilities) of at least 0.7 by the end of 1983, and increase this
ratio to 1.0 by the end of 1984. Thereafter, the current ratio should be kept
above 1.0.
5.05     Although TEK is highly exposed to risk from foreign exchange
fluctuations, increases in electricity tariffs have failed to take into
account the impact of these fluctuations on TEK's costs, in particular on its
investments (about 50% of which are in foreign exchange) and on its debt
service. The depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the US Dollar averaged
about 40% p.a. during the 1980-1982 period. As a result the TL value of
existing foreign obligations has increased, as reflected in TEK's balance
sheets. Foreign exchange losses in 1980-1982 added TL 102.7 billion
altogether to the value of TEK's outstanding foreign borrowings, an amount
equivalent to almost half the book value of fixed assets in service in
1982.
5.06     A further repercussion of the TL depreciation, with more immediate
consequences, is that TEK has had increasing difficulty in meeting its foreign
debt service obligations. Payments to external creditors for TEK's loans have
been made on a timely basis by the Central Bank. The Treasury then reimburses
the Central Bank on TEK's behalf. TEK's books reflect delays in reimbursing
the full equivalent TL amounts to the Treasury, but TEK attributes this to
delays in receiving transfers from the Treasury. The Bank has emphasized the
importance of TEK keeping up with timely debt service payments in order to
maintain its creditworthiness.



- 28 -
5.07      The likely extent of foreign exchange losses and their impact on
operating and capital costs is apparently never foreseen or allowed for in the
annual capital budgeting procedures followed by TEK. This is of significant
concern because required tariffs are underestimated as a result and because
continued failure to allow adequately for the TL cost of its foreign debt
service could detract from TEK's overall creditworthiness. It was agreed
during negotiations that TEK will include in its annual budgets, as submitted
to the Government, contingency amounts to cover the likely impact of exchange
rate changes on operating and capital costs, starting with the fiscal year
1984 budget exercise. (To estimate expected TL depreciation, it would be
possible to take the differential between the forecast international and
domestic inflation rates, or alternatively the Central Bank would provide an
appropriate estimate.)
Financial Implications of Transfer of Municipal Distribution Assets
5.08      By gaining control over electricity distribution, TEK should benefit
from an improved cash flow, as long as these additional revenues are adequate
to cover operating expenses at the distribution level. In addition, a law was
passed in early 1983 facilitating the procedures by which new electricity
customers can apply for service. In Ankara alone, 30,000 new applications
were received in one month, many from homes which had already been illegally
connected to the network and had lacked the certification of land ownership
which had previously been required. The new procedures should eventually lead
to a reduction in the extent of losses due to unmetered consumption.
5.09      As of mid-1983, no data was available on the overall financial impact
of the transfer. According to the terms of Law 2705, TEK owes to each
municipality the book value of assets, less accumulated depreciation, less any
unpaid bills for purchase of bulk electricity. Advance collections, made by
some municipalities for estimated consumption after November 1, 1982, will
also be subtracted from any amounts owed by TEK. The reconciliation of
accounts between TEK and the larger municipalities is expected to be completed
by December 31, 1984, and for the remaining municipalities by December 31,
1985. The Treasury intends to supply the funds either owed to TEK or owed by
TEK as the case may be with each municipality. Although the accounts of the
eighteen distribution enterprises will eventually be consolidated with those
of TEK, the Bank has requested in the interim to receive these accounts
separately for purposes of reviewing performance and compliance with financial
covenants.
5.10      TEK agreed to submit to the Bank no later than June 30, 1984, a
report defining the capital structure of the new distribution enterprises.
This would include a description of the practices to be followed in financing
capital expenditures in urban distribution, through internally generated
funds, through borrowing, or through Government equity.
5.11      In the monitoring of TEK's financial performance, revenues, operating
expenses, and capital expenditures associated with urban distribution would be
excluded from the calculation of the cash generation ratio until December 31,
1984, or by another date to which the Bank and TEK agree, when there will be
sufficient data to take into account both the operating results and the
ongoing and planned investments of the distribution companies.  In the
interim, the ratios will be applied to TEK, as it operated previously, an
entity supplying bulk electricity before consolidation of accounts.

Revenue Performance and Tariff Levels
5.12      Since the signing of the Loan Agreement for the Karakaya Hydropower
Project (Loan No. 1844-TU) in May, 1980 the Bank has been monitoring the
adequacy of TEK's tariff levels by looking at the share of investment costs
coverea by internally generated funds. Accordingly, TEK is required to take
any actions, not limited to changes in the structure or overall level of its
electricity rates, as necessary to generate funds from internal sources
equivalent to not less that 20% of annual capital expenditures of TEK and DSI
for power projects in 1981, gradually increasing to 35% by 1986. In 1981, 19%
of investment was funded from internally generated resources, and in 1982, a
16% cash generation ratio was achieved, according to preliminary results.
(These estimates are based on the amount of debt service due rather than the
lower amount of debt service actually paid.)

5.13      Even though the definition of net funds from internal sources
includes changes in working capital other than cash, 1/ TEK's compliance with
the revenue covenant in 1981 should not obscure the fact that tariffs were not
adequate to meet liquidity as well as investment requirements. In 1981,
working capital was reduced from an already negative position. If, for this
reason, these i,ductions are not counted as a source of internal cash
available to finance new investments, the result for the cash generation ratio
is instead 12% for 1981.
5.14      Some immediate problems are foreseen for TEK's financial position in
the next two years. An increase in the average bulk supply tariff of about
30%, which was proposed in February, did not receive Government approval.
Revenue needs are expected to be high in 1983, because poor hydrological
conditions have necessitated operating expensive oil-fired thermal units,
normally used only for peaking, at high levels to meet load demand. Delays in
completing less expensive hydro and lignite-fired plants have constrained
electricity supply. Furthermore, the cost of TEK's planned investments is
almost twice that of 1982 (TL 210 billion as compared with TL 113 billion).
5.15      Based on the 15% increase in tariffs effective June 1, 1983, and a
second 15. increase which the Government agreed would occur on or before
December 1, 1983, it is estimated that in 1983 TEK would have internally
generated funds sufficient to finance only about 12% of the planned
investments in the power subsector. It would then be difficult to obtain the
previously covenanted level of 29% internal cash generation in 1984, requiring
over a 50% nominal or 33% real increase in tariffs.
5.16      In the light of these circumstances it was agreed that the Government
would continue to take or cause TEK to take measures necessary to attain the
following levels of internal cash generation:
1983                         12%
1984                         21%
1985                         32%
1986 and afterwards          35%
Since the targets agreed to during negotiations for 1983 and 1984 were lower
than previously covenanted, the Karakaya Loan Agreement has been amended
accordingly 2/. The revised internal cash generation target for 1984 will
require that TEK obtain an average revenue during the year of TL 11.0 for each
unit of electricity sold at the high voltage level. The specific level of
nominal and real tariff increases needed to generate this average revenue
will, of course, depend upon the timing of tariff increases during the
12-month period. If the increase occurs on May 1, 1984, tariffs would have to
1/ As defined in Loan Agreement for Loan 1844-TU, Section 4.08.
2/ Amendments were agreed to Supplemental Letter No. 3, referring to Section
4.08 of the Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank,
Loan 1844-TU.



- 31 -
go up 10% in real terms to obtain the required average revenue for 1984. 1/
If tariff increases are delayed, larger increases will be needed to obtain the
same average revenue for the year.
5.17     After 1984, the extent of the required tariff increases is much less
certain due to the possibility of further exchange rate fluctuations, higher
than expected local intlation, and changes in the pattern of sales growth.
Forecasts of TEK's financial performance in current prices and consistent with
the agreed financial ratios are shown in Annexes 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3. The
assumptions on which these forecasts are based are outlined in Annex 5.4. A
summary of indicators of TEK's financial performance is shown in Table 5.3.
The calculations have been based on the official power investment program,
adjusted to take account of: expected delays in commissioning dates of some
plants; expected local and foreign inflation during the forecast period; and
additional amounts for unidentified projects toward the end of the period. Of
course any forecast of TEK's performance is highly sensitive to assumptions
made in forecasting sales. While sales may be expected to jump later in the
1980's when new plant commissionings enable TEK to satisfy demand previously
unmet TEK's forecasts of sales growth appear too high, not taking supply
constraints adequately into consideration (see para 2.07). Another
uncertainty in the forecasts is the level of absorbtive capacity for planned
capital expenditures, which will need to be monitored closely.
5.16     Extending the agreements reached under Loan 1844-TU, TEK and the
Government will present to the Bank not later than December 31 of each year
the power subsector investment plan for the following year, and the related
financing plan. This would include a demonstration of how the agreed
financial ratios will be met. The Bank will continue to emphasize that to
improve TEK's financial performance, tariff adjustments will need to be
combined with consolidating and trimming its investment program, reducing
losses, and improving operating efficiency.
5.19     TEK and the Government have reconfirmed the automaticity of the fuel
adjustment clause, establishing that TEK would continue to include in its
electricity supply contracts and enforce a provision that its charges,
including retail electricity tariffs, will be increased automatically to take
account of increases in its fuel costs. An automatic fuel cost adjustment
clause was agreed to in 1971 under Loan 763-TU and again in 1974 under Loan
1023-TU (Section 5.06). Although this practice was eliminated temporarily
during 1976 and 1977 , in recent years TEK has received approval from the
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to increase its tariffs effective
immediately following increases in domestic fuel prices. Tariff increases
have just about kept pace with the impact of rising domestic fuel prices on
TEK's overall operating costs (Annex 5.5).
5.2U     In addition, TEK and the Government confirmed that all future bulk
(high voltage) tariff increases, not limited to fuel cost adjustments, would
be at least fully reflected on the retail (low voltage) level.
1/  i.e., tariffs would be raised from the end-1983 level of TL 9.25/kWh to
TL 11.90; assuming an increase of 17% in the wholesale price index for
1984, this will represent a 27% nominal or a 10% real increase.

Financing Plan
5.21     The financing plan in Table 5.4 refers to the investments to be
carried out by TEK in thermal power generation, transmission and rural
electrification. During the five year forecast period, almost half of the
total power subsector investments are expected to be for construction of
hydroelectric facilities to be carried out by DSI, a non-revenue earning
agency. Therefore, by raising its tariffs to levels sufficient to cover an
increasing share of these total investments through internal cash generation,
TEK will be financing an even greater share of its own investments through
internally generated funds. After paying corporate income taxes, TEK is still
expected to have overall during the five-year forecast period sufficient
internal funds to finance 35% of its own capital expenditures, with the
remainder of the financing coming primarily from foreign borrowing (33%),
local borrowing (6%) and equity contributions from the Treasury (21%).



- 33 -
5.22     Completed hydroelectric power plants are transferred from DSI to TEK
in the form of equity only. The Bank requested under Loan 1844-TU (the
Karakaya Project) that the Government consider a change in accounting
procedures, such that the asset value of these hydro plants would be offset by
a combination of both debt and equity. This change in accounting procedures,
which would make TEK directly responsible for paying DSI's debt service, has
not yet occurred, however, and the cash flow forecasts assume the present
practice will continue.

5.23     Government capital contributions are expected to account for
progressively smaller shares of TEK's financing due to increases in expected
retained earnings with Government equity going instead in much larger amounts
to support DSI's investment program. In maintaining approximately the
presently low debt/equity ratio of 40/60, TEK does not appear to have a risk
of becoming t-oo highly leveraged. In fact, TEK's capacity for additional
long-term borrowing actually appears greater than this, if problems in
covering foreign exchange losses on debt service are resolved.
Accounting and Management Information System
5.24     The Project includes assistance to TEK in improving its financial
reporting system and introducing the first stage of a management information
system. An outline of the scope and objectives of this assistance is provided
in Annex 5.5. In order to build a management information system at TEK there
will be several prerequisites. First, the supporting accounting system, on
which any MIS would be based, will need to be strengthened. A standard
utility chart of accounts was introduced successfully with the assistance of
Stone and Webster in 1968-1970, supported by a Technical Assistance Grant from
the World Bank. Subsequently, Arthur Young & Co. worked with TEK during
1972-1974 to set up reporting procedures, with statements of financial results
(including balance sheets and income statements) to be prepared on a monthly
basis for all of TEK's operations. Initially these procedures were followed,
relying on manual preparation of all statements. However, the system is no
longer fully implemented. A complete set of financial statements using actual
results is now prepared only once a year, making the task of compilation and
reconciliation more difficult and time consuming. Furthermore, starting in
1983, the consolidation of TEK's accounts has become more difficult because
the eighteen newly formed distribution enterprises must be included, as well
as the accounts of individual plants under construction, of the major
generating plants and of the transmission network.
5.25     A second prerequisite for introducing a management information system
at TEK is for managers and staff in the accounting department to become
familiar with data processing concepts and techniques. Currently, the primary
computer applications in TEK's central operations, other than engineering
applications, have been limited following the installation of an IBM 370/138
computer in 1980. The computer is used to keep a personnel inventory and to
process payroll for all civil servants and hourly workers. The end-of-fiscal
year accounts are also totalled using the computer, but all the inputs are
prepared manually. The existing computer facilities are not being used at
full capacity for two major reasons: first, personnel guidelines impede the
employment of programming staff to work additional shifts; and secondly, the
core staff of programmers has not been encouraged to promote expanded
applications for the Accounting Department or for other activities.
5.26     Further data processing capability exists in the Central Anatolia
Electricity Distribution Enterprise, based in Ankara, where a computer system
has been established for the billing of 700,000 customers on a bi-monthly
basis, using a modern data base system, and benefitting from an innovative
manager and skilled staff. Computer capacity is not adequate, however, to



- 35 
convert the present system into a full accounts receivable system for the
enterprise, i.e. having the capability to calculate at any time the total
sales revenue due from individual customers and for the region as a whole.
Automation of billing, practiced only partially in two other regions (Istanbul
and Izmir), appears to be a priority area. Any improvements in accounting
procedures and information systems for the distribution enterprises would need
to be introduced on a pilot basis in one or two enterprises, and ultimately
several larger centers could be relied on to process accounts of other regions
serving a smaller number of customers.
Revaluation
5.27      The practice of revaluation of fixed assets in service was
discontinued by TEK in 1979. According to Law 2791 of January, 1983, TEK and
all other State Economic Enterprises must begin to revalue their assets.
However, the price index stipulated in the law does not appear in line with
historical trends, as this index suggests that inflation in Turkey has been
100l p.a. since 1972, which would result in overvaluing those assets acquired
during 1979-1982 and undervaluing those acquired prior to 1979. At such time
when TEK's fixed assets have been revalued adequately reflecting their
replacement value, the rate of return on assets will become a meaningful
indicator of adequacy of tariffs.
Audits
5.28      As with other State Economic Enterprises, TEK's financial statements
follow the Uniform Chart of Accounts, and are audited by the High Control
Board connected with the Prime Ministry. There are shortcomings with both the
timing and the scope of the present audit reports. The Bank received the 1981
audit report in February, 1983, although a period of no more than 5 months
after the close of TEK's fiscal year had been agreed to previously. This delay
was apparently due to a difference in views between TEK and its auditors about
how to account for additions to the Rural Electrification Fund.   Because
audit reports are useful only if submitted on a timely basis, it was
reconfirmed that TEK would submit its annual audited accounts to the Bank no
later than five months after the close of the year. The time required to
finalize each year's financial results should also be shortened by measures to
improve financial reporting to be supported under the Project.
5.29      A second concern with the existing audit reports relates to their
depth and approach. While the official audit provides a more detailed
breakdown of the aggregated entries appearing in TEK's financial statements
and shows variances between the current and the previous years, this report
only rarely provides an independent assessment of practices or trends having
an impact on how TEK's financial situation is presented. Measures to improve
auditing and accountability of SEE's go beyond the scope of this Project and
it is expected that this will be addressed in the context of reforms being
implemented under the Structural Adjustment Loans.

VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Least-Cost Solution
6.01     The proposed Project is justified as being the least-coot means of
interconnecting the new plants coming on line in the next stage of TEK's
generation construction program as revised by the Bank (para 2.08). The
Project is part of TEK's long-term (10-15 years) transmission expansion plan
first formulated in 1974, on the basis of present worth comparison of
investments and operating costs, including losses, for the following
technically viable alternatives:
(a) A 380-kV system throughout.
(b) A combined 380-kV and 760-kV system.
(c) A combined 380-kV and + 500-kV (DC) system.
6.02     Alternative (a)--380 kV alone--was shown to be the least cost
solution at 12% discount rate, equal to the estimated opportunity cost of
capital in Turkey. On that basis, TEK decided to build the present 380-kV
transmission starting in 1975.
6.03     The 1974 evaluation of transmission expansion alternatives has been
updated regularly to reflect experience with the initial group of lines, as
well as changes in the development of TEK's interconnected system. The latest
technical and economic evaluation in December 1982 confirmed that the lines
included in the Project are the least cost means of extending the 380-kV
network to interconnect the new plants acknowledged by the mission as being
the next stage of generation expansion (para 3.01). The evaluation was
reviewea by the Bank and found satisfactory.
Return on Investment
6.04     Since the Project is an integral part of TEK's 1983-1987 expansion
program it is not possible to calculate the economic rate of return for the
Project alone. Therefore, the economic rate of return on the whole
"timeslice" of TEK's investment program for 1983-1987 (covering the
construction period of the proposed Project) was calculated.
6.05     Measurable benefits were limited to the incremental revenue
attributable to the program, computed on the basis of projected tariffs.
Nominal tariff adjustments were projected as follows: (i) Government stated
increases of 15% each on June 1, 1983 and December 1, 1983; (ii) 27% increase
in tariff levels effective May 1, 1984 required to meet the cash generation
covenant under existing loans; and (iii) the increases necessary to maintain
tariffs at a constant level in real terms thereafter. Real increases
consistent with the above are approximately 12% for 1983 and 10% for 1984.  In
the absence of complete revenue data on all municipalities the estimated
retail tariff for Ankara was used. It was assumed that the projected
increases in high voltage supply would be passed on fully to the retail



- 37 -
level. However, given the large unmet demand (para 2.07) the willingness to
pay for electricity is considerably higher than the current average tariff;
unfortunately, it cannot be quantified.
6.06     The measurable costs encompass:  (i) the capital cost of the program;
(ii) the fuel cost; and (iii) the operation and maintenance costs. Full data
was available for investment costs in generation and transmission. The
available data on future investment costs for distribution is incomplete since
it only extends to the end of 1983. The proposed Project would assist TEK in
developing a longer term comprehensive investment program for the
rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution system (paras 3.12 and
3.13). In the absence of adequate data it has been assumed that investment
costs for distribution would increase from 10% of total subsector investment
(1983) to 20% from 1984 onwards, and operation and maintenance costs would
remain at 2% of annual investment costs. As a result of the increase in
investment, distribution losses are assumed to fall progressively from the
relatively high level of 16% to 10% over a 10-year period. Lignite was valued
at its economic cost, equivalent to the estimated long-run marginal cost of
production. No fuel escalation was assumed because increases in the price of
fuel would be covered by the fuel adjustment clause incorporated in the tariff
structure.
6.07     Under the above assumptions the return on the program (including
distribution) was estimated at 8.4%. Although this is below the opportunity
cost of capital (estimated at 12%), it understates the real return and is not
a true measure of the economic merit of the Project because it excludes the
consumers' surplus. It does, however, reflect the fact that tariffs are set
below the marginal cost of supply. The rate of return on the bulk supply,
i.e., high voltage, was also estimated using investment and operating costs
for generation and transmission, and the projected bulk supply tariff was
taken as the basis for measurable benefits. The rate of return was estimated
at 9.4% which indicates that bulk tariffs are also set below the marginal cost
of bulk supply. A further sensitivity analysis was undertaken in which only
the 1983 increases referred to in para 6.05 and nominal increases required to
maintain tariffs constant in real terms for 1984 and beyond were assumed. In
this case the rate of return on bulk supply was estimated at 7%. Details of
the calculation are given in Annex 6.2, and the assumptions used are shown in
Annex 6.3.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01     The Government will take or cause TEK to take all necessary actions,
including changes in the level or structure of tariffs, to obtain internal
cash generat(,,n, as defined under Loan 1844-TU of the following shares of
capital expenditures in electric power by TEK and DSI: 1982, 16%; 1983, 12%,
1984, 21%; 1985, 32%, and 1986 and thereafter, 35%. 1/ Until December 31,
1984, or such other date as the Bank shall agree, all revenues, expenses and
capital expenditures related to urban distribution of electricity will be
excluded from the calculation of internal cash generation (paras 5.11 and
5.16).
7.02     Government and TEK will:
(a)  take actions necessary to enable TEK to bring its current ratio
(defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) to
0.7 by the end of 1983, to 1.0 by the end of 1984, and to keep
it above 1.0 thereafter (para 5.04);
(b)  take actions necessary to enable TEK to maintain a fuel
adjustment clause in its electricity supply contracts and
enforce a provision that its charges will be increased
automatically to take account of increases in its fuel costs
(para 5.19);
(c)  reflect all increases affecting bulk (high voltage) tariffs,
including fuel cost adjustments, in retail (low voltage) tariffs
(para 5.20);
7.03     TEK will:
(a)  appoint consultants no later than December 31, 1983, to develop
detailed recommendations and to assist with implementation of
technical and administrative improvements and procedures for the
new distribution enterprises, and to conduct feasibility studies
for investments in distribution to be completed by June 30, 1985
(paras 3.12 and 3.13);
(b)  appoint consultants no later than December 31, 1983, to
undertake a load research, demand management and tariff study,
which would include a tariff analysis and formulation component,
the full diagnostic report of which would be completed by
September 30, 1984, and the final report of which would be
completed by July 31, 1985 (paras 2.33 and 3.14).
(c)  appoint training consultants no later than December 31, 1983,
furnish an action plan for a training program to the Bank for
its comments no later than March 31, 1984, and implement a
training program satisfactory to the Bank (para 3.15);
1/ The levels for 1982-1984 have been reflected in an agreed amendment to
Supplementary Letter No. 3 to the Loan Agreement for 1844-TU.



- 39 -
(d)  appoint accounting and management information consultants no
later than December 31, 1983, furnish an action plan for
improvements in its accounting and management information
systems to the Bank no later than March 31, 1984, and implement
a program of such improvements satisfactory to the Bank
(para 3.16);
(e)  establish a TL revolving fund adequate to carry out the Project
in a timely manner (para 3.21);
(f)  submit to the Bank no later than June 30, 1984, a report
explaining the capital structure of the new distribution
enterprises (para 5.10); and
(g)  submit its audited annual accounts to the Bank no later than
five months after the close of the year (para 5.28).
7.05     In addition to the standard conditions of loan effectiveness, TEK
will:
(a) award contracts for all substations related to the Project
(para 3.09); and
(b) engage Project management consultants (para 3.10).
7.06      Subject to the above, the proposed Project would be suitable for a
BariK loan of US$163 million for a term of 17 years, including a 4-year grace
period, to the Borrower, TEK, with the guarantee of the Republic of Turkey.

TURKEY
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT III
Technical Assistance in
Training and Manpower Development
Outline Terms of Reference
1.       The Turkish Electricity Authority (Turkiye Elektrik Kurumu - TEK) is
seeking assistance with manpower development and training. The Project would
include: consultants and training experts; overseas training of trainers; and
equipment for technical training.
A. Consultants
2.       A small team of consultants will support and collaborate closely with
TEK's Training Department and Personnel Department. To ensure adequate
coordination and continuity, the team of consultants are to be provided by a
single agency, competent in electric utility training. The team is expected
to include three full-time members.
3.       The first consultant, who would act as team leader and would spend
about two years in Turkey, will be a specialist in manpower development with
extensive experience in the electric utility industry. He would give special
attention to:
(a)  the strengthening and reorganization of TEK's Training
Department;
(b)  the formulation of a strategic plan for manpower development at
TEK;
(c)  developing an awareness of the importance of training within TEK;
(d)  supervising the work of the other training consultants; and
(e)  providing regular reports to TEK and to the Bank.
4.       The second consultant, who would also spend two years in Turkey,
would be an engineer with experience in training the staff of an electric
utility. Reporting to the team leader, he would give special attention to:
(a) identifying specific training needs within TEK;
(b) developing training curricula and training programs for
instructors;

(c) identifying suitable overseas training programs for the
trainers of trainers and assisting with the development of
their job functions on their return to TEK; and
(d) identifying the needs for equipment and materials, in TEK's
training centers, and assuring that this equipment, to be
financed as part of the Project, is installed and used
successfully in courses for TEK staff.
5.       The third consultant, also reporting to the team leader, would spend
one year in Turkey, arriving after TEK was prepared to launch decentralized
training activities at designated operating units. He would be an engineer
with experience in conducting decentralized training programs for electric
utilities. He would supervise and guide the first series of decentralized
training activities and make recommendations for their improvement.
6.       Additional experts would be on-call for short missions as needed to
support the training program.
B. Overseas Training
7.       At least eight experienced engineers at TEK, who would be designated
as trainers of trainers of TEK staff, would receive training outside of
Turkey. They would need to know a foreign language fluently (preferably
English) or receive intensive language training before participating. They
would represent the following areas of experience: generation (3 people),
transmission (2 people) and distribution (3 people). The training abroad
would be for about eight months, including three months of classroom and
pedagogical training and five months of applied on-the-job training to upgrade
technical skills. It would take place at an electric utility or at
appropriate specialized institutes.
C. Equipment
8.       Equipment will be required to modernize and expand the utilization of
TEK's existing technical training centers. The consultants would assist TEK
in procurement, installation and application of this equipment. A preliminary
list of items follows.

TURKEY
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT III
Assumptions used in Financial Forecasts
General Assumptions
1.        The historical and forecast financial statements show the situation
of TEK as an enterprise generating and selling bulk electricity only, without
consolidation of the eighteen commercial distribution companies which were
being formed in 1983 subsequent to the November, 1982 transfer of distribution
assets to TEK.
2.        The forecasts were made in current prices applying the following
inflation rates:
1983   1984   1985   1986   1987
Local inflation  (x)                       20      17      15      12      12
International inflation  (%)                8    7.5        7       6       6
A weighted average of these inflation rates was applied to capital expendi-
tures. In order not to understate the TL cost of the foreign component of
these expenditures, however, it was further assumed that depreciation of the
Turkish Lira would occur, equivalent to the differential between forecast
local and international inflation rates.
3.        The exchange rate prevailing in January, 1983 (TL 190 = US$1) was
used to convert all foreign debt obligations to Turkish Lira.
Income Statement
4.        Sales of electricity were forecast to increase at a compound rate of
about 10% from 1982 to 1987, derived from the mission's forecasts of capacity
available for electricity generation. Higher generation and correspondingly
faster sales growth are being forecast by TEK's Planning Department.
5.        Tariffs were set to make possible (a) by 1984 a current ratio above
1.0; and Tb) by 1985 adequate internal cash generation to finance 35% of the
investment requirements of both TEK and DSI. For 1983, the 15% increase
effective June 1 and the covenanted 15% increase effective December 1 were
assumed. Because it was assumed that tariffs would automatically be adjusted
to reflect any increases in fuel prices, the forecasts do not reflect fuel
price increases or related tariff adjustments.

ANNEX 5.4

6.       Fuel expenses were projected by applying the average prices paid by
TEK for fuel in the first three months of 1983 to the average specific
consumption rates and the number of kilowatt hours to be generated by each
thermal plant type as shown below. (Fuel expenses could be 10-15% lower than
forecast starting in 1985 if the proposed conversion of 150 MW of capacity
from diesel to natural gas occurs.)
Fuel Prices    Specific Consumption
(TL/ton)         (Tons/GWh)

7.       The cost of purchased power was estimated by applying an average base
price of 5 TL/kWh, increasing at the same rate as TEK's own tariffs, to the
following purchase plan:
Power Purchases (kWh)
1983    1984   1985    1986   1987
Imports:  Bulgaria                          1,200   1,280  1,280   1,280  1,280

Domestic: CEAS                                 73        0       0       0       0
KEPEZ                                0        0       0        0      0
Total                                 1,873   2,000   2,000  2,000  2,000
8.       For wages and salaries, the local inflation index was applied to
increase the 1982 level.  While wage levels may increase at slightly less than
the rate of inflation, the number of staff is likely to expand, so the
increase in total wage expenses may be about the same as the local inflation
rate.

9.       Other expenses, including material other than fuel and miscellaneous
expenses, are assumed to increase at the same rate as unit sales growth, plus
the local inflation rate.
10.      Income taxes are 40% of net income, after all operating expenses and
net interest expense.
Balance Sheet
11.      Additions to work in progress and to fixed assets in service are made
at current prices. However, existing assets in service have not been revalued
in tne forecasts, because of lack of adequate information on age and composi-
tion of assets. In any case, valuation of existing assets does not affect the
financing plan.
12.      Transfers from DSI:  Hydroelectric projects completed by DSI are
added to fixed assets in service without passing through work in progress.
The total value of these assets is transferred to TEK in the forms of equity.
The Bank requested under Loan 1844-TU that the Government consider a change in
accounting procedures, such that at the time when completed hydroelectric
power plants are transferred from DSI to TEK, the asset value is offset by a
combination of both debt and equity. This change in procedures has not yet
occurred, however, and the forecasts assume the current practices will
continue. The forecasts assume transfers of DSI assets valued as follows (in
millions of TL):
1983            1984            1985             1986               1987
5,239          63,500           6,312           44,294           268,671
13.      Accounts receivable are estimated to be 60 days (two months) of
annual electricity sales revenues in 1983 and 1984, improving to 45 days in
1985-87.
14.      Net income each year, after payment of debt service and adding back
depreciation, has been distributed to retained earnings (60%) and reserves
(40.).
15.      The interest rate on new local and foreign borrowings is estimated at
the appropriate inflation rate plus a premium of 10% or 3% for local and
foreign borrowings respectively.
16.      Depreciation of fixed assets is calculated at 2.5% for hydro plants,
4.0% for thermal plants, and 3.11% for transmission lines and related assets

TURKEY
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT III
Technical Assistance in Accounting and Management
Information Systems
Outline Terms of Reference
1.       The Turkish Electricity Authority (Turkiye Electrik Kurumu - TEK)
wishes to engage the services of a consulting group with utility accounting
and computer system experience, including microcomputer applications, data
base concepts and on-line capabilities. The consultants would assist TEK with
improvements in its existing accounting and financial reporting system, and in
the introduction of a management information system. The assistance would be
carried out by a team including expatriate and local experts, which would
report to the Assistant General Manager for Finance and Administration. All
reports will be prepared in Turkish and in English.
Objectives
2.       Phase I, which would focus on TEK's central accounting operations,
would have the following objectives:
(a) To improve existing financial reporting procedures, including
the preparation of monthly balance sheets and income statements
on a timely basis using actual data. This would require all of
TEK's decentralized units to submit accounting data in
standardized formats. The benefits would be reduction of the
delay in finalizing results at the end of the fiscal year, and
providing a complete picture of TEK's financial situation at
more regular intervals.
(b) To introduce the use of microcomputers in a few priority areas
of the Accounting Department (e.g. the Accounts Payable Section,
and the Financial Directorate) where acceleration of the process
of routine data collection and tabulation could yield
significant cost and time savings.
(c) To develop a model using a microcomputer for consolidation of
the accounts of TEK's individual operating units, based on
standardized forms submitted by each unit on a regular basis.
3.       Phase II, which would focus on TEK's regional electricity
distribution enterprises, would have the following objectives:
(a) To upgrade the existing computerized customer billing system in
the Central Anatolia Distribution Enterprise to a total accounts
receivable system, and to develop a plan for transferring this
system to other major billing centers.

Page 2 of 2
(b) To assist with preparation of the general accounts in one major
regional distribution enterprises through the introduction of a
computerized general ledger system, most likely using an
existing software package.
Scope
4.       It is expected that to achieve the objectives mentioned above, a
three-year effort would be included under the TEK Transmission III Project.
Emphasis should be placed on training and working closely with a counterpart
team of TEK staff from the Accounting and Data Processing Departments. Phases
I and II could occur concurrently, but coordination would be required.
Furthermore, assistance with the accounting systems of the distribution
enterprises would need to be coordinated with consultants from Electricite de
France, which was engaged by TEK in 1983 to introduce improvements in
tecnnical standards, administrative procedures and organization of the
distribution enterprises.
Related Components
5.       In conjunction with consulting services, the following would also be
financed under the Project:
(a) Overseas training for TEK staff, including visits to utilities
to see actual management information systems in use.
(b) Computer hardware:
(i) expansion of memory of IBM 370/138 in TEK's Central Data
Processing Department;
(ii) acquisition of 3-4 microcomputers and peripheral
equipment, for TEK's Central Accounting Department;
(iii) replacement of the CPU at the Central Anatolia
Distribution Enterprise, Ankara;
(iv) additional terminals for use in selected distribution
offices.
(c) Computer software:
(i) as needed for microcomputers;
(ii) General Ledger System for use by an electricity
distribution enterprise.
The consultants would assist TEK with the specification and procurement of the
equipment necessary to achieve Project objectives.

ANNEX 6.2
TURKEY
TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT III
Assumptions for the Calculation of Rate of Return
1.  Economic life of the Project:  30 years.
2.  Opportunity cost of capital:   12%.
3. Base year: January 1983.
4. Investment costs in distribution: 20% of total investment program from
1964 onwards.
5. Fuel cost:
- Specific consumption: l200t/GWh for lignite-fired plants.
715t/GWh for coal-fired plants.
- Estimated long-run marginal cost of production (US$/ton):
lignite: 22
coal   : 50
6. Operating and maintenance costs:
- Generation and transmission: 1% of cumulative capital cost.
- Distribution: 2% of cumulative capital cost.
7.  Distribution losses:
1983-1985:  16%
1986-1987:  15%
1988     :  14%
1989     :  13%
1990     :  12%
1991-2004:  10%
8.  Electricity tariffs (TL/kWh):
- at the bulk level  :   9.25 in 1983 and 10.20 from 1984 onwards
(TEK's average tariff)
- at the retail level:  11.25 and 12.20 from 1984 onwards
(estimated retail tariff for Ankara).
These average tariffs are projected on the basis of two Government-stated
inicreases of 15% each, to take place on June 1, 1983 and December 1, 1983,
respectively; and on the assumption that a further 10% real increase would
take place on May 1, 1984 in order to meet the cash generation targets
agreed to under the Karakaya loan. Furthermore it is assumed that no real
decreases over the 1984 level in tariffs take place in 1985 and beyond.
