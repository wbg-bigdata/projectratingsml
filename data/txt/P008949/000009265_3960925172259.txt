PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
THIRD TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2322-TU)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PC') for the Third TEK
Transmission Project in Turkey, for which Loan 2322-TU in the amount of US$163
million was approved on June 23, 1983. After a cancellation of US$65 million
effective April 4, 1988, the remainder of the loan was closed on September 30,
1989, and fully disbursed on January 31, 1990, except for a balance of
US$159,323.68 which was cancelled as of the date of the last disbursement.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy Operations Division, Country
Department I of the Europe, and Central Asia Reeional Office
(Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). Part II of the PCR has been
prepared by the Borrower (Turkish Electricity Authority - TEK).
The findings of this PCR are based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
THIRD TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOA.N 2322-TU)
Evaluation Summary
A loan of US$163 million was made to the Turkish Electricity
Authority (TEK) in 1983 for the development of Turkey's high voltage power
transmission grid.   The project was the fifteenth Bank group operation in
Turkey's power subsector, and was a continuation of the Bank's assistance,
started in 1952, for developing the subsector and increasing utilization of
indigenous resources. The loan was guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
Objectives
The principal objectives of the project were to expand the high-
voltage transmission network to permit utilization of power based on indigenous
resources, and to support reform of TEK in the context of the Government's aim
of SEE reform.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation, originally expected to be completed in 1986,
was not completed until September 1989. While technical problems contributed
to this delay, the most important factors were: (a) TEK's slow and cumbersome
bidding and contracting procedures and its reluctance to use standardized bid
documents; (b) the unsatisfactory local cost funding arrangements; and (c) the
institutional weakness of TEK.   Lack of local currency funds slowed down
transmission line completion, and the situation became worse when one of the
contractors also started to experience financial difficulties. Also, project
management was poor, and liaison between the TEK managers responsible for project
implementation and those responsible for generation planning, construction and
operation was insufficient to prevent the serious power transmission bottleneck
for the new Karakaya hydropower station (6x300 MW), which resulted from the delay
in completion of the Keban-Kangal line from 198' to the fall of 1989. When it
became clear that due to lower than expected pricez for equipment and materials
stemming from the slump in the international market and the use of materials
already in stock, actual disbursements would fall considerably short of the Bank
loan of US$163 million, a sum of US$65 million was cancelled in 1988.
Despite the considerable consulting assistance provided and the
diverse nature of the matters addressed (ranging from development of improved
operating procedures for the distribution enterprises, urban distribution
rehabilitation, load research, tariff design, and demand management, to manpower
planning, training, and development of improved accounting, financial reporting,
billing and management information systems), most of the technical assistance
efforts and studies included in the project have had little or no impact and few
of the consultants' recommendations have been implemented, although the relevant
studies were completed. TEK's involvement in these studies was, for the most
part, unsatisfactory, a symptom both of TEK's lack of commitment to the
institutional objectives of the project and shortage of good quality staff.



- iii -
Results
Of the project's two objectives,  only one was fulfilled.   The
completed physical facilities helped TEK to meet forecast growth in demand,
although subsequent load flow studies showed a need also for a further, southern
transmission line to evacuate power generated at Karakaya, which was included
in the Fourth Transmission Project (Ln.2586-TU).   The technical assistance
objectives of the project, i.e. to improve TEK's organization, staff development,
manpower planning and training, accounting systems, management information system
etc., were not attained.  TEK's financial targets (current ratio target of 1.0,
accounts receivable target of no more than 100 days of electricity sales by
December 31, 1988, and a not internal cash generation target of 35% of public
power sector investments by FY85 and beyond) have also not been met in recent
years. ThuL, the project's institutional goals remain largely unfulfilled.
The estimated 3.5% rate of return on the "time slice" of TEK's
investment program, of which the project was a part, falls short of the 8.4%
estimated at appraisal, mainly because tariffs have been lower than expected at
appraisal. Construction of the transmission lines included in the project has
not had a significant negative environmental impact or resulted in more than
very limited resettlement.
Findings and Lessons
The immediately apparent causes of the problems that beset the
project may be summarized as follows: (i) failure to use standardized bid
documents; (ii) lack of coordinati-n among the TEK departments concerned;
(iii) failure to make efficient use of the engineering consultants for the
management of the project; (iv) lack of local funds; (v) lack of commitment on
the part of TEK's management to the technical assistance objectives of the
project; (vi) absence of a strategic approach in the implementation of the
technical assistance components, i.e., failure to define and attain the short-
term goals in the pursuit of the longer term objectives, such as the development
of the data base needed for the development of a load management program; and
(vii) lack of a strategy for the development and deployment of TEK's human
resources, and for overcoming the problem of freeing TEK's middle managers from
their day-to-day tasks to enable them to devote time to improving the structure
and organization of their jobs.
The more fundamental reasons for these deficiencies, however, must
be sought in the scarcity, in TEK, of appropriately qualified top and middle
managers with the ability and necessary energy and enthusiasm to define and take
charge of the institutional efforts needed to improve the performance of TEK as
a whole and of its administration and financial management in particular. This
in turn may be attributed to TEK's lack of autonomy in establishing its personnel
and financial strategies and, in particular, in recruiting and retaining
qualified managers and staff on a competitive basis. It is unlikely that these
problems can be overcome without partial or total transfer of TEK's activities
to one or several corporations functioning independently from the Government and
in accordance with normal commercial principles, either by spinning off
activities such as TEK's data processing into a commercial company, or by
privatizing TEK altogether and transforming it into a utility functioning
autonomously within a framework of parameters defined by an independent
regulatory authority.



- iv -
The lessons to be learned from this lending operation are that good
quality staff and management cannot be entirely substitt-ed by consu'lting
resources, and that institution building efforts will not be successful unless
the borrower takes charge and there is a firm and continuing commitment on the
part of both the borrower and the Government to the agreed goals.

2.    Background
2.01        At project appraisal in 1983, Turkey had been facing a period of
serious shortages of electricity which had resulted in factory shut downs and
reduced  industrial  output.    With  the Karakaya hydro plant  scheduled  for
completion mid 1986 and other plants also being built as part of the generation
expansion program, it was essential that the construction of the Karakaya and
other transmission lines be started by end 1983 and completed by mid 1986. The
subject project was designed to permit the utilization of the power produced by
Karakaya and other stations through additions tc the transmission network.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.01        The project had two objectives: (i) to permit utilization of the
power produced by Karakaya and other generating stations; and (ii) to continue
the institution building activities initiated under the Bank's previous projects
in the subsector, especially the financial strengthening of TEK.
3.02        The project was part of TEK's then current 1982-1986 development
plan and consisted of the following parts:
(a)   The construction and placing into operation of about 1,500 km
of 380 kV transmission lines, including series capacitors, to
interconnect various power stations to TEK's bulk supply
system; and
(b)   Technical assistance for TEK to:
(i)   address  organizational,   financial,   technical  and
operational problems posed by the recent transfer to
TEK of municipal power distribution assets throughout
Turkey, also through feasibility studies on distribution
rehabilitation and extension;
(ii)  prepare and implement a program of load research, tariff
studies, demand management and energy conservation
leading to optimum utilization of TEK's existing and
future assets;



- 2 -
(iii) start the implementation of a long-term manpower
development and training program; and
(iv)  improve TEK's existing accounting and billing systems
and introduce the first stage of a mianagement information
system.
3.03        The project cost was estimated at US$259.1 million equivalent
(foreign cost of US$178 million equivalent), and the interest during construction
and front-end fee on Bank loan at US$35.5 millioLi equivalent. Therefore, the
total financing required was estimated at US$294.6 million equivalent (foreign
costs of US$213.5 million equivalent).   Funding for the local costs (US$81.1
million), and for the foreign exchange not financed by the Bank (US$50.5
million), was to be provided by foreign cofinancing sources (US$8.8 million) and
by the Government and TEK (US$122.8 million).
4.    Project Design and Org,nization
4.01        Design.  To prepare an adequate design for each new extension of the
380 kV network, including the proposed Project, specific studies were carried
out in the following areas:
(a)   load flows for normal and emergency conditions;
(b)   energization of long lines;
(c)   transient and steady state stability;
(d)   switching surges and dynamic over voltages;
(e)   short circuits;
(f)   mechanical and electrical design; and
(g)   optimum line routing.
4.02        Basic design for the project was on hand, and equipment and materials
were standardized in accordance with criteria established during previous
construction of 380 kV transmission lines in TEK's network.   Following the
mechanical failure of several 380 kV lines caused by ice and wind in 1975-1980,
TEK had revised the mechanical design criteria for 380 kV lines to take into
account the findings of extensive investigations conducted by TEK and
consultants. Specifically the new specifications called for span lengths not
to exceed 500 m, less sagging of center phase conductors, and ACSR conductors
with a ratio of aluminum-to-steel sections of about 8/1.   In addition, all
lattice towers were to have square bases instead of the rectangular bases
previously specified. Other minor modifications had also been included in the
improved design. Rights-of-way had been obtained and bidding documents were to
be issued starting in July 1983. TEK's engineering department was capable of
preparing detailed project design and required only highly specialized outside
technical  assistance  in a few areas.    No  difficulties  were  foreseen  in
maintaining adequate flow of construction drawings to the installation and
erection contractors.
4.03        Organization.   The project organization was based essentially on
that which existed for the works under the earlier Second TEK Transmission
project with improvements for deficiencies during the construction and service
period of the earlier lines.



4.04        At project appraisal, implementation of many of TEK's projects was
held up owing to a shortage of local funds. To ensure the timely availability
of local currency funds, TEK was to establish a TL revolving fund. Two other
measures were taken tu avoid slippages in project implementation. First, there
was an effort to ensure timely completion of related substations. TEK was close
to completing negotiations for several 380 kV substations under turnkey supplier
financed contracts.   To avoi, the possibility of slippages,  the award of
contracts for the substations    ited to the project was a condition of loan
effectiveness.   Second,  TEK    project management capabi±ities were  to be
strengthened  significantly.      The  engagement  of  management  consultants,
satisfactory to the Bank, under terms and conditions also satisfactory to the
Bank, was an additional condition of loan effectiveness. TEK p'lanned to engage
the services of ELTEM-TEK, a private local engineering consulting firm, owned
jointly by TEK, Cukurova, Kepez and other power subsector enterprises.   This
arrangement would be satisfactory, subject to Bank review of the firm's
capabilities. The firm was established by TEK and the other partners in 1982
to attract and retain experienced power industry professionals without being
constrained by the civil service anQ salary regulations applicable to TEK and
other state economic enterprises.   By statute,  the firm was barred from
recruiting civil servants on active duty, but it could tap the private sector.
The firm would also seek technical support from abroad as required.
4.05        Stringing of conductors and shield wires would be carried out as
follows: one-half by local contractors, and the other half by TEK's own crews
(force account). Based on recent TEK experience, no adverse effect on project
cost was anticipated.   TEK and local transmission line contractors had ample
380 kV line construction capability.
4.06        Technical Assistance.  To introduce improvements in the organization
and operating procedures of the 18 electricity distribution enterprises recently
formed by TEK to take over all municipal distribution activities, TEK agreed to
select and appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank no later than December
31, 1983, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. This technical
assistance component was estimated at 170 man-months.
4.07        TEK also agreed to select and employ consultants satisfactory to
t-oe Bank no later than December 31, 1983, under terms and conditions satisfactory
. the Bank, for about 50 man-months to conduct feasibility studies for
rehabilitation and extension of the urban distribution networks. The studies
would be carried out in close coordination with the work of the consultants
referred to in para 4.06 above. The studies would be completed by June 30, 1985,
and the recommendations implemented in consultation with the Bank.
4.08        As the first stage in improving overall system planning, TEK agreed
to select and appoint consultants satisfactory to the Bank no later than December
31, 1983, to undertake a load research, demand management and energy conservation
study, estimated to require about 300 man-months. This would include technical
assistance for carrying out a tariff study aimed at estimating the long-run
marginal costs of supply at the high, medium and low voltage levels.



- 4 -
4.09        To strengthen manpower development at TEK, the project had a training
component under which TEK would engage training consultants to help train both
technical  and  accounting  staff.    Furthermore,  to  improve  accounting  and
management information systems, TEK would engage consultants satisfactory to the
Bank.
5.    Prolect Implementation
5.01        Implementation of the project proceeded more slowly than expected
at appraisal despite the steps taken at the outset to speed up project
implementation (para 4.04). While technical problems contributea to the delays,
the most important factors were: (a) TEK's slow and cumbersome bidding and
contracting procedures and its reluctance to use standardized bid documents; (b)
the unsatisfactory local cost funding arrangements; and (c) the institutional
weakness of TEK.   At the request of the Government which did not want to
immobilize local funds in a revolving fund for the finaLacing of local projecL
costs, the Bank waived the TL revolving fund requirement under the loan (para
4.04). One of the consequences was that lack of local currency funds slowed down
transmission line completion.   The situation became worse when one of the
contractors also started to experience financial difficulties. Also, although
the performance of TEK's engineering consliltants, ELTEM-TEK, who teamed up with
Kennedy and Donkin of the U.K., was very satisfactory, TEK did not take full
advantage of this support, making decisions without prior discussion with the
consultants. More importantly, project management was poor, and liaison between
the TEK managers responsible for project implementation and those responsible
for generation planning, construction and operation was insufficient to prevent
the serious power transmission bottleneck for the new Karakaya hydropower station
(6x300 MW), which resulted from the delay in completion of the Keban-Kangal line
from 1985 to the fall of 1989, and of the Kangal-Kayabasi line from 1986 to the
fall of 1988. When it became clear that due to lower than expected prices for
equipment and materials stemming from the slump in the international market and
the use of materials already in stock, actual disbursements would fall
considerably short of the Bank loan of US$163 million, a sum of US$65 million
was cancelled in 1988.
5.02        For the technical assistance components of the project, very detailed
terms of reference and counterpart staffing arrangements were incorporated in
the consulting contracts at the outset. However, it subsequently became apparent
that TEK's counterpart managers for the different components were, for the most
part unable to comprehend the need for TA and unwilling to use it effectively.
In some areas, such as the development of technical training programs, the Bank's
interventions with TEK's senior management did result in improvements in
counterpart project management, but in other key areas, such as accounting and
financial reporting, they did not.   As a result, although all studies were
completed, few of the recommendations have been implemented and they have had
little or no impact, despite the considerable consulting assistance provided
(paras 9.01 - 9.05) and the diverse nature of the matters addressed (ranging from
development of improved operating procedures for the distribution enterprises,
urban distribution rehabilitation, load research, tariff design, and demand
management, to manpower planning, training, and development of improved



accounting, financial reporting, billing and management information systems).
TEK's involvement in these studies was, for the most part, unsatisfactory, a
symptom both of TEK's lack of commitment to the institutional objectives of the
project and lack of good quality staff.   The training efforts for technical
staff are being pursued under the Fourth TEK Transmission Project (Ln. 2586-
TU), but a formal training and manpower development program has only recently
been finalized, although the Bank conveyed its comments on a draft in February
1988.
6.    Project Results
6.01        Of the project's two objectives,  only one was fulfilled.   The
completed physical facilities helped TEK to meet forecast growth in demand,
although subsequent load flow studies showed a need for a further, southern
transmission line to evacuate power generated at Karakaya, which was included
in the Fourth Transmission Project.   All but one of the transmission lines
(Keban-Kangal) were completed by October 1988, about twenty-two months late.
The Keban-Kangal line was completed only in September 1989. As noted in para
5.02, the technical assistance objectives of the project, i.e. to improve TEK's
organization, staff development, manpower planning and training, accounting
systems, management information system etc., have not been attained.   TEK's
financial targets (current ratio target of 1.0, accounts receivable target of
no more than 100 days of electricity sales by December 31, 1988, and a net
internal cash gerneration target of 35% of public power sector investments by FY85
and beyond) have also not been met in recent years (para 8.02).   Thus, the
project totally failed in its institutional goals.
6.02        The estimated 3.5% rate of return on the "time slice" of TEK's
investment program of which the project was a part falls short of the 8.4%
estimated at appraisal, mainly because tariffs have been lower than expected at
appraisal, but also because of the delay in completing the project.
6.03        Six of the transmission lines constructed under the project are
located in remote and relatively sparsely inhabited areas in the east of Turkey.
Their environmental impact was positive rather than negative in that they led
to a more intensive electrification of the areas concerned reducing use of other
fuels.   In addition, as compensation for rights of way on village land TEK
financed improvements In the social infrastructure (for example the schools) of
the villages iffected. The other four lines, constructed for the transmission
of power generated at a new hydropower station in the south (Oymapinar) and at
three new lignite-fired power plants in the west (Yatagan, Yenikoy, Kemerkoy),
as well as for the expansion of the transmission grid (Bursa-Adapazari line),
are located in scenic and more densely populated areas of Turkey. While these
latter transmission lines had only a limited and relatively insignificant
environmental impact, such as the cutting of restricted rights of way through
forest areas, the lignite-fired power stations which they connect had negative
air quality impacts on a local scale. However, these power stations were not
constructed with Bank participation. Very limited resettlement has resulted from
the construction of the lines due to their location.

7.    Bank Performance
7.01        The Bank closely monitored the progress of the physical and technical
assistance components of the project, and during almost every supervision mission
stressed the need to accelerate the completion of the transmission lines and to
strengthen counterpart staffing and management both for the physical and for the
technical assistance components. It also kept a close watch on the financial
performance of TEK. After a relatively satisfactory performance in 1985 and 1986
(para 8.02), the Bank agreed to waive the covenants until the end of 1987, when
TEK's tariffs and capital were significantly increased and a new general manager,
brought in from the outside, initiated a reorganization of TEK. However, the
increase of TEK's tariffs and capital (which was not paid up until 1989) was soon
eroded by the onset of accelerating inflation, and the attempts to reorganize
TEK had stalled by the time the new general manager left TEK in September 1988.
The question therefore arises as to whether in regard to the project's
institutional objectives the Bank was too ambitious and not sufficiently
realistic during project formulation and appraisal.  A strategy to put power
subsector development back on track, discussed with the Government and TEK in
1989 and 1990, provides for a restructuring program for TEK under a project which
is presently in course of preparation.
8.    Performance of the Borrower and Guarantor
8.01        In retrospect, it is clear that, except during the reorganization
mentioned in para 7.01, there never was sufficient commitment on the part of
TEK's management of the time to the project management improvement and
institution building objectives of the project (which covered much of the same
ground as that covered in predecessor projects).
8.02        Apart from TEK's failure to take charge of the institution building
efforts, TEK and the Government also have not lived up to their commitments in
areas such as tariffs and financial ratios, and the maintenance of sound
accounting principles. In accordance with the agreements under the Karakaya Loan
(1844-TU), TEK's annual internal cash generation was to increase from 20% of
public power sector capital expenditures in 1981 to 35% in 1986. In addition,
to prevent increases in working capital deficits from counting as a positive
element in the cash generation calculation, TEK agreed in 1983 under the Third
Transmission Loan (2322-TU) to maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.0
from December 31, 1984. Following major tariff increases during the period 1982-
84 (during which TEK did not meet the agreed cash generation targets), TEK did
achieve a current ratio of 1.16 in 1984 and a cash generation of 41% in 1985.
Since then, however, as a result, inter alia, of the Government's unwillingness
to raise electricity tariffs sufficiently to cover TEK's financial costs and debt
service requirements, cash generation has fallen from 31% in 1986 to an estimated
-22% in 1989, and the current ratio from 0.96 in 1985 to an estimated 0.50 at
the end of 1989. 1987, 1988 and 1989 were election years (general, municipal
and presidential), and 1988 and 1989 also years of high inflation, which may
explain why it was difficult to keep tariffs in line with the rapidly increasing
costs. As a result, technically, TEK is now insolvent.



8.03        Furthermore, the first audit in 1988 by one of the international
auditing firms, who in recent years have been permitted by the Government to
open offices in Turkey, has revealed major deficiencies in TEK's accounts, such
as receivable balances which are not supported by details explaining by whom the
money is owed. The restructuring program for TEK mentioned at the end of para
7.01 includes measures to address these matters.
9.    Consultants' Services
9.01        In addition to the engineering consultants discussed in para 5.01,
five consulting firms were contracted by TEK for the technical assistance
components of the project: (i) a US power utility (organizational and technical
improvements and training in the distribution enterprises; improved accounting,
financial reporting and billing and collection procedures, development of accrual
based accounting and preparation of financial statements more than once a year;
introduction of a computerized management information system); (ii) an
international accounting firm (definition of a data processing strategy); (iii)
a German firm (development and implementation of a program of load research,
demand management and energy conservation); (iv) a Canadian power utility (design
of manpower development and technical training programs); and (v) a French power
utility (tariff study and feasibility studies for urban distribution extension
and rehabilitation).
9.02        The consultants performed reasonably well in some respects, less so
in others. For example, the US power utility referred to under (i) played an
important role in the introduction of micro-computers in TEK and in the training
of the technical staff of the distribution enterprises, but did not succeed in
getting TEK to accept major improvements in its accounting, financial reporting
and billing procedures.   They adapted a major financial reporting software
package (MSA) to TEK's requirements, but were unable to persuade TEK to use it.
They recommended the acquisition of two mini-computers for TEK's Head Office
Accounting Department, but the Bank, on the advice of its own computer experts,
suggested that this be delayed pending definition of an overall data processing
strategy for TEK. The accounting firm referred to under (ii), which did develop
a very comprehensive data processing strategy, in the Bank's opinion did not make
sufficient allowance for the difficulties of increasing TEK's very limited data
processing staff resources and of improving TEK's inadequate organizational and
management structures.   Their suggestion that these deficiencies could be
compensated by increasing the input of consulting resources (estimated by the
consultants at US$17 million, in addition to the cost of hardware, software and
modems estimated at US$40 million) made it impractical to launch the
implementation of the recommendations.
9.03        The study of load research and demand management by the German firm
referred to under (iii) resulted in not much more than a preliminary report,
based on assumptions rather than an actual data base (which TEK did not
adequately develop), and providing information of a very general nature on demand
management and energy conservation.



-8-
9.04        After  a poor  start,  caused partly  by  requirements  set by  a
counterpart manager who was later replaced by TEK, the Canadian consultants (iv)
succeeded in developing technical training programs for TEK, but implementation
has not been as far-reaching as had been hoped.
9.05        Finally, the French power utility (v) charged with the feasibility
studies for urban distribution extension and rehabilitation did an excellent
job in that area but, because TEK subsequently changed the technical parameters,
these studies have not been implemented, nor has the very comprehensive tariff
study carried out by the same consultants. Their efforts (not financed under
the project) of improving TEK's inventory control and Istanbul meter reading
and billing procedures, on the other hand, were less impressive.
10.   Findings and Lessons
10.01       The immediately apparent causes of the problems that beset the
project may be summarized as follows: (i) failure to use standardized bid
documents; (ii) lack of coordination among the TEK departments concerned;
(iii) failure to make efficient use of the engineering consultants for the
management of the project; (iv) lack of local funds; (v) lack of commitment on
the part of TEK's management to the technical assistance objectives of the
project; (vi) absence of a strategic approach in the implementation of the
technical assistance components, i.e., failure to define and attain the short-
term goals in the pursuit of the longer term objectives, such as the development
of the data base needed for the development of a load management program; and
(vii) lack of a strategy for the development and deployment of TEK's human
resources, and for overcoming the problem of freeing TEK's middle managers from
their day-to-day tasks to enable them to devote time to improving the structure
and organization of their jobs.
10.02       The more fundamental reasons for these deficiencies, however, must
be sought in TEK's lack of appropriately qualified top and middle managers with
the ability and necessary energy and enthusiasm to define and take charge of the
institutional efforts needed to improve the performance of TEK as a whole and
of its administration and financial management in particular. This in turn may
be attributed to TEK's lack of autonomy in establishing its personnel and
financial strategies and, in particular, in recruiting and retaining qualified
managers and staff on a competitive basis. It is unlikely that these problems
can be overcome without partial or total transfer of TEK's activities to one or
several corporations functioning independently from the Government and in
accordance with normal commercial principles, either by spinning off specific
activities such as TEK's data processing into a commercial company, or by
privatizing TEK altogether and transforming it into a utility functioning
autonomously within a framework of parameters defined by an independent
regulatory authority.
10.03       The lessons to be learned from this lending operation are that lack
of good quality staff and management cannot be entirely substituted by consulting
resources, and that institution building efforts will not be successful unless
the borrower takes charge and there is a firm and continuing commitment on the
part of both the borrower and the Government to the agreed goals.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
THIRD TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2322-TU)
PART II
TEK's Comments on the PCR
A.           In project implementation, it is a fact that there were delays in
the completion and putting into operation of the transmission lines when actual
commissioning dates are compared with the original estimates.  Except for the
Keban-Kangal and Kangal-Kayabasi transmission lines, the delays did not have a
great effect on the transmission of energy from the related power plants.  The
Yatagan-Yenikoy,  Yatagan-Izmit  II,  Altinkaya-Kayabasi  and  Karakaya-Keban
transmission lines were completed and put into operation in accordance with the
generation plans of the Yatagan, Yenikoy, Altinkaya and Karakaya power plants
respectively.
The delays in the construction of the Keban-Kangal and Kangal-
Kayabasi transmission lines did not have a direct role in the transmission of
energy from the Karakaya power plant since the 380 kV Keban-Karakaya (East-
West) transmission lines were able to carry the necessary power, but the high
water level in 1985 and lack of the above-mentioned lines put some restrictions
on the generation capacity of the Elbistan power plant of course; with the
completion of the Keban-Kangal and Kangal-Kayabasi transmission lines there was
a more reliable, stable and better transmission system with more capacity.
The major reasons for delay in the construction of the Keban-Kangal
transmission line were lack of coordination between tower manufacturer and the
erection company,  lack of local currency funds from TEK and the   financial
difficulties experienced by the firm responsible for tower erection, while it
was lack of coordination among consortium members for the Kangal-Kayabasi
transmission line.
B.          Although  the Bank may consider  TEK's  bidding and contracting
procedures slow and cumbersome, certain official rules and regulations which are
prevailing in Turkey must be followed by TEK. In the early stages, some problems
were observed in the use of standardized bid documents, especially in the
"Procurement of Works" like construction of transmission lines, but effectiveness
of the relationship between the Bank and the Borrower has increased and it has
been more fruitful towards the end of the Project.
The reasons for the delays in the approval of bidding documents may
be attributed to the following points:
(i)   In the early stages of the Project, there were many changes
on the Bank side of the persons who were responsible for the
implementation of the Project. Therefore, some points which
were approved before were not found to comply with the Bank's
Guidelines later. These facts created lack of coordination,
time losses and administrative problems.
(ii)  Most of these problems were solved after the seminar held in
Ankara for the "Procurement of Goods" but since it was for the
ESAL Loan, it did not help much for this Project. We think



- 10 -
that such seminars should be held more often and especially
of the "Procurement of Works". If possible, such meetings must
be held with each borrower in small groups just at the early
days of project implementation so that each party can
understand the other better.
C.          Local cost funding arrangements had an effect on some of the
transmissior. lines.   Especially, the impact was more on contractors who had
experienced financial weakness during construction works.
New arrangements have been made for the payment of local costs and
this procedure has at least improved the cash flow to the contractors and now
they have a better knowledge about the time of payment and amount of payment.
Another way to solve this problem is to increase the amount of
financing provided by the Bank for local costs in construction works.
D.          We think that liaison between the TEK managers responsible for
project management construction and operation was in accordance with TEK's normal
procedures. In fact, delays due to local cost funding could not be solved by
related departments since it was a general matter existing at TEK at that time.
The necessary coordination was made between the Transmission and Construction
departments for the lines in which TEK was responsible for wire stringing.
E.          Coordination between TEK and the engineering consultant for this
project, ELTEM-TEK who teamed up with Kennedy and Donkin, was satisfactory. In
fact, there was little which could be done by the consultants since the TEK
departments concerned were able to implement the project for transmission lines.
F.          Tariff increases are related to the overall economic situation of
Turkey, but in recent years tariff adjustments are being done in a more effective
manner.
G.          The reorganization which was realized in TEK in 1988 did nct have
a direct influence on the construction of the transmission lines since most of
the lines were completed by that time. As is known by the Bank, studies for
the restructuring of TEK are being continued. '1
H.           Despite certain delays and some deficiencies,  the relationship
between the Bank and TEK during the evolution and implementation of the
transmission phase of the Project has been fruitful and effective.
'/ Para 7.01 of Part I has been changed to clarify this and modify a
sentence objected to by TEK.



- 11 -
I.          The long range objectives of the Training Development component of
the project which was implemented with the help of the Canadian consultants were
to provide TEK with a training approach for the development of human resources
necessary to carry out its current and projected activities and to train
additional staff needed for the planned expansion program. Thus, TEK would be
able to conduct a continuous program of education and training so as to permit
its staff to keep abreast of technological change.
This project component can be considered as fruitful when the outputs
are evaluated.   During the project,  the counterpart TEK personnel has been
trained on the preparation of training programs with a new approach. A pilot
program has been prepared together with the consultants.
After the completion of the Project, new programs have been prepared
by using the same appioach and technique.
The implementation has also been carried out and approximately 2,000
TEK personnel have been trained by using those programs.
There are still more programs on which the work is continuing.

2.01  The issues facing the project at the Issues Paper stage were as follows:
(a)   determination of the loan amount; and
(b)   Internal  cash  generation  targets  and  clarification  of  the
circumstances in which any reduction in net working capital other
than cash would count as ICG funds generated under the project.
2.02 During negotiations, the following changes of substance were agreed.
(a) The loan amount was increased to US$163 million to cover the following
additional foreign expenditures: (i) US$3 million to finance the development of
a management information study for TEK; (ii) US$4 million to finance the
installation of capacitors at the Kayabasi substation; and (iii) US$6 million
to cover a shortfall in cofinancing previously expected from Saudi Arabia and
the EIB.
(b)   Internal Cash Generation.  The Bank dropped its proposal that the
cash generation covenant under the Karakaya project (Ln. 1844-TU) be replaced
by one requiring tariffs to reach the long run marginal costs of electricity over
a period of five years. In the face of opposition from the Turkish delegation,
it was agreed that studies would be undertaken under the project on which a
restructuring of tariffs could be based. During negotiations it was recognized
that the cash generation target under the Karakaya Loan Agreement was not
achieved in 1982, and would not be achieved in 1983, mainly because of: (i)
substantial slippages in the construction program such as for Elbistan; (ii)
abnormally low water levels in the country's hydroelectric reservoirs; and (iii)
delays in tariff increases.   The Turkish delegation clarified that in the
circumstances there would be two tariff increases of 15% each in June 1983 and
November 1983. Thus, it was agreed at negotiations that the increase of June
1, 1983 would be a condition of Board presentation, and the second tariff
increase of 15% would go into effect not later than December 1, 1983. The effect
of the tariff increases would be to raise the 1983 cash generation to about 21%.
On this basis, it was agreed to continue the Karakaya Loan Agreement provisions,
but with revised targets as follows:



- 14 -
Karakaya           Revised
1982                 22%                12%
1983                 25%                21%
1984                 29%                32%
1985 and thereafter 35%                 35%
The Bank also made it clear that on completion of the various studies then
contemplated, and before the end of 1984, the Bank would wish to begin
consultation with GOT and TEK regarding restructuring of power tariffs aimed at
reaching economic pricing of power rates within 5 to 10 years.
3.    Loan Disbursement
Cumulative Estimated and Actual Disbursements
(US$ Million)

The slow disbursements were mainly due to slow procurement and to lower
than expected prices for equipment and materials stemming from the slump in the
international market and the use of materials already in stock. When it became
clear that the actual disbursements would fall considerably short of the loan
amount, a sum of $65 million out of the loan amount was cancelled in 1988. The
Bank's books were kept open through January 31, 1990 to permit disbursements
against commitments already made before the loan closing date.
