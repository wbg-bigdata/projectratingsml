APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        Past levels of access to potable water supply in Syria have been
above average for the Middle East. However, as a result of rural-urban
migration and inadequate investments in supply works during the past six
years, available volumes are no longer sufficient to meet the population
served and large investments in urban water supplies are required in order to
ensure adequate access in the near future. Prior Bank lending in the sector
has been for water supply in the capital city of Damascus where the situation
was most critical. Out of a Credit of US$15.0 million in 1973 (401-SYR),
US$13.0 million is being used to finance an emergency phase of distribution
works which are presently more than 50% completed with construction proceeding
according to contract schedule. Supply works partly financed by a 1976 Bank
loan of US$35.0 million (1241-SYR) are also well underway.
ii.       Aleppo is the principal manufacturing and trading city in northern
Syria. With the expansion of the area served, migration and natural growth,
the population served by Etablissement Public des Eaux d'Alep (EPEA) has
increased by 8.2% per annum during 1970-76 to a total of 1.0 million. Because
of the rapid growth in demand, there has been a severe shortage of water during
the summer months since 1973. This shortage should end with the completion of
ongoing works in 1977, but with expected growth of demand, supply will aga2n
become inadequate by 1981 unless a further expansion of the facilities is
undertaken immediately.
iii.      The objectives of the water supply component of the project are:
(a) to extend the water source and transmission facilities to meet increasing
demands in Aleppo; (b) to reinforce the distribution and thereby improve mini-
mum pressures and reduce risks of pollution within the system; (c) to extend
the supply into fringe areas of the city occupied mainly by urban poor; and
(d) to provide technical assistance to improve the project implementation
and operational capacity of EPEA. The objectives of the other components of
the project are to provide technical assistance for: (a) preparation of
sewerage projects for Aleppo and Lattakia; (b) improving construction sector
planning capabilities in the State Planning Commission; and (c) improving
administration in the public construction enterprises.
iv.       The main elements of the water supply component of the project are
a transmisson line of 220,000 m3/d capacity and associated pumping facilities
to convey water from Lake Assad to Aleppo, treatment plant expansions and
extensions and improvements to the existing trunk distribution system. Con-
struction is scheduled to begin at the end of 1978 and to be substantially
finished by 1981.



- ii -
v.        The estimated project cost is US$116.8 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$58.4 million. A Bank loan of US$50.0 million is
proposed, equivalent to about 43% of the project cost, for a period of 17
years including 3-1/2 years grace. The balance of the financing will be
provided by internal cash generation and by the Government.
vi.       The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic will be the Borrower
of the Bank loan and will onlend US$48.5 million to EPEA. The balance of
the loan of US$1.5 million will be made available to government agencies
to finance the foreign exchange cost of the other components of the project.
EPEA is a semi-autonomous authority responsible for water supply in the Aleppo
area and has been well-managed by an experienced, qualified and efficient
team. During the last few years the management has been overextended because
of lack of staff to operate the facilities and supervise the ongoing construc-
tion of work.
vii.      EPEA has an impressive financial record and has generated a substan-
tial proportion of its investment requirements, but the financial performance
has deteriorated in recent years due to rapid inflation. EPEA implemented
new charges and tariff structure in February and May 1977 which provides an
average revenue equivalent to LS 1.10/m3 (US$0.28/m3) of water supplied. The
new tariff represents an increase of about 100% on the former scale which was
introduced in 1959. EPEA has agreed to implement whichever is the higher of
(i) the present charges; or (ii) rates which will yield revenue sufficient to
finance each year during the period 1978-82 not less than 15%, and beginning
with the year 1983 to finance each year not less than 35%, of the average cost
of investment during each consecutive three-year period. With the completion
of the ongoing works and the proposed project, the net fixed assets are pro-
jected to increase to LS 598.7 million, a twelve-fold increase on 1976.
viii.     Contracts for civil works and equipment estimated to cost more than
US$300,000, to be financed from the proposed Bank loan, will be awarded on the
basis of international bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Other
contracts, not to exceed in aggregate US$5.0 million, will be awarded on the
basis of local competitive procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Domestic preference of 15%, or the customs duty, whichever is lower, will be
allowed to local manufacturers on contracts procured under ICB. The civil
works contracts are expected to be awarded to local contractors.
ix.       The major benefits associated with the provision of a reliable and
safe water supply are health-related and would be partially revealed through
medical cost saving, a general improvement in individual well-being and a cost
saving to or increased productivity of business enterprises. Statistics to
support calculations of such benefits are not available. The average revenue
of LS 1.10/m3 resulting from the new charges introduced in 1977 is equal to the
long term marginal cost of water calculated at a discount rate of 10% which is
estimated to be the opportunity cost of capital in Syria. The rate of return
for the project is 10%.



- iii -
x.        Agreement having been reached on the issues outlined in this report
the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$50.0 million to the Government of
the Syrian Arab Republic for a period of 17 years including 3-1/2-year grace
at current Bank interest rates. US$48.5 million of the loan is to be onlent
to Etablissement Public des Eaux d'Alep (EPEA) on conditions acceptable to the
Bank and the balance of US$1.5 million to be retained by the Government to be
used as follows: U$1.25 million for sewerage studies of Aleppo and Lattakia;
US$0.05 million for technical assistance to the State Planning Commission and
US$0.20 million for technical assistance to public construction enterprises.






APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic has requested a Bank
loan to help finance a project to (a) expand the water supply facilities in
Aleppo, (b) undertake feasibility studies for improving the sewer systems and
constructing sewage treatment plants in Aleppo and Lattakia, and (c) provide
technical assistance to the State Planning Commission and to public construc-
tion enterprises in Syria. The total project is estimated to cost US$116.8
million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$58.4 million. A
Bank loan of US$50.0 million is proposed, equivalent to about 43% of the
project cost, for a period of 17 years including 3-1/2 year grace. The
balance of the financing will be provided by internal cash generation and
by the Government. The Government of the Syrian Arab Republic will be the
Borrower of the Bank loan and will onlend US$48.5 million to Etablissement
Public des Eaux d'Alep (EPEA-Aleppo Water Supply Authority). The balance of
the loan of US$1.5 million will be made available to government agencies to
finance the foreign exchange cost of the other components of the project.
1.02      A Bank identification mission to Aleppo was undertaken in May 1976.
An appraisal mission comprising Messrs. W. Cosgrove, W. Hayden, W. Keilani
and P. Jeffcoate (Consultant) visited Aleppo in November/December 1976. The
Aleppo and Lattakia sewerage feasibility studies and the technical assistance
components of the project were identified by Bank's sector and economic mis-
sions which visited Syria in November/December 1976. This report, based on
information provided by the Government, and EPEA and on the missions' findings,
was written by Messrs. Hayden, Keilani and Jeffcoate.
II. THE SECTOR
A. Background
2.01      The Syrian Arab Republic, situated at the eastern extreme of the
Mediterranean Sea (Map 12699), is about one third the size of France. The
topography is generally mountainous in the western coastal area but, further
east, the main feature is the Euphrates Valley which intersects a flat or
slightly undulating landscape with more mountainous country in the extreme
east. The climate is generally Mediterranean with hot, dry summers and
moderately wet winters, but inland the rainfall is low producing semi-arid
or desert conditions. Syria's population in mid-1975 was 7.4 million and
grew at the rate of 3.3% during the 1960-70 census period. The urban popula-
tion, estimated at 3.4 million, grew at 5% during the same census period and
now comprises about 46% of total population.



B. Water Resources
2.02      Large surface and groundwater resources are available in Syria,
but the distribution is unbalanced. Annual rainfall varies between 500 mm
and 1,000 mm in the coastal and mountain areas, but in the eastern and
southeastern areas, the range is between 50 mm and 500 mm. In spite of the
substantial resources, scarcity of water is a present and growing problem in
some regions, particularly the south-central. The two principal rivers in
Syria, the Euphrates and the Orontes, are utilized for public water supplies.
There are also a number of important aquifers, mainly in the limestone of the
Lebanon and anti-Lebanon mountain ranges, one of which feeds the Figeh Spring
supplying Damascus.
C. Organization
2.03      The Ministry of the Euphrates is responsible for the development and
use of the Euphrates River while the Ministry of Public Works and Hydraulic
Resources is responsible for management and allocation of water resources else-
where. Responsibility for water supply and sewerage in urban and rural areas
is shared by the Ministries of Housing and Utilities (MHU) and that of Local
Government (MLG). MHU is responsible for general guidance and assistance on
technical matters and for project design and construction. MLG has overall
responsibility for the services provided by the municipalities who operate
and maintain the systems.
2.04      Eight major cities in Syria have semi-autonomous water authorities.
Each of the authorities is managed by a board of directors comprising a general
manager, five departmental heads and a representative of the workers. However,
the Government, through MHU, exercises wide control over all important matters
such as tariffs, budget, personnel, salary levels and capital investment. In
February 1974, the Government issued Decree No. 18 (Annex 1) which now governs
all public authorities. This Decree outlines the structure of public authori-
ties and provides general rules for operation and management. The detailed
regulations for each authority are provided in a separate decree. Outside the
major cities, all but the smallest urban centers have water supply distribu-
tion systems managed by units within the municipal administrative structure.
D. Levels of Service
2.05      Treated water is provided by metered house-connection for about 70%
of the population in the eight major cities. The balance of the population
depends upon private wells, a limited number of public taps and water vendors.
The percentage of the population served through house-connections will be
substantially improved when service is extended to the illegal squatters re-
siding outside the existing city boundaries. Service levels for the urban



- 3 -
poor residing within the city limits is generally satisfactory. The propor-
tion of rural population with reasonable access to safe water is estimated by
MHU to have risen from 50% in 1970 to 60% in 1975, a service level clearly
above average in the Middle East.
2.06      Municipal officials estimated that 75% of the dwellings in the major
cities had sewage disposal facilities. All municipal sewerage systems are
combined systems designed as stormwater and wastewater collectors. There are
no sewage treatment plants and most of the networks discharge raw sewage to
rivers, irrigation fields or the sea. Widespread use of polluted streams for
irrigation creates serious health hazards.
E. Sector Planning
2.07      Water demand in the principal cities is projected to outstrip supply
by mid-1980 and projects are underway to expand supply. The Fourth Plan
(1976-80) provides for an investment of about LS 2,476.0 million (US$627.0
million) in the water supply sector; LS 1,552.0 million for the eight public
authorities, LS 14.0 million for other municipalities and LS 910.0 million for
rural areas. About 55% of the proposed investment program is allocated for
the cities of Damascus and Aleppo. The Bank is already assisting the Damascus
project (para 2.11). By its involvement in a project outside Damascus the
Bank is increasing its impact on the development of financial and institutional
policies of the sector. The Aleppo Project is the only other major water
supply included in the Fourth Plan. The Government is placing more emphasis
on improving the quality and safety of the water supplied by providing longer
hours of service, reducing leakages and improving treatment, particularly
disinfection.
2.08      Current Government plans give increasing priority to reduction of
pollution of major water sources. Pollution control studies are currently
being undertaken for the Barada and Orontes Rivers and for the construction of
sewage treatment plants in Damascus, Homs and Hama. These studies are being
partly financed by IDA under Credit 401-SYR. Similar studies are planned for
Aleppo and Lattakia (para 4.09).
2.09      Prior to May 1977, the water authorities and municipalities were
dependent on Government finance for most of their capital investment because
most water supply tariffs had not been increased for about two decades and
consequently, some authorities were not recovering their cash operating
expenses. Substantial tariff increases were implemented in May 1977 which
should improve the financial performance of the sector. No charges are made
for sewerage services.
2.10      A serious constraint on implementing the planned sector program is
the shortage of professional and skilled manpower. Two factors contribute to
this problem; first, the low salary structure in the public sector compared
with the very attractive rewards in the private sector and in neighbouring
Arab countries and secondly, the lack of training programs for water supply



-4-
and sewerage personnel. Financing provided by the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development for the Second Damascus Water Supply Project includes an
amount for consulting services for the establishment of a water supply and
sewerage manpower training center in Syria.
F. Previous Water Supply Projects
2.11      In 1973, IDA agreed to assist in financing a project designed to
supply water to Damascus with a credit (401-SYR) in the amount of US$15.0
million of which US$13.0 million was to be onlent to Etablissement Public des
Eaux de Figeh (EPEF-Damascus Water Supply Authority). In the aftermath of the
1973 events, it became evident that costs would considerably exceed estimates
and IDA agreed to a revision of the project description to utilize the credit
for urgently required distribution works. In June 1973, the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) agreed to lend US$48.0 million
for the remaining distribution works. In April 1976, the Bank agreed to
finance the Damascus supply works needed in order to meet the increased
demand. Bank financing for this project (Loan 1241-SYR) in the amount of
US$35.0 million was supplemented by loans from the Arab Fund (US$41.3 million)
and USAID (US$14.5 million).
2.12      Construction of the distribution works under Credit 401-SYR is pro-
ceeding in accordance with the contract schedule with about 50% of the works
completed to date. As a result of a leak detection and meter maintenance
program being carried out by EPEF, losses and consumption have been reduced
so that the increasing number of consumers can be served with the limited
production available until completion of the new supply works being built
under Loan 1241-SYR. Construction is well underway on the Bank-financed
tunnel which is the major component of the supply works. Of considerable
concern at the moment is a shortage of key personnel, required by EPEF for
project implementation, which has resulted in delays and lack of coordination
with other project components being parallel financed by the Arab Fund and
USAID. This could seriously affect utilization of Bank-financed components
which are proceeding on schedule. EPEF has now decided to advertise in
neighboring Arab countries in order to attract the needed staff. There are
no restrictions on the salary levels paid to expatriates.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Background
3.01      Aleppo is the principal manufacturing and trading city in northern
Syria. The city is strategically located between the Euphrates and the
Mediterranean on the ancient trade route from the Far East. The city is built
around the citadel, at an elevation of some 400 meters above sea level, and
set in a hollow in the hills below the confluence of various small valleys
forming the catchment of the Quwaik River. It enjoys a Mediterranean climate
with an average annual rainfall of 460 mm.



- 5 -
3.02       In prehistoric times the citadel's defensive site and surrounding
agricultural resources gave rise to an early settlement. The city is first
mentioned in recorded history at the beginning of the third millenium B.C.
for its defense against a group of Semitic conquerors. It played an important
part in the many ancient empires that ruled the Middle East and, in 1516,
Aleppo was incorporated in the Ottoman Empire and underwent a remarkable com-
mercial expansion which continued until the end of the 18th century. Some
of the most beautiful monumental covered bazaars in the East are to be found
in Aleppo and date from this period. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire the
city formed part of the French mandate and became an industrial center. This
development continued after independence and the city today is the principal
center for the cotton and other manufacturing industries in Syria.
3.03       The area supplied by EPEA extends beyond the city boundaries and the
population, which was growing annually at 3.3% before 1970, increased after
that year at 8.2% per annum due to boundary extensions, migration and exten-
sions of the supply area to include neighboring villages. The estimated
population in 1976 was 1,027,000 (Annex 2).
B. Water Supply
3.04      Aleppo's source of public water supply is an intake on Lake Assad,
a reservoir on the Euphrates River some 80 km east of the city. When the
dam was built at Tabqa, the original river intake was submerged and a new
intake was built on Lake Assad. The Intake pumps are at some risk because the
pump motors are installed at a level over 15 m below the lake top level and
could be submerged due to some mishap (para 4.08). Since the construction of
Lake Assad the raw water quality has been generally very good although EPEA
states that high turbidities have occurred on rare occasions and there have
also been seasonal algal infestations. The water is pumped to treatment plants
near the source where it is dosed with chemicals, settled, filtered and
chlorinated. After gravity-flow through an 82 km aqueduct to the city, the
water is refiltered, ozonised and repumped to service reservoirs for supply.
The first phase of this system was completed in 1967 and duplication of the
initial scheme, undertaken during recent years, should be fully commissioned
during 1977. A detailed description of the existing works is in Annex 3 and
shown on Maps 12699 and 12722.
3.05      During and since the filling of the reservoir, silt has been depos-
ited to a considerable depth around the Intake rendering the lowest two of the
three Intake gates inoperable. It was foreseen in the original design that
this silting would occur and that, with full utilization of the reservoir for
irrigation, after 15 to 30 years the silt would block the Intake unless cor-
rective measures were taken such as the construction of a barrage or a train-
ing wall. Recent measurements of the depths of silt show that the rate of
silting has subsided in the last twelve months. EPEA has agreed to engage
consultants to carry out detailed studies to determine the extent of the
problem (para 4.08). The Government has agreed to take adequate measures to
prolong the life of the Intake.

3.06      The bulk of the area is served from two groups of service reservoirs
feeding a major ring main around the old city, pressures being maintained by
balancing reservoirs. The extensive high level areas surrounding the old city
are served by a number of separate zones each with its own repumping station
and water tower. In 1975 there were some 650 km of distribution mains of
diameters up to 400 mm and about 110,000 connections serving some 90% of the
population in the area to be supplied, including some outlying villages.
About 100,000 people without a piped supply live in illegal dwellings in the
elevated areas on the outskirts of the city. In November 1976, the Governor
of Aleppo authorized EPEA to provide piped supplies and house-connections to
all these houses and the expansion has already commenced. The service levels
for urban poor residing within the city of Aleppo is very satisfactory.
3.07      Consumption in 1975 was 83 lcd and is expected to increase imme-
diately to 90 lcd when the present constraints are removed in 1977. Supplies
to many parts of the city have been shut off in rotation for long periods each
day thus producing serious health hazards from back-syphoning. This situation
should improve with the completion of the second phase works in 1977, but with
the expected growth of demand, the supply will again become inadequate by 1981.
C. Sewerage
3.08      The Public Works Department of the Municipality of Aleppo is respon-
sible for the operation and administration of the combined sewerage system in
addition to solid waste disposal and roads. No sewerage charges are levied
and the system is financed from the municipal budget which is in turn sub-
sidized by central Government. The system serves approximately 80% of the
municipal population and, of the remainder, 10% rely on septic tanks. Most
of the system was constructed in the last 60 years, but the main interceptors
were built in the 1940's. Surcharging occurs frequently as a result of the
rapid development of the city.
3.09      The municipality has no sewer maintenance program or mechanical
equipment for sewer cleaning and maintenance and consequently the system
is in poor condition. All flow is by gravity into three interceptors which
discharge into the Quwaik River. The outfalls are surrounded by small agri-
cultural plots which utilize the river flow for contact irrigation. During
periods of very low flow, virtually undiluted raw sewage is used for irriga-
tion creating serious health problems which periodically reach epidemic
proportions. Accurate health statistics are difficult to obtain because cases
are not always reported by private practitioners. However, the Aleppo Health
Directorate estimates that in 1972 there were as many as 200 cases of cholera,
3,000 cases of typhoid and 100 cases of poliomyelitis. The number of cases of
water-related diseases for 1975 was: dysentery 185, infectious hepatitis 186,
typhoid 207. In Lattakia, there is a need to relocate the present sewage
outfalls because of a proposed port expansion, and to extend the system to
serve planned tourist and industrial development areas. MHU has begun select-
ing consultants for the feasibility studies and financial assistance for these
studies is included in the project (para 4.09).

=        =
4.04      The cost estimates reflect conditions expected to prevail at June
1977 and are reasonable. The major element of cost is the aqueduct, the
estimated cost of which is based on design and construction methods similar
to those for the previous aqueducts. The project estimates have been based
on current unit costs and the works being constructed by local contractors.
A physical contingency allowance of 15% has been added to cover unforeseen
conditions which may arise during the detailed design and construction period.



- 10 -
4.05      Allowances have been made for future price escalation as follows:
1977     1978      1979      1980     1981
Imported Equipment             8         8        8         7         7
Local Civil Construction    15          12       12        10        10
The price increases for equipment are adequate and in line with the Bank's
recommendations. With the rapid economic developments in Syria and the
political conditions in recent years, there have been exceptionally high
annual increases in local unit prices (20% average for three years 1973-75).
The rate of increase is expected to moderate in view of the Government's
revisions to the Fourth Plan and the price increases that have been allowed
are reasonable.
4.06      During the project construction period, EPEA would also undertake
expansion of the secondary distribution facilities at an estimated cost of
LS 26.0 million.
D. Implementation
Administration
4.07      Project implementation will be carried out by EPEA with the assis-
tance of consultants. To expedite the implementation of the current works,
a project committee, under the Governor of Aleppo, has been established by a
Presidential Decree for a period ending January 1978. The decisions of this
committee on procurement, execution and commissioning are exempted from com-
pliance with all Government regulations, except those relating to salaries
of employees. The Government has agreed to extend the mandate of the com-
mittee to cover the project.
Status of Engineering
4.08      The project has been defined in sufficient detail to enable reason-
able cost estimates to be formulated, but additional studies are required to
ensure that the most appropriate construction techniques are selected for
constructing the individual elements. It is expected that refinements, if
any, would result in lower costs than estimated. EPEA has invited proposals
from engineering consultants to undertake the following works: (a) a review
of the various techniques of constructing the transmission system; (b) a
review of water treatment requirements in the light of changes in water
quality since the construction of Lake Assad; (c) a study of the silt deposi-
tion around the Intake (para 3.05); (d) a study of protection requirements
for the intake pump motors (para 3.04); (e) optimization of proposed dis-
tribution system, and extension into fringe areas; (f) the preparation of
detailed design, specifications and bid documents and bid evaluation and



- 11 -
supervision of construction. A total of 800 man/months of consulting services
is included in this project component reflecting EPEA's difficulty in recruit-
ing staff (para 5.04). EPEA has agreed to select consultants prior to July
31, 1977. A condition of effectiveness is that the consultants have commenced
work on studies (a) to (d) inclusive.
4.09      The Government has requested Bank assistance to undertake feasi-
bility studies for the improvement of sewerage facilities in Aleppo and
Lattakia and US$1.25 million has been included in the loan for this purpose.
Engineering consultants will be appointed by the Government to advise the
MHU and the municipalities on sewage collection, treatment and disposal.
Draft terms of reference are in Annex 6 and involve about 200 man/months
of consulting services.
4.10      The Government has recently established a Directorate of Planning
for Building and Construction within SPC to collect data on the construction
resources in the country. The Directorate will also collect data on construc-
tion costs to enable it to provide a satisfactory basis for price escalation
formula on construction contracts. Lack of appropriate price escalation
clauses is one of the causes of unsatisfactory tenders for Government and
Bank's contract in Syria in recent years. The Government will retain experts
to assist SPC to collect and analyze data on construction and building mate-
rial resources. The Government has also established a number of semi-
autonomous public construction and building companies to carry out a portion
of the country's public development program. The Government will retain
experts to advise the public construction enterprises on cost accounting,
heavy equipment repair and servicing, inventory control and warehousing.
Draft terms of reference are in Annex 7 and involved about 40 man/months
of consulting services. Financial assistance of US$0.25 million, to cover
the foreign exchange cost of the above studies, is included in the proposed
loan.
Procurement
4.11      Contracts for civil works and equipment estimated to cost more than
US$300,000, to be financed from the proposed Bank loan, will be awarded on
the basis of international bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Other contracts, not to exceed in aggregate US$5.0 million will be awarded
on the basis of local competitive procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank.
All major items of equipment and pipes are expected to be imported. Domestic
preference of 15%, or the customs duty, whichever is lower, will be allowed to
local manufacturers on contracts procured under ICB.
4.12      Bidders for civil works contracts are expected to include national
construction enterprises which under their charter, are exempt from normal
supervision by the employer. The Government has agreed that, for a national
construction enterprise to be qualified for the bidding, this provision in
its charter would be waived. In addition under Syrian legislation public
construction enterprises are exempt from posting bid bonds and performance
bonds. Agreement has been reached with the Government that tender calls



- 12 -
will require bidders to state the cost of bid bonds and performance bonds as
separate items and the cost of these will be deducted from the amount of the
tenders when comparing tenders which include those from public enterprises.
Construction Schedule
4.13      The proposed program of planning, design, procurement and construc-
tion is shown in Annex 8. Apart from the supply and installation of addi-
tional Intake pumps and controls towards the end of 1977, the delivery of
materials would begin in the latter part of 1978 and most of the construction
would occur during 1979 and 1980, the project would be substantially completed
in 1981. During negotiations the program was reviewed and an understanding
was reached with EPEA on critical dates.
Land Acquisition
4.14      The land and wayleaves for the aqueduct and other works are already
owned by EPEA and where the mains are to be laid within highway limits, no
wayleaves are required.
Monitoring Criteria
4.15      The project will be monitored by performance and progress indi-
cators which will also be used in EPEA's control operations. A list of key
indicators, shown in Annex 9, was reviewed during negotiations. The Bank
received assurances that EPEA will establish and maintain such statistical
and other systems as may be necessary to produce the agreed indicators and
will report the relevant information to the Bank within three months of the
end of each quarter. Reporting would continue for about five years after
project completion.
E. Disbursements
4.16      The proposed Bank loan of US$50.0 million will be disbursed towards
the cost of the project elements as follows:



- 13 -
(a) Water Supply Component
(i)  Equipment and materials             100% of the C.I.F. cost of directly
(US$25.00 million)                  imported equipment, pipes and mate-
rials, 100% of the ex-factory cost
of locally manufactured equipment,
pipes and materials and 70% of the
cost of locally procured imported
equipment, pipes and materials.
(ii)  Civil Works                         25% of the cost of civil works.
(US$14.10 million)
(iii)  Consultants Services                100% of the foreign exchange cost
(US$3.75 million)                   of consultant's services.
(iv)  Specialized Training                100% of the foreign exchange costs
(US$0.25 million)                   of training for EPEA personnel.
(v)  Unallocated                         For physical contingencies.
(US$5.40 million)
(b)  Aleppo and Lattakia Sewerage Studies   100% of the foreign exchange cost
(US$1.25 million)                        of consultants' services.
(c)  Technical Assistance to Ministry         100% of the foreign exchange cost
of Planning and to Public Con-           of consultants' services.
struction Enterprises
(US$0.25 million)
The estimated schedule of disbursements is in Annex 10. On completion of the
project, any unused balance of the loan would be cancelled if there were no
similar works to which they could be applied.
G. Environmental Impacts
4.17      The volume of water to be withdrawn from the Euphrates is not sig-
nificant relative to total flows. The volume of sewage discharged to the
Quwaik River under the project will be increased but the Government is taking
measures to provide for treatment of this sewage, beginning with studies
financed under the project.

V. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
5.01      Regulations governing the establishment of public authorities and
corporations in Syria were enacted under Government Decree No. 18 of February
1974 (Annex 1). This Decree formalizes the proceedings for establishing
public institutions and lays down general rules regarding the appointment
of directors, the authority and responsibility of the Government and the
Board of Directors and general administrative procedures. Decree No. 18 also
specifies that each authority should be established under a separate decree
that contains specific regulations pertaining to that authority. Accordingly,
Etablissement Public des Eaux d'Alep (EPEA) was established in 1975 by Decree
No. 2410 as a semi-autonomous authority responsible for the water supply
of the city of Aleppo and villages near the transmission pipeline from the
Euphrates River (Annex 1). This Decree supersedes Decree No. 237 of 1947
which established the original Service des Eaux d'Alep.
B. Organization and Management
5.02      EPEA's organization chart is in Annex 11.  As provided by Decree No.
18, control of EPEA is vested in a six-member Board of Directors composed of
the President/Director General, four department managers and one representa-
tive of the workers. The Minister of Housing and Utilities acts as chairman
of the Board when the annual reports are reviewed, and when important issues
are under consideration. In practice, all important decisions must, before
being implemented, be confirmed by a ministerial order issued by the Prime
Minister's office. In addition the Minister of Housing and Utilities must
approve various Board decisions relating to organization of the authority,
procurement and personnel matters. Despite this ministerial control system,
EPEA has a substantial amount of independence in its day-to-day operations.
5.03      The Director General is responsible for the execution of the Board's
decisions and reporting directly to him are five experienced department
managers. The total staff employed is 756 including 16 engineers, 15 other
professional staff, 725 skilled and unskilled workers. EPEA has been well
managed and has competent and experienced operating staff, but specialized
training is required particularly in system design and treatment plant opera-
tion (para 5.09).
5.04      EPEA's annual budget including manpower levels must be approved by
the Government, but the Director General can hire temporary workers, for a
period of less than six months. During the last five years, EPEA was unable
to fill many vacancies due to the low public sector salary levels which are
substantially less than those in the private sector and neighboring Arab
countries. Resignations and transfers of all staff in the public sector must
be approved by the Government and this approval is difficult to obtain. As a



- 15 -
result, EPEA's annual staff turnover is only 1.5%, but morale of the staff is
bound to be affected by this restriction. Assurances were obtained that the
Government will permit EPEA to be adequately staffed at all times with expe-
rienced and qualified personnel.
5.05      The administrative, clerical and design staff are housed in numerous
inadequate office buildings throughout the city with resulting lack of com-
munications and inefficiency. The project provides for the construction of
a new office building for EPEA.
C. Operations
5.06      During recent years EPEA staff has been heavily engaged in the
construction of the second phase supply works. Working under heavy pressure
because of lack of staff, they have managed to install temporary pumps and
treatment facilities and minimize the supply interruptions. Because the staff
has been over-stretched in meeting their primary objective of providing water,
it is understandable that there has been some deficiency in updating records
and forward planning of the new works but, in the circumstances, their perform-
ance has been very good.
D. Accounts
5.07      EPEA's accounts are maintained on a commercial basis.  The classi-
fication and grouping of the accounts are tailored to meet the requirements of
the Syrian Unified Accounting System. An outline of this system was issued in
1974, and details of the accounts for the water supply authorities were estab-
lished by a committee of representatives of the Ministry of Finance and the
Water authorities. This system, which is very detailed, has been satisfac-
torily applied to EPEA's historical accounts. EPEA's accounting staff is com-
petent and the accounts and supplementary statistics, which are kept manually,
are up-to-date. EPEA is in a position to develop a modern management account-
ing and budgetary control system and provision for staff training in this field
is included in the project (para 5.09).
E. Billing and Collection
5.08      The billing and collection of customers' accounts is satisfactory.
All connections are metered and bills are prepared on a two-month cycle. An
effective disconnection system for non-payment is in operation. Domestic ac-
counts receivable at December 31, 1976 represent 2-1/2 months of water sales,
but official department accounts are outstanding for four months. In 1977 the
Government introduced new regulations requiring Government departments to pay
their accounts promptly and EPEA's receivables for official departments have
already been reduced. EPEA billing machines are in need of replacement and
funds are provided in the Bank's loan for machines for billing and accounting
work.



- 16 -
F. Training
5.09      In order to upgrade EPEA's professional staff, training is required
in distribution system analysis, treatment and water quality control, manage-
ment accounting and budgetary control, electronic accounting and management.
At present, there are no suitable facilities for this training in Syria and
provision is made in the Bank loan for external training. EPEA has agreed
to submit a training program to the Bank for comment prior to June 30, 1978.
G. Audit
5.10      EPEA accounts are audited by the Ministry of Finance auditors to en-
sure compliance with Government regulations. The audit for 1975 had not been
started in November 1976, and the final audit certificates for the previous
five years have not yet been issued. In 1977 the Ministry of Finance assigned
an auditor full time to audit the accounts of EPEA. The internal audit unit
is very weak and needs upgrading. EPEA agreed to have its accounts audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to furnish the
auditor's report not later than four months after the end of each year.
H. Insurance
5.11      EPEA has insurance coverage for vehicles.  Private insurance for
third party claims does not exist in the Syrian Arab Republic. EPEA has
agreed to make provisions satisfactory to the Bank for insurance against such
risk and in such amounts as shall be consistent with appropriate practice.
VI. FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Financial Position
6.01      EPEA has an impressive financial record and has generated a substan-
tial proportion of its investment requirements. The total cost of the first
phase project completed in 1967 was LS 67.0 million of which LS 42.0 million
or 63% was provided from internal cash. The cost of the second phase project
to December 1976 was LS 124.0 million; LS 45.0 million or 36% was provided by
EPEA. The deterioration in the financial performance is due to rapid infla-
tion.
6.02      EPEA's income statements, cash flow statements and balance sheets for
the period 1973-76, together with projections of these annual statements for
the period 1977-84, are shown in Annexes 12, 13 and 14. The income statements
show an adverse trend in the operating ratio from 49% in 1973 to about 66% in



- 17 -
1976. This is due to the substantial increase in cash operating costs, mainly
as a result of inflation. In 1976 cash operating costs increased by 53% over
the previous year, while the increase in revenue due to growth in water sales
was only 10%. As a result, the rate of return on average net fixed assets
decreased from 12.7% in 1975 to 7.7% in 1976.
6.03      EPEA's debt/equity ratio increased from 30:70 in 1973 to 49:51 in
1976. This was caused by the increase in borrowing from the Public Debt Fund
(PDF) to finance the second phase supply from the Euphrates, due to be com-
pleted in 1977. At the end of 1976 total PDF loans, EPEA's only long-term
borrowings, amounted to LS 80.0 million. According to the Syrian law, EPEA
should, after meeting operating costs and investment requirements transfer
its cash surplus to the PDF. In practice, EPEA has had no cash surplus in
the past years as all cash generated has been utilized for internal financing.

6.05      EPEA's program of work during the period 1978-82 is estimated to
cost LS 480.2 million (US$121.6 million) of which LS 454.2 million (US$115.0
million) is for the proposed water supply component and LS 26.0 million



- 18 -
(US$6.6 million) for EPEA's expansion of the secondary distribution system
during the project construction period. The proposed Bank loan of US$48.5
million (LS 191.6 million) for the water supply component will provide 85%
of the foreign exchange cost of US$56.9 million or 42% of the project com-
ponent costs.
6.06      The balance of the financial requirement of LS 288.6 million (US$73.1
million) will be provided by internal cash generation of LS 82.0 million and a
Government equity contribution of LS 206.6 million. The Government agreed to
provide EPEA with the balance of its financing requirement including cost
overruns.
C. Tariffs
6.07      Details of the new tariff structure introduced in May 1977 are shown
in Annex 16. Applicants for a new supply are required to purchase in advance
the right to a fixed allowance in perpetuity. Total water allowances for
water right holders represented less than 5% of the total water sales during
the past years. Consumption in excess of the free allowance is charged
at LS 0.60/m3 (US$0.15/m3) for household and LS 0.75/m3 (US$0.19/m3) for
non-household consumption. The new tariffs represents an increase of about
100% on the former scale which was introduced in 1959. Even though there is
no progression in the new tariff, this should not affect the access of poorer
members of the community to the service as the price of water is still low.
6.08      In February 1977, a new scale of fixed charges was introduced which
was estimated to yield about 42% of EPEA's future revenue. The cost of a
connection for a small household ranges from LS 590.0 to LS 790.0 (US$150-200).
However, poorer consumers can arrange with EPEA to pay the major part of
these charges by installments over a four-year period. During negotiations,
EPEA's representative stated that these charges are not a deterrent to lower
income consumers as they have achieved a 100% connection during a recent ex-
pansion of the system into a low income area of illegal dwellings. The Bank
stressed the importance of introducing a progressive tariff structure when
future tariff changes are required.
6.09      To secure a reasonable contribution to capital expansion from
internal cash generation during the project construction period, agreement
was reached that EPEA will set rates at whichever is the higher of the
following two levels:
(i)  rates at a level not below LS 0.60/m3 for metered water sold
for household consumption and LS 0.75/m3 for meter water sold
for non-household consumption; or
(ii)  rates which, together with revenue from other charges, are
adequate to cover operating expenses (excluding depreciation),
debt service and increased working capital, will provide
revenue sufficient to finance each year during the period
1978-82 not less than 15%, and beginning with the year 1983



- 19 -
to finance each year not less than 35%, of the average cost
of investment during each consecutive three-year period
comprising an actual and two forecast years.
According to the financial projections a further rate increase will not be
required until 1982.
D. Future Operations and Financial Position
6.10      The assumptions used in preparation of the financial projections
are in Annex 15. The projected operating expenses, which were LS 14.4 million
in 1976, are expected to double by 1978 and quadruple by 1984. With the com-
pletion of the ongoing works and the proposed project, the net fixed assets
are projected to increase to LS 598.7 million in 1982, a twelve-fold increase
on 1976 level.
6.11      EPEA's rate of return on average net fixed assets is projected to
increase from 7.7% in 1976 to 12.2% in 1977 due to increased tariffs. The
rate of return will be maintained at about 12% during the project construc-
tion period and will decline to 2.9% in 1984 as a result of transferring the
project work to fixed assets. Utilization of the transmission system, the
major element of the project, is projected to increase from 33% in 1983 to
full utilization in 1991. During this eight-year period relatively small
investment in pumps and treatment will be required for full utilization, and
therefore the rate of return should steadily increase.
6.12      The debt equity ratio at the end of 1982 is projected at 41:59.  The
debt service coverage is projected at 1.1 in 1983 rising to 1.2 in 1984. EPEA
agreed not to incur any further loans, without Bank's consent, unless its net
cash generation, before depreciation and interest, exceeds 1.5 times its debt
service in any future year, including debt service on the amount to be borrowed.
VII. JUSTIFICATION
A. Demand
7.01      Aleppo has experienced severe restrictions in supply for the past
three years because of rapidly rising demands and delay in commissioning of
current construction works. Projected future demands require the commissioning
of additional works by 1981 as proposed in the project to avoid reimposition
of supply restrictions. Failure to proceed with the project will restrict
economic development of the Aleppo region. The annual growth in population
of the area served is projected at 3.3%. This rate is conservative when com-
pared with the abnormal 8.2% annual growth during 1970-76 (Annex 2). Because
of the recent supply constraints, per capita consumption is low at about 84



- 20 -
lcd for 1976. Per capita consumption is conservatively projected to in-
crease at 3% a year to reach about 113 lcd in 1984. The project will extend
the water supply system into the fringe areas of the city presently occupied
by an estimated 100,000 urbar poor.
B. Least-Cost Solution
7.02      The only proven major source of water available for Aleppo is from
Lake Assad on the Euphrates River. The project cost estimates are based on the
duplication of existing supply works with staged construction where appropriate
and extensions to the main distribution system. EPEA is engaging engineering
consultants to review the various techniques for constructing the transmission
aqueduct so that bid documents will be based on the least-cost construction
method (para 4.08). Consultants will also assist EPEA in the analysis of the
existing distribution system to optimize the design of the reinforcement and
extensions to outlying areas.
C. Economic Analysis
7.03      There are a variety of benefits associated with the provision of a
reliable and safe water supply the most important of which are health related.
The health benefits would be partially revealed through medical cost saving,
a general improvement in individual well being and a cost saving to, or in-
creased productivity of, business enterprises. Unfortunately, statistics to
support calculations of such benefits are not available. If incremental water
supply revenues from the project at present tariffs are used as a minimal mea-
sure of economic benefits, the project would have an internal economic rate of
return of 10% (Annex 17).
7.04      The problems of measurement of water supply benefits highlight the
need to formulate a tariff policy which reflects the true cost of the service.
If the price of water is fixed at a level which approximates the long-term
marginal cost of supplying the service, economic efficiency will be attained
from a resource allocation point of view.
7.05      The long-term marginal cost of water supply in Aleppo is estimated
to be approximately LS 1.14/m3 at a discount rate of 10% (Annex 17) which is
estimated to be the opportunity cost of capital in Syria. The average revenue
of LS 1.1/m3, resulting from the new charges introduced in 1977, is thus equal
to the long-term marginal cost.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on various issues re-
ferred to in Chapters III to VI of this report, including the following
matters of particular significance:
(a) The Government has agreed to take adequate measures to prolong
the life of the Intake (para 3.05).
(b) EPEA will set:
(i) rates at a level not below LSO.60/m3 for metered water
sold for household consumption and LS 0.75/m3 for
metered water sold for non-household consumption; or
(ii) rates which, together with revenue from other charges,
are adequate to cover operating expenses (excluding
depreciation), debt service and increased working
capital, will provide revenue sufficient to finance
each year during the period 1978-82 not less than 15%,
and beginning with the year 1983 to finance each year
not less than 35%, of the average cost of investment
during each consecutive three-year period comprising
an actual and two forecast years.
8.02      Before the loan is declared effective, consultants shall have
commenced work on a number of studies (para 4.08).
8.03      Agreement having been reached on the issues set forth in this
report, the project is suitable for a Bank loan to the Government of the
Syrian Arab Republic of US$50.0 million for a period of 17 years including
three and a half years of grace at current Bank interest rates. US$48.5
million of the loan to be onlent to Etablissement Public des Eaux d'Alep
(EPEA) and the balance of US$1.5 million to be retained by the Government
for the sewerage studies and technical assistance.

SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
Forecasts of Population, Connections, Consumption and Production
A.   Population
1.        Before 1970 the population served by EPEA was increasing at an
average annual rate of 3.3%, but during the period 1970 to 1976 at the very
high average rate of 8.2% a year (i.e. from 640,000 in 1970 to 1,027,000)
in 1976.  This growth in population served is attributed to the following:
(i) an increase in the population of the city of Aleppo at
a high rate of about 6.2% annually from 640,000 in 1970
(census figure) to 867,000 in 1976 (sample estimate by
the Bureau of Statistics), the increase being due partly
to migration from outlying villages and partly to expan-
sion of city boundaries;
(ii) an expansion in the population served to include residents
of illegal settlements that took place outside the city
limits during the period 1970-76; and
(iii) the supply to certain villages along the transmission line
between the water intake and the city of Aleppo, the total
population of which was estimated in 1976 at 60,000.
2.        A particular example of the migration is shown by the fall in
total population of the villages of Bab and Sephire from 90,000 in 1970 to
30,000 in 1976.
3.        The future rate of growth will depend on population movements
which are influenced by job opportunities.  The Government's new agricultural
schemes and the improvements in social services in the rural areas outside
Aleppo could reduce substantially the future migration to the city. Accord-
ingly, an annual growth of 3.3% for the population served by EPEA, reflecting
only the previous natural growth of population, has been assumed for projec-
tions in the years 1977-2000 (see Attachments I and 2).
B.   Connections
4.        The policy of EPEA has been to provide direct service to as many
consumers as possible and also to provide for a separate metered connection
for each dwelling unit (see Attachment 3). Almost all the properties in the
old city of Aleppo have direct connections, but there are some properties
taking supplies by extensions from neighbors' connections which avoids the



ANNEX 2
Page 2
official connection charges.  To discourage further migration from villages
to the city the population of the illegal settlements, which is at present
served by water vendors, was not connected.
5.        Recently (1976) the Government decided that these settlements
should be provided with all services and EPEA is expected to provide between
1977 and 1981 direct connections wherever feasible or otherwise with public
taps within reasonable distance. The municipality of Aleppo will meet the
cost of water provided from the public taps.
C.   Past Trends of Production and Consumption
6.        During the period 1972-75 domestic consumption averaged 78% of total
water consumed (Attachments 1 and 4). Average per capita water consumption
of 83 lcd was low bearing in mind that 90% of the consumers were connected.
This was mainly due to constraints in the supply resulting from inadequate
production facilities.
7.        During the period 1972-75, peak monthly (and weekly) consumptions
were about 20% higher than the average (Attachment 5). An increased produc-
tion of 25,000 m3/d has been achieved by overloading treatment plant, instal-
ling temporary pumps to enable more water to be taken from Lake Assad and,
additionally, by taking groundwater supplies from private sources which have
now as a result been overpumped.
8.        Water losses during 1972-75 were about 30% of water produced from
Stations II and about 24% of water pumped into the city.
D.   Future Consumption
9.        A permanent additional supply of 90,000 m3/d of water is expected
to be made available in 1977. As a result, the average per capita consumption
is expected to increase gradually from 83 lcd in 1975 to 102 lcd in 1981.
10.       The number per household served by a direct connection is assumed
to decline from 8 persons in 1976 to 6.4 in 1984 and the population directly
connected is projected to increase from 90% of total population in area served
to about 97% during the same period. Average per capita consumption is pro-
jected to reach 113 lcd in 1984 and to continue on an increasing trend to
reach 200 lcd in the year 2000. This figure corresponds closely to that
derived from the assumed trends for average consumption (excluding new
industry) and population based on historic rate.
11.       Industry at present utilizes groundwater from their own wells for
processing purposes and water taken from EPEA is used for domestic purposes
only. A large industrial estate is now nearing completion which will depend
upon EPEA for all water requirements. Industrial consumption, which is now
insignificant, is projected to rise to about 18%o of EPEA's water sales in
1984 (Attachment 1).



ANNEX 2
Page 3
12.       The trend of peak production required to meet summer demands based
on data for the period before 1972 when constraints were imposed, has been
used to determine project design criteria (see Attachments 2 and 5). On
these assumptions the supplies from the second stage works now being com-
missioned appear unlikely to prove adequate after 1980. It is assumed that
constraints will not be necessary in 1981 on the basis that small deficits
can be met either by overloading the works slightly or by introducing ground-
water from private sources which should have recovered yield after resting
during the period 1977 to 1980.

APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
Existing Water Supply Facilities in Aleppo
Background
1.        In ancient times the city of Aleppo depended on local wells and on
the Quwaik River for supplies of water. The first public supply system dates
back to 1914 when, under the Turkish rule, a project was constructed to bring
water to the city, a distance of 10 km from the Hilian Spring. In 1932, to
meet increasing demands additional supplies of water were taken from the
Quwaik River using an intake 3 km outside the city.
General
2.        These sources were abandoned for public supplies when, in 1951,
the Government of Syria began a major project based on abstraction from the
Euphrates River near Aarouda Serhire. The works included a pumped intake
(Station I) delivering to a treatment work at Station II where, after
chemical dosing, sedimentation, filtration and chlorination, the water was
pumped to the head of an aqueduct affording gravity flow some 82 km to
Aleppo. There it discharged to Station III to be refiltered, ozonized and
repumped to the Karm-el-Djabal service reservoir for distribution.
3.        The design output from the scheme is 90,000 m3/d; the treatment
and pumping facilities at each station were provided in three stages each
of 30,000 m3/d capacity. The aqueduct is constructed generally of in-situ
concrete pipe cast in open cut following the contours, but includes sections
in tunnel and also a number of inverted siphons.
Recent Works
4.        During the period 1965 to 1975 a dam was constructed on the
Euphrates at Tabqa forming a reservoir called Lake Assad. The dam controls
the river flow for irrigation and power supplies. The lake, which has a
maximum top water level of 305 m, submerged the water supply Intake and
necessitated the construction of a new Intake.
5.        At the same time, because of increasing demands for water Etablisse-
ment Public des Eaux d'Alep decided to duplicate the original scheme based on
abstraction from the new Intake in Lake Assad. The present intention is to
raise the top water level of Lake Assad sometime at the beginning of the



ANNEX 3
Page 2
next century from 305 m to 325 m and, when this is done, the Station II "Old"
works will be submerged. For the duplicate water supply, Station II "New" has
been constructed above the future level of Lake Assad at an elevation of 336 m.
6.        This duplicate Phase 2 Scheme which was begun in 1971, is still
only partially operative, but should be completed and fully commissioned in
1977. The design output of these Phase 2 works is again 90,000 m3/d. The
second aqueduct delivers to a Station III "New" where the water is refiltered
and ozonized before being repumped to a new service reservoir at Haidarie for
distribution into the low level zone which serves the old central part of the
city. Although the design output of the Phase 2 works is 90,000 m3/d the
capacity of the terminal tunnel leading to Station III "New" is 220,000 m3/d.
Map IBRD 12699 shows the layout of the existing works including the positions
of the new Intake, the Stations II and III and the line of the aqueducts. The
water quality in Lake Assad is normally good except during infrequent algal
infestations or following flood flows.
Intake
7.        The Intake is constructed of a reinforced concrete tower in the form
of two concentric vertical, cylindrical walls, the annular space housing the
pumps all mounted in the base of the tower at an elevation of 285.0 m. The
water passes from the Lake through a rectangular duct into the inner cylin-
drical chamber, flow being controlled by means of three vertical penstocks
each 3 m high to permit choice of level for abstraction varying from the
base level of 282 m to 292 m. The intake duct occupies one segment of the
annulus, the other three segments being reserved for three groups of electric-
ally driven pumps. Two groups installed are as follows:
(a) 4 No. Electric Pumps Rated Capacity each 48,000 m3/d
Static Head 27 m (3 in operation and 1 standby)
delivering at a maximum rate of 143,000 m3/d to
Station II "Old".
(b) 3 No. Electric Pumps Rated Capacity each 54,000 m3/d
Static Head 51 m (2 in operation and 1 standby)
delivering 108,000 m3/d to Station II "New".
8.        The pumping installation includes also the following auxiliary
equipment:
(a) Duplicate Silt Pumps for pumping to waste from the
central intake chamber. Rated Capacity 3,600 m3/d.
(b) Duplicate Drainage Pumps for pumping station drainage.
Rated Capacity 700 m3/d.
(c) Duplicate Fire Pumps. Rated Capacity 1,500 m3/d.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
9.        The silt pumps may be converted to additional drainage pumps by
valve manipulation. The fire pumps are brought into operation automatically
by a smoke sensitive device in the cable room at an upper floor of the
station. The drainage pumps are operated automatically by electric probes.
10.       The main pump-sets are horizontal spindle direct coupled.  Each
draws from the inner intake chamber by independent suction and delivers ver-
tically to a steel delivery bus main buried in the outer wall of the station.
11.       The third segment of the annular space is at present empty, but the
suction and delivery pipework already in place is suitable for installing 3
large vertical spindle electric pump-sets, but with motors only 3 m above pumps.
12.       The control room is at ground floor level at 307 m; the main distri-
bution panel and cable rooms are immediately beneath the control room.
13.       The Intake pumps are at some risk because the pump motors are
installed at a level over 15 m below the lake top level and could become
submerged due to some mishap. The capacity of the drainage pumps is less
than that of the fire pumps and the conversion of the silt pumps for use
as additional drainage pumps would require valve operation by hand at
depth and is therefore of doubtful value.
14.       Another potentially troublesome feature is that silt has already
been deposited in the bed of the Lake around the intake.  In 1964 the Syrian
Government had retained consulting engineers to advise on problems associated
with the proposed reservoir construction including the deposition of silt and
its effect on the pumping of water whether for Aleppo public supply or for
the proposed irrigation works. The consultants considered probable silt
deposition assuming lake levels varying, from top water level of 305 m to
285 m due to seasonal use of the water, and there appeared to be adequate
evidence of silt loadings in the river at that time. Various sites were
considered for the abstraction works for public water supply and the recom-
mendation was that there should be a new intake downstream of the existing
intake.
15.       The project report for the construction of the reservoir, submitted
in 1972 did not appear to pay any regard to the changes in silt deposition
with the variation in lake level. It predicted that silt deposition would
not significantly affect the abstraction of water from the new intake, sited
upstream of the old intake where it has now been constructed, for some 15
years; that the intake could still be used for 30 years by which time it was
proposed that the dam and the lake level would be raised and a new intake
would in any case be required.
16.       The silt is now reported to be some 3 m thick at the intake with
the result that only the upper one of the three intake gates 3 m deep, can
be used. There is no factual information about the incidence of deposition,
when it occurred and whether it is still taking place. It is reported that
the top 1 m is not consolidated and the thickness of deposit cannot be mea-
sured precisely. It is also reported that, when the reservoir was being



ANNEX 3
Page 4
filled, the water level was in range 282 m to 285 m during the April/May
period of maximum silt loading, and that much of the silt was deposited at
that time. The reservoir is not yet used significantly because most of the
major irrigation works have yet to be constructed. At the current rate of
construction of these works, wide variations in level of the reservoir are
unlikely for at least five years and drawdown to 290 m should not occur
before 1990.
17.       It has also been reported that, although lake level have not varied,
high turbidities have been experienced during two periods in the raw water de-
livered to the treatment plant. It is possible that these incidents resulted
before abstraction was confined to the upper intake; otherwise, the high tur-
bidities might be attributable to disturbance of partially settled silt with
unusual currents during high river flows or high winds. Since Lake Assad was
constructed the Keban Dam has been constructed upstream in Turkey and a fur-
ther dam at Karakaya is also proposed. Once these new dams are completed,
the turbidity of the water arriving at Lake Assad is expected to decrease.
Station II "Old"
18.       This station, at an elevation of 309 m, provides for chemical dosing
with aluminum sulphate and lime, clarification, filtration and chlorination.
There are 4 clarifiers and three groups of rapid gravity filters, each of the
latter being designed to act at the rate of 30,000 m3/d. There is an estimated
station loss of 3%, but during the 1976 peak demand periods and with good qual-
ity raw water, the station has been delivering at a maximum rate of 137,000
m3/d (i.e. over 50% higher than the design output). With the low turbidi-
ties experienced since the construction of Lake Assad, there has been little
chemical dosing even during periods of high algal infestation. It is probable
that, during such periods, the settling tanks are not effecting any quality
improvement; also that the algae content could be reduced by chemical coagula-
tion and settlement.
19.       The pumping station contains:
5 No. diesel pump-sets Rated Capacity (each) 24,000 to
29,000 m3/d. Static Head 106 m (4 in operation and 1
standby).
4 No. diesel alternators Rated Output 1,050 Kv providing
water (now standby) for the electric pumps in the Intake
Station and for chemical and other plant operation in
Station 11 "Old".
Two of the pumps and two of the generators were installed in 1953 and are due
for renewal.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
STATION II "New"
20.       This station has been recently established as part of the Phase 2
works at an elevation of 336 m.
The treatment plant comprises:
3 Settling Tanks each designed for a flow of 35,000 m3/d, at 1.75 m/h.
2 Groups of rapid gravity filters each designed for a flow of 48,000
m3/d at 5 m/h.
21.       The pumping station, when completed, will contain:
3 No. Electric pump-sets of Rated Capacity (each) 0.53 m3/s
(45,000 m3/d) Static Head 81 m (2 operating and 1 standby).
4 No. Diesel Alternators of Rated Capacity (each) 1100 Kv
to provide part standby power for the Intake Pumps, the
Station II "New" pumps and auxiliary equipment in case of
failure of the public supply.
22.       The station contains buildings and equipment for dosing the water
with aluminum sulphate, lime and chlorine; also the buildings for storage
of chemicals. In addition there will be administration and control buildings
and houses for operations.
23.       All these works are still under construction, but it is expected
that they will be substantially completed and commissioned during 1977.
STATION III "Old"
24.       At this station the water receives final treatment and is pumped
to the Karm-el-Djabal service reservoir.
The treatment facilities comprise:
2 Groups of rapid gravity filters Total Rated Capacity
1.06 m3/s (90,000 m3/d).
3 Groups of ozonizers Total Rated Capacity 1.06 m3/s
(90,000 m3/d).
25.       There are covered storage tanks for filtered and for ozonized
water. The filters are operated for periods of four or five days between
backwashing; there are no major problems with this final treatment and a
high quality is obtained in the treated water.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
26.       The pumping station contains:
5 No. Diesel pump-sets Rated Capacities (each) 25,000 to 28,000 m3/d.
1 No. Diesel pump-set Rated Capacity 17,000 m3/d.
all to Static Head of 43 m (5 in operation and 1 standby).
3 Diesel Alternators Rated Power (each) 550 Kv which provide
power for ozone and for filter operation.
27.       Initially there were only 4 diesel pump-sets, but there have been
subsequent additions, one in the main Pump House and the second more recently
installed temporarily in an adjacent store building, in order to deal with
increasing demands before Station II "New" is commissioned. Two of the
diesel pump-sets and one of the diesel alternators were installed in 1953
and are due for replacement.
STATION III "New"
28.       This station when completed will contain the following:
2 Groups of rapid gravity sand filters having a combined rated
output of 1.06 m3/s (90,000 m3/d) at 6.25 m/h.
Building and equipment for ozonation up to a rated output
1.06 m3/s (90,000 m3/d).
The Pump House will contain:
3 No. Electric pump-sets each of Rated Capacity 45,000 m3/d.
Static Head about 43 m (2 operating and 1 standby).
2 No. Diesel alternator-sets Rated Capacity (each) 800 Kv
to provide standby power in the event of failure of the
public supply system.
29.       In addition there is one diesel pump-set installed temporarily
in a garage building of capacity about 0.25 m3/s (20,000 m3/d) together
with a temporary chlorination plant which has helped to meet increasing
demands in advance of the commissioning of the main pumping station and
treatment plant.
Pressure Conduits
30.       There are pressure conduits conveying water from the Intake to
Stations II, from Stations II to the Head of the Aqueducts and from Stations
III to the service reservoirs.

32.       Most of these are of recent construction and all are reported in
good condition, not subject to leakages or failures.
Aqueducts
33.       The two existing aqueducts are generally similar in design and
alignment. In most places the route follows the contours, but gradually
falling from an elevation of 411 m to 382 m over a length of about 82 km.
34.       The aqueduct cross-section is egg-shaped, but with a flat invert,
the maximum width being about 1.35 m. The full height is 1.63 m, but the
normal operating depth of water is 1.35 m. The construction is of mass
concrete with nominal reinforcement only.
35.       Most of the length has been constructed in open excavation, but
where the depth of cover exceeded 7 m, construction has normally been in
tunnel the cross-section being very similar. Five valleys have been crossed
with inverted siphons constructed of pre-cast concrete pipes 1.45 m diameter
bedded on weak mass concrete.
36.       There is a washout at the bottom of each siphon which discharges
to the stream. The final length of No. 2 aqueduct in tunnel, delivers to
Station III "New", which adds some 2 km to its length.
37.       Although each aqueduct has a design flow of 90,000 m3/d they may
each, with some difficulty, be operated surcharged when the maximum flow
is increased to 110,000 m3/d. The last 7 km of No. 2 aqueduct (in tunnel)
leading to Station III "New" is of larger cross-section with a design flow
of 220,000 m3/d. There is an estimated leakage loss of 3% in the aqueducts.

Distribution System
38.       Water from the Station III "Old" is pumped to service reservoirs
at Karm-el-Djabal and that from Station III "New" to the Haidarie service
reservoir all situated on the eastern side of the city and having a floor
level of 425.5 m and a Top Water Level of 430.5 m. Details of the reservoirs
are as follows:

39.       The water is distributed from these reservoirs to the low-lying
older part of the city, on the east to all areas below 405 m elevation and
on the west to all areas below about 390 m elevation. In order to maintain
pressures on the western side during periods of peak demand, balancing reser-
voirs have been constructed at Achrafie and Ansari both of which have a floor
level of 413.5 m.
40.       The distribution network for this central zone is based on a ring
main which has been constructed over a period of years and has a diameter
generally of 900 mm, 800 mm and 750 mm, but there are a few sections of
different diameters with a minimum of 650 mm.
41.       In addition there are leading mains of diameters varying from
500 mm to 250 mm running through the center of the old city and similar
spur mains serving some outlying areas of low elevation.
42.       Most of the new developments on the outskirts of the city are on
land at too high an elevation to receive supplies of water from the central
zone. These individual areas are served from a number of water towers each
supplied from pumping stations sited near the reservoirs. There is also a
central area around the Karm-el-Djabal which is supplied in this manner.
43.       Although some of the mains in the center of the city are old, most
of the system has been constructed during the past 25 years, the total length
of distribution mains of all diameters having increased fairly uniformly from
120 km in 1951 to over 650 km in 1975. The mains are generally in good con-
dition; leakages and losses are relatively small. Pressures are acceptable
throughout the area, except during recent months when problems have arisen due
to inadequate water from source to meet the growing demands. In all other



ANNEX 3
Page 9
respects, a good continuous supply has been maintained to all properties served.
The original supply served only the old city, but as the city boundaries have
been extended the distribution system has been expanded to serve the areas
within the enlarged boundaries.
44.       Although the intention is to provide an individual service connec-
tion to each property there have been many illicit extensions from connections
to adjoining properties. There are also many new developing areas within the
area supplied where the houses have been built illegally and where there are
no piped supplies. Water is carted to those areas and stored in individual
cisterns. EPEA have estimated that 100,000 people within the present area
served do not have a piped supply of water.

APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
Description of the Water Supply Component of the Project
Background
1.        This project forms the third phase of a scheme for abstracting water
from the Euphrates River, now Lake Assad, treating and pumping it to Aleppo.
The first phase works provided a supply of 90,000 m3/d and the treatment
facilities were broken down into three stages each of 30,000 m3/d. The second
phase begun in 1971 was initially designed to duplicate these works and again
the treatment facilities were to be broken down into two stages each of 45,000
m3/d. But there were delays in construction and, furthermore, the demands for
water have increased so rapidly that, before the works were completed the two
treatment stages were merged. Also, the decision was taken to increase the
design capacity of the terminal length of tunnel aqueduct into Aleppo from
90,000 m3/d to 220,000 m3/d in anticipation of further increased needs.
2.        Already, before the second phase works are completed, it is fore-
seen that they will be fully utilized by about 1981 and there is urgent need
to proceed with further works to increase the available supply.
3.        Because of the increased rate of growth of demand, and also to meet
new industrial demands, the project comprises works of a capacity designed to
be equal to twice the maximum that could be supplied in each of the first two
phases (i.e. equal to the combined capacity of first two phases working at
their maximum rate).
4.        Furthermore, although the civil works for pumping and treatment will
be designed for full duplication only half the pumps, pumping mains and treat-
ment equipment will be installed and are included in the estimated cost. The
remainder will be installed as the demand increases.
Aqueduct and Pumping Mains
5.        A new aqueduct will be constructed paralleling the two existing
aqueducts. Its design flow capacity will be 220,000 m3/d. There will be
inverted siphons where the valleys are crossed as previously and other sec-
tions which could be in tunnel where the depths of excavation are excessive.
The gravity section could be of concrete with only minimal surface reinforce-
ment as previously or it could be of pre-cast or prestressed concrete con-
struction, the method to be adopted being decided after investigations by



ANNEX 4
Page 2
consulting engineers. If constructed as previously of mass concrete, the
cross-section will be egg-shaped 1.92 m maximum width, 2.30 m high and the
normal water depth about 1.90 m. The inverted siphon sections will be 2.15
m diameter.
6.        The aqueduct will be 75 km long, terminating at the inter-connec-
tion chamber. The supply for industry and adjoining villages, estimated at
30,000 m3/d initially and rising to 50,000 m3/d, will be taken off near this
junction and the total remaining flow will then pass through the two existing
sections of tunnel to Station III "Old" and Station III "New".
7.        Duplicate ductile iron pumping mains 0 1,000 mm from the Intake to
Station II "New" already exist along the Intake approach embankment a distance
of 1.35 km terminating at an interconnecting header pipe which has 6 No. 900
mm flanged outlets. Two of these are occupied by existing 900 mm ductile iron
mains to Station II "New". The project proposal is to lay one additional
1,200 mm ductile iron main 5.2 km long to supply at the rate of 110,000 m3/d
to Station II "New". A further similar main being added in the second stage
works to provide for pumping a total of 220,000 m3/d. Surge pressures are
controlled by existing dual inlet and outlet valves at the Intake and no major
surge problem is foreseen.
8.        The project provides for a similar ductile iron pumping main 1,200
mm diameter 5.5 km long to convey the water from Station II "New" to the head
of the Aqueduct. A second similar main will be laid in the second stage works.
Pumping Stations
9.        The Intake and Intake Pumping Station have been constructed in Lake
Assad with a space left in the structure for the installation of additional
pumps required for the project. Suction and delivering pipeworks have been
installed and tenders had already been called for the pumps before the visit
by the appraisal mission. The proposal is to install 3 No. vertical spindle
direct-coupled electric pump-sets each of capacity 110,000 m3/d delivering
from a minimum level of 282 m to Station II "New" at 336 m; at full load, two
will be operating and one standby. The lake level will normally be at about
300 m and thus the static head will be reduced from 54 m to 36 m and the
estimated total head from 61 m to 43 m.
10.       There may be some difficulty in obtaining pumps which, not only com-
ply with the very precise layout for the suction and delivering pipework but
also have suitable characteristics for efficient operation over widely vary-
ing pressures. The discharge in normal conditions of lake level is likely to
be much more than 110,000 m3/d.
11.       The motors of the new pumps will be some 3 to 4 m above the pumps,
which will greatly improve the present installation where there is some risk
of flooding of the electric pump motors (Annex 3). The installation risks



ANNEX 4
Page 3
will be investigated by consulting engineers and in the detailed design; addi-
tional separately controlled, independently powered high capacity drainage
pumps will be installed and any other measures recommended by the consulting
engineers will be taken for normalizing the protection against flooding.
12.       Since the construction of the dam at Tabqa and the filling of the
reservoir to form Lake Assad, silt has been deposited in the Intake forebay
to a depth of 3 m. In the project report for the dam and reservoir works,
silting was foreseen, but it was not expected to begin to interfere with
abstraction from the Intake for 15 years and the life of the Intake was es-
timated to be 30 years by which time it is intended to raise the dam and
to construct a new intake. Various proposals for extending its life were
considered including a barrier or training wall, but no detailed investiga-
tion was carried out. The early deposition has exceeded estimates, but
this may have been due to the initial filling. The project provides for
consulting engineers to undertake detailed investigations to determine
whether the situation has now stabilized and what additional works, if
any, may have to be undertaken to extend the life of the Intake and
ensure continuous trouble-free operation.
13.       Station II "New" will be expanded by the construction of an addi-
tional pumping station to deliver to the head of the canal. The station will
be of adequate size for plant of rated output 220,000 m3/d. The initial in-
stallation included in the project is for electric pump-sets having an output
of 220,000 m3/d and for standby diesel generators sufficient to permit dis-
charge at half rate during any period of failure of the public power supply.
14.       Station III "New" will be expanded by the construction of an addi-
tional pumping station to deliver to new Service Reservoirs. The station will
be adequate for the installation of pumping plant of rated capacity at least
130,000 m3/d increasing the total output from the station to 220,000 m3/d,
but only half the plant will be installed in the project. Standby diesel
generator sufficient capacity to provide for pumping at 65,000 m3/d will be
installed in the project.
15.       Some of the diesel pump-sets and diesel generators in Station II
"Old" and Station III "Old" date back to the original installation in 1953.
Most of these still function well, but the machines are no longer in produc-
tion and spare parts are very expensive and difficult to obtain. In the
Station II "Old" the plant operates at only 5 Kv whereas the more recent
plant is all 6 Kv. The machines are due for replacement and the project
includes for doing this as soon as possible after the installation of the
new machinery scheduled for 1977. The opportunity will be taken to replace
with 3 Kv plant in Station II "Old." The proposed new plant is as follows:
Station II Old
2 No. Electric pump-sets (operating at 6 Kv)
2 No. Diesel generators each 2000 KVA capacity



ANNEX 4
Page 4
Station III Old
2 No. Electric pump-sets
1 No. Diesel generator of 1400 KVA capacity
16.       The control of flow from the Intake through the pumping stations
to the service reservoirs in Aleppo, particularly the aqueduct flow, is not
a simple matter and demands careful judgement and foresight combined with
long operational experience of the station attendants. The capacity of the
aqueduct is some 300,000 m3, equal to over a day's supply from Station II.
Thus the discharge reacts only very slowly to changes in the rate of pump-
ing at Station II. Although there is very limited storage in the clear water
tanks at Station III "Old", the pumping from Station III must ideally match
the incoming flow and yet it must also be dictated by the demand except
insofar as changes in demand can be met from the storage in the service
reservoirs. Aqueduct flows in excess of demands must be avoided to prevent
overflow and loss of treated water.
17.       The project provides for the transmission of water levels and
flows at the various stations and reservoirs to a central control room by
means of radio and telephone signals. This will be of considerable benefit
in the operations of the supply system and should result in reduction of water
losses and also possibly in labor costs.
Treatment Plant
18.       Additional rapid gravity filters of rated capacity 110,000 m3/d will
be provided for the treatment of the increased flow of water. Plant will be
installed to permit prechlorination of the raw water and this will also afford
final chlorination if required. Provision will be made in the layout for such
further treatment facilities including primary settlement, chemical dosing,
flocculation and settlement, micro-straining or any other treatment which may
be recommended by consulting engineers based on the operating experience of
the existing treatment plants and the plants which have yet to be commissioned.
Distribution Facilities and Service Reservoirs
19.       An allowance has been made for additional large diameter trunk-mains
to distribute the increased supply from Station III "New" but the least-cost
scheme for these new mains has not been finalized. The existing ring main is
inadequate to transfer the water from the east to the west of the city. Most
of the additional water will be required in the high level zones at present
served by a number of water towers; investigations will show whether the new
trunk mains should be laid which will perpetuate such a system or whether it
would not be better to lay a new high level trunk ring main around the north
of the city to serve the high level areas from a new suitably sited service
reservoir. The project has been appraised on the basis that a high level
trunk main 1,200 mm diameter will be laid from Station III to a new service
reservoir to be constructed on high ground at a level of about 450 m near to
the University. Additional spurs 1,000 mm to the north and 900 mm to the



ANNEX 4
Page 5
south will serve developing high level areas. An additional 1,000 mm trunk
main from the existing ring main, to serve developing areas in the low level
zone south-west of the city has also been included. Secondary distribution
facilities not included in the project will be financed from internal cash
generation.
20.       The total capacity of the existing service reservoirs and water
towers is about 160,000 m3. Reservoirs with a total capacity of 100,000 m3
will be added under the project to raise total storage to maximum day demand
(a precaution against the need to shut down the intake during dredging) and
to provide storage in the high pressure zone.
Ancillary Buildings and Equipment
21.       The project provides for replacement of vehicles and for additions
in keeping with the expansion of the supply area and organization.
22.       The various works of this expanding undertaking, many of which
are sited remote from Aleppo, require improved accommodation for the station
attendants. There is provision in the project for the construction of a
number of houses to suit these needs.
23.       The administrative, clerical and design staff are housed in numerous
inadequate buildings throughout the city with resulting lack of communications
and inefficiency. The project provides for the construction of a new office
building to be erected at Station III "New."
24.       Accounts are at present kept manually; the project provides for the
purchase and installation of mechanical accounting, and for staff training
in operation and a budgetary control.

APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
Draft Terms of Reference for Engineering Consultants
for Aleppo Sewerage Study
Introduction
1.        The World Bank water supply and sewerage sector study mission
during November-December 1976 reviewed the critical health aspects of Aleppo
Sewage collection and disposal. The mission agreed with the conclusions of
the Aleppo Health Directorate that the use of untreated sewage for contact
irrigation of vegetable crops contributes to the high incidence of waterborne
and water-related diseases in Aleppo. Cholera epidemics occur on almost an
annual basis. In 1974 the Aleppo Muhafaza reported the highest morbidity
rates for typhoid fever, dysentery, infectious hepatitis and scabies in Syria.
2.        Additionally, large financial losses are incurred by the farmers,
since the crops are destroyed during epidemics. The economic consequences
are further aggravated by the burdens of medical treatment costs and lost
productivity.
3.        Engineering studies are required of possible methods to reduce
the high morbidity rates and to reduce the concomittant financial losses
to the community. Preliminary engineering studies will be developed for
sewage treatment and disposal. Feasibility studies covering the improvement
of the existing sewage collection system will also be prepared with particular
emphasis on combining interception and outfall in addition to the rehabilita-
tion of the system.
Draft Terms of References
4.        The World Bank has been requested to finance the third phase of
the Aleppo water supply which will meet the water demands to about the year
1990 when further source developments are likely to be required. Provision
of additional water to meet the increasing municipal needs will intensify
the problem of wastewater disposal. Therefore, the Ministry of Housing
and Utilities has proposed the appointment of consulting engineers to
undertake the sanitation studies which would be partly financed from the
proceeds of the Bank loan.

ANNEX 15

APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
Assumptions for the Financial Projections
Income Statement
1.        The local inflation rates, used in the projection are as follows:
Year                                 1977   1978   1979   1980 onwards
Local inflation %                     15      12     12         10
2.        Population served, number of connections, water produced and volume
consumed reflect projections in Annex 2.
3.        The new tariff implemented in 1977 is LS 0.60 for household consump-
tion and LS 0.75 for non-household consumption; the average tariff is LS 0.65.
4.        Revenues from metered sales have been calculated by applying aver-
age tariffs to metered volumes. Industry tariffs are based on average tariff
for non-household consumption less an allowance for depreciation in accordance
with the agreement between EPEA and the industrial estate. Industry has
already contributed LS 17.6 million towards the capital cost of present
works.
5.        No increase in the LS 750 average purchase price of a water right
was assumed. All new connections are assumed to purchase water rights.
6.        EPEA, which owns all water meters, increased its annual meter rent
and maintenance charge from LS 3.0 to LS 36.0. The charge for this item is
assumed to be maintained at same level during the projection period.
7.        Other income is projected to increase in proportion to number of
connections plus local inflation.

8.        It is assumed that the staff would increase in line with the in-
crease in number of meters, except for the staff in Stations I and II where
staff is assumed to grow at a lower rate because of elimination of the gen-
eration station and the use of electricity provided by the Syrian Electric
Authority. Also personnel expenditure is assumed to increase by local infla-
tion factors.

9.        Material and maintenance is projected at 1% of gross fixed assets
at the beginning of the year up to the year 1981 and to decrease to 0.5%
after the project goes into operation.
10.       Administration and general expenses are projected to increase in
proportion to the number of consumers plus local inflation.
11.       Present electricity charges are about LS 0.10 kwh in accordance
with an agreement between EPEA and the National Electric and Power Authority.
Future electricity cost is projected to increase in proportion to water pro-
duction plus inflation.
Depreciation
12.       As of 1956 and up to the end of 1975 EPEA was using a schedule of
depreciation rates that was yielding an average depreciation rate of about
3.3% on average gross fixed assets. In June 1976 EPEA's Board of Directors
decided to reduce the depreciation rates, as of the year 1976, so they would
reflect more accurately the actual lives of the assets. The application of
the EPEA's new depreciation rates to different asset components would produce
an average depreciation rate of 2.2%. The mission judges that these rates
are inadequate and do not reflect the obsolescence of assets. Accordingly,
specific rates were assigned, in the appraisal, for the different types of
assets of the project components. These assigned rates produced a weighted
average depreciation rate of about 3.3%. The following table compares the
specific depreciation rates used for the appraisal for major asset components
with those which EPEA is currently using.

Cash Flow
13.       The Bank loan of US$48.5 million is assumed to be onlent for a
period of 18 years including a grace period of 4 1/2 years, at an interest
rate of 8.2%.
14.       The 1977 investment figure of LS 57.8 million under other works
reflects cost required for ongoing works. Of this figure an amount of LS 20
million is already covered by advance payments.
Balance Sheet
15.       Cash requirements are forecast at about four months of cash operating
expenses.

16.       Water accounts receivable are projected at three months of water
sales.
17.       "Accounts receivable others" mainly include installments of water
right sales which are payable within a maximum of four years are projected to
grow in proportion to the annual sales of water right sales.
18.       Following the completion of the present works inventories, which
amounted to LS 20 million in 1976, are assumed to decrease to LS 7 million
in 1977.
19.       The high figure of LS 27.9 million for advance payment in 1976 is
due to two factors; EPEA has paid a 100% advance against letters of credit
to avoid Bank charges and a substantial amount of equipment already on site
for ongoing project had not been transferred to work in progress. EPEA is
assumed to change this payment practice during the project construction
period and accordingly the advance payments figure is projected to decline
substantially in 1977 and stay at about same level thereafter.
20.       Accounts payables are assumed to range at about 15% of construction
requirements during the period 1978-81, then to be at a level of LS 2.0 million
thereafter.
21.       Deposits are assumed to grow in proportion with number of connections.

ANNEX 17
Page 1
APPRAISAL OF
AN ALEPPO WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
Justification
A. Least-Cost Solution
1.        The only proven major source of water available for Aleppo is from
Lake Assad on the Euphrates River. The project cost estimates are based on
the extension of existing works for the conveyance and treatment of water from
Lake Assad to Aleppo.
2.        The project estimates are based on the assumption that the aqueduct
would be of concrete in situ construction. The project has been defined in
sufficient detail so that reasonable cost estimates could be prepared. A
staged construction of the aqueduct was found not to be economical but staging
of equipment and pumping mains was provided for where feasible. Since expan-
sions of the Aleppo supply works after 1990 will supply an area at a higher
elevation requiring a pumped main and/or possibly a different source, a larger
transmission main than the one proposed is not justified. Engineering con-
sultants will be engaged by EPEA to devise alternative distribution schemes
for meeting the future demand and to use a computer model of the system to
select the least-cost solution.
B. Internal Economic Return
3.        The project is expected to be completed by the year 1981 and be
fully utilized by the end of the year 1991. The benefit period covers 30
years after commissioning, a period related to the composite depreciation
rate of 3.3%. Assets added after 1981, mainly pumps, a treatment plant
and distribution lines, are assumed to have a residual value after the end
of the benefit period.
4.        Costs necessary to obtain the full benefits of the project include
the following:
(i) Capital expenditure for the project
(ii) Expansion of the distribution system during the years
1981-91



ANNEX 17
Page 2
(iii) Additional pumps and treatment plant to be installed
during 1986-89.
(iv) Increase in operating costs above the 1980 base year. The
increase in operating cost is assumed constant after 1991.
Costs are at 1976 prices and an allowance of 10% was made for taxes included
in contractors prices. No shadow pricing is employed in the calculation as
the reported unemployment is low, and the exchange rate used for the Syrian
pound is a free market rate which has shown remarkable stability.
5.        There are many benefits associated with the provision of a reliable
and safe water supply, the most important being health related. The proposed
project will ensure that future demands for water can be met thus avoiding
loss of pressure in parts of the distribution system that could result in
back-syphoning. This is the most important in Aleppo in view of the present
inadequate sewage collection and disposal system. The health benefits will
be partially revealed through medical cost savings, a general improvement in
individual well being and a cost saving to, or an increase productivity of,
business enterprises. It is not possible to quantify these benefits, however,
because the recent health statistics showing a prevalence of water-borne
diseases cannot be attributed to the intermittent water supply alone, but
are a combination of inadequate water supply and sewage disposal systems.
6.        Using the new tariff introduced in 1977 as a minimal measure of the
project benefits, the internal economic rate of return on the Project is 9.8%.
The actual rate of return is substantially higher as the additional health and
environmental benefits were not included as they are difficult to quantify.
C. Average Incremental Costs and Proposed
Water Supply Tariffs
7.        The problem of water supply benefit highlights the need to formulate
a water supply tariff policy which reflects the true cost of supplying water
in Aleppo. The object of this would be to ensure that future investment
decisions can be made with greater confidence in their economic merit. If
the price of water supply is fixed at a level which approximates to long
term marginal cost of supplying this service, then it will be demonstrable
that increments in consumption of water are valued by consumers at least as
much as the resources consumed in providing this increment i.e. approximate
economic efficiency will be attained from a resource allocation point of
view.
8.        In estimating the long-term marginal costs of supplying water in
Aleppo, an average incremental cost calculation was carried out on incremental
volume of water to be sold and incremental capital and operating costs associ-
ated with the proposed project for the years 1977 to 2110. The capital costs
which were used in the calculation were those required to utilize the full
potential of the proposed aqueduct and distribute this water. Provision was



ANNEX 17
Page 3
made for the construction of additional filters and for the installation of
additional pumps, ozonation and treatment plant equipment in 1986. No capi-
tal costs associated with the second phase development presently underway
were included in the calculation.
9.        An average incremental cost exercise was carried out using discount
rates of 6, 8 and 10 percent for water sold. The results are summarized as
follows:
Water Supply
Discount Rate                 LS/m3
6                       0.73
8                       0.92
10                       1.14
10.       The current average revenue of LS 1.10/m3 is equal to the long-term
marginal cost of water discounted at a rate of 10% which approximates the
opportunity cost of capital in Syria.
