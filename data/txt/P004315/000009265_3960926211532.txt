SARAWAK POWER PROJECT
I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.1      Over the last 15 years, Malaysia's commercial energy consumption
increased at an average annual rate of 82 from 3.8 million tons of oil equiva-
lent (MKTOE) in 1970 to 13.4 MKTOE in 1986. This was mainly due to growth and
structural changes in the economy. The average annual growth rate of GDP
during this period was 7Z, while the industrial and services sectors expanded
their shares of GDP from 222 and 41S, respectively, in 1970 to 292 and 512 in
1986. A major part of the growth in energy consumption was accounted for by
oil. Until 1983, the share of petroleum in total energy consumption was more
than 90?. With the advent of natural gas production, the share of oil
declined in 1986 to 702. with the remainder comprised of natural gas (20?),
hydropower (8Z) and coal (2?). The share of oil in commercial energy consump-
tion is projected to decline to 62Z in 1990 and 49Z in 1995, while the share
of natural gas is expected to increase to 232 and 38Z, respectively, in those
years. The share of hydropower will reduce from 7Z to 42, while that of coal
will increase to 8? in 1990 and 11? by the end of the century.  The
projections regarding the increasing share of natural gas assume that
appropriate promotional and pricing T)olicies will be in place to encourage gas
utilization in all sectors of the economy.
1.2      Sarawak is the largest state in Malaysia, covering most of the north-
western coast of the island of Borneo. In land area, it is almost as large as
Peninsular Malaysia, yet its population represents less than 10? of the
country's total, and its GNP comprises 8? of the national GNP. The economy is
based on agriculture and mining, including oil and gas development. These two
sectors provided 56? of Sarawak's GNP in 1986, and employed more than half of
the labor force. Although per capita income in Sarawak was 182 lower than the
national average in 1986, it has been growing at a faster rate than that of
any other region--6.12 p.a. during 1980-85 compared to 3.1? for the country as
a whole. Commercial energy consumption has been increasing at an average rate
of 10? from 0.4 MMTOE in 1980 to 0.6 MMTOE in 1986. The share of petroleum in
the State's total energy consumption was 95? in 1980 and declined to 90? in
1986; the share of hydropower increased from 12 to 4? during the same period.
The sectoral distribution of energy consumption has remained stable, with the
residential/commercial sector's use accounting for about 80? while the indus-
trial sector comprises the remaining 20?. However, projections of energy use
for the period 1987-95 indicate that while total energy consumption would grow
at 9? p.a., industrial energy use would grow at 10? p.a., increasing the share
of this sector to 22? by 1995.



B. Eneray Resources
1.3      The principal indigenous sources of energy in Malaysia are crude oil,
natural gas, hydropower and traditional fuels (palm oil wastes, fuelvood and
charcoal). Proven reserves of crude oil are estimated at 3.5 billion barrels.
The production level, which was insignificant before 1967, reached 100,000
barrels/day (b/d) in 1975, increased to about 400,000 b/d in 1983 and 486,000
b/d in 1986. Although Malaysia's crude oil production is sufficient to meet
its domestic demand (presently about 186,000 b/d), the country imports crude
and petroleum products to satisfy about 70S of its need since Malaysia's crude
oil, being light and low in sulphur content, is of high grade and fetches a
premium in the world oil market. Malaysia's net export of petroleum is about
300,000 b/d.
1.4      Malaysia's natural gas reserves are about four times as large as its
oil reserves in terms of thermal equivalence. By the beginning of 1985, 53
trillion cubic feet (tcf) had been discovered--mostly by companies looking for
oil. Natural gas production began on a commercial scale in 1983 at a rate of
314 million cubic feet per day (MHCFD) and is presently about 1,400 MHCFD; of
this about 90Z is fed into a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant located in
Birtulu (in Sarawak), the output of which is sold to Japan. The remaining 1OZ
is used in a combined-cycle power station in Paka, a Trengganu steel mill and
ir. Labuan methanol and hot briquetted iron plants. Future levels of gas
production will be determined mainly by the growth of domestic demand for gas,
both directly and indirectly through the demand for electricity. Present
estimates indicate that production will grow rapidly during the 19908 follow-
ing the commissioning of the Peninsular pipeline and possibility of exports to
Singapore. As market saturation levels are reached, production will grow more
slowly, perhaps reaching a plateau of around 3,200 MMCFD by 2615 for the
Peninsula and a futther 2,000 MMCFD in Sarawak. Reserves in both areas could
sustain such production levels for at least a further 15 years.
1.5      While the country's hydropower resources are assessed at about 27,000
MW (123,000 GWh per year), only about 13S of this is in Peninsular Malaysia
where some 83? of the total population resides and more than 90S of the
electricity is consumed. Present hydro generating capacity in Malaysia is
about 1,300 MW and will reach 1,450 MW with the addition of plants currently
under construction.
1.6      Sarawak has the most abundant energy resources of any Malaysian
state. Its hydroelectric potential has been estimated at 20,000 MW, including
the promising 2,400 MW Bakun site which could be exploited for supply of
energy to Sabah and Peninsular Malaysia as well as Sarawak. Natural gas
reserves are estimated at 24 tcf, of which almost 90? are non-associated, and
an LNG plant has been established at Bintulu to export 6 million tons/year of
gas to Japan. In addition, over 90Z of the land area of Sarawak is covered by
forest which provides plentiful fuelwood to isolated villages.
C. Energy Consumption
1.7      Malaysia's energy consumption, reached 15.6 MMTOE in 1986, of which
about 2.2 MHTOE was supplied from traditional fuels and 13.4 MHTOE from
commercial sources. The agricultural sector consumed about 8? of total energy



- 3 -
in 1986 but its share is forecast to decline to 5? by the year 2000. The
industrial sector consumed about 41? of total energy in 1986, with diesel oil
(51?), fuel oil (25Z), and electricity (242) comprising about 60? of this
consumption and traditional fuels the rest. The industrial sector's share in
total energy consumed is expected to grow to 46? by 1995. The transport
sector accounted for 28? of energy consumption and 45Z of petroleum product
consumption in 1986; its share in total energy consumption is forecast to
decline to 26Z by the end of the century. Residential/commercial users
accounted for 23Z of total energy consumption in 1986. The residential sector
consumed some 60? of this energy, which was comprised of traditional fuels
(36Z), kerosene (39?), electricity (14Z), and LPG (11X). By the end of the
century, the sector's share of energy consumption is expected to decline to
about 18Z, and the structure of demand in the residential sector is expected
to change substantially, with LPG (36?) and electricity (38?) projected to
replace a large portion of traditional fuels.
D. Sector Institutions
1.8      Energy planning and iomplementation is coordinated by a high level
Cabinet Committee on Energy. The Committee, formed in 1980 and consisting of
the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers of Energy, Trade and
Industry, and Science and Technology, is responsible for developing the
country's long-term energy policy, and approving and supervising the implemen-
tation of energy plans and projects. It is supported by a 'Committee of
Energy Officials' chaired by the Chief Secretary to the Government and having
representatives from the Treasury, the Economic Planning Unit (EPU), the
Ministries of Energy, Science and Technology, Trade and Industry, the Nuclear
Energy Unit, the National Electricity Board (NEB) and the National Petroleum
Agency (Petronas).
1.9      Petronas, established in 1974 as a government company, has operating
responsibility for the oil and gas sector. Malaysia's Petroleum Development
Act gives it exclusive rights and interest in petroleum in the country.
Consequently, it supervises work programs for exploration and production, and
negotiates production-sharing agreements with contracting oil companies.
Petronas also has its own exploration activities which are undertaken through
a subsidiary company, Petronas Carigali Berhad, formed in 1978. In addition,
Petronas Gas Sdn. Berhad (PGSB), another subsidiary of Petronas, was created
in 1984 to implement and operate gas utilization projects in Peninsular
Malaysia. 'ts activities include the construction and operation of gas
processing plants, and gas transmission and distribution facilities.
1.10     Power sector development and operations are carried out by the
Ministry of Energy, Telecommunicatior and Posts (HlOE) and the three power
utilities--NEB, the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB), and the Sarawak Electricity
Supply Corporation (SESCO). NEB is responsible for power generation,
transmission and distribution in Peninsular Malaysia, while SEB and SESCO have
the same duties in the two states on the island of Borneo, which lies nearly
700 km east of Peninsular Malaysia.



-4-
E. Sector Strategy
1.11     The Malaysian economy is highly dependent on oil exports both for
foreign exchange earnings and for financing of its public expenditures. In
1985, exports of oil generated about US$3.5 billion in foreign exchange
equivalent to 15.22 of GNP. But the rapid decline of oil prices in early 1986
reduced the oil export revenues to US$2.1 billion in 1986 (9.3Z of GNP).
Because of reduced export earnings from oil as well as other commodities (tin,
palm oil and rubber), the economy faces serious financial constraints.
Furthermore, the country's investment outlays have for the last six years been
far above its national savings, resulting in a very large current-account
deficit that has to be financed through commercial borrowing. The Government
is, therefore, concerned that: (a) domestic use of petroleum would rapidly
absorb the share of exports which would in turn lead to a sharp decline in oil
revenues: (b) investment requirements of capital-intensive and import-
Intensive projects, including those in the energy sector, will impose an
Increasing burden on the public budget; and (c) the widening gaps between
imports and exports, and between investments and savings would increase the
country's debt-service ratio and resource gap beyond acceptable levels. It
has decided to forestall such problems by: (a) more efficient management of
resources; (b) more stringent screening of major investment projects; and
(c) diversiiication and conservation of energy use to release more petroleum
for export.

II. THE POWER SECTOR
A. The Power Market
2.1      Electricity supply in Malaysia grew rapidly in the past two decades.
Total sales and per capita consumption increased from 1,210 GWh and 125 kWh,
respectively, in 1965 to 12,570 GWh and 830 kWh in 1986. The industrial
sector has, since the 1970s, become the major consumer accounting for 432 of
sales in 1986. The commercial (362) and residential (21Z) sectorE cor!ume the
balance. Growth in total demand is projected at about 7Z p.a., much slower
than the average historical rate of 92 p.a. 1/
2.2      SESCO's electricity generation increased from 176 GWh in 1975 to
706 GWh in 1986, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 15Z. The commer-
cial sector is SESCO's major consumer, accounting for about 502 of sales in
1986. Residential (30Z) and industrial (20Z) consumers represent the balance.
Between 1980 and 1985 SESCO was able to increase the proportion of Sarawak's
population with access to electricity from 342 to 49Z. While this is
considerably below the national average of 712, it represents major progress
in a State whose population density is only 12 persons per square kilometer.
With continued household electrification, residential power consumption is
projected to grow at 10.52 p.a., increasing its share to 362 by the year 1995
when the commercial and industrial sectors' shares of electricity use are
expected to reach 36X and 272, respectively. SESCO's major load centers are
Kuching, Sibu, Miri and Bintulu. The first interconnection--between Kuching
and Sibu--will be completed in 1988. The proposed project would bring Bintulu
into the interconnected grid system.
B. Present Generating Capacity
2.3      SESCO's installed generating capacity as of June 1987 was 364 MW,
consisting of 110 MW hydro, 73 MW gas turbine and 181 MW diesel (details are
given in Annex 1).  This includes 108 MW of power from the Batang Ai hydro
plant (4x27 MW, 614 GWh/year) which commenced operation in 1985 and, through a
226 km 275 kV transmission line, provides the energy requirements of the
Kuching load center.  Presently, the energy generation capability of Batang Ai
hydro is more than the demand in Kuching; excess energy will be used to
replace thermal generation at Sibu after a 275 kV transmission line, to be
commissioned by 1988, is constructed from Engkilili to Sibu.
C. SESCO's Development Plan
2.4      SESCO's development plan as of June 1986 was aimed at expanding
SESCO's generating capacity to around 1,300 MW by the year 2000. Except for
some small thermal sets, the program was totally dependent on hydro develop-
ment. The Bakun project with a commissioning schedule of 1995-98 constituted
the cornerstone of the program. In its review of SESCO's development plan,
1/ During the preparation of a recent Bank study of Malaysia's power
sector (para. 2.6), Bank staff and the utilities jointly developed new
load forecasts based on an analysis of sectoral patterns of electricity
consumption. The growth rate of 72 for the power sector and 92 for
SESCO emerged from this exercise.



-6-
the Bank's sector study (para. 2.6) concluded that SESCO should postpone
construction of its hydroprojects and rely on gas-based combined-cycle units
to meet the future growth in power demand. Accordingly, a least-cost
expansion plan was developed which includes 4x45 MW and 2x90 MW combined-cycle
units, and 2x60 MW gas turbines for commissioning during 1992 to 2002. The
program assumes that SESCO's major load centers will be interconnected by
1992. Annex 2 presents the forecast of SESCO's electricity sales, generation,
peak demand and installed capacity up to 1995. Forecasts of electricity
demand by consumer category are shown in Annex 3, and Annex 4 gives details of
SESCO's transmission and distribution facilities.
D. Sector Strategy and Rationale for Bank Participation
Power Sector Strategy and Issues
2.5      While preparing the Fifth Development Plan in 1984-85, the Government
decided to follow a diversification strategy in the energy sector through a
'Four Fuel Policy," which would base future development on a mixture of oil,
gas, hydro and coal. This strategy was then translated into plans to:
(a) construct the 2,400 MW Bakun hydroelectric project costing about US$6
billion starting in 1987 and becoming operatio-nal by 1995-96; (b) utilize
imported coal to supply part of the energy requirements of the indistrial
sector and to fuel 1,200 MW of new power plants at Port Klang; and (c) develop
gas resources for power as well as industrial/commercial use by the early
1990s. In 1986 the EPU agreed that the Bank undertake a comprehensive review
of the Malaysian power sector and its three main institutions, NEB, SESCO and
SEB. The review focused particularly on the issues of gas utilization in the
power sector, and the technical, economic and financial viability of the Bakun
project. The findings of this review were discussed with the concerned
entities in January 1987, and a report entitled Malaysia: Power Sector Issues
and Options (Report No. 6466-MA), was released in April 1987. The sector
study concluded that: (a) the economic cost of gas production/transmission is
about US$1.32/mcf, which is substantially lower than figures assumed in
earlier planning studies; (b) in view of the availability of such low-cost
gas, neither the Bakun hydro project nor power plants burning imported coal
would be economically viable at this stage; and (c) the least-cost solution to
power development during the next 15 years would be to rely principally on the
addition of gas-based generation. The sector study also made recommendations
on pricing of gas to the power sector. The Government and concerned entities
accepted these recommendations and decided to postpone the Bakun project and
cancel the plan for the addition of 600-MW coal-fired units at Port Klang.
The recommended gas pricing policy was also used as input into a pricing
proposal which was approved by the Cabinet. The development plans of the
three utilities, NEB, SESCO and SEB, were reoriented from hydro and coal
generation to gas-fired generation primarily based on a high efficiency
combined-cycle operation. SESCO has been particularly receptive to the
recommendations of the sector study, and its response to the issues
highlighted in the study is summarized below.
2.6      System Planning lechniques and Design Capabilities.  The sector study
recommended that SESCO: (a) strengthen its planning capability by acquiring a
simulation/optimization package suitable for evaluating the economics of
thermal power plants; and (b) modify its load forecasting methodology to rely



more heavily on sectoral patterns and analysis of electricity demand. SESCO
has now acquired the WASP III package and is in the process of modifying its
load forecasting methodology. Through the proposee project, the Bank would
support further upgrading of SESCO's planning and design capabilities.
2.7      Development Program.  The sector study reviewed SESCO's development
plan within the framework of least-cost analysis for the entire Malaysian
power sector and recommended that GOM and SESCO: (a) postpone the
construction of the Bakun project; (b) defer implementation of the Ulu Ai
hydro project; (c) construct gas-based combined cycle units in Bintulu;
(d) interconnect Sarawak's major load centers by constructing a transmission
line from Sibu to Bintulu; and (e) carry out a study on gas utilization for
power in Sarawak and Sabah. SESCO has in principle agreed with all of the
above recommendations and is planning to utilize Bank assistance to implement
items (c), (d) and (e).
2.8      Resource Utilization.  The sector study recommended that SESCO
should: (a) improve its tariff structure; (b) review the contents of its
stocks and seek ways to reduce the level of inventories; (c) identify the
sources and magnitude of transmission and distribution losses; and (d) examine
the efficiency of using modern materials and construction techniques in its
distribution system. SESCO completed a tariff study in 1987 and terms of
reference have been prepared to study SESCO's institutional performance
including items (b) to (d).
2.9      Gas Pricing.  A long-term agreement between SESCO and Petronas on
pricing of natural gas is an essential prerequisite for development of gas-
based generation capacity in Sarawak. The sector study recommended that a
price of M$2.70/MMBTU would cover the incremental economic cost of gas produc-
tion in Sarawak. SESCO and Petronas have agreed on this price which would be
fixed until the end of 1996. The price escalation factor for the period
beyond 1996 is presently being discussed. At negotiations understandings were
reached that the basic gas contract will be ;inalized by October 1988 prior to
SESCO's entering into commitments for purchase of equipment for the power
plant and that GOM would ensure that sufficient gas at a reasonable price
would be available for the proposed plant.
Experience with Past Loans
2.10     The Bank has made twelve loans to Malaysia's power sector, all to NEB
which supplies the Peninsula. The first nine projects have been completed and
are operating satisfactorily. The tenth (Rural Electrification) and eleventh
power projects are currently under implementation and are expected to be
completed by December 1988 and June 1989, respectively. Implementation of the
twelfth project (Energy Efficiency and Plant Rehabilitation) commenced in
January 1987. The Project Completion Report for the eighth power project
(Loan 1443-MA) noted the impressive financial and institutional progress made
by NEB although it also pointed out certain areas such as improvement in
operation of thermal/hydro plants and distribution system planning where
strengthening was required. The report also pointed out the need for reducing
staffing in the non-technical cadres. The Bank's participation in the sector
has helped NEB to develop into a technically competent and efficient power
utility. Through its continuing dialogue with the sector institutions, the



Bank has been instrumental in assuring the overall adequacy of electricity
tariffs and in ensuring the sector's financial soundness. The Bank has also
financed and supervised a study on tariffs for consideration by the Government
while introducing tariff changes in 1985. The Bank has not made any loans to
SESCO or SEB.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.11     Halaysia's entire power sector will be oriented towards utilizing
natural gas for power generation. A major challenge in this transition is the
strengthening of the coordination role of the various government agencies and
the initiation of a dialogue between the gas and power sectors to ensure
efficient allocation of resources. The Bank's input has been and will be
essential to: (a) assist the core entities such as EPU, MOE and the Federal
Treasury to play the needed coordinating role; and (b) assist the dialogue
between the gas and the power entities on major issues such as pricing of gas
and timing of gas generation and transmission projects. In addition, this
project arising directly from the sector study places the Bank in a unique
position to influence dialogue between the concerned parties and will assist
in strengthening the institutional capabilities of SESCO and improving its
operational efficiency.

III. THE BORROWER
A. Introduction
3.1      The borrower of the proposed loan will be SESCO, a statutory corpora-
tion established under the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation Ordinance of
1962. SESCO is owned wholly by the State Government of Sarawak and comes
under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Infrastructure Development. It
operates under a licence granted to its predecessor, Sarawak Electricity
Supply Company Limited, which SESCO inherited on the dissolution of that
company in 1962. SESCO has responsibility for genierating, transmitting and
distributing electricity throughout the State.
3.2      SESCO's management enjoys broad autonomy in managing its day-to-day
affairs in such important matters as deployment of sta£ , determination of
staff remuneration, planning, contracting and financing of investments. It
follows the procedures and guidelines issued by the Government of Malaysia
(GOM) and the State Government.
3.3      Energy is a federal subject in Malaysia.  The NEB is owned by GOM
which also took over the ownership of SEB in 1981 from the State Government of
Sabah. SESCO is the only remaining electricity utility still under state
government ownership. GOM intends to take over SESCO and establish it as a
corporation under the Federal Government, and for that purpose has passed an
Act--the Perbadanan Pembekalan Letrik Sarawak Act of 1983. The Act has not,
however, been declared effective because of certain issues which are still to
be resolved. However, the transfer of SESCO's ownership from the State
Government to GOM should not affect its operations since the 1983 legislation
is, in all essential aspects, similar to SESCO's ordinance of 1962.
B. Oraanization
Structure
3.4      SESCO's operational and policy decisions are made by its Board, which
consists of a Chairman, a Deputy Chairman and seven other members, including
five nonofficial members all appointed by the State Government on the advice
of the Minister of Infrastructure Development. SESCO's General Manager (GM)
is its Chief Executive Officer, and although not a member of the Board, he
influences the Board's decisions and provides basic input. He is responsible
for implementing the Board's decisions and for day-to-day management of the
Corporation.
3.5      SESCO's organization is shown in Chart 1.  Its operations are divided
into five main departments--Operations; Design and Construction; Development
Planning; Finance; and Administration and Personnel. The heads of these
departments report directly to the GM.
3.6      SESCO's field operations are organized into five regional offices--
Western, Sri Aman, Central, Bintulu and Nortnern--which control 80 field
stations. These stations are responsible for operation and maintenance of



- 10 -
generating facilities, erection and maintenance of distribution lines, hand-
ling of commercial operations and maintenance of accounts. All remaining
operational responsibilities are centralized and performed at headquarters.
3.7      Though. SESCO is well organized, certain weaknesses in its operations
indicate a need for (a) reducing transmission and distribution losses; (b) re-
ducing the cost of distribution system construction by use of modern materials
and construction techniques; and (c) inventory control (para. 2.9). These
aspects will be reviewed by SESCO with the assistance of consultants financed
by a grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The ADB-financed consul-
tants will also review SESCO's current organizational structure and recommend
any changes needed to meet its expanded operational requirements in the 1990s.
3.8      Currently, SESCO has no office procedures manual nor have the duties
and functions of various officers been clearly defined. Some of these matters
are contained in office memos, circulars and establishment orders issued
periodically, but these are scattered and incomplete. SESCO recognizes the
urgent need for a comprehensive manual to cover these subjects and provision
has been made in the proposed project for employment of a consultant to under-
take this task (para. 4.2).
Management
3.9      SESCO is a well managed electric power utility.  The GM is a quali-
fied engineer and a successful administrator who has held his current office
for about 12 years. He is assisted by a team of highly qualified and
experienced staff.
3.10     SESCO's establishment and staffing in 1984-87 are given in Table 3.1
below:

3.11     Tn line with GOM's policy of privatization, SESCO has recently
entrusted construction of service lines and cable laying to private contrac-
tors.  Accordingly, it has been able to reduce its approved staffing level
from 1,895 in 1986 to 1,826 in 1987--a decrease of about 4Z.  In addition,
about 9Z of approved positions for supervisors, technicians and unskilled
laborers have been kept vacant. SESCO's fill rate has been about 922 to 942
in the last three years.
3.12     Of the total staff of 1,691 as on June 1, 1987, 480 (28Z) were
employed at headquarters and 1,211 (722) in the field. Excluding unskilled
laborers, about 132 of the staff are degree holders, 72 possess diplomas in
engineering or accounting, 62Z are technicians and 18Z high school graduates.
3.13     The ratio of consumers to employees at the end of 1986 was 80:1, up
from 55:1 in 1975, 64:1 in 1980 and 74:1 in 1984. Electricity sales per
employee have increased from about 176,000 kWh in 1975 to 266,000 kWh in 1980
and are presently estimated at 340,000 kWh. In contrast, NEB's current
consumer/employee ratio is about 84:1 and sales per employee are about 430,000
kWh. However, because of population density and income differences in the
SESCO and NEB service areas, the lower ratios for SESCO are acceptable.
SESCO's complement of staff is appropriate and its fill rate is satisfactory.
Manpower Development
3.14     SESCO attaches great importance to staff training, which is an
integral part of its human resource development program. It established a
training center at Biawak in 1979 to train apprentices for appointment as
mechanical/electrical technicians and to provide in-house refresher courses
for all staff. Because of the reduced demand for manpower caused by GOM's
policy of privatization, further recruitment of apprentices has been substan-
tially reduced. The in-house refresher courses provide training for power
plant operators, installation inspectors and technicians. Brief courses are
also held in basic accounting, accounts payable, and computerization. SESCO
plans to introduce staff training for 275 kV line maintenance at the Matang
substation, where three 275 kV towers will be constructed. In addition, SESCO
provides senior and middle management staff with training overseas. Seven
staff attended courses for four to eight weeks in 1986 and 17 underwent over-
seas training in 1987. Currently, two officers are attending on-the-job
training on Integrated Energy Planning with the EPU.
3.15     SESCO needs to reinforce its training of accounting staff at the
field offices (para. 3.22). Training field office accounting staff will
include a series of seminars given in Kuching, beginning with a course in
basic accounting for senior clerks and junior accounting staff scheduled for
April 1988. Subsequent training programis would be designed and implemented in
accordance with the recommendations of the consultants (para. 3.23).
Operation and Maintenance
3.16     SESCO's power statio   are classified into major (serving towns like
Kuching, Sibu, Miri, and Bintulu); urban (for towns like Sarikei, Limbang, Sri
Aman, and Kapit); and rural (for rural kampongs or villages). Major and urban
power stations are manned round the clock whereas rural stations are attended



- 12 -
during limited operating hours. Maintenance crews are stationed at major
power stations and travel to urban and rural stations to perform overhauls.
SESCO's staff are fully self-sufficient in maintaining diesel plants; however,
manufacturers' assistance is sought for supervision of gas turbine mainten-
ance. Machine manufacturers' assiitance will also be sought for scheduled
overhauls of the recently commissioned Batang Ai hydro plant. In general,
SESCO has been operating and maintaining its plant and equipment satisfactor-
ily.
Transmission and Distribution Losses
3.17     SESCO's electricity supply is spread over five major networks -
Kuching (with 1986 peak demand of 71.5 MW), Sibu (22.4 MW), Miri (16.8 MW),
Bintulu (12.8 MW) and Sarikei/Sri Aman (5.5 MW) - and the rest (11.8 MW). For
the Kuching network, currently the only one having extra high voltage (275 kV)
transmission, the composition of losses in 1986 was 102 in transmission, 8.32
in distribution and 0.62 for station use. The unexpectedly high transmission
loss is due to long, lightly loaded 275 kV transmission lines suffering from
high no-load losses (predominantly due to corona).  To reduce these losses,
efforts--with limited success--are being made to operate the 275 kV system at
the lowest feasible voltage. Transmission losses are projected to decline to
about 52 in 1992, when reasonable loading is achieved on the 275 kV lines.
The distribution losses over the period 1986-92 are projected to increase from
8.3Z to 10.82 for Kuching and from 9.32 to 12.72 for the entire system.  SESCO
is aware of the gravity of the loss problem and proposes to study distribution
losses in detail under a consultancy assignment to be funded by an ADB tech-
nical assistance grant (para. 3.7). SESCO has agreed that following comple-
tion of the consultancy study it will formulate and implement suitable action
plans satisfactory to the Bank for reducing transmission and distribution
losses.
Load Dispatch
3.18     SESCO's existing Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system located at the Biawak power station is grossly inadequate for its
current load dispatch, and system monitoring and control requirements. A new
SCADA system based on the Harris M9000 system (including software for energy
management, security analysis and automatic generation control) has recently
been ordered and will be commissioned in 1988. There then will be established
a State Dispatch Center in SESCO's headquarters at Kuching and a Regional
Dispatch Center in Sibu. With the extension of the transmission line from
Sibu to Bintulu under the proposed project, it is proposed to extend SCADA
facilities to Bintulu where a Regional Control Center would be established to
initially control six remote stations. The State Dispatch Center will be
extended to cover the extra-high voltage substations in the Bintulu area, and
a communication link will be established to the Bintulu Regional Center.
While the main SCADA system will be extended to Miri when the latter is inte-
grated into the system, small isolated SCADA systems will initially be
installed to monitor 33 kV substations in Miri. SESCO's plans for developing
its load dispatch, and supervisory control and monitoring systems with the
growth of its main power supply system are well founded and technically sound.



- 13-
Materials Handling
3.19     SESCO's Materials Division is headed by a Chief Engineer (Materials)
responsible to the Development Planning Manager. The Division comprises
Stores and Materials Sections, a Central Store and five regional store
depots. All procurement is done by the Central Store. The regional depots,
which carry only essential materials and goods for confirmed projects, obtain
stocks from the Central Store. SESCO has computerized Central Store invento-
ries, and monthly inventory reports indicate replenishment needs according to
specified formulae.
3.20     SESCO's stock level is high (para. 2.9) and efforts are being made to
dispose of obsolete items resulting from technology advancement and changes in
the corporation's policy on services to consumers. A major reason for high
stock levels is the need to allow for long delivery times from foreign sup-
pliers. SESCO recognizes that the present stock monitoring system needs a
thorough overhaul. To minimize stock holding and to improve the efficiency of
stores management, SESCO proposes to engage consultants to review its present
practices and policies, and make recommendations for improved materials hand-
ling and lower inventories. This consultancy assig,nm.ent will be financed by a
technical assistance grant from ADB (para. 3.7). At negotiations, agreement
was reached that SESCO will implement the consultants' recommendations, as
accepted in consultation with the Bank.
C. Financial Management
Accounting and Budgeting
3.21     SESCO's accounting system conforms to modern power utility practices.
It follows GOM's guidelines relating to the Statutory Bodies (Accounts and
Annual Reports) Act of 1980, which incorporates the accounting principles
promulgated by professional accounting bodies internationally and in Malaysia.
At SESCO's headquarters, most accounting applications are computerized. These
include general ledger, payroll, inventories, billing and accounts receivable
for the major stations of Kuching, Sibu and Miri (which account for about 75?
of sales) and accounts payable for Kuching. SESCO is currently upgrading its
billing and accounts receivable systems and is extending these and other
computer applications to other stations. However, as in the case of the
office procedures muanual (para. 3.8), SESCO has no codified accounts manual to
provide guidance to staff on various aspects of account keeping, financial
management and control. Periodic circulars and instructions issued by the
Finance Department deal with these matters on only a piecemeal basis. Al-
though SESCO has been concerned about the lack of a comprehensive accounts
manual and has been attempting in the last several years to prepare one, its
efforts have not been successful for want of adequate expert manpower resour-
ces. Therefore, provision has been made in the proposed project for hiring a
consultant (para. 4.2) to prepare an accounts manual for SESCO. SESCO will
assign its counterpart staff to work with the consultant, whose terms of
reference will be agreed with the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that by December 31, 1988 SESCO would employ consultants to prepare an
office procedures manual and an accounts manual.



- 14 -
3.22     SESCO's field stations, which are all identified as cost centers,
maintain their accounts on a manual basis and submit monthly returns to the
headquarters through the regional offices. These returns are examined,
discrepancies settled by correspondence and consolidated at the headquarters
for generating SESCO's periodic management and accounting reports. The field
office staff receive on-the-job training only and in many cases lack the
ability to compile the monthly accounts accarately. To minimize discrepan-
cies, SESCO will introduce a comprehensive training program for its field
office staff (para. 3.15).
3.23     To further streamline and expedite processing of the field office
monthly accounts returns, SESCO should consider decentralizing their examina-
tion and consolidation to the regional level. The headquarters would then
receive five regional accounts instead of 80 field office accounts. Since the
field offices are geographically closer to the regional offices and for most
other functions are answerable to the regional managers, the decentralization
of accounting would make the regional managers more cost conscious, help
improve regional efficiency and provide quicker information to headquarters.
The consultant preparing the accounts manual would also study and make recom-
mendations on the proposed decentralization and training of staff in the main-
tenance of accounts. At negotiations, SESCO agreed that it would implement
the consultant's recommendations as accepted in consultation with the Bank.
3.24     SESCO prepares annual budgets for its capital and operating expendi-
tures.  Quarterly reports compare actuals against budgeted amounts for each
cost center. Variations from budgets are analyzed and considered in preparing
revised budgets. The process has been operating satisfactorily and has
provided the management with an effective tool for financial control over
expenditures.
Commercial Systems
3.25     Consumer meters are read and bills issued on a monthly basis, except
in Kuching where meters are read bimonthly and bills for the month in which
meters are not read are prepared on an estimated consumption basis. Billing
for Kuching, Sibu and Miri is computerized; for other stations the billing
process is still manual. Bills are payable within 30 days and payment can be
made through SESCO's collection centers or through a "one-stop-payment" system
for all utility bills. Consumers are required to maintain a cash deposit (or
for large consumers, a Bank guarantee) equivalent to 90 days estimated average
consumption. Consumers whose bills remain unpaid for 44 days are considered
in default and in principle their service is liable for disconnection, to be
restored only after all outstanding bills, together with a service charge of
M$10, have been paid. In actual practice, however, this policy is not
enforced and accounts receivable at the end of 1986 were equal to about 90
days' sales.
3.26     Of the receivables at the end of 1986, about 22Z were owed by govern-
ment departments, 32Z by residential consumers and 45X by commercial and
Industrial consumers. Because of the slowdown in the Malaysian economy, SESCO
has adopted a policy of disconnecting consumers only when their overdue bills
exceed their 90-day deposits. SESCO is, however, concerned about its high
receivables. It is upgrading its billing and collection systems to reduce



- 15 -
delays and is considering procedural changes to require consumers to pay elec-
tricity bills within 21 days instead of the present 30 days. It is also
proposing, subject to the State Government's approval, to levy interest
charges in overdue payments. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that
SESCO would implement actions to ensure that its accounts receivable are
reduced to 75 days' sales by the end of 1989 and to 60 days' sales by the end
of 1991.
Management Information System
3.27     During the past years, SESCO has developed computerized systems for
financial planning, billing, inventory control, administrative and consumer
affairs. Except for the billing system which has been implemented for the
major load centers, other systems are operational only for Kuching. A consul-
tant's study completed in December 1986 reviewed the management of SESCO's
information requirements and proposed an action plan to implement an inte-
grated management information system for Kuching, Sibu, Bintulu and Miri.
SESCO has begun implementing the first phase of this integration which
includes computerization of warehouse operations. However, as suggested by
the consultant's study, a Management Information System (MIS) Steering
Committee needs to be formed to determine the long-term direction of MIS
development and to coordinate the purchase and use of various hardware and
software facilities by different departments. At negotiations, agreement was
reached that during the course of implementing the proposed project, SESCO
would implement action plans satisfactory to the Bank to expand and integrate
its management information system.
Audit
3.28     According to law, all public sector organizations are required to
close their accounts and submit their financial statements for audit by the
Auditor General within six months of the end of the fiscal year. Owing to a
shortage of staff, the Auditor General has retained external auditors to audit
SESCO's accounts; that audit is then subject to the approval of the Auditor
General's office. Currently, Ernst and Whinney, International Certified
Public Accountants, audit SESCO's accounts on behalf of the Auditor General.
The audit by the external auditors and its approval by the Auditor General
takes about three months. This arrangement is satisfactory to the Bank.
SESCO has agreed that it would furnish to the Bank (a) unaudited financial
statements within six months of the end of SESCO's financial year, and
(b) audited financial statements, including a separate opinion on withdrawals
made under Statements of Expenditures, toget'ner with the audit certificate and
long form report prepared by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank,
within nine months of the end of SESCO's financial year.
3.29     SESCO's Internal Auditor reports directly to the GM.  His main func-
tions include the internal auditing of the Corporation's accounts and invento-
ries, ensuring that the Corporation's accounting, billing and financial proce-
dures are observed by all departments, examining the effectiveness of controls
established by the management for safeguarding the Corporation's assets and
conducting special investigations as directed by the GM. The Internal Auditor
is assisted by a staff of 15 who conduct audits at headquarters and at each of
the regional and field stations. This arrangement is satisfactory.



- 16 -
Taxes
3.30     SESCO has in the past been exempted from payment of income tax,
customs duties and sales tax, but its income tax exemption is scheduled to
lapse in 1987. On the basis of discussions with federal authorities, however,
SESCO believes that it will be allowed to continue to enjoy a tax holiday; it
has submitted its petition for this exemption to GOM through the State Govern-
ment. If SESCO's petition is denied, it will become liable to pay income tax
for 1987 onwards at 45Z of its taxable income. If such payment is required,
SESCO will need to increase tariffs as explained in para. 5.23.
Dividends
3.31     Under the 1962 SESCO Ordinance, SESCO's Board may declare dividends
but the dividend may not exceed 62 of the paid-in capital in any year. In
each of the last five years, SESCO declared dividends of 5Z to 62. The div-
idends for 1983-85, totaling M$7.0 million, were not disbursed but were added
to the State Government's share capital. SESCO plans to pay dividends to the
Government for 1986 onwards at the rate of 6Z p.a.
Insurance
3.32     SESCO retains the services of a local insurance broker who provides
expert advice regarding risk management. It purchases insurance coverage for
various risks and reviews its insurance program yearly. The main risks
covered include fire and peril, public liability, goods-in-transit, and motor
vehicle accidents. These arrangements are acceptable to the Bank.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Obiectives and Description
4.1      The objectives of the proposed project are to utilize Sarawak's
natural gas resources to meet electricity demand in the state, to enhance
operational efficiency through system integration, and to strengthen the
institutional capabilities of SESCO in the areas of system planning, engineer-
:ng design and accounting.
4.2      The project includes the following components:
'a) the first phase (2 x 30 MW gas turbine generator sets) of a 90 MW
combined-cycle gas-fired power station at Bintulu;
(b)  185 km of double circuit, 275 kV transmission line from Bintulu to
Sibu with associated substations;
(c) a regional load dispatch center at Bintulu;
(d) consulting services for engineering of the power station, transmis-
sion line and substations, and architectural and engineering services
for civil works; and
(e) efficiency improvement through:
(i) a gas utilization study;
(ii) upgrading of SESCO's system planning and engineering design
capabilities through acquisition of modern computer hardware,
planning software and training of staff; and
(iii)  consultancy assistance for strengthening SESCO's accounting and
office practices.
Combined-cycle Power Station
4.3      The combined-cycle power station will be installed at Bintulu on a
plot of land acquired by SESCO about 1.2 miles north-east of SESCO's existing
30 MW gas turbine power plant.   This location is optinal considering (a) soil
conditions for foundations; (b) the plant's cooling water requirements from
the sea; and (c) the plant's natural gas fuel requirements through Petronas'
existing pipeline termination. The ultimate power plant would comprise two
30-MW capacity gas-turbine generator sets, a waste heat recovery boiler and a
30-MW capacity steam-turbine generator set. In the first phase, which consti-
tutes this project, only two 30-MW gas turbine generator sets will be
installed. When operated in the open-cycle mode, the two gas-turbine genera-
tor sets would produce 60 MW of output at an efficiency of about 28Z. In the
combined-cycle mode the plant would provide its full output of 90 MW at a
considerably enhanced efficiency of about 42Z.

Transmission Lines and Substations
4.4      A 185-km transmission line will link Bintulu to Sibu.  It will be a
double circuit 275 kV steel tower line with 2 x 400 mm2 ASCR conductors and
twin shield wires. A 275 kV substation will be established at Bintulu with
the required switching bays and 2 x 30 HVA, 275/11 kV transformers for connec-
ting the combined-cycle units and 2 x 30 MVA, 275/33 kV transformers for local
distribution. The 275 kV substation at Sibu will, in addition to the 275 kV
line switching arrangements, be provided with 2 x 80 HVA, 275/132 kV transfor-
mers (released from the existing Kemantan substation) to establish a 132 kV
point of stupply. The existing 275/132/33 kV substation at Kemantan will be
provided with 2 x 30 MVA, 275/132 kV transformers and the required switching
bays.
Regional Load Dispatch Center at Bintulu
4.5      The regional load dispatch center at Bintulu (which will be a
Regional Control Center initially controlling six remote stations) forms part
of SESCO's plan for expanding its load dispatch and supervisory control and
monitoring operations (para. 3.18). This regional load dispatch center will
be suitably located in the combined-cycle power plant area and will have the
necessary SCADA facilities.
Gas Utilization Study
4.6      The gas utilization study proposed under the project will address the
economics of application of gas from the Miri and Bintulu gas fields in
Sarawak primarily for (a) power generation requirements of both Sarawak and
Sabah and (b) prospective large gas based industries in Sarawak. The study
will cover inter alia an assessment of the quantum and cost of gas production
and transmission; the optimum location and sizing of power plants; the econo-
mics of transmission of gas based power from Sarawak to Sabah vis-a-vis power
generation in Sabah; and major issues involved in the construction of large
gas based industries in Sarawak including prospects for export. The study
will be managed by the EPU which is currently preparing the terms of
reference. Substantial assistance will be required from the Bank in formulat-
ing the terms of reference and in supervising she implementation of the study.
B. Cost Estimates
4.7      The estimated cost of the proposed project is US$101.0 million,
including foreign costs of US$72.0 million (71Z) but excluding US$12.4 million
in interest on the Bank loan during construction. The project is exempted by
Government from all taxes and duties. All costs are based on December 1987
prices; physical contingencies are assumed at lOZ. Price contingencies, which
amount to abouc SZ of the base cost plus physical contingencies, are computed
on the basis of the following escalation factors for (a) local costs--1988,
2.1Z; 1989-90, 2.8Z and 3.5Z. thereafter; and (b) foreign costs--1988-90, 3.0Z
and b.OZ thereafter. The project cost estimate is summarized in Table 4.1 and
detailed in Annex 5.

4.9      The proposed Bank loan of US$56.0 million will meet about 49Z of the
total financing required for the project or about 782 of the foreign exchange
cost excluding interest during construction. SESCO will finance the balance
from its internal cash generation and export credit/commercial borrowing.
D. Proiect Implementation, Procurement and Disbursement
Project Implementation and Consultancy Services
4.10     SESCO will be the implementing agency for the project.  A foreign
consulting firm has been retained following Bank guidelines to assist SESCO in
basic engineering, preparation of bid and contract documents, evaluation of
bids, review of vendor drawings and construction supervision for the combined-
cycle power plant. An estimated 100 man-months of services will be needed.
The consulting firm has completed optimization of plant size and location and
has prepared a detailed cost estimate. Preparation of bid documents will be
completed by June 1988. Having already constructed the 275 kV Batang Ai-
Kuching transmission system and the 275 kV Engkilli-Sibu line, SESCO has
adequate expertise to implement the 275 kV transmission line and substations
under the proposed project. Engineering studies for the 275 kV line and sub-
stations and preparation of bid documents have been completed by consultants
and the same consultants have been retained for bid evaluation and follow-up
engineering and supervision services amounting to 60 man-months. Local civil
engineers and architects will be employed for the design of buildings and
systems such as lighting, water supply and ventillation. Overall, some 280
man-months of consulting services, at an estimated base cost of US$4.4 mil-
lion, will be needed, including 220 man-months of foreign consultants and 60
man-months of local consultants.



- 21 -
Procurement
4.11     All equipment and services financed under the proposed Bank loan
would be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Under ICB, local manufacturers will
be permitted to participate where appropriate and be eligible for a preference
of 15Z of the CIF cost of imported goods or the prevailing customs duties and
other import taxes, whichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids. Conductors
for transmission lines, which are now available in Malaysia and are of good
quality, will be rese-Jed for local procurement and will not be financed by
the Bank loan. Civil works for the power plant and substations will be
procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) using SESCO's normal proce-
dures which are acceptable to the Bank.
4.12     All bidding packages for goods financed by  1- Bank and estimated to
cost over US$1,000,000 equivalent would be subject  o '.he Bank's prior review
of procurement documents. It is expected that almost all procurement docu-
ments will be reviewed.
4.13     The following major procurement packages are proposed for ICB:
(a) the entire first phase of the combined-cycle power station under a single
responsibility supply and erect contract; (b) supply of steel towers, insula-
tors and hardware and construction of the 275 kV transmission line; and
(c) equipment for the load despatch center. Switchgears, ancillary equipment
and transformers for substations will be procured through export credit or
other borrowing arrangements.
4.14     Table 4.3 summarizes procurement arrangements under the project and
the allocation of the proposed Bank loan.

- 23 -
Disbursements
4.15     The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 1002 of foreign expendi-
tures for directly imported equipment and materials; (b) 100% of local expen-
ditures ex-factory of locally manufactured items procured through ICB;
(c) 10OZ of expenditures for consulting services; and (d' 70% of local expend-
itures for works related to procurement under ICB.
4.16     Reimbursements of expenditures relating to contracts valued at less
than US$200,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of statements of expen-
diture (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs would not be submitted to
the Bank but would be retained by SESCO and made available for review by Bank
supervision missions. To facilitate project disbursements, a Special Account
in a fully convertible currency will be established in a bank on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The autho-ized allocation to the Special
Account is US$2.9 million, representing about four months' average project
expenditure. Replenishment of the Special Account would be made quarterly or
whenever the Account is drawn down by about 50% of the initial deposit.
4.17     Retroactive financing is proposed for expenditures of up to US$1.0
million equivalent made after December 15, 1987 to cover advanced contracting
for consultancy services.
4.18     The disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan (Annex 6) is
generally in line with the Bank's profile of disbursements for power projects
in the Asian Region. The Closing Date of the Loan would be June 30, 1994.
Implementation Arrangements and Schedule
4.19     The project implementation schedule is shown in Chart 2.  All project
components are expected to be implemented by June 30, 1993. SESCO will be the
primary agency responsible for implementation. Power plant installation work
will be supervised in detail by consultants. Transmission lines will be cons-
tructed on a turn-key basis by the contractor, with SESCO arranging for the
necessary way leaves. Civil works for the plant buildings and substations
will be entrusted to a few local contractors, while erection and commissioning
of the switchgear and transformers will be undertaken by the equipment sup-
pliers. Consultants will also provide supervisory assistance to SESCO for
construction of the transmission line and substations. Installation and
commissioning of computer systems hardware and software for the load dispatch
center will be done by SESCO engineers with supervisory assistance from the
equipment suppliers.
Monitoring and Reporting
4.20     Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in
terms of physical execution and financial reports have been agreed with SESCO,
which will furnish quarterly progress reports. A project completion report
will be submitted by SESCO not later than six months after completion of
project activities.

E. Environment
4.21     The project is not expected to have any adverse effects on the
environment. As the power plant will burn natural gas having negligible
sulphur content, atmospheric pollution due to sulphur compounds and dust
particles is not expected. The main pollution due to nitrogen compounds will
be kept within acceptable limits. Emission levels in the atmosphere, ground
level concentrations and pollutant concentrations discharged into the sea will
meet the Bank's environmental criteria and comply with the requirements of the
Environmental Quality Act 1974 of the Government of Malaysia.  The increase in
sea temperature brought on by the discharge of cooling water from the plant
will be kept within levels complying with the Malaysian standards. There is
no fishing activity in the vicinity of cooling water discharge. The transmis-
sion line will be designed in accordance with internationally accepted safety
practices and the line route will be selected to cause minimum disturbance to
the environment. An Environmental Impact Assessment prepared by SESCO and its
consultants was reviewed by the Bank and was found to provide a comprehensive
outline of potential environmental impacts. At negotiations SESCO agreed that
it would: (a) take measurements of existing NOx levels within a 1-2 km radius
of the plant site and provide estimates of expected NOx levels and that appro-
priate mitigatory measures to assure that Bank standards for NOx are met will
be agreed upon and implemented; and (b) take measures to bring in-plant noise
levels below 70dB or take appropriate safety measures, such as sound-proofed
observation structures and mandatory use of protective equipment.

V. FINANCE
A. Introduction
5.1      SESCO is a statutory corporation and as such has responsibility for
maintaining satisfactory revenues, meeting its expenses and debt service, and
formulating and financing its investment program. It has the power to borrow
money to meet its obligations and to discharge its functions. In setting and
adjusting its tariff, SESCO must obtain approval of the State Government.
B. Past and Present Financial Performance
5.2      SESCO's financial performance for the period 1982-86 is given in
Annex 9. Key financial indicators for that period are presented in Table 5.1.

5.3      SESCO has been a strong financial performer during the last five
years. Its rate of return on the historical value of its average net fixed
assets (less consumers' contributions) ranged between 37S and 392 during
1982-84, due mainly to a low rate base resulting from the financing of a
substantial portion of its assets from consumers' contributions. With the
completion of the Batang Ai hydro project in 1985 and the inclusion of those
assets in the rate base, SESCO's rate base increased by about five times its
1982 level. The Batang Ai hydro project helped reduce SESCO's average fuel
cost per kWh generated by about 30? in 1985 and 602 in 1986, but the increase
in other operating expenses, the larger provision for depreciation, and the
much higher rate base brought down SESCO's rate of return to 16? in 1985 and
12? in 1986. On a revalued assets base, SESCO's rate of return was between
13? and 16? in 1982-84, 11? in 1985 and 9Z in 1986. Its average self-
financing ratio during the five years was 39?. During the period 1983-85,
SESCO had to resort to heavy borrowing to finance the Batang Ai hydro project
and other capital investments. This increased its debt service obligation,
which was increased further by a depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit against
the Japanese yen and other currencies in which SESCO's long-term debt is deno-
minated (para. 5.8). As a result, SESCO's debt service coverage dropped from
3.0 times requirements or higher during 1982-85 to 1.8 times in 1986, and its
debt/debt plus equity ratio rose from 372 in 1982, to 502 in 1984 and 64? in
1986. The 1986 debt service coverage, although lower than in previous years,
remains at an acceptable level. However, the debt/debt plus equity ratio is
marginally above a prudent level and should be brought down to not greater
than 60? (para. 5.21).
5.4      High rates ef return over the 1982-86 period were further enhanced by
SESCO's fixed asset accounting practices. With the exception of the Batang Ai
hydro project, assets were transferred from work in progress to gross fixed
assets only after substantial delays--sometimes of up to two years after
project completion because of delays in receipt of required completion certif-
icates from engineers and construction supervisors. These certificates were
typically issued at least six months after actual project completion. If
headquarters received the certificates before September 30, the transfer from
work in progress was made in the accounts of that year; if the certificates
were received after September, the transfer was made at the end of the follow-
ing year, or as much as 15 months later. All projects--whether for genera-
tion, transmission, or distribution--remained under work in progress until the
entire project was completed, even if portions thereof were already opera-
tional. Thus, the gross fixed assets in operation were understated. It is
estimated that if completed assets had been transferred from work in progress
to fixed assets, the rate of return on the revalued assets base in 1986 would
have been about 82, rather than the 102 achieved under SESCO's accounting
approach.2/ SESCO has recently taken a decision that all assets which are
operational but which are still shown under work-in-progress will be trans-
ferred to 'fixed assetsw in the 1988 accounts. In addition, SESCO has
2/ Because of the difficulty in identifying the year of completion of each
asset, SESCO's past financial statements have not been recast to show
the effect of capitalizing assets at the correct time. In the
financial projections (Annex 9), 40? of the assets in work in progress
at year end are capitalized at the end of the next year with the
remainder capitalized at the end of the second year.



- 27 -
increased the frequency of its capitalization exercise from once a year to
four times a year and will continue this practice to ensure that its rate base
includes all assets which are operational.
Fixed Assets Revaluation
5.5      SESCO's fixed assets are carried on its books at their historical
cost. In connection with the proposed takeover of the corporation by GOM
(para. 3.3), a detailed revaluation exercise was carried out by outside
surveyors, C.H. Williams, Talhar, Wong and Yeo (Malaysia). The surveyors
estimated that the fair market value of SESCO's assets as of December 31,
1983, based on their replacement cost, was H$346.1 million, about 692 higher
than their historical cost. Although SESCO will continue to maintain its
accounts on an historical basis, it has agreed to adopt the revalued asset
rate base for calculating its rate of return in the future. The current value
of SESCO's assets will be calculated based on the surveyor's valuation and
updated each year by a fixed assets deflator published annually by GOM.
Liquidity
5.6      In the past, SESCO's current ratio (defined as current assets net of
excess liquidity investments divided by current liabilities) has averaged
about 2002. If investments of excess cash (amounting to MS$249.4 million at
end of 1986) are added, the current ratio over the past five years would
average almost 5002. During the 1982-86 period, SESCO determined that it
could make money by borrowing--mostly from GOM but also from foreign lenders-
-and it not only borrowed a substantial portion of project costs, leaving
retained earnings to build up short-term investments, but it also increased
liquidity by making drawdowns on loans before funds were needed for relevant
project expenditures. Due to favorable interest rate spreads between borrow-
ing costs and investment proceeds, SESCO's earnings from liquidity investments
exceeded the total interest charges on its debt in 1983 and 1984; in these
years short-term liquidity investments amounted to 562 and 322 of SESCO's
long-term debt.
5.7      The above strategy, however, turned against SESCO by 1986 when liqui-
dity investments still amounted to over 302 of long-term debt. In that year,
interest on short-term holdings fell, making a positive spread impossible.
Furthermore, on loans borrowed in foreign currencies, SESCO incurred
substantial foreign exchange losses (para. 5.9). SESCO now plans to use its
excess cash to finance capital expenditures and to reduce its outstanding
debt; it expects to reduce its liquidity investments substantially by 1992.
Foreign Exchange Exposure
5.8      As of December 31, 1986, SESCO's long-term debt amounted to H$868.8
million, of which M$603.4 million (702) was denominated in foreign currencies.
The balance of M$265.4 million was provided by GOM and the Employees Provident
Fund in local currency. About 572 of the foreign loans came from Mitsui Trust
and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, 322 were ADB loans
in various currencies (relent by GOM to SESCO) and the remaining 112 were in
other currencies. A detailed statement of SESCO's long-term debt is shown in
Annex 7.



- 28 -
5.9      SESCO's long-term foreign loans as of December 31, 1987 included
about M$254.0 million of foreign exchange losses resulting from appreciation
of the yen and other currencies in which the foreign loans are repayable.
SESCO determines its losses according to the exchange rates itn effect on
December 31 of each year. It shows the losses in its books under a Foreign
Exchange Deferred Account, which it plans to write off to revenue when pay-
ments of the loan installments are made. On this basis, SESCO estimates that
over the period 1988-96, a sum of H$120.3 million will be written off to
revenue (ranging from a minimum of M$2.5 million in 1988 to a maximum of
M$25.1 million in 1991), and the deferred foreign exchange loss will be
reduced to M$133.7 million.
5.10     The above plan to write off deferred foreign exchange losses suffers
from two drawbacks: (a) it will take a long time to clear the loss; and (b) it
does not spread the loss evenly in future years' financial results. The
approach understates the foreign exchange loss shown in SESCO's income state-
ment (by about M$10 million in 1987 and 1988) by deferring the loss on loans
with repayment grace periods. The Bank has suggested that SESCO consider
writing off the deferred losses against its reserves (retained earnings) in
one lump sum or, alternatively, spreading the losses over the unexpired lives
of the respective loans to even out the effect of the losses on its annual
financial results.
5.11     SESCO's deferred foreign exchange loss is significant and amounts to
about 95Z of its accumulated retained earnings or about 38Z of its total net
worth as of December 31, 1987.  If the Malaysian ringgit depreciates further,
SESCO will face additional losses in the future. SESCO is deeply concerned
about this situation and is taking steps to better manage its foreign exchange
risks. Where possible, it is taking advantage of refinancing opportunities to
reduce the cost and exposure of its existing foreign loans.   At negotiations,
SESCO agreed that it would discuss its foreign exchange accounting practices
with the Auditor General by September 30, 1988 and that after consultation
with the Auditor General, it would introduce into its accounts for 1989
policies and practices which properly reflect the impact of its foreign
exchange exposure and which would be designed and implemented in accordance
with international accounting standards (while also being consistent with
Malaysian accounting practices).
C. Tariffs
5.12     Under its ordinance, SESCO must obtain the State Government's
approval before making any changes in its tariffs. In the past, SESCO's
recommendations in this regard were generally accepted by the Government. A
major reform in SESCO's tariffs was introduced in 1978, which: (a) abolished
tariff differentiation relating to the type of use in the residential sector;
(b) regrouped the previous subcategories of commercial customers into a single
tariff; (c) regrouped water-works and industrial tariffs; (d) added high
voltage (HV) commercial and industrial tariffs; and (e) introduced a fuel cost
variation charge (FCVC) as the basis for adjusting the tariff level. After
1978, tariffs evolved only under the effect of the FCVC, which reached MH9/kWh
by 1981 and was kept at that level until March 1986. In March 1986, the
equivalent of an FCVC of MP8/kWh was incorporated into the tariff and the FCVC



- 29 -
was formally suspended. This represented a M4l/kWh or 3.42 reduction in
tariffs. In addition, tariff discounts of 10? were introduced for licensed
hotels and private sector industrial customers. SESCO's tariffs are presented
in Annex 8.                                       0
5.13     For tariff purposes, SESCO divides its service area into two classes.
Class I stations are Kuching, Sibu, Miri and Bintulu; all the rest are Class
II stations. Consumers in Class II stations pay M13/kWh more than consumers
in Class I stations. In Peninsular Malaysia and in Sabah, however, NEB's and
SEB's tariffs are uniform for all stations. SESCO's present average tariff of
M428.1/kWh is 16? lower than SEB's average but about 26? higher than NEB's
tariff. Because of SESCO's much higher cost of serving the population in
distant rural and geographically remote areas, a tariff higher than NEB's is
justified.
5.14     In June 1987, SESCO completed an extensive tariff studv with the
assistance of consultants (Hydro Quebec, Canada). The consultant's recommend-
ations are being reviewed by SESCO management. The main conclusion reached by
the consultants is that the present tariffs are appropriate and that no major
changes are warranted. As a result of the interconnection of various regions
within the SESCO network through the construction of a transmission line
expected to be completed in 1988, as well as through the substitution of
natural gas for oil and diesel, cost levels are expected to decline. Until
1994, SESCO should attain its financial objectives without increasing its
tariffs, thus actually dropping its rates gradually in real terms. Beginning
in 1994, minor tariff increases will be required for SESCO to meet its finan-
cial objectives.  Such a tariff policy is acceptable.
D. Financina Plan
5.15     SESCO's financing plan for the proposed project implementation
period, 1988-94, is provided in Table 5.2.

La Including interest during construction.
5.16     The proposed project, including interest during construction, repre-
sents about 25Z of SESCO's investment program for the period. The proposed
Bank loan, which would be extended directly to SESCO for a term of 15 years
(including three years of grace on repayment of principal) and bear the stan-
dard variable interest rate, would meet 12Z of SESCO's total financing
requirement for the period. Of the balance, 412 would be met from internal
cash generation (including consumer capital contributions), 8Z from government
grants for rural electrification and mini hydro development, and 14? from
SESCO's short-term liquidity deposits (para. 5.7). About 252 of SESCO's
investment requirements are expected to be met from other loans. The proposed
financing plan is acceptable. However, during negotiations assurances were
obtained from GOM that if at any time funds available to SESCO are inadequate
to meet the estimated expenditures required for carrying out the project, GOM
will promptly make satisfactory arrangements to provide SESCO with the funds
needed for the project.

E. Future Finance
5.17     Projections of SESCO's financial performance fcr the period 1987-96,
together with assumptions underlying those projections, are presented in
Annex 9. Key financial indicators are presented in Table 5.3.
5.18     In 1987, SESCO expects to complete much of the substantial expansion
currently under way, and capital expenditures in 1988 will be less than half
the previous year's level. Investments are projected to grow at modest rates
between 1989 and 1996. SESCO's rate base (revalued net fixed assets less
consumers' contributions) is projected to increase to only about 2.7 times its
1986 level over the ten years 1987-96.
5.19     SESCO's sales growth during the four-year period 1983-86 ranged
between 6.31 and 14.2Z, with an average of about 11Z p.a. On the basis of
SESCO's load forecasts, modified to reflect the slowdown in the Malaysian
economy, the financial projections assume that sales will grow at a modest 9Z
p.a. Fuel expenses, based on SESCO's least cost generation plan, are esti-
mated to decline from the current level of about Mt4.35/kWh to Mt2.68/kWh in
1989, and thereafter to increase gradually to Mr3.69/kwh in 1993 and
M45.07/kwh in 1996. These projections assume increased generation of hydro-
power, a constant price of M$2.70/MMBTU of gae until 1996 (which on the Bank's
recommendation has already been agreed in principle between SESCO and
Petronas), and a price increase of 2.5Z p.a. plus inflation for oil.
5.20     SESCO's tariff currently yields a revenue of arout M428.1/kWh sold.
It is expected that revenue at this level would be adequate to produce a
satisfactory rate of return through 1993.  Minor tariff increases would then
be required in 1994, 1995 and 1996. To ensure SESCO's continued financial
viability, it is important that it realizes revenues sufficient to meet its
operating expenses, including adequate provision for depreciation, taxes, and
dividends, and to produce a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets (less
consumers' contributions) of at least 8Z.  This rate of return would enable
SESCO to service its heavy debt, cover its foreign exchange losses, and
finance a reasonable part of its future investment. The projections show that
SESCO's self-financing ratio over the 1987-96 projected period will be about
38Z. At negotiations, agreement was reached with SESCO and GOM that SESCO
would take all actions, including but not limited to revision of tariffs, to
achieve the minimum 8X rate of return. Since tariff revision requires
approval of the Sarawak State Government (para. 5.12), assurances were
provided by the Sarawak State Government to the Federal Government that the
former would endorse tariff increases required to meet the covenanted 8Z rate
of return.
5.21     SESCO's heavy long-term debt (para. 5.8) will involve large debt
service payments in the coming years. Its current debt/debt plus equity ratio
of 66Z (not including, as part of equity, the revaluation reserve) is high.
It is projected to decline to 60? in 1989, to 51Z in 1991, and to about 44Z in
1996. No further injection of government equity is projected through 1996,
and the decrease in the ratio results mainly from insignificant further
borrowing needed to support the modest investment program expected in the
projection period. Hcwev-r, owing to its sizeable existing debt as well as

its foreign exchange exposure and the possibility that unfavorable variations
in exchange rates could further weaken its capital structure, agreement was
reached during negotiations that SESCO would not incur any further debt if
such additional debt would raise its total debt to more than 602 of its total
capital (net of any reserve for revaluation of assets).
5.22     SESCO's debt service coverage in the past has stayed in a comfortable
range of between 5.4 and 1.8 times its requirements. The financial projec-
tions show that its debt service coverage would drop to 1.4 times in 1987 and
be between 1.3 and 1.9 times throughout the projected period, With a view to
guarding against the debt service coverage dropping below acceptable levels,
SESCO agreed during negotiations that it would not incur additional debt
unless a reasonable forecast shows that its estimated net revenues after
expenditures for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be
at least 1.3 times its total estimated debt service requirements in such year,
including the debt to be incurred.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.23     A sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the effect on
SESCO's financial results over the 1987-96 period of (a) sales growing at
8Z p.a. instead of the 9Z assumed in the financial projections; (b) payment by
SESCO of income tax at 45Z of its net income; and (c) both sales growth at 82
and payment of income tax. The analysis shows that SESCO's operating results
are not sensitive to a 1 percentage point decline in annual sales growth
because the decrease in revenues would be offset by corresponding savings from
the decrease in expensive oil-based generation. No major tariff adjustments
would be required to meet the covenants proposed in paras. L20, 5.21 and
5.22. On the other hand, if SESCO is subjected to payment of income tax, it
would need to increase its average tariff by about 92 in 1988, 62 in 1989 and
between 32 and 52 per year during 1993-96 in order to achieve the minimum 82
rate of return. Should both adverse factors occur, i.e., sales growth decline
to 82 p.a. and payment of income tax, the increases in tariff required to meet
the minimum rate of return would be about the same as in the income tax
scenario.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Justification
6.1      The proposed project encompasses the first phase of a least-cost
development program designed within a consolidated framework to minimize the
total cost of power generation in Malaysia. Its components all contribute to
reorienting the Sarawak power sector to a development path with substantial
savings in capital and operating costs.
6.2      The combined-cycle power plant would be the first step toward
utilizing natural gas in base-load power generation. It will enable SESCO to
expand its generating capacity at a capital cost equivalent to 30Z of that of
an alternative hydro plant or a fuel cost equivalent to 25Z of an alternative
oil-fired plant. The transmission line is required to transport the power
generated by the gas-based combined-cycle power plant to the major load
centers of the SESCO grid. The transmission line is also an integral part of
an interconnection which would enable SESCO to reduce its reserve margin and
improve its reliability of service.
6.3      The gas utilization study is needed in order to assess the feasibi-
lity of utilizing flared gas from Miri to meet part of the power demand in
Sarawak and possibly Sabah. Finally, upgrading of planning capabilities is
required in order to ensure the economic efficiency of Sarawak's future power
development programs.
B. Economic Analysis
6.4      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) has been computed for the
entire SESCO (1988-2001) investment program as well as for the two main
project components, the power plant and the transmission line.
SESCO's Investment Program
6.5      SESCO's least-cost investment program for 1988-2001 has been derived
through an extensive simulation/optimization exercise which was carried out
during the 1986 Bank sector study (para. 2.6) in order to examine the inter-
relationships of the investment programs of Malaysia's three power utilities.
The investment program used in the present computations represents SESCO's
part of a development plan which would minimize the cost of power generation
to the entire Malaysian economy.
6.6      The IERR of SESCO's investment program, based on Odirectl benefits
measured in terms of revenues, is about 23Z (Annex 10), which is higher than
the opportunity cost of capital (10Z). With the incorporation of consumer
surplus, based on the demand functions for various consumer groups, the IERR
increases to 38Z.



- 35 -
Economic Return for Project Components
6.7      The economic return on the combined-cycle power plant can be assessed
by comparing the discounted cost of this plant with its next best alternative,
the Ulu Ai hydroelectric power plant. With adjustments for differences in
energy-generating capabilities and the useful lives of the two plants, the
cost of the combined-cycle plant remains less than that of the Ulu Ai project
at discount rates above 6Z.
6.8      The economic analysis of the transmission line was carried out
through simulation studies for the period 1987-2010 of (a) each of the
isolated electric systems of SESCO; and (b) the integrated system with various
dates of interconnection. The results indicate that the optimal timing of
interconnection is 1992 when additional capacity will have to be added at
Kuching-Sibu, as well as at Bintulu. By interconnecting the system in 1992,
SESCO can reduce its reserve margin so that the total capacity requirements
for the period 1986-2010 can be lowered by 12X.  The total discounted coSta of
the interconnected system will increase by M$34 million if the interconnection
is postponed to 1995.
6.9      Finally, an economic analysis was carried out for the project
assuming that the entire transmission cost is associated with the combined-
cycle power plant. The IERP. was estimated at 20Z. This rate understates the
economic return of the project but indicates the lower bound to the project's
IERR.
C. Risks
6.10     The project faces no substantial risk.  There is a possibility that a
delay in obtaining rights-of-way for the transmission line could delay full
utilization of the power station. However, the likelihood of this delay is
small and there is some slack built into the transmission line schedule.
Further the project's rate of return is sufficiently high to tolerate a
partial utilization of the power plant for up to two years.

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
7.1      During negotiations agreements were obtained from SESCO on the
following main points:
Agreements with SESCO
(a) by December 31, 1988 SESCO will employ consultants to (i) prepare an
office procedures manual and an accounts manual; (ii) study and make
recommendations for decentralization of field office accounts to the
regional level; and (iii) training of staff in the maintenance of
accounts. The consultants' recommendations will be implemented as
accepted in consultation with the Bank (paras. 3.8, 3.21 and 3.23);
(b) following completion of the ADB-financed study, SESCO will formulate
and implement suitable action plans satisfactory to the Bank for:
(a) reducing transmission and distribution losses; and (b) improved
materials handling and inventories (paras. 3.17 and 3.20);
(c) SESCO will implement actions to ensure that its accounts receivable
are reduced to not more than 75 days' sale by the end of 1989 and 60
days' sales by the end of 1991 (para. 3.26);
(d) SESCO will implement action plans satisfactory to the Bank to expand
and integrate its management information system (para. 3.27);
(e) SESCO will furnish to the Bank (i) unaudited financial statements
within six months of the end of its financial year; and (ii) audited
financial statements together with the audit certificates and long
form report, prepared by an independent auditor acceptable to the
Bank, within nine months of the end of its financial year (para.
3.28);
(f) SESCO will take steps, including but not limited to increasing its
tariff, to achieve a rate of return of at least 8Z on the current
value of its net fixed assets less consumers' contributions (para.
5.20);
(g) SESCO will not incur additional debt if such additional debt would
raise SESCO's debt to more than 60Z of total capital, net of any
reserve for revaluation of assets (para. 5.21); and
(h) SESCO will incur additional debt only if a reasonable forecast shows
that its net revenues after expenditures for each year during the
term of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.3 times SESCO's
total debt service requirements (para. 5.22).
Recommendation
7.2      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$56 million to SESCO for
a 15-year term including three years grace at the standard variable interest
rate. The loan will be guaranteed by the Government of Malaysia.

MALAYSIA
SARAWAK POWER PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
Income Statement
1.        Total Generation required to meet the power demand for 1987 through
1966, broken down by each source of generation (i.e., hydro, combined cycle,
gas turbine, diesel and oil), is shown in the table entitled "Derivation of
SESCO Generation and Expenses" (page 4 of this Annex).  This follows SESCO's
least-cost generation plan.
2.        Transmission and Distribution Losses are about 19% in 1986 and 20%
in 1987.  They are projected to remain at that level through 1989, but in view
of the actions being initiated by SESCO (para. 3.17) these losses are
projected to decline to 19% in 1990 through 1992, and to be reduced further to
18% from 1993 to 1996.
3.        Power Sold.  Power sales increased 12.8% in 1982, 8.4% in 1983,
'     ill 1i9fl 14 327  in      W. lnV 3 .n 'l986, andtC 8.6  in 1987.  Based on
SESCO's load forecasts, as modified downwards by the mission, power sales are
projected to increase 9% per annum over 1987 levels.
4.        Income fr)m Electricity Sales assumes that the average tariff in
effect as of 1987 will not change through 1993. Further increases of 3%, 1%
and 5Z in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively, are forecast to enable SESCO to
earn a rate of return of 8% on its revalued net fixed assets (less consumers'
contributions).
5.        Other Operating Revenue, which is comprised of rechargeable works
and miscellaneous receipts, is projected to increase by 3% per year.
6.        Fuel expenses are derived in the table entitled "Derivation of
SEECO's Generation and Expenses," which shows the generation by each source,
volume of fuel consumption per kWh of generation, the base unit price and the
total cost of fuel. Light oil, medium oil and diesel prices are projected to
increase at an annual rate of 2.5% plus inflation. The inflation rates
assumed are 3.5% p.a. in 1987, 1% in 1988-90 and 3.5% thereafter. Petronas
has agreed in principle to supply gas to SESCO at the rate of M$2.7/MMBTU up
to 1996. The projections for natural gas follow this agreement.
7.        Other Cash Operating Expenses are derived in the table entitled
"Derivation of SESCO Generation and Expenses." There were projected based on
historical rates and relative sales growth rates. Inclusive of the price
escalation factors listed in para. 6, the projections assume annual increases
at the foilowing rates: (a) Generation Expenses--9%; (b) Transmission and
Distribution Expenses--10%; (c) Consumer Services Costs--9Z; (d) Training and
Welfare Expenses--2Z; (e) Administrative Charges--5%, and (f) General
Expenses--l1Z.

ANNEX 9
Page 6 of 8
8.        Depreciatior is forecast to be 3% of revalued gross fixed assets.
SESCO depreciates its assets on a straight line method based on their expected
l ives.
9.        Interest from Short Term Deposits assumes that SESCO will continue
earning interest on its liquidity investment at the rate of 4.75% p.a.
10.       Transfer from Capital Contributions to revenue are projected at 45
of capital contributions. This is based on the 25-year average life of
distribution lines, for which the contributions are mainly received.
11.       Interest on existing loans has been calculated at the rates at which
the loans were contracted. For new loans, interest is projected at an average
rate of 8% p.a.
12.       Income Tax.  SESCO has been exempted in the past from payment of
income tax but the exemption is scheduled to lapse after 1986. SESCO has,
however, petitioned for continuation of the tax exemption, which it believes
will be approved. Accordingly, the projections do not provide any income tax
payments by SESCO. Should SESCO's request be turned down, SESCO will be
liable to pay income tax at 45% of its taxable income.
13.       Dividend payment to the state Government of Sarawak is projected at
the maximum permissible rate of 6% p.a.
Flows of Funds
14.       Consumer Capital Contributions are expected to increase at 5% per
year.
15.       Working Capital represents the difference between current assets and
current liabilities. It includes cash and bank overdrafts but excludes
investments of excess liquidity.
16.       Principal Repayments of Loans are projected on the basis of the
repayment terms in existing loan agreements, with the exception that M$10
million of a bullet loan due in 1991 is expected to be refinanced and paid in
1992. It is assumed that IBRD loan repayments will begin in 1992 (after three
years of grace). Drawdowns on other loans would not begin until 1994 and it
is assumed that those loans would not be repaid within the projected period.
17.       Government Grants for Hydro and Rural Electrification are projected
to cover SESCO's investments in these projects, which will be financed 100%
through Federal Government grants.
18.       IBRD Loan - Proposed Project.  Disbursements from the IBRD loan are
projected to correspond to the expenditures on the proposed project which are
eligible for Bank financing.
19.       Committed and Existing Loans drawdowns are projected on the basis of
the terms contained in the existing SESCO loan agreements.

20.       Capitalized Interest on the IBRD-financed project includes interest
due on the IBRD loan until 1993, when the project is expected to be
completed. The average interest rate assumed is 8%.
21.       Capital Investment and Capitalized Interest of Other Projects are
projected according to SESCO's current development plan. SESCO capitalizes
interest during construction for projects not completed within one year.
22.       Further Borrowings are those loans not currently committed but
required--beginning in 1993--to finance SESCO's projected investment program.
23.       Short Term Deposits are projected to decrease as SESCO uses its
excess liquidity to finance its development program through 1992.
Balance Sheet
24.       Gross Fixed Assets are revalued as of December 31, 1986, and have
been projected on a revalued basis thereafter, adopting the escalation rates
shown in para. 6. The revaluation of assets as of December 31, 1986 is based
on a revaluation exercise carried out by C.H. Williams, Talhar, Wong and Yeo
(Surveyors, Malaysia) as of December 31, 1983. For 1984-86, the assets were
revalued according to the COM fixed assets deflator for those years.
25.       Work in Progress in each year is increased by the capital investment
for that year. It is assumed that 40% of work in progress is taken into gross
fixed assets after one year and 60% after two years.
26.       Cash is projected to increase from 1986 levels at the rate of
inflation.
27.       Inventories for capital projects are assumed to vary proportionally
with capital investments.
28.       Inventories for O&M, presently about 5.2% of gross fixed assets, are
projected to increase in a decreasing proportion with gross fixed assets.
That ratio is expected to fall gradually to 4.0% of gross fixed assets in 1992
and to remain at that level thereafter.
29.       Accounts Receivables are expected to be 90 days of sales in 1987.
They are projected to drop to 75 days of sales in 1988, and to decline further
in 1998 to 60 days of sales, where they will remain through 1996.
30.       Advances and Prepaid Expenses are projected to increase at the rate
of inflation.
31.       Equity is projected assuming no further subscription of share
capital by the State Government through 1996.
32.       Gross Capital Contributions are increased each year by consumer
capital contributions and government grants for rural electrification, both
shown in the funds flow statement.

33.       Contribution Suspense Account reflects consumer coiitributions for
work in progress. Contributions are transferred from the suspense account to
the capital contribution account as the relevant distribution systems, for
which the contributions were made, are completed.
34.       Deferred Foreign Exchange Account.  Under the accounting practice
currently adopted by SESCO, loans repayable in .oreign currencies are
translated into Malaysian dollars at the rate of exchange ruling on the last
day of each year increases resulting from obligations for future principal
repayments are debited to the Deferred Foreign Exchange Account, with losses
arising from translation of the current portion of the foreign loans charged
directly to Revenue Account. The accumulated losses in respect of all foreign
loans outstanding as of December 31, 1986 included in the Deferred Foreign
Exchange Account totalled M$214.4 million; as of November 30, 1987, the figure
was M$254.0 million. The financial projections assume that during the period
1988-96, the revenue account will bear a loss of M$120.3 million and the
Deferred Foreign Exchange Account will be reduced to M$133.7 million. No
further devaluation of the Malaysian dollar is assumed in the financial
projections.
35.       Accounts Payable are projected to increase proportionally with
SESCO's fuel and other cash operating expenses.
36.       Consumer Deposits are projected to increase at 5Z annually.

ANNEX 10
MALAYSIA
SARAWAK POWER PROJECT
Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
Economic rate of return was calculated for (a) SESCO's entire
investment program during 1988-2001 (Table 1); and (b) the combined cycle
power plant assuming the entire transmission cost is associated with the plant
(Table 2). It is noted that the investment program, used in the first case,
includes components for power generation as well as transmission and
distribution. Incremental sales are associated with these components and
start at a very low level in the first year of the program due to the
utilization of some parts of the distribution component.
