SUBJECT:   Project Completion Report on Malaysia
Sarawak Power Project (Loan 2942-MA)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Malaysia - Sarawak Power Project (Loan 2942-
MA) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
This was the first Bank assistance to the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation. The
US$56.0 million loan cofinanced the first gas-fired power plant in the country after the government
decided to implement the sector study which recommended a shift from coal to gas as the least-cost
power generation alternative as well as gas pricing guidelines.
'he Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) implemented the project successfully
by undergoing the necessary staff training and by relying on consultants' technical assistance for
engineering back-up. It also selected only highly qualified contractors for civil works and made
suppliers responsible for installing their equipments.
Project risks were correctly identified and limited supervision was required (only three
missions). The loan covenants were met, most notably the rate of return on revalued assets (above
8%). Some improvements in accounting, accounts receivable management and management
information system increased further SESCO's efficiency.
T'he PCR gives a satisfactory account of project implementation and results. The project
outcome is rated as highly satisfactory, its sustainability as likely, and its institutional impact as
substantial.
The project may be audited Lo learn more about factors of good performance in the physical,
policy and institutional areas spanned by the project.

SARAWAK POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2942-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Sarawak Power
Project for which Loan 2942-MA in the amount of US$56.0 million was approved
on May 24, 1988.
The Loan is currently scheduled to be closed on June 30, 1994. By
the end of September 1992, US$48.33 million equivalent had been disbursed from
the Loan. The remaining amount, consisting mainly of retention money, is
expected to be fully disbursed before the current closing date. Some
differences between Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) and
equipment suppliers regarding guarantee obligations must be settled before the
remaining funds are disbursed.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Division of Country
Department 1 of the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III). The Borrower, SESCO, prepared Part II which has
been included in the PCR without editing or other alteration.
Preparation of this PCR started in October 1992 after a PCR mission
to Sarawak, Malaysia and is based on inter alia, the Staff Appraisal Report,
the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, supervision reports and correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower.

SARAWAK POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2942-MA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
1.        The objectives of the project were to utilize Sarawak's natural gas
resources to meet electricity demand in the state, to enhance operational
efficiency through system integration, and to strengthen the institutional
capabilities of the Sarawak Electricity Supply Corporation (SESCO) in the
areas of system planning, engineering design and accounting (Part I, para.
3.1).
Implementation Experience
2.        The project was implemented successfully.  In fact, it can be
concluded that the project was planned and executed in an exemplary manner.
The successful implementation can be attributed to: (a) SESCO's strong
emphasis on staff training; (b) the extensive engineering back-up of an
experienced expatriate engineering consortium; (c) the practice of having
major equipment suppliers be responsible for the installation of their
equipment and ancillaries; and (d) the selecting of only highly qualified
contractors for civil works and other tasks assigned to local firms (Part I,
paras. 5.1 and 5.2).
Results
3.        SESCO's performance on the project was very satisfactory and the
project was completed on time. The timely project implementation made it
possible for SESCO to meet its chief objective of utilizing Sarawak's natural
gas resources in time to supply the state's growing demand for electricity.
The efficiency improvement components were carried out successfully (Part I,
paras. 6.1 and 6.2).
4.        The project is financially and economically sound.  Since FY88
SESCO has been earning a return on its average net fixed assets under the
historic cost convention in excess of 8 percent. The 22 percent reevaluated
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) for the project compares favorably
with the SAR estimate of 20 percent (Part III, paras. 6.5, and 7.1).



- iii -
Sustainabilitv
5.        Sustainability of the project appears assured because of:  (a) an
adequate market for electric power at a satisfactory price; (b) an ample
supply of natural gas; and (c) the high technological standard of SESCO's
physical plant and good operating and maintenance skills of its staff (Part I,
para. 7.1).
Findings and Lessons Learned
6.        SESCO was given a demanding schedule for implementing the power
project. A time span of four years was allowed for completing the imple-
mentation cycle, including system design and engineering, procurement,
construction, testing and commissioning. SESCO completed the project within
the 48 month time limit. This notable performance was made possible by
SESCO's thorough training program and the foresight to obtain high-quality
consulting help. The project illustrates that a combination of staff training
and professional assistance is a valuable asset for successful project
implementation (Part I, para. 9.2).

PART I. PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.        Proiect Identity
Project Name:               Sarawak Power Project
Loan No:                    2942-MA
RVP Unit:                   East Asia and Pacific
Country:                    Malaysia
Sector:                     Energy
Subsector:                  Electric Power
2.        Background
2.1       The Fifth Development Plan prepared by the Government in 1984-85
proposed a diversification strategy in the energy sector through a 'Four Fuel
Policy", basing future development on a mix of oil, gas, hydro and coal. This
strategy translated into plans to: (a) construct the 2,400 MW Bakun hydro-
electric project costing about US$6 billion; (b) utilize imported coal to
supply part of the energy requirements of the industrial sector and to fuel
1,200 MW of new power plants at Port Klang; and (c) develop gas resources for
power and industrial use by the early 1990s. In 1986 the Bank was asked by
tha Economic Planning Unit (EPU) to undertake a comprehensive review of the
Malaysian power sector. The Bank's study (Report No. 6466-MA) concluded that:
(a) the eco.aomic cost of gas would be substantially lower than earlier
assumptions; (b) such low-cost gas would render the Bakun hydro project and
power plants burning imported coal economically unviable; and (c) the least-
cost power development during the next 15 years would principally be the
addition of gas-based generation. The sector study also made recommendations
on pricing of gas to the power sector. The Government and concerned entities
fully accepted the recommendations of the sector report and took a decision to
postpone the Bakun project and cancel plans for the addition of 600 MW coal
fired units at Port Klang. The recommended gas pricing policy was also
accepted. The development plans of the three utilities: the National
Electricity Board (NEB), now Tenaga Nasional Berhad; the Sarawak Electricity
Supply Corporation (SESCO); and the Sabah Electricity Board (SEB) were
reoriented from hydro and coal generation to gas-fired generation primarily
based on the high efficiency combined cycle technology. SESCO was in
particular receptive to the recommendations of the sector study.

3.        Prolect Objective and Organization
3.1       The objectives of the project were to utilize Sarawak's natural gas
resources to meet electricity demand in the state, to enhance operational
efficiency through system integration, and to strengthen the institutional
capabilities of SESCO in the areas of system planning, engineering design and
accounting.
3.2       The project included the following components:
(a)  the first phase (2 x 30 MW gas turbine generator sets) of a 90 MW
combined-cycle gas-fired power station at Bintulu;
(b)  185 km of double circuit, 275 kV transmission line from Bintulu to
Sibu with associated substations;
(c)  a regional load dispatch center at Bintulu;
(d)  consulting services for engineering of the power station,
transmission line and substations, and architectural and
engineering services for civil works; and
(e)  efficiency improvement through:
(i) a gas utilization study;
(ii) upgrading of SESCO's system planning and engineering design
capabilities through acquisition of modern computer hardware,
planning software and training of staff; and
(iii)  consultancy assistance for strengthening SESCO's accounting and
office practices.
4.        Project Design and Organization
4.1       The design of the major project component, power generation and
transmission was optimal in concept and execution. It was based on what has
since become the cornerstone for power development following the results of
the Bank's 1987 sector study. The study concluded that natural gas-based
generation was the least-cost solution to power generation for the next
15 years. Although only the open cycle turbines were planned to be installed
in the first phase, the project concept and layout were based on ultimate
conversion to the more efficient combined-cycle operation. Project design was
optimized by selection of the plant site which took maximum advantage of
access to cooling water and gas supply and soil bearing properties.
4.2       The original plan for establishing a regional load dispatch center
in Bintulu comprised a dual computer system with data-link to Kuching's State
Dispatch Center. SESCO, at its own initiative, substantially modified this
plan with the approval of the Bank. It eliminated the two computers at
Bintulu, using instead spare capacity at Kuching. The Kuching computers are
able to perform this added duty without interfering with their required SCADA
functions.



- 3 -
4.3       The project design also took into account SESCO's institutional
needs. Consultancy assistance included in the project was selected with the
objective of upgrading and strengthening SESCO's institutional capability.
Results have shown that these objectives were achieved.
5.        Proiect Implementation
5.1       Primary responsibility for implementation of the project rested
with SESCO. It was closely assisted by expatriate consultants in all
implementation steps ranging from basic engineering to construction super-
vision and plant start-up. Plant equipment was mostly installed by the
respective suppliers, and local contractors performed the civil works and
other tasks more readily handled by local firms.
5.2       Project implementation was well planned and efficiently executed.
Part III, para. 4.1 shows the close agreement between key scheduling targets
and actual achievements. A large share of the credit for the excellent
implementation performance is attributed by SESCO to its effective training
program. SESCO also makes it a practice to have all consultants carry out
their assignments at SESCO facilities (and not at the consultants' home
locations). This provides for maximum exposure to the consultants' work and
offers opportunity for on-the-job training.
6.        Prolect Results
6.1       SESCO's performance on the project was very satisfactory and the
project was completed on time. The timely project implementation made it
possible for SESCO to meet its chief objective of utilizing Sarawak's natural
gas resources in time to supply the state's growing demand for electricity.
Although the overall variance between actual and estimated project cost is
only 9 percent, there was a 55 percent overrun on the cost associated with the
substation and 28 percent with the gas turbine generation power station. The
actual costs of switchgears, transformers and the gas turbine generating plant
have increased dramatically during project implementation due to the very
tight international market situation for these items, particularly for gas
turbines.
6.2       The efficiency improvement components of the project were also
carried out in a timely and expeditious manner as summarized below:
(a) Gas Utilization Study. The study was carried out on behalf of the
Government by the Economic Planning Unit (EPU). The study was
completed on schedule and is expected to provide the basis for
planning of gas-based industries in Malaysia.
(b) Upgrading of SESCO's Power System Planning and Design Capabilities.
SESCO's achievement in this area has been mainly concerned with
acquiring computer software and hardware and training its staff in
its use. The Bank has recommended that with the coming of powerful
desktop computers, SESCO should consider acquiring more
sophisticated generation planning software along with appropriate
training for its staff.



- 4 -
(c) Strengthening of SESCO's Accounting and Office Practices.
Consultants have prepared an accounting procedures manual for
SESCO. The manual lays down procedures covering accounting and
office practices and SESCO is finding them very useful.
6.3       The project is economically and financially sound.  SESCO's
financial performance is summarized in para. 6.11, Part III and the
accompanying table. The reevaluated IEER of the project at 22 percent
compares favorably with the SAR estimate of 20 percent. The higher rate of
return is in large measure due to realization of full sales of electricity
from the project about two years ahead of assumptions in the SAR analysis.
7.        Project Sustainability
7.1       The project benefits should be sustainable for the 30-year life of
the project facilities. The principal reasons are:
(a) The projected market for power and the price structure are expected
to develop as planned.
(b) The giant natural gas field which supplies SESCO's natural gas
(and also large-scale users such as urea, petrochemicals and LNG
producers) has ample proven reserves to meet current demand --
25 trillion (1012), cubic feet equivalent to about a 70 year supply
at the present 1,100 MMCFD production rate. It can be assumed that
the Government will not allow sales and production to increase to
the point of endangering present supply contracts. Furthermore,
active exploration has the potential of finding additional proven
reserves.
(c) The project's physical plant is of the best technology and quality
currently available. This along with SESCO staff's operating and
maintenance skills should ensure a satisfactory project life span.
8.        Bank Performance
8.1       The project was the Bank's first energy lending operation with
SESCO. However, the Bank had previous contact with SESCO during the energy
study conducted by the Bank at the Government's request. A main objective of
the study was to review and evaluate the "Four Fuels Policy" introduced with
the 1984-85 Development Plan. It was intended that the plan would establish
a development strategy based on power generation by the use of diverse fuels,
namely coal, oil, gas and hydro. The Bank study was completed in January
1987. Its findings completely altered the fuel selection for future
development. Prime preference for the near future was to be given to natural
gas to take advantage of the low cost of this fuel and the high efficiency of
the combined cycle generation made possible by its use.
8.2       A direct result of the new fuel policy was to postpone the hydro
projects at Bakun and Ulu Ai in favor of the gas-fired unit financed by the
Bank. The Bank found that SESCO and its consultants were fully qualified for
the preparation and design of the technical project components. However, the
Bank did see a need for strengthening SESCO's institutional capabilities and



improving its operational efficiency The§4 items were included in the
project scope and successfully imp tmented.
8.3       The Bank satisfactorily supervised the loan.  SESCO's
implementation capability along with the strong back-up of its consultants and
the informative quarterly progress reports made only minimal supervision
necessary. The Bank found that only four supervision visits were necessary
during 1989 to 1991, the three most active years of the project.
9.        Borrower's Performance
9.1       SESCO has developed into a well operated and managed electric power
utility with a competent motivated staff. It readily responded to the Bank's
recommendations for increasing its operating efficiency and institutional
capabilities. The result has been that SESCO's execution and operation of the
project facilities are of a high quality, both in terms of managerial and
technical standards. Considering its human resource development program and
the emphasis on training, it can be assumed that SESCO will be able to deal
successfully with the growing size and complexity of its existing and future
installations.
9.2       SESCO was given a demanding schedule for implementing the power
project. A time span of four years was allowed for completing the imple-
mentation cycle, including system design and engineering, procurement,
construction, testing and commissioning. SESCO completed the project within
the 48 month time limit. This notable performance was made possible by
SESCO's thorough training program and the foresight to obtain high-quality
consulting help. The project illustrates that a combination of staff training
and professional assistance is a valuable asset for successful project
implementation.
10.       Proiect Relationship
10.1      As far as could be determined the project experienced no serious
relationship problems among those associated with the project. Bank staff
remained on good terms with SESCO and government officials and with
consultants it came into contact with during implementation of the project.
SESCO also appears to have remained on good terms with its consultants,
contractors and suppliers.
11.       Consulting Services
11.1      SESCO engaged consultants to carry out the services noted below.
According to SESCO all consulting services were performed satisfactorily.
Consulting services were engaged for:
(a)  engineering for the power station, transmission line and
substations;
(b)  architectural works and civil engineering for minor civil
structures;
(c)  a gas utilization study;



- 6 -
(d) upgrading of SESCO's power system planning and design capabilities;
and
(a) strengthening of accounting and office practices.
12.       Project Documentation and Data
12.1      The Staff Appraisal Report and President's Report were
comprehensive and well documented. They gave a thorough account of the
institutional and sector backgrounds to the project and its objectives. The
legal documents provided the necessary legal framework for project
implementation and agreements reached by the Bank with the Government and
SESCO.
12.2      The Bank prepared informative supervision reports, but their
infrequency created some gaps in up-to-date information on implementation
progress. SESCO produced nine quarterly reports which contained much
information on contract prices, loan disbursement and similar items. These
data (including supervision reports) have furnished adequate material for the
preparation of PCRs.
12.3      Data for this PCR were obtained from documents, reports and
correspondence in Bank files. A Bank mission was required to acquire
financial and economic data needed to complete the PCR.

3.       Loan Disbursements
3.1       The following table shows the relationship between actual
disbursements and the amounts estimated at appraisal. The table also shows
the disbursement profile of past power projects in the Asia Region. It was
expected that the Loan will be fully disbursed before the June 30, 1994
closing date. Funds still to be disbursed consist almost entirely of
retention money which SESCO is withholding pending resolution of differences
over a number of equipment guarantees. SESCO does not expect any major
difficulty in settling this matter.

5.1       Although the overall variance between actual and estimated project
cost is only 9 percent, there was a 55 percent overrun on the cost associated
with the substation and 28 percent with the gas turbine generation power
station. The actual costs of switchgears, transformers and the gas turbine
generating plant have increased dramatically during project implementation due
to the very tight international market situation for these items, particularly
for gas turbines.
6.        Financial Performance
6.1       SESCO's financial performance comparing actual results with project
appraisal forecasts is presented in Annexes 1, 2 and 3 and summarized in the

6.2       SESCO's  financial performance improved steadily over the years.
Between FY87 and FY91, total power sold increased by 54%, growing at 11% on
average during the period and comparing favorably with the 41% increase
projected during appraisal of the project. As a result of improved
electricity sales, total operating income also increased by over 9%. While
operating income was fairly stable during the period, non-operating income
varied significantly from one year to the next, particularly gains and losses
from foreign exchange transactions. These fluctuations had a significant
effect on SESCO's profitability. In 1989, SESCO reported a profit of M$115
million on the strength of a foreign exchange gain of about M$78 million.
However, in 1990, although electricity sales increased by 13% and operating
profit was at 37% of revenues, SESCO posted a net loss for the first and only
time of M$ll million due to huge foreign exchange losses of about M$54
million.
6.3       SESCO's  foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at
the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with all differences included
in the profit and loss account. It shows losses in its books under a Foreign
Exchange Deferred Account which are written off to revenue when payments of
the loan installments are made. The Bank has criticized the drawbacks of the
accounting treatment and has suggested that SESCO consider writing off the
deferred losses against retained earnings in one lump sum or spreading the
losses over the remaining terms of the loans to even out the effect of the
exchange rate fluctuations on the net income of any given year. SESCO has
already introduced changes in its accounting policy with regard to treatment
of fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, it has also practiced foreign
exchange liabilities management with a view to avoiding risk of further
foreign exchange losses. In FY92, SESCO has arranged a defeasance for three
of its more expensive foreign loans. The technique is designed to mitigate
exchange risk by buying currencies and investing them in instruments of the
same currencies and maturity to match with the repayment of the long term
debt. The yields from the investments will be used to repay the principal and
interests of the loans.j,'
6.4       The Loan Agreement enjoins SESCO to earn for each of its fiscal
years an annual rate of return of no less than 8% on the average net value of
its revalued fixed assets in operation. However, SESCO's accounts were
prepared under the historic cost convention without any revaluation of assets.
During the project implementation period (1987-91), SESCO's networth
registered an increase of 88% exclusive of revaluation reserves, against the
forecasted figure of 61% during appraisal. On the basis of asset valuation
using historical costs, SESCO earned a return on average net fixed assets of
12% in FY88; 10% in FY89; 9% in FY90 and 8% in FY91. SESCO informed the Bank
that it has concluded its asset revaluation exercise in FY92 but since the
I/  An irrevocable trust placement of Norwegian Kroner (NKR) 16.9 million to
be used solely for satisfying scheduled payments of both interest and
principal of a NKR 19.0 million loan at 8.75% with A/S Eksportfinans; a
deposit of M$15.1 million pledged to Midland Bank to repay a M$23 million loan
with Svenska Handelbanken; and another fixed deposit at Union Bank of
Switzerland to repay the same M$20.6 (Swiss Franc 10.2 million) loan at 7%.

revaluation was only booked in FY92, it was not able to reflect its assets
reserves/surplus on a revalued basis for the previous years accounts. In
FY92, the accounts of SESCO were prepared under the historical cost
convention and modified to include the revaluation of certain fixed assets.
The fixed assets of M$1.8 billion included assets which have been revalued by
a professional firm based on the open market value in 1989. The net surplus
on revaluation of M$93.6 million for land and buildings were transferred to
revaluation reserves.
6.5       The FY92 rate of return on average revalued net fixed assets was
calculated at 10%. The rate of return rose from 8% in 1991 to 10% in 1992
inspite of the increased amount of average assets brought about by the
revaluation exercise because of SESCO's improved financial operations.
Operating revenues increased by 20%, while operating expenses increased only
marginally (3%) in 1992. Generation expenses were reduced from M$107 million
in 1991 to M$99 million in 1992. The effect was an operating income for the
year of M$127 million, 53% higher than the 1991 figure.
6.6       During the period, SESCO has maintained the debt service coverage
at more than 1.3 times required in the Loan Agreement, except for FY89 when
the debt service coverage was 1.2 times. The Loan covenants also prohibit
SESCO from contracting any new term debt, if such debt would raise total debt
to more than 60% of the sum of its equity plus total debt. Since FY89,
SESCO's debt to debt plus equity ratio has continously been lower than 60%.
6.7       SESCO has been concerned about its high accounts receivable
situation and has monitored and focused on this issue during project
implementation. As a result of various steps taken by SESCO as stipulated in
the Action Plan, its accounts receivable position has improved and by mid-
1992, days receivable had gone down from a previous high of 95 days sales in
1985, to 62 days sales, comparing favorably with the projected 60 days sales
for the period at appraisal.
7.        Economic Analysis
7.1       The project's economic internal rate of return is calculated for
the actual installation of 4x32.4 MW gas turbine sets compared to 4x30 MW sets
in the SAR. The long term generation from these sets is assumed to be about
732 Gwh per annum, based on actual sales in 1993 and SESCO's forecast; this
implies operation of the sets at an annual plant factor of about 64%, compared
to 62% in the SAR. In deriving electricity sales, the overall system loss is
assumed to be 18%, as in the SAR. This is a conservative assumption in view
of concerted efforts by SESCO to reduce system losses (para. 8 B(2)). All
costs are in 1993 price levels; deflation factors from 1988 to 1993 are
presented in Annex 4. While SESCO has been able to supply actual disbursement
figures for the costs of generation and transmission associated with the
project, it has not been able to provide the distribution system costs that
should be allocated to the project. It has, therefore, been necessary to
assume the same distribution costs as in the SAR (in 1993 price levels).
Although actual O&M costs for generating plant have been low in the years 1992
and 1993, higher values commensurate with SAR figures are used from 1994 on-
wards. Transmission and distribution O&M costs are assumed at 1.0% and 1.8%
respectively of the capital investments, based on SESCO's experience.

Although the sale price of gas to SESCO is fixed at M$2.7/MMBTU till the year
2001, the economic price of gas is assumed to be M$2.7/MMBTU for 1993 and is
escalated at 5% per annum in real terms thereafter. The plant heat rate is
about 13,000 BTU/kWh. Revenue from sales of electricity (which is used as a
proxy for the project's benefits and is the lower bound of consumer willing-
ness to pay) is computed on the basis of actual average revenue of M$0.29/kWh
in 1993. This figure is maintained constant in real terms for the duration of
the project. The details of the analysis are presented in Annex 4. The
reevaluated economic internal rate of return is about 22% which is close to
the SAR figure of 20%. The higher rate of return is in large measure due to
realization of full sales of electricity from the project about two years
ahead of assumptions in the SAR analysis.
