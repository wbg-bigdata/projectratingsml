              land prices in Nam Dinh province in 2010.
 9.         The land law of 2007 provides for the assignment of land to people by land use right which
            bears close similarities to individual property. Some of the important issues relevant to land
            usage, acquisition can be summaries as follows:
             The State reserves the right to allocate land and determine its usage.
             Families and individuals who have been assigned with land have the right to exchange their
              land for another piece; transfer their land use right to another party, and rent, bequeath and
              use their land as collateral.
             The People's committees at all levels (Province, District and commune) are responsible for
              the administration of land use in their localities; the People's Committees at all levels are
              responsible for managing land within their domain.
             The State reserves the right to expropriate land if necessary, in case of national defense or
              security, or national and public interest. In these cases, the land users are compensated for
              loss of possessions. The "national and public interest is defined in Go V Decree No.
                                                                         11


              19712004IND-CP dated 3rd December 2004 which includes infrastructure projects.
10.         Before land is recovered, the land users must be informed of the reason for expropriation,
            time schedule and plan for relocation and options for compensation (if necessary),

                   11.2.       World Bank policy on involuntary resettlement
11.         Involuntary resettlement under development projects, if unmitigated, often give rise to severe
            economic, social, and environmental risks: production systems are dismantled; damages on
            material and immaterial property (housing, land, forest resources, cultural sites, properties of


                                                                                                     Page 6

            commercial value, social and cultural activities) are inflicted. Such effects can be either
            temporary. or permanent. Thus the World Bank policy regulated by OP/BP 4.12 includes
            safeguards to address and mitigate these risks
12.         The basic guiding principle of the World Bank resettlement policy is that:
             Involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all
              viable alternative project designs.
             Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be conceived
              and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment
              resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project benefits.
              Displaced persons should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to
              participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs.
             Displaced persons need assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards
              of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels
              prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.
                   11.3.        Policies applied by RRD-RWSS
13.         The resettlement policy applied for RRD - RWSS will be harmonious between World Bank
            reqUirements (safeguards policy 4.12) and Vietnamese laws and regulations. The principles
            in the project resettlement policy include:
             All project affected people, regardless of their owner situation social economic position, will
              be reasonably compensated, and supported for their loss of assets, income and business
              according to the replacement prices and given suitable resettlement measures, in order to
              assist in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards of living or at least restore
              their living standards, income and production capacity to pre-displacement levels.
             Land prices for calculating damage compensations (compensation, support) are
              determined closely with the actual transferred land use right price in the market at normal
              conditions. When there are differences from the actual transferred land use right price, land
              prices for calculating damage compensations shall be appropriately adjusted.
             Compensation for affected dwelling houses and construction sites according to the new
              construction value of damaged dwelling houses and construction sites having technical
              standards equal to dwelling houses are made without disca/culate for salvage raw materials
              or depreciation.
             People who, lived, worked and had their assets attached to project affected areas or
              suffered from other damages caused by project implementation prior to the cut-of-date are
              entitled to compensation (compensation, support).
             Resettlement assessment monitoring is regularly executed with the participation of affeoted
              persons.
       III. PROJECT AFFECTED SCOPE AND INHABITANT STATUS
14.         In recent years, urban and rural area of Nam Dinh province have many innovations as well as
            the development of other provinces in the country. The living standard of people in rural area
            is better and better. Their demand of infrastructure improvement including clean water supply
            and sanitation are necessary. Water supply and sanitation sub-project covering rural
            communes in Nam Dinh province will make the satisfied condition for socio-economic

15.         The size of Water supply and sanitation sub-projects (RRD-WSSP) is commune or inter,.
            commune. The pumping station, water tower and water treatment plant have to acquire land
            for construction. The delivery and service pipe system is planed to install in road and there is
            no effect by land acquisition. Locations of the pumping Station, water tank and water treatment
            Plant were considered carefully basing on appropriate technology solution and reducing the
            effect by land acquisition to household. Most of area of recovered land for construction is
            public land and under administration of commune authority. So, scale affected area by sub-
            project is small. There are total of 06 households in 03 communes whose agricultural land will
            be recovered and 01 household whose crop plant will be affected. 100% of DH also enjoys
            official involvement form project.
