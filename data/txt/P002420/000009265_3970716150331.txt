The purpose of an environmental impact assess-
ment, EIA, is to evaluate, whether existing or
proposed activities might have adverse effects on
the surrounding environment or on the human util-
isation thereof.
An EIA is generally structured in the following
way:
- description: the environment around the site
or area in focus, section 15.1,
-  evaluation:   present  and  expected   future
sources of pollution, and how they might af-
fect the environment, section 15.2,
recommendations: mitigation measures to reduce
such adverse effects, section 15.3.
Pollution can be defined as 'the introduction ny
man, directly or indirectly,  of substances  or
energy into the environment resulting in such
deleterious effects as harm to living resources,
hazards to human health, hindrance to activities,
impairment of quality for use of land or sea and
reduction of amenities'.

15.1.1  Introduction         In this section the basic characteristics of the
nature around Freetown Port is described.
The environmental conditions of the marine en-
vironment off the West African coast in general
and around Sierra Leone especially have been
treated in some reports in recent years, see re-
ferences /18/, /19/ and /20/. /22/ deals with the
flora of the marine bottom, and /21/ outlines the
flora and fauna of the Sierra Leone River estu-
ary. Some reports focus on the pollution problems
that especially the river and estuary is facing
/21/, /23/, /24/ and /2s/.
The coastline facing the Atlantic around the es-
tuary is to the north characterised by extensive
mud banks with areas of swamps and mangroves.
South of the estuary the Peninsula is bordered by
alternating rocks and sandy beaches.

Except for the Peninsula. where Freetown is situ-

deeply indented by creeks and rivers entering the
estuary. Therefore the coastline of the estuary
is very long.
15.1.2 Climate and
Hydrogrqphy         Sierra Leone is situated in the Equatorial Hlmid
Zone. The climate is characterised by the north-
east trade winds. When blowing from Sahara These
winds are called the Harmattan. This wind domi-
nates mainly during the winter, and reach its
southern limit in March. Consequently the dry
season in the Freetown area is from December to
March. The monsoon, the humid south westerlies,
brings the rainstorm from May to November with

The off-shore sea-water circulation is dominated
by the Equatorial counter current with some in-
fluence by the Canary current during the dry sea-
son, see Figure 15.13. Sierra Leone in situated
just to the south of the North African up-welling
zone in which nutrient rich deep water is brought
to the surface layers during October to April. In
the. Freetown estuary, however, the water quality
seems to be dominated by seasonal fluctuations in
the flow rates of the river discharges, see be-
low.
In. the estuary the water depths vary between a
few meters at Middle Ground in the northern part
of the entrance, to 5 to 10 meters in large parts
of the estuary, and up to approx. 30 meters in a
channel that enters the estuary along the Free-
town coast.
The tidal amplitude is from 1 to 3 meters at
lowest neap and highest spring respectively. The
'   I~                                         current speed varies from less than 1 knot in the
*   n                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~dry season at neap flood to 5 knot during the wet
season at spring ebb.
In the Freetown area three water masses are d s-
tinguished:
. *                                                   - bay water, in the bays along the shores of
Freetown,
- estuary water, extends from the bays to about
250 meters off shore,
I..                                        - oceanic water, extends from midstream to the
|   ]                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~northe-rn shores.
Bottom conditions: The bottom of the estuary con-
sists of areas of mud, silt or sand. These de-
posits are more of less unconsolidated, and this
results in rapid redistribution of the sediments
caused by the tidal streams.
15.1.3  Water Quality        Temperature and salinity:
Situated in a tropical climate, the temperature
of the waters of the estuary fluctuates very
little seasonally. In both the surface waters and
in the bottom waters temperatures vary from ap-
prox. 27 CO to approx. 28 CO. The variations in
the salinity is considerable, which is often cha-
racteristic of estuaries. The variations in the
Sierra Leone River are to the greater part at-
tributed to the fluctuations in river run-off
between the dry and the rainy season. In the
Freetown area, variations are from 34 o/oo during
the dry season to approx. 29 o/oo during the wet
season. In the central part of the estuary a
marked difference between the surface and bottom
water salinities is observed during the rainy
season. The salinities in the bottom waters are

going down to 16-20 /0o in the central areas
and down to 10 o/oo in :the inner parts.
Turbidity:
Turbidity is variable, and it is greatest during
the rainy season. Throughout the year the turbid-
ity is greater at springs than at neaps.
Oxygen and nutrients and plankton:
No marXed depletion in the oxygen content of the
waters have been observed. The oxygen content of
the bottom water is often lower than in the sur-
face layers. This has been attributed to the
breakdown of organic matter at the bottom of the
estuary.
Inorganic plant nutrient:
The amount of phosphorus and the nitrate/nitrite
varies with the season. From a minimum in and
around February the concentration is built up
until the onset of the dry season in November/
December, when the phytoplankton bloom sets in.
This bloom is using up all the nutrients leading
to the February minimum. The phytoplankton bloom
is also followed by increasing amounts of zoo-
plankton that forms the food basis for the large
amounts of Bonga and sardines, that enter the
estuary during the dry season.
15.1.4  Flora and Fauna     The estuary with its bordering mangroves is a
very productive ecosystem. The nutrient-rich bot-
tom of the estuary holds large amounts of mol-
luscs, crustaceans and polychaetes (sea-worms).
They serve as food for numerous birds and demer-
sal (living at the bottom) fishes. On the aerial
roots of the mangrove, dense populations of
oysters are found.
Together with many other species, the juveniles
of the commercially important shrimps, including
the pink shrimp and the tiger shrimp, use the mud
flats among the mangrove as nursery grounis. Here
the water depths are less than 1 meter. Later
they move to the deeper parts of the estuary, and
as adults they migrate to the sea to spawn. The
drifting larvae then return to the estuary.
The seasonality in the plankton production is
reflected in the lives of several commercial
fishes. Most demersal fishes living in the estu-
ary breed during the dry season, so the drifting
larvae can take advantage of the abundant amounts
of pLankton as food. The awefu/bonga migrate into
the estuary during this season. Also the spent
sardines and their newly hatched juveniles mi-
grate to the richness of the estuary.

As described, mangroves provide the basis for
several ways of exploitation by the population
living around the estuary.
In summary, mangroves are important parts of the
nature in several respects:
- rich habitats for many pilants, fishes, birds
and other organisms;
- highly productive areas for fishing and aqua-
culture;
- source of fire-wood;
- coastal protection.

Vicinity            Data on environmental conditions specifically for
Freetown Port are sparse. This section presents
information that has been collected in the port
and its vicinity. An evaluation of the state of

Diving inspection along the quay:
The submarine walls of the quays were inspected
by SCUBA-diving, and notes were made of the flora
and fauna. The findings are described in detail
4                                                    together with photos in /2/. The general findings
are shown in Figure 15.1C. The figure shows that
the walls from the low-water mark and almost to
the bottom are covered by hydroids, octocorals
and sponges, The hydroids (small colonial polyp
animals) are slightly covered by a layer of silt.

oyster shells could be seen.
Apart from obvious garbage, no visible sign of
pollution was observed on the sea bottom.
All along the quays were several species of fish-
es observed, single or in small schools.
Some observations in the intertidal zone in the
vicinity of Freetown was conducted from a small
boat:
- on the rocks along LEOCEM no oil pollution was
observed,
;                                          - on a free-standing mooring post at the en-
trance to the marine slipway, hydroids and
calcareous worms were seen. No visible oil,

-  at the oil-jetty at the,storage tanks: from
low-water and approx. 2. meter up barnacles
were forming a band and above these and fur-
ther two metres up, probably to the high-water
level, a band of large and live oysters were
seen. No oil film on the water nor on the
piles.
Further south-east of Freetown down to Wellington
the coast has only very sparse occurrence of man-
grove, and in general only very little is left of
the vegetation in this coastal zone.
From Wellington and up the Bunce River the man-
grove grows thicker. Dense populations of oysters
were observed on the roots of the mangrove, and
people were collecting oysters at low tide on the
mud flats. Many different species of birds were
noted foraging on the mud flats, among these
terns. 4 species of egrets and herons and an
r'     ^   '                                           osprey.
In recent years investigations have been con-
ducted on the pollution state of the bay and near
shore waters from Cape Sierra Leone to Welling-
r                                                      ton, /15.5-15.8/.  In summary the conclusion of
these works are the following:
-  the  concentrations  of  the  plant  nutrients
phosphates and nitrate/nitrite are very low,
-  in the bay water off the central parts of
Freetown the BOD  (the biological oxygen de-
mand, which is one way of expressing the orga-
CL                                                        nic load)  and the concentrations of faecal
coliform bacteria are  high. This  indicates
that these waters  are  loaded with  organic
matters and human waste.

15.2    POTE sL SODRCES
OF POLLUTON         A general review of the pollution problems in the
West African waters is given in /18/ and /19/.
Within the Freecown Port area four possible
sources of pollution may be recognised: 1) Indu-
stry, 2) Built-up area including workshops and
shipyard, 3) Ships and 4) Dredging. Also potenti-
al sources outside the port should be considered.
These sources may pollute the air, the land area
and the marine environment (the fresh water en-
vironment is not considered in this context). and
may affect public health.
The present state of discharges and the potential
sources of pollution within the port are evalu-
;                                                    ated based on existing information, site visits
and discussions with the authorities. It should
be noted chat if properly handled, discharges and
releases need not lead to pollution.

15.2.1 Present Sources
within the Port     - industry:
There is relatively little industry in the
Freetown area. In the port area there is the
Flower Mill and LEOCEK is situated between the
main port area and the shipyard. Some dust may
arise from the loading/unloading at the Flower
Mill, but not to an extent that is considered
serious. The dust from the unloading of clin-
kers to LEOCEM may at times have bothering
effects in the residential area depending upon
the wind direction. In Ghana. GHACEM is
looking into the solution to this problem by
adding spraying devices along the transport
system.
- built-up areas:
The total number of staff and workers in the
port area varies with the activities in the
port; on the average about 2,300 persons are
occupied in the port. This number of people
naturally gives rise to a proportionate. amount
of sewage and solid waste. The lavatories
drain into the outlet west of the port, and
the toilets are connected to septic tanks.
that are emptied by bowsers from the city
council. Garbage bins and containers are
placed in the port area for the solid waste.
Pipes from the Cline Town Health Centre empty
via a malfunctioning disintegrator at the
quay.
Very little oil was observed in the vicinity
of the quays. From the present knowledge it
cannot be concluded whether or not any of this
stems from the workshops within the port. /19/
quotes investigations that show that from all
waste oil sources in Nigeria, 97,5t was waste
lubricating oil, mainly used crank- case oil.
In the workshops within the port, waste oil is
collected in oil-drums. However, some oily
waste was observed in the open drainage chan-
nels though. There is a possibility of oil
entering the port waters from outside sources.
At the shipyard oil and grease is used for the
slipway. Some of this oil will enter the bay
water. There are plans for a new slipway sys-
tem. Some heavy metals may come from anti-
fouling ship-paintings, depending on whether
old or new types of paint are used.
- ships:
The oil close to the quays might also come
from the ships as leakage or oil-spills. How-
ever, this was not observed or reported. Sew-
age and solid waste from the ships are not
allowed to be emptied into the port waters.

some dust connected with the unloading of
clinkers. Ukloading of wheat only creates dust
very locally in the port area. Shipwrecks are
found in shallow water east of the port. where
they are clearly vsible protruding out of the
water close to the shore. The wrecks are main-
ly smaller fishing vessels, so future leakage
are supposed to consist of small amounts of
oily wastes.
Apart from the more or less continuous small
outlets of waste oil, it should be taken into
account that a large accidental oil spill
could have long-lasting detrimental effect on
the estuary and mangrove ecosystem. Mitigation
measures are considered in section 15.3.3.
- dredging:
in some ports and harbours hazardous sub-
stances from industries may have been accumu-
lated in the sediment of the sea-floor.  If
such ports are dredged, these substances may
enter  the  food webs. This  can  take place
either by re-suspension in the waters or by
the dumping of the dredged material in produc-
tive areas of the sea bottom. For Freetown
Port this is not likely to have taken place.
;                                              There is very little possibility of chemicals
to have accumulated in the sediment, because
of the absence of any significant chemically
polluting  industries.  Small  quantities  of
2           '.                                              metals may have come from the anti-fouling
ship-painting at the shipyard.
r
-  sources outside the port:
f ust as the port may pe-sible influence its
a ,    .,                                             surroundings, the port itself may in turn be
influenced from its surroundings. From the two
city dumps seepage are likely to take place in
the rainy season, especially from the unpro-
tected dump site at mouth of Kissy Brook. From
the fishing industry in Cline Bay there may be
organic loaded process water. For the time
being this industry is closed down.
The bay water along the coast of Freetown is
also affected by organic pollution from the
municipality; the rivers and streams that
enter the bays along the coast are loaded with
sewage, and also garbage and solid waste is
emptied into the bays. Also there may be a
risk of oil spills at the power plant, the oil
refinery and from the storage tanks. For the
time being the refinery is out of function and
no oil pollution was observed at the time of
the Consultants inspection.
A problem that most parts of Freetown is ex-
periencing during the rainy season is a heavy
siltation of the street drains. This is caused

by erosion of the hill sides, as most of the
vegetation has been cut down.
15.2.2 Potential Saurhes
and Xmpact          Sensitive areas:
In section 15.1 the coastal environment around
Freetown was described. Some types of areas are
generally considered specially vulnerable to pol-
lution. A list of such areas are given at the end
of section 15.3.2.2. Some environmental elements
play an essential role in the Freetown estuary
ecosystem. Significant elements are:
- mangrove; they are among the most productive
of all nature systems and their importance was
pointed out in section 15.1.4. Here it should
be noted that if an oil slip accident happens,
extensive areas of mangrove might be affected,
as this stretch through the intertidal zone.
Oily products will accumulate in the sediment.
and for several years toxic substances will
seep out with harmful effects on the produc-
tion of the system,
- the sea bottom of the central estuary is an
important area for many exploited fish species
that find their food at the bottom. This area
is dependant on the water quality, which will
affect the organisms living in or on the bot-
tom,
- Freetown. The main concern in the close vicin-
ity of the city is that of human health. This
to a large part is connected to the sanitary
situation,
- the sandy beaches along the Atlantic coast of
the Peninsula have importance as recreational
areas. They might be adversely affected by
drifting waste oil and garbage.
As described in the previous section, the poten-
tial sources of pollution in the port area are:
- industry,
- built-up areas including workshops and ship-
yards,
- ships and the lading/unloading of these,
- dredging and dumping of material from the
port.
To this list should be added sources outside the
port.
Present data do not allow a quantification of the
developments of pollution within these cat-
egories, but some expected tendencies can be
given.

-  industry:
The industries in the port area might develop
further. Whether this will be the case is of
cause partly dependent on economic evalu-
ations. but also dependent on possible physi-
cal space within the port area. If further
development taken place, increased amounts of
sewage and solid waste should be considered.
The systems for dealing with the increased
amounts of dust should be developed by the
industries. Presently, there are no plans for
new types of industries within the port area.
- built-up areas:
With an expected increase in the activities of
the port, increased number of staff and
workers can be expected, depending among other
things on the increase in efficiency of cargo
handling that will take place. More people
means more sewage and solid waste, and this
should be considered in the planning of the
sanitary and garbage-collecting systems. Also,
an increased volume of waste-oil can be ex-
pected.
- ships:
3                                              According to the forecasts in this report. the
i    _                                                developmtnt in the types and numbers of ships
calling at the port vary in the different
scenarios. The different combinations of types
and numbers of ships indicates in general that
the amount of sewage, solid waste and waste-
.~.             *                                 oil can be expected to rise only little.
t                                                     Even small increases in ship traffic gives
rise to increased risk of small or large-scale
spills of oil and hazardous substances.
- dredging:
It is evaluated in the previous section that
the risk of hazardous substances accumulating
in the sediment of the port is small. Con-
sequently there is little chance of such sub-
stances being spread in the environment, if
dredging is to be conducted.
-  sources outside the port:
A considerable part of sewage from the munici-
-     b                                              pality is ending in near-shore waters- Also
some waste oil from the workshops enters the
coastal waters. As the population of Freetown
*                                              is growing and an increased traffic and use of
.                                               engines can be expected, the need for sewage,
solid  waste  and  waste-oil  collecting  and
treatment systems will be accentuated.
At the moment neither the refinery nor the
fish processing industry are in function, and

the power plant is under rehabilitation. These
and ocher industries will possibly come to
active status, and the demand for further de-
velopment in power supply will increase. This
will further stress the need for safe hundrling
of oily products.
Conclusion: it can be concluded on the state of
pollution in and around the Freetown Port, that
the activities in the port only occasionally lead
to pollution of the waters and the air of the
port and its vicinity. One main threat to the
environment is the risk of accidental oil-spills
caused for instance by damage on pipes or colli-
sion or grounding of ships.
This statement should be seen in relation to ob-
jectives for water quality standards that are
generally set for commercial ports, as outlined
in section IS.3.2.1.
For the estuary the main potential threat from
the port and the ship traffic is the risk that
accidental larger oil-spills might enter the man-
groves. This will have detrimental effects on the
production of live organisms in the estuary for
several years.
15 3    MITIGATION
KZABUINS            The present situation of the  environment  for
Freetown Port and its coastal surroundings has
been described above. In this section mitigation
measures to counteract future potential increase
in pollution are suggested.
15.3.1 Present Znviron-
mental Measures      The measures are a combination of practices ac-
cording to port regulations and physical facil-
ities to handle sewage and garbage.
Arriving ships are informed that the port is run-
ning garbage collecting trucks. Sewage is not
allowed to be discharged into the port area.
Neither is it allowed to pump out waste oil,
bilge or ballast water in the port waters.There
arm, however, no reception facilities for any of
these discharges.
within its area the solid waste collecting trucks
of the port empties the content of the garbage
bins on the city dump. As mentioned in section
IS.2.1, the septic tanks are emptied by the city
council.
There are no emergency gear to use in case of
accidental leakages or oil-spills. An oil-spill
contingency plan is in preparation and a draft
plan is being evaluated by the authorities. -

The import and export of hazardous substances or
dangerous cargo is only of limited magnitude:
exact figures are difficult to extract.
15.3.2  Legislation and
Regulations         Sierra Leone is in an ongoing process of estab-
lishing legislations and regulations concerning
rhe protection of its environment.
Many countries have now established administra-
tive systems for the protection and conservation
of the environment against pollution. As water
quality is an essential environmental factor in
connection with port and coastal pollution, an
outline of such a system will be given here:
One of the main objectives of these systems is to
reduce the pollution of the waters by controlling
of emissions.
The main steps of the system are:
- establishment of objectives for water quality
15.3.2.1;
4                                              - establishment of emission standards, section
15  15.3.2.2;
- control   of  the  water  quality,   section
15.3.2.3.
The establishment of water quality standards and
emission standards are generally based on the
*                                            following criteria:
- restrictions on effluent are based on environ-
mental impact assessments:
- hazardous substances are evaluated separately,
and their outflow are restricted as far as
technically and economically possible.
The principles behind the general lines of en-
vironmental policy are common to a number of
countries. To relate the present situation for
Sierra Leonian ports and harbours  to interna-
tional measures, a review of relevant regulations
eli                                           and international conventions are given.
*5                                            In  relation  to  ports  and  harbours  attention
should be paid to pollution stemming from: har-
bour  activities  in  general  like  handling  of
I'                                           goods, liberation of substances from ships paint,
oil-spills from vessels, dredging activity and
l;                                           re-suspension   of   sediment   by   deep-draught
vessels.  Furthermore,  from fisheries ports and
harbours pollution might come from rinsing of
fish on the fishing vessels or in the fish mar-
kets as well as sewage outlets from fishing in-
dustries.

15.3.2.1 Objectives for
water Quality
Standards          In the planning of the use of the coastal areas,
the different waters should be classified ac-
cording to one of the following categories of
objectives for the en-ironment:
- objectives with rigid control and specific re-
quirements;
- general objective;
- objectives with modified requirements.
The general objective for a coastal area is that
pollution should be avoided. Discharge of pol-
luting substances must not cause changes in the
natural environment in these areas, nor must they
cause any impact on the open sea areas.
For certain areas, such as sewage discharge near-
fields and comsercial ports and harbours. the
general objective cannot be fulfilled. These
areas must be identified and delimited, and
modified requirements can be set and applied to
them.
Examples of water body classification and water
quality standards have been given below (for Tai-
wan, U.S.A. and Hong Kong).

*        .                                           MARPOL 73/78, The International Convention for
the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The ob-
jective of MARPOL is to prevent polluting dis-

*        s                                           at sea and in ports  and harbours.
Decisions are taken by the Marine Environment
Protection Committee  (MEPC), which meets once
every nine months. The secretariat of MARPOL is
in London, in the headquarters of IMO  (Inter-
national Maritime Organisation, UN' s agency for
technical, maritime questions).
D  LCWDONLondon Dumping Convention, LDC. The con-
vention regulates the dumping of waste and pol-
luting substances from ships and aeroplanes, as
well as combustion of waste at sea. It covers the
World oceans and the territorial seas of the
coastal states.
Decisions are taken at consultative meetings once
a year. The secretariat is in London together
with the MARPOL in the headquarters of the IMO.
The meetings are prepared by LDC's Scientific
Group on Dumping, in which experts from several
countries participate.

PARIS, Convention for the Prevention of Marine
Pollution from Land-Based Sources. The convention
covers the northeast Atlantic and the North Sea.
The objectives of the convention are to prevent
pollution from almost all types of substances and
from all land-based sources. As a general working
principle, the total flow of a substance is fol-
lowed - the so-called waste stream approach.
Decisions are taken by the Paris Commission (PAR-
COM), which has a secretariat in London. The com-
mission has two permanent groups, the Technical
Working Group (TwG), and the Joint Monitoring
Group (JMG), as well as several affiliated ad hoc
groups. The commission meets once every year.
In the process of preventing pollution, the con-
vention emphasises the use of non-waste technol-
ogy, if available, and the use of the best avail-
able techniques. By 'best available techniques,
is meant the latest stage of development (state
of the art) of processes, of facilities or of
methods of operation. For a particular process
these techniques will change with time in the
light of technological advances, economic and
social factors, as well as changes in scientific
knowledge and understanding. If the reduction of
discharges and emissions resulting from the use
of the best available techniques does not lead to
environmentally acceptable results, additional
measures have to be applied.
Few general standards are given in the appendices
of the convention. Each situation should be
evaluated separately, and criteria are given to
assess the nature and extent of the programmes
and measures and their time scales. Substances
which shall be subject to programmes and measures
include:
- heavy metals and their compounds;
- organohalogen compounds (and substances which
may form such compounds in the marine environ-
ment);
- organic compounds of phosphorus and silicon;
- biocides such as pesticides, fungicides, her-
bicides, insecticides, slimicides and chemi-
cals used, inter alia, for the preservation of
wood, timber, wood pulp, cellulose, paper,
hides and textiles;
- oils and hydrocarbons of petroleum origin;
- nitrogen and phosphorus compounds;
- radioactive substances, including waste;
- persistent synthetic materials which may
float, remain in suspension or sink.

AmiZrAN, Convention for Co-operation in the Pro-
tection and Development of the Marine and Coastal
Environment of the West and- Central African Re-
gion. The general obligations of the convention
are to prevent, reduce, combat and control pollu-
tion of the convention area and to ensure sound
environmental management of natural resources.
Th'% convention covers sources of pollution in-
cluded in the above mentioned MARPOL. LONDON and
PARIS conventions as well as pollution from ac-
tivities relating to exploration and exploitation
P                                                      of the sea-bed and pollution from or through the
atmosphere. Also coastal erosion is covered. The
contracting parties meet once every two years,
and the UNEP is designated as the secretariat of
the convention.
The convention holds a separate article on pro-
tection and preservation of rare or fragile eco-
systems. For the Sierra Leonean coastline, this
is specially relevant for the lagoons.
4t     --                                              on the national level several countries have set
up emission and discharge standards. These stan-
dards are set up in relation to the different
types of pollutants, which for ports and harbours
generally falls into the following groups in ac-
cordance with the source groups that are dis-
I                                            cussed in section 15.2:
r  >  ]                                      - waste water discharge, domestic or industrial;
- pollution caused by activities in the harbour;

- disposal of solid waste;
*                                            - leakage from solid waste dump sites.
Additionally, for fisheries ports and harbours
especially, pollution are likely to stem from the
rinsing of fish and from sewage outlets from
fishing industry. Mu Table 15.3.3 effluent stan-
dards for discharge of waste water into ports and
harbours and seas are given from Singapore.

polluting substances in the waters should be
carried out.

The estimation of the load contribution is mainly
based on measurements of material transport by
the current. An important element in this estima-

made' load. Also the seasonal fluctuation of the
load in of interest.
To evaluate the impact ot the load, the dilution
and the decay and turn-over time of the sub-
stances should be considered. If nontoxic organic
mater, for instance, is discharged in amounts
that are small compared to the 'natural' primary
production, there is no strong need for removal
of the discharged matter unless the discharges
are close to specially sensitive areas.
Accumulation of the substances might occur inside
the ports and harbours. Once the discharged sub-
stances are transported to the outside waters,
their concentration should be evaluated in rela-
tion to the natural net transport of the consi-
dered substances. If the discharge is compara-
tively small, it is hardly necessary to demand a
further removal.
In any evaluation on the impacts of polluting
substances, nearby sensitive areas must be taken
into consideration. As outlined above such areas
fall under the objectives with rigid control and
specific requirements. Types of areas within
these objectives are:
- areas of scientifical or recreational in-
teresting marine flora and fauna;
- reproduction or nursery grounds for fish;
- important fishing grounds;
- fishing grounds for oysters and mussel;
- areas with aquaculture;
- bathing beaches;
- areas with natural oxygen depletion;
- areas acting as references for comparison pur-
poses.
For the Sierra Leonean coastal zone the mangroves
will typically fall into this category, as
pointed out in section 15.2.2.

Pollution controL regulations
I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I
Pollution  regulations  generally  include  the
establishment of control programmes, which need
the specification of:
-  sampling  stations  (their  number and  posi-
tions);
- variables (types of measurements to be con-
¶         .                                                  ductedl;
-  frequency (razmber of samples in a given per-
iod).
Pollution control programmes most often cover the
control of waste water from factories, industrial
facilities and municipal treatment plants. In
order to make comparisons to 'natural, background
levels, reference stations are placed in presum-
ably non-polluted areas.
The pollution control regulations can also in-
clude pretreatment standards for waste water dis-
charges.
Of special importance for ports and harbours are
regulations for the control of oil pollution.
Regulations include demands for receiving facil-
ities in the ports and harbours and penalties if
dischargers fail to report a discharge.

1533.3   Recesmended
Measures           The systems and procedures for collecting the
sewage, solid waste and waste-oil should be de-
veloped according to the increase in activities
in the port with respect to the industries, the
built-up areas and the ships. For the ships, the
measures outlined in connection with the MARPOL
corvention should be implemented stepwise in ac-
cordance with the economic possibilities. This is
recommended whether or not this convention is
ratified by Sierra Leone. The agreements made in
several ports and harbours (among others Copen-
hagen) between the harbour and a refinery on the
waste oil fractions could be considered for adop-
tion.
Oily waste can be divided in the following main
groups:
- used lubricating oil,
- fuel residues,
- sludge,
- oily bilge water,
- dirty ballast water,
- oily tank washing.
A problem in the treatment of waste oils is that
they are often contaminated with cleaning agents,
which emulsify the oil.
Taking into consideration that the oil refinery
in Freetown is presently out of operation, an-
other possible solution will be suggested here:
Considerinra
- the present and the expected trend in volumes
of waste oil from the ships (section 15.2.21
indicating that the immediate and near-future
needs of reception facilities are fairly small
compared to ports, which are more heavily im-
pacted from industry and intense ship traffic,
- the existing and growing motorization and use
of other engines in Freetown,
- that the Port of Freetown is surrounded by a
very sensitive environment, the mangrove, that
k s great importance in several respects for
the population around the estuary, see section
15.1.4,
it is recommended that an integrated plan for ehe
collection and treatment of waste-oil from the
port and the larger Freetown area should be con-
sidered in closer detail. The outlines of a sug-
gested plan is given in the following:

i 1            15-28                                                            FINAL REPORT
4-~-                                                    
Waste-oil from the sources all over Freetown and
the port, such as workshops, existing and coming
industries, the port workshops and the shipyard
and ships calling at the 7ort, is collected by
bowsers and taken to the existing storage tanks
that are situated near the entrance to the port.
These tanks are presently not in use, and they
might be rebuilt into a reception tank and a
separation tank respectively. The oily part from
the separator is then taken to the power plant to
run a small, maybe 2 XWatt, power unit.
An incentive to such an integrated plan is that
there may be several sources of economic revenue:
charges on the deliverers of the waste oil and
from the generation of energy. Closer investiga-
tion into the potential amounts of waste otl from
the different sources and the economy in the sug-
gested plan will have to be carried out.
The shipwrecks in the shallow waters east of the
harbour should be removed to reduce high trace
metal concentrations in the estuary.
It should be ensured that waste disposals from
* X   2                                     the port are eliminated from the estuary.
* .      Q                                            The dumping sites for dredged material should be
chosen in agreement with the Environmental Pro-
tection Council.
* -                                              A long term monitoring programme for the environ-
mental quality in  the port and its vicinity
should be initiated.
An emeraency plan for serious pollution accidents
should be given high priority. Serious pollution
4         ,                                            accidents could primarily be caused by accidental
spills from industries or ships in the harbour

* .                                          tingency Plan for Sierra Leone is in draft.
Spill response capability should be developed by
investing  in  some  locally-held  equipment  for
dealing with smaller spills, starting with low-
cost equipment made of local materials rather
than  waiting  for  expensive  gear.  For  larger
spills, practical details for co-operative as-

out in accordance with the Abidjan convention.
it is recommended, that an oil-spill sensitivity
map of the area around Freetown and the estuary
is worked out in accordance with the types of
sensitive areas described in section 15.2.2 and
the objectives for water quality standards given
in section 15.3.2.1.
The Port of Freetown is well off with respect to
environmental conditions compared to many other
larger ports and harbours. Especially, the port
-                                                     does not carry a large piled up 'load' of pollu-
tants that would be extremely expensive to clear.
