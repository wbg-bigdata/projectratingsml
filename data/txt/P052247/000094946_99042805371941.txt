A.            Project Development Objective
1.           Project development objectives and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The proposed project has been designed as a vehicle for furthering the Bank's policy dialogue with MOMF while trying out
ways to enhance value added and competitiveness of the fisheries sector. More specifically, the project aims to:
* strengthen MOMF capacity to manage and develop the fishing sector, mainly by improving sector planning and
information systems; and
* test on a pilot basis new approaches to improve fish product quality, upgrade landing infrastructures. and consolidate
dialogue with the industry at the local level.
Indicators of performance will be:
*  the preparation of a medium-term investment program reflecting Government priorities and ministerial strategy; and
* an increase in the ex-vessel price of some targeted fish species.
B.            Strategic Context
1.            Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 16219 - MOR   Date of latest CAS discussion: 01/30/1997
The proposed project will contribute to the following CAS objectives:
* to support private sector development by encouraging faster growth and increasing competitiveness in the fisheries
sector;
* to support public sector reform, through decentralization and encouragement of private sector initiatives; and
*   to strengthen social and rural development, through expansion of labor intensive "small-scale" and "coastal" fisheries
development, thereby reducing poverty and the rural-urban gap.
2.           Main sector issues and Government strategy
Background. The fisheries sector plays a key role in Morocco's economy. Morocco is Africa's second largest fish
producer and the world's leading producer and exporter of sardines. With a long coastline, the waters of the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Eastern Central Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea are among the richest in the
world, holding large stocks of schooling surface-swimming pelagic, or blue fish (European sardine, anchovy, mackerel and
tuna), and of demersal, or bottom-dwelling fish and cephalopods (various white fish, squid, octopus and cuttlefish). Annual
fish catches from Moroccan waters are estimated to have increased steadily reaching about I million tons in 1996. An
active private sector developed at the beginning of the century. In 1918, the private fishing fleet numbered 20 motor boats
and around a hundred smaller boats with an annual capacity of 350 tons of fish. In 1998, the fleet consists of some 3,068
vessels, of which 2,609 for inshore fishing, 459 for deep-sea fishing and 12,000 small boats for small-scale fisheries. In
addition, some 400 foreign vessels are operating in Moroccan watcrs under international fisheries agreements.
The fisheries sector is socially and economically important. The annual catch has increased by an estimated 15 percent
during the last five years. Current estimates suggest a sustainable average annual yield of about 1.5 million tons, of which
700,000 tons of sardines and 100,000 tons of cephalopods under prcsent environmental conditions. Fisheries contributes
roughly 19 percent of total exports (200,000 tons in 1997 for a total value of US$710 million), 60 percent of agricultural
exports, and employs about 75,000 full time and 20-30,000 part-time persons. The sector has also assumed political
importance, as evidenced by the latest Fisheries Agreement with the European Union (EU), signed in November 1995. This
aims to: (a) achieve a sustainable level of resource exploitation for white fish and cephalopods over a period of four years,
mainly by reducing fishing rights for EU registered vessels; (b) provide Morocco with about US$750 million in
compensation paymnents over a four year period; and (c) phase-out tariff based quotas for canned fish imports (sardines,
mackerel and anchovy) from Morocco into the EU by 1999. The Agreement is expected to have a major impact on
Morocco's external trade, sector investment funding and sustainability of fish resources.

Kingdom of Morocco                                                              Pilot Fisheries Development Project
Sector Issues. Despite the pro-active policy of MOMF, fisheries sector development faces four critical issues:
*  improving fish resources management to reduce pressure on several species: demersal fish and cephalopods are
overfished, while the situation for small pelagic is more complex due to stock mobility and related annual fluctuations in
the biomass. It is estimated that the northern and central stocks (Zones A and B) are heavily exploited, while the stocks
in the South (Zone C) are under-utilized;
*  delivering cost-effective fisheries services by strengthening public sector capacity in strategic planning, fishing port
design and management, and fish product quality management, and supporting the private sector in assuming sectoral
responsibilities for service delivery;
*  increasing sectoral competitiveness to effectively adjust to ongoing liberalization, including reduced trade tariffs on
imported fishmeal, fish oil and related substitutes and eased price controls on small pelagics; and
*  creating alternative sources of employment by exploring labor intensive development opportunities in coastal and small-
scale fisheries and improving the competitiveness of the labor intensive, export oriented canning industry.
Governnent Strateg . The long-terrn objective of the Government is to ensure sustainable use of fish resources by the
national fleet and to promote social and economic development of the sector by improving competitiveness and efficiency
along the marketing chains. Since its creation in 1982, MOMF has developed its sector strategy to address these issues
through four specific activities:
-  improving knowledge of fish stocks and pursuing sustainable resource management, while increasing the share of
Moroccan vessels fishing in its EEZ;
*  improving existing port infrastructure and expanding infrastructure available for small-scale fisheries while promoting
institutional reform by targeting and strengthening the public role in areas such as technology development, training and
policy analysis;
-  reducing direct public intervention (prices, tariffs) in coastal fisheries and the processing industry while promoting
private investment and restructuring; and
-  supporting private sector empowerment by establishing Maritime Chambers and launching joint activities such as the
fleet modernization programs and the insurance scheme Addamane Al-Bahri.
Regarding employment, MOFM, in light of the difficulties of reconciling the conflicting objectives of improving the
competitiveness of the traditional canning industry and protecting employment, recognizes the need to prepare a thorough
and comprehensive strategy for the development of the sector. Overall employment levels in the sector can be increased by
limiting the introduction of modem seiners to what is incrementally needed to fully supply the canning industry and actively
promoting small-scale fisheries expansion, including by reallocating fish resources from coastal and industrial exploitation
to small-scale fisheries.
A Sector Policy Note, dated February 26, 1999, was submitted to the Bank and discussed at negotiations. It describes a set
of objectives and measures which define the main directions of the Government's strategy for the development of the
fisheries sector.
3.     Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Within its limited means, the project would be a vehicle to maintain a policy dialogue on fish resource management issues
and liaise with the technical assistance program supported by FAO (UTFIMOR/ 1I 7/MOR) which is already working on
stock assessment and fisheries management. It would support MOMF efforts to prepare a sector development strategy and
investment programn, notably by strengthening planning capacity within the Ministry. The strategy comes at an opportune
time, since the new Government is preparing the Economic and Social Development Plan (1999-2003) and because
international fisheries agreements, notably with the EU, will terminate at the end of 1999. On service delivery and public
sector performance, the project would help the Ministry to refocus itself on policy analysis and design and sectoral
planning. Through studies, the project would also assist the National Fisheries Authority (ONP) and National Research
Institute for Fisheries (INRH) to restructure to achieve greater financial viability, and develop a comprehensive information
system to support MOMF decentralization.

The project would also try out, on a pilot basis in three fishing ports, new ways of increasing sector competitiveness and
efficiency, by developing landing point facilities (fixed and mobile) for small-scale fisheries, by improving the management
and operation of fishing ports, by strengthening local dialogue with the fishing industry, by upgrading marketing and
processing facilities for fisheries products, and by redefining public and private financing mechanisms for port services. A
successful pilot would provide the basis for extension to other fishing ports.
C.            Project Description Summary
1.           Project components (see Annex 2for a detailed description and Annex 3for a detailed cost breakdown):
The proposed project is a pilot which will be implemented over a period of three years. Though limited in size compared to
other donors' activities, it would assist the Government to prepare and implement its medium term strategy to enhance
sector value added and competitiveness. The project would therefore aim to address the most pressing sector issues through
two main components:
*   institutional development to strengthen the ability of MOMF to manage and develop the fishing sector; and
•   pilot operations to enhance value added and competitiveness in the fishing sector, through intervention in three pilot
sites at critical points in the production/marketing chain.
The project will be executed by MOMF. The pilot operations will be executed in conjunction with three pilot fish auction
halls which will be built by ONP with its own budgetary resources. The sites selected for the three auction halls are Nador
for year 1, Tan Tan for year 2, and provisionally Tangier for year 3. Following successful discussions concerning the
handing over to MOMF of four fish auction halls currently managed by the Port Management Authority (ODEP), MOMF
could choose another location for the third pilot fish auction hall, probably Agadir or Casablanca.

2.            Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
Within its limnited scope, the proposed project will be a vehicle for advancing policy dialogue with MOMF. Activities will
be confined to monitoring the measures presented in the Sectoral Policy Note, including trade protection for fish meal,
pricing issues, tariff and tax regimes applicable in fishing ports, and cost-sharing mechanisms in marketing infrastructure
operations.
The project will also support certain institutional reforms, notably through two studies concerning decentralization and
restructuring of the fisheries sector: (a) a study of administrative reorganization; and (b) a study of the financing of the
sector, including support for restructuring ONP and INRH to achieve greater financial and management autonomy.
3.           Benefits and target population:
The main benefits from the three pilot areas would be: (a) higher quality fish and improved productivity for the processing
industry resulting in higher value added, increased income for fishermen, and greater job security; (b) enhanced quality
control and port infrastructure management; (c) reorganization and development of a more competitive fish processing

Kingdom of Morocco                                                              Pilot Fisheries Development Project
sector, better oriented to export markets; and (d) a strengthened small-scale fisheries sub-sector focusing on high value,
fresh fish products, and enhancing rural income and employment opportunities. The project will not directly support any
increase in production.
The target population consists of about 24,000 fishermen (most of them involved in small-scale and coastal fisheries), 6,400
workers in the processing industry (most of them seasonal female workers), and 7,000 persons ashore, including merchants.
Although employment data are not reliable, it is estimated that the project will involve about 35 percent of the people
directly employed in the sector.
The project will be mainly targeted at the population dependent on the fishing industry in the three pilot areas. Tan Tan,
located on the Atlantic coast, is the biggest fishing port in Morocco in terms of landings with about one third of total catch
(34 percent in 1997), while it represents only 12 percent of total catch value for the same year. Tangiers, situated on the
Strait of Gibraltar, and Nador, a Mediterranean port with privileged access to the Spanish market, are export-oriented.
specializing in high quality landings and valuable migratory species such as swordfish.
4.           Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation Period: 3 years, 1999-2002
Project Implementation
MOMF's Inspectorate General (IG) will be responsible for overall project implementation. Implementation of individual
components will involve central departments within MOMF, mainly the Marine Fisheries and Aquaculture Department
(DPMA), Fish Industries Department (DIP), and Training Department (DFMPSP). At the port level, the National Fisheries
Authority (ONP) will be responsible for the construction of and equipment for the pilot fish auction halls from its own
budget.
Project Coordination - Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements
A Project Manager will be appointed by ministerial decision for the duration of the project. The Project Manager will be
responsible for coordinating, planning, supervising and monitoring project activities with assistance from a Planning and
Policy Unit (PPU). This unit will be established within the General Secretariat (GS) and staffed by a team of three
specialists, in economics, statistics and fisheries. The head of this unit will be the Project Coordinator who will establish
procedures for monitoring and evaluating project performance. The PPU will also be responsible for designing and
monitoring sectoral strategy and development programs.
TIhe Steering Committee, established in March 1997 to guide project preparation will provide overall supervision and
monitoring throughout execution. It is chaired by the MOMF's Secretary General, and comprises technical specialists from
the various departments. Officials from the Ministries of Economics and Finance, General Government Affairs, Public
Works, Agriculture, and Environment will be invited periodically to discuss gcneral project progress and ensure inter-
ministerial coordination.
Accounting, Financial Reporting and Auditing Arrangements
Progress reports, as well as Financial management reports (FMR), will be prepared by the PPU. Project accounts will be
maintained by the Finance and Accounting Division (DFC) of MOMF. MOMF follows the rules of public accounting,
relying on good procedures and competent staff. In addition, the installation of a computerized management information
system is being studied by MOMF. Given the modest size of the Loan and the limited number of financial operations, it
does not make sense to develop specific software applications for consolidating project accounts and preparing the financial
statements. The Project Implementation Plan describes current systems, accounting arrangements required for project
management. It also contains an outline for the FMR prepared on the basis of the information currently available form the
Human Resources and Administration Department (DRHAG). The monitoring system for physical and financial progress
reflecting the new requirements of LACI in terms of disbursements forecasts and control mechanisms will be put in place
according to an action plan approved by MOMF.
Each year independent auditors acceptable to the Bank will audit the project accounts maintained and prepared by the
Financial and Accounting Division (DFC) in MOMF. Audit reports, including statements of expenditure and special
accounts reconciliation, will be submitted annually to the Bank within six months of the end of Government's financial year.

D.            Project Rationale
1.            Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
The speed and scope of adjustment of this complex, traditional sector is well suited to a pilot approach. A full-fledged
investment project in the first instance has been rejected for the following reasons:
* Besides allocating its own funds, Morocco has received EU and bilateral funds for a major, ongoing, infrastructure
investment program in the fisheries sector. This will be completed in 1999 and the proposed project will help prepare for
a follow up program;
* Current sector policies that maintain non-market pricing of raw material and fishmeal import tariffs have a politically
influential lobby; adjustment will require some change in the political consensus, and therefore major adjustment up-
front has been rejected as politically unfeasible and a more gradual adjustment process is being proposed. The necessary
legislation for pricing and tariff reforms essential for long term effectiveness of the small pelagic sector will be processed
during the project implementation period;
* While the knowledge necessary for rapid strearnlining of fish quality control and port management is available,
competency issues and staff training need to be carefully prepared and implemented so as to avoid institutional
resistance; and
* The transition period offered by a pilot operation will be used to build trust and strengthen professional associations to
progressively increase their responsibilities and participation in sector development.

In addition to these projects, a share of the fisheries agreement funds with the EU (about 10%) is being allocated to
MOMF's investment budget, and some of these are then transferred to ONP and INRH. The EU funding represented
MAD148 mnillion in FY96-97, MAD143 million in FY97-98 and MAD149 million (estimate) in FY98-99, respectively
84%, 77% and 90% of MOMF's investment budget. The amount transferred to ONP represents on average MAD2S
million a year to ONP mainly for the fleet improvement program, MAD20 million a year to INRH for stock assessment
and MAD6 million a year to the training institutes. These figures are presented in the Project Implementation Plan. It is
also to be noted that the port infrastructure program is being carried out by the Ministry of Public Works. Given this
situation, the investment program which will be developed over the next two years will have to focus on sustainability
issues.

Kingdom of Morocco                                                                 Pilot Fisheries Development Project
3.            Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
World Bank experience in Marine Fisheries Projects indicates that:
* Development of labor intensive catching technologies can be highly effective in a situation such as that of Morocco, as
suggested by experience from Yemen, Maldives and Indonesia. Altemative strategies favoring the introduction of capital
intensive, but labor saving industrial fishing technology, which is currently being tested in Morocco, would have adverse
implications for rural employment and reduce local value added;
* Development of specific fisheries technologies requires targeted public research support (development costs are high and
may not be recoverable; outcomes are uncertain), especially for labor intensive small-scale and coastal fisheries.
Structured preparation and training and close cooperation with fishermen's groups are essential precursors for these
developments;
* Fishing ports have specific funding, design and operational management requirements, in order to meet the needs of
coastal fleets and to ensure that port users play an integral role;
* Effective fish quality control requires a well balanced synergy between public control mechanisms and private sector
operations in the area of HACCP.  Extensive experience in upgrading fish quality control shows the need for a
combination of sufficient central and local laboratory capacity, staff training, and close coordination with the private
sector. Quality management improvement is a long-tern process;
• In planning fishing port infrastructure, the entire fisheries system needs to be explicitly considered; and
• Decentralized control and direct participation of communities in design, financing and implementation of programs
improve cost-effectiveness and ownership. In addition, local participation can release resources and managerial talents.
The proposed project will take the above lessons into account in its design, organization and implementation, by testing
labor intensive technologies, supporting small-scale fisheries, improving quality management, and promoting
decentralization and local participation.
4.            Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Ministries of General Government Affairs and Fisheries have requested Bank support for their sector program after
intense dialogue based on economic and sector work over the last three years which resulted in a Draft Fisheries Sector
Strategy Note, which was circulated and discussed in December 1996. Because of its importance, the Fisheries sector has
been included in the portfolio discussions between the Bank and the Government of Morocco.
A delegation from MOMF and ONP visited the Bank in March 1997 to discuss the basis for a Bank financed operation and
a very active Steering Committee was established that took the leadership role in project preparation.
MOMF is committed to restructuring ONP so as to disengage from direct commercial and production activities and to
concentrate on improving services, supporting professional association development and participation in service delivery,
including fish auction hall management. MOMF's commitment to decentralization is also illustrated by the establishment of
four Marine Chambers in July 1997, active participation of the newly created Professional Federations in implementing fleet
modernization programs and the insurance scheme Addamane Al-Bahri.
With the fishing sector's export performance exceeding that of the agriculture sector, the Government is increasingly aware
that such performance depends on heavily exploited demersal stocks. At the same time, while production volume is
virtually static, export growth mostly relied on price increases of demersal species. The authorities realize that future
export growth can only continue at current levels if fish resources remain exploited in a sustainable way, Morocco
increasingly produces high quality and high priced fish products, and most importantly, the traditional fish canning and
fishmeal sectors, which absorb more than half of Morocco's fish products have become more competitive and export
oriented.
MOMF and ONP are financing 60 percent of the total project costs which shows their commitment to project objectives and
their willingness to benefit from Bank assistance in the sector.

Kingdom of Morocco                                                                 Pilot Fisheries Development Project
5.            Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank is the only donor working with MOMF on policy and institutional issues. A modest-size project is seen by
MOMF as the vehicle for continued dialogue with the Bank and as an instrument to involve other donor partners in a joint
program underpinning and coordinating the country strategy for fisheries development and institutional capacity building.
In addition, the Bank is involved in Morocco in a wide range of activities which, unlike other donors, allow constructive
inter-sectoral dialogue including social aspects.
Analytical and strategy work conducted by the Bank, mainly for the canning industry with support from the Danish and
French Trust-funds, concludes that the current sector policy framework, although acceptable in the short-run, has
opportunity costs in terns of fish resource allocations, value added, employment and export incomes. During preparation
of the Draft Strategy Note, Bank staff provided critical intemational experience to the new Ministry to assist in designing a
strategy for promoting sustainable use of fish resources, sector development and policy reforms. The Bank has contributed
to this strategic planning process, and MOMF has expressed an interest in having continued access to such analytical
support which is lacking in the current multilateral and bilateral aid it receives which focus on investments, mainly
infrastructure.
The Bank has developed close relationships with key bilateral donors and FAO to ensure that the proposed project creates
synergy with related technical assistance activities in Morocco.
E.            Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the Project File, see Annex 8)
1.            Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[XI Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$ 9.5 million; ERR=19.6%  [ ]Cost Effectiveness Analysis: [ ] Other
In economic terns, the benefits of the project are based essentially on higher quality of fisheries products. Economic
analysis indicates a 19.6 percent Economic Rate of Return (ERR). The project net present value, at 10 percent Opportunity
Cost of Capital (OCC), is US$ 9.5 million. The economic viability of the project is therefore satisfactory, especially since
all investment and recurrent costs have been taken into account in the analysis, even those of components such as support
for institutional reforms, the benefits of which have not been estimated. Analysis shows that if the cost of support for
institutional reforms is not included in the calculations, the ERR rises to 21.1%.
Switching values (at 10% OCC) indicate that the project could withstand a 77 percent increase in costs or 43 percent
reduction in benefits. These tests indicate that overall project viability is not very sensitive to declines in performance.
However, since it is a pilot project which, over a period of three years, will support the development of certain activities by
testing new approaches to increase the quality of fisheries products, special attention should be paid during implementation
to keeping costs under control and respecting the agreed timetable.
2.            Financial (see Annex 5):
NPV = US$ 6.6 million; FRR = 15.4%; [XI (list issues below, e.g.,, cost recovery, tariff policies, financial controls)
The financial rate of return for the project is 15.4% with all investment and operating costs having been taken into account,
even those related to the institutional development component, for which no benefit could be quantified. The net present
value at the presumed opportunity cost of capital of 10% is US$ 6.6 million.
Financial analysis has also been used to estimate the profitability of the two main commercial activities under the project:
the improved landing sites and the pilot fish auction halls, in order to evaluate their sustainability. For the pilot halls, the
analysis was carried out on the basis of the estimated increase in marketing resulting from the progressive reduction of
outside sales and greater auctioning capacity which makes it possible to absorb seasonal peaks, all together representing an
increase of about 15% in the quantities of fish going through the auction over a period of seven years. Two technical
options were also tested, the construction of refrigerated and non-refrigerated halls, which give respectively rates of return



Project Appraisal Document                                                                           Page 9
Kingdom of Morocco                                                              Pilot Fisheries Development Project
of 13.1% and 16.6%, and net present values of US$ 0.6 million and US$ 1.1 rnillion at an opportunity cost of capital of
10%. In order to refine these estimates and eventually extend the halls to other ports, the project will rigorously monitor
their receipts and costs of operation and maintenance.
The second analysis concerns the improved landing sites, the estimated profitability of which should also be checked by a
close monitoring of receipts and expenses during the three years of the project. This analysis is based on an average
quantity of 600 tons of quality white fish which would be brought annually to each of the sites by about 100 fishermen.
The internal rate of return is estimated at 11%, and the net present value at an opportunity cost of 10%, is estimated at
MAD 425,000. This rate of return hardly exceeds the opportunity cost of capital, but can nevertheless be considered
satisfactory in view of the social nature of the sites. Small-scale fishermen are in fact classified among the least favored
socio-economic groups, and any profitable action which could increase their incomes sustainably should be considered
favorably. The volume and prices of the landed fish have been conservatively estimated.
3.            Fiscal:
The project size is relatively modest with a total cost of MAD 118.5 million. In addition, it will be partially fimded by ONP
(MAD 64.6 million). The impact on the budget of MOMF will be MAD 53.9 million for the entire implementation period,
which represents annually about 11% of the investnent budget in 1998-99. Moreover, the recurrent costs of the project are
marginal for MOMF since they total annually about MAD 1.0 million during the first three years after the end of the project
and decline progressively thereafter to MAD 150,000, or less than 2.0% of the operating budget of MOMF.
4.            Technical:
Two key, related technological issues affect the project and future sector strategy: (a) the choice of future fisheries
development in the South, in particular whether to encourage the fish canning industry to move to where fish are currently
being caught and landed (with all related issues of transfer of labor, public infrastructure requirements etc.), or to move the
catch to existing canneries (either by land or sea, in which case a number of industrial fishing vessels would be needed, with
the risk of substantially reducing employment in the coastal fishing fleet); and (b) the choice of new more appropriate
vessels, both for the traditional coastal fleet and for the small-scale fleet, which would allow to improve the quality of
fisheries products and to exploit other fisheries. These technological issues have major economic, financial, social and
policy implications; market based solutions may have negative social implications.
5.           Institutional:
Although MOMF and ONP staff has demonstrated, during preparation, strong ownership and adequate managerial
capacity, institutional issues are critical to the success of this operation. Key institutional constraints include the need to:
(a) complete the transfer to ONP of the four auction halls currently managed by the ODEP which will improve ONP overall
profitability and enable the implementation of divestiture plan in favor of the private sector. A transfer program is being
negotiated between ONP and ODEP which could be implemented starting July 1, 1999; (b) define the respective roles of
public, mainly ONP, and private sectors in service delivery; (c) strengthen the capacity of MOMF in planning and analysis
of sector policies; and (d) clarify the division of responsibilities at the local level between DIP, ONP and private sector
organizations.
6.            Social:
The canning industry provides (part-time) employment to a large group of women. Any action to move the location and
capacity of the canning industry therefore has an immediate and major impact on female employment in the coastal zone
which will be assessed during project implementation and an action plan for promotion of women's activities prepared.
7.           Environmental (see Annex 9):
Environmental Category:     []A           [XI B          [I C
The project has been rated in the environmental screening category "B". it will comply with Morocco's and the Bank's
legal environmental requirements. No major environmental issues are foreseen, instead, the environmental impact of the
project is expected to be strongly positive, especially in the field of food safety and quality management since quality

assurance activities to meet EU standards for sea food exports will be financed under the project. In addition, the project
would strengthen INRH's existing managerial and programming capacities for stock assessment. However, the project will
monitor possible environmental drawbacks in the pilot sites and propose adequate mitigation measures including: (a) use of
ozone depleted substance (ODS) free refrigeration equipment complying with the Montreal Protocol in new designs for
coastal vessels using refrigeration technology; (b) connection of wastewater discharge from the rehabilitated auction halls to
urban waste water; and (c) inclusion, in the feasibility study, of a waste management plan which will address any increase
in solid waste at the fish auction halls and landing facilities, including the monitoring of water quality according to the
mitigation plan in Annex 9.
8.           Participatory approach:
Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
There was extensive consultation during preparation of the Fisheries Strategy Note through a two-day Roundtable Meeting
organized in December 1995 during a Bank Mission with the major stakeholders involved, including representatives from
the private sector (e.g., fishermen, boat-owners, fish traders, meal producers and cannery owners) as well as from the public
entities (e.g., MOMF, MOF, MOA, MOPW, ONP and ODEP). The outcomes from such meetings have been taken into
account in the design and have helped MOMF and ONP to initiate a program with existing professional associations with
specific actions such as the fleet modernization program and the insurance scheme Addamane Al Bahri for fishermen and
boats.
The project will also specifically target: (a) small-scale fishermen around Tan Tan and Agadir with the construction of
Improved Landing Points and (b) seasonal female workers at fish processing factories in the three pilot areas through on-
the-job training and literacy programns
9.           Other key stakeholders:
Linked with these efforts are the creation of the Confd9ration Nationale de la Peche Co6tre (CNPC) and the Fediration
Nationale des Industries des Produits de la Peche (FENIP). Other activities, supported by the project, will promote
private sector participation in providing services at auction halls through the establishment of Joint Management
Committees. Moreover, the recent establishment of Marine Chambers in each of the four fishing zones aims at enhancing
private sector participation in sector policy and regulations at regional level. Aware of the need to increase private sector
ownership and responsibilities, ONP with FAO support has undertaken a study to develop an action plan to strengthen
professional organizations, and this is included in the project.

F.            Sustainability and Risks
1.            Sustainability:
From a purely fiscal perspective, recurrent costs count for less than 1% of total project costs and, therefore, do not
represent a heavy burden on MOMF operating budget. Project sustainability will mainly depend on: (a) administration and
beneficiaries ownership; (b) continued economic reforms; and (c) profitable new technologies.  The institutional
strengthening component explicitly promotes beneficiaries' involvement in decentralized development and supports reforms
for establishing financing mechanisms to ensure greater autonomy of ONP and INRH, and ensure the contributions of
professional associations in various service delivery and infrastructure management activities. The pilot scale of the project
aims at testing options and technologies to improve fish product quality at all critical point and enhance value added in the
production/marketing chain. Beside, the Government is highly commnitted to sustainable use of fish resources, and although
the project is not tackling these issues they are, nonetheless, addressed under an FAO project.

Annex 2
Project Area
1.   Three ports have been chosen as sites for pilot operations with upgraded fish auction halls: (a) Tan Tan, the
biggest fishing port on the Atlantic coast with major landings of small pelagic species from fishery stocks in the southem
zone presently considered under-exploited; (b) Nador, a Mediterranean port where privileged access to the Spanish
market encourages landings of high quality, including sardine intended for fresh consumption (sardine de bouche); and
(c) Tangier, a port situated on the Strait of Gibraltar with easy access to export markets and a local fishery targeting
valuable migratory species such as swordfish. The main fisheries characteristics of the three ports are summarized in
the table below.

Total ashore including merchants   2,000             3,000           2,000
Tan Tan
2.   The port of Tan Tan is situated on the Atlantic coast some 350 km south of Agadir at the northern edge of the
sparsely populated Sahara region. The port started operation in 1982, but problems of vessel access and siltation have
necessitated major improvements to the infrastructure. The new jetty provides a 77% increase in total quay length: the
original 750m (150im at 8m, 250m at 6m, 350m at 4m) is joined by a further 580m at 6.5m depth which will shortly be
ready for use. The total sheltered water area has increased from 74ha to 92ha. Eight large fish pumps which discharge
small pelagics intended for fish meal will be moved from their present position on the quay adjoining the market hall to
the new quay. This will provide better access for vessels landing fish for auction.
3.   Major constraints to port development include: (a) shortage of labor making it impossible to expand high value-
added production from smaU pelagics without bringing in labor, so local processing capacity is mainly for fish meal;
(b) limited local market so that white fish and most small pelagics for human consumption must be taken elsewhere
(white fish to Agadir and Casablanca, small pelagics for processing at Agadir and Safi); (c) limited local water supply
forces the port and all its users to depend on an unreliable supply of fresh water piped from Goulimime (a distance of

MOROCCO: Pilot Fisheries Development Project                                                     Page 2 of 5
150 kIn), with none of the waste treated or recycled. Other constraints include: (d) extreme random variation in dailv
supplv typical of small pelagic fisheries but on a large scale at Tan Tan, frustrating efficient use of unloading, transport
and processing capacities, although the new quay will reduce port congestion especially during the peak fishing season;
(e) erratic ice supplv caused partly by inconstant fresh water supply but compounded by insufficient ice storage
capacity (only two days' production), will need improvement if local sardine vessels start to use ice; and
(f) monopsonistic situation with few buyers visiting Tan Tan at present, prices are relatively low, leading sellers of
white fish to by-pass the local auction by sending their catch directly to Agadir or Casablanca.
Nador
4.   The port of Nador has a unique advantage in its proximity to the Spanish enclave of Melilla, from which ferries
depart daily for Spanish ports such as Malaga and Almeria. Exporters thus have convenient access to the Spanish and
other European markets. The coastal fleet landing at Nador consists mainly of trawlers and sardine seiners, but there is
also an unusually large number of small-scale craft. Apart from the very exacting needs of the Spanish market in
matters of quality, grading and presentation, there is a local preference for fresh sardine (sardine de bouche).
5.   As a result, all fish landed at Nador is carefully handled both at sea and ashore. On board vessels it is stowed
with ice in wooden boxes. Some sardine vessel owners have followed the practice of trawlers and palangriers by
insulating their holds. Scrupulous care is taken when unloading vessels to avoid damaging fish. Boxes can be rented
from a pool maintained, repaired and cleaned by a local service company dedicated to the purpose. This feature at
Nador anticipates future planned requirements for new or upgraded auction halls, except that plastic boxes will be used.
All fish landed at Nador is sold by auction, with the entire white fish catch plus representative samples of small pelagics
passing through the hall.
6.   Constraints in Nador include: (a) impracticability of improving the present auction hall which would be readily
upgradeable to satisfy modem standards of efficiency, hygiene and fish quality assurance were it not for problems
caused by vehicular traffic which must pass close by; (b) exposure of the present fish unloading quav to seasonal
easterly winds strong enough to compromise the safety of vessels alongside; and (c) a ban by local vessel owners on fish
landed elsewhere (poisson de transit), which they perceive as inferior, from being sold in the auction hall, for fear that
prices would be destabilized.
Tangier
7.   Tangier's location on the Strait of Gibraltar gives its fishing fleet opportunities not found elsewhere in Morocco.
Nearby fishing grounds are rocky and therefore not suitable for trawling or seining, but large valuable migratory fish
species such as tunas and swordfish pass regularly through the strait. As a result, a large fleet of palangriers has
developed at Tangier, targeting its efforts particularly on swordfish, now the dominant species landed for export (about
10% of total value). As in the case of Nador, all fish landed at Tangier are boxed at sea with ice. Another advantage
for exporters is the proximity of the Spanish mainland, easily accessible by frequent ferries to Algesires.
8.   Constraints to development of fishing activities include: (a) congestion with the existing auction hall too close to
the quay in this very congested port, making vessel unloading extremely difficult; (b) insufficient capacitv of the existing
auction hall which is too small to handle all the required throughput - some boxes of fish must wait outside in the sun,
thereby losing quality before being admitted to the hall, and causing even more congestion at the quayside;
(c) inadequate facilities for preserving swordfish which because of its shape cannot easily be iced and is therefore
dependent for preservation on air conditioning - absent in the present hall; (d) inadequate vehicle access to the existing
auction hail; and (e) too many peoDle in the fish auction hall.
9.   In all of the three pilot ports, the project will: (a) help to enhance fish quality in a properly chilled environment
particularly important for swordfish, by providing unloading equipment, lift trucks, conveyors and facilities for small
merchants to prepare and pack fresh fish; (b) improve management, especially of the new auction hall, through
increased participation of al stakeholders in managing fish marketing operations and in providing services; (c) provide

potential buyers with better and rapidly updated market information, which can be expected to assist prices in all ports
to reach equilibrium, enabling poisson de transit to be sold at the Nador and Tangier auction without prejudice to
locally landed fish; (d) improve awareness and practice of good hygiene and environmental protection; (e) set up a
system for objective measurement of fish quality and freshness on unloading from vessels; and (f) increase assurance of
continued access to EU markets, in particular the Spanish market served by Tangier and Nador.
Project Description
Institutional Development - US$ 1.0 million
10.  The objective of this component is to strengthen the ability of MOMF to manage and develop the fisheries sector,
with three lines of intervention: (a) support for institutional change; (b) development of an integrated information
system; and (c) setting up sectoral planning.
11.  Support for institutional change. This component will help redefine the objectives of central and peripheral
bodies and support the administration in decentralizing and restructuring organizations under its supervision - INRH
and ONP- so as to put decision-makers in closer contact with real local conditions. The project will finance two basic
studies to define a general framework for overall regionalization policy:
*    Study of Administrative Reorganization. The objectives of this study are : (a) to define the main lines of
integrated regionalization policy taking account of all administrative and consultative bodies in the sector;
(b) revising allocations between central and regional administrative services, bearing in mind the need to make the
private sector aware of its responsibilities and to refocus activities in the public sector; and (c) drawing up
proposals for internal reorganization of MOMF.
*    Study of Sector Financing. The purposes of this study are to: (a) analyze the fiscal situation of the sector,
including the system of levies within the fish halls and the charges for services within the fishing ports;
(b) examine the financial profitability of each fish hall and audit ONP's accounts to determine its borrowing
capacity on financial markets; and (c) analyze the financing mechanisms of INRH in order to put in place a
system of planning which is responsive to the requirements of research and exploitation of fisheries resources,
ensure a continuity in the financing of research in the long-term, improve the efficiency of budget execution of
research programs and adapt the internal organization of INRH to its new mandate.
12. Information System Development. Project activities will help to speed up the decentralization process and to
improve and better integrate management information systems in MOMF, INRH and ONP. Activities financed by the
project include: acquisition of computer equipment for three regional delegations (Tan Tan, Nador and Tangier); and a
study on the needs for aids to decision-making and development of specific decision-making aids for MOMF.
13.  Support for Sectoral Planning. Major changes characteristic of the sector and socio-economic development
imperatives argue for setting up within MOMF a sectoral planning unit which will also have overall responsibility for
coordinating project execution, as well as for a support unit for the advancement of women. The project will finance the
following activities:
*    Setting up a Planning and Policy Unit. This unit will be set up within the SG at MOMF with functional links to
other ministerial departments. The head of the unit will be responsible for monitoring and coordinating the
project, assisted by a fisheries economist and an economist-statistician. The project will finance: (a) technical
assistance to set up systems for sectoral planning, monitoring and appraisal; and (b) basic computer equipment.
One of the main tasks of the PPU will be to analyze the issues of future fisheries development in the South and
new more appropriate vessels discussed above (Section E. para. 3)
*    Setting up a Unit for Women's Advancement. MOMF will recruit a head for the women's advancement unit, who
will concentrate during the first year on quantifying the economic role of women in the sector, and on setting up a
medium term action plan for their social and economic development. The project will finance equipment for
setting up this unit.

Pilot Operations to Support Development of the Sector - USS 11.9 million.
14.  The project will support pilot activities aimed at strengthening value added and competitiveness in the fishing
sector, through intervention in three pilot sites (Tantan, Nador and Tangier) at all critical points in the
production/marketing chain. The project will finance the following sub-components:
15.  Support Towards Upgrading the Fleet. Through its "Program of Modernization of Coastal Fisheries," MOMF is
trying, through financial support using incentives, to encourage over the next five years: (a) the modernization of the
productive apparatus; (b) the improvement of handling and storage of the catch on board; (c) the introduction of new
fishing technologies; (d) the adoption of new technologies in boat construction; and (e) the optimization of working
conditions and security of the fishing community. This program, which began in 1996, is implemented by ONP which
has a modernization fund of MAD 200 million at its disposal for this purpose. Moreover, growing competitiveness on
foreign markets and the additional importance given to quality norms make it necessary to accelerate the process of
upgrading the coastal fisheries fleet and improving the conditions of handling and storage aboard the vessels. Within the
framework of the component, the project will contribute to the objectives of upgrading the coastal fleet in the following
areas:
e    Evaluation of the Modernization Program and Implementation of a Technico-Economic Monitoring System. he
project will finance a study to evaluate the ongoing program and make proposals as to the future direction of
coastal fleet upgrading. Based on the technico-economic validation of the options, the study would not be
undertaken until the second year of the program
*    Promotion of Small-Scale Fisheries. The project will support: (a) the DPMA in establishing a permanent and
unchangeable registration procedure for small-scale fisheries landings. This registration and identification
operation will also handle the monitoring and control aspects of the construction of artisinal units as well as
management systems for their seasonal movements. The latter could be coupled with the installation of radar
reflectors (metallic bands allowing for the detection by nights of such units) which would allow for a diminution
of the frequency of collisions and would increase the security of the fishing community who exercise a profession
in the field; and (d) the establishment, around the improved landing sites, of cooperative sources of supply to
provide small-scale fishermen with adequate fishing equipment, commonly used spare parts for motors, basic on-
board safety equipment small everyday supplies of foodstuffs and other items for shipboard life. This requires
ahead of time the formation of service cooperatives, the management of which should be entrusted to
professionals.
*    Quality Assurance On-Board Vessels. The project will put in place tools for managing quality at all levels of the
marketing chain and demonstrating their effectiveness. These tools concern all the actors in the chain, whether on
the boats, upon landing, during marketing, transport or processing. In this framework, a guide of good practices
aboard vessels will be prepared and distributed to the professionals concerned.
*    Strengthening of DPMA. The project will support DPMA in the following areas: (a) Upgrading of the fishing
fleet, by redeploying two staff in charge of technical monitoring of the ongoing program, in collaboration with
INRH and ONP. The project will finance their training in the area of naval construction, refrigeration and fishing
technology; (b) Diagnosis and support for the fight against marine pollution, by financing a study concerning the
diagnosis of measures and existing means for combating marine pollution. The project will also help DPMA to
develop the capacity and necessary means in order to take over this responsibility; (c) Support to security on-
board fishing vessels and in fishing communities, an aspect to which the MOMF attaches special importance.
The project will finance technical assistance for the preparation of guidelines concerning security on vessels and
improvement of the qualifications of the agents and inspectors in charge of making technical visits; and
(d) Issuance of procedural manuals which will complement the actions concerning security aboard vessels and the
fight against marine pollution.
16.  Improvements in landing fish. The project will contribute to supporting small-scale fisheries and employment
creation by building four permanent fishing centers, or Improved Landing Facilities. It is also planned to develop a
containerized (or mobile) landing site which would offer the possibility of "moving" infrastructure after several years if
important changes in the socio-economic environment and in the state of resources made it necessary. Each Improved

Landing Facility will comprise: (a) a chilled store; (b) an ice maker with store; (c) a fish store for small merchants; (d)
an office for the employees. Those centers should be located so as to link up with a pilot auction halls, particularly in the
south around Tantan and Agadir.
17.  Inmprovements in Marketing. Fish auction halls are the starting point for value in all variants of the marketing
chain and form the interface between producers and merchants. Quality management and involvement of users in the
halls are both vital to improve effectiveness of the marketing chain. This sub-component will finance activities in four
areas:
*    Pilot Auction Halls. On the basis of recommendations made in the ONP master plan of fishing ports, three pilot
sites have been identified, Tan Tan, Nador and Tangier (or Agadir or Casablanca) for initiating the program to
modernize auction halls in response to new constraints on quality. Feasibility studies have been completed for all
three sites. ONP will finance from its own resources construction and equipment of the new halls. The project
will finance the purchase of equipment for unloading and handling fish, such as fork lifts and conveyors, outside
the halls.
*    Pilot Hall Management. One project objective is to increase participation amongst users and professional
associations in managing public infrastructure and providing main services in the halls. To promote this
approach, a joint consultative management committee comprising local representatives from MOMF, ONP and
from the industry (vessel owners, fishermen, merchants and factory proprietors including canners and fish meal
producers), will be established at each of the three pilot sites. The duties of this committee, within which the
administration and professional associations will be equally represented in accordance with existing legislation
(comite paritaire), will be to organize commercial operations in the auction halls, define the role of CAPI,
manage the auction itself, and decide on investments in construction and equipment. More precisely the project
will assist in: (a) the redefinition of the statutes and mission of the Local Fishing Committees (LFC) and of the
CAPI; (b) the preparation of guidelines and of internal regulations for the pilot halls; (c) defining institutional
mechanisms to establish the CCGC and ensure equal representation; (d) a study of the operation and
maintenance costs and options for cost sharing; and (e) impact evaluation.
3    Operation to SRread Good Hygienic Practice. Staff recruited by ONP to popularize good practice will receive
suitable training to provide interactive encouragement to users of the three pilot halls in adopting a more
responsible attitude towards using and maintaining public infrastructure. This work will progress outward from
the halls to introduce good hygienic practice to fishing vessels, mobile salespeople and premises of merchants and
fish shops.
*    A Network of Quality and Freshness Measurement. This will be set up at vessel unloading points. The network
will depend on bringing local ONP staff up to standard (a logical extension of tasks undertaken by CAPI
personnel) under supervision of DIP. Introduction at all three sites will enable an assessment of progress in the
sector towards quality improvement.
18.  Improvements in Processing. To increase value added in processing factories the project will focus on:
(a) training to enable women working in factories to obtain qualifications; (b) producing a good practice guide specific
for hygiene in processing plants; and (c) developing a "Morocco Label" for final products.

The project will have significant direct and indirect benefits. A comprehensive economic analysis is presented in
Annex 7 of the Project Implementation Plan and summarized below.
Summary of Benefits and Costs
In economic terms, benefits will result mainly from improved quality management at each critical step of the
production/marketing chain (fiWzere). Hence, the project activities aim at improving the quality of fish products on the
boats, at the landing points, in the fish auction halls and during processing and marketing stages, allowing fisherrnen to
get a premium price. More specifically, pilot fish auction halls will improve marketing of landed fish, absorb the peaks
during the high season and attract informal sector merchants. Moreover, small-scale fishermen will have an opportunity
to access official markets in the improved landing points and increase market integration of high value products. It is
also expected that the project will contribute to improve quality and reliability in cannery raw material supply, while the
implementation of auto-control procedures in the processing industry will enhance value added and substantially reduce
the costs of laboratory analysis requested by the Veterinary Services. However, no estimate has been made of the long-
term, nationwide benefits to overall fisheries sector management, that would accrue from investments under the project
for institutional strengthening and enhanced quality management.
In the economic analysis, all investment, recurrent and production costs are computed on the basis of incremental
expenditures. More specifically, investment and operating costs include activities financed under the itstitutional
development and pilot marketing chain development components. Recurrent costs linked to sectoral planning activities
for the whole project life have been included because of their long-term outreach. Production costs relate to pilot fish
auction hall incremental operating costs compared to existing ones, operating costs of new landing points and
incremental costs for auto-control inside the canneries.
Main AssumDtions
*    Exchange rate: US$1.0=MAD9.23;
*    Present exchange rate is equivalent to economic cost of foreign exchange;
*    Project life: 30 years;
*    Investment period: 3 years;
*    Fish prices at auction halls, excluding marketing costs, are equivalent to economic prices; and
*    Taxes and price contingencies have been deducted from the financial costs presented in the COSTAB.

Sensitivity analysis I Switchine values of critical items:
Economic analysis indicates a 19.6 % Economic Rate of Return (ERR). The project Net Present Value, at
10 percent Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC), is MAD 88 million (about US$9.5 million equivalent), which is
economically acceptable since all investments and recurrent costs have been included in the analysis, while some
benefits, such as those derived from overall improvement in the fisheries sector management, have not been included
because they are not easily quantifiable.
Switching values (at 10% OCC) indicate that the project could withstand a 77 % increase in costs or a 43 %
reduction in benefits. These tests indicate that overall project viability is fairly robust and not very sensitive to declines
in performance. Detailed analysis indicates that to maintain a minimum 10% ERR, investment, recurrent and
productions costs would need to increase by 120 %/o, 3,756 % and 226 % respectively, or benefits to decline by 115 % in
pilot auction halls or 100 % in improved landing points for small-scale fishermen. Sensitivity tests based on 20%
increase in investment and production costs indicate that the ERR would decline to 17.1 % and 18.8 %, respectively,
while a 10% decrease in recurrent costs would not affect the ERR. Similarly, a 20% decline in benefits would result in
a decline of the ERR to 15.6 %. Finally, the ERR would still amount to 12.5 % with a simultaneous 20% cost increase
and 20% benefits decline.
Some pilot activities might be delayed or partially meet their objectives. These include the activities which air s1
the reduction in informal marketing of fish products in auction halls and the increase in quantities of fish trad d.Ii
improved landing points. Sensitivity tests show that lower objectives would not affect substantially project ec.tor -):
profitability. Thus, the ERR would be 19.3 % and 18.2 %, respectively, if the quantity of informal fish r6'
decreased by 25% and if only 500 tones instead of 600 are traded in improved landing points.
Financial Analysis
Detailed financial analyses have been undertaken for two of the project's pilot activities: improvemeint of
marketing facilities for Fish Auction Halls and Landing Facilities. These preliminary analysis show that the fozoncial.
viability of these two activities is satisfactory. However, given the pilot nature of these activities, a monitoring system
would be established during project implementation to assess financial costs and benefits and to verify the prfitailbty
of the proposed activities.
Improved Landing Facilities (PDA). Each improved landing facility is expected to be used by abow- 1,5C
fishermen. Based on annual catch estimates of 4-10 tons of demersal fish per boat, the total quantity of fish laud'-`.'
each PDA is conservatively estimated at 600 tons a year. The situation of fishermen, who currently have diffivuw- -
selling their fish due to lack of reliable intermediaries and low prices, should substantially improve, and there should
strong incentives for them to use the PDAs since ex-vessel prices are expected to increase as a result of greater
competition among fish buyers and improved quality of the products. The price premnium should allow the fishermen to
recover their additional marketing costs, currently estimated at MADl .5 per kg. The rate of return would be 11 %, and
the net present value (NPV), MAD425,000, at a 10% opportunity cost of capital. Given the positive social effects of
the improved landing facilities, this somewhat marginal rate of return is considered satisfactory. The modest investment
in PDAs under the project will thus benefit small-scale fishermen who do not have access to fish auction halls and who
are considered among the poorest in the country.
Pilot Fish Auction Halls. The financial profitability of constructing the pilot fish auction halls will be acceptable,
since preliminary analysis shows this activity to have a 13.1% FRR and a NPV of MAD 5.2 million. These results are
based on a conservative 15% increase in throughput, even though it is expected that the better marketing facilities will
attract more buyers and thus raise prices, leading in turn to higher volumes of fish transiting through the auction halls.
The FRR and NPV would be even higher if the auction halls were not air conditioned, assurming ONP's charges
remained the same as for the air conditioned facility. Further details of the expected costs and benefits of the pilot fish
auction halls facilities are given in the Project Implementation Plan.

Because of the pilot nature of the project, a detailed financial summary is difficult to establish. Nevertheless the
following points can be made:
*    Incremental recurrent expenditures resulting from the project activities after completion of implementation
would average MAD 30,000 per annum. This includes sectoral planning and information system activities.
*    The pilot fish auction halls are expected to collect 5% of the value of the fish passing through them to cover
their costs. Improved Landing Facilities (PDA) should also become financially viable after a start-up
period.

Annex 9
Environmental Impacts and Mitigation measures
Environmental legislation and regulatory framework
I.    The project complies with Morocco's and the Bank's legal environmental requirements. Pertinent to the project
are the wastewater and solid waste management regulations. Within the existing legislation for marine fisheries, Article
19 outlaws the "intentional destruction" of marine waters by releasing wastewater into the sea, and demands
authorization of the Minister of Fisheries for approval for any installation on the shore that would emit waste water into
the coastal waters. In practice, this law is difficult to enforce.
International conventions and adoption of environmental quality standards
2.    MoTocco has ratified the following relevant Conventions, 1976 Barcelona Convention on the Protection of the
Mediterranean Sea against Pollution and its related protocols (MALPOL), the 1972 London Dumping Convention and
Basel Convention. Despite discussions on the possible role that environmental management systems, such as ISO 14000
could play in improving both industrial competitiveness and environmental performance, Morocco has not taken steps
towards ISO 14000 certification, or any other management system standards such as the British BS7750 or EMAS, the
European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme.
Project Impacts
3.    No major environmental issues are foreseen, instead, the environmental impact of the project is expected to be
strongly positive. The anticipated impacts under the project are summarized in the attached Table.
4.    An analysis of the situation, regarding water availability and wastewater treatment at the three sites is briefly
presented below, together with mitigating measures to possible impacts from increased water use and the resulting
wastewater discharge.
(a) In Nador there is no wastewater treatment infrastructure serving the port. However, the system servicing Nador
town is reasonably close as to be linked to a future port/fish auction hall system. Wastewater networks in the
port are the responsibility of the Port Management Authority (ODEP), and the National Fisheries Authority
(ONP) will ensure that there is integration of water discharges from the fish auction hall/PDAs to the existing
wastewater treatment networks. The possibility of pre-treating and disinfecting wastewater before it enters the
central system will also be considered. Coordination with ODEP/local authorities/Ministry of Environrment will
be essential to ensure this.
(b) In Tangier, there is no wastewater treatment infrastructure. However, a study, to plan for water management
resources both in the local municipality and the port is currently under way. The study is being carried out with
the participation of the municipality, ODEP and the water company. The study is also designed to assess
additional demands (quantitatively and qualitatively) by the fish auction hall and PDA in terms of water supply
and wastewater treatment which will be integrated where possible.
(c) In Tan Tan, there is no wastewater treatment infrastructure and the process of a water strategy formulation,
which will include availability and waste management, will have to be initiated by ODEP and ONP together
with the local authorities and the Ministry of Environment. The result should be the preparation and
implementation of an Integrated Water Management plan, in cooperation with the municipality. If this should
not be feasible, a decentralized water management approach should be followed by ODEP in collaboration with
ONEP, on maximum pollution/emission levels developed in consultation with the Ministry of Environment

taking into account potential beneficial uses of the coastal waters. Adequate treatment levels and technology
would be identified and detailed costs calculated together with the implementation plan (discharge limits for the
fishery industry are proposed in the World Bank environmental guidelines of 1988. A new section on the Fish
and Shellfish Processing Industry, regarding the amount of water used at various stages of the processing cycle,
BOD, Total Nitrogen, total phosphorous and suspended solids, is currently under preparation for the World
Bank Pollution Prevention Abatement Handbook (Part III) and will be used.
5.    If new refrigeration equipment is purchased, as may be the case under the construction of landing points (PDAs)
for small-scale fisheries, it will be ODS free and will be required to comply with the Montreal Protocol, and/or use
alternative technology following publication of the World Bank's Pollution and Prevention and Abatement Handbook,
Part III, "Ozone Depleting Chemicals, presently under preparation.
6.    The degree of contamination from fish washing and cleaning, the main use of water in fish auction halls, as well
as from filleting (which only involves limited amounts of fish) is generally considered small2. Nevertheless, in order to
properly address any presence of solid waste at the pilot fish auction halls and the PDAs, a waste management plan will
have to be prepared making use of, to the extent possible, viable solutions to further process the fish waste. Where
fishmeal plants are present near the fish auction halls it should be possible to make this an economically viable
operation.
7.    To enhance the positive environmental impacts of the project, the minimum waste management principles that
will be included as part of the planning for the upgraded/new fish auction halls are presented below. Where possible,
notes indicating the status of the design for these principles in the proposed fish auction halls, have also been included.
(a) Minimization of water consumption through elimination of all solid waste and concentrated liquids from entering
the wastewater stream. For Tan Tan a semi-automated grid system to collect solid waste is planned, while for
the other fish auction hall the system may remain manual.
(b) Maximum dry pre-cleaning of equipment such as conveyor belts and containers, where possible, prior to
carefully programmed and controlled wet cleaning of production areas equipment and containers. In all three
fish auction halls, wood boxes which are more difficult to clean, are programmed for replacement with plastic
ones, which will be easier to clean.
(c) Equipment for outlets of wastewater channels should have screens and fat traps, to recover and reduce the
concentration of fats, suspended and settled solids and any other coarse material in the combined wastewater
stream.
(d) Provision of adequately cold, closed, and well-ventilated storage facilities for fish waste and daily transportation
to processing facilities. Refrigeration equipment for preserving fish quality is proposed for the fish auction hall
and some space could be dedicated to the storage of solid waste before transportation to processing facilities.
(e) Absolute cleanliness to minimize odor generation.
8.    Positive impacts on the environment and the management of the Moroccan fish resources are to be expected
from strengthening in sector planning, which will provide important inputs for the work being undertaken by the INRH
and the UTF project in fish stock evaluation and formulation of resource management policies and regulations.
9.    Although not directly linked to the environment, the project is expected to have a strong positive impact in the
area of food safety and quality management since a quality assurance management component that meets EU standards
for sea exports will be supported by the project. The compliance with EU standards will increase the threshold of food
safety and quality management in general. However, these standards do not mention environmental issues, such as waste
water and solid waste treatment.

Water Quality and Solid Waste Monitoring
10.   There are several studies in Morocco dealing with water quality issues, including the Second Environmental
Protection Project, specifically looking at the Sebou River basin, Sewage and Water Reuse II Project, Water Suprly V
Project and the Oil Pollution Management Project for the South-west Mediterranean Sea. Water quality is influence not
only by the discharge from the fishing halls, but also by the discharge from all the other port users, however the pi ect
will limit its monitoring only to the direct discharges from the fish auction halls. For each of the pilot fish auction 11,
MOMF will monitor the amount of the solid matter entering the sea. Filters will be purchased which, together with ..te
grill systems that will be installed in the auction halls, will largely reduced the solid waste entering the bay.
11    To ensure that the quality of water entering the system is of an acceptable standard, the amount of dissolved ions
entering the bay will be sampled, at the beginning of the project and thereafter twice or three times a year. INRH, will be
responsible for carrying out the measurements and sharing the results with the Bank. It will also be the responsibility of
INRH to ensure that the results are of the standards recommended in the draft Chapter of the Pollution Prevention and
Abatement Handbook prepared by the Bank. MOMF will also ensure that solid waste collected by both the grill and the
filter systems will be disposed of in such a way that it will not pollute the bay. Options for disposal will de discussed
with ONP to ensure that they meet the guidelines for pollution prevention as recommended by the Bank.
Fish Resources Monitoring and Evaluation
12.    The National Research Institute for Fisheries (Institut National de Recherche Halieutique INRH). Monitoring
and evaluation of fish stocks is carried out by INRH, which plays a key role in the efforts of the Government of
Morocco to assess and manage its fisheries resources. The Institute is responsible for the biological, oceanographic and
economic research underlying regular stock assessment and management recommendations to the MOMF. The Institute
has five regional centers and is currently expanding its operations with the assistance of the European Union.
Historically, the priority on data collection was targeted mainly at those resources exploited by the Moroccan fleet, and
those resources exploited by foreign boats were poorly monitored. There is more emphasis now on data collection
covering, equitably, all regions and boats. The Institute has recently become independent, and although public funding
will continue, levels may decline in the future. The Policy Note, discussed with the government stresses the importance
of resource monitoring and evaluation. Consequently, the government has assured supplemental resources for the
Institute to ensure adequate capacity to carry out its activities.
13.   International Cooperation. To date, the research programs of the Institute have benefited and continue to benefit
from the UNDP/FAO program and the regional FAO projects, mainly in the evaluation of stocks and the study of small-
scale fishing. The research has also benefited from bilateral cooperation with Russia and others, and through projects in
cooperation with Universities and other Moroccan research centers.
14.    Data Collection. Three main elements support the collection of data on fisheries in Morocco.
(a) Reporting System. Data conceming the level at which fish resources have been exploited has generally been
obtained through a reporting system, by Moroccan boats and certain foreign ones operating under the fishing
accord. Unfortunately, this system is problematic in that: (i) reporting of fish catches is weak and the poor port
control cannot address it; (ii) the system does not take into account fish catches off-loaded by small-scale
fishermen, who are often questioned through inquiries done on land; and (iii) the data is generally too aggregated
to permit in-depth studies which require a better separation by species, zones, and the time of capture.
Furthermore, data collection is not equitably distributed between zones and boats.
(b) Research Vessel. A research vessel dispatched annually by INRH assesses, directly, the cephalopods, coastal
shrimp, and dermesal stocks. The data, when analyzed, yields an annual index of abundance. Direct estimates

of abundance (and biomass) and pelagic stocks of the central and the southern zones are also estimated by a
regional FAO program with N/O Fritjof Nansen and a bilateral program of cooperation with N/O AtlantNIRO.
(c) GIS System. A GIS system, funded through the FAO project, has been installed, and a significant quantity of
historical data concerning cephalopods is being captured. It is expected that, in the near future, annual
evaluations of the state of stocks and preparation of an annual management plan of the stocks will take place -
before the fishing season, and eventually with the possibility of defining and developing methods which permit
the prediction of biomass in place and that which can be exploited each year.
15.   Although the project will not itself be undertaking any resource assessment and management, it will ensure that
the World Bank is kept informed on the status of resources and their management efforts by concerned parties. The
project progress reports to be prepared twice a year by the PPU will include a section on resource management and
monitoring and specific indicators for target species will be established.
16.   Institutional Strengthening. The project will support INRH restructuring effort by financing a study to
strengthen financial management and reasearch programming capacities. Uncertainty surrounding the future funding for
INRH has become critical and its research program strategy, management of operations, funding strategy and
institutional structure require adjustment to face the new funding environment. Specific TORs were prepared during pre-
appraisal.

Sectoral Policy Note
PROJET D'APPUI A LA VALORISATION
DES PRODUITS DE LA PECHE
NOTE DE POLMQUE SECTORIELLE
LES PECHES MARITIMES
Conscient des defis imposes par le nouveau type de societe, fond6 sur des realites
sociales, politiques, &conomiques et culturelles en perpetuelle mutation, le Royaume
du Maroc s'engage dans une dynamique de changement et de progres.
Le Gouvernement de SA MAJESTE LE ROI, considerant les efforts consentis et
l'ampleur de la tache qui reste a accomplir, a opte pour une strategie de croissance
economique forte, durable et generatrice d'emplois.
La politique des peches maritimes prend ses fondements dans ce nouveau
contexte national qui plaide pour la sauvegarde des ressources halieutiques,
l'exploitation durable et la valorisation des potentiels generes par le patrimoine
biologique marin national. Cette meme politique prendra en charge la mise a niveau
sociale des gens de mer.
Elle se place egalement dans un contexte international qui devient de plus en
plus sensible aux problemes d'amenagement des pecheries, et dans un marche
mondial liberalise, mais exigeant au niveau de la qualite.
Le Gouvernement, a la lurinre de ces realites, est en train de mettre en ceuvre
une strategie de developpement a moyen et a long terme qui privilegie la
preservation des ressources et entreprend la mise a. niveau globale du secteur.

I - LES CONTRAITES UT LES FADBLzsEse
Malgre ses atouts, le secteur des peches maritimes affronte un certain nombre de
contraintes et faiblesses, dont les principaux sont:
Au niveau de 1'6tat de la resource:
* La faiblesse des moyens accordes a la recherche et les lacunes dans le dispositif de suivi,
d'evaluation et de gestion des ressources halieutiques;
* La surexploitation des stocks halieutiques, tels ceux des cephalopodiers qui connaissent
un essoufflement certain dui a l'effort de peche excessif amplifie par la presence des
flottilles etrangeres ; et
* La diminution de la biomasse des ressources pelagiques en raison particulierement des
facteurs hydroclimatiques.
Au niveau de la composante sociale:
! Le faible niveau de qualification et d'encadrement des gens de mer et de la main d'oeuvre
employee dans les usines de transformation, qui se traduit par une perte sensible au
niveau de la productivite du travail et de la qualite du produit;
- Les conditions de travail difficiles et le manque de mesures de s6curit6 et dhygi6ne a bord
des bateaux et a terre, en raison notamment du deficit en infrastructure de base dans les
centres de peche ; et
- La faible couverture par des systemes d'assurance et de prevoyance sociale adaptes A la
specificite de l'emploi dans ce secteur.
Au niveau des filieres:
* La vetuste des outils de production notamment de la flotte c6tiere et artisanale;
- Le peu d'actions concernant la prospection et le developpement de filieres nouvelles;
- La faiblesse de coordination inter-professionnelle ; et
* L'opacite des marches de poisson, des systemes d'information commerciaux et de
formation des prix en raison de la multiplicite des intermediaires.
Au niveau du cadre incitatif et de la politique sectorieli.:
* Le manque d'incitation destinee a promouvoir les flottiUes c6tieres et artisanales et les
innovations techniques qui privilegient a la fois l'emploi, la valeur ajoutee et la protection
de l'environnement marin ; et
* Le manque de moyens destines a ameliorer la petite et moyenne infrastructure au niveau
littoral pour securiser et accroltre les revenus de la peche artisanale.
Au niveau institutionnel et r6glementaire:
* Des carences du systeme actuel de planification et de progranmmation des investissements
qui ne refl6tent que partiellement les objectifs prioritaires de la politique sectorielle;
* Du manque d'instrument performant pour analyser l'impact financier, dconomique social
et environnemental des differentes strategies envisag6es et des investissements ou projets
realises;

MOROCCO: Pilot Fisheries Development Project                                Page 3 of 8
* Des insuffisances dans les systemes de planification et de financement de la recherche ;et
* L'eclatement du systeme de concertation au niveau local, d'ou l'affaiblissement du r6le
initial du Comite local de peche.
Au niveau du systeme d'information:
* La defaillance au niveau du systeme de collecte des statistique en raison de l'importance
de l'informel et de l'eloignement de certains points d'activites de peche artisanale;
* Le manque de moyens humains et materiels au niveau des Delegations des Peches
Maritimes; et
* Le manque de complementarite et dharmonisation entre les composantes du systeme au
niveau du Ministere, de l'ONP et de lINRH.
II - LES OBJECTIFS STRATEGIQUES
Le plan de developpement du secteur des peches maritimes s'integre dans les nouvelles
orientations gouvemementales en matiere de developpement economique et social du Royaume.
La contribution du secteur a la realisation de ces objectifs se fera dans le cadre d'une
politique de preservation des ressources qui tient compte, de l'arrivee a echeance des accords de
peche, notamment celui avec l'Union Europeenne, et des opportunites qu'offre un marche
mondial des produits de la mer structurellement demandeur. Cette contribution passe par:
, Le developpement de la valorisation industrielle des produits de la mer a travers
F'amelioration des taux d'utilisation des unites industrielles existantes et la creation de
nouvelles unites de traitement des produits de la mer;
* L'augmentation de la consommation locale par diverses mesures qui ameliorent la qualite,
la disponibilite du poisson ainsi que l'efficacite des circuits de distribution sur l'ensemble
du territoire ; et
* La diversification des march6 a l'exportation par une politique dynamique de promotion du
Label Maroc, le developpement de nouveaux produits et le niveau de qualite.
III - LES PRIORITIES DE LA STRATEGIE DU MINISTERE DES PECHES MARITIMES
La vision strategique du secteur des peches maritimes repose sur la necessite de mettre en
avant la souverainete nationale sur les ressources marines disponibles dans la Zone Economique
Exclusive ainsi que sur la maximisation des retombees de l'exploitation du patrimoine
halieutique sur les conditions socio-economiques du citoyen marocain.
Dans le cadre de la preparation du plan quinquennal 1999-2003, la Ministere a elabore un
programme d'investissement global pour la promotion economique et sociale de l1ensemble de la
filiere peche.

MOROCCO: Pilot Fisheries Development Project                                     Page 4 of 8
Ce programme retient les axes de developpement suivants:
1. La preservation des ressources halieutiques;
2.  La promotion sociale;
3.  La mise a niveau des filieres ; et
4.  Le developpement du cadre incitatif et institutionnel.
1.  Pr6servation des ressources halieutigues
La nouvelle politique du Ministere des Peches Maritimes s'articule autour:
* D'une legislation actualisee des peches privilegiant la preservation des ressources et
renforcant les instruments juridiques et de contr6le de l'exploitation des stocks, y compris
la mise en place d'un systeme du contr6le des peches centres sur la surveillance par
satellite;
*  De l'laboration de plans d'amenagement des pecheries sur la base d'une meilleure
connaissance de l'etat des ressources halieutiques par pecherie et ou par espece ; et
* Du renforcement des moyens dintervention de llnstitut National de Recherche
Halieutique (INRH), notamment au niveau regional.
2.  La promotion sociale
Le point d'ancrage retenu pour la promotion sociale des gens de mer s'appuie sur la
construction de villages de pecheurs et de points de debarquement amenages le long de littoral.
Ces micro-p6les de developpement seront dotes d'infrastructures technique, conmmerciale,
administrative et sociale aL meme de stabiliser les communautes des pecheurs locaux.
Par ailleurs, le programme d'action du Ministere des Peches Maritimes en matiere sociale
repose sur le renforcement des activites d'alphabetisation, de vulgarisation et de formation
maritime, et une politique active de promotion sociale des gens de mer.
L'infrastructure de formation maritime sera renforcee par la construction d'6tablissements
de formation a Safi, a Laayoune, a Larache, a Dakhla, et la construction d'un bassin de
sauvetage a lISTPM d'Agadir et lITPM d'Al Hoceima et d'un centre de securite a Tan-Tan.
Le programme de couverture sociale ic Addamane El Bahri * sera renforce et adapte aux
exigences et conditions de l'emploi dans le secteur des peches maritimes, en se basant en
priorite sur l'assurance maladie.
3. DWvelovRement des filieres
Le developpement des filieres peches passe par la modernisation de la flotte c6tiere et
artisanale, l'extension des equipements portuaires, la construction et l'am6nagement de villages
de pecheurs et de points de debarquement, la promotion des industries de valorisation,
l'extension de l'infrastructure et des circuits de commercialisation, la promotion de nouveau
metiers et des services annexes a la peche.

MOROCCO: Pilot Fisheries Development Project                                    Page 5 of 8
*   Le programme de mise a niveau de la flotte de peche c6tiere, a pour objet de faire beneficier
le secteur, des progres techniques les plus adaptes au contexte national, en matiere de
manutention et de manipulation des captures dans une premiere etape et de la technologie
navale dans une seconde etape.
Ce programme sinteressera en outre a la generalisation de lutilisation de caisses
normalisees et a l'installations de cales isolees ou refrigerees a bord des navires c6tiers.
* L'effort public devra etre maintenue pour le fmancement des infrastructures et
equipements portuaires en vue d'achever les grands chantiers en cours comme le port de
Dakhla et de lancer de nouveaux projets notamment le port Boujdour. Des extensions
seront utiles dans d'autres ports comme a Essaouira, a Tarfaya et a Mehdia.
La construction de 5 villages de pecheurs et de 60 points de debarquement amenages est
prevue sur la periode 1999-2003.
*   La mise  a niveau des unites industrielles de valorisation des produits de la mer s'articulera
autour de:
- L'amelioration de la competitivite des entreprises;
- La promotion des investissements;
- La promotion des exportations ; et
- La promotion du marche local.
-   L'amelioration de l'infrastructure et des circuits de commercialisation beneficiera de:
-  La mise a niveau des halles en vue de leur certification;
- La construction de nouvelles halles normalisees a Nador, Tanger, Tan Tan, La&youne et
Dakhla;
- La construction de marche de gros et de d6tail, conformes aux normes de la qualite et de
la salubrite des produits de la peche.
*   Le Ministere visera la promotion de nouveaux metiers et l'encouragement des
investissements createurs d'emploi. Ces investissements concemeront particulierement, les
chantiers navals, les activites d'avitaillement des navires ainsi que l'industrie de materiel de
peche et les activites liees aux structures d'accueil destinees a la flottille de peche (cales
seches, systeme de halage, ateiers d'entretien specialises etc. ).
*   L'aquaculture et les autres activites littorales representent des opportunites importantes de
creation d'emplois dans le secteur. Le Ministere procedera a l'assainissement de
l'environnement institutionnel et reglementaire en vue d'encourager les investissements
dans ces activites.
4.  D6velopvement du cadre incitatif et institutionnel
Cadre incitatif
L'investissement public sera maintenu en fonction des besoins exprimes par le secteur. Le
Ministere poursuivra ses efforts de rationalisation des depenses en analysant les possibilites de
sous traiter certains services et en etablissant des contrats programmes avec les organismes
sous-tutelle.

MOROCCO: Pilot Fisheries Development Project                                    Page 6 of 8
Le Ministere des Peches Maritimes s'active pour creer un environnement favorable a
l'investissement dans la filiere des peches maritimes, plus particulierement dans le secteur de
transformation et de valorisation des produits de la mer.
Au niveau du mode de formation des prix, le Ministere entreprendra la reforme du systeme
en vue d'une meilleure repartition des captures vers des utilisations valorisantes, rendre plus
liberal le systeme de fixation du prix du poisson industriel a l'instar des prix des autres produits
frais. Dans ce cadre, le r6le du CAPI sera redefini vers un plus grand respect des forces du
marche et de 1'encouragement des professionnels a reguler leurs relations dans un cadre
contractuel concerte et un systeme d'information commercial plus transparent qui sera mis en
place au cours de trois prochaines annees.
Au niveau de la liberalisation du commerce exterieur, I'accord conclu avec l'UE, de libre
acces des conserves de sardine au marche europeen est en vigueur depuis le 01-01-1999.
Toutefois, les produits d'origine marocaine doivent etre en conformite avec les normes et
standards de qualite requis par l'UE. En outre, les autorites marocaines ont admis un
demantelement progressif de 9 taux de droit de douane, y compris ceux relatifs a la farine et
1huile de poisson, a raison de 2,5% par an.
Cadre institutionnel
En application des directives gouvernementales visant la deconcentration de
l'Administration Publique, le Ministere se dotera d'une nouvelle organisation, tant au niveau
central que regional.
Le Conseil Superieur pour la sauvegarde et l'exploitation du patrimoine halieutique sera
mis en place dans ses structures reglementaire et operationnelle.
Les Chambres des peches maritimes et de leur Federation b6neficieront du renforcement de
leur structure et de leurs moyens afin qu'elles puissent jouer pleinement leur r6le.
Les delegations de credits budgetaires seront ameliores pour atteindre un minimum de 20
% du budget de fonctionnement a partir de l'an 2000. Le taux d'encadrement des services
exterieurs sera porte a 45% en I'an 2000 contre 29% actuellement.
Les relations du Ministere des Peches Maritimes avec les etablissements publics sous sa
tutelle, notamment l'ONP et 1INRH, seront regies dans le cadre de contrat-programmes.
Le Ministere des Peches Maritimes renforcera egalement ses capacites de planification
sectorielle et de programmation des investissements. A cet effet, une cellule de planification sera
erigee au sein du Ministere.
