PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HONDURA,S
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
FIFTH & SIXTH POWER PROJECTS (LOANS 841-HO & 1081-HO)
PREFACE
The Fifth Power Project consisted of transmission facilities (at
230 kV) interconnecting the power systems of Honduras and Nicaragua, a
variety of transmission and sub-transmission facilities (at 138 kV and 34.5
kV, respectively), diesel sets at La Ceiba (4 x 6 MW), studies and training.
To support the Fifth Power Project, the Bank made Loan 841-HO (US$12.3
million) in June 1972 to Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE). This
was the fifth of eight Bank loans benefitting the power sector in Honduras.
Also supporting the Fifth Power Project was a loan (US$1.7 million) made in
1977 by the OPEC Fund for International Development.
The Sixth Power Project consisted of the extension of the Rio Llndo
hydroelectric plant, improvements of the rural transmission/distribution
system, distribution materials to repair damage caused by Hurricane Fifi
(1974), studies, and training. To help finance the Sixth Power Project, the
Bank made Loan 1081-HO (US$35.0 million) in January 1975 to ENEE. The
Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) also helped to finance
the project with three loans amounting to US$10.1 million (primarily to
finance the distribution component).
The Loan Agreement for Loan 841-HO became effective in December
1972; the final closing date was December 1981, more than five years after
the original closing date (June 1976). This delay was primarily due to the
introduction of various changes (additions and deletions) to the Project.
The Bank agreed to these changes, which led to the adoption of new completion
dates. ENEE expects to complete the last new component of the Project, a
load dispatch center, in 1985. The major original project components; the
diesel sets and the interconnection transmission line, were completed in 1973
and 1975, respectively.
The Loan Agreement for Loan 1081-1O became effective in April 1975;
the final closing date was December 1981, tlhree years after the original
closing date (December 1978). This delay, like the delay to the Fifth Power
Project, was due to the introduction of various changes to the Project -- the
addition of studies and a sub-transmission line.  The Bank agreed to these,
changes which led to the adoption of new completion dates. The original
Project items were completed in 1978, close to the original completion date.
The last of the new studies was completed in 1980; the sub-transmission line
was completed in 1982.



(ii,
The Latin American and Caribbean Region/Energy I prepared the
Project Completion Report (PCR) based on the Appraisal and President's
Reports, supervision and consultant's reports, other documents in the Bank's
files, a final project report prepared by ENEE, and conversations with ENEE
and Bank staff. The PCR sets forth main points with respect to the
preparation, appraisal, and implementation of the Fifth and Sixth Power
Projects, which were completed successfully, notwithstanding certain delays.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following normal procedures, OED sent a copy of the draft report to
the Government, ENEE, CABEI, and OPEC for comments. Those comments which were
received have been taken into account in finalizing the report and have been
appended.

1/ Not a fully meaningful comparison because of changes to the Project
(para.3.1.1). Actual and appraisal costs of components defined at
appraisal and subsequently completed were very close, about US$13.9
million . ENEE completed the last of the original project components (new
service extensions) in June, 1977, about 18 months late. This delay was
primarily due to construction rescheduling required because of higher priority
accorded repair of facilities damaged by Hurricane Fifi (September 1974).
Additions to the Project, especially construction of a load dispatch center,
extended completion to 1985.
2/ US$12,710.80 was cancelled from loan.
3/ Reflects completion of all components except central load dispatch facility
(not part of original project definition), which is expected in 1985.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HONDURAS
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (ENEE)
FIFTH & SIXTH POWER PROJECTS (LOANS 841-HO & 1081-HO)
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 841-HO (1972, US$12.3 million) helped to finance the Fifth
Power Project which consisted of a transmission line (at 230 1(i)
interconnecting the power systems of Honduras and Nicaragua, diesel sets (4 x
6 MW) at La Ceiba, transmission/distribution works, studies, and training.
The OPEC Fund for International Development supported the Project with a loan
of US$1.7 million in 1977.
With Bank agreement, ENEE deleted certain transmission/sub-
transmission works and added new components - studies and a load dispatch
center. The new components led to added costs and revised completion dates.
The final project cost was US$17.6 million as compared with the appraisal
forecast of US$16.0 million. Because of changes to the Project, the only
meaningful comparison is between the actual and forecast costs of items
defined at appraisal and actually completed. These were close -- about
US$13.9 million. The major original project items, the diesel sets and the
transmission lines, were completed in 1973 and 1975 respectively. ENEE
completed the last of the new studies in 1980; but does not expect to
complete the load dispatch center until 1985 (PCR, paras. 3.1.1-6; paras.
3.3.1-3.3.4).
ENEE carried out the Fifth Power Project successfully but the
benefits of the interconnection transmission line in the form of energy
transfers between Honduras and Nicaragua have been at a lower level than
anticipated at appraisal due to disappointing market growth in both countries
up to 1977, the civil war in Nicaragua (1978-1979), and the subsequent
strains between both Governments. Even if underutilized, according to ENEE,
the interconnection transmission line has provided benefits in the form of
access to generating capacity in emergencies and improved continuity of service
(PCR, paras. 3.2.5-6; Appendix I).
Having decided to postpone construction of the Cajon hydroelectric
project, ENEE identified the extension of the Rio Lindo hydro plant as its
next addition to its generating capacity (PCR, para. 2.3.1-2). With Loan
1081-HO (1975: US$35.0 million), the Bank helped to finance not only the
extension of the Rio Lindo plant but also improvements and extensions of the
rural transmission/distribution system, training and studies. The Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) also supported the Project
with three loans amounting to about US$10.1 millior..
With Bank agreement, ENEE added studies and a sub-transmission line
to the Project. These additions led to extra costs and revised completion
dates for the Project. The final cost of the Project was US$45.0 million as
compared with the appraisal forecast of US$41.3 million.  The final cost of
items defined at appraisal and subsequently completed was US$ 41.8 million,



(ix)
which was close to the appraisal forecast. The original Project
components were completed close to the original completion date of December
1978. The new studies were completed by 1980; the new sub-transmission line
was completed in 1982 (PCR, paras. 3.4.1-4). Because the Project helped to
meet forecast demand increases which were reasonably close to actual
increases, the achievements of the Project can be rated an overall success
(PCR, paras. 4.2.1).
Between 1972 and 1979, ENEE's financial performance was marginally
satisfactory. While ENEE did not always earn the covenanted rate of return
(10 Z), its summary contribution-to-expansion ratio (23.7%) was better than
that which was expected at appraisal (13.6%). This improvement was due
primarily to the postponement of investments expected at appraisal (primarily
the Cajon Project) (PCR, para. 5.2.1).
As expected at appraisal, the institutional performance of ENEE has
improved. ENEE has enjoyed the benefits of high-caliber top management; but
improvements in administrative efficiency have come slowly (PCR, para.
6.2.2).

EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA (EDEE)
FIFTH & S=TH POUER PROJECTS (LOANS 841-HO & 1081-HO)
1.1       Bank Lending to the Sector
1.1.1     Since 1959, the Bank has made seven loans and three credits
amounting to US$235.6 million equivalent to the power sector of Honduras
(Annex 1). The fifth and sixth loans, 841-HO and 1081-HO, helped to finance
the Fifth and Sixth Power Projects, which are the subjects of this report.
Four previous loans and two credits helped to finance the first four projects
which were completed successfully with some delays and cost overruns. The
seventh loan, 1629-HO (1978: US$30.5 million) helped to finance the Nispero
Project, which was completed with a delay of about 18 months in July 1982 and
a cost overrun of about 29.32. The eighth loan and the third credit, 1805-HO
and 989-HO (1980:US$105.0 million and US$20.0 million), are helping to finance
the Cajon project (292 Mg), which is the largest hydro electric project in
Central America.
1.2       Electric Power Sector Organization
1.2.1     ENEE is an autonomous public utility owned by the Republic of
Honduras. ENEE dominates the sector. No other entity takes part in new
service extensions, planning for the sector, or regulation of the sector.
ENEE's Board memsership is composed of representatives of various Ministries
(Finance, Public Works, National Resources, and Planning), the President of
the Central Bank, and a representative of the private sector. The Board sets
policy and appoints a General Manager, who is assisted by four Deputy
Managers and the Director of the Cajon Project Unit. After informal
discussions with the highest levels of political leadership, ENEE sets its
tariff levels. Because of budget and staff constraints, ENEE has delayed
implementing a series of recommendations to improve its organizational
structure.
1.3       Investment Plans
1.3.1     The Cajon project is expected to absorb the overwhelming bulk of
ENEE's financial resources through 1985. ENEE, which is experiencing some
stringency in generating adequate local-currency resources, expects to obtain
additional financinv from the Inter-American Development Bank. The
Government has difficult fiscal problems, which the Bank is addressing in
connection with a proposed structural adjustment loan.

II.   PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1       Origin and Preparaticn of the Fifth Power Project in Honduras
2.1.1     Preparation for the interconnection project began in July 1970 as
the result of a consultant's identification of the Cajon site as the most
promising for power development of three sites compared on the Humuya River
in Honduras. 1/ Bank staff made - preliminary estimate of capacity, output,
and cost at, respectively, 500 KW (later changed to about 300 NW), 1,300
GWh, and about US$85 million or US$170 per kW. These were very low cost
estimates for Central America (see Appendix I for coments of ENEE on early
studies of Cajon Project).
2.1.2     Despite the preliminary nature of the cost data -  a full
feasibility study was not expected until December 1972 - Bank staff began to
investigate the rationale for constructing the Cajon project in the near
term. Given the small size of the Honduran system (1970 sales: 228 GWh),
near-term construction of the Cajon project depended upon interconnection
with Nicaragua. 2/ To determine the benefits of interconnection and joint
operation, Bank itaff suggested that ENEE and its Nicaraguan counterpart,
Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (INE),3/ hire another consultant to
investigate the feasibility of interconnection and joint operation.
2.1.3     Using the preliminary cost estimates of the Cajon project, the
consultant confirmed the feasibility of an interconnection project in the
context of a joint development program which was least cost as compared with
the two separate programs. The joint program included:
Generation:
INE: 60 NW steam unit at Lake Managua (to be operational in 1975);
60 MW steam unit at Lake Managua (to be operational in 1977);
ENEE: 40 MW steam unit at La Ceiba (to be operational in 1974);
6 X 83 MW hydro electric plant at Cajon (to be operational in
1978) and;
Transmission:
INE and ENEE: 230 kV line (single-circuit) linking Lean in
Nicaragua to Tegucigalpa in Honduras (to be operational in 1975).
Initial voltage would be at 138 kV until commmissioning of the Cajon
hydro plant (expected in 1978).
1/ This pre-feasibility study was financed from Bank loans/credits
541/116-HO and 682/201-HO.
2/ Various obstacles (political, tariff, geographic or market) stood in the
way of interconnecting the Honduran system with the systems of El
Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.
3/ Formerly known as Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF).



-3-
The Honduran portion of the interconnection transmission line would cover a
distance of about 150 km. This line would replace a component of the Fourth
Power Project (loan/credit 682/201-HO), a 69 kv transmission line which ENEE
intended to construct between Tegucigalpa and the southern city of Choluteca
(a distance of about 90 km); and would extend an additional 60 km to the
border. The Nicaraguan portion of the interconnection line covered a
distance of about 100 km -- from Leon to the border.
2.1.4     After a series of preparatory missions to INE and ENEE in 1970 and
mid 1971, a pre-appraisal mission reviewed critically the economic
justification for the interconnection in August. As a result of this review,
the consultant amended his recommendation by modifying ENEE's generation
program through the substitution of two diesel sets (10 EW each) for the 40
MW steam plant.
2.1.5     In October 1971, appraisal missions simultaneously visited
Nicaragua and Honduras. On their return, in order to minimize capital
outlays of both companies, the missions further modified the generation
program as follows:
I-NE:    2x50 MW steam unit at Puerto Tiscuco in 1975 (to be
operational in 1975 and 1976);
ENEE:     4,r6 14 diesel unitq at La Ceiba (to be operational
by 1074): and
4x75 MW hydro units at the Cajon hydro plant (to be
operational in 1978).
It was expected that this combined expansion program (including the
interconnection line) would permit: (i) INE, through construction of the
steam plant, to meet its own load growth between 1974 and 1978 and that of
ENEE with lower-cost thermal energy than ENEE could supply itself; (ii) ENEE
to advance by several years the construction of the Cajon plant, with which
ENEE would supply low-cost hydro energy to INE; and (iii) both companies to
benefit from fuel savings resulting from the stand-by status of thermal
units. The appraisal reports for the Fifth Power Project in Honduras and the
Eighth Power Project in Nicaragua stated that, when compared to the
least-cost program for separate development of each system, the combined
INE-ENEE expansion program (including the interconnection transmission line,
the various thermal plants, and the large Cajon hydro electric project) would
be the least cost solution to the combined power development needs of the two
utility companies for discount rates up to 20X.
2.1.6     A key element in the justification for the joint development
program in general and the interconnection project in particular was the
market forecasts for Honduras and Nicaragua. For ENEE, the dynamic element
of its load forecast was the expected substitution of its energy (including
energy to be purchased from INE) for that generated by the foreign fruit
companies to supply their irrigation loads and the loads of the small cities
of La Lima, Tela and La Ceiba. Sales to the fruit companies and the
municipalities were expected to amount to about 23X of ENEE's entire load by
1977. During appraisal, representatives of the fruit companies confirmed
their interest in purchasing firm power from ENEE, subject to agreement on
tariff levels. ENEE planned to acquire the municipal systems.



-4-
2.1.7     Successful negotiations with the fruit company would be the basis
for an interconnection contract with INE. If the negotiations with the fruit
companies did not succeed or otherwise resulted in a substantial downward
revision of the sales forecast, ENEE would not need to purchase energy on a
firm basis from INE. Because of its importance to the interconnection
project, the Bank conditioned presentation of the proposed loan to the
signing of a satisfactory interconnection contract.
2.1.8    In addition to the load forecasts in Honduras and Nicaragua,
another key element in the justification of the joint development program was
the preliminary low-cost estimate of the Cajon project (US$88 million).
During appraisal, Bank staff assessed as acceptable the risks to the
interconnection project posed by a delay due to financing problems in the
construction of the Cajon project. The appraisal report stated that in the
event of a delay, the interconnection would still benefit ENEE and INE
because it would provide a means for the interchange of emergency power and
because the combined reserves of the two systems would be less than the
independent systpms. During appraisal, Bank staff did not assess the risks
to the interconnection project posed by an adverse development in
negotiations with the fruit companies.
2.1.9    In addition to the interconnection transmission line and the diesel
units at La Ceiba, the appraisal mission identified other elements of the
Project: a transmission line from La Ceiba to the Aguan Valley (47 km at 138
kV) and related substations plus about 90 km of sub-transmission (34.5 kV)
lines and substations in the Aguan Valley; sub-transmission lines and
substations to serve new areas (about 150 km at 34.5 kV); consulting services
to complete the Cajon feasibility study, to assess the Naranjito site on the
Rio Jicatuyo, and to carry out a preliminary hydro survey in eastern Honduras
(particularly the Rio Patuca); and training of ENEE staff.
2.1.10    The Fifth Power Project formed part of ENEE's expansion program for
the period 1972-1978. The other elements of the program included: (i)
completion of the first stage of the Rio Lindo Project (loan/credit
541/116-Ho) and the Fourth Power Project (loan/credit 682/201-HO); (ii)
improvement and expansion of the distribution system; (iii) acquisition of
existing systems owned by other companies and municipalities; and (iv) the
Cajon Project (paras. 2.1.2-.3).
2.2      Negotiations, Board Presentation, Loan Signing and Effectiveness
2.2.1    No major problems delayed negotiations. The samP was true with
respect to presentation of the proposed loan to the Executive Directors for
reasons set forth below.
2.2.2    As the date of board presentation aproached (June 27, 1972), ENEE
was conducting simultaneous negotiations with the fruit companies and INE.
The two power companies assured the Bank that they had resolved all major
problems, except for the amount of electricity which ENEE would purchase; and
that following successful completion of negotiations with the fruit
companies, they would sign an interconnection contract. Further, ENEE
expressed its confidence in the ultimate success of its negotiations with the
fruit companies; but declined to commit itself to the purchase of firm
amounts of energy from INE without corresponding commitments from the fruit
companies.



-5-
2.2.3     Believing that ENEE would ultimately negotiate satisfactory
contracts with the fruit companies, Bank management relaxed the earlier
condition of board presentation (the signing of a satisfactory
interconnection contract) but did condition disbursements pertaining to the
interconnection transmission line to the signing of a satisfactory
interconnection contract. Corresponding covenants were introduced into the
Loan Agreement for the Eighth Power Project in Nicaragua (SU0-NI).
Disbursements for the transmission line to the Aguan Valley were conditioned
to the presentation of a satisfactory economic justification. Following
approval by the Executive Directors, representatives of ENEE and the Bank
signed a loan agreement (June 28, 1972) providing US$12.3 million in support
of the Fifth Power Project (term: 24 years, including four years of grace;
interest rate: 7-1/4Z). Effectiveness of the loan agreement was delayed from
October 2, 1972 to December 1, 1972 because the Honduran Congress was slow to
ratify the loan documents.
2.3       Origin and Preparation of the Sixth Power Project in Honduras
2.3.1     By December 1972 -  six months after the signing of the Fifth Power
Loan Agreement (841-idO) - major expectations underlying the rationale for
the joint development program had changed radically and adversely. For
example, ENEE's consultant estimated the cost range for the Cajon project at
US$150-230 million, thereby making the project only marginally economic when
compared with the thermal alternative-a reasonable conclusion before the
advent of the worldwide fuel crisis--and leading Bank staff to ask new
questions about the economic justification of the project. Further, ENEE's
negotiations with the fruit companies for the supply of their irrigation
loads had nearly stalemated; and in Nicaragua, an earthquake leveled Managua,
INE's major load center, killing thousands and disrupting the economy.
2.3.2     Accordingly, in these circumstances, both compa.ies were anxious to
review their load forecasts; and neither was willing to sign an
interconnection contract calling for the purchase and sale of large blocks of
energy on a firm basis using an agreed tariff formula. Based on new
information about the economic justification of the Cajon project, ENEE
decided to postpone development until the 1980's. However, there was
still a need for additional generating capacity. By June 1973, ENEE had
identified the extension (2 X 20 NW) of the Rio Lindo plant 4' as the next
addition to its generating capacity. This project would use river water to
be diverted into Lake Yojoa and would be completed in 1978 - the original
completion date for the Cajon project. This project would also t'e the third
stage of development of the hydro-electric potential of Lake Yojoa. The Bank
helped to finance the first two stages (Annex 1). ENEE has attributed the
postponement of the Cajon project during 1973 and 1974 to the Bank's requests
for additional technical and geologic studies. Bank records do not support
the delaying role attributed by ENEE to these studies (Appendix I).
2.3.3     With Bank agreement, ENEE funded a feasibility study for the
extension of the Rio Lindo plant with proceeds from Loan 841-HO. While this
study was being carried out, representatives nf the Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) discussed the latter's proposal to
finance the proposed project with monies from its Fund for Special Operations
(FSO). Because the Bank's procurement rules were less restrictive than those
of the IDB and were therefore expected to generate some price competition
advantageous to ENEE, the IDB did not press its offer to finance the
project. ENEE informally informed the Bank of its preference for Bank
financing.

-6-
2.3.4     Upon compleaion of the feasibility study (February-March 1973), a
Bank mission appraised the project (April 1973). The Rio Lindo extension was
based on the construction of four small dams to divert three rivers into Lake
Yojoa, the construction of new pipeline and penstock, and the addition of new
generation capacity (2 x 20 MW). The cost estimates of the Rio Lindo
extension were based on the feasibility study, not on detailed engineering
studies, as now required by the Bank.
2.3.5     In addition to the expansion of the Rio Lindo plant, the mission
identified other elements of the Project: improvements and extension of the
transmission/distribution system serving new rural customers for the period
1975-1978; materials and equipment to repair equipment damaged by Hurricane
Fifi; training for top-level, supervisory, and technical personnel; and
studies of a future hydro project (either Remolino or a site to be identified
in the course of the hydro survey of eastern Honduras - para. 2.1.9), small
hydro sites, administrative improvements, and tariffs based on the marginal
cost of supply. The project would form part of ENEE's expansion program for
1974-1982, which was expected to consist of: completion of the Fourth and
Fifth Power Projects (para. 2.1.10), normal distribution expansion, and
-onstruction of the Cajon (300 MW) or Naranjito (70-100 MW) projects.
2.3.6     At about the time the Bank was appraising the Project, ENEE
successfully arranged two loans from the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration (CABEI) to finance the foreign cost of (i) the diversion dam on
the Rio Lindo and (ii) some engineering (plus some local-currency costs).
The two loans amounted to US$0.4 million and US$1.4 million, respectively.
ENEE also arranged for a third CABEI loan (US$8.3 million) to help to finance
its distribution expansion. The distribution expansion partially financed by
the third CABEI loan was included in the definition of the Sixth Power
Project. To ensure adequate local-cost financing for ENEE's expansion plan,
the Bank conditioned Board presentation to the implementation of: (i} a
revaluation of ENEE's rate base ; and (ii) a tariff increase and P fuel
adjustment clause sufficient to provide ENEE with a 107 rate of return
on revalued assets.
2.4       Negotiations, Board Presentation, Loan Signing, and Effectiveness
of the Sixth Power Loan Agreement
2.4.1     No major problems delayed negotiations (November 2974) or Board
presentation (January 1975). ENEE implemented measures which were a
condition of Board presentation -- increasing tariffs by 25Z, instituting a
fuel adjustment clause and revaluing assets. On January 28, 1975, Bank-and
ENEE representatives signed a loan agreement (1081-HO), providing for a loan
of US$35.0 million in support of the Sixth Power Project (term: 25 years,
including 4-1/2 years grace; interest rate: 8X). Effectiveness of the loan
agreement was delayed from April 30, 1975 to May 5, 1975, because of a
political crisis which convulsed the Government.
2.5       Major Covenants of the Fifth and Sixth Power Loan and Guarantee
Agreements
2.5.1     Annexes 2 and 3 set forth the major covenants of the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements for the Fifth and Sixth Power Projects. Except for slow
action in raising tariffs, the compliance of ENEE and the Government was
satisfactory.

III. PROJECT COST AND EXECUTION
3.1       Fifth Power Project: Changes, Costs, and Delays
3.1.1     Changes to the Fifth Power Project included: (i)  the deletion of
the Aguan Valley transmission line, which had an appraisal cost estimate of
US$2.1 million; and (ii) the addition of three new studies and a central
dispatch facility, which together had an actual cost of US$3.7 million. The
Bank agreed to these changes, which led to additional costs and new
completion dates, especially for the new project components.
3.1.2     The deletion of the Aguan Valley transmission line resulted from
the unsuccesful ending of negotiations with one of the foreign fruit
companies (para 2.3.1) to supply its irrigation load.  The properties of this
company suffered extensive hurricane damage (September 1974). Later, ENEE
constructed this line - again with Bank agreement -- using funding provided
by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to meet the load of a
number of new Government-sponsored projects (a saw mill. an agricultural.
resettlement scheme, etc.). The deletion of this Project component led to a
re-allocation of loan proceeds to help finance the cost of additional studies
and part of the cost of the dispatch center. With Bank assistance, ENEE
successfully arranged complementary financing with a loan from OPEC Fund for
International Development (US$1.7 million) in .377, and, later, a suppliers
credit (US$0.8 million). Bank and ENEE staff collaborated succesfully in
finding solutions to the problems posed by the changee to the Project.
3.1.3     Including all changes, the final cost of the Project was about
US$17.6 million (in current prices) as compared with the appraisal forecast
of US$16.0 million. However, because of changes to the Project, the only
meaningful comparison is between the actual and forecast costs of components
defined at appraisal and subsequently completed - that is, the diesel sets,
interconnection transmission line, new service extensions, studies, and
training. The actual and appraisal costs of these components were very
close, about US$13.9 million, indicating adequate prcvision for price and
contingency allowances. Given that the actual and forecast costs of these
components were close, this report does not include a calculation of the
actual cost of the project in constant prices as of October 1971, the date of
appraisal.  This calculation would show a modest cost underrun.
3.1.4     There was some delay in completing the new service extensions
because of the priority accorded the repair of facilities damaged by
Hurricane Fifi (September 1974). There was also some delay in completing the
interconnection transmission line (see below). Otherwise, ENEE succeeded in
completing on schedule the components of the original Project (except, of
course, the Aguan Valley transmission line, which was deleted - para 3.1.1).
3.1.5     Consultants completed the new studies during the period 1977-1980.
ENEE expects to complete the central dispatch center in 1985 - about nine
years after the original completion date of the Project: December 1975.



-8-
3.1.6     Eleven engineers received training abroad with financing from Loan
841-HO. Only US$50,000 was disbursed for training under this loan rather
than US$400,000 as expected. With additional support from other Bank Loans
(1081-HO and 1629-HO), ENEE financed the foreign-currency cost of part of its
training program. ENEE has devoted considerable attention to training its
staff. Between 1973 and 1980, about 100 technical and administrative staff
received training outside of Honduras.
3.1.'T    Annexes 4, 5, 6, and 7 compare actual and forecast data on,
respectively, project cost, completion dates, cumulative disbursements, and
allocation of loan proceeds for the Fifth Power Project.
3.2       Fifth Power Project:  Interconnection Transmission Line
3.2.1     ENEE completed construction of the interconnection transmission
line in December 1975, a year late. Late completion did not lead to
rationing or otherwise adversely affect the ability of ENEE to meet its load,
which in 1975 was 17.6% below the appraisal forecast for the Fifth Power
Project. The interconnection transmission line was comm'ssioned in September
1976, following the late completion by the Nicaraguan power company of its
complementary generation and transmission works.
3.2.2     The delay in completing the interconnection transmission line had
its origins in the disagreement between ENEE and INE over a tariff-setting
formula proposed by a consultant (see Appendix I for ENEE's comments on
delays to interconnection). Also complicating matters was the reluctance of
ENEE to sign an interconnection contract for the purchase and sale of firm
power without a corresponding commitment from the foreign fruit companies
(para 2.2.2-.3). After signing of the Loan Agreement, the negotiations with
the fruit companies over tariff levels progressed very slowly. Because of
the slow progress plus other problems (para 2.3.1), both companies abandoned
the concept of a contract for the sale of firm energy in favor of a
non-binding agreement for the exchange of emergency and short-term energy
(May 1973). As ENEE maintained an optimistic outlook with respect to the
final result of its negotiations with the fruit companies, the Bank accepted
a revised load forecast reflecting this optimism (Annex 8 ). The revised
load forecast was part of a new demonstration justifying the interconnection
as part of a lesser-cost joint development sequence (as compared with
independent development), not including near-term construction of the Cajon
project. Based on this new justification, the Bank accepted the non-binding
contract as fulfilling the conditions for disbursement (February 1974).
However, because of the time required to fulfill this condition -- about one
year more than expected -- there was a corresponding delay in contructing the
interconnection transmission line.
3.2.3     ENEE took over the municipal systems of La Ceiba, Tela, and La Lima
and negotiated successfully a contract to meet the irrigation load of one of
the fruit companies based on the eventual retirement of its uneconomic
diesels. Negotiations with the second fruit company did not result in a
contract because of the decision of the fruit company to reduce its
operations in the Aguan Valley following extensive property damage inflicted
by Hurricane Fifi (September 1974). The hurricane could not have been
foreseen during appraisal or later.



-9-
3.2.4     Having accepted the interconnection contract, Bank staff
anticipated a delay of up to five years in the start of the Cajon project
it turned out to be eight years - but felt that the agreement was a first
step which would generate confidence between the two companies and would lead
to a contract providing for the exchange of firm energy and power in the
future. Baak staff accepted the extra (political) risks associated with
constructing a transmission line between two sovereign countries. The market
risks associated with negotiating contracts with the fruit companies appeared
to be acceptable. In these circumstances, the decision to accept the
contract and to proceed with construction of the transmission line was
reasonable.
3.2.5     As measured by the actual amount of energy exchanged between the
two companies (Annex 9), the utilization of the interconnection transmission
line has been poor, far below expectations. During the period 1975-1977,
ENEE sold IKE about 28.9 GWh; and INE sold ENEE about 13 GWh (Annex 10). At
appraisal, INE expected to be a net exporter of energy (550 GWh) during this
period. During the next three years, ENEE sold INE 31.2 GWh; and INE sold
ENEE about 41.0 GWh. At appraisal, INE was expected to be a net importer of
energy (1,515 GWh). For the period 1975-1977, the sales pattern reflected
the delay in commissioning the interconnection transmission line (September
1976 as compared with December 1974) and market forces -- that is, the load
(primarily irrigation) in Honduras had not grown as expected by 1977. Later,
political factors adversely affected the utilization of the line: the civil
war in Nicaragua and the subsequent strains between the governments of
Nicaragua and Honduras.
3.2.6     The interconnection has led to close co-operation, if not close
integration, of the londuran and Nicaraguan systems (see Appendix I for
ENEE's comments on usefulness of interconnection). ENEE reported that
neither system maintains spinning reserves; and that since the end of the
civil war, the operation of the interconnection on the part of INE has been
rather erratic. By providing access to generating capacity in emergencies
and thereby improving the continuity of service, ENEE feels the
interconnection has been useful. Nevertheless, as measured by energy
exchanges, the interconnection remains an underutilized facility.
3.3       Fifth Power Project:  Studies and Central Dispatch Facility
3.3.1     The three studies originally defined at appraisal (Naranjito,
Cajon, and the eastern Honduras hydro survey) were completed on schedule but
with a cost increase of about US$1.1 million (or 65%). A feasibility study
showed that a hydro plant constructed at the Cajon site would be only
marginally economic when compared with a thermal alternative. Based on
additional economic studies of the Cajon project, ENEE decided to postpone
construction (para 2.3.1) (see Appendix I for ENEE's comments on delays to
Cajon project).  Later, in December 1975, ENEE contracted additional studies
of the Cajon project which helped provide justification for its subsequent
development.
3.3.2     The Naranjito study showed that a hydro plant constructed at that
location was technically feasible but not least cost as compared with a
thermal alternative.  The hydro survey of eastern Honduras identified three
basins large enough to provide water for projects with installed capacity
appropriate for londuras - the Patuca, the Seco, and the Aguan. In
connection with the Nispero Project (Loan 1629-HO), ENEE is committed to
carry out a feasibility study for a hydro plant located on the Patuca River.

3.3.3     The three new studies were:
(i)    a full feasibility study of the extension of the Rio Lindo
plant. This study provided justification for the Sixth
Power Project.  It wa- later found that the geological
investigations were limited, requiring substantial redesign
of civil works.
(ii)   a tariff study based on conventional cost-of-service
principles and the development of a fuel adjustment clause.
In January 1975, ENEE raised tariffs 25Z and inaugurated the
fuel adjustment. Implementation of these measures was a
condition of presentation of the Sixth Power Loan.
(iii) geothermal investigations of the Pavana and San Ignacio
sites carried out by a firm which went bankrupt and later by
personnel supplied by the United Nations. Budgeting
constraints have led to postponement of further drilling
required for the project.
3.3.4     The load dispatch facility was an expansion of the original concept
of installing communications and control equipment at the Pavana and Suyapa
substations. The facility was needed in connection with the expected growth
of interchange operations with INE. Subsequently, there were various delays
in completing the feasibility study. As interchange operations have been at
a low level, ENEE has moved slowly to complete the facility (sometime in
1985).
3.4       Sixth Power Project:  Changes, Costs, and Timetable
3.4.1     Additions to the Sixth Power Project included:  (a)  extension of
35 kV lines from Mochito to Nispero; and (b) consulting services for (i) a
study of woodwaste use for electricity production; (ii) preparation of an
inspection manual for hydraulic works; (iii) studies of geology, water
management, cost and scheduling of Cajon project. The Bank agreed to these
changes which led to new completion dates for the Project, revisions of the
Project description in the Loan Agreement, and a new closing date for the
Loan Agreement: December 31, 1981 vs. December 31, 1979.
3.4.2     Primarily because of limited geological investigations at the
feasibility stage, substantial redesign of specific civil-works items
(diversion structures at Rio Lindo, Varsovia, and Yure) was required duriug
construction. Because of the design changes, ENEE and Bank staff were not
fully satisfied with the performance of the consultant. Fortunately, due to
off-setting cost increases and decreases, especially for the civil works and
the penstock, the actual and forecast costs (in current prices) of the Rio
Lindo extension were close: US$40.8 million vs. US$39.03 million (including
the costs of extension works financed by CABEI). As ENEE has not provided
annual expenditure data for the Project before 1977, this report does not
include a schedule comparing the actual and forecast costs of the extension
works in constant prices (which could be expected to show a modest cost
underrun).



- ii -
3.4.3     Because of the addition of new items (para. 3.4.1) to the Project
cost, it is not meaningful to compare the final cost (US$45.0 million) of all
items financed by the Bank with that expected at appraisal (US$ 41.3
million). Excluding the addition of the new items, the final cost was about
US$41.8 million, which was close to the appraisal forecast.  Because of the
difficulty of maintaining cost records on project components which were
heterogeneous by their nature, ENEE supplied no cost data on the
distribution-expansion and rural-electrification components, which CABEI and
ENEE were expected to finance respectively.  Bank staff made virtually no
effort to supervise these components.
3.4.4     The original Project items were completed close to the original
Project date of December 31, 1978. The sub-transmission line between Nispero
and Mochito was completed in 1982. The additional studies on Cajon were
completed in 1978; those on wood waste, in 1980.
3.4.5     Collaboration between Bank and ENEE staff during the implementation
of this Project was close and cordial. ENEE's performance was professional
and satisfactory.
3.4.6     Annexes 11, 12, 13, and 14 compare actual and forecast data on,
respectively, Project cost, completion and implementation dates, allocation
of loan proceeds, and cumulative disbursements.
3.5       Sixth Power Project:  Studies and Training
3.5.1     The original studies of the Project - tariffs, budget control,
small hydro sites, hydro power at Remolino and/or eastern Honduras - were
carried out just about on schedule and close to the original cost forecast.
The major hydro power studies led to justification of the Nispero project
(Loan 1629-HO). The small hydro power studies have led to further
consideration of several sites but not to construction planning in the
near-term. Tariff consultants proposed a marginal-cost-based tariff
structure in 1979, which the Bank and ENEE accepted. With some
modifications, ENEE introduced corresponding changes in its tariff structure
in 1980. Consultants recommended a series of budget-control procedures in
1978, which ENEE implemented after discussion with the Bank. Later, ENEE
extended this contract to improve its commercial practices in order to
reduce the overdue accounts receivable of private customers. The additional
study of the Cajon project helped in preparation of that project. The use of
wood waste for electricity generation has not led to near-term construction
plans, as ENEE is still evaluating its generation needs and the availability
of adequate wood waste supplies. ENEE and Bank staff were satisfied with the
performance of the various consultants in connection with the above studies.
3.5.2     In connection with the study of small hydro sites, consultants
provided a group of ENEE engineers with training in the areas of power system
planning, system operation, and maintenance of diesel, gas turbine, and hydro
power plants. During the period of project construction, ENEE established a
training center near Tegucigalpa (La Leona); and continued to send engineers
(about 15) outside Honduras for additional training.

3.6       Project Operations:  Fifth and Sixth Power Projects
3.6.1     Except for the La Ceiba diesels, which have experienced operating
problems due to the high vanadium content of bunker C fuel available in
Honduras, the major generation and transmission works built under both
projects have operated satisfactorily. Annex 15 sets forth operating data on
the La Ceiba diesels.
IV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1       Fifth Power Project:  Justification
4.1.1     The Fifth Power Project, especially the interconnection
transmission line, was part of a least-cost joint development program
(para.2.1.6) to meet the expected load growth in Honduras and Nicaragua for
discount rates up to 20%. According to the appraisal report, even if the
Cajon project were postponed for a few years, the interconnection
transmission line would permit both companies to exchange emergency power and
to combine their reserves.
4.1.2     Central to the justification of the joint development program were
tne expected load growths in both countries and the cost estimates for the
Cajon Project. These expectations were substantially reversed by subsequent
events which could not have been foreseen. Because of the marginal economic
justification of the Cajon Project in 1973, there was a lengthy deferral of
construction of the Cajon project (paras 2.3.1 and 3.2.4) (see Appendix I for
ENEE's comments on delay of Cajon Project). During the years 3972-1976, the
original period of project execution, sales growth in Honduras and Nicaragua
lagged expectations. For ENEE, the actual growth rate was 13.7% annually as
compared with an expected growth rate of 20.8%. The most important factor
adversely affecting growth was the shortfall of sales to the fruit companies
(para 3.2.3). On a secondary level, other factors also adversely affected
sales growth -- the economic stagnation due in part to the lingering impact
of the 1969 war with El Salvador, a world-wide recession, and the damage to
agricultural districts caused by Hurricane Fifi.  The combination of these
factors lessened ENEE's need to purchase energy from INE's new steam plant
(2 x 50HW) at Puerto Tiscuco which was almost ready for commercial operations
when the interconnection transmission line was commissioned in September
1976.
4.1.3     After commissioning, the transmission line linking Tegucigalpa and
Choluteca provided substantial benefits by permitting a rapid increase of
sales in the Choluteca area: between 1976 and 1979, sales in this area rose
about-84X to almost 24 GWh (3% of ENEE's total sales). But due to a
combination of market and political factors, there has been a substantial
underutilization of that portion of the line connecting Choluteca with Leon
in Nicaragua, notwithstanding some improvements in continuity of service
(para 3.2.6).
4.1.4     The staff appraisal report included no calculation on the internal
rate of return on the Project. Given the many changes to the Project (paras.
3.1.1-2.) and the substitution of the Rio Lindo expansion project for the
Cajon project as ENEE's next generation addition following completion of the
Fifth Power Project, this report includes a calculation of the internal rate
of return on ENEE's investment program for the period 1972-1979 (see below).



-.                                  - 13 -
4.2       Sixth Power Project:  Justification
4.2.1     The appraisal report for the Sixth Power Project stated that the
Rio Lindo extension was the least-cost method for meeting ENEE's expected
load growth for discount rates up to about 20%. The internal return on the
project was estimated at about 22.3%.
4.2.2     The appraisal report contains different sets of sales projections.
Sales projections for the economic justification of the Project (Annex 16)
indicate cumulative sales for the period 1974-1978 of 2,722.3 GWh; sales
projection for the financial forecast reflect cumulative sales of 2,663.8
GWh. The difference in sales projections reflects a difference in the
approach of power engineers and financial analysts. To be conservative, a
power engineer must orient his power planning to meet a maximum expected
load. In contrast, to be conservative, a financial analyst must orient his
financial planning on a lower expected load. Actual cumulative 1974-1978
sales (2,502 GWh) were reasonably close to the sales forecast of the
financial projections (a difference of 6.1%). Depressed economic conditions
in 1974-1975 plus Hurricane Fif-i adversely affected ENEE's domestic sales
levels until 1976, resulting in annual growth rates of only 9.9% as compared
with the appraisal forecast of 12.2%. Thereafter, sales growth was strong --
about 13% annnually through 1979 (as compared with the appraisal forecast of
about 10% annually). In connection with the Nispero power project (1629-HO),
ENEE substantially improved its forecasting methodology: actual cumulative
sales for the period 1978-1981 were less than 3% below the cumulative
forecast level (2,946 GWh vs. 3,036 GWh). ENEE credited the irvroved
forecasting to its staff, who had greater familiarity with Honduras than a
foreign consultant (see Appendix I for ENEE's comments).
4.2.3     The appraisal report stated that the Rio Lindo extension was the
least-cost alternative as compared with various alternative layouts of the
diversion works; and the least-cost alternative as compared with medium-speed
diesels providing the same generation. Because the actual and forecast costs
of the Rio Lindo extension were close (para. 3.4.2), and given the large
increase in real terms of the price of fuel, as compared with the appraisal
estimate, the extension remains the least-cost alternative.
4.2.4     Annex 18 sets forth the internal rate of return on ENEE's
investment program for the period 1972-1978. The return was about 11.7%,
indicating that tariff levels in 1979 were about adequate.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1       Actual and Appraisal Forecast Financial Data, 1972-1979
5.1.1     Annexes 19 to 22 compare actual and appraisal data for the years
1972 and 1979 in the areas of: key financial ratios, income statements,
funds statements, and balance sheets. Forecast data for 1972 and 1973 were
taken from the appraisal report for the Fifth Power Project; data for
1974-1979, the appraisal report for the Sixth Power Project.



- 14 -
5.2       Actual and Appraisal Forecast Financial Performance, 1972 - 1979
5.2.1     ENEE's financial performance was marginally satisfactory, if
different from what was expected at appraisal. The rate of return results
were significantly affected by the asset valuation criterion used. Before
1979, ENEE valued its assets at original cost revalued to 1973 prices. On
this basis, its return on net average assets was close to 10% each year.
On annually revalued assets, its annual average return was 6.4% (as compared
with the convenanted return of 10%). Neverthless, these shortfalls in the
rate of return did not adversely affect the progress of construction of
either the Fifth or the Sixth Power Projects. Because of delayed tariff
increases, there was some deterioration in summary ratios for debt-service
coverage (1.5 times vs. 1.9 times), operations (60.5% vs. 47.8%), and working
capital (1.1 vs. 1.5); but because of the deferral of the Cajon project,there
was some improvement in summary ratios for contribution to investment (23.7Z
vs. 13.6%) and debt-to-total capital (55/45 vs. 66/34). There was also some
improvement in the receivables ratio (equivalent to 68 days of sales in 1979)
but less than expected (equivalent to 52 days of sales in 1979).
5.2.2     Set forth below is a summary table comparing actual and forecast
data stated in 1974 prices. Because of the deferral of the Cajon project,
the actual and forecast financing plans are not comparable. However, actual and
forecast summary sales and operating results are comparable. Because actual
summary sales were 6.7% less than expected (paras. 4.1.2 and 4.2.2) and
because ENEE was slow to increase tariffs, operating revenues (L 309.2
million) were 16.5% less than expected; and because operating expenses (L
134.0 million) were 6.6% greater than expected, operating income (L 175.2
million) was 28.4% less than expected.
5.2.3     Certain factors worked in ENEE's favor to keep operating costs
close to the appraisal forecasts. For example, the actual summary fuel
expense (L 36.5 million) exceeded the appraisal forecast by only 11.6%
because of lower-than-expected sales and generation; and ENEE had success in
the area of salary administration, even though the actual number of employees
exceeded the appraisal estimates. At appraisal, ENEE's staff numbers were
expected to rise 3.5% annually between 1974 and 1979, resulting in a
customer/employee ratio of 84 by 1979. ENEE's numbers of employed staff
actually rose at a rate of 4.5% annually, resulting in a customer/employee
ratio of 71. ENEE compensated for these increases in staff by holding the
line on salary increases.  In 1974 prices, ENEE's wage bill, L 10.6 million,
was actually lower than expected at appraisal, L 11.0 million. ENEE's
customer/employee ratio is currently at an acceptable level (93).
5.3       Tariff Increases and ENEE's Compliance with Revenue Covenants
5.3.1     The dramatic increase of fuel costs (in 1973) required ENEE to take
tariff action in order to avoid an undermining of its financial position.
ENEE complied with the conditions of Board presentation for Loan 1081-HO -
raising tariffs 25% and instituting a fuel adjustment clause (para 2.36),
based on the findings of a tariff study (para. 3.3.3). Later, it revalued its
operating assets to a 1973 price level. With some delay, ENEE implemented

the fuel adjustment clause in 1977 when fuel costs rose notably in the
operating cost mix. Since then, ENEE increased its tariffs by 10X in June
1978 and 12% in May 1979. In 1979, it implemented a procedure for the annual
revaluation of assets. In 1980, ENEE again raised tariffs 12%. During the
years 1972-1979, Bank staff were generally satisfied with ENEE's compliance
with the revenue covenants of the Fifth and Sixth Power Loan Agreements.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1       Collaboration of Bank and KNEE Staff
6.1.1     The collaboration of Bank and ENEE staff was cordial, professional,
and satisfactory. Each group complemented the work of the other, especially
in responding to the changing circumstances of the Fifth and Sixth Power
Projects (paras 3.1.1).
5.2       Performance of ENEE Staff
6.2.1     ENEE's construction department showed deepening maturity in the
conduct of its operations. ENEE enjoyed the benefits of high-caliber top
management during the implementation of these projects.
6.2.2     Improvements in administrative efficiency have come slowly. ENEE
brought its customer/employee ratio in line with appraisal forecasts for the
Cajon project (para. 5.2.3); but internal reports have been delayed from time
to time because of inadequate computer capacity. Inventories and accounts
receivable have consistently exceeded appraisal forecasts. With the
prompting of Bank staff, ENEE is planning to acquire additional computer
capacity and has accepted consultant recommendations for re-organizing and
up-grading the financial and administrative functions (especially inventory
management). Because the Government has been a slow payer of its bills,
significant progress in reducing overdue receivables would require Government
co-operation in the formulation and enforcement of a payments plan as applied
to itself and its entities. Government cooperation would also be required to
speed up collections from certain corporations. ENEE has delayed
implementing management improvements of the administrative and financial
functions because of budgetary and staff constraints. If necessary, Bank
staff should condition its next lending operation to the taking of
appropriate remedial action by the Government (bills) and ENEE
(administrative improvements).
6.3       Performance of Bank Staff
6.3.1     At appraisal of the Fifth Power Project, Bank staff did not assess
the risks to the Project in the event of adverse market developments or
increases ef the cost estimate for the Cajoa project (para 2.1.7). However,
Bank staff showed excellent flexibility during supervision of the Project
(para. 3.1.1). At appraisal of the Sixth Power Project, Bank staff accepted
cost estimates for the pipeline and penstock which far exceeded the actual
cost. Fortunately, this over-estimation offset an under-estimation of the



- 17 -
cost of civil works (para. 3.4.2).  Bank staff made virtually no effort to
supervise the distribution portion of the Project, which was financed by
CABEI (para. 2.3.4). The financial measures required in connection with
Board presentation of the Sixth Power Loan helped ENEE to avoid financing
shortfalls which could have delayed project execution (paras. 2.4.1 and
5.3.1).
6.4       Performance of Consultant Staff
6.4.1     With one exception, ENEE was satisfied with the performance of
consultants in connection with studies carried out under the Fifth and Sixth
Power Projects. ENEE was not satisfied with the geological investigations
for the Rio Lindo expansion. Bank staff share this complaint.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1       Project Justification:  Fifth Power Project
7.1.1     This Project illustrates the risks of justifying a major project
component on the basis of a second project, for which not even a feasibility
study exists. The '.terconnection transmission line was built on the
expectation that ENEE would build the Cajon project before it had been
demonstrated that Cajon was the next least-cost generation addition. Actual
events contradicted these developments. Later, the interconnection was
justified as part of a lesser-cost joint development sequence which did not
include construction of the Cajon project as ENEE's next least-cost
generation addition (para. 3.2.2). Market and other factors have combined to
cause the interconnection to be an underutilized, if useful, facility (para.
3.2.5). ENEE stated that feasibility study did not take into account such
factors as emergency energy, system stability, reserve sbaring, and future
interconnections in Central America (see Annendix I for ENE.E's comments).
7.2       Project Appraisal:  Sixth Power Project
7.2.1     The differences between the actual and forecast costs of the Rio
Lindo expansion (para. 3.4.2) confirm the wisdom of the Bank's delaying Board
presentation of projects with a large civil-works component until the
appraisal mission reviews detailed designs and corresponding cost estimates
(para. 2.3.4).

Dear Mr. Kapur:
Thank you for forwarding the evaluation report for the loans granted
by the World Bank to ENEE (841-HO and 1081-HO), which report I found to
contain considerable de-ail. I have only the following comments to make.
LAC Region Note:           In 2.1.1, it is stated that the original cost of the El Caj6rn
Para.2.1.1 of   project was estimated at US$85 million, i.e. US$170 per kW.  It should be

preparing
estimates of    Alternatives"' was drafted, from which were derived the so-called "El Caj6n

cost of          Chico" and "El Caj6n Grande" projects with capacities of 146 SW and 200 MW

respectively, and at a cost of US$254 and US$319 per kW, respectively.  This
should also have been mentioned in 2.1.8 since at the time vhen the El Caj6n
project was designed in 1970, there was no talk of any interconnection between
Honduxas arnd Nicaragua.
LAC Region Note:           In 2.3.1, it. is stated that in December 1972, the ENEE consultant
Paras.2.3.1,    considered that, dtue to the increased project cost, it would be better to

evaluation has shown that the damage to the economy would have been far
greater than the cost of the interconnection project. Furthermore, starting
in March 1983, energy purchases by Honduras through the interconnection system
have reached some 30 MW to 50 MW per month.
LAC Project Note:           In 3.3.1, it is again stated that the consultant's study showed that
3.3.1 and 4 1.2  a thermal plant would be a better alternative than the El Caj6n project, which

paras.2.3.1 and
2.3.2             account of additional geological and technical studies requested by the World
Bank and IDB.

couments.         than this; in fact at the time when it was prepared, the feasibility study for
the interconnection was based only on guaranteed energy exchanges and did not
take into consideration such aspects as emergency energy, system stability,
the sharing of reserves and future interconnections in Central America.
A further point worth underscoring is that mentioned in 4.2.2 in
connection with project 1629-HO, to the effect that forecasting methodology
has been substantially improved. The forecasts in question were prepared by
ENEE staff, who are of course more familiar with the situation in the country
than the consultant.
