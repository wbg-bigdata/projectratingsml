INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENERGIA ELECTRICA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF HONDURAS
FOR A FIFTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report aind recommendation on a proposed loan to
*Empresa Nacional de Energia El6ctrica (ENEE) with the guarantee of the Republic
of Honduras for the equivalent of $12.3 million to help finance a power project.
The loan would have a term of 24 years, including a four year grace period with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annuam. The proposed Loan and Guarantee Agreements
incorporate certain changes, which are explained in paragraphs 37 and 38, in the
Fourth Power Project financed under Loan 692-HO and Credit 201-HO.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Recent Developments and Prospects
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Honduras"
was distributed to the Executive Directors in September 1969. A recent report,
based on the findings of an economic mission which visited Honduras in October
and November 1971, will be available for distribution to the Executive Directors
early in FY1973. The main recommendations of this report are the need to restore
fiscal equilibrium, the urgency of Honduras' negotiating a reasonable basis for
renewed full participation in the Central American Common Market (CACM), and the
importance of policies to diversify the economy, especially through government
action to encourage forestry. A country data sheet is attached as Annex II.
3.        Honduras is a small open economy, heavily dependent on the export of
bananas, although a modest degree of diversification has taken place in the last
decade through the development of new export products such as meat, simple man-
ufactures, cotton and tobacco. Its resources are rather limited. It consists
mainly of the fertile coastal plain in the north, a few fertile valleys in the
east, and extensive but largely unexploited natural pine forests. Known mineral
deposists are not extensive; they include silver, lead and zinc, which have been
exploited on a small scale for decades, and low-grade iron ore. Although the
average population-to-land ratio is favorable, population has traditionally
concentrated in the mountainous west, the poorest area of the country, and
on the north coastal plain. In the future, as population pressure increases in
these areas, heavy investment in physical infrastructure will be necessary to
facilitate the population of areas further to the east. This process has
already started as the road network was improved and expanded in recent years.



-.2 
It.       With a per capita income of $275 in 1971, Honduras is the poorest
country in Central America. Growth has not been smooth: although real GDP
rose at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent in the 1960's, much of this
expansion took place in 1964-68, on the basis of substantial investment and
subsequent large increases in output and export of bananas. Since then the
economy has been in recession, per capita income has stagnated, and the bal-
ance of payments has weakened considerably. Several factors have contrib-
uted to the recession, including severe hurricane damage to banana and other
crops in 1969, coinciding with the war between Honduras and El Salvador and
the consequent reduction in private investment; the withdrawal by Honduras
from the free trade arrangements of the Central American Common Market (CACM),
a move which has adversely affected a number of export industries; and,
finally, the weakening of banana export prices in 1971.
5.        Relations with the other members of the CACM are important: the
CACM absorbed Honduran exports of staples which have no ready market else-
where, and it provided the additional markets necessary for the establish-
ment of factories making textiles, clothing, chemicals and metal products.
The Honduran authorities felt, however, that the benefits of CACM did not
offset the higher cost of imports together with the revenue loss arising from
regional free trade. The other members of CACM recognize the validity of
Honduran complaints about past trading arrangements. A number of proposals
have been informally discussed in the CACM, but so far no agreement has been
reached between Honduras and the other coantries, partly because of the bor-
der dispute with El Salvador. The delay in arriving at a formula for renewed
trade relations between Honduras and the rest of Central America is adversely
affecting Honduras' agriculture and industry. At the present time the Common
Market Secretariat ('SIECA) is eompleting a study of possible arrangements to
reestablish regional free trade.
6.        During most of the 1960ts, the Government carried out many schemes
essential for economic growth. Among the major achievements in this period
were the establishment of a basic transport network connecting the main popu-
lation centers, the provision of electric power and telecommunications ser-
vices, and the doubling of primary school enrollment. Until 1968, there were
no financial difficulties in carrying forward these schemes, mainly because
of the fast growth of government revenues based on the introduction of a general
sales tax and higher income tax rates in 1964, and larger tax payments by the
banana companies.  Since 1969, however, the public sector has experienced a
sharp deterioration in its finances, initially because of defense and other
emergency expenditures connected with the 1969 border war with El Salvador,
and later because the normal growth of government current expenditures out-
stripped that of current revenues.  Public sector savings declined from an
average of 2.7 percent of GDP in 1966-68 to 1.6 percent of GDP in 1969-71.
In spite of this, the public sector maintained an impressive investment
effort with the average investment ratio rising from 3.6 to 6.2 percent of
GDP over the same period. A large increase in net foreign financing did
not cover the overall public sector budget deficit, and the Central Bank was
required to finance the gap, equivalent to about 1.5 percent of GDP in
1969-71.



-3-
7.        The Honduran Government is at present preparing a development plan
including a public investment.program for the next five years.  The Bank's
recent economic mission has analyzed the Government's draft investment pro-
gram, which continues to stress investment in physical infrastructure,
particularly transport awnd power, but also includes a substantial increase
in investment in the social sectors such as education and water supply and
in directly productive sectors, giving special emphasis to agricultural
diversification.  The implementation of such a program would result in an
increase in public investment to about 8 percqnt of GDP in 1975-77. However,
there may be a shortage of public savings. The fiscal gap which emerged
in the last two years is manageable, but action on the revenue side will
be required to maintain growth. The additional taxes required represent
one percent on GDP in the coming year, with a second increase equivalent to
an additional one percent of GDP two years later, as public investment
proceeds faster. On such a basis, public savings could be expected to
increase from their present level of 1.6 percent of GDP to over 3 percent
in the mid-1970's, and the share of investment financed by these savings
would be close to 40 percent compared to about one-third in recent years.
8.        In the medium term, the Government must take the initiative to
revitalize the economy, owing to the rather poor outlook for the major
exports - bananas and coffee - which largely determine economic growth.
The public investment program would thus be an important factor in giving
momentum to the economy; in addition, the Government needs to stimulate
private investment.  The forestry sector offers the best opportunity for
the medium-term diversification of production and exports.  Honduras has
the largest pine forests in Central America, and would have a market for
pulp and paper prodacts in the requirements of the neighboring countries
for cardboard boxes used in exporting bananas. Various institutional
difficulties inhibit the prompt establishment of such an industry, but an
imaginative approach, perhaps drawing together capital from other Central
American countries, could help overcome some of these problems.
External Finance
9.        The external lending agencies have strongly supported public
investment in Honduras. Outstainding external public debt, including
debt repayable in local currency, increased from $32 million at the end of
1959 to $205 at the end of 1970. Honduras' major external creditor is the
World Bank Group, which accounted for almost one half of external public
debt outstanding - including undisbursed - repayable in foreign currency
on December 31, 1970. Other. important creditors are USAID, the Inter-
American Davelopment Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration (CABEI). USAID has financed education, health, feeder roads,
water supply, and silo construction for an agricultural commodity price
stabilization program, and it was also instrumental in the formation of a
private industrial finance company. IDB has been involved in housing,
education, water and sewerage and, to a lesser extent, highways. It also
supports agricultural and industrial projects by means of general credit



lines to the publicly-owned development bank. The bulk of CABEI lending has
been for projects with a regional impact in transportation, industry and
telecommunications, but it has also financed housing. AID loans normally
have been for a term of 40 years with interest of 2 - 3 percent, and most
IDB loans have been from the Fund for Special Operations carrying 3-4 per-
cent interest and terms ranging from 15 to 30 years. The terms of CABEI
loans, which often finance 100 percent of the total cost of projects, have
varied in accordance with CABEI's own source of financing, but they nor-
mally have contained a substantial concessionary element. Lending commit-
ments by the major external agencies active in Honduras are summarized in
the table below:

j  includes foreign exchange loans repayable in local currency.
IDB and CABEI are expected to continue financing projects in the sectors which
they have supported in the past. USAID, on the other hand, may concentrate its
future lending in agriculture, depending on the results of an ongoing sector
survey which it is financing.
10.       Since its poverty and uncertain balance of payments prospects make
it difficult for Honduras - one of the least developed countries in Latin
America - to borrow substantial amounts on conventional terms, external
agencies have extended financial assistance on fairly soft terms even though
debt service, while it has risen significantly in the last few years, is
still low. It would be desirable if future assistance could also be on
concessionary terms and, accordingly, I hope to be able to present for your
consideration an IDA credit to finance education during the next fiscal year.



-5-
However, Honduras does have some margin for borrowing on conventional terms;
assuming that the average terms of external borrowing were to remain more
or less the same as in the past, the debt service ratio would rise to about
6.5 percent by the end of the decade. This would be within manageable
limits for an econaay such as Honduras, which can therefore be regarded as
creditworthy for the proposed loan.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN HONDURAS
11.       Honduras has to date received ten Bank loans totalling $58.1
million and five IDA credits totalling $24.0 million, both net of cancel-
lations, making a total of $82.1 million.  At the end of April, the Bank
and IDA held about $71 million, including $19 million not yet disbursed.
The latest operation, a loan for ports, was signed in June 1971. The
proposed loan is the only operation in Honduras to be presented for your
consideration during the current fiscal year.
12.       Execution of Bank Group financed projects has, on the whole, been
satisfactory, although there have been delays in implementing a highway pro-
ject and difficulties with a port loan.  Annex I contains a summary state-
ment of Bank loans and IDA credits as of April 30, 1972, as well as notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Bank and IDA lending has been heavily concentrated on transport
and power, where there are still substantial deficiencies to be made good.
The first livestock development credit approved in 1970, however, marked
the beginning of a major diversification in lending. The proposed lending
program would support the priorities of the Government's investment plan,
by continuing to strengthen physical infrastructure and giving increased
emphasis to investment in social and directly productive sectors.
14.       In transport this means continuing to assist the Government to
complete highway links between the main regions of the country, but also
assisting in the construction of a network of feeder and access roads to
support agricultural development. Thus, a road project now under preparation
would finance the construction of the first main highway to eastern Honduras
as well as access roads in the area, potentially one of the most productive
in the country. At the same time, the proposed loan and a further loan for
power contemplated for FY197h, would have as a principal objective the pro-
gressive integration of the power system of Honduras with the power systems
of other Central American countries. Some assistance to the Government in
its rural electrification program is also in prospect.
15.       Over the past two years the Bank has been working closely with the
Government to develop programs in education and agriculture. At the request of
the Government, a UNESCO mission - under the Cooperative Program - has identified
technical and vocational education, including teacher-training, as areas



-6-
which have long been neglected and which deserve the highest priority. Dis-
cussions are under way with the Government on a first education project to be
financed by the Bank Group. The objective of lending for agriculture is
to assist in diversifying the economy and developing competitive exports of
high value products. A second livestock project, which is now under prepa-
ration, would be broader in scope than the first, including financing for
dairying, pig production and slaughterhouses, and a large component of
technical assistance to train local technicians in livestock production and
help small farmers to participate in the project. In irrigation, an IBRD/FAO
mission has identified several possible projects for Bank financing but further
preparation work is still needed.
16.      IFC has participated in two projects in Honduras.  A total of
$378,000 was invested in a leather tanning project in 1964 and 1966. The
more important operation, in terms of its potential contribution to Honduras'
long-term economic development, is a pilot project for a pulp and paper
industry to utilize the wood resources of the Olancho Reserve.  A pilot
company, Compaflia Celulosa de Centro America S.A. (COPINO;), was established
in June 1968, under the leadership of International Paper Company (IPO), to
investigate and possibly carry out a project. IFC invested $75,000 in COPINO
in 1969 and 1970. After IPC discontinued its participation in COPINO in March
1971, the Government requested IFC's assistance in seeking a new technical
partner and formulating a new financial plan for the project. Before taking
further steps to promote the project, IFC is awaiting the outcome of a govern-
ment sponsored proposal to rescind a provision in the recently enacted
forestry law which in its present form would require majority ownership by
the Government of any enterprise engaged in exploiting forest resources.
Annex I contains a summary of IFC investments as of April 30, 1972.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
Background
17.      Development of public electrical services in Honduras has lagged
behind the rapidly growing needs of agriculture and industry, sectors which
play an important role in the country's economic growth. Generation doubled
in the past five years, but electricity is available only in a few parts of
the country, and where available it is quite expensive. Annual electricity
consumption of 116 kwh per capita is the lowest in Central America, where
average consumption ranges from 124 kwh to 500 kwh per year in the other
countries.
18.      The Empresa Nacional de Energ{a Electrica (ENEE), a public enter-
prise, supplies 85 percent of total electricity available for public supply,
and serves approximately 60,000 customers. The United Fruit and Standard
Fruit Companies own the largest private utilities, which account for another
13 percent of total electricity available; the remainder is supplied by local
municipal systems.
19.      The Bank Group has been associated with the development of the Hon-
duran power sector since 1959; it was instrumental in building and improving
ENEE, and with four loans and two credits totalling $32.8 million has



7-
provided the bulk of financing required to implement ENEE's expansion plans.
The Rio Lindo Hydroelectric Project (Third Power Project), which is sub-
stantially ccmpleted, expanded substantially ENEE's hydroelectric generating
capacity and distribution system. The Fourth Power Project, currently being
implemented, will further strengthen the main system and extend it to several
small cities in the northern and central zones. The Bank has also worked
with ENEE in designing a rural electrification program, implementation of
which is expected to start in 1974. A special fund has been set up to finance
this program mainly with funds from the Government which will be derived from
the spread between the terms of IDA Credit 201-HO  (for the Fourth Power Project)
and the terms on which the funds are relent to ENEE.
20.      ENEE's main system serves the most heavily populated and industrial-
ized section of the country, stretching from the San Pedro Sula area in the
north to the capital city of Tegucigalpa in the central zone. The system
presently consists of six power plants (two hydro, three diesel and one gas
turbine) with an installed capacity of 105 MW and 274 km of transmission
lines. In addition to its main system, ENEE operates 14 isolated diesel
plants with a total installed capacity of 6.2 MW.
21.      ENEE's sales are expected to increase by about 21 percent per year
in 1971-76, compared to 16 percent during the past five years. The increase
in the rate of growth of sales is mainly due to the expansion of ENEE's system
into areas which at present do not receive electricity.  Moreover, the
unsatisfied demand for power in areas presently served remains high,and sales
in these areas are expected to increase at an annual rate of 15 percent over
the next five years. Industrial customers, which accounted for 54 percent of
ENEE's sales in 1970, have requested more power from ENEE to replace their
own inefficient captive plants, and new medium-sized factories under
construction will further increase demand. Unsatisfied demand for residen-
tial use is also high, with less than 15 percent of potential residential
consumers being provided with electricity.
The Honduras-Nicaragua Interconnection
22.      The proposed project would be the first step in the coordinated
development program of the Honduran and Nicaraguan power sectors based on
interconnection and - in the longer run - in the integrated power development
of the whole Central American region. The Bank is encouraging this strategy,
and discussions of further interconnection links are currently under way
between other Central American countries.
23.      Honduras has abundant hydroelectric resources.  The most attractive
of its studied sites appears to be El Cajon on the Humuya River. The feasibi-
lity study for this project has not been campleted, but preliminary findings
indicate that a hydroelectric plant at El Caj6n, with an estimated capacity
of about 450 MW, would generate about 1,300 GWH of low-cost energy yearly,
and would have considerable flood control benefits in the Sula Valley, one
of the richest agricultural zones in the country.



2h.      Despite its rapid growth, the Honduran market is not expected to be
large enough to justify construction of El Cajon until the mid-1980's.
Neighboring Nicaragua, however, has a much larger market for electricity and
is becoming increasingly dependent on expensive thermal generation because iden-
tification of its major hydroelectric resources is in its early stages.
25.      The Honduran and Nicaraguan utilities have therefore developed,
with the assistance of the Bank, a combined program for development of their
power sectors. The first stage includes construction of thermal power
stations and extension of transmission lines in Honduras and Nicaragua, and
interconnection of the. power systems of the two countries. A second stage
includes construction of the El CaJ6n hydroelectric plant in Honduras,
scheduled to be commissioned in 1978. Under the proposed program, Nicaragua
would sell thermal power to Honduras from 1975 through 1977, an& Honduras
would sell hydroelectric power to Nicaragua from 1978 onward. To provide for the
exchange of power, the Honduran and Nicaraguan Governments have signed a
treaty to record their agreement to interconnect their power systems and to.
authorize the respective power agencies to take the necessary action. A
contract for the sale of power by ENALUF (the Nicaraguan power agency) to
ENEE during 1975-77 is expected to be aigned in June.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.      The project was appraised in the field in October 1971.  Negotiations
for the proposed loan were held in Washington in April 1972. ENEE was repre-
sented by Messrs. Dalmiro Caballero, Manager, Luis Cosenza, Technical Assistant
to the Manager and Cesar Batres, Legal Advisor. The Government. was represented
by Mr. Roberto Galvez, Ambassador of Honduras to the United States.
Project Description and Financing Plan
27.      A report entitled "Appraisal of Fifth Power Project -t Honduras,
Honduras-Nicaragua Interconnection, Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica
(ENEE)t? (PU-9oa, dated June 2, 1972)is being distributed separately. The main
features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III.
28.      The Fifth Power Project includes, in addition to transmission and
generating equipment needed to supply the rapidly growing damestic demand for
energy in rural and urban areas, the Honduran portion of the interconnection
between the power systems of Honduras and Nicaragua. It is closely related
to the proposed Eighth Power Project in Nicaragua, which is also being pre-
sented for your consideration today. The project consists of:
a) installation of four 6MW diesel generating units at La Ceiba,
an important city on the Caribbean Coast;
b)  construction of a 150 Im 230 kv transmission line from the
capital city, Tegucigalpa, to a growing center in the south,
Choluteca, and then to the Nicaraguan border, and substation
equipment at Tegucigalpa and Choluteca;



-9-
c)  construction of a 47 km 138 kv transmission line from La Ceiba to
the fertile Aguan Valley, now being colonized, installation of a
substation at Coyoles, a terminal at la Ceiba, and construction of
about 90 km of 34.5 kv subtransmi.ssion lines in the Aguan Valley;
d)  construction of about 150 km of 34.5 kv subtransmission
lines and installation of substations to serve new areas;
e)  studies of hydroelectric power projects on the Rio Jicatuyo and
conclusion of the feasibility study of the El Caj6n hydroelectric
project;
f)  preliminary survey of hydroelectric resources in eastern
Honduras, particularly on the Rio Patuca; and
g)  a training program for ENEE's staff.
The project would be carried out during 1972-75.
29.      The project is estimated to cost a total of $16.0 million equivalent;
the proposed loan of $12.3 million would cover the foreign exchange cost of
the project. The project is part of a much larger expansion program for
1972-78 which also includes completion of the Rio Lindo and Fourth Power Pro-
jects, construction of El Caj6n Hydroelectric Project and associated transmis-
sion lines, execution of the rural electrification program indicated above,
and expansion of the existing distribution system, including acquisition of
existing systems owned by other companies and municipalities. Total cost of
the program is estimated at $138 million, about 35 percent of which is
expected to be generated from within the enterprise, 8 percent from the loan
proposed, 7 percent from already committed external loans, 47 percent from
future borrowings for the next power project and the remaining 3 percent
from the Central Bank and miscellaneous contributions.
Project Entity
30.      The &mpresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) was established by
law in 1957 as an autonomous authority wholly-owned by the Government, to be res-
ponsible for developing and operating power facilities in Honduras. It is a
well-managed utility. ENEE is governed by a five-member Board of Directors,
including the Minister of Communications and Transport, the Minister of
Natural Resources, and representatives of the Planning Council, the National
Development Bank and the private sector. A General Manager, appointed by the
Board, is responsible for all managerial and administrative functions. ENEE
employs about 1,100 permanent workers.
31.      With assistance from the Bank, ENEE's management and organization
have improved greatly over the past ten years, but its engineering staff still
needs strengthening. In order to assist ENEE in this task, the Bank has
financed out of Loan 692-Ho and Credit 201-HO (Fourth Power Project) the hiring
of engineers to train ENEE's staff, and would finance a training program for
technical staff out of the proposed loan.



- 10 -
Financial Position of the Borrower
32..     ENEE's financial position is sound and is expected to remain so.   The
rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation during the project
period 1972-75 is. estimated to be over 12 percent.  The Empresa has agreed to
maintain a rate of return of no less than 10 percent during th,e term of the
loan. ENEE's projected earnings and the rate of return should in,crease
markedly in 1976 and 1977, when the need for cash to cover the local currency
requirements of El Cajon will be greatest.
33.      Despite heavy borrowing to finance its large expansion program,
ENEE's debt/equity ratio, which is now 54/46, is expected to be a satisfactory
51/49 in 1978, thus lea,ving a fair margin for further borrowing.  ENEE's debt
service coverage by internal cash generation is also projected to, be satis-
factory,ranging from 1.9 in 1972 to 2.4 in 1978. ENEE has agreed not to
undertake any long-term debt without the Bank's prior appro,,v,>,unless net
revenues cover it,, debt service at least 1.4 times.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.      Go6ds financed by the Bank would be procured through international
competitive bidding. All bids will be evaluated on a c.i.f. basis. It is pro-
posed that up to $250,000 be reimbursed to ENEE from the proposed loan for
expenditures in respect of engineering services incurred between February 1,
1972 and the date of signing. Annex III summarizes the disbursement schedule
for the proposed loan.
Economic Justification
35.       'The project is technically sound and economically j,ustified.  With
interconnection, both Honduras and Nicaragua will be able to benefit from the
use of low cost hydropower produced at El Cajon. In addition, interconnection
would make it possible to interchange emergency power, and the combined re-
serve requirements of the interconnected system would be lower than for inde-
pendent systems. In the short term, moreover, ENEE, by purchasing power from
Nicaragua, will avoid costly investments in additional thermal capacity and
be able to place its less efficient diesels on stand-by, thus reducing invest-
ment and operating costs. The interconnection program is the least-cost
alternative for discount rates of up to 20 percent, as compared with the best
independent program for the Honduran and Nicaraguan power systems.
36.    - It is not possible to calculate the return on the diesel units to
be installed at La Ceiba because they are designed to serve principally as
stand-by units. They represent the least cost solution for providing ade-
quate stand-by capacity for discount rates up to 31 percent.  The extension
of power supply to. the Aguan Valley is the least cost solution to meet the
needs of the valley. The economic return of the line is about 17 percent,
on the conservative assumption that the price paid for electricity by the
consumers in the valley constitutes a minimum measure of economic benefits.



Changes in the Fourth Power Project (Loan 692-HO/Credit 201-HO)
37.      Engineering studies carried out after the signing of the Loan and
Credit Agreements suggested, partly because of the proposed interconnection
with Nicaragua, a number of modifications in the design of the project. The
principal changes consist of:
a) Adding of a 138 kv loop around San Pedro Sula, the most
important city in the north, and enlarging the North Sula
substation in order to improve the reliability of supply
in that area.
b)  Building an additional 138 kv substation and enlarging
two other substations in the Tegucigalpa area to increase
the reliability of its distribution system.
c)  Increasing the scope of the subtransmission system to
meet current demands.
d)  Deleting the 60 klc 69 kv transmission line from Tegucigalpa
to Choluteca in the south. This section is the first leg
of the high voltage interconnection line (230 kv). The
entire interconnection line will be financed out of the
proceeds of the proposed loan, thus simplifying procurement
procedures.
e) Deleting the La Ceiba-Aguan Valley line, because of delays
in concluding negotiations with the potential customers in
the valley. The area will be supplied by a 138 kv line
included in the proposed project.
38.      The following table summarizes the proposed physical and financial
changes in the Fourth Power Project. As shown below, these changes have not
resulted in anyF change in the total cost'of'the p'6oJect and hence there will
be no change in the amount of Loan 692-HO or Credit 201-HO.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.      The draft Loan Agreemient between the Bank and the Empresa Nacional de
Energia El6ctrica, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Hondu-
ras and the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution ap-
proving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
40.      In addition, to effect the amendments in the Fourth Power Project
(Loan No. 692-HO and IDA Credit No. 201-HO) as detailed in paragraphs 37-3b
above:
(a)  Section 9.01 of the proposed Loan Agreement deletes
paragraph (b) of Section 2.o4 of the Project Agree-
ment (Fourth Power Project) between the Bank, the
Association and ENEE, of June 24, 1970; and
(b)  Section 6.01 of the proposed Guarantee Agreement
sets out the changes being made in the Project
Description contained in Schedule 2 to the Loan
Agreement (Fourth Power Project) between the
Repuqblic of Honduras and the Bank, of June 24,
1970. By separate agreement with the Borrower,
the Project Description in IDA Credit No. 201-HO
is being amended to conform with such changes.
41.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
POWER
Rio Lindo Hydroelectric Project (Loan 541-HO/Credit i16-HO, signed in
June 1966) - Construction work on the project is almost complete and
the loan and credit should be fully disbursed by August 1972.
Fourth Power Project (Loan 692-HO/Credit 201-HO, signed in June 1970) -
Engineering studies carried out after the signing of the loan and credit
suggested, partly because of the proposed interconnection with Nicaragua,
a number of changes in the design of the project which made necessary
amending the original project description. The amendments have been
incorporated in the documents for the proposed loan. These changes have
delayed bid preparation and project construction by about six months, but
the project is still expected to be completed on schedule by June 30,
1974.
TRANSPORTATION
North Road Project (Loan 400-HO/Credit 71-HO, signed in February 1965) _
Project execution was delayed due to initial changes in alignment and
unusually heavy rains in 1968 and 1969; construction work on the pro-
ject is now virtually complete, but small disbursements on the loan are
expected to continue through December 1972.
Western Highway Paving Project (Loan 495-HO, signed in May 1967) -
Construction work on the project has been substantially completed and
the loan should be fully disbursed by August 1972.
Second Port Project (Loan 767-HO, signed in June 1971) -
Special problems have arisen in connection with this project. The ef-
fective date of the loan was postponed three times for a total of six
months, initially because of delays in presenting the loan documents to
Congress and subsequently because, partly for political reasons related
to the border issue with El Salvador, Congress expressed reservations
about the portion of the project involving the development of a new port
in the south of Honduras. The Government, the Port Authority and the
Bank have agreed to postpone the decision to construct the southern port
until further studies are completed.
AGRICULTURE
Livestock Development Project (Credit 179-HO, signed in March 1970) -
The project is somewhat behind schedule,because of initial problems in
organizing the project team and difficulties with project administration
procedures due to lack of experience. Processing of sub-loans is now
moving satisfactorily, but disbursements are still lagging, partly
because of difficulties in obtaining clear titles to land, which are
a condition for sub-loan signing.
