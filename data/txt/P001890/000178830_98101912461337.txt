POSTCRIPT
Subsequent to the analysis presented in this report and after
negotiations on this project, the Mauritian Rupee was devalued by twenty-three
percent (23%) against the SDR; the current rate of exchange is Rs. 7.7698 =
US$1.00. The devaluation would not affect DBM's foreign exchange resource
requirements. 1/ While it would cause DBM's debt/equity ratio 2/ to rise from
the 2.7:1 in FY1980 and 2.5:1 in FY1984 projected in the appraisal to 3.3:1 in
FY1980 and 3.0:1 in FY1984, the debt/equity position would still remain well
below the contractual limit of 4:1.  The devaluation could affect the quality
of DBM's portfolio. Ceteris paribus it would be expected that the performance
of export oriented enterprises would improve, with the resultant increased
competitiveness of Mauritian products, as would that of import substitution
firms, with increased rupee cost of competing imported goods. At the same
time, any firms relying substantially upon imported inputs may experience
financial problems, and their working capital requirements would need to be
carefully monitored. As far as prospects for future operations, increased
competitiveness should provide an inducement for new investment in export
enterprises.
1/   Local currency resource requirements may increase due to the increased
price of indirectly imported goods. However, this should pose no
problem for DBM as the Government in the past has consistently provided
DBM with requisite local currency funds and moreover has agreed, in the
context of the proposed Fifth Loan, to provide DBM with adequate local
currency funds to carry out its forecast operations.
2/   As defined in the Loan Agreement.

DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS (DBM)
I. INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A.   Sectoral Objectives and Policies
1.01      Introduction.  Historically, the economy of Mauritius has been
dependent on the sugar sector; however, in the last decade the Government has
sought to diversify the economy away from sugar, through development of its
industrial sector. This diversification of the economy was also expected to
result in substantial job opportunities to reduce the level of unemployment in
the country. In fact, the achievement of full employment by 1980 and the
simultaneous upgrading of job quality were the major goals for the 1971-1980
plan periods (in the 1975-1980 plan period, the manufacturing sector was
forecast to provide 47,000 new jobs). To achieve this diversification of the
economy Government has sought to develop policies and offer incentives which
would attract foreign investment. Given the small domestic market and lack of
local raw materials, the Government has tried to exploit the advantages of an
adaptable and generally competitively priced labor force, a sophisticated and
bilingual business community and preferential access to the markets of the
EEC. Consequently, Mauritius has offered an attractive package of investment
incentives to both foreign and local investors through the Development Credit
Scheme (para 1.11), the Export Processing Zone Scheme (para 1.11), tax bene-
fits, the provision of industrial estates (para. 1.10) and financial support
from the Mauritius banking sector. In this respect, the Development Bank of
Mauritius (DBM), a Government owned development bank, has sought to provide
both local and foreign term financial assistance to productive enterprises
along with the commercial banks. As noted in the Past Performance (para 1.02)
the policies of the Government have been generally successful in encouraging
industrial investment particularly in the early seventies. More recently,
however, there has been a decline in foreign industrial investment and con-
sequently Government has decided to provide greater assistance to the indi-
genous artisan/small scale sector as a means of creating additional job
opportunities and further reducing the level of imports for basic manufactured
goods.
1.02      Past Performance.  Until the early 1960s, sugar milling and its
ancillary industries were the only significant forms of industrial activity
in Mauritius. Beginning in 1963 the Government introduced measures which
encouraged the development of import substitution activites. By the late
sixties it was apparent that, due to the smallness of the domestic market
for locally produced goods, the opportunities for import replacement were
becoming more and more limited, and that other forms of industrial activity
were needed. Thus, since 1970 the focus of industrial development shifted
towards production of goods for export. Given the paucity of raw materials
in Mauritius both import substitution and export industries have had to rely
heavily on iIported inputs.

1.03      Despite such reliance the performance of the manufacturing sector in
the seventies has been good particularly in the period 1971 to 1975 when growth
in value added averaged (at constant prices) 17% p.a., employment 17% p.a. and
over 100% p.a. for the value of exports. By 1977, large establishments in the
manufacturing sector contributed 17% of total employment, and the sector
contributed 11% of GDP and 22% of exports (Annex 1). This impressive per-
formance may be attributed to the EPZ scheme (para. 1.11) which in the period
1972-1975 contributed 76% of new jobs in large manufacturing establishments.
The single most important factor has probably been the free access to the EEC
granted most industrial exports first under the Yaounde Convention, to which
Mauritius acceeded in 1972 and since 1975 under the Lome Convention. Mauritius
was in a better position to exploit the advantages of associate membership
than most other ACP countries given the relative development of its entre-
preneurial class, low wage level coupled with an easily trainab:le labor force
and little administrative red tape. Moreover, it was able to attract entre-
preneurs from many countries, including India, Pakistan and Hongkong with
which it has strong cultural ties and which were limited by quotas assigned
them by the EEC for some export products.
1.04      Beginning with 1976, however, there has been a marked slowdown in
the performance of the manufacturing sector. The slowdown has its origins in
a number of factors. From the domestic side, the sugar industry, whose
profits largely fuel domestic investment, was severely affected by cyclone
"Gervaise" in February 1975, droughts in successive years, delays in the
implementation of irrigation projects and a dramatic decline in the world
sugar price. Industrial activity was also directly affected by cyclone
"Gervaise", which caused damage to factory buildings and equipment and dis-
rupted utilities. Declining productivity and increasing labor costs (see
para 1.13) have affected profitability and a few projects have had to close-
down although other factors like poor project design, marketing and management
have been major contributory factors to such closures. k'rom the international
side, the generally depressed state of the economies of the developed count-
ries, has restricted growth in demand for export products from Mauritius and
also the interest of foreign industrial investors in Mauritius. Moreover,
Mauritius may be losing part of her competitive advantage vis-a-vis the EEC
due to other countries reaching similar agreements with the EEC, e.g., the
Maghreb countries which have the advantage of a greater raw materials base and
proximity to the EEC markets. In addition, more and more countries are
offering investment incentives similar to Mauritius.
1.05      Ownership and Structure of Industry.  The private sector has been
throughout, the vehicle for industrial development; state enterprises control
less than 2% of total industrial production. Enterprises producing primarily
for the domestic market are almost entirely Mauritian owned, but most export
oriented enterprises are majority privately foreign owned. While local
ownership in small establishments is relatively well dispersed, local owner-
ship in large establishments is for the most part concentrated in a few
powerful groups, which also have substantial interests in the sugar industry
or in trading activities. These groups remain the major contributor of
resources for and the primary impetus behind indigenous industrial development;
their activities are obviously largely influenced by the performance of the
sugar sector from which they derive a substantial part of their resources.

1.06      Large Scale Enterprises.  In 1977 large manufacturing establishments
(employing 10 or more workers) accounted for 80% of gross value added and 56%
of total employment in the manufacturing sector. Annex 2 provides information
by subsector on value added, employment and wages in large establishments.
Wearing apparel and textiles are the dominant subsectors both in terms of
employment and value added.
1.07      Artisan/Small-Scale Enterprises.  For statistical purposes small-
scale enterprises (SSEs) have been classified as those enterprises employing
less than 10 workers. At this size, most SSEs are essentially artisanal
units. Although accurate data is not available, it is estimated that there
are some 4,000 such SSEs, which employ about 20,000 persons and contribute
about 20% of production in the non-sugar manufacturing sector.
1.08      Artisans/SSEs in Mauritius can be divided into traditional or
"cottage" and modern small enterprises. The former, which are predominant,
are engaged in such activities as tailoring, garment-making, furniture-making,
shoemaking, metal work, jewelry, fishing, pig and poultry farming and printing
as well as service enterprises such as small garages, laundry and repair
shops. These SSEs typically are one-man owner/worker units assisted by a few
helpers or family members, cater almost exclusively to the domestic consumer
market, and are located mainly in the rural areas. Most of these SSEs suffer
from lack of modern management and technical skills and have virtually no
knowledge of accounting and cost control methods. Major constraints to their
development are lack of space for expansion, shortages of raw materials,
antiquated equipment and machinery, and restriction on access to credit from
the financial sector.
1.09      The second group in the artisan/small-scale sector are the modern
enterprises. Some of these have developed over the past 5-10 years from
former "cottage industries" in such businesses as shoemaking, baked goods,
mechanical workshops and plastics. Others have more recently surfaced in such
sectors as food processing, printing and furniture making. These enterprises
are able to benefit from the generous incentive schemes offered by the Govern-
ment for import substitution and export activities. The Development Bank of
Mauritius (DBM) has made significant progress in providing medium and long
term finance to these artisan/SSEs essentially in the urban areas (para. 3.05)
and limited working capital assistance is also available from commercial banks,
particularly the State Commercial Bank (SCB); however, there remains consider-
able scope for expansion of such financing particularly in the rural areas.
1.10      Industrial Estates.  Mauritius has developed two main industrial
estates in the Port Louis area with the requisite infrastructure, services and
buildings. The first industrial estate was at Plaine Lauzun and has been
fully occupied with 35 enterprises filling the six buildings. The second
larger development of the Coromandel Industrial Estate has not been equally
successful (para. 3.06). There have been problems in recent years with regard
to the quality of maintenance services pravided to the estates, transportation



- 4 -
of wor!zers to the estates and labor problems. However, establishment of these
industrikal estates has had an overall positive effect on investors.  Through
DBM, land has been bought for further industrial estates; however, current
development plans are tentative and dependant on growth in investment demand.
1.1i       Incentive Schemes.  The two main incentive schemes offered by
Government to attract industrial investment are as follows:
(a) The Development Certificate (DC) Scheme: The Development Certi-
ficate (DC) introduced in 1964 provides selected import sub-
stituting enterprises with a number of tax and duty exemptions.
About 180 companies have be;)efitted from the scheme! and at the
end of 1978, 122 were still operating, particularly in such
industries as food and beverages, textiles and garments, chemical
products and iron and steel. As of September 1977, suchI DC
enterprises employed 5,715 people.
(b)  The Export Processing Zone (EPZ) Scheme, introduced in 1971.
Enterprises setting up factories to sell their entiret olutput
outside Mauritius are granted a 10-20 years company tax holiday
on retained earnings, tax-free dividends in the first f[ve years
and exemption of duty for imports of machinery and equipment.
Other benefits offered include:  free repatriation of profits,
liberal work permits for specialist expatriate staff and export
financing at preferential rates. Until now, priority has been
given by Government to industries which are highly labor-
intensive or create substantial indirect employment oppor-
tunities and those which introduce new technology and marketing
know-how. Local participation of a minimum of 30%' of equity is
encouraged.  As of September 30, 1978 tne 91 EPZ companies in
operation employed some 18,000 people; textiles and garments
(48 firms), jewelry, electronics, diamond cutting watches, toys
and plastic goods are the major industries represented.
1.12       Cost-benefit analyses conducted by a World Bank m-ission and a
UNIDO adviser to the Mauritian Government on a sample of firms indicate that
on average both the DC and EPZ schemes have been of positive net benefit for
Mauritius. Employment creation, while substantial in the EP'Z companies, has
been limited among the generally more capital intensive DC companies.  Also,
because of sluggish domestic demand, a large number of DC f-irms are operating
at far less than full capacity.
Wages, Productivity and Employment
1.13       In recent years the Government has decrieed a number of significant
wage and salary increases often with little or no prior warning to the
industrial/commercial sector.  There has also been increased labor absenteeism
which is aggravated by the lack of a public transportation system adequate to
serve the widely dispersed work force. Also in recent years, some decline in
worker productivity is claimed to have occurred in part due to the immediate
financial needs of workers being met and also the further development of trade
union activities. The consequences have been a recent decline in manufacturing
sector productivity and delays by manufacturers considering new investments.



- 5 -
Despite these problems with the labor force, well managed companies have con-
tinued to operate profitably and consider that the labor force remains inter-
nationally competitive. However, a continued deterioration in productivity,
absenteeism etc. could materially affect this position and a concerted effort
by Government, management and labor is needed to improve labor-management
relations and hence productivity.
1.14      Registered unemployment 1/ as of November 1978 was 16,613 or 5% of
the estimated labor force. In the manufacturing sector, as in the rest of
the economy, unemployment and underemployment co-exist with a shortage of
labor, indicating that most unemployment is structural or frictional. As
their average level of education increases, Mauritians find it increasingly
less desirable to work as unskilled or semi-skilled workers. At the same
time lack of sufficient vocational training has created a shortage of skilled
workers and shop level management required by the more sophisticated indus-
tries. A further social problem is the imbalance between male and female
employment (46.2% for male and 53.8% for female of employment in large
manufacturing establishments against a national average of 76.0 and 24.0%
respectively of employment among all large establishments) and the ensuing
unemployment and underemployment among male skilled workers. This imbalance
is the result of the large proportions of female workers (80%) in the Export
Enterprises (para. 1.11) which account for 59% of employment in large estab-
lishments. This problem may be reduced with diversification of production in
these enterprises away from textiles, garments, and electronics, industries
which now predominate and have utilized cheaper female labor whose skills are
particularly suited to those required for these types of industries.
Development Issues
1.15      Many factors influential in past successes, namely apparently com-
petitive wages in industry and an easily trainable labor force, preferential
access to the EEC and a small economy unlikely to provoke demands for quota
restrictions in other countries, will continue to work in the favor of indus-
trial development in Mauritius. However, a number of constraints, originating
both at home and abroad, are likely to be encountered. Among the more serious
domestic factors are the labor problems (paras 1.13-1.14). In addition there
are several real physical constraints which are beginning to affect or could
affect in the future the manufacturing sector: (i) implementation of major
water projects and consequently the development of the water supply system for
industrial use is lagging; the Government, however, is considering measures to
facilitate the implementation of existing projects and in addition is preparing
new projects, including one targeted for Bank assistance; (ii) nearly all
sources of hydropower have been exploited and there are no other indigenous
resources (fossil fuel) for energy; consequently increasing reliance must be
placed on thermal development and the cost of electricity is high; (iii) the
road system is inadequate and development is lagging; (iv) the harbor is
congested (this should ease with the completion of the harbor development
program started during the previous plan period); (v) further development of
the construction sector is constrained by shortages of qualified manpower,
1/   Defined as persons aged 15 or over without work, yet seeking employment.



- 6 -
and periodic shortages of construction materials on the local market; the
Government plans to alleviate these constraints by establishing better training
facilities and ensuring the availability of construction materials. Among the
international factors, in the short term, sluggish growth among and reduced
demand from industrialized countries is likely to affect Mauritius exporting
performance and the level of foreign direct investment. Mauritius will also
continue to be more penalized than many other developing countries, by its
distance from major markets.
1.16      Recognising these problems, Government has taken two important
initiatives to try and assist the further development of the industrial sector
through programs of (a) industrial promotion abroad; and (b) technical assis-
tance to artisans/SSEs.
(a) Industrial Promotion. In March 1977 a UNDP financed advisor
was attached to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to launch
an Industrial Promotion Project for which the EEC approved a
grant of 700,000 UA. The project aims at stimulating indust-
rial investment through product and market diversification.
It includes financing for (i) three investment consultants in
Europe (France, Germany and Italy or the UK); (ii) two European
investment promotion tours for Mauritian industrialists; (iii)
a study of the possibilities of promoting Mauritius as a base
for the manufacture, marketing and distribution of essential
goods imported by ACP countries in the African and Indian Ocean
area; and (iv) a study on the potential for developing processing
industries based on the sugar industry. Promotional material has
been published for circulation to trade and industry associations
abroad and participation in special trade fairs is planned.
Implementation of the project is progressing somewhat slower
than anticipated, largely due to administrative delays.
(b) Technical Assistance to Artisans/SSEs. Government support to
SSEs has been modest until recently. A four man Small Scale
Industries Unit (SSIU) established in 1975 in the Ministry of
Commerce and Industry has been the main Government vehicle for
promoting the development of the artisan/small-scale sector
through provision of technical and management assistance.
Given the limited resources of this unit, its assistance has
been restricted in practice to printing literature on imported
equipment suitable for various industries, helping industries
obtain Government permits, and preparing feasibility studies
for financing from DBM. The unit works in collaboration with
50 Village Development Officers (VDO) of the Rural Development
Unit in the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development in
promoting and assisting rural industrialization; to date 500
enterprises have been visited. However, the VDOs lack the
technical expertise to provide SSEs with much of the assist-
ance they need. In early 1979, UNDP agreed to finance a
three year program of technical assistance to the artisan/
small scale enterprise sector in both urban and rural areas;
a technical assistance bureau will be based either in DBM or
in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, with UNIDO as the
executing agency.



1.17      The Government has also proposed an incentive package to help import
substituting enterprises, many of which are operating below capacity, to
commence exporting. Development Certificate Companies would be eligible for
the benefits offered after expiration of their certificates. Consideration is
also being given to the possibilities for promoting inter-alia, joint export
marketing activities, a Central Freight Bureau, a regional shipping line an
air freight operation in Mauritius and an export credit guarantee scheme.
Prospects
1.18      In the short term, manufacturing performance for large establish-
ments is unlikely to improve significantly. Prospects appear more optimistic
for the medium and long term, as larger firms which have applied for EPZ
certificates start operations, I/ and the industrial promotion program begin
to produce results as the economic climate abroad improves. In addition, the
artisan/small scale sector, given its low capital/labor ratio, has significant
potential to contribute in the near term to employment creation; in particular
the more traditional SSEs may contribute to import substitution for basic
goods catering to the lower income urban and rural markets. The more modern
enterprises in furniture and garments, have some potential of contributing to
improving the foreign exchange situation through exports. There is also scope
for small enterprises to develop as ancillary activities to the modern sector
in such industries as toys, wooden products, footwear, electrical appliances
and sporting goods once the quality of the products and services supplied,
attain standards acceptable to the larger industries. The industrial sector
development will also be influenced by the initiatives taken by Government,
with regard to investment in public infrastructure to remove physical con-
straints, labor relations and industrial promotion.
B.   The Sugar Sector
1.19      Employing about 30% of the country's labor force, accounting for 85%
of exports and contributing to about 45% of GDP, the sugar sector and its by-
products is, by far, the most important in Mauritius. The dramatic fluctua-
tions in sugar prices (from US$516.7/ton in 1975 to US$368.8/ton in 1978)
has had a tremendous adverse impact on the economy. In addition, the sector
is being seriously affected by a low and declining productivity, a shortage of
cane cutters/loaders, a high absenteeism and by the inability to attract a
younger labor force to replace an aging one.
1.20      The sugar estate operators (21 private sugar mills, of which three
foreign, and one owned by the State) and, to a certain degree, the Government
itself claim that the decrease in the number of cane cutters/loaders has
today reached proportions so acute that seasonal employment may no longer be
1/   It is estimated that there is between two and three years between
application for a certificate and start of production, that certificates
are issued for about 75% of applications approved every year and that
about 90% of companies which are granted certificates actually start
production.



- 8 -
the balancing item to solve labor shortages. This has had a direct impact on
the timing of the harvesting season, the crop yields and as a result, on the
overall sugar production of the country. In addition, the objective of the
Government is to produce 800,000 tons (650,000 tons were produced in 1978
according to preliminary estimates) without increasing the surface planted.
This, together with the fact that at present mechanical harvesting and loading
represent rather low percentages over total harvests/loads, is gLving addi-
tional and increasing weight to the arguments in favor of the gradual mechani-
zation of the sector.
1.21      The sugar estates, which belong to financially sound and profitable
corporations in Mauritius have prepared mechanization programs which require
considerable financial assistance. Most of the sugar corporations have
decided, as a first step, to go for only limited mechanized harvesting and
fully mechanized loading, because of the substantially higher investment and
operating costs involved in fully mechanized harvesting. DBM identified 14 out
of the 21 sugar estates as being potentially interested in obtaining financing
for mechanization programs, and after review has ended up actively considering
financing projects for the mechanization of seven sugar estates, with total
capital requirements of close to Rs 40 million and loans application to DBM
representing about Rs 23 million. It is clear however that potential demand
for financing mechanization programs throughout the country is considerably
higher than this -- probably betwen Rs 50-75 million term credit needs per
annum over the next two years.
1.22      As agreed with IBRD under Loan 1481-MAS, DBM has prepared a study
on the overall rationale for mechanization in the sugar sector. The study
points out the drift of labor from the sugar estates to the urban areas,
particularly the younger members of the labor force. The result has been that
the permanent labor force on the sugar estates is insufficient to handle a
rapid harvest and consequently temporary additional labor has to be hired for
the harvest. The Development Works Corporation has provided such temporary
labor but it is becoming increasingly difficult to hire staff even on a
temporary basis to undertake the physically arduous work of cutting and
loading sugarcane. Thus there is an established need for mechanized cutting
and loading equipment to offset labor shortages during the harvest. Government
has approved DBM's recommendations and considers the mechanization program
will not adversely affect the labor employment situation in the country.
Consequently DBM has started committing the US$2.5 million specifically
allocated for the sugar sector under the last IBRD Loan 1481-MAS. Under
the proposed fifth line of credit further IBRD funds would also be available
for sugar sector financing. However, DBM has agreed to periodically consult
with IBRD on the extent of its investments in the sugar sector so as to
prevent an overpreponderance of financing such investments to the detriment
of viable investments in other sectors.
C.   The Tourism Sector
1.23      Tourist arrivals in Mauritius grew rapidly from 68,000 in 1973 to
103,000 in 1977, with foreign exchange receipts increasing from Rs 83 million
to Rs 210 million. Seasonality is rather pronounced with a peak of arrivals
in the November-January season.



- 9 -
1.24      At the end of 1977 there were 37 hotels in the island offering
accommodation for a total of 1,880 rooms and 3,700 beds. No reliable data
exist on occupancy rates but they are estimated to have been below 50% on
the average in 1977 and, as a result, most hotels have been making losses.
Tourism development has not been a Government priority until 1977, although
tourism investments have been receiving the same advantages as industrial
investments under the existing investment code.
1.25      In 1978, however, partly as a result of the poor overall economic
situation, and partly due to the Government's awareness of tourism as a
potential generator of the foreign exchange receipts badly needed by the
country, more attention has been given to the sector. Accordingly the promo-
tional budget of the Tourism Office was increased sixfold and promotional
campaigns in the main European markets were initiated. Preliminary figures
show an increase of more than 10% in the number of tourism arrivals in 1978
over 1977 and reportedly the increase in hotel occupancy rates have permitted
a substantial number of hotels to become profitable. Government's present and
forecast promotional efforts are expected rather optimistically to justify the
existence of 9,000 beds in 1990 (i.e., a 140% increase over 1977). However,
new hotels will not be needed until 1981-1982. Tourism is beginning to be
recognized as a priority sector, and accordingly, detailed policies (pricing,
marketing, control, etc.) to prompt its rational development are being thought
out. The results achieved by the sector in 1979 and 1980 will be important to
realistically ascertain if the increase in 1978 continues, and thus, if the
potential corresponds to present expectations.
D.   The Financial Sector
1.26      Despite its relatively small size, Mauritius has a wide range
of financial intermediaries. The banking system consists of the Bank of
Mauritius (Central Bank), commercial banks, the Cooperative Central Bank,
the Post Office Savings Bank and the Development Bank of Mauritius. There
are also a number of insurance companies, a housing corporation, investment
trusts, pension funds and the Sugar Insurance Fund which charges premia on
all sugar production and pays benefits in years of poor harvests.
1.27      Commercial bank credit in Mauritius grew at a pace of 17% in 1975,
28% in 1976 and 43% in 1977. In 1978, the Central Bank required credit
expansion to be restricted through a number of measures including sectoral
credit ceilings, increased reserve ratios, etc. and expansion was brought down
to about 6% without disrupting export earning sectors. At the end of 1978,
foreign exchange reserves were only about Rs 250 million (two-month imports)
and to ensure against their depletion, the Central Bank was proposing for 1979
a similar monetary policy to 1978, with the following changes for commercial
banks:
(i) overall credit ceilings are abolished;
(ii) trade sector credit would be limited to the average
level in 1976 and credit extended by foreign exporters
to Mauritian importers would be controlled;



- 10 -
(iii)  the reserve ratio was raised from 25% to 30%;
(iv)  deposit rates were increased by up to 1% and onlending
rates increased for non-priority sectors (see Annex 3
for the structure of interest rates).
1.28      Whilst credit only grew by 6% in 1978, liquidity levels of the
commercial banks averaged about 30% whic!-P was 5% above the Governiment minimum
-- thus indicating that in the 1978 econcmic climate in Mauritius there was
little scope for credit growth for bankers.  Although the reserve ratio has
now been raised to 30%, the commercial banking sector should have adequate
liquidity to meet demand in 1979/80 given the mediocre economic activity
forecast.
1.29      The interest rate structure in Mauritius, having not moved from 1974
to March 1977, has undergone a number of increases in recent years with the
latest in September 1979 raising the commercial banks prime rate to 10.25%
(Annex 3). Commercial bank deposit rates have also been increased from 6 3/4%
to 7-3/4% for 3 months deposits and from 7-1/2 to 8-1/2% for one year deposits
in order to attract further deposits in an economy with a relatively sophis-
ticated deposits/savings system. This system has been an effective means of
mobilizing local resources in Mauritius. The result has been that in recent
years, the industrial sector has been provided with adequate short term local
currency resources to cover working capital needs. However, inevitably in
the current climate, the commercial banks are paying closer attention to the
financial condition of their industrial clients when agreeing such facilities.
1.30      The interbank market, a past source of short-term funds for DBM,
is no longer operative given the present structure of interest rates. As a
result DBM at various times experienced some day to day cash flow problems.
These were eased by short term credit facilities from the Central Bank, and/or
Government loans and DBM's liquidity situation is now satisfactorv.
1.31      The inflation rate in Mauritius rose in 1978 to about 10% and is
expected to increase in the 1979/81 period to about 12%. DBM maintains a
continuous review of its interest rates in relation to inflation and general
economic conditions, DBM profitability and the prevailing interest rate
structure in Mauritius and will continue to initiate adjustments to its
relending rates, as appropriate (para. 3.14).
II. THE INSTITUTION
2.01      Background and Objectives.  The Development Bank of Mauritius
(DBM) was established in 1964 to succeed the Mauritius Agricultural Bank
(MAB) whose assets and liabilities it assumed. As defined in its State-
ment of General Policy, the institution's broad objectives are to provide
equity and term financing as well as management and technical assistance for
productive investment facilitating the industrial, agricultural and economic
development of the country. DBM has received two IDA credits and 2 IBRD loans



- 11 -
totalling US$23.5 million for financing medium and large scale industry and
tourism investment plus an IDA credit to finance an industrial estate. The
last IBRD loan, approved June 1977, included US$5 million for standard indus-
trial/tourism financing and US$2.5 million for mechanization/modernization of
the Sugar Sector.
2.02      Ownership and Board.  DBM is a public institution owned by the
Government (75.0%), the Bank of Mauritius (20.0%) and the State Insurance
Corporation of Mauritius (5.0%). 1/ Its Board of twelve directors includes
representatives of the Government (4), the private sector (4), the University
of Mauritius (2), one from the Bank of Mauritius (1) plus the Managing
Director. The Board is generally experienced and capable, offers a broad mix
of investment interests and has taken an active involvement in the operations
of DBM.
2.03      Management.  The present Managing Director, an expatriate on second-
ment from the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), assumed his duties
on a three-year contract in May 1978. The Mauritian staff has reached a level
of proficiency such that the successor could well be a Mauritian national.
The present Managing Director has shown initiative in ideas for strengthening
DBM, particularly its supervision activities following the period of dynamic
growth of the institution under his predecessor, an expatriate from the World
Bank. He is being assisted by an assistant Managing Director who is a
Mauritian national. DBM's management team is capable and competent.
2.04      Organization and Staffing.  The institution is organized into four
operational lending divisions and an Administrative Division which includes a
Deeds and Accounts Section. The Lending Divisions are the Industrial Estate
Division, the Industrial (including Tourism) Division, the Agricultural
Division and the Small Enterprise Division.
2.05      As of December 1978, DBM had a staff of 77, including 27 profes-
sionals and 50 support staff. Five professionals each were in the Industrial
Estate, Industrial and Agricultural Divisions, nine in the Administrative
Division, and one in the Small Enterprise Division which also has 13 field
officers serving as regional representatives including one posted on the
island of Rodrigues. The professional staff which was adequate in number had
increased by one since the last appraisal with the appointment in 1977 of an
ODM sponsored Development Advisor to the Industrial Estate Division. As part
of its efforts to strengthen procurement and supervision activities DBM is
considering hiring a much-needed professional with technical and economic
expertise.
2.06      With the exception noted above the staff is adequate in number
and experience to deal with the present workload. Since the last appraisal,
significant progress has been made in the accounting, legal and small-scale
1/   DBM's authorized share capital was increased from Rs 31.4 million to
Rs 50.0 million by amendment to its Act on June 12, 1979. Previous to
this increase it was owned by the Government (93.6%) and the Bank of
Mauritius (6.4%).



- 12 -
industry operations, and the staff is generally quite competent. DBM
regularly sends professional staff for training abroad, including at EDI.
Other staff members are encouraged to pursue their studies at home, parti-
cularly in law, accounting, banking and secretarial studies. DBM's overall
staffing and training program is well conceived and efficientLy implemented.
Procedures
2.07      Project Appraisal.  Project appraisal is performed individually by
the investment officer or field officer (small-scale enterprises). All
projects are then reviewed first by the Assistant Managing Director and
subsequently by the Managing Director, after which loans above Rs 10,000 are
submitted to the Board for approval. The quality of appraisal. work generally
is good. DBM is having a greater impact on the design of projects it finances
through involvement in earlier stages of project preparation.
2.08      Project Supervision.  Project supervision in the past has concent-
rated too heavily on projects with payments in arrears and not enough atten-
tion has been devoted to regular monitoring of the operational performance of
all active projects. Until late 1978, appraisal and supervision responsibi-
lities were combined within the lending division, and investment officers
tended to put more emphasis on appraisal to the detriment of implementation
and follow-up, particularly during the expansion period DBM enjoyed until
1978. Until now the frequency of visits to clients has essentially been
left at the discretion of the individual officer, depending on the situation
of the borrower, with a minimum of one visit per year. In 1978 the problems
experienced by a few companies in the portfolio were so severe and staff time
consuming that even the annual visit was not made in a number of cases. DBM's
borrowers are legally obliged to send DBM a set of full financial statements
at least once a year, but in practice annual reports are not regularly received
from companies in which DBM has no equity investment. However, on a small
island like Mauritius, there is always some knowledge of clients maintained
through informal communications. Supervision of small-scale clients is per-
formed informally by the regional representatives and has generally been
adequate.
2.09      Recognizing its shortcomings in this area, DBM has started stream-
lining and standardizing its supervision activities. A Reconstruction/Follow-
up Department is being established within the Industrial Division. Two
investment officers have already been appointed to form the nucleus of this
cell and DBM intends to hire an experienced techno/economic professional
(para. 2.05) to assist in project supervision and recovery, as well as pro-
curement. The new system will include: (i) periodic supervision visits
and reports; (ii) for major problem projects, establishment of a Management
Committee with the Commercial Banks to supervise and monitor the implementa-
tion by client management of reconstruction schemes. (The Government is
considering new legislation to enable such a Committee to manage the enter-
prises concerned.)
2.10      Accounts and Audits.  Internal accounting procedures are efficient.
The Accounting Division works closely with DBM's auditors, Kemp Chatteris
(associated with Touche Ross and Co.). DBM's auditors are competent and their
recent audit reports for DBM were well prepared.



- 13 -
2.11      Legal.  DBM retains a part-time legal advisor and employs a senior
deeds officer. Processing of legal documents is smooth wit'i a minimum of
formalities.
2.12      Procurement.  For medium- and large-scalc loans DBM has tradi-
tionally requested clients directly to seek alternative quotations for both
equipment and construction contracts. However, a new polic-y has now been
initiated whereby, for loans over Rs 1 million, investment officers indepen-
dently will seek as appropriate to verify quotitions and the adequacy of
performance guarantees from the supplier. n .uIans to hire a techno/economic
person (para 2.05) to inter alia supervise procurement activities. For
small-scale loans procurement is generally done locally under control of DBM
which monitors procurement to prevent ent--evieneurs from being overcharged by
local dealers and suppliers of equipment.
2.13      Disbursement.  Disbursement procedures are satisfactory.  DBM
disburses normally through letters of credit (for import financing) or after
receiving evidence of completion of work on construction contracts. k'or
small-scale loans, disbursement procedures are simplified and are controlled
by the field officer.
III. OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
3.01      Volume of Overall Operations.  Annex 4 shows the evolution of DBM's
operations. DBM has financed medium and large scale enterprises, artisan/small
scale enterprises in the industrial, agribusiness, tourism and agricultural
sectors as well as industrial estates. Historically, on average 80% of DBM's
loan approvals in volume relate to loans and equity investments for medium
and large scale enterprises (MLEs) in the industry and tourism sector. In
FiY 1979, however, MLEs accounted for only 42% with approval for sugar estate
mechanization projects representing for the first time an important 26%. By
number loans to artisan/SSEs have represented more than 90% of DBM's approvals.
Between FY 1972 and FY 1977 DBM enjoyed a steady phase of overall expansion
due to the industrial boom. Since then performance has deteriorated. Loan
approvals declined by 6% from Rs 85 million to Rs 80 million in FY 1978 and
by a further 40% in FY 1979 to Rs 48 million. These declines reflect the
depressed climate for industrial investment, particularly from abroad. Com-
mitments and disbursements followed an identical pattern after the usual delay.
3.02      Medium and Large Scale Industry and Tourism Enterprises.  Loan
amounts approved in FY1978 and FY1979 ranged from Rs 55,000 for the expansion
of a mechanical workshop to Rs 12 million for a new brewery plant. DBM's
approvals still show a continuing high concentration in the textile export
sector (35% of loans outstanling b-; mid-1979) followed by hotels (15%), food
processing (6.0%) and fisbiin- and fish processing (2.2%). The risk to DBM due
to its high exposure in tefniies is mitigated by the diversity of products
produced in Mauritius (jute oars, yarn, made-up garments, knitwear), by the
geographical dispersion of markers and by Mauritius' small size which makes
it less of a target for quotas fiom importing countries. A number of textile
firms have been experiencing problems recently (para. 3.11), but most of them
have the potential to operate viably if restructured properly.



- 14 -
3.03      Artisan/Small-Scale Financing.  At the request of the Government,
DBM in 1971 took over and developed successfully a financing scheme for
small-scale entrepreneurs previously managed by the Small-Scale Industries
Branch (transformed into SSIU) in the Ministry of Education. DBM defines on
SSE to be an enterprise whose employment numbers 25 or less and which has
fixed assets of not more than Rs 300,000, excluding land. However, the vast
majority of DBM's clients in this sector are owner/manager units assisted by a
few family members or employees. DBM's loans normally cover about 80% of the
fixed capital cost and usually have 5-7 years maturity. All loans to artisans
are guaranteed by the Government, which also reimburses DBM for legal and
administrative expenses incurred in operating the program (in FY 1978 this
amounted to Rs 781,000). Government funds provided for the program have been
channelled to DBM normally at DBM's prevailing onlending rate. The State
Commercial Bank provides working capital to projects financed by DBM out of
the scheme.
3.04      The program owes much of its success to the group of 13 highly
enthusiastic and capable field officers who are attached to the Small-Scale
Division and operate out of nine offices within local communities. All
officers are high school graduates; to date six have been sent: by DBM for 4-8
week SSI training courses in Ireland and it is expected that more will go in
the future. As is appropriate for the type of projects financed, project
appraisal is relatively simple and the average time between applications and
finalization of appraisals is only one week. Implementation and supervision
are the responsibility of field officers, who usually do not provide technical
assistance.
3.05      The yearly volume of loans to artisans/SSEs increased rapidly (Annex
5) in the first years of the scheme and total investments amounted to Rs 15.6
million for 2072 loans by mid-1979; however, in FY 1978 and FY 1979 only 274
and 189 loans respectively were approved (as against an average of about 390
during 1975-77).  This decline is due to market saturation of some subsectors
in the Port Louis area, as well as the general economic situation and the
limited promotion given the program recently. This situation should improve
once the proposed UNDP technical assistance program is set up (see para 1.16),
and if a proposal to set up mini-industrial estates in the rural areas is
accepted and developed. This proposal has been preappraised by a consultant
as part of a 2nd IBRD Rural Development Project under preparation. The
average loan size increased from Rs 7,000 in FY 1977 to Rs 10,000 in FY 1978
but declined to Rs 9000 in FY 1979. The average size is expected to increase
in the future as the potential for new shops diminishes and more existing
establishments expand and return for a second loan. The major subsectors
assisted are furniture, garments, light engineering, leather works and mixed
farming. The average cost per job is estimated at about Rs 6,000 for the
informal sector and Rs 15,000 for small scale enterprises, as compared to
Rs 75,000 for DBM's large scale clients. The repayment record on the artisan/
small-scale sector has been very good (para. 3.12) and to date no loan has
been written off.
3.06      Industrial Estates.  The recent level of operations in industrial
estates has been low, following the completion of the second industrial estate
(Coromandel) in late 1977/early 1978.  This industrial estate is only partially
leased as compared to the first industrial estate at Plaine Lauzun whose six



- 15 -
buildings have been filled by 35 companies. As of December 1978, 53% of the
632,629 sq.ft. of Coromandel's buildings area and 46% of the 25 acres of
plots of land in the estate had been leased. Thirty enterprises had taken
building leases - overwhelmingly on the ground floor - and three more had
leased plots of land; textiles (nine leases) and mechanical industries (five)
are the most widespread productive activities but close to 40% of the total
leases agreed are for warehousing for various industrial and service activities
which are non-productive and generally only short term leases. Duration of the
building leases oscillate between 6 months and three years, while plots of
land are leased for 20 years. The average building surface leased is 10,630
sq. ft. per enterprise and overwhelmingly are at rates involving no subsidies.
Partial indications show that more than 1,500 jobs, have been created by the
operating companies installed in the Coromandel estate so far.
3.07      Although the major attraction of Coromandel is its immediate avail-
ability, the occupancy levels achieved so far are well below expectations.
The major constraints that have negatively affected Coromandel's development
can basically be grouped in two areas. The first one is the lack of addi-
tional ground floor space accompanied by a general reluctance on the part of
prospective lessees to accept first or second floor accommodations. Indeed, a
shift seems to have taken place in the composition of the type of industries
which are considered potential clients:  from foreign promoters of light
industries to local investors in activities which are not necessarily light.
The other major inhibiting factor is the difficulty in attracting qualified
labor for some of the industries - and in physically bringing them to the
estate - as a result, primarily, of the inadequate and costly public transport
facilities combined with the lack of housing in the immediate vicinity and of
adequate suporting services (such as banks, shops and restaurants) in the
area. The development of a housing area in the adjacent La Tour Koenig area
under planning for the 1980's would alleviate this situation in the future.
Maintenance of the industrial estate has been a problem. DBM is making
efforts to ameliorate the situation. In light of all this, DBM is reviewing
its previous forecast of full occupancy of Coromandel by mid-1980 and expects
it now to take place in 1981. DBM is currently preparing a Project Completion
Report for Credit 411-MAS: Coromandel, which will provide a comprehensive
evaluation of DBM's experience with the estate.
3.08      Agriculture. 1/  Traditionally DBM's agricultural loans have been
for small sugar planters, tea, mixed farming and livestock projects; between
FY 1974 and FY 1977 amounts approved ranged from Rs 1 million per annum to
Rs 3 million per annum accounting for 3.7 to 4.2% of total non-industrial
estate approvals. Average loan size in the period was about Rs 28,000. In
FY 1978 DBM made two large sugar loans of about Rs 5 million each and total
amounts approved by the agricultural division accounted for 14% of total loan
approvals. Approvals in FY 1979 amounted to Rs 3.4 million or 7% of total
loan approvals.
3.09      Transport.  In FY 1977 DBM contracted a line of credit from the
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) for the purpose of refinancing
loans made by the State Commercial Bank (SCB) for transport projects. As of
June 30, 1979, 11 loans had been approved under this program for a total of
Rs 15.6 million; Rs 22.9 million out of the line of credit are available for
new approvals.

Portfolio Evaluation
Loan Portfolio
3.10      As of June 30, 1979 DBM's total outstanding loan portfolio amounted
to Rs 218.9 million (US$35.7 million equivalent); medium/large-scale industry,
tourism and transport accounted for 90%, agricultural for 7% and small-scale
industry for 3%.
3.11      Medium and Large-Scale Industry and Tourism.  The quality of DBM's
industrial portfolio has deteriorated since the last appraisal in 1977. As of
June 30, 1979, 34% of the industrial and tourism loan portfolio was affected
by arrears of over 3 months; however, in absolute terms arrears over three
months amounted to only Rs 12.6 million or 6% of the portfolio. Eleven
projects are the major contributors to the arrears; a few have ceased oper-
ations, the others are experiencing serious difficulties. The major causes
include poor management, marketing problems, labor difficulties and parti-
cularly for EPZ textile firms (there are seven with arrears over three months)
losses in overseas markets. Most have the potential for operating profitably
if restructured. DBM is actively working to resolve the problems and recovery
proposals have been worked out for five companies while six remain to be
resolved (one, a textile firm, is expected to be written off).
3.12      Small-Scale Industry and Agriculture.  DBM is at risk only on its
medium- and large-scale industry, tourism and agriculture loans and small-scale
industry loans above Rs 25,000; the Government has guaranteed all loans to tea
planters and to artisans. The agricultural portfolio is small (Rs 16.3
million as of June 30, 1979) as the Agricultural Cooperative Bank has been the
major financier of this sector in recent years. The quality of the small-scale
industry portfolio (Rs 7.2 million) is good reflecting the responsible approach
to loan repayments by the small borrowers as well as the vigilance with which
defaulting clients are pursued. As of June 30, 1979 only 21% of small-scale
industry portfolio (including loans of more than Rs 25,000) wais affected by
arrears over 3 months which amounted to Rs 418,000 or 5.8% of the portfolio.
3.13      Equity Investments.  As of June 30, 1979, DBM had equity investments
totalling Rs. 16.0 million in 18 companies of which thirteen are owned by
private domestic investors, four are foreign-owned, and one is a Government-
owned commercial bank. DBM's participation averages 17% of the capital and
ranges from 1 to 42%. In FY 1979 the overall return on DBM's equity portfolio
was 10.1%. Of the 18 enterprises in which DBM has a share, 1]. are profitable,
six of them distribute dividends, and 7 were operating at a loss. DBM has
made adequate provisions to cover itself from possible losses on its equity
portfolio. Invested amounts in companies operating unprofitably amounts to
Rs 5.4 million. Five of the eighteen companies have an e!stimated value below
par. David Whitehead, a textile mill operated by the Lonhro Group, has been
closed down since December 1977 and DBM expects to write off its investment
of Rs 1.3 million, once assets are sold, at an as yet undetermined loss.
Provisions are adequate to cover this loss.



Interest Rates
3.14      DBM relends its term foreign exchange resources from IBRD at 12%
interest rate plus 1% commitment fee to medium- and large-scale sub-borrowers
who carry the exchange risk between the rupee and the US dollar with the
Government carrying the risk between the US dollar and currency of disburse-
ment; the cost of such funds to sub-borrowers implies a significantly positive
relending rate in real terms. DBM relends term local currency resources to
medium- and large-scale borrowers at the same rates; with inflation rates in
Mauritius of about 10% in 1978 and expected to average 12% in 1979/81, the
above local currency rates would be marginally positive in real terms.
3.15      Artisanal and small scale clients borrowing in local currency up to
Rs 25,000 1/ (US$4,000) pay 9.0% and for amounts greater than that, 12% plus
1% commitment fee; the lower rate is clearly concessionary. However, it
should be recognised that DBM's clients borowing money at 9.0% are essentially
artisans who have had little or no experience with the banking sector; the
interest rate is therefore an inducement to develop contact with the banking
sector and at the same time generate employment in the smallest enterprises.
Increasingly DBM clients who have received these subsidised funds, are return-
ing to DBM for further loans on which they must pay 12%. By number, 9% of its
FY 1979 approvals were at the higher rate and DBM expects this percentage to
rapidly increase in future years as more of these artisan clients seek second
loans at the higher interest rate.
3.16      There has been considerable evolution in Government's position on
interest rates to the artisan/SSE sector since the last appraisal mission in
1977; the increases from 2.5% to 9.0% for amounts up to Rs 25,000 and from 10%
to 12.0% for amounts above Rs 25,000 represent significant positive develop-
ments in Government's policies to the artisan/SSE sector. DBM recently in-
creased the rate to 9.0% from 6.5%. This rate is acceptable given that IBRD
has agreed that the artisan/SSE may benefit from some element of subsidy in a
concessional interest rate or from some cross subsidization. At negotiations,
DBM agreed to an objective of seeking to achieve real positive rates in the
future for loans of up to Rs 25,000.
3.17      Profitability.  Annexes 6 and 7 provide summarized financial state-
ments and ratios for recent years. Profit before provisions which increased
dramatically in FY 1976 and 1977 to Rs 5.8 million grew very little in FY
1978, rising to only Rs 6.1 million; however, in FY 1979 profit increased by
30% to Rs 7.9 million. The growth in profitability through FY 1977 may be
attributed to the rapid expansion in DBM's loan portfolio (233% between FY
1974 and FY 1977) and an increase in the spread from 2.4% in FY 1974 to a
peak of 4.0% in FY 1976. In addition DBM was able to contain administrative
expenses, which declined from 1.4% in FY 1974 to 0.7% in FY 1978 as a percent-
age of average total assets. The stagnation of profits in FY 1978 reflects
the decline in FY 1977 of disbursements for loans bearing higher interest
rates and a reduction in the spread to 3.0% in FY 1978 as DBM increased its
reliance on foreign borrowings at higher interest rates. The improved FY 1979
performance in profit before provisions is largely attributed to an increase
1/   Until mid-1979 Rs. 15,000



- 18 -
in the spread to 3.6%; due to a massive increase in provisions, however, net
profit, which had declined from 11.2% to 9.9% in FY 1978, declined further
to 6.6% in FY 1979.
3.18      Financial Situation.  DBM's increased operations have been mainly
financed through greater borrowings from both abroad and the Government.
These borrowings have been complemented by further Government equity contribu-
tions (Rs 4.0 million in FY 1977, Rs 3.9 million in FY 1978), and net cash
generation.  DBM's financial structure remains satisfactory.  The long-term
debt 1/ to year-end equity has risen from 1.7:1 in FY 1976 to 3.3:1 in FY 1979
when a portion of Government subordinated loans is treated as equity; this is
still well below the limit of 4:1 specified in the last Loan Agreement with
the Bank. When all Government subordinated loans are treated as debt, the
term debt/equity ratio (net of sinking fund) has risen from 3.2:1 in FY 1976
to 4.4:1 in FY 1979. Provisions are adequate at 3.7% of the net loan and
equity portfolio. While DBM experienced some short-term liquidity problems
after the collapse of the interbank money market, in FY 1979 the liquidity
position was satisfactory. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Government would insure that DBM has adequate local currency flnds to carry
out its forecast operations in the future. As can be seen from the above,
DBM remains a sound and creditworthy institution.
Economic Role and Performance
Audit Report
3.19      In June 1978, an audit report dated June 20, 1978 was completed on
the first IDA credit 313-MAS to DBM. The conclusions of the report were:
(i)  DBM had grown into an effective financial intermediary with a
high standard of project appraisal. The recommendation for
further improvements in supervision procedures is being imple-
mented (para. 2.09) as is the recommendation to expand tech-
nical assistance to the small scale sector (para. 1.16).
(ii)  DBM through financing industrial units outside the sugar
sector, had succeeded in helping diversify the economy
and export base of Mauritius: DBM continues to do so.
(iii)  DBM had been successful in generating new employment
opportunities - however, due to the type of export
industries financed i.e., textiles and garments, women
were employed rather than men and hence DBM was only
partially helping to offset the greater problem of
male unemployment. Proposed investment by DBM in the
SSE sector which is predominantly male owned and operated,
will help to alleviate male unemployment.

Economic Impact of Operations
3.20      Medium/Large-Scale Industry and Tourism.  Annex 8 assesses the
economic contribution of loans approved in FY 1977 and FY 1978. As a major
source of finance for projects in a wide variety of sectors, DBM has played
an important role in the diversification of the Mauritian economy away from
sugar, and has substantially contributed to improving the country's foreign
exchange position through financing import substitution and export oriented
projects. Cumulative estimated annual foreign exchange savings/earnings of
projects approved amounted to Rs 87.4 million in FY 1977. Projects approved
in these two years created 3,524 jobs at an average cost/job of about Rs
75,000 (US$12,000).
3.21      Small-Scale Industries and Agriculture.  No overall data has been
collected for employment generation among small-scale industries; however, it
is estimated that the projects financed through FY 1978 have created some
14,000 jobs. The small-scale financing scheme has the potential to contribute
to the country's foreign exchange position by supporting import substitution
projects and projects in the modern sector with export potential. Agriculture
operations have primarily been directed towards small farmers, although
recently DBM started financing mechanization/modernization needs of the sugar
sector, which is being affected by shortage of labor.
3.22      Resource Mobilization.  Since the last appraisal, DBM has further
diversified its sources of foreign borrowings. In May 1977 it contracted a
line of credit for the equivalent of approximately Rs 38.5 million from the
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) with a 10-year maturity; this loan
is being used to refinance SCB's loans to the transport sector. DBM earns a
spread of 0.6% under this scheme. In July 1977, DBM contracted a line of
credit of the equivalent of approximately Rs 22.5 million from the European
Investment Bank (EIB) at an interest rate of 5.875% with a matrity of 12
years. In addition, since June 1977 it has contracted two lines of credit
from the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique. As regards foreign exchange
risk, the subborrower now carries the risk between the rupee and the US dollar
and Government carries the risk from the US dollar to the currency of disburse-
ment. DBM never carries the foreign exchange risk. Despite the availability
of alternative sources of foreign exchange, DBM prefers to maintain the Bank
as its main source of foreign exchange in particular because of the technical
assistance offered by the Bank and the close working relationships in recent
years.

3.23      The Institution's Performance Under Previous Loans.  The table below
summarized DBM's operations under the previous three Bank loans.
979 MAS 1/      1168-MAS      1481-MAS 2/
No. of Projects                         15              14            21
Capital Cost (Rs million)             208              274           176

Cost per Job ($)                   14,300          18,150        28,178
The greater cost per job under the last IBRD loan reflects the increase in
expansions with limited employment creation among those projects financed in
recent years. In FY 1978, of 34 industrial projects financed by DBM only 8
were new as compared to 79 out of 90 financed in the period July 1, 1974 to
November 30, 1977.
Prospects
Forecast Operations
3.24      Given the depressed economic environment DBM operates in, DBM's
forecast operations represent a sensible reduction in real terms of its volume
of lending as compared to its high growth performance of the pre-1978 years.
DBM's pipeline of projects at mid 1979 consisted of 11 industrial tourism, and
sugar mechanization projects requiring about Rs 21 million of financial
assistance from DBM. This pipeline however does not include the possible
involvement of DBM in refinancing commercial banks' lending expected to be
mainly in the sugar sector. Except for two projects, the projects in the
pipeline are relatively small with total amounts required from DBM below Rs 3
million (US$500,000). Two projects requiring about Rs 7.2 mi:Llion direct
financing from DBM are in the sugar sector and more than half of the remaining
projects are for agro-industrial projects. In addition, there are four
projects in cabinet making, textile, sand quarry and pipe and machine tools.
3.25      The above pipeline is weak and this is reflected in DBM's projections.
DBM's forecast of operations, shown in Annex 9 shows a 35% increase in appro-
vals in current terms of medium/large scale (MLEs) industrial and tourism
operations from Rs 20 million in FY 1979 to Rs 27 million in FY 1980; this
increase is not significant when considered against the very depressed level
of operations in FY 1979. Approvals for MLEs are expected to stagnate at Rs
27.5 million in FY 1981 and afterwards slowly increase to Rs 50 million in FY
1984. In addition, sugar mechanization financing projects - totalling Rs 27
million - are expected in FY 80-84, and transport loans approvals - for Rs 19
million - should be spread in the three year period FY 80-82. Approvals for

- 21 -
SSE 1/ are projected to increase from the low of Rs 1.7 million in FY 1979
to Rs. 3.0 million by FY 1981, at which level they would thereafter remain.
Agricultural loans are expected to total Rs. 2 to 3 million per year while
industrial estate approvals would increase gradually from Rs 1.2 million in
EY 1979 to Rs 9 million in FY 1984. Equity investments of Rs 2-3 million per
annum are expected through FY 1984. Overall, DBM's approvals would increase
in current terms by about 5% in FY 1981 and 11% per annum thereafter, i.e.
from Rs 49 million in JY 1979 to Rs 75 million in FY 1984. In addition to its
normal operations DBM expects to participate, pending agreement on satisfactory
arrangements (para 4.07), in financing the term foreign exchange component of
projects proposed by the three local commercial banks. On the basis of pre-
liminary indications from the commercial banks, DBM projects such financing
of Rs 32 million (US$5.2 million equivalent) in FY 1980-81.
Resource Requirements
3.26      On the basis of sectoral needs reviewed above, DBM's overall re-
source requirements would amount to about Rs 138 million over EY 1980-FY 1982.
These estimates exclude loans to transport sector which are specifically
financed by the IDBI line of credit, and also excludes financing the foreign
component of projects proposed by the commercial banks (paras 3.25 and 4.07).
The requirements are in current terms based on estimates of international
inflation of 8% p.a., and local inflation of 10% in 1978 and an average of
12% in the period 1979-81 followed by 10% p.a. in 1982 and 1983.
3.27      DBM's resource needs over the period are expected to evolve as
follows (in Rs million):

3.28      To cover its gap of Rs 50 million (US$8.1 million) in foreign
exchange, DBM wishes to continue relying mainly on IBRD because of the
close historical association with the Bank and also to obtain IBRD's continued
financial and technical support for the institution while it operates in an
uncertain environment under new management. A loan of US$3 million, as
requested by DBM, is, thus, recommended for medium/large scale industry,
agroindustry and tourism projects and a further US$1 million is recommended
for the artisan/SSE projects, bringing IBRD's assistance to about 50% of
DBM's foreign exchange gap and 27% of its total foreign exchange requirements
through FY 1982. The remaining US$4.1 million should be readily available
from any of DBM's numerous other sources of foreign exchange finance and
DBM has already contacted some of them. In addition the proposed Bank loan
includes the equivalent of US$2 million for financing the term foreign
exchange needs of projects proposed by the three local commercial banks (para
4.07). The local currency resource gap of Rs 32 million will partly be met by
new equity contributions, and the remainder by net cash generation or borrow-
ing. Government has confirmed that it will ensure adequate local currency
resources for DBM.
Projected Financial Condition and Performance
3.29      The basic hypothesis underlying DBM's project-ions are in the Project
File. Projected balance sheets, income stateiments and isources and uses of
funds for the period FY 1980-EY 1984 are summarized in Alnnexes 10 to 13.
DBM's assets would increase from Rs 376 million in kY 1980 to Rs 486 million
in FY 1984.  Its financial condition would remain sound:  As per a June 1979
amendment to its Act, DBM's paid in share capital will increase by Rs 18.6
million to Rs 50.0 million in FY 1980.  The long term debt/equity ratio 1/
will moderately decrease from 2.7 in FY 1980 to 2.5 in FY 1984.  Provisions
will remain at 4.3% of the equity and loan portfolio ancd the liquidity position
will remain acceptable throughout the five year period. Profitability will
continue to be adequate. Net profit as % of average net worth will reach
about 11% in FY 1982 and remain at about 11-12% throughout the projection
period, and should allow DBM to build up its reserves to 58% of total equity
at end FY 1984, as compared to 39% at end FY 1980. Thus DBM is forecast to
continue to be a financially sound and creditworthy instituticon through the
projection period despite the current economic environment.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Objectives of the Project
4.01       In line with the objective of the Governments 1975-80 Development Plan,
DBM will continue to invest to create new industrial and commercial employment
1/   Debt excluding Sinking Fund and that portion of Government subordinated
loans falling due after the last maturities of IBRD loans. Equity
including share capital and reserves plus that same portion of Government
subordinated loan.

opportunities and diversify the economy away from sugar. However in the near
term, unless the promotion program being undertaken in Europe develops many
new investment opportunities, the level of investment in the medium- and
large-scale industrial and tourism sectors will remain depressed. However DBM
will seek to financially assist new investments whether initiating from abroad
or from Mauritian investors (via the commercial banks if appropriate). It is
in the Mauritian artisan and small scale enterprise sectors that the signi-
ficant scope for employment creation lies in the near term. DBM intends to
continue to develop these sectors through financial and technical assistance
to the entrepreneurs. The recently agreed technical assistance program to
be placed under DBM or the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and financed by
UNDP, will allow more comprehensive technical assistance to be provided whilst
IBRD finance will help expansion of the financing program to the artisan/SSE
sector. DBM will also continue financing the mechanization of the sugar
estates to alleviate their harvesting problems and play an important role in
plans for developing further urban or rural industrial estates.
4.02      As regards existing operations, efforts will be made to further
improve supervision of the portfolio as well as reconstruction of projects
with acute operational and financial problems. Additionally continued effort
will be made to lease Coromandel and ensure proper maintenance of DBM's
industrial estates.
4.03      Thus further IBRD financial assistance would provide DBM the foreign
resources to continue the above investment program and IBRD supervision would
allow the Bank to assist in the further development of DBM's internal oper-
ations (particularly the supervision and reconstruction programs).
B.   Description of the Project
4.04      Apart from one credit to finance the development of the Coromandel
Industrial Estate, previous IDA and IBRD lending to DBM has been essentially
to finance the requirements of medium and large scale industry, agro-industry
and tourism projects. Under the proposed new Loan, IBRD is seeking to expand
the scope of its financing into two new areas i.e., Small Scale Enterprises
and financing through commercial banks. The sectors to be financed under the
proposed loan of US$6 million are as follows:
(a) Medium and Large Scale Industry, Agro-industry and Tourism
4.05      As requested by DBM, US$3 million would be allocated to finance
investments in medium/large scale industry, agro-industry and tourism pro-
jects, i.e. 20% of DBM's requirements in foreign exchange over the period.
The remainder could be easily covered by DBM's numerous other foreign sources.
(b) Artisan/Small Scale Enterprises
4.06      Given the depressed prospects for medium/large scale foreign invest-
ment in Mauritius at present, the SSE/artisan sector represents an important
source of new jobs if the unemployment situation is to be eased at much lower
costs per new job created (about Rs 5,000-Rs 7,000/job, in the informal



- 24 -
sector and about Rs 15,000 for small scale enterprises) than for larger scale
projects (about Rs 75,000). DBM is forecasting commitments for artisan/SSE at
Rs 1.75 million for FY 1980, Rs 2.25 million in FY 1981 and Rs 2.7 million in
FY 1982. The indirect foreign exchange component of such lending is estimated
at about 60% i.e., US$250,000 to US$300,000/year. Government in view of its
acute shortage of foreign exchange and budget constraints is interested in
IBRD financial support for this program and has agreed to carry the foreign
exchange risk at no cost to the subborrowers. A component of US$1 million
is therefore proposed to cover the foreign exchange component of SSE/artisan
investment by SSEs/artisans, as defined by DBM (para 3.03). (As and when the
second phase of the Rural Development project is implemented, there could be
a significant increase in SSE finance demand from clients on the rural mini-
industrial estates proposed under that project).
(c) Financing of Mauritian Commercial Banks Term Foreign Exchange Needs
Through DBM
4.07      During appraisal, the mission proposed to DBM a scheme whereby DBM
would finance with IBRD funds, the term foreign exchange component of projects
being prepared and financed by the three Mauritian owned commercial banks,
i.e., the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB), State Commercial Bank (SCB), and
the Indian Ocean International Bank, Ltd. The reason for such a scheme, is
that there are private investors in Mauritius, having close relations with
their commercial banks (particularly MCB), who will not seek finance from DBM
for their investment projects because either their assets are already largely
secured to the commercial bank or because they are not prepared to disclose to
DBM, a Government institution, the detailed information (some of which is over
and above what is needed to ascertain a project's viability) DBM normally
requires to establish creditworthiness. Also because of the poor foreign
exchange situation in Mauritius, the commercial banks cannot finance such
projects with term local currency funds and then arrange appropriate foreign
exchange cover through the Central Bank; hence DBM is the main foreign exchange
source for such projects. Given the depressed level of medium/large scale
investment in Mauritius, it is important that all potential investment oppor-
tunities are pursued and the Minister of Finance agreed in principle to the
proposed scheme without discussing details.
4.08      While DBM has made preliminary investigations into the potential
term foreign exchange requirements of client enterprises of the commercial
banks, it has not defined with the commercial banks the mechanism whereby DBM
would assist in meeting these requirements with IBRD funds. At negotiations
it was agreed that a February Bank mission would seek to assist DBM in the
deveLopment of such a mechanism, and that in preparation for the mission DBM
would meet with the commercial banks to discuss:
(a) their projects and foreign exchange financing needs;
(b) methods of financing these projects possibly by:
(i) DBM lending directly to the commercial banks for on-
lending to the investment enterprises; or



- 25 -
(ii) DBM lending directly to the investment enterprises whilst
seeking a commercial bank guarantee;
(c) fees, charges and interest rates to be levied by the institutions;
and
(d) methods of joint or separate appraisal, supervision and reporting.
A component of US$2 million is earmarked under the proposed loan for a fin-
ancing scheme with the commercial banks, subject to agreement on arrangments
satisfactory to the Mauritian Government, DBM and the IBRD. However, it was
agreed that if no acceptable mechanism is agreed upon by June 30, 1980 the
US$2 million thus earmarked would be made available to DBM for normal direct
financing operations for medium and large scale enterprises, thereby bringing
IBRD assistance to 74% of DBM's foreign exchange gap and 40% of its total
foreign exchange needs.
C.   Proposed Loan to DBM
Terms and Conditions
4.09      The proposed fifth Loan to DBM would carry the following conditions
for the medium/large scale enterprises and artisan/SSE components. (Terms
and conditions for the commercial bank refinancing will be decided upon once
agreement has been reached with the institutions concerned).
(a) Onlending Rates
(i)  Medium/large scale projects:  DBM will continue
to on-lend to subborrowers at a minimum of 12% plus
1% commitment fee.
(ii)  Artisan/SSE projects:  For amounts up to Rs 25,000,
DBM recently raised the interest rate from 6.5% to 9%
which is acceptable. The Bank has accepted the principle
that artisan/small scale enterprises may benefit from
a concessional rate or from cross subsidization. DBM has
agreed to seek to achieve real positive interest on such
lending in the future.
(b) Foreign Exchange Risk
(i) Medium/large scale projects: DBM will pass the risk
between the rupee and the dollar to subborrowers with
Government carrying the risk between the dollar and the
currencies of disbursement.



- 26 -
(ii) Artisan/small scale enterprises: In view of t:he very
small size of these subborrowers who only deal in local
currency, Government will carry the foreign exchange
risk at no fee in the interest of seeking to develop
and expand employment creation in these sectors.
(c) Free Limit
(i) Medium/large scale enterprises: Under the previous
loan 1481-MAS the free limit was raised to US$600,000
reflecting the quality of DBM's appraisal work. Although
we remain confident in DBM's appraisal capability, the
free limit will remain the same to permit IBRD to
review a minimum of subprojects.
(ii) Artisan/SSE enterprises: The Bank has reviewed DBM's
appraisal procedures for these enterpreneurs on previous
missions and consider them well designed and operated. DBM
will send the first five appraisals for which reimburse-
ment under the Bank loan is sought, for review and comment
after which other subprojects would be authorized under the
"free limit" system.
(iii) Aggregate Free Limit: The aggregate free limit will be
US$3 million.
(d) Amortization Schedule
(i) Medium/large scale projects: This component of the loan
would have a flexible amortization schedule that would
substantially conform with the aggregate of the amortiza-
tion schedules of subloans with a maximum maturity of
15 years including appropriate grace periods depending
on the nature of the subprojects.
(ii) Artisan/SSE projects: A fixed amortization schedule has
been agreed with DBM and Government generally conforming
to the forecast cumulative amortization schedules of the
subloans.
(e) Debt/Equity Ratio
The limit will be retained at 4:1.
Project Cost Estimates
4.10      The aggregate amount 1/ projected to be committed by DBM over FY
1980-FY 1982 is estimated at about Rs 138 million in current terms (para.
3.26) as follows:
1/   Excludes transport sector financing and projects financed with the
commercial banks.

Medium and large scale enterprises 1/ ...... Rs 110 million
Artisan/SSE ............. .................. Rs   7 million

DBM's projected operations through to June 30, 1982, and the forecast sources

4.11      Thus under this fifth Loan, and assuming that agreement will be
reached as to the utilization of the US$2 million component for financing
projects with the commercial banks, IBRD will be providing 27% of DBM's
foreign exchange resources and about 18% of the total resource requirements
for direct operations through to June 30, 1982.
1/   Includes sugar mechanization projects.
2/   Excludes transport sector operations financed through IDBI line of
credit.
3/   Excludes Rs 16.2 million in lines of credit from Caisse Centrale which
may not be used due to French procurement requirements.

Prolect Implementation
4.12      Reporting Requirements:  DBM has agreed to submit quarterly reports
as it has done under previous loans/credits including financial, statements,
resource position, statement of arrears and notes on subprojects encountering
serious operational difficulties. DBM will also continue to submit audited
annual accounts prepared by qualified accountants along with DBM's annual
report.
4.13      Procurement:  Procurement for the subprojects refinanced under
the loan will be in accordance with the standard IBRD practice for develop-
ment banks.
4.14      Disbursements:  The proceeds of the proposed fifth loan would be
disbursed on DBM subloans as follows:
(i) 100% of the foreign cost of goods and services into Mauritius;
(ii)  75% of the local cost for goods previously imported into
Mauritius through normal trade channels;
(iii) 60% of the local cost for goods produced in the territory of
the Guarantor from previously imported materials, provided that
the manufacturing cost of such goods includes a value added in
Mauritius of not more than 40% of the ex-factory price of such
goods;
(iv)  60% of the local cost of construction of industrial buildings
and hotels.
4.15      Under the artisan/small scale enterprise component, DBM will
cumulate invoices and present a global request for reimbursement to IBRD
on a monthly or quarterly basis. Actual invoices would be held by DBM and
made available for IBRD inspection on supervision missions. In addition DBM
has agreed that its auditors will annually review DBM's accounting records and
contracts concerning disbursements under the SSE component and provide IBRD
with an opinion as to their accuracy and completeness.
4.16      The rate of commitment will be in relation to forecast level of
operations and the securing of additional lines of credit by DBM. The Loan
is therefcre tentatively expected to be fully committed by the end of 1982
and fully disbursed two years later (Annex 14).
Benefits and Risks
4.17      The benefits of this project are essentially two-fold:



- 29 -
(a) through the subprojects to be financed by DBM including
for the first time, artisan/small scale enterprises the
project will be addressing itself to the basic objective
of Government's Development Plan, namely employment crea-
tion. The project will also provide term foreign exchange
resources for fixed capital investment which are in limited
supply at present in Mauritius; hence resources will be
available to maintain new investments;
(b) through continuing World Bank support to DBM, IBRD will
assist in the further institutional development of DBM
particularly with regard to its supervision activities
and the development of small scale operations.
4.18      As DBM is a financially sound and generally capable institution,
risks associated with this project relate to its rate of commitment. The
level of industrial investment in Mauritius is already depressed due to lack
of foreign investors and also labor related problems in Mauritius. Further
Government imposed salary increases, local labor problems and transportation
difficulties, coupled with little response to European promotion efforts could
lead to a further slowdown in investment demand and consequently slow commit-
ment of the loan.
Recommendations and Agreements Reached
4.19      A loan of US$6 million is recommended for DBM to meet part of its
foreign exchange resource requirements through June 1982; US$3 million for
medium and large scale industry, agroindustry and tourism projects, US$1
million for artisans/SSE financing, and US$2 million for financing the term
foreign exchange component of projects sponsored by clients of the three
locally owned commercial banks.
4.20      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following:
(a)  From Government:
(i) Government will carry the foreign exchange risk on
the artisan/SSE loan at no cost to DBM (para. 4.04);
(ii) A dialogue will be maintained between IBRD Govern-
ment ard DBM with the objective of seeking to achieve
real positive interest rate in the future (para. 3.16)
on DBM's onlending rate to artisans/SSE.
(iii) DBM will be provided with adequate local currency
resources to meet its operational needs (para. 3.18);
(iv) DBM will continue to pass the risk between the rupee and
the dollar to subborrowers with Government carrying the
risk between the dollar and the currencies of disburse-
ment (para. 4.07);



- 30 -
(v) the other onlending terms and conditions (para 4.07).
(b) From DBM:
(i)  the proposed terms and conditions of the Loan (para. 4.09);
(ii) the reporting requirements (para. 4.12);
(iii) justification of disbursement percentages (para. 4.14);
(iv) DBM will review with IBRD the extent of its investments
in the sugar sector (para. 1.22);
(v) disbursements will be against certificates of expenditure
under the SSE/artisan financing scheme and DBM's auditors
will annually review DBM's accounting records and contracts
concerning disbursements under the SSE component and
provide IBRD with an opinion as to their accuracy and
completeness (para. 4.15).
(vi) A dialogue will be maintained between IBRD Govern-
ment and DBM with the objective of seeking to achieve
real positive interest rate in the future (para. 3.16)
on DBM's onlending rate to artisans/SSE.
