public sector management and accountability by establishing results-based management
practices and improving fiduciary oversight; and (b) increase access, quality and
efficiency of the education, health and public transport services by modernizing the
education system; modernizing, decentralizing and integrating various levels of health
care; and strengthening the institutional and operational capacity of the public transport
sector.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
Objectives were not revised.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.      The Country Partnership Strategy (Report No. 42677-BR, May 6, 2008, CPS)
for FY 2008-2011, completed just before Project appraisal, noted Brazil’s solid
progress with respect to improving macroeconomic stability and equity. Poverty
decreased, as did income inequality. However, the global financial crisis was beginning
to have a negative impact on economic growth. Some states responded to the situation by
introducing reforms to improve the efficiency and quality of services in sectors that
accounting for a significant share of Government expenditures. The first states to
introduce some of these reforms were Minas Gerais, Ceará, Pernambuco and the Federal
District (Distrito Federal -- DF).
2.      At the time of Project preparation, the DF was the third largest urban area
in Brazil after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Its macroeconomic prospects were
generally favorable, with growth in fiscal income of 11 percent in 2007. Population
growth was greatly overburdening public sector services, which was serving a population
5-6 times higher than originally envisaged. Expenditures on human resources for
education and health had been increasing substantially since 2002, to the point that they
were squeezing out public investment. As a result, existing public services were
deteriorating and the Government of the Federal District (Governo do Distrito Federal --
GDF) was unable to expand to underserved areas mostly located outside the central urban
area.
3.      In May 2007, in response to growing inequality and pressure on public funds,
the incoming Governor, Mr. Arruda, launched an ambitious reform program to
improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of public expenditures. The public
sector management (PSM) reforms launched by GDF centered on the development of
Strategic Plans and Results Agreements (Termos de Compromisso -- RA) to be signed
with line secretariats and specific agencies focusing on priority areas. This was expected
to free up funds to enable an expansion of services in response to growing demands, and
an improvement existing services.
4.     GDF approached the World Bank (Bank) because it had insufficient funds to
implement its ambitious reforms, and a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) with a
Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) 1 was very compatible with Government’s own
Results-based Management (RBM) approach. GDF originally planned for a series of
four SWAps over a period of 10 years, beginning with the three sectors responsible for
most of GDF expenditures: education, health, and transport. All three sectors had a poor
and deteriorating coverage and quality of services, with markedly lower coverage and

procedures and staff.



                                                 1
quality in the periphery. Efficiency was also deemed to be low. In education, coverage of
early child development (ECD) education and secondary/vocational education were
found to be insufficient particularly in peripheral areas, and student performance, while
higher than the national average (but declining) in central DF, was fifty percent lower in
some of the more distant administrative units. High rates of age-grade distortion
contributed to low educational outcomes. In health, population pressure combined with
an increasing prevalence of non-communicable diseases due to population aging and
changing life styles, greatly increased demand, particularly for hospital level care.
Limited access to basic health care made the referral network more dysfunctional. An
absence of an adequate information system to manage care was seen as a barrier to
improved efficiency and effectiveness. In transport, problems were both institutional and
operational. Key entities such as the State Secretariat of Transport (Secretaria de Estado
de Transporte – SET) and the Federal District Transport Authority (Departamento de
Transporte Urbano do Distrito Federal -- DFTRANS) lacked staff with the needed
technical skills, information systems and regulatory framework, and had difficulties
supervising and managing the existing services. The population, on the other hand, faced
long trips due to the urban sprawl, and expensive and inefficient transport (infrequent off
peak hours, irregular schedules) encouraging illegal services.
5.     For the Bank, the provision of assistance to the GDF’s reform program fit
well with the CPS for 2008-2011 agreed with Brazil. The overarching pillar of the CPS
was to support growth, good governance and public sector management as a foundation
to address equity, competitiveness, and sustainability. The new CPS shifted the focus of
the World Bank assistance from federal to state level operations, and from increasing
coverage to improving quality of services and public expenditure.
6.     As for the Federal Government it was interested in state-level financing, as it
would allow it to drill down federal programs to the state and municipal levels and
enable it to align federal and state interventions. The Bank and the Federal
Government were also interested in limiting the proliferation of multiple small loans and
sought the aggregation of several programs into single loans to leverage results and
reduce transactions costs. The Brazilian SWAp was the product of close collaboration
between federal and subnational Governments and the World Bank. This period
witnessed the development of several state multi-sectoral SWAps, including Ceará,
Minas Gerais, and Pernambuco.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The Project had two PDOs: (a) improve public sector management and
accountability by expanding results-based management practices and improving fiduciary
oversight; and (b) increase access, quality and efficiency of the public education, health
and transport services through the modernization of the education system; the
modernization, decentralization and integration of various levels of health care; and the
strengthening of the institutional and operational capacity of the public transport sector.




                                            2
8.      Progress towards achievement of the PDOs was to be measured through a set
of 28 Project Development Indicators (PDIs). Thirteen of the PDIs were selected to be
also Disbursement-linked Indicators (DLIs), out of which two were defined as global
indicators to be measured every six months. The other eleven DLIs were to be measured
annually. Failure to comply with the first global indicator would block disbursements
until the target was met. The second global indicator would determine the percentage
allocation that each sector would receive every six months. No or partial compliance with
the other DLIs would result in proportionally lower disbursements based on an agreed
algorithm. Overachievement on all DLIs would result in a “bonus?. In addition, there
were 15 un-linked PDIs. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) did not distinguish
between key outcome indicators and intermediate outcome and output indicators.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

9.     The PDO remained valid and unchanged throughout the Project’s implementation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

10.     The Project’s main beneficiaries were users of public education, health and
transport services in GDF, and particularly in low-income areas. Service users would
see an improvement in access and quality of services. Efficiency gains and a focus on
results were expected to improve resource allocation, slowly reducing service inequalities
between Brasilia and the peripheral regions. The 26 agencies and secretariats
participating in the management reforms would benefit from the improvement of their
management skills.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

11.     The Project included two components. The first followed a SWAp approach to
support GDF’s public sector management reform, and the second consisted of a technical
assistance (TA) component designed to support the fulfillment of targets in the first.

12.    Component 1. Strengthening Results-based Management in the Public Sector
(US$390 million, total Project cost; US$120 million, loan financing). This component
would support the adoption of RBM tools, including the signing of annual RAs between
the Governor and each of the line secretariats and agencies of the DF, and the submission
of annual reports on performance with respect to agreed targets. Subject to legislature
approval, the GDF intended to introduce rewards (e.g., additional budget, bonus
payments) for those entities that met or exceeded their performance targets in health and
education.

13.     EEPs selected for financing were designed to introduce or expand reforms to
improve the effectiveness, quality and equity of services in these sectors. In education, it
was expected that the expansion of the Shared Management program (Gestão
Compartilhada), whereby principals would be selected on the basis of qualifications
rather than political appointment, and where incentives would be given to schools based


                                             3
on teacher and student’s increased performance would improve efficiency, quality and
performance. Expanding access to ECD programs and the Full-time Schools program
(Escola de Tempo Integral), which provides longer and better learning opportunities than
traditional schools, would improve access to education (reducing inequity) and in the
latter case, also improve quality. The focus of these investments was to be low-income
areas and areas with low Basic Education Development Index (Indice de
Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica – IDEB) scores. In health, improvement in access
and quality focused on the expansion of primary care through the Family Health Program
(Programa de Saúde da Família – FHP). The expansion of FHP would strengthen
prevention and resolve less complicated health problems at a lower level of care,
decreasing patient overload in hospitals while improving service quality and health
outcomes. The latter would also reflect a more efficient use of health resources.
Efficiency would also be improved through the introduction of patient electronic health
cards (Cartão de Saúde), through the piloting of the subcontracting of the management of
the Hospital Sta. Maria to a non-profit social organization with the purpose of improving
hospital management, and through the establishment of RBM practices in the sector. In
transport, effectiveness and efficiency of SET and DFTRANS would be increased
through the establishment of a transport Control Center for Operations (Centro de
Controle Operacional – CCO), the preparation of an urban transport Master Plan, the
review and improvement of internal processes, the modernization of management
information systems and equipment, and building capacity of staff.

14.     Component 2. Building Capacity in the Public Sector (US$10 million total
Project cost and loan financing). In addition to financing TA and training to support the
implementation of RBM and the fulfillment of agreed performance targets, this
component was to finance preparatory studies for a possible future operation, and TA to
strengthen fiduciary oversight (of the Project). Specific TA was included for: (a) the
design and implementation of cost-accounting systems for education and health to permit
an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of specific services; (b) TA for assessments of
management programs in the education and health sectors (the education “Gestão
Compartilhada? program and the public-private partnership to be established to manage
the Hospital Sta. Maria); (c) an evaluation of outsourcing of some services in these two
sectors (“Merenda Escolar? and hospital transport); (d) inputs to efforts of SET and
DFTRANS to integrate the different public transport modes and to regulate the provision
of public transport services in the DF; (e) an impact evaluation of the Government’s
Management Modernization program; (f) training on Strategic Planning, M&E, and the
definition of indicators for the State Secretariat of Planning and Management (Secretaria
de Estado de Planejamento e Gestão – SEPLAG), Health, Education, SET and
DFTRANS; and (g) TA to strengthen Financial Management (FM) and Procurement
capacity including the development of Financial Management and Procurement Action
Plans, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) exercise, and the
modernization of the procurement processes of the Central Bidding Committee (Central
de Compras – CBC) and the participating secretariats.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

17.     Project design contained several elements that are considered best practice.
The Project used Government procedures and staff to the extent possible, seeking to
foster ownership, reduce transactions costs and strengthen local Government systems. It
also linked disbursements to the achievement of results, which has been shown to lead to
improved performance and management (IEG, 2009 p. xii). Besides the traditional
assessments,2 the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA)
informed financial management arrangements and defined an action plan to address weak
areas. Training in procurement using OECD indicators was carried out during project
preparation. The procurement action plan to strengthen institutional capacity in GDF was
to be finalized during the first semester of implementation.
18.     The Government demonstrated a high degree of commitment to the
operation at the highest levels. In addition, the administration was perceived as
truly reformist and ready to implement an innovative project. Project preparation
was led by the SEPLAG, and an effective preparation team was assembled. The
Governor and SEPLAG’s Secretary took the lead in many of the discussions on the scope
of the Project. Together, they convened the other sectors and obtained their commitment
and participation. The Government’s team prepared a detailed Project proposal (Carta
Consulta) that served as the basis for the development of the PAD. Focal points from the
three sectors (education, health and transport/DFTRANS) and SEPLAG worked closely
in the definition of Project indicators and the selection of EEPs to be supported by the
operation. Overall, GDF’s preparation team was very responsive and proactive in its
work with the Bank team, all of which contributed to a timely Project preparation.
19.    The lending instrument and approach adopted was in line with the CPS of
2008-2011. Bank management viewed the SWAp as a cutting-edge approach and
encouraged risk taking with regards to RBM-based reforms. Partly inspired by the
success of the Minas Gerais “Partnership for Development? Development Policy Loan
(DPL) that introduced RBM in all state Government secretariats, SWAps adopted the
RBM aspects and tried to introduce more flexible disbursement mechanisms, while also
supporting local procurement and financial management procedures, whenever
acceptable to the World Bank.



2
 A social assessment was carried out, which provided useful inputs on the service delivery and local
management aspects of the programs financed. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) was carried out
yielding important feedback to the preparation team. Financial Management (FM) and Procurement
capacity assessments were carried out.



                                                 5
20.    The adoption of RBM in PSM was the cornerstone of the Project. The signing
and evaluation of RAs were included as DLI to give them priority. But, there was no
discussion in the PAD as to how RAs would be evaluated or how they would be tracked.
M&E capacity, crucial for the monitoring of results, was not assessed. Given this Project
linked disbursements to results, the assessment and design of an M&E system should
have been given greater attention. As no outcome indicator was included to measure
changes in public sector management derived from the signing of RAs, it is difficult to
determine if management practices changed even if the indicators are met.
21.     At the time of Project preparation only one multi-sector state-level SWAp
had already been completed (Ceará) and thus lessons learned from implementation
were limited.3 Some of the fiduciary arrangements had not been ironed out within the
Bank, which led to shortcomings in Project design. For instance, the algorithm linking
disbursements to results was too complex, and somehow failed to effectively link
disbursements to results - the Project would disburse once a year regardless of whether
any sectoral indicators (other than global indicators) were met. There was lack of clarity
on whether the Bank procurement rules should apply to the full program or only to the
financed share. On the legal side, while the Project called for the hiring of an independent
annual technical audit to verify the data submitted by the Government, particularly for
DLIs, the Loan Agreement did not make disbursements contingent on the review by such
independent technical audit. Thus, disbursements took place without validation from a
detailed independent review.
22.     Finally, insufficient caution was exercised in Project design to protect it from
possible threats to good governance. Much was made of the administration’s improved
fiscal prudence and reformist approach. While this seemed an important positive break
from the previous administration known to have had a history of corruption, the
recentness of the change called for the team to make more in-depth assessments of
implementation and fiduciary risk. The only related risk identified in the risk matrix was
the possibility that a new administration might not follow up on the reforms.

2.2 Implementation

23.    One month after Project effectiveness, 4 there were serious allegations of
corruption involving the executive, legislative and judicial branches of Government.
The scandal led to the arrest of the Governor. Soon afterwards the Deputy Governor, who
took his place in February 2010, resigned. By January 2011, when a newly elected
Government came on board, there had been five different Governors since the Project had
been approved. The corruption allegations were not related with this or another Bank-
financed project in the DF, and the Bank’s thorough fiduciary review following the
scandal did not uncover any wrongdoing on Bank-financed contracts in the DF.



3
  The main lesson from the Ceará project was that indicators needed to be carefully selected, ensuring they
are clearly defined and of high priority to the Government to affect the Project’s success.
4
  The Project was approved on April 9, 2009, signed on September 10, 2009 and declared effective on
October 15, 2009.


                                                    6
24.     These events5 essentially paralyzed the Project until about May 2011, and
caused a major blow to implementation from which the Project would never
recover. Each change in Governor led to changes in secretaries, and to changes in both
staffing and administrative structure in each of the sectors, and often to some changes in
policy. The State Secretariat of Education (Secretaria de Estado de Educação -- SEE)
had six different Secretaries since the Project was prepared, Health had five, Transport
had four, and DFTRANS had five. More importantly, the Secretariat leading the reform,
SEPLAG, had seven.6 All these changes resulted in delays given new staff had to become
acquainted with the Project, and to a total loss of ownership.
25.     The Project Coordination Unit (Unidade de Coordenação do Projeto -- PCU)
team also underwent changes, and its isolation under subsequent administrations
reduced the Project’s potential to succeed. The team’s composition and leadership
changed in March 2010 and its location within SEPLAN changed as well. The PCU went
from reporting directly to the Secretary of SEPLAN to reporting to the Assistant
Secretary of Management Modernization within SEPLAN. It had limited access to
decision makers within SEPLAN and reduced convening power vis-à-vis the other
implementing partners. A subset of the March 2010 PCU team remained in the team until
Project closing.
26.     In addition, the PCU lacked capacity to assume all of its responsibilities as
defined in the Project’s Operational Manual (OM). The PCU team was to monitor and
evaluate Project activities, both technical and financial, including following up on the
achievement of agreed targets. Regular supervision meetings did not take place outside of
Bank missions. PCU did not review data submitted by sectors, which were inconsistent
over time and some were inconsistent with protocols in the OM. All these factors did not
help to rebuild a sense of ownership amongst sectoral implementers.
27.     Deficiencies were found in Project management, FM, procurement and M&E.
There was an inability to effect procurement of goods and services under the Bank
guidelines and delays in carrying out the financial audit. The needed procurement
specialist for the Project was never hired, nor was the required independent technical
audit consultancy.
28.     The seriousness of the situation was reflected in the Project’s poor
performance as measured by the PDIs in Component 1, and the lack of any progress
in Component 2. After the first year, when a total of seven out of 25 indicators were met
(28 percent), achievement of targets declined to five (20 percent) from 2010-2012. None
of the activities identified in the PAD under Component 2 were carried out. There were
long delays in preparing an acceptable procurement plan (approved in September 2010
conditional on some adjustments). Loan funds were not advanced until April 2011, and it
took four more months (August 2011) before the team was able to utilize the funds. The

  SEPLAG’s name also changed, becoming the State Secretariat of Planning and Budget (Secretaria de
Estado de Planejamento e Orçamento – SEPLAN) in January 2011, which is how this ICR will refer to it
from this point on.


                                                 7
law authorizing the Bank loan only allowed the use of funds for investment, excluding
technical assistance, and the Government team did not make the necessary amendments
to the law prior to the arrival of the funds. Further delays ensued in the procurement of
consultancies because of lack of adequate Terms of Reference (TORs). And, when TORs
had been approved, there were often further delays as procurement processes required the
approval of the DF Attorney General’s office (Procuradoria Geral do DF), generally not
acquainted with Bank procurement procedures.
29.     Some progress was made on Component 2 after GDF requested Bank
support to develop programs and capacity in its State Secretariat of Transparency
and Control (Secretaria Estadual de Transparencia e Controle -- SETC), created in
May 2011. The Bank agreed and some training for auditors was financed, as were 15
individual consultancies mainly designed to evaluate options, develop methodologies,
and develop training materials. On request by SEPLAN, SETC carried out an ex-post
technical audit of Project indicators in the end of 2012. In 2012, the number of
implementing secretariats under this component was expanded, although many never
carried out the planned studies. Those that did included the State Secretariat of
Government (Secretaria de Estado de Governo) and the State Secretariat of Social
Development and Income Transfer (Secretaria de Estado de Desenvolvimento Social e
Transferencia de Renda -- SEDEST). The State Secretariat of Government carried out 13
individual consultancies, 10 of which focused on social participation. Some of the studies
are not related to Project objectives.
30.     By Project closing, only 19.7 percent of the loan was utilized. GDF sent its first
request for retroactive financing for US$26 million in December 2009 soon after the
corruption scandal. Given the risk involved, the Bank obtained agreement from the newly
elected administration in 2011 to not claim reimbursements for the years 2008 and 2009,
as well as the first semester of 2010, in order to completely de-link the Project with the
past administration. Thus, there was no retroactive financing. Total disbursements for the
Project amounted to US$ 26,064,934. (Refer to Annex 1 for costs by component).
31.     The Bank moved quickly to assess to what extent its portfolio with GDF was
affected, carrying out a detailed fiduciary assessment that included a complete review of
all procurement processes and financial management reports, including 11 contracts with
five companies that had been named in the corruption case. Although the reviews related
to the Project were not qualified, the Bank did not consider any disbursements until after
the newly elected administration came on board in January 2011.
32.     The Bank also considered triggering the cross-suspension remedy in the
General Conditions in May of 2010, when the Brasilia Sustentável Project was
suspended, because of the numerous changes in Government authorities, and the lack of
implementation progress. However, after some discussion it was decided that the
Government taking office after elections should be given a chance to move the Project
forward. Afterwards, lack of evidence of non-compliance with legal covenants due to
insufficient recording of Project issues in Project files impeded any legally-related action.




                                             8
33.    A mission visited Brasilia in February 2011 to meet with new authorities and
implementing teams, and assess to what extent the Project was still relevant to
GDF’s priorities. They also set out to work with the PCU to establish a minimum
operating environment, meeting with new staff in participating sectors to disseminate
information about the Project, and providing training for GDF staff on FM and
procurement.
34.     On the technical side, the mission found that objectives and most activities
were still relevant, and the incoming Government was interested in re-launching the
Project, extending it by 18 months and adjusting some of the indicators and their
targets. During that mission, the Bank team worked with the GDF team to review
adjustments needed to Project indicators. A subsequent mission in June 2011 reviewed
the proposed Project indicators and their targets and found them to be in line with Project
objectives. It also worked to include other secretariats under Component 2. It was agreed
the formal request for restructuring should reach the Bank for its review and approval
soon after the mission.
35.     Despite the fact that a new Government was in place, implementation did not
improve and important shortcomings on Bank supervision were also observed. 7
Even under a new administration, delays in the preparation of progress reports and IFRs
continued for the duration of the Project. The request for restructuring was not submitted
until October 20, 2011, after the Bank had held an internal review of the Project and
decided not to restructure it due to its poor performance.8 In 2012, there was minimal
supervision activity, other than procurement approvals for studies under Component 2,
which is understandable given the decision made in December 2011 to not extend the
Project.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

36.     The Project utilized data already available to GDF. Although indicator
protocols were generally fairly well defined, there were several indicators that
lacked sufficient detail, and ended up being improperly calculated in progress
reports. A results framework identifying the levels of the various indicators (key
outcomes, and intermediate outcomes and outputs) and their links to each other and to the
PDOs was not prepared. The first PDO lacks outcome measures and the second PDO
lacks outcome or output measures for some sectors, and those included are not
necessarily linked. A system to track compliance with RAs was needed to assess the
gains resulting from the use of RBM, but this was not contemplated in the design.
37.    The PCU was tasked with monitoring Project progress, ensuring the quality
of the data submitted, and building the capacity of the different sectors for M&E,
but overall M&E capacity was insufficient. Each secretariat assigned a focal point to
oversee Project activities, and the data were put together by each secretariat’s statistical
unit. Monitoring of implementation was limited, and the quality of the data was not

    A formal letter was sent to GDF in December 2011 to that effect.


                                                      9
reviewed. Given the frequent changes in staffing that took place at the participating
secretariats, many incoming staff did not understand the protocols for many indicators,
and the PCU did not ensure they did. The Project allocated funds for training in strategic
planning, definition of indicators, and M&E for staff of SEPLAN and the participating
secretariats through Component 2, but no training was provided.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

38.      None of the Safeguard Policies are triggered by the Project design, as
envisioned construction was expected to consist of minor repairs to schools and health
clinics.
39.    The Project operated in a high fiduciary risk environment, difficult to
predict, soon after effectiveness, although financial management risk was assessed to be
moderate and procurement risk as average at the time of appraisal.
40.     Weaknesses identified during Project preparation and the PEFA assessment
were to be addressed through an agreed FM Action Plan to be financed through
Component 2.9 The plan left key actions related to improving internal controls to the
first and second years of implementation in a three-year project. Given that the Bank had
limited experience working with GDF this might have been overly optimistic.
41.     Weaknesses in GDF’s financial management capabilities resulted in
important delays. By March 2011, the first audit report (2008-2009) had yet to be
carried out. The Bank agreed to waive that audit report and for the first six months of
2010, as there were no Bank-financed expenditures during the period. The Bank agreed
to have the Federal District Court of Accounts (Tribunal de Contas do Distrito Federal --
TCDF) carry out the external audits. The audit for the second semester of 2010 was
furnished with a significant delay, mainly because the Bank had delayed more than four
months in giving feedback to TCDF on the audit TORs, which were not approved until
November 2011. The 2011 audit was submitted in November 2012, and the report noted
that several weaknesses detected in 2010 had not been addressed, most related to
weaknesses in the PCUs ability to manage the finances of the Project. The PEFA to be
carried out under the Project, to complement the one from the design phase, was never
executed.
42.    A draft Procurement Action Plan, which was to be finalized during the first
semester of implementation and financed through Component 2, was prepared on
the basis of the Procurement Assessment. The assessment included only SEPLAG’s
Central Bidding Committee (Central de Compras -- CBC) because it would carry out all
procurement processes under the Project. The CBC also suffered significant staff rotation



9
  The FM assessment carried out during preparation noted that GDF had satisfactory FM arrangements to
meet Bank’s requirements, and indicated that some aspects of FM arrangements were still under
development. It noted weak internal controls in the four implementing entities, and the need to strengthen
SEPLAG’s coordination and monitoring and evaluation capacity. The use of multiple non-integrated
software systems weakened the reliability of reporting.


                                                   10
due to the corruption scandal, and loss of staff (and later a restructuring). No procurement
was carried out under Component 1 until its final year because of lack of procurement
capacity. Delays in the approval of procurement plan delayed access to Component 2
funds. In addition, DF’s Attorney General’s office had to approve all procurement and
they were unaware of agreed procedures.
43.    Neither FM nor Procurement teams at the Bank carried out a reassessment
of FM and procurement capacity after the significant change in staff following the
corruption scandal.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

44.      Although originally envisioned as the first in a series of multisector SWAps,
no follow-on operation will take place. GDF, however, through the Sub-Secretariat of
Management Modernization of SEPLAN, is continuing with its RBM program, using a
modified instrument. Although several of the previous RAs have not been renewed, some
new entities have been included. According to a report from the Coordination of
Institutional Planning unit (Coordenação de Planejamento Institucional -- COPLAN)
who is leading this effort within the Sub-Secretariat of Management Modernization, RAs
are monitored every three months and evaluated annually. They will soon begin piloting
software used in the Federal Government to monitor RAs. Of the second generation of
RAs to be signed, health will be the first to use the new software.
45.     Financing for the three sectors continues as before the Project was
implemented, and thus sectors will not have the additional funds needed to continue
to expand coverage. Given the limited expansion achieved in most programs, recurrent
costs will not be much higher than before. Most programs supported in education, many
of which also received federal funding, were modified and or discontinued under
subsequent Secretaries of Education. Given federal funding is tied to the implementation
of federal programs, some of the funding for GDF may have been lost. Most programs
financed in Health receive federal funding and thus support for FHP and the
implementation of the health card will continue. Transport is introducing a different
subcontracting approach with bus companies that is expected to give it the control of
operations and revenue it needs, and is now preparing bidding documents for a CCO that
will function under the new system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

46.     Overall relevance of objectives, design and implementation is rated as
moderate. Relevance of objectives is assessed as high, as the objectives of the Project
continue to be relevant today and consistent with GDF’s stated priorities. The objectives
are also consistent with the 2012-2015 CPS, which includes improving the efficiency of
public spending and the increased coverage and quality of public services for low-income
households as two of its four strategic objectives. Relevance of design is assessed as
moderate given the insufficient focus of the Project on overall management improvement


                                            11
beyond the signing of RAs, insufficient focus on M&E capacity and arrangements,
complicated disbursement arrangements, and lack of alignment between Project design
and current education sector priorities where policies are still in flux. Implementation
relevance is low given the limited relevance the Project had in SEPLAN’s overall
development plans and objectives after the initial administration departed.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

47.   The Project had two objectives. The table in Annex 2 contains annual
measurements for all PDIs.

PDO 1: Improve public sector management and accountability: Not achieved.

48.     There are six output measures linked to PDO 1. The first two have to do with the
signing and annual evaluation of RAs signed between the Governor and the various
secretariats and agencies implementing Government policy. While the number of RAs to
be signed did meet its expected target of 26, and the number assessed annually reached
20, close to the target of 21, only 20 of the original 26 RAs were in active status by the
end of the Project. There was no measure of the management impact of signing and/or
evaluating RAs nor were any additional linked activities included to get a better sense of
any management changes taking place and thus their impact is unknown. Moreover, it is
unclear that the Project had any influence in the RA program. None of the other outputs
related to PDO 1 (the implementation of the FM and Procurement action plans, and the
introduction of incentives for good performance in education and health sectors) were
carried out.

PDO 2: increase access, quality and efficiency of the education, health and public
transport services): Not achieved for any of the three dimensions.

49.      Access: Overall, the PDO on access was not achieved as only two out of seven
indicators were achieved. Increasing access was an objective for both education and
health. In education, access was increased as measured by primary school completion
rates, but declined as measured by secondary school completion rates. The latter were
lower at the end of the Project (66 percent) than when it began (75 percent). Increased
enrollment in ECD programs and greater availability of full time schools were also to
reflect increased access. ECD enrollments also decreased over the life of the Project, and
no full time schools were established in the areas targeted by the Project. In health,
increased access would be reflected in FHP coverage expansion, and greater coverage of
prenatal care and Pap smear tests. FHP only reached half of the coverage expected and
coverage of Pap smear did not change. Coverage of prenatal care did increase coverage
even more than planned.
50.   Quality: The PDO on quality was not achieved, as only one out six indicators
was achieved (but the data are unreliable). Improved quality of education was
measured by an improvement in the Basic Education Development Index (Indice de




                                           12
Desenvolvimento da in Educação Básica – IDEB)10 of two percent each of the 125 low
performing primary schools selected in low-income areas. Of the 125, 66 schools met this
target. Increased primary and secondary school completion rates would also reflect
improved quality of education but as noted above, the later did not increase. The
programs included in the Project to improve quality (i.e. the Gestão Compartilhada
program and the full-time school program) were either discontinued or modified and thus
did not have the expected results. In health, quality of FHP services was to be measured
by a decrease in hospitalization rates for diabetes mellitus 11 and increase in infant death
investigations. For the first indicator, data varied considerably over time as the
measurement was based on a different set of hospitals in each measurement, some of
which did not provide services to treat diabetes and thus is considered unreliable. The
second one did increase from 40 percent to 64 percent but still significantly lower than its
90 percent target. In transport data from the indicator measuring improved quality
(reduction of complaints) is unreliable because DFTRANS changed the way it handled
complaints mid-project, and thus the data are not comparable over time.
51.     Efficiency: The PDO on efficiency was not met, as only one out of seven
indicators was achieved. In education, improved efficiency was measured with an index
based on four indicators12 that were regularly monitored in the Gestão Compartilhada
program, and by decreases in age-grade distortion (which would result in increased
efficiency by moving students through the system faster reducing the overall costs per
student). The Gestão Compartilhada program was modified in subsequent
administrations and the monitoring system was dropped, and both primary and secondary
school age-grade distortion programs were dropped as well. Thus, there are no data
measuring efficiency of school management and data on age-grade distortion in both
primary and secondary school decreased only about a third of what it was supposed to
have decreased. In health, the indicators for improved efficiency included the decrease in
hospitalization rates for diabetes mellitus, and the establishment of management the Santa
Maria Hospital by an OSC, which was cancelled after the change in administration. A
third indicator, the expansion of coverage of the health card, was met (surpassed) and
while it is an important input to a system to improve efficiency, it does not reflect
improved efficiency (it is an output measure). And in transport, the indicator on
efficiency, the trip and itinerary regularity index, is unavailable as the contract with the
firm managing the information system was cancelled after the corruption scandal and the
CCO was never contracted. An output indicator which would contribute to improving
efficiency, i.e. preparing a transport master plan, was met.




10
   IDEB is composed of test results of student performance in schools and grades, as measured by the
National Assessment Tests (Prova Brasil) and indicators of student flow (promotion, repetition and dropout
rates). It is carried out every two years by the Ministry of Education.
11
    The indicator is measured as the number of hospitalizations due to diabetes mellitus complications
divided by the total number of hospitalizations (excluding child birth) in the same place and period.
12
   The indicators were: (i) decrease in student absenteeism; (ii) decrease in teacher absenteeism; (iii)
decrease in student dropout rates; and (iv) full participation of School Council as informed by the school
monitoring system.

3.3 Efficiency

52.     An updated cost-benefit analysis was not prepared after Project completion
because so many activities were discontinued or were never introduced. Efficiency is
rated as low.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Unsatisfactory

53.    There were major shortcomings in the operation’s achievement of objectives. Its
relevance is moderate and its efficiency low.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a)    Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development – not applicable
(b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening – not applicable
(c)    Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative) – not
applicable

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

54.     Risk to development outcome differs by sector. In health the risk to
development outcome is low. In transport it is moderate. In PSM and education the risks
are significant.
55.     In PSM, as implemented through RBM, the most important risk to
development outcome is political. The institutionalization of RBM is weak and thus
very vulnerable to changes in commitment caused by changing authorities. Although new
entities have been included in the process, and new software will be used to monitor RAs,
not all who signed agreements are being evaluated.
56.    In education, most programs supported by the Project were modified and or
discontinued under subsequent administrations. The deterioration of many of the
education indicators over the lifetime of the Project clearly shows this. The most
important risk to development outcome in the education sector is also political. Every
new administration has made significant changes to education policy.
57.    In health the programs were all institutionalized before the Project began as
they are Ministry of Health initiatives and receive some federal funding. Thus the focus
on increasing access, quality and efficiency will continue, even if expansion is slower.
58.   In transport, although little was achieved through the Project, their focus
remains on improving quality and efficiency but some of the initiatives have now
been rethought. The GDF is introducing a different subcontracting approach with bus
companies that are expected to give them the control of operations and revenue that they


                                           14
need, and are now preparing bidding documents for a CCO that will function under the
new system. However, lobbying by powerful bus companies could derail their attempt to
gain control of the operations of public urban transport.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

59.     Bank performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Shortcomings in
Project design were mainly in fiduciary and M&E arrangements, both of which
constitute crucial elements of well-functioning SWAps. The disbursement algorithm
linking disbursements to results was complex. Moreover, disbursements were not made
conditional on the contracting of the external technical audit. M&E capacity, crucial for
the monitoring of results, was not assessed. Given this Project linked disbursements to
results, the assessment and design of an M&E system to track results should have been
given greater attention. And, given the importance that the process of evaluation of RAs
may have in generating management change, greater focus should have been given to it
in the design. Finally, governance risks were underestimated. The team took some risks
adopting an innovative approach that had been insufficiently tested, which at the time
both the Federal Government and the Bank encouraged. However, the shortcomings
proved to have a significant detrimental effect on Project performance.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Unsatisfactory

60.     Handling the corruption scandal posed a significant challenge for the
supervision team. The continuous changes in Government authorities from that moment
until new elections were held meant there was no effective counterpart to deal with,
making it difficult to supervise. Nevertheless, there were several aspects of supervision
that had major shortcomings even after the new Government came on board in 2011.
61.     Despite the fact disbursement was linked to results, supervision visits after
June 2010 did not report on PDIs. With the exception of supervision of the transport
sector, which prepared separate Aide Memoires, it is unclear when and how data
submitted were reviewed. Given that no technical audit was contracted, and that
disbursements were conditioned on results, the supervision team should have given this
issue greater attention. None of the Aide Memoires discuss the content of either the RAs
or their evaluation (although the first Aide Memoire notes it should be reviewed), when
they were a key focus of the Project.
62.   An important shortcoming of supervision was the insufficient documentation
on Project progress and issues. There are only three Project aide memoires available for




                                           15
the 3.3 years of Project implementation 13 . A partial, unfinished Aide Memoire was
available for a fourth mission (June 2011). Although interviews with the PCU revealed
brief two-day visits by the Bank had been made, no record of them exists in Project files.
Some visits did not include sectoral team members, except for transport. Because there is
only a limited amount of information in Project files for the last two years of supervision,
it is not clear what was addressed by the Bank team.
63.     Response times with respect to FM issues were slow. There were significant
delays in the approval of the final TORs for Project audits. FM also did not always record
important decisions and sometimes did not communicate them to the team.
64.    The Bank team did not carry out a full reassessment of capacity in
procurement and FM once the Government was in place. FM did carry out a desk
review to monitor the continuing adequacy of the Project’s FM arrangements. In
hindsight, this would have been a good entry point for discussions with GDF on setting
up a minimum environment for Project implementation.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

65.    Since Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is Moderately Unsatisfactory
and quality of supervision is Unsatisfactory, overall Bank performance is rated as
Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

66.     The Government includes the Governor’s office, SEFAZ and TCDF. While the
Government in office during Project preparation was very committed to the Project,
subsequent authorities did not share its enthusiasm and did not prioritize the Project.
SEFAZ was well staffed and had generally good performance, respecting the segregation
of duties, but with no satisfactory internal controls. Two Project audits were carried out
by the TCDF (a third one is under preparation), and were well prepared. Both were
delayed, although the first one was due to the Bank’s delay in approval of TORs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

67.   Implementing Agencies performance is rated as Highly Unsatisfactory
because of severe shortcomings in the implementation of the Project. Implementing




13
     October 2009, June 2010 and February 2011.



                                                  16
entities include the SEPLAN and its PCU, and the three sector State Secretariats (SEE,
SES, and SET/DFTRANS). The loss of priority of the Project under the current
Government, and SEPLAN in particular, is a key reason for its poor performance. The
Project was not on SEPLAN decision-makers’ radar screen. Project implementation was
severely affected by the constant change of authorities and staff after the corruption
scandal. The loss of ownership amongst all implementers was significant.
68.     Project ownership on the part of implementing secretariats was low,
particularly in Education where political differences with other authorities continued to
interfere with policies and programs.
69.     Sectoral secretariats had difficulties in submitting consistent monitoring
indicator data and financial data to the PCU. Procurement capacity was also weak and
the only procurement carried out by the sectors was in Health during the final year of the
Project. Given the PCU did not provide the needed support to them, as defined in the
Project Operational Manual, problems with data persisted to the end.
70.     Project management was deficient, and the planning function at the PCU was
weak. Coordination meetings with the sector state secretariats only took place at very
early stages of Project implementation, and thus the only forum available to build
ownership, encourage cross-fertilization, and generate cohesion was not used. Project
progress reports prepared by the PCU were frequently delayed, as were IFRs. No
progress reports were prepared for the period January to June 2011 and for July-
December 2012. Poor planning also caused delays in access to funds from Component 2
once they were available. Follow-up of project issues with the Bank frequently
experienced significant delays, as was evident with the submission of the request for
restructuring – eight months after discussions with the Bank had been initiated. Financial
management also had some problems although many of them were due to deficiencies in
the data submitted by implementing secretariats. Issues noted in the first audit were not
addressed in the next audit (only two audits have been carried out to date). Although the
PCU had no procurement capacity it never hired the necessary support.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Highly Unsatisfactory

71.    Given Government performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory and
implementing agency performance is rated as Highly Unsatisfactory, Overall Borrower
Performance is rated as Highly Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

72.     Strong Government and implementing entity ownership and capacity are
critical for effective design and implementation. GDF was very proactive in the design
stage, but ownership was lost when implementation began, due to changes in
administrations.
73.   Project design needs to introduce safeguards to protect the Project in case of
a change in political situation, particularly when taking risks with a new instrument


                                           17
and new counterparts. Specific conditionalities can be introduced to shield aspects of
the Project that could significantly affect Project outcomes if not implemented as agreed.
Preparation teams tend to be overly optimistic, particularly when faced with effective and
reformist counterparts, and forget that Government administrations change periodically,
bringing with them changes in priorities and staffing.
74.    Assessing changes in management practices has to go beyond the signing and
evaluation of RAs. RBM was a cornerstone of this operation. There is little if any
involvement in the monitoring of those RAs or their evaluation. And if there are no
outcome measures to assess change in management practices, DLIs can be met without
having an impact on the PDO.
75.     M&E should be part of fiduciary review package, particularly if disbursing
against results. This would include preparing a solid log frame; developing measurable
indicators; and establishing viable M&E arrangements. Moreover, the hiring of the
technical audit should carry the same weight as the hiring of the financial audit. And, it
should be made conditional on disbursements.
76.     The “flexibility? expected through the Sector Wide Approach added more
complexity and limited the ability of implementing secretariats to make the
necessary investments. Bank fiduciary rules and reporting systems remained a challenge
even though the Project design intended to introduce more flexible arrangements.
Considerable difficulty was experienced in the identification of EEPs for reimbursement.
At first, difficulties arose because the Bank demanded that contracts to be reimbursed
must contain the anti-fraud and anti-corruption clause that ongoing contracts did not
have. Later, only non-procurable expenditures could be reimbursed because of the GDF
inability to carry out procurement under Bank rules.
77.    Consistent recording of project events and issues is necessary for
management to be able to make informed decisions regarding projects. The Project
team explored avenues to suspend disbursements when it was evident Project
performance would not improve, but was unable to do so because it needed evidence on
non-compliance of covenants, which was not recorded.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Achievement of Targets

1.      The Project’s poor performance was reflected in its limited achievement of
Project Development Indicators (PDI) targets. The PAF indicator (global indicator 1)
was met each semester throughout implementation. Excluding the EEPs for the period
prior to effectiveness, the second global indicator (executing at least 70 percent of the
EEP budget) was met only once by two sectors (health and transport). Education never
met this target. There were three annual measurements of all PDIs (including
Disbursement-linked Indicators - DLIs) (2009, 2010 and 2011) and an additional
measurement for 2012 was available for all, except some education indicators that are
based on the education census only published in May for the previous year. The number
of DLIs achieved per year (2009-2011) out of a total of 11 (excluding global indicators),
was five, three, and three, respectively. Regarding the other PDIs, this excluding an
indicator on hospitalization for diabetes mellitus with unreliable data (see M&E section),
the number of other PDIs met, out of a total of 14, was two, two and two, respectively,
for the three years. Thus, after the first year when a total of seven out of 25 indicators
were met (28%), achievement of targets declined to 20 percent in 2011.

Component 1: Strengthening Results-Based Management (RBM) in the Public
Sector

2.      Component 1 sought to institutionalize RBM in public administration overall,
and more directly by supporting critical public sector management reforms in
education, health and transport sectors. The component was structured as a Sector
Wide Approach (SWAp), financing a percentage of the selected programs (EEPs) in the
three sectors. To receive their full disbursement, sectors had to execute 70 percent of
budgeted EEPs and comply with all their DLIs. Other than in 2009 when EEP
expenditures reported included retroactive expenditures (in the disbursement that was
effected), education never reached the 70 percent and health and transport only reached it
once. Moreover, a total of seven PDIs met their targets on the first year and only five
thereafter. This included only three of 11 DLIs.

3.      Public sector management and accountability were to be strengthened by
expanding RBM practices and improving fiduciary oversight. The latter was to be
achieved through training in strategic planning and project management, and M&E,
establishing cost-account systems (for the participating sectors), and strengthening
procurement and financial management all through Component 2. None of the activities
under Component 2 was carried out.

4.     The adoption of RBM, including the signing of annual Results Agreements
(RAs) between the Governor and each of the line secretariats and agencies of the DF,
and the submission of annual reports on performance with respect to agreed targets,
were expected to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of public spending,
and increase accountability in all sectors. The expected outputs for this sector were the
signing of 26 RAs with the various secretariats and Government entities, and the annual


                                           20
evaluation of signed RAs at the end of each year of implementation. The expected 26
RAs were signed by 2011, and an additional seven (new entities) were signed in 2012
covering the new Plano pluri-annual (PPA) for 2012-2015. RAs were signed for a three-
year period, and thus those that signed in 2008 (health) and 2009 (10 others) should have
signed a second agreement in 2012. None of the overdue RAs were renewed. In fact, an
annual report by the Institutional Planning Coordination (Coordenação de Planejamento
Institucional, COPLAN ) notes that in 2012 there were only 20 active RAs.

5.     Progress with regards to the evaluation of RAs was less than expected. By
December 2011, 21 were to have been reviewed. Only 20 had been reviewed in 2012.
The evaluation of RAs was not the subject of supervision missions and thus there is no
information as to whether or not the implementation of RAs, and the manner in which
they have been applied have improved management.

6.      GDF intended to introduce rewards (e.g., additional budget, bonus
payments) for those entities that met or exceeded their performance targets in
health and education. In education, it was linked to the Gestão Compartilhada program
but that program was dropped. In health, it was linked to performance on individual RAs
signed between the health Secretary and health units. However, neither of the incentive
programs was implemented.

7.      In education, it was expected that the expansion of the Gestão Compartilhada
program would improve efficiency, quality and performance. Expanding access to
early child development (ECD) programs and the Escola de Tempo Integral program for
basic education (full-time schools which provide longer and better learning opportunities
that traditional schools) were also expected to improve access to education (reducing
inequity) and improve quality. The focus of these investments was to be low-income
areas and areas with low Basic Education Development Index (Indice de
Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica – IDEB) scores. And programs designed to reduce
age-grade distortion were to improve efficiency of the education system, by moving
students through the system faster, thus reducing costs). However, ECD enrollments
declined over the lifetime of the Project, the full time education program was modified so
by the end no schools were located in low-income areas, the focus of Gestão
Compartilhada was modified and the monitoring instrument was discontinued, and the
programs designed to reduce age grade distortion were also discontinued. The number of
primary schools students with age-grade distortion was supposed to decline from over
92,000 to 17,000 but in fact only declined to about 70,000. Secondary age-grade
distortion declined from 34,805 to 28,556, far above the 3000 expected. These events
contributed to the decrease in secondary school completion rates and the leveling of
primary school completion rates. Overall performance of activities under the State
Secretary of Education (Secretaria de Estado de Educação – SEE) was poor. The SEE’s
new administration, which has rejected the programs developed by the previous
administration that have been well tested-throughout the country, is still in the process of
defining several of its programs.




                                            21
8.      In health, a RA had been signed with the Governor, and subordinate RAs
were signed with health units in January 2008. Improvement in access and quality
focused on the expansion of primary care through the Family Health Program (FHP) was
an integral part of the RA. The expansion of FHP would strengthen prevention and help
resolve health problems before they reached the hospital, thus decreasing patient overload
in hospitals while improving service quality and health outcomes. The latter would also
reflect a more efficient use of health resources. Efficiency would also be improved
through the introduction of a computerized managerial and clinical information system
fed by information contained in patient’s electronic health cards (Cartão de Saúde) and
through the piloting of the subcontracting of the management of the Hospital Sta. Maria
to a non-profit social organization with the purpose of improving hospital management.

9.      In order to expand the FHP, GDF needed to establish more health units and
equip them. Because the project did not finance infrastructure, the program could not
expand. Instead, it planned to use reimbursed funds to then build the needed centers. But,
because each time they did not meet their targets, they received even less funding,
expansion only became more difficult over time. In the last year they did finally procure
equipment for some new centers and thus some expansion will be possible. During the
lifetime of the Project, however, FHP did not expand sufficiently. It was supposed to
reach 40 percent coverage and only reached half as much. Coverage of prenatal care, Pap
smear tests and investigations of infant deaths are all carried out as part of the FHP.
Coverage of prenatal care reached its target, but it had already reached that value at
Project launch. Coverage of Pap smears and investigation of infant deaths did not
increase sufficiently because they are linked to FHP expansion. Coverage of the
population with the Cartão de Saúde surpassed its target. And, while use of the cartão is
an important input to improve efficiency in the sector, improved efficiency itself was not
measured. The other measure of improved efficiency, the subcontracting of management
of the Santa Maria Hospital, was not met because, although the hospital was up and
running under management by a non-profit, the contract was rescinded in 2011. And
finally, the decrease in hospitalization due to diabetes mellitus was incorrectly measured
and cannot be used.

10.     In transport, effectiveness and efficiency of State Secretariat of Transport
(Secretaria de Estado de Transporte – SET) and Federal District Transport
Authority (Departamento de Transporte Urbano do Distrito Federal – DFTRANS)
would be increased through the establishment of a transport Control Center for
Operations (Centro de Controle Operacional –CCO), the preparation of an urban
transport Master Plan, the review and improvement of internal processes, the
modernization of management information systems and equipment, and building
capacity of staff. The Master Plan was to define policy and future investments for
the sector. This was already under preparation when the Project began and was actually
completed and approved by May 2011. The other two key areas of focus in transport
were the establishment of a CCO and of an integrated transport database that would allow
DFTRANS to manage operational and revenue data. Although a law on the new
regulatory framework for public transport services required operators to provide a data
collection and transmission subsystem as part of the automated fare collection system and



                                           22
the automated ticket readers in the buses, bus operators retained control of the ticketing
data. A CCO was to be installed to allow DFTRANS to regain control over the operation
of public transport services and ensure that operators comply with the operational
programs and their other obligations.

11.     The transport sector was one of the most affected by the corruption scandal
as several activities relied on information technology (IT) consultancies, which was
the sector where much of the corruption was found. The CCO was never contracted,
and until end of 2011, they never had the control of the ticketing data. The data, however,
were not available in 2012 as there are delays in submission. Data on the regularity index
also ceased to be available. The regularity index, which compares planned services with
services effectively provided by operators, was calculated using data provided by bus
operators. A private firm was contracted to manage and maintain the transport
information system, but the contract was cancelled after the corruption scandal. Thus, the
data were not available after this. It was expected that by Project end the data would be
derived from the CCO. And, the indicator on complaints, which was based on a database
that registered all complaints, cannot be used as DFTRANS changed the way it handled
complaints, not registering all of them and thus the fall in number of complaints is due to
lower reporting rather than fewer complaints.

12.     Although not under the Project, the transport sector has made some
important advances. A new master plan was developed that incorporates both the CCO
and the fare and ticketing data base under one integrated system. Given the bus company
lobbying, they decided to subcontract bus services by requesting bids for coverage of
specific areas rather than bidding for bus fleets, and employing contracts specifying
quality and coverage parameters. Two out of five contracts have now been signed.

Indicators are shaded when they met the target for the year.

Values for global indicators include those measured in the semester following annual DLI measurement, as
those presented with annual measurements were projections and not actual EEP execution, as the data were
not available until May of each year.
*Data on this indicator are unreliable so they are not included in the assessment of achievement.

Component 2: Building Capacity in the Public Sector

13.     Significant delays in utilizing funds under this component were experienced
due mainly to delays in finalizing a procurement plan. None of the technical
assistance that had been planned under this component was ever contracted. Instead,
several consultancies and training were carried out to strengthen the newly established
State Secretariat of Transparency and Control (SETC). SETC carried out some training
both in Brazil and abroad for its auditors, on auditing techniques, leadership and
management, and attendance to various conferences on corruption, data privacy, and on
internal controls for Government contractors. They carried out a number of individual
consultancies aiming to develop and improve its auditing function and develop policies
with respect to access to information, information security and other areas. It also
assessed IT needs and the improvement of its new transparency portal. They also hired
TA to develop training materials. The State Secretariat of Planning and Budget
(Secretaria de Estado de Planejamento e Orçamento -- SEPLAN) requested them to carry
out an ex-post technical audit of Project data in 2012.

14.     Later, consultancies with numerous other entities were agreed, including
SEDEST, Secretaria de Governo, Defensoría Pública (Public Defense), Health,
DFTRANS and others, for a wide variety of subjects including many which, although
approved, were never carried out for lack of time. Studies included: an assessment of the
quality of asphalt, IT platform design, approaches to social participation observatories,
assessing social participation among subpopulations including youth, nonwhites, lesbians,
gays, transgenders and bisexuals, agrarian reform policies, etc. Some training was
financed for three people from SEPLAN/SES to visit a project in Uruguay. The majority
of studies were carried out in the second half of 2012 and thus insufficient time had
transpired to see if the study results are being utilized. Several studies are not linked to
Project objectives.

                                       Resumo


      Este relat6rio tern por objetivo detalhar o desempenho no ambito do Programa,
tanto do Govemo do Distrito Federal quanto do Banco Mundial, sob a 6tica de li~Oes
aprendidas. atraves dos cumprimentos de suas metas e indicadores bern como dos
aspectos financeiros que tazem parte do acordo, em urn horizonte onde futuras opera~6es
de credito intemacional poderao ser utilizadas em novos projetos.
       A implementa~ao do Programa de Modemiza~ao da Gestao Publica do Distrito
Federal previa a estrutura~ao em dois componentes bilsicos descritos a seguir, que
englobavam a~6es e atividades para a melhoria da presta~ao dos servi~os publicos de
Saude, Educa~ao e Transportes e tambem para a modemiza~ao da gestao publica.
       As a~6es previstas neste Programa foram consubstanciadas no Plano de Govemo
GDF 2007-2010 e aplicadas nos Programas de Despesas Elegiveis inseridas no Plano
Plurianual de 2008 a 2011, e em urn conjunto de atividades de apoio para a modemiza~ao
do modelo de gestao publica do GDF.
Componente 1 - Melhoria da    Presta~o     de Servicros Publicos em Saude, Educacrao e
Transpones.
       Focado nos setores de Saude, de Educa~ao e de Transportes/DFTRANS, por
intennedio do reembolso financeiro ao Tesouro Distrital das despesas realizadas por meio
da execu~ao financeira do Or~amento do GDF, nos programas elegiveis que
possibilitassem o cumprimento das metas setoriais de Govemo.
       0 reembolso financeiro ao Tesouro Distrital estava limitado a 32,5% (trinta e dois
virgula cinco por cento) da execu~ao dos Programas Elegiveis nos tres setores,
condicionados ao cumprimento, por parte do Govemo do Distrito Federal, de metas nas
areas do Programa.
       Alem do desempenho especifico em cada area do Programa, o reembolso
financeiro tambem estaria condicionado a execu~ao de resultados globais como o
cumprimento dos preceitos da Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal, ao superavit primario e a
execu~ao de pelo menos 70% (setenta por cento) do or~amento de cada programa
inserido no projeto.
       Foi preparada uma matriz de compromissos para este Programa, que consistia em
urn agrupamento de despesas elegiveis, acordados com o Banco Munclial, a partir dos
programas prioritarios do Govemo do Distrito rederal, periodo este que antecedia a
assinatura do acordo de emprestimo, o que chamamos de periodo retroativo.
Componente 2- Modernizacrao da Gestao Publica - Assistencia Tecnica .
       Este componente, focado na melhoria da gestao da publica, visava atividades de
desenvolvimento e fortalecimento dos instrumentos de monitoramento e avalia~ao para o
Modelo de Gestao por Resultados, metodo para avalia~ao da melhoria da gestao publica.
As aquisi~6es e desembolso no ambito deste componente deveriam seguir as regras de
licita~ao e desembolso do Banco Mundial e excepcionalmente nao era exigida
contrapartida.
       As principais atividades previstas para este componente contemplava aquisi~6es
de servi~os consultoria individual e de empresas principalmente para a administra~ao
                                                                                                          2

 direta. lnicialmente objetivou-se o desenvolvimento de urn sistema de avalia~ao de custos
 e desempenho e a elabora~ao de rnodelos de monitoramento e avalia~ao dos
 compromissos de resultados.
        o componente visaria tambem aumentar a economia, a eficiencia e a transpan§ncia
do sistema de aquisi~iies do GOoF, alinhando-Q com os padr6es intemacionais por
intermedio do fortalecimento institucional, da modemiza~ae dos processos de aquisi~6es,
da capacita~ae dos tecnicos, no estabelecimento de mecanismos de planejamentos de
aquisi~6es e no gerenciamento de contratos.


lmplementa9ao e aspectos operacionais
      As secretarias setoriais de Saude, Educa~ao. Transportes e DFTRANS forarn
responsaveis pela execu~ae direta das a~6es e atividades de contrapartida e inseridas
neste Programa. Coube as Unidades de Gerenciarnento Local - UGL, de cada secretaria,
infonmar sobre o andamento das atividades e a demonstra~ae dos resultados alcan~ados
junto a Secretaria de Estado de Planejamento e Or~amento quando solicitado pela
Coordena~ao Geral do Programa.
      o acompanhamento do projeto foi realizado pela Unidade de Coordena~ae Geral
do Programa - UCP com base nos cronogramas e indicadores estai:Jelecidos no acordo de
emprestimo. Miss6es de supervisae do Banco Mundial juntamente com a Coordena~ao do
Programa fizeram o acompanhamento das metas pactuadas junto as secretarias
executoras de forma sistematica, com reuni6es ordinarias e extraordinarias confonne a
demanda de cada setor.
      Observa-se, no entanto que pelas caracteristicas multisetoriais deste Programa, e
seus aspectos inovadores aplicados no modelo de gestae do Governo do Oistrito Federal
aumentariam o risco de uma resistencia cultural, tomando-se urn desafio ainda maior na
lase de execu~ae do que o esperado em sua fase de prepara~ae em 2008.
        A crise politica no final de 2009, que acarretou as frequentes mudan~as entre
govemadores, secretaries e equipe t ecnica, afetando o projeto desde a sua lase inicial de
execu~ao em outubro de 2009 ate o momento de encerramento em 2012, prejudicando
significativamente a execu~ao de todas as atividades previstas na fase de prepara~ao do
programa.
        o Programa de Mooemiza~ao da Gestae Publica do Oistrito Federal teve uma
oportunidade de reestrutura~ao. confonne ja era prevista no acord:o de emprestimo, mas
isto s6 poderia acontecer ap6s 18 meses de sua abertura, o que ocorreu em abril de
2011. Sendo assim o BIRD juntarnente com a UCP/SEPLAN iniciaram miss6es de revisae
do acordo bern como reuni6es setoriais para revisao dos objetivos, metas e indicadores,
objet ivando inclusive urn novo cronograma fisico e financeiro, prorrogando o Programa
em 18 meses ap6s data prevista de encerrarnento e reaJocando desta forma os recursos
nao reembolsados ate entae.
        Em abril de 2011 foi solicitada pelo Banco Mundial uma minuta da Proposta de
Reestrutura~ao do Programa, os trabalhos junto aos setores envolvidos tiveram inicio no
mesmo mes com a presen~a do BIRD e UCP, sendo conduida e encaminhada ao BIRD
em setembro de 2011. No entanto o BIRD manifestou-se informando que nae havia mais
temi)o habil e em dezembro de 2011 o Banco Mundial encaminhou oficialmente carta ao
Governador solicitando Plano de A~ao para os indicadores nao atingidos e informando
que o Prograrna nao seria prorrogado, permanecendo desta forma a data prevista
inicialmente de 31/12/12 os mesrnos objetivos, estrutura, metas e indicadores.

                                     Programa de Moderniz.a,vio da Gestio PUblica do Oistrito Federal 1 SWAp


      Para a execu~ao deste programa foi elaborado o Manual Operativo do Programa -
MOP, o qual orientava a opera~ao do Programa. Este Manual Operativo foi atualizado e
apelfei~oado, de comum acordo entre o Govemo do Distrito Federal e o Banco MundiaJ,
segundo as necessidades surgidas e li~iies aprendidas ao Iongo da sua implementa~ao.
Assim, foi recomendado que o usuario sempre fizesse consultas a edi~ao mais recente,
que estava sempre disponivel no site da Secretaria de Estado de Planejamento e
Or~amento atraves do portal do Programa (www.programagestaogdf.df.gov.br).


Avaliacrao dos Resultados




        0 Govemo do Distrito Federal passou por grandes reformula~6es no periodo de
vigencia do contrato de emprestimo em tela, as quais provocaram grande instabilidade
politica e administrativa na gestao publica nos exercicios de 2009 e 20 10 . Como advento
do rnovo Govemo do Distrito Federal em 2011, a equipe teve que reformular as
prioridades metas existentes as previstas no novo plano de govemo.
        Com isso, a equipe gestora da Secretaria de Educa~ao foi alterada diversas vezes,
cada qual com os seus direcionamentos e com uma nova estrutura administrativa. Por
isso, tivemos varias composi~6es d'a Unidade de Gerenciamento l ocal, nao possuindo
infonma~6es hist6ricas quanto aos assuntos debatidos em cada reuniao.
        o ideal seria que o contrato em questao tivesse sido reformulado em 2011,
sobretudo no que diz respeito aos indicadores, com metas mais factiveis e que melhor
espeJhassem a nova realidade do DF, contudo nao foi possivel a celebra~ao desse ajuste
de repactua~ao. Portanto, os numeros apresentados aqui, reftetem a tentativa de
monitoramento de indices elaborados por outrem que tinham como objetivos especificos
prioritarios outros que nao os mesmos da atual gestao.
       Dessa forma, destacamos a atua~ao da SEDF em cada a~ao elencada, mesrno
que tenha ocorrido de forma substancialmente diferente do proposto de forma inicial pelo
primeiro comite Gestor do Programa. Ressa~o que a Secretaria de Educa~ao tern agido
pr6-ativamente com vistas a promover a melhoria na modemiza~ao da gestao das
unidades escolares visando sempre· ao alcance de acrescimo sustentavel nos niveis de
qualidade do ensino publico do Distrito Federal.

   i)     Para o indicador de desembolso "Aumento da taxa de atendimento a educa~ao
          infantil de 4 e 5 anos em areas carentes do DF (Fonte: Telematricula).
          lnicialrnente a diminui~ao nas metas de atendimento da Educa~ao 1      nfantil,
          deve-se ao fato da entrada em vigor da Resolu~ao 0 112010 do Conselho de
          Educa~ao do DF que altera a data de corte para 3 1/03, para acesso a Rede
          Publica. A dificuldade encontrada para o aJcance das rnetas se deu por
          au sen cia de unidades escolares que atendem o publico-alvo na rede publica de
          ensino do Distrito FederaL
   ii)    Para o indicador de desembolso "Atendimento de a'lunos com distor~ao

       corr~ao de fluxo com o objetivo de corrigir a distor~ao idade/serie,
       implementando os Ires projetos (Se liga, Acelera e Veredas) atenderam urn
       total de 16.501, segundo dados do Censo Escolar. No entanto, o govemo atual
       avaliou que nao haveria interesse na continuidade dos programas que eram
       executados por entidades privadas.

iii)   Para o indicador de desembolso "Atendimento de alunos com distor~ao
       idade/serie no ensino media em programas de corr~ao de fluxo escolar": Este
                e
       indicador referente a corre~ao de fluxo escolar dos alunos matriculados na 1•
       e 2• series do ensino Media que se encontravam em series nao compativeis
       com a idade, em decorrencias de multiples fatores, tais como: reprova~ao
       escolar, evasao, ingresso tardio na escola, etc. Em rela~ao aos estudantes no
       ensino Media com distor~ao idade/serie, segundo dados do censo escolar de
       2010, registrou-se um total de 24.017 nessa condi~ao em 2010.
iv}    Para o indicador de desembolso "Numero de escolas com educa~ao integral
       em areas prioritarias do DF.": Em 2009, 201o e 2011 nao houve nenhuma
       escola que desenvolveu, por compl eto, ou seja, minima de 07 (sete) horas de
       atendimento diario, em todos os dias da semana, com atendimento a todos os
       alunos na perspectiva da Educa~ao Integral, dentro das areas prioritarias.
       As escolas com educa~ao integral atendidas naquele periodo, segundo dados
       do EDUCACENSO, nao estao locaJizadas nas areas prioritarias, conforrne
       prescrito no indicador correspondente, sendo estas escolas localizadas nas
       demais regi6es do Distrito Federal, sendo atendidas 04 (quatro) escolas em
       2009, 01 (uma) escola em 2010, 01 (uma) escola em 2011 e 02 (duas) escolas
       em 2012.
       Cabe ainda ressaltar que a Educa~ao Integral no Distrito Federal iniciou-se em
       2007 com a cria~ao da Secretaria de Estado Extraordinaria para a Educa~ao
       Integral - Decreta n• 28.503, de 0411212007, extinta em 2010 com a cria~ao da

lndicadores de Monitoramento:

     i)       Para o indicador de monitoramento "Aumentar as taxas de promo~ao do ensino
              fundamental (1° ao go ano)": Em 2011 foi alcan~ada a taxa de prom~ao com a
              mectia de aprova~ao do Ensino Fundamental de 84,79%. Contudo, a atual
              administra~ao da Secretaria de Estado de Educa~ao, identificando que as metas
              estipuladas eram timidas para os objetivos do Govemo do Oistrito Federal, esta
              implementando os Cidos de Aprendizagem na rede publica de ensino, com
              vistas a propiciar a aprendizagem dos alunos minimizando, ainda mais, os
              percentuais de reprova~ao escolar.
     ii)      Para o indicador de monitoramento "MelhOrar a taxa de promo~ao do ensino
              Mectio.· Em 2011 a taxa de prorno~ao dos alunos do ensino Medio foi de
              66,17%, segundo dados do Censo. As causas para o nao atingimento da meta
              estipulada nao foram identificadas tempestivamente·. contudo a atual
              administra~ao da Secretaria de Educa~ao, obseJVando os baixos resultados
              alcan~ados no periodo avaliado, detenminou a implementa~ao para exercicio de
              2013 da Semestralidade do Ensino Mectio, com vistas a oportunizar a aprova~ao
              escolar e redu~ao dos indices de evasao.
     iii)     Para o indicador de monitoramento "Melhorar o lOEB de 125 escolas
              selecionadas com mais baixo lOEB localizadas em RA's mais carentes. (Anexo
              IV)": A partir da media da Prova Brasil 2007 e 2009, verifica-se que as escolas
              que atendem o Ensino Fundamental Regular - Series lniciais - 4" serie,
              atingiram um percentual de 98% de melhoria nas taxas do lOEB. Em rela~ao ao
              ensino Fundamental Regula r - series finais: 5" e s• serie a varia~ao encontrada
              foi de 96,5% daquelas que alcan~aram melhorias no lOEB.
     iv)      Para o indicador "Aumentar a eficiencia de estrategias de gestao nas escolas": o
              indicador foi instituido sob a vigencia da Lei 4.036, de 25 de outubro de 2007, e
              executada por meio do Programa de Trabalho destinado a execu~ao da
              descentraliza~ao da administra~ao financeira das escola (POAF}. Contudo, no
              decorrer do exercicio de 2011, foram realizadas plenarias com a comunidade
              escolar que culminaram com a realiza~ao da confen§ncia da Gestao
              Oemocratica da Educa~ao. Oiante desse marco, aprovou-se a Lei n• 4.751, de
              sete de fevereiro de 2012 que revogou a norma anterior e estabeleceu a gestao
              democratica na rede publica de ensino do Oistrito Federal.

       incompletas, nao consideradas no calculo. Registra-se tam!Jem, a impossibilidade
       de implanta~ao. aquisi~ao ou aluguel de im6vel para abriga-las. Alem do baixo
       or~amento govemamental para edifica~ao, tambem nao foi possivel a utiliza~ao de
       recursos do BIRD para esse fim.
ii)    Prooorcao de 6bitos intantis i nvestigados     o
                                                     nao alcance de:sta meta deveu-se em
       grande parte ao contexto politico vivenciado uma vez que a estrutura~ao de
       comiss6es/comites e levada a efeito a partir da nomea~ao , para a ocupa~ao de
       diversos cargos nas Regionais de Saude. Desta maneira nao e realista esperar que
       atividades que dependam de estrutura atinjam um nivel adequado de
       funcionamento no primeiro ano de um govemo, ap6s uma fase prolongada de
       desestrutura~ao. Porem, observa-se a recupera~ao expressiva ocorrida em 2011,
       embora fosse esperado que algum tempo decorresse antes que as comiss6es
       estivessem totalmente fomnadas e adaptadas as novas chef.as e orienta~6es
       tecnicas.
iii)   Razao entre exames citopato1    6gicos cervico-vaginais em mulheres entre 25 e 59
       anos: o motivo principal para o nao atingimento desta meta foi a desistencia da
       SES na aquisicao dos insumos necessaries a realizacao desses exames pela area
       responsavel na SEPLAN. Tall deficiencia foi superada em 2012 em decorrencia da
       estrutura~ao da Central de Compras da SES em 2011 e do mapeamento e
       remodelagem de processes, em curso.

Transpone:

      Ap6s a posse do novo govem o em 2011 foram tomadas decis6es de alto nivel no
Setor Transporte que trouxeram novos fatores a serem considerados no desenvolvimento
das a~6es em Transportes, dentre e'las:

i)     Homologa~ao      do Plano d iretor de Transportes Urbanos, que pemnitiu a
       estrutura~ao de diversas a~iies em transportes de maneira prevista em lei;
ii)    Remodelagem do Sistema de Transportes Urbanos, com lan~amento de edital para
       novos contratos de opera~ao· do sistema de 6nibus de Distriito Federal e defini~ao
       de mudan~a do modelo de opera~ao. Este novo modelo mudou a contrata~ao de
       operadores de contrato por frota por bacias geograficas, integra~ao tarifaria e
       aberta mediante cart6es de transportes, concess6es por menor tarifa alem de
       diversas outras regras de opera~ao;
iii)   Constru~ao de corredores especiais de 6nibus, com destaque para Expresso OF,
       que liga a regiao sui do Distrito Federal a sua area central. Este corredor optou pela
       tecnologia operacionaJ BRT (Bus Rapid Transit), que envolve tecnologias
       veiculares especiais, infraestrutura de apoio diferenciada e sistemas de tecnologia
       como Centro de Controle Operacional;
iv)    lmplanta~ao nao apenas de um Centro de Controle Operaci'onal para a gestao do
       sistema, mas de todo um ambiente de Sistema lnteligente em Transportes
       (Intelligent Transport System - ITS), que e um ambiente mais amplo onde o Centro
       de Controle Operacional e apenas uma das grandes tecnologias envolvidas.

       Com   rela~ao  aos indicadores de gestao cabe informar que a Subsecretaria de
Modemiza~ao da Gestao - SUMOG, unidade administrativa vinculada a SEPLAN, ficou
responsavel pelos trabalhos relacionados aos Termos de Compromisso. num total de 33
ao Iongo dos ultimos anos, e principalmente por meio do Planejamento Estrategico
lnstitucional (PEl) nao previsto inicialmente no Programa.
       Os trabalhos sao direcionados obedecendo as premissas e estrategias definidas
pelo Plano Estrategico do Governo do Distrito Federal, conduido em agosto de 2011, com
o apoio da Escola Nacional de Administra~ao Publica (Enap) e alinhados ao Plano
Plurianual (PPA), Cicio 2012-2015.
      Alem do Plano Estrategico do Govemo. os PEls sao desenvolvidos em
conformidade como Plano Plurianual (PPA), Cido 2012-2015, mais especificamente em
atendimento ao Programa Tematico do Governo n•. 6203 - Apertei~oamento lnstitucional

entre a Secretaria de Estado de Transportee a DFTRANS.


Licroes Aprendidas


        Primeiramente o Govemo do Distrito Federal reconhece a oportunidade de poder
absorver o conhecimento tecnico e ao mesmo tempo aperfei~oar o seu quadro funcional,
com esta experiencia com crec!rto extemo, na busca de uma melhor gestao. Certamente
todos que fizeram parte deste projeto contribuiram com esfor~o e dedica~ao, seja do GDF
ou BIRD.
        Como li~ao aprendida observa-se que teria sido apropriado inserir na estrutura <Ia
coordena~ao do Programa nao apenas consultores especialistas em aquisi~iies
intemacionais ou financeiros, mas tambem urn comite pennanente de aquisi~iies. fonnado
por servidores de carreira com eY.periencia em aquisi~iies, alem de uma assessoria
juridica, certamente o projeto teria maior agilidade nas compras govemamentais.
        Percebe-se tambem que mesmo que nao houvesse a crise politica que provocou o
enfraquecimento politico do Programa, poderia ter sido observado na sua lase de
prepara~ao as seguintes incoerencias que prejudicaram a lase de execu~ao:
   • o    DFTRANS possuia uma area de compras propria e nao podia realizar suas
       compras pela Central de Compras. a nao ser que o BIRD homologasse a area de
       compras, somente foi submetido em 2011 pelo BIRD a DFTRANS urn questionano
       para validar a capacidade de compra <Ia DFTRANS. eo mesmo nao aprovou.
   •   De acordo com as Diretrizes de aquisi~iies do BIRD todas as compras atraves de
       pregao eletronico deveriam ser feitas pelo sistema de compras eletronicas do
       govemo federal COMPRASNET, e a Central de Compras desde o inicio ate quase
       seu encerramento em 2012 nao possuia tecnologia, pessoal quaJificado e
       autoriza~ao para realizar compras virtuais pelo COMPRASNET.

   •   0 setor saude teve grande dificuldade em encaminhar suas aquisi~iies no inicio da
       l ase de execu~ao. pois o BIRD exigia revisao previa de grandes compras e a forma
       de agrupar os rtens a serem adquiridos era conftrtante com a forma de trabalho do
       setor saude. Somente no uJ:imo ano do programa foi homologado um setor de
       compras da saUde pelo BIRD para que o setor pudesse realizar suas aquisi~iies
       com as regras do Bl RD. porem nao havia mais tempo suficiente para realiza~ao,
       nao foram encaminhados processos de compras para Central de Compras, pois os
       terrnos de reterencia (TORs) nao haviam sido aprovados pelo BIRD.
   •   o setor educa~ao nao poderia realizar compras com as regras do BIRD dentro dos
       Programas de Despesas Elegiveis, pois o setor ja havia realizado compras dentro
       dos Programas de Despesas Elegiveis antes da assinatura do acordo de
       emprestimo, neste periodo que antecedeu a assinatura do acordo nao foi exigido o
       cumprimento das diretrizes. Sendo assim s6 foram apresentadas despesas nao
       licitaveis, porem elegiveis, como descentraliza~ao e transferencia de recursos
       previstos no Programa de DescentraJiza~ao Administrativa e Financeira - PDAF.
      o prazo para execu~ao de murtas das aquisi~iies do Componente 2 tomou-se
exiguo devido ao desembolso ter sido efetuado em abril de 2011, neste periodo foi
necessario uma revisao de todo o plano de aquisi~iies para este componente, tomando

                                                                                                          9

infactivel a realiza~ao do que foi planejado para ser executad o em 36 meses restando
apenas 18 meses de Programa.
       A falta de experiencia dos servidores em atuar em parceria com organismos
financeiros intemacionais aumentou o risco operacional. Observa-se entao que a
experiencia adquirida pela equipe do Programa e urn divisor de aguas no GDF, apesar da
alta rotatividade, alguns servidores pennaneceram no Programa e tiveram a oportunidade
de conhecer o metodo de trabalho do BIRD, desenvolveram a autocritica e a busca da
melhoria dos processos. Certamente poderia existir uma a~ao de capacita~ao permanente
de servidores envolvidos com este tipo de projeto, o que muito facilitaria a opera~ao de
projetos de opera~ao de credito intemacional.
        Sugere-se para projetos futuros que na lista de riscos, constem mecanismos que
garantam a continuidade das a~5es acordadas, mesmo em cenarios com mudan~as
politicas, como ocorreu no OF, ou na transi~ao de govemos.
        Observa-se, por exemplo, que a rotatividade de pessoal fez com que tanto o BIRD
quanto a Coordena~ao do Programa mantivessem atualizados todos os setores sobre as
caractenisticas e desafios propostos. No entanto nem sempre foi possivel o acesso e a
dissemina~ao da infonna~ao em todos os niveis operacionais por falta de mecanismos de
integra~ao. de fonna sistemica e automatizada, onde os participantes pudessem atuaJizar
os dados coletados e alimentar os indicadores em tempo real.
        0 Programa continha muitas regras, projetos de aquisi~6es, metas e indicadores,
para tanto seria oportuno que fosse utilizada uma ferramenta informatizada para unificar a
documenta~ao do Projeto ou ate mesmo controlar o cronograma de forma unificada de
todas as atividades do projeto, com seus prazos e responsaveis_
       Para projetos futuros seria importante enfatizar a necessidade de capacita~ao de
pessoas, envolvidas direta ou indiretarnente no Programa, seja atraves de cursos
oferecidos pelo pr6prio GDF ou pelo BIRD. No caso deste ultimo foram feitas solicita~6es
de amplia~ao da participa~ao do GDF em cursos de gerenciamento financeiro e licita~iies
intemacionais oferecidos pelo BIRD, apenas 2 vagas por semestre nao foram suficientes
para atender a demanda, talvez a realiza~ao de uma tunna fecllada para multiplicadores
poderia ter gerado urn melhor resultado.
        Com rela~ao aos indicadores, muito se questionou sobre a qualidade dos
indicado res de desempenho deste Program a, para projetos 1iuturos sugere-se que se
utilize por base as orienta~6es do Tribunal de Contas da Uniao, conforrne Boletim
especial publicado em 11 de Janeiro de 20 11 no Diano Oficial da Uniao.
      Por fim conclui-se a importancia do papel do Banco Mundial, nao apenas como
entidade financeira, mas como organismo intemacional com capacidade tecnica e
gerencial para atuar em Programas de grande porte, como est:e, onde cada especialista
do BIRD pode deixar a sua contribui~ao e opiniao sobre os caminhos desenvolvidos e
implementados.

                                        Summary

       The objective of this report is to detail the pertonnance of the Federal District
Government and the WMd Bank Within the Program under the perspective of the lessons
learned through the compliance with the goals and indicators. as well as from the financial
aspects that are part of the agreement, so the future international loan operations can be
used in the new projects.

      The implement ation of the ModerniZation of the Public Administration Program by
the Federal Distlict of Brazil (OF) foresaw a structure of two basic components described
below. that included actions and activities that improve public services in the areas of
Health. Education, Transportation and the Public Administration.

       These foreseen actions were consubstantiated in the Government Plan of the year
2007 -2010 and applied in the Eligible Expenditures Programs. Which are included in lhe
Multiannual Plan of the 2008 - 20 11 alongside With a group of support activities for the
modernization ofthe public management model.

Component 1 - Im provement in the public services in the areas of Health, Education
and Transponati on.

        This component focuses on Health, Education and Transportation/DFTRANS
Sectors through financial reimbursement of the incurred expenditures that are in the
execution of the government budget to the Treaswy of OF and in the eligible programs
that allow the achievement of the sectorial goals in the government.

       The financial reimbursement to the Treasury of OF was limited to 32.5% (thirty-two
point five per cent) of the execution of the Eligible Programs in these three sectcrs,
conditioned upon the achievement of goals by the Federal District government in the areas
of the program.

        In addition to the specific performance in eaCh area of the program. the financial
reimbursement also is conditioned upon the execution of the global results such as the
compliance with principles of the Fiscal Responsibility Law. the primary surplus and the
execution of at least 70% (seventy per cent) of the budget of each program within the
proj ect.

      An array of commitments was prepared for this Program Which consisted of a
grouping of eligible expenses, as agreed With the World Bank, from the major prioli1ies
programs of the Federal District Government, a peliod that preceded the signature of the
loan agreement, Which we called retroactive period.

Component 2- Modernizati on of the Public Administration- Technical Assist ance

        This component was focused in the improvement of the public administration aimed
to the development of activities and strengthening of monitoring and assessment tools F or
the l'vlodel of Management by Results Which is a method that evaluates the improvement
of the public administration. The acquisitions and d isbursements in this component should
follow the Wo~d Bank rules of bidding and disbursements and exceptionally a counterpart
was not required.



                                                                                                             2

        The main actiVities foreseen in these components were the acquisitions of individual
and corporate consulting services plimalily to be used in the Direct Public Administration.
Initially, it aimed to develop the evaluation system for costs and performance and, also, to
the preparation of monitoling and assessments models for the commitments results.

       1he component wou1    a also a1 m to 1   ncrease me economy, emc1     ency ana
transparency of the procurement system of the Federal Distlict Government, aligning it
with international standards through institutional strengthening, modernization of the
procurement process, training of the technicians, for establishing mecnanisms fer
planning procurement and contracts management.

Implementation and operational aspects

        The secretariats of Health, Education, Transportation and DFTRANS were directly
responsible for the execution of governmental actions and actiVities and they were also
inserted in this program. Eacn Secretariat had its own Local Management Unit - UGL.
They were responsible to inform to the Secretariat of Planning and Budget all the ongoing
activities and also to demonstrate all the results that were accomplished wnenever
requested by the Head of the General Coordination of the Program.

      The project monitoring was conducted by the Head of the Program General-
Coordination Unit - UCP based on timelines and indicators set out in the loan agreemen:.
The supervising missions of the World Bank alongside with the General Coordination cf
the Program systematically monitored the goals consistently established with executor
secretaliats, through ordinary and extraordinary meetings, as demanded from eacn
sector.

       It is noted, however, that the characteristics of this muHi-sector program and its
innovative aspects applied on the management of the Public administration of the Federal
District Government would increase the risks of cultural resistance, Which becomes an
even greater challenge during the execution phase rather than expected in its preparation
phase in 2008.

       The political crisis in the end of 2009 led to frequent changes among several high
level positions in the government (governors, secretaries and teChnical staff} affecting thi5
project since its initial execution phase in October 2009 until the conclusion in 20 12 . This
occurrence caused a significantly impairment in the performance of all activities planned
during the preparation phase of the program.

       The Program for Public Management Modernization of the DF had an opportunity to
restructure itself, as it was already predicted in the Iron agreement, but that could happen
only after 18 months after its opening, Which occurred in April 20 11. Therefore, the IBRD
along with UCP/SEPLAN began the reviewing missions in the loan agreement as well as
sectolial meetings in order to reestablish objectives, goals and indicators. Besides that, a
new physical and financial timetable would be induded, extending the program in 18
months after the dosing date and reallocating the funds not yet reimbursed by then.

       In April 2011 the Wo~d Bank requested a draft of the Program Restructuring
Proposal. The tasks involving all the sectors of the program also began in April, 2011 With
the presence of IBRD and the UCP being completed and forwarded to the Wo~ d Bank in
September 20 11. However IBRD manifested that there wouldn't be enough time left, so in
December of 20 11 the Wo~d Bank sent an official letter to our governor asking for an
                                                                                                             3

Action Plan for the indicators that had not been achieved. In addition to that, this Jetter
infonned to the Governor that this program would not be extended, then the date of
December 3 1" 2012 that had been originally agreed would be maintained With the same
goals, structure, targets and indicators.

       An Operational Manual of this Program - MOP Which guided the program's
operation, was produced so that this program could be executed. This Operating
I landbook has been updated and improved by an agreement between the Government of
the OF and the World Bank, according to the needs that emerged and the lessons learned
during its implementation. Thus, it was recommended that the users always Checked the
latest edition, Which was always available on the website of the Secretariat of Planning
and Budget or in our website (www.programagest aogdf.df.gov.br).

Evaluation of the Results

Ed ucation:

       The Federal District of Brazil has gone through major reformulations in the period of
     oan contract, Which caused enormous management and political instability in the
this J
public administration during the years of 2009 and 2010 . As the new Federal District
Government arrived in 2011, the team had to redesign the existing priorities according to
the new government plan.

      For this reason, the management team of the Department of Education had been
modified for several times making each of them to have different viewpoints and bringing
new administrative structure. In this sense. we had several Local Management Unit
changes, but we don't have all the meeting records that were discussed previously.

        The contract would be ideal if it was reformulated in 2011, especially regarding the
ind icators with more feasible goals that appropriately demonstrate the reality of the
Federal District of BraZil. However, it was not possible to conclude this adj ustment
negotiation. Therefore, the numbers that are presented here reftect the attempt of
monitoring indexes that were elaborated by those WhO had other relevant specific
objectives Which were different from those of the current administration.

       Thus, we highlight the performance of the Secretariat of Education listed in every
action, even if it had been substantially different from the original proposal by the first
Management Committee of the program. I emphasiZe that this Secretariat had worked
proactively in order to encourage the improvements in the modernization of the
management in school units that are always aiming to reaCh sustainaiJie growth in quality
levels of public education in the OF.

Initially the decrease in service goals of the preschool was due to the fact that the new
Resolution 0 1/2010, IAllieh was established by the Board of Education of the Federal
District, had entered into force and Which modified the cutoff date to march 3 1" for children
access in the Public Education. The difficulty faced to accomplish these goals was due to
the J ack of school units that served the target-audience in the public schools of the OF.

        ii) Dis bursement indicator "Decrease in the number of students w ith overage
distortion rate in basic education (grades 1 to 9)" In 2009, the Secretariat of Education had
maintained the program of the now correction in order to correct the overage d istortion by
implementing three projects ( Se /iga, Ace/era e Veredas) Which served an amount of
16.50 1 Children, according to the Education Census. However, the current government
conduded that there would be no interested to continue those programs that had been
executed by the private entities.

         iii) Disbursement indicator "Decrease the number of students w ith overage
distortion rate in the Secondal)' Education· . This indicator refers to the correction of the
education now of the children enrolled in the 1" and 2"" grade of the Secondal)' School
that were not in their correspondent age-grade, due to multiples reasons, such as: school
failure, dropout, late admission in the schOol, etc . Regarding high school students with
overage distortion rate, it was registered a total of 24.0 17 students in this condition in
2010, according to the Education Census in the same year.

        iv) Disbursement indicator "Number of schools with full-time program education in
low-income areas of the OF": In lhe years of 2009, 20 10 and 2011 no school had
completely developed (a minimum of 7 hours daily during the days of week) the
perspective of the full-time attendance within the low-income areas. The full-time sChools
that should develop a full-time attendance during those years were not located in the
priority areas, as mentioned in the EDUCACENSO and as determined in its correspondent
ind icators. These schools were located in other regions of the OF, w ith 4 (four) schools
served in 2009, 0 1 (one) served in 2010 and 20 11 and 02 (two) schools served in 20 12.

       It is important to mention that the full-time education programs in the OF started in
2007 with the establishment of the extraordinal)' Secretariat of Integral Education by the
Governor Act n• 28.503 , on December 4'•. 2007. A few years later, by the Governor Act n•
3 1.613 of the April 23"' 2010, this Secretariat was turned to an Under secretariat of
Integral Education, Citizenship and Human Rights. In December 12"', 20 11, this Under
secretariat was extinguished and a Coordination of Integral Education, Which is directly
linked to the Undersecretariat of Basic Education, was created.

        Under this new government arrangement, it was possible to prepare the planning
for the period from 2012 to 20 14. After the registration had been completed in
Educacenso, in 20 12, 03 full-time kindergarten centers were opened (01 in Sao Sebastiao,
0 1 in Brazlandia and 0 1 in Estrutural). These new education centers had served a total of
the students for the period of 07 hours daily. For the year of 2013 , we've had an increase
of over 22 schOol units offering full-time education for the period of 10 hours daily to all the

Monito ring Ind ic at ors:

                                      t ement of the completion rate in Basic Education (1st
       i) Monitoring indicator " lmpro•
to 9th grade)": In 20 11 the completion rate was achieved w ith the average of approval in
the basic education of 84.79%. However, the current administration of the Secretariat of
Education is implementing learning cycles in public sChools, by conduding that the defined
goals were vel)' timid for the goals of the Federal District Government. These cirdes
intend to minimize, even more, the percentage of failure in the school.


                                                                                                                  5

       ii) Monitoring indicator "Improvement of the completion rate in the Secondary
Education." In 2011 the completion rate of Secondary Education students was 66.17%,
according to the data Census. The reasons for not accomplishing the goals as planned
were not identified on time. However, the current administration of the Secretariat of
Education, after observing the poor results, determined in 20 13 the implementation of a
semester term in the Secondary Education in order to maximize the school approval rate
and to reduce the dropouts.

       iii) Monitoring indicator "Improvement of Basic Education Development Index -
lOEB in 125 selected schools located in poor urban areas (Annex IV)." Based upon the
average of Prova Brasil 2007 and 2009, it was observed that the schOols that served the
regular primary education - beginning at 4"' grade - reached a percentage of 98% of
improvement in the lOEB index. Regard ing regular prtmary sChools - from 51!1 to grade -         •
                                                                                                s•
the variation founded was of 96.5% of thOse Who achieved improvements in lOEB.

       iv) Monitortng indicator "Increase in the efficiency of school management strategies,
as measured by selected indicators." The ind icatcr was imposed by Law n• 4036 of
October 25"'. 2007 and executed through the Program focus on the implementation of the
sChool financial manaQement decentralization (PDAF). However, durinQ the year of 20 11,
there were plenary sessions with the presence of the school community that culminated
with the Democratic Management Education conference. In this context, the Law No.
4751. of Febnual'f Jlli, 2012 was approved and revoked previous rule and established the
democratic management in the Public Education Syslem in the OF.

Health:
        i) Population Covered by the Family Health Program: The concept of "Population
Covered" used by the Ministry of Health only recognizes completed teams, with an staff
covered by the regulations about this subj ect, including as regards to the quantity of ea ch
category. In recent years, the Secretariat of Health has found a number of difficulties in
recruiting and maintaining staff in some locations. resulting in a significant percentage of
the population covered by uncompleted teams that was not considered in the calculation.
Also. it is important to register the impossibility of deployment, acquisition or rent of the
lluilnings IM I wouln rP.c:P.iVP. thP.m In Mnition. thP. low govP.mmP.ntal llun(JP.I frr
construction. it was also not possible to use IBRD funds for this purpose.

       ii) Prooortion of investigated infant deaths: The failure to rea ch this goal was largely
due to the political context experienced in the government, because the composition of the
commissions/committees to occupy various positions in Regional Health is effective by an
appointment. Thus, it is not realistic to expect that activities relying on this structure can
reach an adequate level of execution in the first year of a government right after getting out
of a prolonged phase of disintegration. However. there was a significant recovery occurred
in 2011. even though it was expected that some period of time was passed before
commissions had been fully formed and its adapted to the new leadership and technical
guidance.

       iii) Ratio of the cervicovaginal cytology tests i1 women between 25 and 59 years:
The main reason for not achieving this goal was the waiver of the Secretariat of Health in
the acquisition of inputs needed for suCh tests in the procurement area responsible by the
Secretariat of Planning and Budget. This deficiency was overcome in 2012 due to the n~ew
structuring of the procurement sector of Secretariat of Health in 2011 and to the ongoing
mapping and remodeling processes.

                                                                                                            6

Transponation:
      After the inauguration of the new government in 2011, several decisions in the high -
level of the Transportation Sector were made. Because of that, new issues were
considered during the development of actions in transportation, such as:

       i) Ratification of the Urban Transportation Master Plan. Which allowed the
structuring of various actions in transportation as provided by law;

       ii) Remodeling Urban Transportation System by publishing the bidding rules for the
new operational contracts for the bus system of the OF and its definition of the operational
model shift. This new model has exChanged the operator's admissions 1Jf fteet contract by
geographic basins, opened and integrative fare by transport cards, low-rate concessions
as well as several other rules of operation;

      iii) Construction of special bus lanes, especially in the OF Express, that connects
the southern region of the OF to it s central area. The technology selected for the
passageway used the BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) operational teChnology, Which involves
special vehicle technologies, differentiated supporting infrastructure and technOlogy
systems as an Operational Control Cent er;

         iv) lmplementati:>n of not only an Operational Control Center for managing the
system, but an entire and completed Intelligent Transportation System (ITS - Intelligent
Transport System), Which is a much broader system Where the Operational Control Center
is j ust one of the maj or technologies involved.

     v) TakinQ over the control of Automatic TicketinQ System (SBA). with complete SBA
management transfer to the OFTRANS.

   Management Indicators :

       Regarding the management ind icators it is important to inform that the Under
secretariat for Modernization of the Management - SUMOG, WhiCh is an administrative untt
subordinated to the Secretariat of Planning and Budget, was responsible for the Tenns of
Commitment. It summed up a total of 33 over the past few years, and especially through
the strategic lnstiM ional Planning (PEl) that was not foreseen in the originally program.

       The tasks are oriented to obey the premises and strategies set by the Government
Strategic Plan of the OF that was concluded, in August 20 11, w ith the support of the
National SChool of Public Administration (ENAP) as well as its alignment to the Multiyear
Plan (PPA) 2012-2015.

       In addition to the Government Strat egic Plan, the PE ls are developed in accordance
w ith the Multiyear Plan (PPA) 2012-2015, more specifically in compliance with the
Government Thematic Program no. 6203 - state lnstiM ional Improvement predicted in
the Multiyear Plan (PPA), 2012 -2015.

   Proposal for continuity of actions foreseen in the Management Program GDF

Educatio n Sector

       The Education Sector remains working to develop actions that will lead to aChieVing
their goals. Some of the corrections, the methods Changes and procedures are performed
in order to better serve the realization of these actions.

Healt h Sector:

       The health sector remains performing a ctions focused in the objectives that were
settled in the Management Program GDF. All the settled goals are in the agenda of the
nationwide Health System, as a State policy Where the OF has to follow. Thus, the
expansion of population coverage by the Family Health Strategy, along with the
computerization of all network services and the administrative processes, and the search
for identification and incorporation of new management tools are continuing to be among
the strategic goals of the Secretariat of Health for the period from 2012 to 2015.

Transponati on Sector/DFTRANS:

        After overcoming domestic deficiencies caused by agreement cancellations, poor
access into critical data to control bus fteets, and other internal difficulties faced, the
Transportation Sector/DFTRANS is developing a ctions that will enable the achievements
of the goals that were agreed in the Program Which are induded in the government
Programs. For this reason, meetings have been held in order to avoid duplicate expenses
and to better optimize the activities that should be implemented and that depend on
definitions between the Secretariat of Transportation and DFTRANS.

Lessons Learned

       Firstly, the Federal District Government recognizes the opportunity to assimilate the
technical knoWledge and at the same time to improve its workforce With this experience
regard ing foreign cred~ loans, in order to pursue better governmental management. Surely
everyone, either from the GDF or the IBRO. Who participated in this project, made a big
contribution with great effort and dedication.

       As lessons learned, we observed that it would have been very valuable to have into
the structure of the coordination program, specialist consultants With not only international
acquisitions or financial KnOWledge, but also a permanent procurement committee With
pemnanent public servants With experience in a cquisitions, besides a legal advisory office.
In this sense certainly the program would have much more quickness in government
acquisitions.

      Also it was noticed that even if there was no pol~ical crisis weakening the program,
some of the following inconsistencies that hampered the implementation stage could have
been observed during its preparation :

    • The DFTRANS has its own procurement department and could not make purchases
throughOut the Central Procurement Sector of the government, unless 1BRD if it has been
approved. Onty in 2011 the 1BRD submitted to DFTRANS one questionnaire to validate the
capacity of DFTRANS to purchase their goods Which was denied .

                                                                                                            8


                                                 48
                                       Programa de Moderniz.a,vio da Gestio PUblica do Oistrito Fedeul 1 SWAp


    • According to the IBRD Procurement Guidelines, all of the acquis~ions conducted
througlh the electronic bidding system shoulcl be done through the federal electronic
purchase system called ComprasNet. Since the beginning of the program until its dosure
in 2012 , the Central Procurement Sector of the Federal District Government did not have
technology, qualified personnel and authorization by the ComprasNet system to make its
purchases electronically.
    • The health sector had great difficulty forwarding their acquisitions at the beginning
of the execution pnase, because the IBRD nad demanded a prior revision on the major
acquisitions. Besides that the way of grouping the items that would be purchased was
confticiting with the way of worKing within the health sector. Only in the last year of the
program, the IBRD approved a procurement sector for the Health, in order to comply wit h
the IBRD procurement rules. However, there was not enough time to perform the bidding
processes, so the Central Procurement Office was not sent due to the Terms of Reference
(TORs) had not been approved by IBRO.
    • The education sector could not purcnase according to the 1BRD rules within the
Eligible Expenditure Programs, because, before signing the loan agreement, the sector
had already made purchases Within the Eligib'le Expenditure Programs. The peliod that
preceded the agreement signature didn1 require the compliance with guidelines.
Therefore, only the non-biddable, but eligible, expenditures as decentralization and
transfer of resources mentioned in the Financial and Administrative Decentralization
Program - PDAF were presented.

       The execution deadline for many acquisit ions from Component 2 became short due
to the disbursement that was made in Aplil 201 1. At this time it was necessary to review
the entire procurement plan for this component. In consequence of that, it became
unfeasible the accomplishment of the execution in 36 months as planned, in the remaining
18 months of the Program.

       The lack of expelience of the public servants working With the international financial
organizations increased the operational lisK   . It can be observed that the experience gained
by the staff of the Program is a landmark in the GDF. Despite the high turnover number,
some public servants stick With the program and have had the opportunity to meet the
IBRD working method. Also, they have developed their self-cliticism and the pursuit on the
improvement of the processes. Undoubtedly, there could be permanent training actions for
the public servants involved in this type of project. This would greatly facil~ate the
operabion in projects involving international loans agreement.

       For future projects, it is suggested that the lisk list includes mecnanisms to ensure
the continuity of the agreed actions, even in scenarios with political changes, as occurred
in the OF, or in the government transitions.

       For instance, it is observed that the staff turnover led the IBRD and the Program
Coordination to maintain all sectors updated on the peculialities of the program and its
proposed challenges. However, it was not always possible to access and disseminate the
information in all operational levels due to tne lack of a systematically and automatically
integration mecnanisms, where participants could update the collected data and to feed
the indicators in real time.

      The program contained many rules, acquisition projects, goals and indicators, so it
would be appropliate for it to use a computelized tool to unity the project documentation or
even to control an integrated timetable With all the project activities including its terms and
responsible persons.
                                                                                                           9

         For future projects emphasizing the need for directly or indirectly training for the
personnel involved in the program, either through courses offered by the GDF or by 1                       BRD
would be important. We had requested to IBRD an extension of the numbers of GDF
participants in courses of financial management and international bidding that were offered
by IBRD. We thought only 2 spots per semester were not enough to meet the demand.

       Regarding the indicators, during the program there were many questions about the
qualily of the performance ind icators. For future proj ects it is suggested that we use the
guidelines of the Federal Auditing Court - TCU, a ccording to Special Bulletin published on
January 11"', 2011 in the Official Federal Gazette - DOU.

        Lastly, we condude the important role of the World BanK, not only as a finandal
entity, but also as an international organization With teChnical and managerial capacity to
operate on large programs such as this, Where eaCh IBRD specialist can provide
contributions and opinions about the path to develop and implement the project.
