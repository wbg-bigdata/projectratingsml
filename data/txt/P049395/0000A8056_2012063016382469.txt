                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The initial IDA Credit 3712-ET of the Energy Access Project closed on June 30, 2011. Under this credit, the project rehabilitated and expanded the Addis Ababa distribution system
                         and electrified about 62 villages in Ethiopia. As the planned rehabilitation work in Addis Ababa couldn't complete within the project budget, the Government requested for additional
                         financing to complete distribution network renovation of Addis Ababa, upgrade the distribution network of 7 other major cities, upgrade 19 grid substations and electrify about 50 new
                         villages. These upgrades are expected to increase capacity, reliability and efficiency of the urban electricity network and expand rural access in Ethiopia.

                         The Additional Financing of Energy Access Project was effective in June 2011. Since then EEPCo has selected consultants to review their design and tender documents for the grid
                         substation and distribution network upgrade, and to supervise the works. EEPCo is now in the process of pre-qualifying contractors to issue tender document for the project works.
                         EEPCo has started implementation under the additional financing credit and it is expected that the pace of implementation will soon increase.

                         The Rural Electrification Fund has revised its Project Operational Manual to support the private sector to access funds for their working capital requirements to import and distribute
                         modern lighting products approved by the Lighting Africa Program. In addition REF has installed Solar PV Systems in about 500 primary schools and Health Posts. It has also
                         provided training to village electricians to maintain these PV systems.
