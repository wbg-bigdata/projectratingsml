                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The initial IDA Credit 3712-ET of the Energy Access Project closed on June 30, 2011. Under this credit, the project rehabilitated and expanded the Addis Ababa distribution system
                         and electrified about 62 villages in Ethiopia. As the planned rehabilitation work in Addis Ababa couldn't complete within the project budget, the Government requested additional
                         financing to complete distribution network renovation of Addis Ababa, upgrade the distribution network of 7 other major cities, upgrade 19 grid substations and electrify about 50 new
                         villages. These upgrades are expected to increase capacity, reliability and efficiency of the urban electricity network and expand rural access in Ethiopia.

                         The Additional Financing of Energy Access Project was effective in June 2011, but major contracts are at the stage of award (Transmission component) or elaboration of bidding
                         documents (Distribution component). First, EEPCo has started implementation with delay and its decision to change the scope related to the design activities of the supervision
                         consultancy delayed further the elaboration of bidding documents for the Distribution works which will not be available before April 2013. Given that this is an 11-year old project
                         (considering the original credit) which has only disbursed 8.32% after 3 years of implementation and will require 24 months to complete outstanding activities, the extension of the
                         closing date was difficult to make. Government of Ethiopia agreed on the cancellation of activities which can' t be completed by closing date. A restructuring is underway.

                         The Rural Electrification Fund has revised its Project Operational Manual and installed Solar PV Systems in about 370 rural primary schools and 545 Health Posts. It has also
                         provided training to village electricians to maintain these PV systems.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The original Credit 3712-ET under the Energy Access Project closed on June 30, 2011, and the GEF component closed on June 30, 2012. Objectives under those two financings are
                         mostly met. However, the additional financing IDA Credit 4795-ET is implemented at a slow pace and Bank agree with Government of Ethiopia to close it on June 30, 2013, as
                         planned.
