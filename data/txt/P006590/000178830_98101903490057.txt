APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT OF
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD, S.A. (ENDESA)
SUMMARY
i.        Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA) the Government-
owned autonomous power company in Chile, which has obtained Bank loans
in 19148, 1956, 1959 and 1965 aggregating US$65.4 million for power sys-
tem expansion has asked for another loan of US$60 million to finance a
portion of the foreign exchange cost of its 5th Power Expansion Program.
Expenditures on the program during the period 1966-1972 are estimated at
US$534 million equivalent, of which US$146 million equivalent would be
the foreign exchange component. Of these totals, expenditures on the
Project proposed for Bank financing would amount to UIS$186 million equiv-
alent, including US$60 million equivalent required to meet foreign
exchange costs.
ii.       The Project would consist of the construction of the El Toro
hydroelectric scheme having an installed capacity of 400 MW scheduled to
be in service by 1972; the construction of double circuit 220 kv trans-
mission lines with a total route length of about 700 km.; the expansion
of existing transmission and distribution systems; the installation of
equipment associated with the fifth 70 MW generating unit at the Rapel
hydroelectric plant; the imported equipment for ENDiEA's new office
building; and the provision of consulting services. The Project is
technically sound, the estimated cost is reasonable, construction schedules
are realistic, and arrangements proposed for construction are acceptable.
iii.      ENDESA's expansion program is designed to provide the additional
generating, transmission and distribution capacity required to meet ex-
pected system load increases. In addition to the Project, the program
includes the completion of the Rapel hydroelectric scheme with an installed
capacity of 280 MW (Bank Loan 244-CH); the completion of small generating
plant additions and distribution expansion (Bank Loan 1402-CH); the con-
struction of the Bocamina thermal electric plant with an installed capacity
of 125 MW; the expansion of transmission and distribution facilities; the
construction of small generating plants to supply isolated areas; and the
commencement of construction of other generating plants to be in service
after 1972.
iv.       ENDESA's management and organization are satisfactory and it is
capable, with the assistance of consultants, of constructing the Project.
ENDESA is also capable of operating the Project after it is completed.



- ii -
v.        ENDESA's present financial position is adequate.  Despite the
difficulties caused by severe inflation over the last years, ENDESA was
able to obtain tariffs to offset these cost increases and, in addition,
improved its earnings position in real terms from a low point of a 2.3%
return on its revalued rate base in fiscal year 1962/63, to 7.7% in
calendar year 1965. With the proposed commitments on tariffs which
would reflect the provisions of the Chilean Electricity Law, ENDESA is
forecast to reach a 9.3% rate of return by 1972. This earnings level
would be satisfactory.
vi.       Under the proposed financing plan for the period 1966-1972,
27% of total construction expenditures would be financed from ENDESA's
internal cash generation after meeting all debt service and dividend
payments, 35% from borrowings, 36% from equity contributions and 2% from
miscellaneous sources. The proposed Bank Loan of US$60 million would
represent about 11% of total construction expenditures. This financing
plan is conservative in its basic assumptions and is satisfactory.
vii.      The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$60 million
for a term of 30 years, including a grace period of about seven years
which corresponds to the construction period of the El Toro hydro scheme.
Interest during construction will be met from ENDESA's own funds.

APPRAISAL OF FIFTH POWER PROJECT OF
EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ELECTRICIDAD S.A. (ENDESA)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        This report appraises the 1966-1972 expansion program of the
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (ENDESA). The program provides
for the completion of generating plants and transmission and distribution
facilities now under construction, the construction of new plants and
facilities to be completed during the period and the commencement of works
to be completed after 1972.
2.        The expenditures on this program are estimated at US$534 million
equivalent, of which US$186 million equivalent would be for the Project
proposed for Bank financing. The Bank has been asked to make a loan of
US$60 million equivalent to cover the estimated foreign exchange cost of
the Project. The other foreign exchange costs of the program are esti-
mated at US$86 million equivalent, of which US$13 million equivalent are
being obtained from Bank loans 24h-CH and 402-CH, and the balance from
other financing.
3.        ENDESA has made detailed studies of the power consumption and
demand in the various regions of the country and has made realistic fore-
casts for the period 1966-1975, including the requirements of the mining
and industrial sectors, which, in the past, have relied principally on
captive plants to meet their needs. The expansion program is designed
to provide the additional generating, transmission and distribution
capacity required to meet the expected load increases.
II. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR IN CHILE
4.       Chile is 2,600 miles long, but only from 55 to 200 miles wide
and stretches from the mild latitudes of southern Peru to the extreme
climate of Cape Horn. This long narrow configuration and the climatic
conditions have had a major influence upon its economic development and
consequently on the character of the Power Sector.
5.        The country is divided by ENDESA into seven regions for admin-
istrative purposes. (See Maps 1 and 2.) The two northern regions (1
and 2) are desert and sparsely populated and public power supply is
confined to a few isolated towns, although the bulk of the captive
plants in the country serve the mines in these regions. The two southern
regions (6 and 7) are also very sparsely populated and have severe cli-
matic conditions; public power supply is only available in a very few



- 2 -
isolated small towns. About 91% of the population and over 96% of the
energy generated for public service is in the Interconnected System
area which is located principally in Regions 3, 4 and 5.
6.        Responsibility for the generation of power is being concen-
trated in ENDESA, a government-owned autonomous power company which
supplies power in bulk to a number of privately-owned and mixed compa-
nies, cooperatives and small entities, some of which are ENDESA's own
subsidaries, which distribute power at various locations throughout the
country. Cia Chilena de Electricidad (CCE), a privately-owned company,
is the largest of these. It serves the major part of the 3rd region,
containing 55% of the country's public power demand. CCE generates
about 58% of its own power requirements and purchases the balance from
ENDESA. The Government signed an agreement in 1965 to acquire the com-
pany but has not yet completed the purchase. The Government intends CCE
to continue to distribute power but will not authorize it to build any
new generating plants. The other distributing companies only have an
aggregate of about 20 MW of generating plant and purchase practically
their entire power requirements from ENDESA.
7.        The captive plants in the mines and industry comprise the
remaining major segment of the power sector. These purchase about 15%
of the power generated by ENDESA to supplement their own power generation.
8.        At the end of 1965, the country had a total of 1,424 MW of
generating capacity divided as follows:- (i) ENDESA 5h7 MW; (ii) other
utility companies, principally CCE, 337 MW; and (iii) captive plants in
mines and industry 540 MW. During 1965 a total of 6,157 million kilowatt
hours of energy were generated; of this total 2,615 million kwh or about
h2% were generated by ENDESA. Captive plants generated 2,525 million
kwh or about 41%. The remaining 1,017 million kwh or about 17% were
generated by the other companies (principally CCE).
III. THE BORROWER
9.        ENDESA was created by the Government in 194h as an autonomous
power company for the general planning of power supply in Chile and to
supply power where other companies were not able to meet the demand.
10.       The purchase of CCE by the Government would radically alter the
character of the Power Sector and change the function of ENDESA. Since
CCE will in future depend upon ENDESA to satisfy all increases in its
power demand, and none of the other public service entities plans to
construct additional generating facilities, the entire responsibility for
providing generating plant will fall on ENDESA. In the mining and in-
dustrial sectors considerable reliance is placed upon captive plants but
this situation is expected to change and future growth in this demand is
expected to be met increasingly by bulk power purchases from ENDESA.



-3-
11.       ENDESA is a joint stock company in which Corporacion de Fomento
de la Produccion (CORFO), the Government's development agency, holds 97%
of the shares. The remainder are held by individual stock-holders.
ENDBMA is subject to regulation by the Tariff Commission and must obtain
its concessions from the Director General of Electric Services in the
same way as the other power entities; it also pays income, other taxes
and customs duties.
12.       Under Chilean law, CORFO is authorized to lend to or invest in
public or private entities. It obtains funds for this purpose from the
national budget, borrowings, income on investments and repayment of
advances. It makes substantial contributions to ENDESA annually. In order
to enable the government to guarantee the Bank loan, under Chilean law,
CORFO must be a co-borrower as in previous Bank loans. The same
arrangements would apply in the proposed loan.
13.       ENDESA with CORFO as co-borrower obtained Bank loans in 1948,
1956, 1959 and 1965 aggregating US$65.4 million to finance the foreign
exchange cost of four power system expansion projects to add about 600 MW
of generating plant to its system of which about 280 MW are still under
construction.
Management and Organization
114.      In 1960 iNDESA adopted a new management and organization
structure and engaged the French firm of Paul Planus as consultants to
make a study of its budgetary and accounting practices.
15.       The reorganization, started in 1960, has resulted in improved
efficiency and has pointed the way toward further improvements now being
made.
16.       The firm of Paul Planus has been given another contract to
continue and extend its studies and assist in the implementation of
recommendations previously made. Special attention is being given to
the preparation of basic data and the processing of information so
that it can be made available in suitable form quickly enough to make an
effective contribution towards management decisions.
17.       ENDESA has started construction of a new office building to house
its management and administrative departments, now scattered over eight
locations in Santiago. It is a much needed improvement and is consistent
with the other efforts, mentioned above, to improve the efficiency and
performance of the enterprise.
18.       ENDESA's general management and organization are satisfactory
and the steps being taken with the help of consultants to attain further
improvement will enable it to keep abreast of the demands of a rapidly
growing system.

Existing Installations
19.       ENDESA's operations extend throughout Chile.   Its principal
installations consist of: (i)  95 MW of hydro plants in capacities of
0.1 nMW to 136 MW at 11 locations of which 476 MW serves the Intercon-
nected System, and (ii) 51.7 MW of thermal plants in capacities of 0.15
MI to 15 MW at 14 locations outside the Interconnected System; all are
diesel units except the 15 MW Huasco steam plant and serve small isolated
towns or areas. All the towns and power plants in Regions 3, 4 and 5,
the southern part of Region 2 and the island of Chiloe in the 6th Region
are linked by about 1,400 km. of 154 kv and 110 kv transmission lines to
form the Interconnected System.
20.       ENDESA's installations are satisfactorily maintained and effi-
ciently operated.
Installations under Construction
21.       At the present time ENDESA has under construction the Rapel
Hydro-electric plant (4 x 70 MW) and a 220 kv, 120 km. double circuit
transmission line from the plant to Santiago (Bank Loan No. 2h4-CH).
The plant has suffered about 3 years delay due to unusual floods, earth-
quakes, prolonged strikes and geological problems. It is now expected
to come into service in 1968. The delays in the Rapel project can be
attributed in part to inadequate planning and a lack of construction
management flexibility in meeting emergency and unforeseen conditions.
ENDESA is arranging to overcome these problems by engaging suitable
consultants as described in Chapter VIII, Consultants. A fifth 70 MW
unit, which was contemplated in the original design of the plant, would
be added now to obtain a total capacity of 350 MW by 1970.
IV. ENDESA POWER MARKET
22.       The power market may be conveniently divided into, (a) the
Interconnected System, (b) the sparsely populated Regions 1, 2, 6 and 7,
and (c) the mines and industry served by captive plants. The relative
importance of these markets can be seen from the following tabulation:
1965
Maximum Demand Energy Generated
(MW)             (grwh)
(a)  Interconnected System           811             3,559
(b)  Regions 1, 2, 6 and 7            73                110
(c)  Captive Plants                  5h0              2,525



- 5-
The Interconnected System
23.       The energy consumed in the Interconnected System in 1965 was
generated by the following entities. It will be seen that ENDESA
supplied about 70%.
Generating Plant       Energy
Entity                             Capacity (MW)     Generated (gwh)
ENDE;A                               476.0              2,481.0
CCE                                  316.5                939.0
Cia General Elec. Industrial          16.8                 28.4
Cia Nacional Fuerza Electrica          1.5                  8.2
Captive Plants                        46.1                102.6
856.9              3,559.2
24.       ENDESA has made a detailed study of the past growth of power
consumption by regions and by sectors of the economy. It has also
developed a correlation between the use of electric power in the
Interconnected System and growth in the Gross Domestic Product. The
average annual increase in power consumption so derived is 8.5%, based
on a growth rate of 5.5% annually in the Gross Domestic Product which is
consistent with the Bank's report on the Chilean economy.
25.       A separate study was also made by ENDESA of the mining and
industrial sectors in which the Government is actively promoting development.
Two assumptions were considered regarding the power requirements of these
sectors: (a) that these sectors would not substantially add to the
captive plants they now have but would purchase the increase in their
power needs from ENDESA; (b) that these sectors would continue as at
present to purchase about 15% of ENDESA's output. When these two assumptions
are coordinated with the forecast of growth for other customers based
upon past trends (see paragraph 24), two consolidated forecasts are
obtained for the Interconnected System: (a) a high growth rate of
9.2% per annum between 1966-1970 and 9.6% between 1971-1975, (b) a lower
growth rate of 7.8% per annum between 1966-1970 and 8.3% between 1971-1975.
See Annex 1 for further details.
26.       The forecasts of maximum demand for the Interconnected System
were derived from the above forecasts of energy consumption and these are
shown graphically in Attachment 2 of Annex 1, together with the proposed
program of generating plant additions.
27.       The present system capacity will be barely sufficient to meet
demand during 1966 and 1967 and any plant failure would cause a power
shortage. From 1968 the planned program of plant additions would provide
ENDESA with sufficient firm capacity to meet demand until 1975, assuming
load growth follows the high forecast. If the forecast is exceeded an
additional 100 MW thermal unit could be installed at the CCE's Ventanas
plant. On the other hand, if load growth follows the low forecast, the
construction of future plants for service after 1972 could be delayed.



- 6 -
28.       The level of demand and sales reached during 1966-1975 will
depend upon the progress made in developing the mining and industrial
sectors. In view of past performance in Chile it would be more realistic
to expect load and sales to grow at about the level of the low forecast and
ENDESA has used this to estimate its future revenues.
Regions 1, 2, 6 and 7
29.       The demand for power in each of these regions is very small.
ENDESA has made individual forecasts of demand and sales for each region
which are reasonable and small system additions are included in ENDESA's
program to meet forecast demand.
V. ENDESA's EXPAISION PROGRAM
30.       The 1966-1972 expansion program provides for the completion of
works now in progress, new works to be completed during the period and
the commencement of works which will be completed after 1972.
31.       ENDESA's Planning Department is satisfactorily organized and
staffed. Continuous studies are made of system requirements and potenti-
al plants. Economic and technical analyses of the alternatives are made.
The program of major generating plant and tranemission line additions for
service in 1966 to 1972 is the best of the alternatives. The major plant
additions for service after 1972 and small plant and system improvements
after 1968-69 are tentative and are subject to further review.
32.       The 1966-1972 program consists of the following:

34.       The Bocamina Thermal Plant which ENDESA is constructing on a
turnkey basis with suppliers' financing is required to avoid a power
shortage in 1970. The Rapel plant was originally scheduled to be in
service in 1965 and El Toro in 1970. Because of the difficulties expe-
rianced on Rapel (see paragraph 21) ENDESA has been forced to delay work
on El Toro which is now scheduled to be in service in 1972. The Bocamina
construction arrangements and financing terms are satisfactory and the
plant is scheduled to be in service in 1969. It is to burn coal from the
Lota Schwager mines near Concepcion, part of which is not otherwise
marketable.
VI. THE PROJECT
35.       The Project proposed for Bank financing (which consists of
Items iv, vi,and ix, and part of v, vii and viii paragraph 32 above, of
ENDESA's 1966-1972 expansion program), is described below. A more de-
tailed description of the Project is given in Annex 3.
The El Toro Hydroelectric Scheme
36.       The El Toro scheme would be located at Lake Laja in Region 4,
about 150 km. east of Concepcion. A site plan of the scheme is shown in
Annex 3.
37.       The scheme would have a firm capacity of 400 MW and an esti-
mated annual output of 1,800 million kwh and would utilize about 4,000
million cubic meters of usable storage from Lake Laja. Water would be
diverted from the lake through a deep intake into a tunnel, about 8.9 km.
in length, to an underground power house equipped with four 100 MW gener-
ating units utilizing the head of about 562 meters. A tailrace tunnel,
some 220 meters in length, would convey the waters discharged from the
plant to the Polcura river.
38.       The hydrology of the region has been studied since 1903.   De-
tailed site investigations on the geology of the area have been carried
out by ENDESA, assisted by consultants. The location of the power house
was selected by the consultants who will be responsible for its design.
39.       More energy will be produced by discharging the water from Lake
Laja through the El Toro plant, under a head of 562 meters rather than
through the existing Abanico plant which has a head of only 147 meters.
Accordingly, ENDESA plans to convert Abanico to a peaking plant and will
construct a small reservoir on the Laja River to facilitate its operation.
1he economic justification of El Toro is based on the net increase of gen-
eration from the combined El Toro and Abanico plants.



40.       In order to obtain the required fluw into Lake Laja a scheme
to divert the upper Polcura river and two of its tributaries, called the
Alto Polcura Diversion, has been planned to augment the present natural
inflow to the lake. See Annex 3. The scheme would consist of two earth-
fill dams, about 10 km. of tunnel, and about 2 km. of canal to divert the
water into the lake. The hydrology, geology, and the design of the scheme
have been carried out by ENDESA assisted by the consultants used for El
Toro.
41.       ENDESA intends to use its own staff and work force to construct
the El Toro scheme and Abanico reservoir and has agreed to engage consul-
tants as outlined in Chapter VIII, to assist it in the planning, manage-
ment and carrying out of the work so as to make the most effective use of
its staff and workers. Only the imported equipment and consulting servicss
would be financed under the proposed Bank loan.
42.       ENDESA intends to let the construction of the Alto Polcura
diversion on contract under the Bank's procedures for international compe-
titive bidding and the entire amount of the contract would be eligible for
financing under the proposed Bank loan.
Excpansion of the Rapel Hydroelectric Plant.
43.       A fifth 70 MW generating unit is to be installed to complete the
plant as originally planned and some related transmission line extensions
are to be constructed. Only imported equipment procured by international
competitive bidding will be financed from the proposed loan.
Transmission Expansion
44.       The addition of the El Toro hydroelectric scheme and the Bocamina
thermal plant in the 4th Region and the Rapel hydroelectric scheme in the
3rd region make it essential to construct a trunk transmission system to
interconnect the Santiago and Concepcion areas and supply the existing 154
kv and 110 kv systems through substations. The trunk system is tentatively
planned to consist of double circuit 220 kv transmission lines, about 420
km. in route length, with intermediate and terminal substations. The El
Toro and Bocamina plants would be connected to the trunk system by 220 kv
transmission lines of 270 km route length.
45        The erection of the transmission lines and substations would be
carried out by ENDESA's own work force with consultants to assist in the
design of the lines and substations and testing of equipment. Similar
procedures are being followed for the Rapel-Santiago 220 kv transmission
line now under construction. ENDESA proposes to procure the insulators,
conductor and hardware by international competitive bidding and would in-
clude the financing under the proposed loan. The towers would be fabri-
cated in Chile of Chilean steel and would be financed by ENDESA.



- 10 -
Distribution Expansion
46..      ENDIEA supplies power in bulk to a number of small affiliated
e acee  co-operatives, and local entities which distribute power in
small towns and rural areas. To meet the increasing demands of these
distributors during 1966-1972, ENDESA has a program of 66 kv and 23 kv
overhead line extensions. The lines would be owned by ENDESA but would
be operated by the distributors. Part of this program, covering the years
1966-1969, is included in the Project, and it is proposed that the Bank
finance the foreign exchange cost of materials and equipment required
during this period.
ENDESA Office Building
47.       The construction of a new office building for ENDESA in Santiago
is included in the Project, and the procurement of imported electrical and
air conditioning equipment and elevators which are not available in Chile,
would be included in the proposed loan.
System Studies and Consulting Services
48.       Details of ENDESA's proposals for engaging the services of con-
sultants are given in Chapter VIII headed "Consultants."
Estimated Cost of the Project
49.       Detailed cost estimates of the Project are given in Annex 3.
A summary of the cost estimates is as follows:
Foreign
Local   Exchange    Total
Cost      Cost      Cost
(in millions of Escudos)
El Toro Scheme                         368.0     197.6     565.6
Rapel Expansion                         16.0       8.3      24.3
Transmission Expansion                 l14.4      33.0     137.4
Distribution Expansion                  73.3       7.3      80.6
ENDESA Office Building                  29.0       2.6      31.6
Studies and Consulting Services         16.6       3.2      19.8
TOTAL                                  607.3     252.0     859.3
Total Expressed in Millions of US$     144.6      60.0     204.6
NOTE: The cost estimates given above include E° 49 million of ex-
penditures on El Toro and EO 4 million on the office buildings made
prior to 1966, and an estimated EO 23.7 million of expenditures on
El Toro to be made in 1973 and 1974. Excluding these, the total ex-
penditures on the Project during the 1966-1972 period are estimated
at EO 782.6 million, or US$186 million equivalent.



- 11 -
50.       The cost estimates are the results of detailed studies made by
ENDESA of the cost of equipment, materials and labor for each item. They
are based, where possible, on similar works recently completed or under
construction in Chile. The estimates include adequate contingency allow-
alices and are realistic. The estimated cost of the El Toro scheme, in-
cluding the Alto Polcura diversion is US$306/kw installed, which is
reasonable.
51.       The Bank's procurement procedures will be followed by ENDESA for
purchasing all goods and services which would be financed under the pro-
posed loan.
VII. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION OF EL TORO
52.       ENDESA selected the El Toro hydroelectric scheme as the pre-
ferred alternative after comparing it with other possible hydroelectric
developments. The studies included a discounted cash flow comparison of
the costs of the El Toro scheme and the thermal alternative. The studies
made by ENDESA are satisfactory and the choice of El Toro is economically
justified.
VIII. CONSULTANTS
53.       ENDESA has used consultants for the preparatory studies and
design phases of the El Toro plant, for transmission line design and
testing and for accounting and budgeting procedures. This practice of
engaging specialized assistance has been encouraged by the Bank in the
past and has been of considerable value to ENDESA.
54.       In carrying out the Project ENDESA is making arrangements to
use consultants, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for
the following purposes:
(1) to assist in supervising the construction of the El Toro deep
intake;
(2) to assist in the design of the El Toro underground power house
and pressure tunnel;
(3) to provide specialized personnel to review the construction plan
for El Toro, to advise on construction equipment and to provide
specialists to assist in supervising all aspects of construction,
including assistance at the foreman level should this be re-
quired;
(4) to provide personnel to instruct ENDESA's staff in the use of
construction equipment and to operate the equipment until the
staff can take over;



- 12 -
(5) to review the entire transmission system and make recommendations
on the voltage and transmission lines requirements to meet system
demand;
(6) to assist in the design of the transmission system and the
testing of towers;
(7) to review and evaluate the tenders for the Bocamina steam
plant and serve as ENDESA:s inspector for the construction;
(8) to continue the accounting and budgetary procedures review now
being conducted and to implement recommendations previously made;
(9) to review ENDESA's fature power development plans for the
1972-1980 period.
IX.   FINANCIAL ASPECTS
55.       ENDESA's fiscal year ends June 30.    In addition, accounts
have to be prepared on a calendar year basis to support tariff applications
under the existing regulatory law.   ENDESA's management is considering
changing its fiscal year to the calendar year in the near future to
simplify accounting procedures.   For this reason and to illustrate
better the adequacy of the provisions of the regulatory law, the
financial forecasts in this report are shown on a calendar year basis.
56.       ENDESA's financial statements are audited by Price Waterhouse
Peat & Co.   This arrangement is satisfactory and assurances were obtained
during negotiations that external auditors acceptable to the Bank would
continue to audit ENDESA's accounts.
Tariffs
57.       Electricity tariffs in Chile are regulated by a Tariff Commission
in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Law of 1959 (Ley
General de Servicios Electricos DFL No. 4L, as amended).   The Tariff
Commission is an autonomous public body, responsible to the Controller
General of the Country, and is composed of five members representing
the Government, CORFO, the Chilean Institute of Engineers and consumer
interests.   It acts on all matters related to tariffs for the sale
of power and telecommunications services after hearing both the case of
the applying entity and of the consumers.
58.       The Tariff Commission is assisted by the Direccion General de
Servicios Electricos (DGSE), an agency under the Ministry of the Interior,
whose director-general is the ex-officio chairman of the Tariff
Commission.   The DGSE exercises control over concessions in the power
and telecommunication fields and is required to study all tariff appli-
c~ations and to report its findings and recommendations to the Tariff
Commission.   These recommendations assume the character of final
resolutions if the Commission fails to act within a specified time.
The DGSE is also authorized to permit public utility enterprises to



- 13 -
charge provisional tariffs pending the final ruling of the Tariff
Commission.
59.       In essence the Electricity Law provides, for each concession,
a 10% return on its rate base which comprises existing plant in service
net of accumulated depreciation plus an allowance for working capital
and intangible assets.   The rate base as approved by the Tariff Commission
is revalued annually, at the end of each year, in proportion to the
increase in the cost-of-living index during the year; it
then forms the basis for reviewing the adequacy of tariffs to produce
a 10% return during the subsequent year.   The regulatory law recognizes
all operating costs including adequate depreciation, which in the case
of power enterprises ranges between 2-1/2% and 4% of revalued
depreciable property.   Operating income for purposes of the return
computation is taken before deducting income tax.
60.       In the years following the enactment of the Electricity Law
in 1959 ENDESA did not earn the stipulated return.   A disastrous earth-
quake in 1960 caused a slowdown in the economy of the country and
seriously affected power sales.   Subsequently there was a resumption of
strong inflation.   The provisions of the Law which would have remedied
this situation were not applied with the necessary expedition by the
regulatory agencies, and as a result ENDESA's return on investment
declined from 5.9% in 1959 to a low point of 2.3% in fiscal year 1962/63.
In the preparatory stage for Loan 402-CH in 1963 and 1964i the question
of tariffs was discussed in detail with ENDESA and the regulatory agencies.
Improvements in the administrative process of tariff regulation were
introduced and a program of increases over and above adjustments for
inflation was initiated.   By 1965 the return had risen to a level of
7.7%. Annex h shows a summary of the rates of return for ENDESA's
operations between 1962 and 1965.
61.       ENDESA's service area is broken down into a number of concessions
representing the geographical regions of the interconnected or primary
system and its wholly-owned distribution subsidiaries in various parts
of the country.   This system of separate concessions provides the
desirable flexibility for selective tariff increases instead of global
increases which might meet strong opposition.   Annex 4 also illustrates
the problem of the distribution companies which for the most part are
small and serve isolated areas; most of them have been unable to meet
all their expenses despite average sales prices that are more than
2-1/2 times higher than those of the primary systems.   Tariff increases
to yield the full 10% return for each of these small companies would be
prohibitively high; ENDESA plans therefore to better the situation on
a step by step basis through selective tariff increases and through
technical and operational improvements of these systems.   The rate of
return from ENDESA's total operations would not be significantly affected
by this shortfall in some of the concessions to reach the 10% level since
the distribution companies represent only a small percentage (a 9%
average for the last four years) of ENDESA's total rate base.
62.       In previous loan agreements ENDESA agreed to take all necessary
steps to obtain tariffs which would provide revenues sufficient to cover



- 14 -
operating expenses, debt service and "a reasonable surplus for financing
the expansion of its power facilities".   This covenant reflected the
Bank's concern over ENDESA's cash position in view of its sizeable
expansion program.   It was introduced at a time when the administrative
process of tariff regulation was far from satisfactory.    This situation
has now improved.   The Government through DGSE and the Tariff Commission
has during the past two years judiciously applied the provisions of the
Law and has established a satisfactory working relation with ENDESA which
resulted in a marked improvement of ENDESA's financial sLtuation despite
general inflationary cost increases.   During negotiations it was there-
fore agreed to include a tariff covenant in the Agreement for the proposed
loan which reflects the rate of return concept of the Electricity Law.
In addition the Government undertook to assist ENDESA in obtaining the
required rate of return by instructing the DGSE accordingly.    In
particular, the DGSE will in the future, when required, exercise its
authority to grant provisional tariffs to ENDESA (see paragraph 58).
The specific arrangements concerning ENDESA's level of return for the
various concessions in the primary systems and the distribution companies
is dealt with in paragraph 81.
63.       In order to emphasize the importance of the Electricity Law
and the Bank's concern for its proper application in the case of ENDESA
commitments were obtained from the Government and the borrowers that the
Bank would be promptly informed of any proposal to amend any provision
of the Electricity Law concerning electricity tariffs.    ENDESA will
furthermore report on a continuous basis, (a) any applications for tariff
adjustment, (b) the estimated increase applied for, (c) the increase
tl:rough provisional tariffs and the date when they were granted by DGSE,
and (d) the amount of the increase and the date of final approval by the
Tariff Commission.   At the beginning of each year ENDESA will also report
on the actual results of the past year with a specific explanation in all
those cases where the 10% rate of return was not achieved.
64.       During the past year, the Government's Price Control Office
has added electricity to its list of "items of basic necessity."    In
consequence, at least theoretically, changes in electric tariffs must
be approved by two agencies - the Tariff Commission and the Price Control
Office.   In order to avoid any duplication in the administrative
process the Government has given the assurance that it will cause all
approvals, required for the effectiveness of electricity tariffs, to be
taken without delay.
Present Financial Position
65.       Annex 5 shows summary balance sheets as of June 30 for the
years 1963 through 1966.   ENDESA consolidates the accounts of its wholly-
owned subsidiaries (distribution companies) with those of its primary
systems.   Total fixed assets in operation and work in progress as of
June 30, 1966 amounted to E01,850 million which would have been equivalent
to about US$463 million at the then applicable foreign exchange rate;
after deducting the depreciation reserve of E0373 million total net fixed
assets were E01,477 million (US$369 million).    These figures reflect
investment in plant at cost plus the annual revaluation in accordance



- 15 -
with the present Income Tax Law.   A revaluation factor is applied
representing the increase in the cost of living index during the period
covered by the financial statements, i.e. for the twelve months period
ending in June of each year.   The revaluation of fixed assets for purposes
of the Electricity Law is done on the same basis using the increase in
the cost of living index between January and December of each year.
Although the continued application of cost of living indices might lead
to a certain distortion, i.e. probably to an over-statement, in the
fixed asset valuation, these revaluation procedures are acceptable as a
practical solution to the problem of inflation in connection with the
specific purposes (taxation and tariff setting) for which they were
introduced.
66.       The depreciation reserve as of June 30, 1966 amounted to 28%
of fixed assets in operation and is also subject to revaluation.   In
fiscal year 1964/65 new depreciation rates allowed under the Income Tax
Law were used which are considerably higher than those previously
permitted under the Electricity Law.   In fact the depreciation provision
for 1965/66 amounted to E050 million which would correspond to an overall
depreciation rate of about 4% on depreciable assets as compared to 2.5%
in previous years.   This high rate of depreciation is applicable for
income tax purposes and shown in ENDESA's profit and loss statement; for
tariff setting purposes the lower provisions of the Electricity Law,
at the level of previous years, still apply (see paragraph 59).
67.       ENDESA's capitalization as of the end of June 30, 1966 was
as follows:
(in millions of E°)
Equity
Share capital - authorized 800 million shares
of E01 par, issued 750 million shares 1/               750.00

- 16 -
68.       ENDESA's authorized share capital was increased from E0350 million
to E0800 million in April 1965; by June 1966 750 million shares had been
issued.   About 97% of all shares outstanding as of June 30, 1966 were
held by CORFO, the remainder distributed among some 30 different share-
holders (municipalities, private enterprises and individuals).   Shares
have been issued from time to time in the past against the accumulated
revaluation reserve, CORFO advances and, to a much smaller extent,
contributions from consumers.   CORPO advances, all of which carry 8%
interest, consist of (a) cash contributions, (b) payment of debt service
on IBRD and some other foreign loans, (c) reinvested dividends received
from ENDESA, (d) reinvested interest on outstanding advances to ENDESA
and (e) small budgetary appropriations under the Copper Law.   Considering
CORFO's holdings of ENDESA shares and the proportion of equity in ENDESA's
total capitalization (86%) it is obvious that ENDESA's expansion in the
past has been financed to a large extent by equity contributions from
CORFO.
69.       About 14% of ENDESA's capitalization as of June 30, 1966 was
represented by long-term debt.   The outstanding amounts of the previous
four IBRD loans to ENDESA totalled US$40.9 million.   The original amounts
of the loans were (a) US$13.5 million for 5-CH, (b) US$15 million for
153-CH, (c) US$32.5 million for 244-CH and (d) US$4.4 million for 402-CH;
US$4.7 million and Us$1.8 million respectively remained as undisbursed
balances in (c) and (d) as of September 30, 1966.   An AID loan of
E014.4 million equivalent was made available in 1963 through CORFO;
it carries interest at 2% and is repayable over 40 years including a ten-
year grace period.   The remainder of long-term debt represents suppliers
credits, loans obtained through CORFO or the Government from Eximbank,
the British Government and a Swiss banking consortium, reimbursable
advances from customers and deferred customs duties.   Interest rates
for these debts vary between 5-3/4% and 7% and repayment terms between
5 and 15 years.
70.       A review was made of ENDESA's working capital position which
was found adequate.   The year-end cash balance of E010.4 million was
equivalent to about two months average operating expenses which is
sufficient to meet ENDESA's liquidity needs in view of its large expansion
program.   Consumer accounts receivable of E020.8  million corresponded
to less than two months average monthly billings.   Operating inventories
and materials in transit were on the high side at E028.9 million.
ENDESA intends to reduce these inventories and to maintain them on a
lower level by taking advantage of improved warehousing procedures.
Past Earnings Record
71.       Income statements for the fiscal years 1962/63 through
1965/66 are shown in Annex 6; they represent the consolidated results
of the operations in ENDESA's primary systems and distribution companies.
Return figures computed on the basis of the Electricity Law drop from
4% to 2.3% in 1962/63 rising to 7.7% in 1965/66.   This recent improvement
in ENDESA's earnings picture has been explained earlier (see paragraph 60).
As shown in Annex 4 on a calendar year basis, the actual increases in



- 17 -
average revenue per kwh over the preceding year to achieve this improvement
were as follows:
Calendar Year                  1963    1964    1965
Primary systems                      33%    6o%      62%
Distribution companies              19%     66%      54%
ENDESA total                        32%      61%     60%
The high level of increases in 1964 and 1965 was necessary to offset
inflationary cost increases in these years in addition to improving the
return on investment in real terms.
72.       Annual dividends have been paid in the past following the close
of the fiscal year at the rate of 2.7% of par for the A shares which
account for 99.94% of total share capital (paragraph 67); the small block
of B shares is entitled to a 7% dividend.    Over the past four years
ENDESA has paid out in dividends about 61% of its earnings; the major
portion of these payments went to CORFO.
73.       The low earnings level in past years and the unavailability
of adequate long-term loan funds have forced ENDESA to depend heavily
on equity funds from CORFO.   An estimate for the past four years shows
that ENDESA financed about 17% of its capital expenditures from internal
cash generation after meeting all debt service and dividend payments,
about 18% from borrowings and 65% from CORFO contributions.    As long as
borrowings are limited to foreign exchange expenditures and local
currency financing is not available in adequate amounts or on suitable
terms the pressure on CORFO can only be relieved by increasing ENDESA's
contribution from earnings.   The return of 7.7% for the calendar year
1965 represents an acceptable starting point which should enable ENDESA
to reach the forecast return levels within the specified time limits
(see paragraphs 80 and 81).
Proposed Financing Plan
74.       The financing plan for the proposed program 1966 to 1972 is
whown in Annex 7 and can be summarized as follows:

Would be met from:
Internal cash generation                   1,143.44           272.25

Other borrowings                            51l.19          122.43

As percentage of total construction expenditures      28%
75.       The forecast covers a period of high capital expenditures for
ENDESA which during the seven years to 1972 would almost triple its fixed
assets in operation outstanding as of December 31, 1965 (at stable
prices).   The purpose of the forecast is to analyze the sources of funds
available to meet these heavy capital requirements with particular emphasis
on ENDESA's contributions from earnings.   The forecasts were cut off in
1972 when the first stage of the El Toro project is scheduled for
operation and the second stage is virtually completed.
76.       ENDESA's internal cash generation is estimated on the basis of
the forecast income statement 1966 to 1972 as shown in Annex 8.  For
purposes of this forecast it is assumed that ENDESA would only be able
to achieve the projected lower growth rate in sales mentioned in
paragraph 25.   Fixed and variable operating expenses were forecast in
detail for ENDESA's primary systems and distribution companies and a
2-1/2% depreciation rate applied to ENDESA's estimated depreciable
assets.   This depreciation rate is adequate for the present structure
of ENDESA's fixed assets; however, since the composition of its fixed
assets will change in the future ENDESA will periodically review the
level of depreciation applicable for tariff setting purposes and make
adjustments, when required.  The return used by ENDESA is the legal 10%
level for the primary systems starting with 1967.   This goal appears
attainable since the return for 1966 should be more than 9%.  Distribution
companies which will probably show a consolidated loss of 1% in 1966
are assumed to show a small profit in 1967 and would improve their return
to 6% by 1972.   For the reasons given in paragraph 61 this is an
acceptable forecast.



- 19 -
77.       The borrowings included in the proposed financing plan are
as follows:
(a) The undisbursed balances of loans 244-CH and 402-CH which
would be utilized by 1969.
(b) The undisbursed balances of existing foreign exchange loans
amounting to about US$716,000 from Eximbank, the British Government and
the Swiss banking consortium which would be drawn down by 1967.
(c) A five year loan of US$1 million from the Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Company in New York at 7% interest which would be disbursed
in 1966 and a loan from the German Government of US$264,000 for a 15
year term at 5% interest which would be utilized in 1967.
(d) The proposed IBRD loan of US$60 million to be obtained
towards the end of 1966 for a term of 30 years including a grace period
of about seven years corresponding to the construction period of the
El Toro project.   The first half-yearly amortization payment would be
made on January 1, 197h.   For the purposes of this forecast an interest
rate of 6% has been assumed; interest during the disbursement period
would not be-included in the loan amount.
(e) Suppliers' credit financing will be accepted by ENDESA for
the Bocamina plant.   After evaluating bids for this turnkey project it
is understood that ENDESA intends to award the bid to the Gruppo Industrie
Elettromeccaniche (GIE, Italy) which offered financing of about US$17
million; the terms are not yet definitive, but have been assumed at
7% interest and 12-1/2 years of amortization with a 3-1/2 year period
of grace, except for 5% in down and progress payments during construction.
(f) Two future loans to cover the foreign exchange cost of ENDESA's
program not yet provided for.   The first of US$1l million would be
obtained in 1968 for an assumed term of 23 years including a three-
year grace period during disbursement, at an interest rate of 6%.    A
second loan is assumed for 1971 to finance the next major steps in
ENDESA's expansion program.   The initial disbursements in 1971 and 1972
would amount to US$36 million.
(g) The local currency borrowings assumed represent: (i) deferred
customs duties payable over a term equivalent to the repayment period
of the loans used to finance the imported items and (ii) reimbursable
advances from consumers which are forecast in proportion to the estimated
distribution work in ENDESAts program.
The loans under (a), (b) and (c) have already been incurred and the
financing under (e) and (g) can be assumed as assured.    The amounts of
the assumed loans under (f) are contingent on future reviews of ENDESA's
expansion requirements which may result in a rephasing of plant additions
(paragraphs 27 and 31).
78.       The CORFO contributions would total E0819 million (US$195
million) for the seven-year period 1966/1972.    The requirement in 1966



- 20 -
is E0128 million; it remains at the same level in 1967 and declines
then to E054 million in 1969 and E059 million in 1970 before reaching
much higher levels again in 1971 and 1972.    It can reasonably be assumed
that CORFO will be able to contribute the amounts required through 1970.
The need for the high contributions in 1971 and 1972 would depend on the
necessity for the large generating capacity additions subsequent to
El Toro.   If these projects are postponed CORFO's contributions during
those two years would be considerably reduced.
79.       Total construction expenditures 1966 to 1972 would be financed
28% from internal cash generation (after meeting all debt service and
dividend payments), 34% from borrowings, 36% from CORFO's contributions
and 2% from miscellaneous sources.   The plant additions shown in the
financing plan can be considered as the maximum program.    It assumed that
the construction of major generating capacity additions to be in service
after 1972 would have to start about 1969 although this would only be
required if the high growth rate of sales mentioned in paragraph 25 were
to materialize.   Since only the lower growth rate was used to calculate
revenues, the forecast contains a margin to this extent.    The financing
plan appears satisfactory.
Estimated Future Financial Position
80.       Forecast income statements for the period 1966 to 1972 are
shown in Annex 8.   Basic assumptions used for this forecast were mentioned
in paragraph 76.   Net income from operations would increase from
E072 million in 1966 to E0169 million in 1972.    ENDESA's consolidated
rate of return would increase from 7.8% in 1966 to 9.3% in 1972 assuming
a 10% return in the primary systems and increasing but lower returns in
the distribution companies.   The year 1969 is an exception to this
trend with the rate of return of 6.3% due to the fact that in this year
the large investment of the Rapel project enters ENDESA's rate base.
ENDESA's proposal to forego the full 10% return on the primary systems
for 1969 in order to avoid an excessive increase of tariffs in one year
merits consideration, particularly since it does not seem to endanger
the cash flow for the year; this would however not exclude the need for
tariff increases to compensate for possible future inflationary cost
increases during this year.   The forecasts assume the following increases
in average revenue per kwh over the preceding year through 1972:
1967   1968   1969   1970   1971   1972
Primary systems           1%       -     26%    12%    1%
Distribution companies    3%      5%    17%     9%     5%      9%
ENDESA probably should have no difficulty in obtaining these increases
over and above any adjustments that might be required to offset inflation.
It should also be mentioned that the estimates of operating cost might
prove to be conservative since they represent extrapolations of past
trends.   AS ENDESA is able to improve its operational and cost control
procedures, these estimates of operating costs could be reduced.



- 21 -
81.       For purposes of the proposed tariff covenant and the supple-
mental understandings on tariffs mentioned in paragraphs 62 and 63, the
basic assumptions on the future level of earnings were used.    It was
agreed that (a) the legal 10% rate of return should be obtained for the
investment in the primary systems starting with 1967, (b) the rate of
return on investment in the distribution companies should be continuously
improved to a minimum level of 6% in 1972, and (c) tariff proposals which
would achieve less than full compliance with these commitments should be
brought to the Bank's attention immediately, as part of the reporting on
tariff adjustments described in paragraph 63.
82.       Net profit would rise from E041 million in 1966 to E082 million
in 1972.   It is assumed that ENDESA will allocate annually 60% of these
amounts to reserve and will pay out 40% in dividends to its shareholders.
A major proportion of the dividend payments will continue to go to
CORFO and would be reinvested as equity contributions.
83.       Annual internal cash generation would increase from E0102
million in 1966 to E0225 million by 1972.    It would cover total debt
service between 2.4 and 4.0 times.   The debt service considered in these
ratios includes payments that are actually made by CORFO on behalf of
ENDESA and interest charges on CORFO's advances which are reinvested as
equity contributions by CORFO.   The debt service coverages are more
than adequate and mainly reflect the low debt capitalization of ENDESA.
84.       Internal cash generation net of total debt service and dividends
would finance 28% of total construction expenditures (paragraph 74).
This percentage is adequate considering the size of ENDESA's capital
expenditures and the fact that about 40% of the total of debt service
and dividends are paid to CORFO, which in the past has reinvested these
funds as equity contributions.   As under the past Loan Agreement CORFO
has again agreed to provide ENDESA with funds as necessary to complete
the project; the Guarantor, on his part, will assist CORFO in this task.
85.       Forecast balance sheets 1966 to 1972 are presented in Annex 9.
Total fixed assets during these seven years would increase from E01,542
million as of January 1, 1966 to E04,081 million or about 165%.    ENDESA's
equity would more than double during this period reaching E02,339
million and outstanding long-term debt would increase more than four
times to E0852 million causing a change in the debt/equity ratio from
15/85 to 27/73.
86.       Considering the relatively low debt it seems inappropriate
to continue with a debt limitation covenant which would make the
incurrence of any new debt contingent upon prior consultations with the
Bank.   An earnings test was therefore agreed upon during negotiations
which would allow ENDESA to incur debt on appropriate terms as long as
its earnings for a past twelve month period would cover maximum future
debt service 1.5 times.   On the basis of this ratio ENDESA would be
able to incur the debt assumed in the financing plan with a safe margin.
87.       ENDESA's present financial position offers an adequate basis
for the proposed expansion program.   However, with the amount of long-term



- 22 -
borrowir.g essentially limited to the foreign exchange cost of its
capital expenditures, ENDESA will have to reach and maintain a satis-
factory earnings position; this should be assured through the specific
commitments on tariffs in connection with the proposed loan.   CORFO will
in the future continue to contribute sizeable amounts of equity to fill
the financing gaps, although the proportion of capital expenditures fore-
cast to be financed by CORFO during the next seven years (36%) is less
burdensome than the 65% figure of the past four years.   Since availability
of these funds should not present any particular problem the financing
plan for the proposed project seems reasonable and the resulting future
financial position of ENDESA should be satisfactory.
X.   CONCLUSIONS
90.       ENDESA's expansion program for the 1966/1972 period is
satisfactory.   It should provide the additional generating, transmission
and distribution capacity needed to meet expected system load increases.
91.       The Project proposed for Bank financing, which is part of the
expansion program, is technically sound, the estimated cost is reasonable,
construction schedules are realistic and the arrangements proposed for
construction are acceptable.
92.       ENDESA's management and organization are satisfactory and it
is capable, with the proposed assistance of consultants, of constructing
the Project.   ENDESA is also capable of operating the Project
satisfactorily after it is completed.
93.       ENDESA has over the last three years achieved a remarkable
recovery from an unsatisfactory earnings level in 1962/63 (2.3% rate
of return) to an acceptable earnings position in 1965 (7.7% rate of
return) despite severe inflationary price increases during this period.
The rates of return are based on an annually revalued rate base.   The
rate of return is expected to reach 9.3% by 1972 which is satisfactory.
94.       The financing plan proposed by ENDESA is reasonable and
conservative in its basic assumptions.   The future financial position
of ENDESA should be satisfactory.
95.       The Project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$60 million
equivalent for a term of 30 years, including a grace period on amortization
of seven years corresponding to the construction period of the El Toro
Project.

ANNEX 1
FORECAST OF LOAD AND GENERATING PLANT ADDITIOIS
INTRODUCTION
ENDESA has made its load studies by geographical regions. The
Interconnected System (Regions 3, 4, 5 and a small part of Region 2, all
of which will be included by 1970) supplies over 90% of the public serv-
ice power demand of the country.
This annex will therefore be devoted principally to the Inter-
connected System with only brief comment on the other regions which are
very small.
METHODOLOGY
ENDESA has developed its load forecasts in the following manner:
1) A detailed analysis of past power consumption by classes of
customer, i.e., Residential, Industrial, Commercial, Rural, Public Light-
ing and Government offices was made and the estimated annual growth es-
tablished for each region.
2) A detailed analysis was made in each Region of the power
supplied to substations and a forecast developed on the basis of past
trends.
3) Known major new customers to be served in each region were
taken into consideration.
4) A combination of the above data was used to develop a con-
solidated forecast of power consumption for each Region.
5) In the case of the Inteconnected System, the regional fore-
casts for the 2nd and 5th Regions were developed as described above. How-
ever, for the 3rd Region, the forecast prepared by Cia Chilena de Electri-
cidad (CCE) was used as the more realistic basis for assessing future
growth in power consumption because CCE distributes almost all of the
power used in this region and has kept its own records for many years. In
the past CCE supplied about 58% of its power requirements from its own
plants but in future all increases will be obtained through bulk power
purchases from ENDESA. The 4th Region consists principally of the Concep-
cion area where past power consumption is well known and new customers are
relatively easily identified since the Government is encouraging develop-
ment in this region in which industrial power consumption is at present
70% of the whole.
Individual studies of the mining and industrial sectors were made,
and because of the Government's activity in promoting development in these
sectors, ENDESA prepared two forecasts for the 3rd and 4th Regions to take



ALNEX 1
PAGE 2
account of alternative growth rates of future industrial and mining de-
mands. The difference between these two forecasts is due principally to
the assumption, in the high forecast, that the mines and industry now
served by captive plants would not substantially increase their own pow-
er plant capacity but would obtain their future increased power require-
ments from the ENDESA system and, in the lower forecast, the assumption
that these larger customers would continue to use only about 15% of
ENDESA's output.
The separate regional forecasts were consolidated to obtain a
high and low forecast for the Interconnected System which is tabulated in
Attachment 1 and shown graphically in Attachment 2. Under the high fore-
cast, there would be an average increase in consumption of 9.1% per annum
between 1966-1970 and 9.6% between 1971-1975. Under the low forecast,
there would be a 7.8% annual growth in consumption between 1966-1970 and
8.3% between 1971-1975. Both in the high and low forecasts, the average
growth rate is lower from 1966-1970 than from 1970-1975, because the new
generating plant does not start to come into service until 1968-69 and
new contracts to supply power to the copper mines become effective about
the same time.
As a check on these forecasts, and in view of the size and
complexity of the Interconnected System, ENDESA has developed a correlation
between the use of electric power and growth in the Gross Domestic Product.
The average annual growth in power consumption so derived is 8.5%. This
is based upon a growth rate of 5.5% annually in the Gross Domestic Product
which is consistent with the Bank's report on the Chilean economy. This
is also reasonably close to the actual annual growth in power consumption
of 8% in 1961; 9.5% in 1962; 9.8% in 1963, 7% in 1964; and 5.3% in 1965,
or an overall average of 7.9%. If adjustment is made to take account of
the artifical depression of load growth caused by the severe earthquake
in 1961 and labour strikes in 1965, the adjusted average annual growth
rate in the five year period 1961-1965 would be 8.5%.
6) In order to calculate the maximum demand each year which
would correspond to the forecast of power consumption, a load factor of
0.57 was used. This is the load factor of the system at present and has
not changed substantially during the past five years. If the government's
efforts to encourage industrial growth materializes the load factor would
tend to improve.
PLANT ADDITIONS
ENDESA has made a detailed study of the capability of each of its
existing plants from 1930-1963. The actual generation in kilowatt hours
by month of each plant was tabulated from the in service date. Operating
diagrams were prepared for the Interconnected System to place each plant
under the load curve so as to make optimum use of its capability for each
season of the year. This information enabled ENDESA to determine the
system capability during the driest year and the average water year.



ANNEX 1
PAGE 3
Attachment 2 gives the past and forecast future maximum demand
for the Interconnected System, as well as the system capacity for each
year based upon the above mentioned calculations. Dry year conditions
were assumed for the hydro plants, so that the system capacity shown is
dependable.
There are five items shown on the chart:-
a) The topmost stepped line shows the generating plant in
service from 1958 to date and the forecast of new plant additions' through
1974.
b) The dots below the stepped top line from 1958 to date show
the actual maximum demand each year.
c) The dots below the stepped top line from 1965 to 1975 show
the forecast of demand and the broken line gives the plant capacity with
the largest unit out of service.
d) It will be seen that there are three lines of dots in the
forecast. The black dots represent the high forecast and the unfilled
circles represent the low forecast (already mentioned under methodology);
finally the circles with a dot in the center represent an extrapolation
of actual maximum demands during 1958-1965 and is by coincidence the 7%
per annum growth line.
e) The construction schedule for the new plant additions is
given below the demand chart.
All the proposed power plant additions for service in the
1965-1972 period are under construction. The following comments on each
installation will summarize the present status:-
1) The Rapel Hydroelectric Plant would have an ultimate capa-
city of 350 NW. The first four 70 MW units (Bank Loan 244-CH) are expected
to go into service during 1968 and the fifth 70 MW unit during 1970.
This plant was originally scheduled for service during 1965-66 but has been
delayed by floods, strikes, earthquakes and geological problems. The new
in service date of 1968 is realistic as the construction has nou reached
the final stages of completion.
2) The Bocamina Steam Plant (125 MW) would be located near the
Lota Schwager mines at Concepcion and burn the coal from these mines.
ENDESA invited international bids for this plant in August 1965 on two
bases, (i) to supply items of equipment, (ii) to offer a turnkey project
with financing. After a complete analysis of all bids received by the
closing date, April 15, 1966, with the assistance of consultants from
Europe, ENDESA has decided to accept a turnkey offer with financing. The
plant is scheduled for service in 1969. It is expected that this date
will be met by the supplier as it is a realistic estimate of the time
required to fabricate and construct the plant.

3) The El Toro Hydroelectric plant (400 I'M) is the major item
in the present program. All geological, investigations and exploratory
work on site to obtain design data have been completed. Access roads
and workers camp are about 60% complete. Tunnel adits to the main tunnel
have been drilled and work started on a section of the main tunnel and
the first shaft for the intake. Approximately 10% of the estimated invest-
ment in local currency has already been made by ENDESA. The major work
for the project would only be started when a Bank loan has been obtained
and then the work program would be reexaimined with the assitance of con-
sultants for the purpose of defining the heavy construction equipment to
be purchased. After this has been decided, a new construction schedule
would be prepared. The present tentative schedule estimates the first
200 IN will go into service in 1972 and the second 200 MW in 1973. These
dates are considered realistic but in view of the long construction period
and very large amount of underground construction it is possible that a
one or two year delay might occur. ENDESA is planning to use consultants
for construction planning and supervision which, along with the use of
heavy construction equipment, may shorten the construction period and
thereby avoid any delay.
IiS TALLED CAIPACITY AiD DE1,AND
In comparing the installed capacity line and the actual forecast
load growth curves in Attachment 2, the following points should be noted:
a) In 1965 due to prolonged strikes, system demand did not
increase substantially over 1964 and in spite of the loss by fire of a
50 NW thermal unit at the Renca Plant, there was no power shortage.
b) By June of 1966, there were indications that load growth
by the end of the year might make up for the 1965 lull, in which case
system capacity would barely meet the demand but no power restriction is
expected unless some unforeseen loss of plant occurs.
c) By 1967 the 50 MW Renca unit is expected to be back in service
and, again provided all plants can be kept in service, no power restrictions
are expected.
d) If the first four units of the Rapel plant come into service
on schedule before June 1968, then for the first time in several years
ENDESA will have sufficient capacity to meet its demands and have spare
capacity to take care of emergencies. If Rapel is delayed, 1968 will be
a difficult year and power restriction may have to be applied during the dry
season unless there is a good water year or the load growth falls signif-
icantly below the forecast.
e) The situation in 1969 is expected to be satisfactory.
f) In 1970 the 5th Rapel unit and the Bocamina plant are sched-
uled for service so that again no problem in meeting demand is anticipated
for 1970 or 1971.



ANNEX 1
PAGE 5
g)  In 1972, if the first stage (200 MW) of El Toro (400 MW)
comes into service as scheduled, there will be no problem. If a delay is
experienced, 1972 could be a difficult year and depending on the actual
load and water conditions at the time, some restrictions might occur.
However, the situation would be no worse than between 1966 and 1968. If
El Toro is delayed to 1974, then 1973 wculd be critical and power restric-
tions would be likely to occur.
h) Depending upon the actual growth in demand it would appear
from the forecast that additional power capacity after El Toro is completed
would be required by 1975 or shortly thereafter.
CONCLUS ION
In conclusion, it can be said that ENDESA'S generating plant
capacity at present is barely sufficient to meet demand with all plants in
service and provides no reserve capacity. With the addition of the plants
now under construction and the new plant proposed in the present program
ENDESA should be able to remedy the lack of generating plant capacity by
1968-69 and thereafter should be in a normal situation with adequate firm
capacity until 1975 or shortly thereafter. Should construction delays of
one or two years occur with the El Toro project there could be a difficult
year in 1972 and a critical year, almost certainly with power restrictions,
in 1973 unless intermediate smaller plant additions, such as the instal-
lation of the second 100 MW unit in the Las Ventanas steam plant, were made.
On the other hand, if load growth does not increase as antic-
ipated but follows the lower 7% curve, which practically assumes a contin-
uance of past experience and discounts all efforts by the government to
increase the Gross Domestic Product, El Toro would still be required by
1973-74 but generating plant additions beyond that time would not be
required until after 1975. The proposed program is thus flexible enough
to allow time during the construction of El Toro to take steps to remedy
any shortfall in plant capacity due to accelerated load growth or to delay
future plant construction should the load materialize more slowly.

ANNEX 2
ENDESA'S INVESTEITT PROGRAI
ENDESA's investment program and the estimates for annual capital
expenditures are as follows:
(A) Proposed Bank Project (Table 1): This table is broken down into
the individual major items of the project and into foreign ex-
change and local currency expenditures. The bulk of expenditures
occurs during the period 1966-1972, with final expenditures on
the El Toro project reaching into 1973 and 1974. The foreign
exchange expenditures would be met from the proceeds of the
proposed loan.
(B) Other construction expenditures (Table 2): The table covers all
other expenditures during the period 1966-1972 in ENDESA's various
systems, for the expansion of its distribution network, for various
miscellaneous expenditures, and for the preparation and initial
construction of future major plant additions. The foreign exchange
expenditures are partly financed by the following existing loans:
244-CH (Rapel System)
402-CH (various projects)
British credit (Chapiquina System)
Swiss credit (Chapiquina System)
Exim Bank (Antofagasta System)
German credit (Chanaral System)
Manufacturers & Hanover Trust (various projects)
Suppliers credits are assumed for the financing of the Bocamina
project. The future major plant additions will not be in service
by the end of 1972 and sizeable expenditures thereafter would have
to be assumed for their completion.
(C)  The summary (Table 2) shows the total program of annual capital
expenditures in foreign exchange and local currency for the period
1966-1972 which is also used for the forecast of sources and
applications of funds (Annex 8). Although this presentation dis-
regards the final estimated expenditures on the El Toro project
it offers all the necessary details for the analysis of a financing
plan covering the seven-year period during which this project
would be built.
All amounts shown are cash expenditures and do not include
capitalized interest.

THE PIOJECT
INTRODUCTION
The Project consists of, (i) the addition of major new generating
plants to increase the capacity of the Interconnected System by 470 MW
between 1968 and 1972; (ii) the const 'uction of a new 220 kv trunk trans-
mission system, other 220 kv transmission lines and extensions to existing
154 kv and lower voltage transmission lines;  (iii) distribution system
expansion at various locations; (iv) the providing of electrical equipment,
elevators and air conditioning for the new office building in Santiago; and
(v) various system studies and consulting services. These items, which are
described below, would be financed in part from the proposed Bank loan.
In addition to the items in the Project, ENDESA plans to add a
125 MW steam plant (Bocamina) at Concepcion and carry out needed small plant
and distribution system additions and expansions throughout its system with
funds from internally generated cash, equity contributions made by the
Governmentts Development Corporation (CORFO) and other loans and credits.
It is to be noted that during the 1968-1972 period the total
addition to generating plant in the Interconnected System will be:-
El Toro 400 N4W and 5th Rapel Unit 70 NW (proposed
Bank loan)                 470 MW
Rapel 4-70 1IN Units (Banrk loant 244-CI4)           280 .14W
Bocamina steam plant 125 Niw (Supplier credits)      125 MW
Total                                            875 MW
ENDESA's investment program for 1966-1972 is summarized in Annex 2.
GENERATING PLANT ADDITIONS
The generating plant additions included in the Project consist of
the El Toro 400 MW hydro system and the addition of a 5th 70 MW unit to the
iapel hydro system.
El Toro System
This system consists of: (1) El Toro 400 14W hydro plant, (2) the
Abanico Plant, (M) the Alto Polcura river diversion to increase water supply
to El Toro and, (4) the 220 kv transmission lines and substations to connect
the El Toro power plant to the major load centers in the 4th Region and the
220 kv trunk transmission system.

(') ML Toro 400 MW Hydro Plant
(1)  The El Toro hydro plant would be located.ih the vicinity of
Lake Laja in  the 4th Region, due east of Concepcion, shown on Map I.
Lake Laja was formed by eruptions of the volcano Antuco which
created a dam of volcanic materials where the River Laja now leaves Lake Laja,
shown in Attachment I of this Annex. The Lake has a storage capacity of
about 8,000 milXion m3 and a usable storage for purposes of regulation of
4,000 million m , which makes the El Toro and Abanico plants independent of
variations in the annual inflow into the lake. This dam has a small constaxnt
leakage which flows into River Laja about 4 km. below the dam.  In 1948
ENDESA put in service the Abanico plant (129 MW) by constructing a deep
intake and tunnel near the dam to provide a controlled water supply from
Lake Laja to augment the natural flow of the River Laja. About 11 km. below
the dam a 7.1 km. canal was built to divert the waters of the River Laja into
a penstock to utilize a head of 147 meters and supply the Abanico plant.
Since the installation of the Abanico plant in 1948, ENDESA has
obtained very complete information on the hydrology of the lake, rivers and
surrounding area, including data to predict the effect of variation in the
lake level upon the leakage flow fran below the natural dam. These stu ies
show that Lake Laja can provide an average annual usable flow of 61.6 m/s
which can be increased to 71.4 m3/s by diverting the upper course of the
River Polcura into Lake Laja, as described later in this Annex under "Polcura
Diversion".
The El Toro plant would draw its water from Lake Laja through a
deep intake (see attachments 1 and 2), similar to the Abanico intake, at
Bahia de los Machos. Since the two plants would be located parallel to one
another, the water passing through one would not be available for reuse by
the other. The head of the El Toro plant would be 562 meters compared with
147 meters at Abanico. Thus, in order to make best use of the water avail-
able a maximum would be used in El Toro, while Abanico would be operated as
a peaking plant. ENDESA plans to carry out the necessary civil works for
this purpose as described later in this Annex under "Abanico"F.
The hydrological data may be summarized as follows:
Total storage in Lake Laja about            8,000 million m3
Storage available for regulation about      4,000 million m3
Average annual usable flow from Lake Laja      61.6 m3/s
Additional annual usable flow from
Alto Polcura Diversiori                   9.8 m3/s
Total average annual usable flow from
Lake Laja                                71.4 m3/s
Average inflow into River Laja above Abanico    4.4 m3/s
Total usable flow                              75.8 m3/s

* This is only slightly more than the natural flow in the
River Laja and is required to provide the estimated peaking
capacity to be obtained from the Abanico plant.
ENDESA constructed the intake for the Abanico plant in 19h8 with
the assistance of Norwegian consultants. Since that time considerable
further research has been done on this type of intake by ENDESA and the
techniques for carrying out the work have been improved. Since the
same consultants will be assisting in the El Toro intake the work should
be accomplished without any special problem.
The intake leads into the 8.9 km. long main tunnel through the
Polcura range to an underground pressure pipe and surge tank leading into
the underground power house containing 4 x 100 MW generating units which
would utilize a head of 562 meters. The plan and profile of the
underground works are shown on Attachment 2.
The geological survey for the plant was made with the assistance
of several consultants. ENDESA's staff geologist with the collaboration
of geologists from the U.S. Geological Survey Team and U.S. AID reported
on the geology of the area. This was followed by specific examination of
the tunnel and power house location. Next the Swedish firm of ABEM
(A.B. Elektrisk Malmletning) was engaged to carry out seismic exploration
of the proposed site. Finally test borings, pits and galleries were
made to obtain as complete information as possible on the nature and
characteristics of the rock in which the construction would be made.
The Swiss firm Electrowatt was engaged to make a thorough
study of the power house and penstock location and design. After all
alternatives were studied, the proposed underground plant and pressure
pipe design was recommended as the best alternative among various
underground and surface locations and designs to meet the seismic and
geological conditions at the site. The same consultants recommended
the use of Pelton type turbines because of the size of the machine
(100 MW) and the high head of 562 meters.
The Bank engaged a consulting geologist to visit ENDESA and review
the feasibility of the plant from an engineering and geological point of
view. His report concurred in the decisions reached by ENDESA and its
consultants and considered the proposed design feasible.



ANNEX 3
Page Li.
ENDESA intends to construct the El Toro plant with its own work
force assisted by construction consultants. It has prepared construction
plans and procedures in considerable detail. The following specific steps
were taken to ensure a well organized project and a reliable cost estimate.
(1) ENDESA's staff members supervising the El Toro project were
selected for their past experience in similar work during the
construction of existing ENDESA power plants in Chile. The senior
staff are between 45 and 52 years old and have 20 years or longer
experience. The second level are between 36 and 45 years old
and average about 15 years of experience. These men have been
responsible for supervising construction of seven hydro plants
involving a total length of tunnels of over 27 km. They also
constructed the deep intake for the Abanico plant. Thus, the work
to be done in El Toro will not present any fundamentally new
problems to them.
(2) The three principal supervisors, namely, the project manager,
the chief project engineer and the tunnel construction superin-
tendent were sent on special visits to the United States, Switzer-
land, Britain, France, Sweden, Norway and Spain for seven months
to become acquainted with major tunnel works in those countries
and to study modern construction methods and the type and appli-
cation of heavy construction equipment available.
(3) Instructors were brought to Chile to conduct training courses
for foremen and workers on drilling techniques and the use of
equipment.
(4)  A general instruction course for all foremen and workmen is part
of ENDESA's normal program and is continually being carried on
with the help of consultants from the University of Chile and from
Electricite de France.
(5) In order to reinforce its own staff, ENDESA has invited several
prominent construction firms to offer consulting services and
active discussions are taking place with at least one of these
firms to provide the following services:
(a) The services in Chile of a senior construction engineer to
review the entire project and plans for its construction
to decide with ENDESA on the type and quantity of construction
equipment to be purchased; to return to Chile when the offers
for the construction equipment have been received to assist
ENDESA in selecting the best offer;  to visit Chile for a
two or three week period every 2 or 3 months, as the work
demands, to review the construction progress, procedures and
problems.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
(b)  The services of specialized technicians in Chile for the
period necessary to assist in dealing with specific problems
on the recommendation of the principal consultant or at
ENDESA's request.
(c)  The services in Chile of supervisory personnel at the
foreman level as recommended by the principal consultant.
(d)  The services of equipment operators in Chile to train
ENDESA's workmen to use the equipment in the best way
under the conditions encountered at the work site.
In addition, the firm of Electrowatt, consultants on the underground
power house and pressure shaft design, are being retained as special con-
sultants on the construction of these items. Also, the Norwegian consultants
who assisted in'the design and construction of the Abanico deep intake are
being retained for the El Toro intake.
The terms of reference for all consultants will be submitted for
Bank approval before contracts are signed.
The cost estimates made by ENDESA for El Toro are based on the
unit prices encountered in previous similar work, adjusted to reflect
cost increases. The cost of imported construction equipment and other
materials are based upon suppliers quoted prices. A detailed estimate of
quantities of material to be used, excavation, equipment and labor was
made for each section of the project on the basis of a previously prepared
detailed construction plan. The present estimate, which includes adequate
contingencies, is reasonable for the work to be carried out and is
summarized below:,

(2) The Abanico Plant
The Abanico plant is at present using an average annual flow
of 66.1 m3/s to generate 663 million kwh. This flow 's made up of about
23.9 m /s of leakage from the Lake Laja d¶m and 4.4 Xm/s of inflow into
the Laja River above the plant and 37.8 mr/s through the controlled deep
intake. Thus by reducing the flow through the intake to a minimum of
about  .6 mr-/s the total flow to the Abanico plant can be reduced to
30.9 m /s. which is the minimum required to obtain the estimated peaking
capacity from Abanico.
ENDESA proposes to construct a simple storage basin by building
a weir across the Laja River above the diversion canal to store water for
release during the peak hours of demand. Control gates will be installed
and improvements made to the diversion canal to meet the higher rates of
flow. The estimated local and foreign costs of E016,8h2.4 thousand and
US$55.2 thousand are reasonable for the work to be done.
(3) The Alto Polcura Diversion
The Alto Polcura Diversion is shown in Attachment I of this
Annex, and would divert the waters of the upper Polcura river and two
of its tributaries to increase the flow into Lake Laja and make up the
total flow required for the El Toro plant. It consists of:-
(a) The construction of a weir across the Quemazones stream
to divert the flow into a 1.4 km canal and o.64 km
tunnel leading into the Calabocillo stream.
(b) A 30 meter high 150,000 m3 earthfill dam would then be
constructed across the Calabocillo stream to create a
small reservoir.
(c) A 1.05 km canal would be constructed to connect the
discharge from the Calabocillo reservoir to a 1.5 km
tunnel to convey the water to the upper reaches of the
Polcura river.
(d) A 40 meter high 240,000 m3 earthfill dam would be
constructed across the Polcura river below the tunnel
from the Calabocillo to form a second reservoir on the
Polcura river which, in turn, would be joined to Lake
Laja by a 8.6 km tunnel.
This combination of dams, reservoirs ayd tunnels would provide
an aver3ge annual inflow into Lake Laja of 9.8 ma/s and a maximum flow
of 20 m /s. The net gain from this flow in energy generated by the El
Toro plant would be about 400 million kwh annually at an economical
incremental cost.
The hydrological and geological investigation for this scheme
was carried out by the same teams which studied the El Toro project and
are satisfactory.



ANNEY 
Page 7
Since this diversion scheme involves the construction of two
earthfill dams, ENDESA has decided to invite bids from contractors under
the Bank's Guidelines for International Bidding. It is expected that a
foreign contractor, possibly in partnership with a Chilean ccntractor
would obtain the award.
The estimate for the project was made along the same lines used
for El Toro and is reasonable. In this case the entire estimated amount
of the contractor's bid is assumed to be in US dollars and disbursable
from the loan funds. The escudo portion is to cover ENDESA's expenses for
studies, design work, legal fees and inspection of the contractor's work.
The estimated costs would be E09,822 thousand and US$18,282 thousand. The
dollar amount contains adequate contingency allowances.
(4)  The 220 KV Transmission System - 4th Region
The 220 KV Transmission and substations to transmit the El Toro
power to the load centers in the hth Region are shown in Attachment 3 and
consist of the following:-
(a) Two single circuit 220 KV lines each 100 km long would be
built from the El Toro plant to the Charrua substation
which now receives power from the Abanico plant through two
154 KV lines. This substation is the switching point from
which power in bulk will be transmitted through the new
Trunk Transmission System northward to the Santiago area.
(b) A 70 km double circuit 220 KV line would be built from the
Charrua substation to Concepcion substation now supplied
at 154 KV from the Abanico plant.
(c) The Charrua and Concepcion substations would be expanded
to receive power at 220 KV and transformers would be in-
stalled to interconnect with the existing 15h KV and 30
KV systems.
ENDESA has had previous experience in the construction of 220 KV
lines for the Rapel System, now being completed. In this connection
consultants from Italy were used to check the design and carry out tests
on the structures.
ENDESA has a network analyser and use of an electronic computer
at the University of Chile which it uses constantly to make system load,
short circuit and stability calculations and studies. The proposed new
transmission lines in the 5th Region and the Trunk Transmission system
have been carefully studied, and their electrical characteristics are satis-
factory and will not result in instability of the system. The proposed
plant additions during 1968-1972 will increase the system short circuit
capacity and some circuit breakers will have to be replaced. ENDESA has



ANNEX 3
Page 8
included this requirement in its program. The maximum short circuit
capacity on the 220 KV system will be about 2500 MVA; the new breakers
will have a rupturing capacity of 5000 MVA. The short circuit capacity
of the 154 KV and 110 KV systems is below 2000 MVA and most of the
circuit breakers have rupturing capacities of the order of 2000-2500 MVA.
The others would have to be changed.
The estimated cost given below, for the transmission lines and
substations described above have been prepared by ENDESA from detailed
lists of materials and are reliable.

Rapel System
The Rapel Hydro plant is shown on Map 2 and is located 120 km
to the southwest of Santiago. It consists of a thin arch dam and power
house with space for five 70 MW units.  This plant is under construction
and is being financed by Bank loan 24h-CH which provides for the instal-
lation of tour 70 YW units.
The plant was originally scheduled for service in 1965-66 but,
due to delays, is now scheduled for service in 1968. At the time loan
244-CH was made the installation of the 5th unit was envisaged for
1968-69. Therefore, .it is now being included in the Project. The load
forecast, detailed in Annex 1, clearly shows that the 5th lRapel unit will
be needed in 196F&-69.
In addition to the 5th unit in the Rapel plant it is necessary
to extend the 154 KV and 66 KV transmission lines and add transformers
and substations to serve the small towns betwen Rapel and Santiago which
are outside the CCE service area and which will receive power from the
Rapel plant.
The estimated cost of the works on the Rapel system are based
on manufacturer's contracted prices for imported equipment and known local
costs for similar mork now in progress. The estimate is reliable and is
summarized below:-

TRANSMISSION SYSTEM EXTENSIOiiS
(1) The Trunk Transmission System
The Interconnected System at present serves two major load
centers, Santiago and Concepcion which have generating plants in or close
to their immediate vicinity of suffinient capacitv' to meet the d



ANNEX 3
Page 10
The 154 KV transmission system which now forms the Interconnected System
transmits power to the many small towns between Santiago and Concepcion
and to the areas north and south of these principal centers. It also
serves as a tie between the various plants so that, in the event of the
failure of a generating unit, power can be brought in from other plants.
This system, which has come into being gradually as the 154 KV transmission
lines were extended over the years to connect new plants to the system and
to serve new towns, is only just adequate to meet present needs.
The introduction of the Rapel Plant (350 MW) in 1968 will make
it necessary to build a 220 KV double circuit line direct from the plant
to Santiago, shown in Attachment 3, because of the large amount of power
to be transmitted and because the existing 154 KV system is already fully
loaded.  When the El Toro plant enters service it is estimated that betweon
200 MW and 300 MW will have to be transmitted to the Santiago area and
much of this power transfer will be base load at a load factor of 55%.
The proposed 220 KV Trunk Transmission system would make it possible to
transmit these large amounts of power from the hydro plants in the south
to the Santiago area. The existing 154 KV system would be used as a
subtransmission system to serve intermediate towns between the principal
centers of Santiago and Concepcion. The 66 KV system is already being
used as the main distribution system.
ENDESA proposed to engage consultants to study the transmission
system with the view to recommending circuits and voltages to meet future
requirements and to assist in the design of the Trunk Transmission System
and the testing of the towers. The trunk transmission system would con-
sist of:
(a)  A 2h0 km double circuit 220 KV line from Charrua to
Itahue
(b) A 180 km double circuit 220 KV line from Itahue to Alto
Jahuel (Santiago)
(c) Substation extensions and stepdown transformers at the
terminal points
The cost estimate for the trunk transmission expansion is
summarized below:-

(2) Extensions to Existing Transmission Lines
The 154 KV transmission system would gradually be converted
into the subtransmission system, to be fed from the Trunk Transmission
System, and extended to serve new towns and areas. This would be a
continuous program of subtransmission expansion to meet load growth and
would include some minor extensions to lower voltage transmission lines.
ENDESA has submitted detailed descriptions, justifications and
cost estimates for these individual small extensions based upon previous
similar works.
Work to be done in the three year period (1966-69) is included
in the project and is estimated to cost E 23,589 thousand and US$1,878
thousand.

DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM EXPANSION
ENDESA is principally organized to generate power in large
quantities and transmit it in bulk to the entities which retail it to
individual consumers.  However, under its charter it is also responsible
for fostering the extension of electric service to areas of the country
where it is needed. ENDESA is therefore associated with a number of
affiliated entities, rural cooperatives and private companies which
distribute power to many small towns and rural areas throughout the country.
ENDESA constructs and owns line extensions and substations at 66 KV and
23 KV to serve these distribution systems which are operated by its
associates.
This distribution program is a continuous activity and ENDESA
has submitted a detailed list of line extensions and substations which it
proposes to construct. All these are required to meet the power demands
of the areas to be served. The cost estimates are based on detailed
lists of materials and are based on previous similar works.
The part of this program covering the period 1966-69 is included
in the project and the local costs are estimated at E° 73,288 thousand
and the foreign costs at US$1,738 thousand.

ENDESA OFFICE BUILDING
ENDESA has for several years been studying the possibility
of constructing its own office building in Santiago. At present the
staff of 1,349 employees is housed in rented office space at eight
widely separated locations in town, which causes considerable inconvenience
and loss of time. Last year, after plans were approved by consultants in
New York and Japan, ENDESA invited bids from local contractors and
started construction of an office building. The building will have
19 floors and a total floor space of about 34,000 m .
ENDESA has requested the Bank to include an amount of
US$616,000 in the proposed loan to finance the cost of imported air
conditioning equipment, elevators, and some electrical equipment for
which offers have already been received so that the cost and equiBment
is known to be satisfactory. The building will cost a total of E 29
million and US$616,000.
CONSULTANTS AND STUDIES
ENDESA has a system planning department which is continuously
studying potential power sources for future development. Partly at
the request of the Bank and partly to satisfy its own needs for specialized
technical assistance and advice ENDESA has in the past contracted and
expects to continue using the services of specialists and consultants
to assist in these system planning and development studies. ENDESA
will also use various consulting groups and firms to assist in the
construction of the proposed project. The estimated foreign exchange
costs of these services amounting to $763,000 are included in the
proposed loan.
