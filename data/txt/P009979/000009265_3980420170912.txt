1. INDIA'S ENERGY SECTOR
INDIA'S ENERGY POLICY-HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
1.01    India needs additional energy in order to power its economic growth. Coal is both the most
available and the least costly indigenous resource. Policy reforms that have liberalized other sectors of
the country's economy are now coming to the energy field: to the companies that produce coal and
electricity from coal. This chapter discusses the history of the public control of energy production, the
reforms being undertaken, the broad energy strategy being pursued and the environmental and social
impacts of mining and burning coal.
Public Sector Dominance
1.02    During the four decades before 1991, a broad consensus among the policy makers in India had
established self-reliance and the provision of cheap energy as the twin goals of India's energy sector and
made the Government the agent charged with providing the growing population's energy needs.
Executing that mandate, India devoted roughly 30 percent of its budgetary resources to the energy sector,
more than nearly every other developing country. Although public sector investment in energy is now
declining, it still accounts for about 3.2 percent of GDP, with roughly 80 percent of the total public
sector investment in energy going to expand power generation, transmission, and distribution capacity.
1.03    Initially, this public sector model achieved many of its social objectives. It provided more or less
equitable access to energy services and, by capturing economies of scale, India developed and operated a
sophisticated mid-sized energy supply system. During the 1970s and 1980s production capacity of the
coal and oil sectors nearly tripled, while installed electric power generation capacity more than
quadrupled. From 1973 to 1994, India's commercial energy production increased at a rate of about 5.8
percent a year to 171 million metric tons of oil equivalent (toe) (Table 1. 1). In the early 1 990s, however,
the pace of growth in energy production began to slow. As increases in coal production only partially
offset a sharp decline in crude oil output, production growth barely kept pace with the rising demand for
energy driven by increasing population and incomes.

1.04   The goal of self-sufficiency dictated heavy reliance on indigenous resources. Sharp increases in
indigenous oil production brought a decline in energy import dependency from 22.5% in the early 1 970s
to around 10% in the mid-1980s. Nationalization of the energy sector - including a ban for all practical
purposes on private investment - created large, publicly controlled monopolies such as Coal India Ltd.
and its seven subsidiaries, which control more than 90% of India's coal production. Almost the entire
power sector is controlled by the Central and State Governments which share responsibility for supplying
power and account, respectively, for about 26% and almost 70% of total installed generation capacity.
State-owned utilities also provide most of the distribution to consumers. Except for a few joint refining
ventures, the Government owns and manages the entire oil and gas sectors.
1.05   To meet the policy of providing cheap energy, subsidies for agricultural (about 75%) and
residential (about 22%) consumers became the rule, amounting to about US$3.7 billion in 1995-96,
roughly 1.4% of GDP. That cost is expected to reach US$ 4.3 billion in 1996-97, according to the Indian
Planning Commission. Subsidies have had a far reaching effect on the Indian economy: encouraging
uneconomic consumption of energy, undermining the efficient development of domestic energy
resources, imposing heavy financial burdens on Central and State Government budgets, exacerbating the
poor financial and economic performance of public sector enterprises, and adversely affecting the
environment.
Recent Developments
1.06   Driven by the scarcity of public funds and the rapid deterioration of energy services, the
Government began to reform the energy sector as part of the fundamental policy shift toward economic
liberalization triggered by the balance of payments crisis of early 1991. The reforms focus primarily on
rationalizing prices, liberalizing trade and attracting private resources to new areas in the power, coal,
and hydrocarbon subsectors in order to reduce the resource gap.
1.07   The State of Orissa, with support from the Bank-financed Orissa State Power Sector
Restructuring Project (Loan 4014-IN), has pioneered power sector reform by eliminating vertical
integration, inviting private participation, relying on competition where feasible, reforming tariffs, and
introducing legislation to allow the creation of an independent regulator to set tariffs and regulate
licenses. Haryana and Rajasthan are among the other states that have also recently adopted new power
sector policies.
1.08   Progress has been similarly limited in the reform of other energy subsectors. Little private
investment has materialized in the hydrocarbon sector. Government control remains tight in downstream
refining and marketing subsector, characterized by a rigid system of product supply, distribution, and
sales control and by guaranteed rates of return on investment in refining operations. Government efforts
to divest shares of public sector enterprises operating in the oil and gas sectors have also been limited.
There clearly remains much to be done. The status of coal sector reform is presented in Chapter 3.
INDIA'S COAL-BASED ENERGY STRATEGY
Resource Base and Energy Markets
1.09   Compared with other developing countries India's per capita energy use of roughly 243
kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) is low. For example, per capita energy consumption is roughly
647kgoe in China, 393kgoe in Indonesia, and 691kgoe in Brazil. Average per capita energy consumption
2



in high income countries is roughly 5168kgoe; the United States (7905kgoe) and Canada (7795kgoe)
have the highest per capita energy consumption., India emits roughly 770 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide (about 4% of global carbon dioxide emissions). On a per capita basis India's CO2 emission is
about 0.9 metric tons, compared with 12 metric tons in high income countries and 19 metric tons in the
United States.
1.10   As India's urbanization and industrialization accelerate, energy consumption is likely to rise
rapidly, requiring the rapid development of indigenous energy reserves to advance India's sustainable
economic development. With roughly 16 percent of the world's population, India's modest energy
resource base - assessed below - amounts to only 0.6 percent of global hydrocarbon reserves and six
percent of global coal reserves.
(a)    At current rates of production - around 290 million tons a year, equivalent to about 145
million tons of oil - India's coal resources (200 billion tons of which 70 billion are
proven) are large enough to meet India's commercial energy needs for the foreseeable
future. At present coal meets two thirds of India's commercial energy needs. Coal
demand is largely driven by the expansion of coal-based power generation. Coal market
prospects are discussed in Chapter 2.
(b)    Domestic crude oil production (at around 34 million toe in 1996-97) meets about 40% of
the country's oil needs. Unless major new oil fields are discovered, existing reserves
(800 million tons) will last only about 15 years. For 1996-97, the oil import bill is
estimated to have reached US$ 9-10 billion (up from US$ 6 billion in 1993-94).
Optimistic assumptions about the prospects for domestic oil supplies suggest that
indigenous supplies could reach 40 million toe by the turn of the century and decline
thereafter to 25 million toe in 2004-05 unless substantial private capital can be mobilized
for oil exploration. Given these supply prospects, if oil demand increases at the historical
rate of 5.5 percent per year, dependence on oil imports would double, making India's
balance of payments and budget vulnerable to volatile international oil markets.
(c)    Natural gas plays a relatively minor role in India's energy economy. Current domestic
production accounts for only 9% of India's commercial indigenous energy supplies and
existing reserves (765 million toe) will supply current consumers for about 20 years.
India is now considering the import of gas from international markets.
(d)    India has modest (an estimated 20 billion tons) resources of lignite, most of which are
located in the south of India. Because of the relatively low calorific content of lignite,
the demand for this fuel is restricted to the area around deposits.
(e)    The potential for generating hydroelectric power is estimated at 100,000 Megawatts
(MW); but only about 25% of this potential has been developed because of opposition
from environmental groups, resistance to resettlement of potentially affected people, and
disputes about riparian rights among states and with neighboring countries.
(f)    India's renewable energy program is making progress in wind, solar-photovoltaic,
bagasse and biogas, as well as mini-hydroelectric energy generation. As of October
1996, India's installed wind-power capacity of about 800 MW, with another 200 MW
under construction, made it the world's second largest program after the United States.
The renewable resource program is supported by the Bank Group under the Renewable
Resources Development Project (US$115 million/Cr. 2449-IN), and a grant from the
World Development Report (1 996).

Global Environment Facility (US$26 million). But while yielding encouraging and
locally significant results, renewable energy will not be able to cover India's projected
energy supply shortfall in the foreseeable future.

1.11    The Central Electricity Authority's Electric Generation Planning Analysis System (EGEAS)
indicates that coal is currently the least-cost option for base-load power generation in India. Given its
cost advantage and India's large reserves, indigenous coal is likely to long remain the most stable and
least-cost option for the bulk of India's energy needs. The comparative costs of electricity generation are
provided in Table 1.2.
1.12    Other options, such as imported coal and petroleum products, natural gas and renewables, are
supplements but not substitutes. Their development is constrained by (i) opposition to hydroelectric
power from environmental groups and project-affected people and disputes about riparian rights; (ii) the
inability of renewable energy to satisfy more than a fraction of future energy needs, except in rural areas
where conventional energy costs are high and small hydro projects, biomass and wind energy power
projects could prove viable sources; (iii) delays in power-sector reforms that have slowed realization of
savings through demand-side management; and (iv) infrastructure bottlenecks (ports, railways, roads and
pipe lines) which limit large-scale energy imports, such as gas, at least in the short and medium terms.

CHALLENGES: MITIGATING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE COAL-BASED ENERGY
STRATEGY
1.13   India's coal-based energy strategy leads to significant local and regional pollution of land, air,
and water; to long-term global climate change through the emission of greenhouse gases (primarily
carbon dioxide and methane); and, among social concerns, particularly to resettlement. Committed to
developing and burning coal, India faces an urgent challenge of reducing these adverse environmental
and social impacts.
Environmental Impact at the Project Level and at the Regional Level
1.14   India's environmental regulations and laws formally require industries to meet strict
environmental norms comparable to those in industrialized countries, but lack of institutional capacity
results in inadequate enforcement. The Bank is assisting the Ministry of Environment and Forest and
Central and State Pollution Control Boards through several operations3 to develop their institutional and
administrative capacity to plan and administer environmental policy and to implement environmental
law, including monitoring and compliance in specific, high-priority problem areas.
Social Impact at the Project Level and at the Regional Level
1.15   To address the major social impacts of project-related involuntary resettlement and the adverse
impact on surrounding communities, Coal India, during the preparation of the proposed Coal Sector
Rehabilitation Project, adopted a Rehabilitation and Resettlement Policy and prepared Rehabilitation
Action Plans and Indigenous People Development Plans, which are consistent with the Bank's relevant
policies. These mitigation efforts, however, address mainly the project-specific social issues and do not
extend to the surrounding region. Rapid development of energy-based industries in coal producing
regions such as Singrauli has created acute social and demographic problems, including a sizable in-
migration of people in search of better lives and job opportunities. These migrants are neither project-
affected people nor indigenous people eligible for assistance under a specific project. Although they may
benefit from formal and/or informal employment, their standards of living in rapidly expanding semi-
urban situations is often characterized by poor housing and poor services.
1.16   No single enterprise or lender can deal adequately with these complex problems. Existing State-
level institutions are weak. Although several studies of environmental and social effects in the Singrauli
region have been undertaken, the State Governments concerned have not yet initiated actions based on
them. A concerted effort under strong State Government leadership with the active participation of all
stakeholders (including representatives of the affected people, the major enterprises located in the region,
the local chamber of commerce, the development financial institutions, NGOs and academics) has to be
developed to solve these problems. The Bank is considering providing both financial and technical
assistance in developing and implementing required regional mitigation program in close consultation
with the Central and State Governments and other stakeholders.
3   These operations include the Industrial Pollution Control Project (Ln. 3334-IN/Cr. 2252-lN), Industrial Pollution
Prevention Project (Ln. 3780-lN/Cr. 2645-lN) and the Environmental Management Capacity Building Technical
Assistance Project (Cr. 2930-IN).

Mitigation Activities at the Global Level
1.17   Among the adverse effects of India's reliance on coal, long-term global climate change through
the emission of greenhouse gases is the most difficult to address effectively. Globally, the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) seeks to achieve "stabilization of
greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic
interference with the climate change." India is a member of UNFCCC. The Bank Group is actively
engaged in developing an environmentally friendly renewable resource program under the Bank-financed
Renewable Development Project and a grant from the Global Environmental Facility. The Bank is
presently pursuing a Global Carbon Initiative (GCI), under which the Bank proposes to assist the
development of carbon offset markets4 for climate change mitigation.
Diversification of Energy Supply Mix
1.18   In developing its energy sector, India clearly needs to look more carefully at the fuel supply mix.
Economic liberalization presents an opportunity to increase imports of environmentally friendlier fuels,
such as gas, to supplement indigenous supplies. Deregulation of energy prices and access to better
technology will ultimately improve the economics of non-conventional energy options (such as
renewables) making them viable sources of energy supplies on a commercial scale.
Energy Efficiency Improvement Through Demand Side Management (DSM)
1.19   The Bank's 1991 study of long-term issues in the power sector estimated that full
implementation of various measures to improve electricity end-use efficiency could save (theoretically)
as much as 30% of maximum demand and 20% of electrical energy over the longer term. The study also
estimated that raising electricity tariffs to long-run marginal cost levels over five years would reduce
demand for generation capacity by about 8,700 MW (about 10 percent of the planned power generation
capacity estimated for the end of the Ninth Plan). Since prices to industrial and commercial customers
are already high, and pressure to improve productivity, including more efficient use of electricity, has
increased rapidly under the Government's economic liberalization program, it is reasonable to expect
progress in this area in the coming years. India's increasingly competitive business environment should
also cause companies to pursue low-cost conservation measures more aggressively.
1.20   As long as the low and heavily subsidized residential and agricultural tariffs and relaxed bill
collection continue, however, consumers are not likely to respond in the same way as industry and
business. To realize the significant savings estimated in the 1991 Bank study, the majority of States
would have to adopt reforms like those being implemented in Orissa (para 1.07). Recognizing the
importance of the non-pricing measures of DSM, the Orissa State Power Sector Restructuring Project has
identified promising conservation measures such as load management and power-factor compensation in
industries; industrial cogeneration in sugar, chemicals and metallurgical units; vapor absorption
refrigeration in hotels and commercial offices; rewinding of motors; and municipal water pumping.
Other states are considering similar measures.
4   The UNFCCC provides for the probability of joint implementation of commitments (carbon offsets) between countries in
which case industrialized countries would be permitted to meet their emissions requirements through greenhouse gas
reduction investments in economies in transitions (EITs) and possibly also in developing countries. The joint
implementation of commitmnents are based on the fact that the marginal cost of abatement of greenhouse gas emissions
reductions is relatively higher in the OECD than in developing or ElTs.

Electricity Provision to Rural Consumers
1.21   The issue of rural electrification is of great importance to India where about two-thirds of the
population live in rural areas - many in abject poverty. Fuelwood, animal dung and agricultural residue
account for about 90% of rural energy consumption. Although rural electrification covers 84% of Indian
villages, only 27% of rural households are electrified, and supply is inadequate and unreliable. Among
options to improve the availability of energy in rural areas are extension of the main grid, distributed
generation, micro-turbine power plants, and stand-alone solar household systems. One important option
element of rural electrification would be to encourage private entrepreneurs to become energy service
providers. The options are examined under the power sector reform projects.

2. INDIA'S COAL SECTOR
DEMAND AND SUPPLY
Demand, Supply and Shortfalls
2.01   The Committee on Integrated Coal Policy (see Box 3.01) projected that coal consumption for
generating electricity - 187 million tons or two thirds of the total demand in 1995/96 - would reach 350
million tons in 2001/02 and 500 million tons five years later - nearly 70 percent of all demand. While coal
use by various industries such as cement, textiles, fertilizers, and brick kilns now amounts to 60 million tons
a year (21 percent of all consumption) and will more than double within a decade to 136 million tons, its
share of demand will actually drop while that of the power-generating industry will rise. The results shown
in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 are based on estimates of the Ministry of Power and the Ministry of Steel and show a
122 million ton gap in coal supply at the end of the Xth Plan Period (2006/07), an amount almost equal to
half of the 1991/92 supply. The extent of this supply gap, however, may be overestimated as the above
mentioned expansion of power generation capacity seems to be ambitious, given the slow progress of the
power sector reforms.
Table 2.1: Projected Coal Demand (1996/97-2006/07)

Source: Report of the Committee on Integrated Coal Policy, May 1996
2.02   The main reasons for the increasing shortfalls are that: (i) Coal India will no longer receive the
Government's budgetary support in the IXth Plan Period and cannot internally generate sufficient resources
to expand capacity as required; (ii) contributions from private sector will not be substantial until the price of
steam coal is fully deregulated and an appropriate regulatory framework is in place; and (iii) areas where
production can be increased rapidly do not have adequate transport infrastructure. It is worth noting that the
coal supply projection (2001-02) in Table 2.2 includes 13.4 million tons of additional production in the 24
mines supported under the proposed project. The demand-supply situation would be further deteriorated
unless the proposed project materializes quickly. The shortfall already affects the steel industry, which uses
36 million tons of Indian coal (13 percent of the total production) and imports about nine million more tons
of coking coal a year in order to make up for inadequate domestic supplies and to blend with domestic coal
to improve the quality of the input to coke ovens. Despite infrastructure bottlenecks, coal power plants and
cement plants also imported four million tons of coal in 1995/96, an amount that is expected to grow rapidly
as customs duties decline.

THE LEGACY OF GOVERNMENT CONTROL
2.03   The widening gap between coal production and demand in India is, ironically, in part the result of a
Government decision to nationalize almost 1,000 privately held coal mines in the early 1970s when their
output of some 78 million tons appeared to be lagging behind the needs for power generation and steel
production. Facing the risk of nationalization, the reality of unprofitable regulated prices and of Government
control of coal distribution, the mines' private owners had proved reluctant to invest actively in expanding
capacity. Similar problems, however, beset Coal India, to which the Government in 1975 transferred control
of the coking mines it nationalized in 1971 and the thermal coal producers it took over in 1973 -- 325 mines
consolidated from the original thousand. As Annex 2.1 describes in detail, Coal India has acquired control
of almost 90% of India's coal production and the Government of India has charge of almost all solid fuel
production.
2.04 During the 25 years of Government control, it has been setting the industry's prices and production
targets, approving investment budgets and programs, and deciding on the allocation of coal supplies to
major consumers and the appointment of chief executives and directors of the companies. In practice, it kept
coal prices low to avoid an inflationary ripple effect on the rest of the economy but also, bowing to powerful
trade unions, it forced the industry to accept sizable real wage increases year after year. Because of
Government control over coal distribution, moreover, Coal India sometimes had to supply coal to non-
creditworthy State Electricity Boards, whether it was paid or not.
2.05   In this highly regimented environment, Coal India had three major objectives: (i) to meet the coal
production targets of the five-year plans; (ii) to compensate for cost increases with production
improvements and cost savings; and (iii) to provide employment and social infrastructure in rural areas.
Until recently, it gave priority to meeting the demand for coal; financial considerations played a minor role.
As a result, Coal India recorded profits in just six of the 21 years since its establishment, generating a
modest up-trend in profits only for the last five years.
COAL INDIA
2.06   Coal India is the largest public sector enterprise in terms of employment and one of the world's
largest coal companies in terms of production, employing 636,000 people and producing about 250 million
tons of coal a year (1996/97 forecast). Structured as a holding company with eight subsidiaries, Coal India
has total assets of Rs180 billion (US$5.1 billion), and an equity of Rs63 billion (US$1.8 billion). In 1995/96,
its net sales were Rsl 04.1 billion (US$2.9 billion) and its profit after tax was Rs6 billion (US$168 million).
Its productivity (1.77 tons output per manshift) is low by world standards. Figure 2.1 shows the basic

Financial Flows Between Coal India and Its Subsidiaries
2.07    The financial flows between Coal India and its eight subsidiaries follow a pattern similar to that of
corporations whose operations are structured in divisions, with the central management transferring
resources from profitable subsidiaries, such as MCL, NCL and SECL to the two major loss-making
subsidiaries, ECL and BCCL. While this cross-subsidization deprives profitable subsidiaries of resources
they could use to expand operations, it has in the past drastically reduced the overall tax burden on Coal
India and its subsidiaries. To determine, regulate and manage these financial flows, Coal India uses the
following practices:
10



(a)     until recently, a retention price mechanism which authorized the Ministry of Coal to specify
the retention price applicable for each subsidiary at levels below those realized by the
profit-making subsidiaries and higher than those realized by loss-making subsidiaries.
Profit-making companies were required to contribute the excess of the realized price over
retention price to the Coal Price Regulation Account (CPRA), maintained centrally by Coal
India. The aggregate of these credits was used to settle the claims of the loss-making
subsidiaries under the scheme;
(b)     cash surpluses of profitable companies used to accelerate loan repayments of these
companies to Coal India which, in turn, used these sums to substitute, and in effect
subsidize, the debt service obligations of the loss-making subsidiaries in order to keep them
current;
(c)     allocation of Coal India's aggregate interest liability to subsidiary companies on the basis of
the proportionate investment made by Coal India in each of these subsidiaries;
(d)     current account recording of all financial transactions between Coal India and its
subsidiaries. Adjustments for CPRA or interest, as well as capital expenditure incurred by
Coal India on behalf of subsidiaries, are made through credits/debits in this account; and
(e)     issuance, upon receipt of equity capital from the Government, of equity to Coal India's
subsidiaries. The current account balance at the end of each financial year, after adjustment,
is considered as a loan.
2.08    The magnitude of financial flows between Coal India and its subsidiaries for the year ending March
1996 is summarized in Table 2.4, which highlights the substantial financial dependence of ECL and BCCL
on the other companies and the continuing investment by Coal India in ECL and BCCL at the expense of the
profit-making companies.

3. COAL SECTOR REFORM AND RESTRUCTURING OF COAL INDIA
COAL SECTOR REFORM
3.01   The foreign exchange and fiscal crisis of 1991 forced the Government to rethink the support it had
long given chronically weak public enterprises such as Coal India and, in the case of the coal industry, to set
out on a path of making it commercially and financially viable. Faced with budgetary constraints and huge
investment requirements to meet the ever increasing demand for coal, over the period of 1993-96, the
Government started to phase out its budgetary support to Coal India, lowered tariffs, gradually deregulated
pricing and distribution and opened captive mines and washeries to private ownership, so as to set the stage
for a competitive coal market (see Annex 3.1).
3.02   The framework for future reform is provided by the January 1997 Approach Paper to the Ninth Five
Year Plan and the recommendations of the Government Committee on the Integrated Coal Policy (Chari
Committee Report, see Box 3.01), the substance of which was approved by the Government on February 11,
1997. These reforms concern: (i) immediate deregulation of the price and distribution of grade-D steam
coal; (ii) full deregulation of remaining regulated coal by January 1, 2000; and (iii) opening up non-captive
undeveloped mine blocks to competitive bidding by the private sector. These substantial reforms, considered
a major departure from traditional central planning policy, triggered the appraisal of the proposed CSRP. In
light of India's short- and medium-term dependence on indigenous coal for energy and persistent pressures
on budgetary resources, it is imperative that the Government and Coal India implement reforms that would
put Indian coal operations on a commercial basis. Annex 3.1 presents the status of current and anticipated
sector reforms.
Reduction of Import Tariffs on Coal
3.03   The quantity of coal imports was restricted until they were placed under the Open General License
(OGL) category in 1993 and the tariff on coking coal was cut first (in April 1993) from 35% to 5% and then
(in February 1997) to 3%. Imports of coking coal have increased from 5.3 million tons to 9.3 million tons.
The Government also reduced the import tariff on steam coals from 85% to 35% in 1994, to 20% in July
1996 and to 10% in February 1997, resulting in an increase of imports from 3,000 tons in 1991/92 to over
four million tons in 1995/96.
Deregulation of Coal Prices and Distribution
3.04   The Colliery Control Order of 1944 that gave the Government control over coal prices and
distribution allowed the Ministry of Coal to influence Coal India's financial performance and the supply of
coal to specific consumers. Political considerations often resulted in orders to sell coal below its economic
price and to supply coal even to some of the SEBs which were unlikely to pay for it.
3.05   Having deregulated the price and distribution of coking coal and high-grade steam coals (A, B and
C grades) in March 1996, the Govemment did the same for D-grade steam coal 11 months later, ending
controls over 60% by quantity and 75% by value of Coal India's production. It further decided to fully
deregulate the remaining low grade steam coal (E, F and G) by January 1, 2000 and to allow Coal India to
revise its regulated prices every six months, beginning July 1997, based on the formulas developed by the
Bureau of Industrial Cost and Prices (BICP) in 1987, until they are deregulated. The Government has
agreed to deregulate pricing and distribution of remaining regulated low grade steam coal by January 1,
2000.

Opening the Coal Sector to Private Investors
3.06    The 1973 nationalization of coal mines banned private investment until the Government's budget
constraints and the sector's investment needs led to opening captive mines and coal washeries to private
ownership in June 1993. The Government has identified 47 steam coal mining blocks with gross reserves of
about 14 billion tons and nine coking coal mining blocks with gross reserves of about 2.8 billion tons for the
purpose of captive mining. Further, the Government has allotted 15 steam coal blocks to mainly private
power companies and five coking coal blocks to steel companies. These blocks should produce about 58
million tons per year when fully developed. In February 1997, the Government decided to open other non-
captive undeveloped mining blocks (which public enterprises, including Coal India, do not require in order
to meet current commitnents) to competitive bidding with specific selection criteria. The Government is
also considering allowing captive mines to sell surplus output to third party customers.
Improving the Regulatory Framework
3.07    The proposed IDA credit would finance a study on the rules and regulations governing the coal
industry in order to improve its regulatory framework and bring it in line with international best practice.
The draft terms of reference for this study has been prepared and finalized at negotiations. Invitation for
"expressions of interest" is a condition for effectiveness. The Government has agreed to: (i) not later than
July 31, 1999, complete the study in a manner satisfactory to the Association; (ii) not later than October
31, 1999, furnish to the Association for comments a draft timebound action plan regarding the
implementation of the study's recommendations which are feasible; and (iii) not later than December 15,
1999, begin implementation of such action plan taking into account the Association's comments and in
accordance with a timetable prepared in consultation with the Association.
Box 3.01 Recommendations of the Chari Committee and Further Policy Reform Agenda
1.  The Committee on the Integrated Coal Policy was set up under the Planning Commission's notification dated April 27, 1995 to
formulate an integrated coal policy. The Committee, chaired by Mr. K. S. R. Chari (ex-Coal Secretary) consisted of the Secretaries
of Coal, Power, Steel, Railway, the heads of Coal India, NTPC, SAIL, and an Adviser of the Planning Commission.
2. The Committee report of May 1996 made the following recommendations, adopted in substance by the Government in
February 1997:
(i)   opening up undeveloped blocks not required by the national coal companies to competitive bidding by both national and
private companies;
(ii)  immediately liberalizing coal prices of new mines* and phasing in price liberalization for existing mines; and
(iii)  setting up an appropriate regulatory framework and body.
3.  The following points discussed by the Committee were not reflected in the Government's decision taken in February 1997, but
provide important guidance for further policy reform:
(i)   liberalizing immediately all coal prices (Chairman's note);
(ii)  reviewing the holding structure of Coal India and breaking up its subsidiaries in the aftermath of the deregulation of the
coal industry and the restructuring of Coal India (Chairman's note);
(iii)  reviewing the Forest Conservation Act (Acquisition & Development) Act, 1957 and the Contract Labor (Regulation &
Abolition) Act, 1970 to address their legal and procedural constraints; and
(iv)   developing an integrated coal transportation policy.
*The Government liberalized the price of D-grade coal in addition to A,B, C grades already liberalized.

RESTRUCTURING OF COAL INDIA
3.08    The decision to put Coal India's operations on a commercial footing through comprehensive
restructuring, including financial restructuring, full corporatization of its subsidiaries, productivity
improvement measures, introduction of coal sales contracts and management training should allow Coal
India to attain long-term financial viability, provided that the above-mentioned sector reforms take rapid
effect and that the company receives the proposed loan.
Financial Restructuring of Coal India and its Subsidiaries
3.09    Financial Performance. As discussed in Chapter 2, since Coal India functioned mainly as a conduit
for massive public investmnents to expand India's coal production, its investment decisions were driven
primarily by demand and by technical and geo-mining conditions without rigorous financial scrutiny. As a
result, it has accumulated a huge portfolio of unprofitable labor-intensive mines (see Box 3.02) supported by
an elaborate system of cross-subsidization. Over time this practice severely eroded Coal India's financial
independence, sustainability and capacity to finance investments and kept its financial performance weak
for a company with total assets of US$5.1 billion. Annex 3.2 provides a detailed analysis of the financial
performance of Coal India and its subsidiaries.
3.10    Capital Restructuring. As of March 1995, Coal India owed Rs49 billion (US$1.4 billion) to the
Government, of which Rs22.3 billion (US$0.65 billion) were in the nature of unpaid arrears. This
undermined its creditworthiness and borrowing capacity and impaired its ability to finance fully its
investments. The capital structure of its subsidiaries at the end of March 1996 as shown in Table 3.1 reveals
that ECL, BCCL and MCL5 had already exhausted their ability to borrow. To alleviate this financial burden,
the Government provided the company with a financial relief package of Rs22.3 billion comprising (i) a
waiver of interest arrears; (ii) conversion of part of Coal India's repayment arrears into Preference Equity;
and (iii) a moratorium on the remaining principal arrears. In exchange for the financial relief package, Coal
India agreed to the phase out of all budgetary support. In order to restore each subsidiary's borrowing
capacity, Coal India has decided (i) to allocate this financial relief specifically to BCCL, ECL and MCL and
(ii) to strengthen their capital base through a debt-to-equity swap among its subsidiaries. Table 3.1
illustrates the effect of the combined capital restructuring on the FY1995/96 audited results, the details of
which are presented in Annex 6.1

3.11    Restructuring BCCL and ECL Coal India's losses are concentrated in BCCL and ECL, which jointly
employ around 50% of Coal -India's labor, but account for only 23% of its production (see cumulative cost
curves in Box 3.02). The success of their restructuring depends, to a large extent, on reducing labor costs,
which accounts for more than 60% of their operating costs. Under the proposed capital restructuring and
price deregulation these subsidiaries, which have been using natural attrition and the Voluntary Retirement
Scheme (VRS) to reduce the workforce, would have the necessary time to cut their labor force from 310,000
in 1996 to 256, 000 in 2002 in an orderly manner. In 1995, the Government, through the National Renewal
Fund, gave Coal India a Rsl.2 billion (US$38 million) grant to finance VRS expenditures. The Government
has agreed to take all necessary actions to obtain the relevant authorities' commitment to finance
BCCL 's and ECL 's VRS through provision of the following amounts to, inter alia, the NRF by the
following dates: (i) Rs0. 8 billion by March 31, 1998; (ii) Rsl. 6 billion by March 31, 1999; and (iii) Rsl. 6.
billion by March 31, 2000. Other restructuring measures, including the financial relief package and
productivity improvement measures, are described in Annex 6.1. As a consequence of the price deregulation
of grades which dominate the production mix of BCCL and ECL, the cross-subsidization mechanism
through CPRA (see para 2.07) has been discontinued. The proposed loan will not finance any mine projects
under BCCL and ECL.
Corporatization of Coal India and its Subsidiaries
3.12    Coal India has decided to implement a program for corporatization of its subsidiaries, with effect
from April 1, 1997. The objective is to enhance the financial independence of the subsidiaries and to
insulate the profit-making companies from the unprofitable companies. Coal India will remain a holding
company, while its subsidiaries transform into financial independent profit centers. The principles of the
corporatization program, as adopted by the Board of Directors of Coal India in March 1997, are described in
Annex 6.1. Coal India has agreed not to merge any of its subsidiaries and to cause each subsidiary not to
merge without the consent of the Bank. Coal India has also agreed to: (a) conduct allfinancial
transactions between itself and the subsidiaries, and cause the subsidiaries to conduct allfinancial
transactions among themselves, based on written contracts; (b) limit allfinancial transactions between
Box 3.02 Cumulative Cost Curves in Coal India's Mines
Figure 3.1, which shows the cumulative cost curves for thermal and coking coal in Coal India's mines, illustrates the cash cost in
relation to the average price received and the labor complement of each colliery. It indicates that the production cost per ton of 100 million
tons of coal equivalent (tce - one ton of Indian coal equals approximately 0.8 tce) of steam coal is under the average coal price (profitable
operations), while the production cost of the remaining 40 million tce of steam coal is above the average coal price (non-profitable
operations). The losses are concentrated in BCCL and ECL.

itself and the subsidiaries and cause allfinancial transactions among the subsidiaries to be limited, to
those relating to equity acquisition, loans and commitment, guarantee and service charges, which may be
levied by Coal India on the subsidiaries and other incidental transactions, which are paid within a twelve
month period; (c) not lend, or otherwise make available to any of the subsidiaries other than BCCL or
ECL, funds obtained by Coal India from external sources: (i) for a time period different from that; and
(ii) on terms more favorable than those, on which such funds shall have been so obtained by Coal India;
and (d) limit its corporate guarantees, if any, to profit-making subsidiaries. Thefollowingfinancial
covenants have been agreed: (a) Coal India shall cause BCCL and ECL to maintain a debt to total
capitalization ratio of no more than 70% during the periodfrom FY1998 through FY2000 and no more
than 60% after FY 2000; (b) Coal India maintain and cause each subsidiary other than BCCL and ECL
to maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 60%; (c) Coal India shall cause BCCL and
ECL from FY2001 to maintain a debt service ratio of at least 1.3; and (d) Coal India shall maintain and
cause each subsidiary other than BCCL, ECL and CMPDI to maintain a debt service ratio of at least 1.3.
Productivity Improvement and Safe Mining Practices
3.13   The above capital restructuring and corporatization program will be complemented by various
measures to improve labor productivity and capacity utilization and management training.
3.14 Increasing Labor Productivity. Although Coal India has gradually increased its Output per Man-
Shift (OMS) from 1.46 tons in 1992/93 to 1.77 tons in 1995/96, its labor productivity, because of a large
workforce (due to social constraints and inherent technical problems) in underground mines, is distinctly
below that of other major world coal mining companies.6 Average earnings for mine workers, who also
receive benefits such as free housing, water, electricity and medical care, are estimated to be nine times
higher than those of agricultural workers in the same region. Such generous compensation makes Coal India
one of the most attractive employers in these regions. Coal India has not been able to reduce its payroll due
to: (i) the social requirement that Coal India recruit family members of workers who die or are injured on
the job; and (ii) the obligation to employ project-affected people under their compensation scheme.
3.15   Redundant workers account to a significant degree for Coal India's weak financial performance,
particularly that of BCCL and ECL. Recognizing that this overstaffing cannot be sustained, the company's
management has used natural attrition and the Voluntary (enhanced early) Retirement Scheme to reduce its
labor force from about 673,00 in 1991 to about 636,000 in 1996. More rapid reduction, desirable from the
financial restructuring point of view, would require management to upset the balance between its economic
rationale and the protection of employment and risk industrial disputes. To avoid such disruption, Coal India
intends to limit new intake rigorously and to promote more early retirements under the VRS with the
financial support of the National Renewal Fund (NRF).
3.16   Experience in other countries has shown that coal-industry labor reduction is a costly and lengthy
process. Given the acute social and political constraints and need for orderly shrinkage, the Bank supports
Coal India's strategy. It is expected that this effort will improve labor productivity to the level of 2.24 tons
of OMS by 2001/02. Success in reducing the workforce is crucial to the turnaround of BCCL and ECL.
3.17   Improving Capacitv Utilization. Coal India's capacity utilization record, a main cause of its poor
financial performance, is low by world standards, largely because of inadequate maintenance and the lack of
spare parts which, as the performance and monitoring indicators in Annex 5.2 show, is being addressed by
specific action programs at each subsidiary. Failure to meet these targets carries severe consequences, as
6   In 1996, Coal India's Output per Man Shift (OMS) was 1.77 ton, while the United States average was 53.59 ton and United
Kingdom average was 13.36 ton.
16



outlined in Figure 6.1.1 in Annex 6.1. The programs include: (i) equipment procurement through
competitive international, rather than local, tenders; (ii) introduction of mobile canteens and workshops to
reduce idle time; (iii) opening three major training centers for operators and maintenance workers; (iv)
computerization of operating equipment and maintenance status in opencast mines; and (v) purchase of
equipment with enough spare parts for two to three years.
3.18   Safe Mining Practices. Several project mines7 suffer from shortfalls in overburden removal, which
could result in safety hazards. In consultation with the Bank, Coal India has prepared timebound action
plans for the removal of overburden arrears at each mine. The implementation of these plans will be closely
monitored during project supervision.
3.19   Retraining Managers and Introduction of Qualitv Control Circles (0CC). The success of Coal
India's effort to make its operations commercially viable and enhance its competitiveness will depend on
support from middle and upper level management. Under the project, Coal India will implement a
comprehensive management training program from March 1, 1998 through December 31, 2001, with the
help of management training institutes using curriculum to be submitted by December 31, 1997 for Bank
approval. Coal India also intends to further promote Quality Control Circles (QCC)8 to enhance productivity
and to improve coal quality.
Contractual Arrangements with Major Coal Consumers
3.20   Government regulation of coal price and distribution without contractual arrangements between
Coal India and its consumers allowed the Ministry of Coal to order Coal India to supply coal to some of the
SEBs, even if there was every indication that they could not pay. Lacking a way to measure objectively and
precisely the quality of coal delivered, Coal India and its consumers have engaged in frequent disputes that
often allowed SEBs to withhold or reduce payment for deliveries of supposedly lower quality coal. For its
part, Coal India operates without the incentive that precise quality measurement rules and the possibility of
penalties or bonuses would give it to improve coal quality by reducing the content of foreign materials.
Entering into contractual arrangements with all its major consumers by September 30, 1998, Coal India will
need to obtain contract provisions clearly specifying: (i) that payments for coal sales will be secured by
commercially acceptable financial settlement measures including advance payment in cash or Letter of
Credit ('cash and carry policy') and as per the credit terms; and (ii) a precise description of the quality of
coal to be supplied and the arrangements for independent analysis of deliveries, together with penalty and
bonus clauses.
ROAD TO FURTHER REFORM
3.21   During the policy dialogue, the Bank and the Government discussed the fundamental institutional
change of Coal India, including the break up of its holding structure and privatization of its subsidiaries. The
Bank's assessment is that the Government - whose public-enterprise reform policies do not include
privatization - is not yet ready to proceed with this stage because of a lack of consensus among such
stakeholders as Central and State Governments, Coal India and labor unions.
3.22   Although such institutional change would promote competition in the industry, the Bank has
decided not to urge it as a condition of the proposed loan. Given the balance of political forces, the current
7   Bina, Dudhichua, Jayant and Jhingurdah in NCL, Kusumunda in SECL and Sasti in WCL.
s   Quality Control Circles (QCC) is a system for achieving improvements in a great variety of corporate activities by initiating
and sustaining the active participation of groups (QCC) of workers who are actually engaged in those activities. SECL has
already introduced QCC, which helped it improve productivity and working conditions.
17



scope and timetable of the reforms are about the best that can be expected; anything more is likely to be
counterproductive. Instead, the Bank has agreed with the Government and Coal India that: (i) the financial
restructuring of Coal India, including its loss-making subsidiaries, be undertaken; and (ii) a full
corporatization program be rigidly maintained. It is the Bank's position that these programs are the
necessary steps toward the break up of the holding structure and eventual privatization. In the short term
Coal India's critical roles as the main conduit for the financial restructuring and corporatization program
and oversight implementing agency of the ESMP justify the current institutional structure. However, as the
sector liberalization and the corporatization program further advance and the restructuring of the loss
making subsidiaries is completed Coal India's relevance as a holding company would ultimately disappear.
While supporting the implementation of the CSRP, the Bank will maintain the policy dialogue with the
Government on this important institutional change.
IMPACT OF COAL SECTOR REFORM AND COAL INDIA'S RESTRUCTURING ON ENVIRONMENTAL
AND SOCIAL ISSUES
3.23   The policy framework of coal sector reform, Coal India's restructuring program including its
corporatization program, modernization investment and the technical assistance program supported by the
CSRP would have substantial positive impact on environmental and social issues discussed in Chapter 1.
3.24   The CSRP policy reforms that aim to free coal prices and distribution and to liberalize trade and
private-sector involvement in the industry would allow coal companies to set an economic (higher) price for
coal and thereby improve the efficient allocation of scarce resources. Power companies that are major
consumers of coal are also likely to raise their rates to reflect economic price of coals, contributing to the
demand-side management. Price liberalization would also permit coal producers to internalize the costs
required for coal improvement through washing or selective mining methods.
3.25   By promoting a greater role for private investors and the trade liberalization, the CSRP promotes
competition that will stimulate Coal India to improve its efficiency and coal quality to maintain its market
position. Commercial sales contracts with major clients, stipulating the precise quality of coal to be supplied
and arrangements for analysis by independent agents will also provide Coal India with an incentive to
providing a higher quality product that is lower in ash as well as more consistent in quality. Such an
improvement in quality will reduce coal-related pollution (ash, particulate, sulfur and carbon release) per
unit of heat or power generated by (a) reducing output of ash and particulate; (b) enabling power plants to
achieve greatly increased efficiency from coal supplies of constant rather than widely varying quality.
Furthermore, these coal quality improvements typically generate important cost savings, associated with
lower transportation costs and improved power plant efficiency. The Government and the Bank have also
agreed that a study to improve coal quality and the overall efficiency/environmental performance of the
coal-energy chain is to be undertaken under an on-going Environment Management Capacity Building
Technical Assistance Project (Credit 2930-IN) with the possibility of setting in motion a new Clean Coal
Technology Project under the lending program.
3.26   While specific, project-linked social and environmental issues are addressed within the ESMP, Coal
India's corporatization program and that of its subsidiaries will hold each subsidiary accountable for the full
implementation of the environmental and social mitigation activities agreed under the ESMP. The proper
implementation of ESMP will be closely supervised and safeguarded through the cross-conditionality
between the ESMP Credit and the proposed CSRP loan. Since successful resettlement is a prerequisite for
continuing Bank support of the CSRP loan, it is expected that the management of each subsidiary will give
high priority and serious attention to ESMP's proper implementation.
18



Box 3.03 Quality of Coal in India
1.     Indian steam coal, in general, is of inherently low quality (average ash content is about 30-35%). However, it has low
sulfur content, few toxic elements and high ash-fusion temperatures. Although the boilers of Indian power stations are specifically
designed to burn Indian coals, coal quality improvement is important for both economic efficiency and environmental management.
2.      There are two ways to improve coal quality: (i) coal beneficiation by washing and (ii) selective excavation. In order to
promote coal beneficiation and improved mining methods, proper incentives should equitably distribute the financial costs and
benefits of cleaner coal to both producers and consumers and impose appropriate penalties for quality below agreed levels. Price
deregulation and contractual arrangements specifying quality of coal would contribute to the creation of an incentive structure that
would promote further coal beneficiation.
3.      Since Coal India does not practice selective excavation, the CSRP would provide technical assistance (procurement of the
required equipment) for four pilot projects to test such mining under different conditions. Annex 3.3 provides a detailed analysis of
measures to improve coal quality.
19



4. THE COAL SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.01   The main project objectives are to support the market-oriented reforms India is undertaking in the
coal sector and, specifically, to provide financial and technical support to Coal India's efforts to make itself
commercially viable and self-sustaining. Underpinning India's broad drive to achieve economic growth, the
project also aims to increase domestic supplies of coal, by financing investment in the most profitable 24
opencast mines of Coal India, for the power sector and other industries until imports and production from
private investments can fill the emerging supply gap.
RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LINK TO COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
4.02   Link to Country Assistance Strategy. The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy
discussed by the Board on June 20, 1995 and the Progress Report discussed on September 5, 1996. The
strategy emphasizes continued Bank/IDA support for India on: (i) the reform of policies in key sectors of its
economy; (ii) the rationalization of energy policy, in particular the pricing policies for various energy
resources; (iii) the reform of public sector enterprises; (iv) the enhancement of the social and environmental
sustainability of the Government's investment program; and (v) improving environmental protection, by
strengthening capacity to deal with environmental issues and to enforce environmental legislation.
4.03   Consistency with the Bank's Energy Environment Strategy. The World Bank is presently in process
of preparation of a draft energy and environment strategy paper to be presented to the Board. The proposed
project is in line with current strategy which:
(a) supports energy production, conversion and consumption that is efficient, private-sector
oriented and environmentally and socially sustainable
The CSRP incorporates comprehensive policy reforms (such as price, distribution and trade
liberalization) to promote the efficient extraction and use of coal. The price liberalization allows
mining companies to adjust coal prices to economically valid levels, thus contributing to the
efficient allocation of scarce resources. This expected allocative efficiency would promote the
demand-side management of energy, because the coal price increase will be reflected in the tariff
adjustment by power companies. Price liberalization would also permit coal producers to internalize
the costs required for coal quality improvement through washing or selective mining methods.
(b) promotes implementation of efficiency and private-sector development through sectoral dialogue
and commitment-based lending operations, as underpinned by economic and sectoral analysis
By promoting a greater role for private investors and trade liberalization, the CSRP promotes
competition that will stimulate Coal India to improve its efficiency and coal quality. Commercial
coal sales contracts, to be introduced under the CSRP, stipulating the precise quality of coal to be
supplied will also provide Coal India with an incentive to providing a higher quality product. Such
an improvement in quality will reduce coal-related pollution and improve the efficiency of power
plants.
(c) promotes implementation ofsustainability through environmental and social assessment
practices prescribed in the relevant Bank operational polices
The ESMP addresses the specific, project-linked social and environmental issues. The
corporatization program of Coal India and its subsidiaries will hold each subsidiary accountable for
full implementation of the environmental and social mitigation activities agreed under the ESMP.

4.04   Rationale for the Bank's Involvement. The proposed project is a large, complex operation including
sector reforms, corporate restructuring and environmental and social mitigation activities. The sector
knowledge and experience that the Bank has accumulated through five previous lending operations with
Coal India, as well as the extensive policy dialogue on sector reforms, would allow the Bank to effectively
assist the Government and Coal India in implementing the comprehensive strategic approach which this
project requires. Given the large financing requirement and the fact that Coal India's financial health
depends upon the expeditious implementation of the proposed reforms and restructuring, only the Bank,
together with the Export-Import Bank of Japan, has the resources to finance the proposed operations.
PROJECT DESIGN
4.05   Coal India's short-term strategy seeks to improve its financial performance, making investments
without further Government support. In line with this strategy, the Bank's involvement would be limited to
investments in highly profitable and economically viable opencast mines that have no major environmental
or social problems. To minimize the investment costs and implementation period, only existing mines and
projects under implementation are eligible for Bank support.
PROJECT COMPONENTS
4.06   To meet the above project objectives, the proposed project would consist of:
(a)   Investment Component: high-return and quick-disbursing investments to maintain or
improve the profitability of the 24 existing mine subprojects listed in Annex 4. 1; and
(b)    Technical Assistance and Training Component: a study of the rules and regulations
governing the coal industry, in light of the Government's decision to open up the coal sector
to private investors, and technical assistance to support Coal India's institutional capacity
development in the project implementation and mining operations and management.
4.07   The IDA-financed Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project (Cr. 2862-IN) is being
implemented to assist Coal India in addressing environmental and social issues in the project areas.
Investment Component (US$1,364.3 million base cost)
4.08   Project Mines. The 24 project mines are opencast operations in ten coalfields under five subsidiaries
in five States in east and central India. The Bank would finance the cost of a large fleet of heavy earth-
moving equipment for replacement at 15 mines, for expansion at six mines, and for completion of
construction in progress at three mines. Because of the emphasis on quick returns, no greenfield projects are
included; the emphasis is on renewing and expanding existing opencast mines where the need for labor and
production costs are low and where implementation is relatively quick. In 2001/02, the project mines would
produce about 106 million tons of coal per year including added production of 13.4 million tons, about a
third of Coal India's output in the same year. The criteria for selecting project mines are sufficient reserves,
high productivity, short implementation period, no major environmental impacts, minimum requirement for
resettlement and a financial rate of return above 16%. In addition to providing supplies for the cement
industry, more than 85% of the planned increase in coal production is destined for use by existing power
stations or new ones under construction in westem, northwestern and southern states. Annex 4.1 lists the
project mines, indicating location, mine profile, capacity, investment requirement and financial rates of
return.
21



Technical Assistance and Training Component (US$14.0 million base cost)
4.09   The following technical assistance and training would be provided to support the sector reform
program and to strengthen Coal India's capacity to implement the project and its restructuring program. The
details of this component are presented in Annex 4.2:
(a)    Rationalization of rules and regulations of the coal industry (US$1.70 million)
(b)    Commercialization of coal sales (US$0.65 million)
(c)   Improvement of CMPDI's design practices (US$1.65 million)
(d)   Improvement in corporate financial planning and restructuring process (US$1.25 million)
(e)    Training of Coal India's managers (US$0.75 million)
(f)   Improvement of equipment utilization ratio (US$ 1.00 million)
(g)    Procurement assistance (US$5.50 million)
(h)    Coal quality improvement - mining methods (US$1.00 million);
(i)    Assistance in project supervision (included in ESMP cost); and
(j)    Studies already financed by the Project Preparation Funds (US$0.50 million).
COAL SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MITIGATION PROJECT (ESMP/CREDIT 2862-IN)
4.10   Given the social and environmental implications of the proposed project, agreement was reached in
November 1995 with the Government of India and Coal India to package its social and environmental
components as a free standing project for which IDA, in May 1996, approved a Credit of SDR 43.3 million
(US$63.0 million equivalent). Through the implementation of high-priority environmental and social
mitigation programs, the ESMP is assisting Coal India to strengthen its capacity to deal more effectively
with environmental and social issues and to make coal production environmentally and socially sustainable.
The results of environmental and social studies, the increase in staff with social and environmental expertise
and enhancements to Coal India's policies for resettlement and rehabilitation, community development and
environmental management (made by Coal India during preparation of this project to conform to the Bank
Group's Operational Directives) will affect all of its 510 mining operations; they will be tested in the mines
included under the proposed project. Details of the ESMP are available in the Staff Appraisal Report for the
project (Report No. 15405-IN).
4.11   As requested by the Executive Directors during the Board presentation of the ESMP, the Region
reported the implementation progress status of the ESMP (see Annex 4.3) to the Board on June 9, 1997,
prior to the loan negotiations of the proposed project. With some delays, Coal India has met its undertakings
under the ESMP Development Credit Agreement and put in place adequate structure and capacity for
project implementation. The major challenges facing Coal India are implementing environmental remedial
actions, internalizing a full-fledged community participation process, and developing and implementing a
viable income restoration program. It has been agreed that Coal India shall, on the date on which the
proposed loan and credit are declared effective, be in compliance with: (i) all obligations under the legal
agreements pertaining to the ESMP; and (ii) all obligations relating to environmental and social
mitigation set forth in Schedule 9 of the Loan Agreement and as also shown in Annex 4.4. It has been
agreed that the Bank may suspend all or part of the proposed loan: (i) if Coal India shall have failed to
perform any of the obligations relating to environmental and social mitigation shown in Annex 4.4; and (ii)
if the Government or Coal India shall have failed to comply with their legal obligations under the ESMP. It
has also been agreed that if the Bank determines that there is a breach of any of the obligations shown in
22



Annex 4.4 by any of Coal India's subsidiaries in respect of any one or more of the project mines, the Bank
may decide not to finance from the proceeds of the loan the portion of any contract for goods or works that
was allocated to such project mine or mines.
LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST BANK PROJECTS
4.12   The Bank has made three loans to Coal India: in 1984, a loan of US$151 million for the
development of the Dudhichua coal mine in Singrauli (Loan 2393-IN); in 1985, a loan of US$248 million
for the development of the Jharia coalfield (Loan 2498-IN); and in 1987, a loan of US$340 million for the
expansion of an opencast mine (Gevra) in the Korba coalfield, the construction of an opencast mine
(Sonepur-Bazari) in West Bengal and imports of coking coal (Loan 2796-IN). In 1992, the Board approved
a credit of US$12 million for a technical assistance project to deal with mine fires in the Jharia coalfield (Cr.
2450-IN). In May 1996, the Board approved a credit of US$63 million for the Coal Sector Environmental
and Social Mitigation Project (Cr.2862-IN). Loan 2498-IN for the Jharia Coking Coal project was closed on
December 31, 1992, Loan 2393-IN for the Dudhichua Coal project on March 31, 1993 and Loan 2796-IN
for the Coal Mining Coal Quality Improvement Project on September 30, 1995. Implementation Completion
Reports have been prepared for Loan 2393-IN, Loan 2498-IN and Loan 2796-IN and that of Loan 2393-IN
has been audited by OED.
4.13   Several lessons can be drawn from these projects:
(a)    Technical assistance greatly enhances chances of a project's being implemented properly
and on time. That the Dudhichua mine is regarded as one of the most successful mines in
the Singrauli coalfield is largely due to the considerable assistance and guidance from
expatriate mining consultants during the initial construction of the mine;
(b)    Project implementation units need to be strengthened, in particular to manage
environmental and social action programs;
(c)    Procurement under Bank-supported projects needs to be centralized and streamlined. Delays
in procurement are the main cause for delays in implementation. All procurement should be
carried out by a unit with specially trained staff to be established within Coal India on the
basis of the Bank's standard bidding documents;
(d)    Project-affected people must be informed about a project as soon as it is contemplated. Staff
trained in community relations need to keep the affected people fully informed about a
project and ensure full participation of all members of affected communities;
(e)   If resettlement is involved, consultation with regard to rehabilitation options and the choice
of resettlement sites needs to be substantially advanced before project start-up; and
(f)    Community development and rehabilitation will go a long way towards reducing
complaints and resolving existing problems; and
(g)    Environmental management needs to be built into the design of the coal mine (e.g. plans for
backfilling of overburden and reclamation of land).
ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS
4.14   Two alternative project designs were considered: a sector investment program loan without prior
identification of subprojects and a fast-disbursing policy based loan to the Government in support of
reforms in the coal sector. Experience with past projects in the coal sector have shown that delays in project
implementation are quite common. To reduce the risk that the project would fail to achieve its objectives
23



due to implementation delays, the sector investment program loan option was discarded. A fast-disbursing
policy based loan was also discarded because of India's improved balance of payment position.
PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
4.15    The total cost of the project would be about US$1.7 billion, including taxes and duties of US$238.2
million. Estimated foreign exchange requirements are about US$1.1 billion. The project cost estimates are
shown in Table 4.1 and further details are shown in Annex 4.5. The proposed operation would be supported
by a Bank loan of US$530 million to support the investment and technical assistance components and an
IDA credit of US$2 million equivalent to finance the regulatory framework study. The Export-Import Bank
of Japan is expected to provide co-financing with a loan to Coal India of US$530 million. The execution of
the Development Credit Agreement andfulfillment of all the conditions precedent to its effectiveness or to
the right of the Guarantor to make withdrawals thereunder, except only the effectiveness of the Loan
Agreement are conditions for the effectiveness of the proposed loan. The execution of the Export-Import
Bank of Japan Loan Agreement andfulfillment of all the conditions for its effectiveness, except only the
effectiveness of the Bank Loan Agreement is a condition for the effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Suppliers' credits of US$54 million will cover part of the investment costs, and Coal India will cover about
US$500 million from internally generated resources and about US$82 million from borrowings in local
capital markets. Details are shown in Table 4.2.

4.16    Proceeds of the proposed loan would be lent to Coal India for distribution as loans to five of its
subsidiary companies: Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL), Northern Coalfields
Ltd. (NCL), South Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (SECL), and Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL) at the same terms as
the Bank loan to Coal India plus service charges and guarantee fees. The execution of the subsidiary Loan
Agreements on behalf of Coal India and the participating subsidiaries is a condition for the effectiveness
of the proposed loan. Proceeds of the proposed credit would be lent to the Government of India.
Moreover, It has been agreed that if the Government shall have failed to comply with its obligations under
the Development Credit Agreement, the Bank may suspend all or part of the proposed loan.

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
IMPLEMENTATION ORGANIZATION
Implementing Agencies
5.01   While Coal India has overall responsibility, subproject implementation is the responsibility of its
subsidiaries. The technical assistance and training component will be implemented by Coal India and the
Government of India. The Ministry of Coal will be in charge of the study of the rationalization of the rules
and regulations of the coal industry.
Coal India's World Bank Projects Division
5.02   To strengthen its project implementation and monitoring capacity, Coal India has set up a World
Bank Projects Division which consists of: (i) a project implementation and monitoring cell; (ii) a
procurement cell; (iii) an economic and financial evaluation cell; and (iv) an environmental and social cell.
The division is headed by a Chief General Manager, assisted by 14 senior staff and a team of expatriate
consultants for procurement. The Chief General Manager reports the activities of the economic and financial
evaluation cell to the Director (Finance) and the activities of other cells to the Director (Technical). The
functions of each cell are as following:
(a)    The project implementation and monitoring cell is responsible for preparation of
equipment specification and procurement schedules and monitoring subproject
implementation;
(b)    The procurement cell is preparing bid packages for the goods and services in line with the
implementation schedules and will carry out all procurement activities in line with the
Bank's procurement guidelines. The Bank-financed (PPF) expatriate consultant team is
providing technical assistance.
(c)    The economic and financial evaluation cell is responsible for the financial and economic
evaluation of subprojects in line with Bank practices. It will assist in implementing the
CSRP and monitor the financial and economic performance of the subprojects; and
(d)    The environment and social cell is assisting each subsidiary in the implementation of
environment and social mitigation and mine-safety activities under the ESMP.
Implementation Plan
5.03   Taking into account Coal India's experience with similar mine projects, implementation is estimated
in five years. The implementation plan of each subproject is shown in Annex 5.1 In the past, delays in land
acquisition, governmental clearance for environment, lack of effective social and environment policies and
procedural delays in procurement of goods and services have been the main causes for slippage. Most of
these issues are now being effectively dealt with under Environment and Social Mitigation Project
(Cr.2862-lN). Bank staff, with assistance from foreign technical experts, have reviewed the mine design,
equipment configuration and the design of the bid packages and found them acceptable.
26



Monitoring and Evaluation
5.04   Considering the large number of subprojects spread over ten coalfields in five States, it has been
agreed that Coal India will maintain a project monitoring consultancy team, satisfactory to the Bank, for the
duration of the project to assist the project implementation and monitoring cell in periodic review and
assessment of the subprojects' progress in line with annual supervision plans acceptable to the Bank. The
team would visit project sites quarterly and report to Coal India and the Bank. Coal India will submit
comments based on the consultants' reports to the Bank within one month after receipt of the report.
BANK'S SUPERVISION STRATEGY
5.05   Since the Bank will be unable to carry out regular on-site supervision of each subproject, it will base
its oversight primarily on the review of the consultant team's quarterly progress report. The Bank will
concentrate its supervision efforts on: (i) supervision of major subprojects with investment costs exceeding
US$50 million each, namely Nigahi, Dudhichua, Jayant (NCL), Dipka, Kusmunda, Gevra (SECL) and
Rajrappa (CCL); (ii) the subprojects with major implementation problems identified by the supervision
consultant team; (iii) the implementation of agreed sector reforms by the Government; (iv) implementation
of the agreed financial restructuring, corporatization program and productivity improvement measures (in
particular BCCL and ECL); and (v) implementation of the technical assistance and training component.
5.06  In addition to the detailed implementation plan (Annex 5.1), performance and monitoring indicators
have been established to provide tools for monitoring the project's progress and the extent to which it is
meeting its development objectives (see Annex 5.2). It has been agreed that the Government and Coal
India will carry out a midterm review of the project before January 31, 2000 regarding the regulatory
framework study component and before June 30, 2000 regarding the investment and other technical
assistance components and thereafter implement their recommendations. An indicative supervision plan is
provided in Annex 5.3.
PROCUREMENT
5.07   The proposed loan finances the procurement of mining equipment, surface infrastructure,
telecommunication equipment and a technical assistance and training program. A summary of procurement
arrangements for all goods and services is shown in Table 5. 1, and the schedule of procurement is shown in
Annex 5.4 along with details of the procurement arrangements. The Bank and the Export and Import Bank
of Japan would finance the goods, infrastructure and services, in equal proportion, with the exception of the
regulatory study to be financed by an IDA credit of US$2 million equivalent. The total value of all elements
amounts to approximately US$1.7 billion out of which the proposed loan, together with the cofinancing loan
of the Export and Import Bank of Japan, would finance US$1,060 million.
5.08   There are 44 equipment and infrastructure packages and nine consultant contracts. There are no civil
works contracts, but four coal handling plants involving some civil works will be designed as turnkey
contracts. All of the equipment and infrastructure packages will be subjected to ICB procedures as per Bank
guidelines, and seven consultant contracts will be international requests for proposals as per Bank
guidelines. Procurement of equipment will include spare parts and components for the first three years of
operation, including float engines and major sub-assemblies which may be recommended by the
manufacturers. Consultant contracts worth US$1.8 million financed by PPF have already been procured, and
one consultant contract involving supervision common to the CSRP and the Coal Sector Environmental and
Social Mitigation Project (Cr. 2862-IN) is being procured under the ESMP. Thirteen packages of mining
equipment each valued at US$25 million or more account for 77% of all procurement values, and another 13
27



packages valued between US$7.5 and 25 million account for 14%. All equipment packages of US$5 million
and above, all technical assistance proposals (none of them valued below US$0.5 million), and all of the
turnkey contracts will be submitted to the Bank for prior review and approval before bid/proposals are let;
the rest will be submitted to post review.

Source: Bank staff estimates
N.B.F.: Not financed by the Bank or Association
5.09   Standard bidding documents, agreed between the Government of India and the Bank and further
modified to suit the coal mining industry and duly approved by the Bank, will be used for all procurement.
As to foreign and local bids for plant and equipment and for infrastructure, domestic bidders will be allowed
a margin of preference in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. Consultant services for
technical assistance (US$18.6 million) will be procured in accordance with the standard bid documents
agreed between the Government of India and the Bank/IDA and following the "Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency."
5.10   All awards of contracts for equipment over US$5 million equivalent, all turnkey contracts (coal
handling plants), and all consulting contracts - about 97% of the project procurement packages - will be
subjected to prior review by the Bank. In view of the large value of each procurement package, past Bank
experience in coal mining projects, and considering Coal India's uneven performance record, such a high
level of prior review is considered justified.
5.11   All bid documents for equipment required during the first two years (US$530 million) were
submitted to the Bank prior to loan negotiations. A General Procurement Notice covering all goods and
services was issued on April 16, 1997. Specific Procurement Notices will be issued after negotiations.
5.12   Inordinate delay involved in bid evaluation and award of contracts has marked past projects.
According to Coal India's own procedures, award of all contracts over US$700,000 have to be approved by
its Board that meets only once a month. Since the value of all the procurement packages will exceed that
limit, Coal India's Board has decided to set up a subcommittee that will meet as often as is necessary to
approve all procurement contracts under the World Bank project. This arrangement is considered
satisfactory. Coal India will review the result of the streamlined procurement procedures by September 30,
1998. If this review reveals that Coal India cannot meet the standard period of 103 days between bid
opening and contract award, Coal India will adopt further measures, satisfactory to the Bank, to address the
identified deficiency.

DISBURSEMENTS
5.13    The proposed loan of US$530 million and the proposed credit of US$2 million equivalent are
expected to be disbursed over a five-year period. Based on the assumption that the loan becomes effective
on December 31, 1997, the loan and credit are expected to be fully disbursed by April 30, 2003. While the
disbursement period of five years is substantially shorter than is indicated by the Bank's experience with
earlier coal mining projects, the advanced stage of project preparation and procurement would permit Coal
India to keep the expected disbursement schedules. The project is expected to be completed by December
31, 2002. The phasing of disbursements is shown in Table 5.2.

authorized allocation of US$25 million, equivalent to about four months of average disbursements.
Disbursements for contracts over the following limits will be on the basis of full documentation: consulting
firms - US$200,000; individual consultants - US$50,000; equipment - US$5 million; and turnkey contracts.
Disbursements for all other expenditures will be made on the basis of statement of expenditures (SOE) for
both the credit and the loan. Documentation supporting SOEs would be made available for review by Bank
supervision missions.

AUDIT
5.16   Coal India. Coal India's accounts are audited annually by the Comptroller and Auditor General of
India. The audit, normally completed before September of the following year, must be submitted to
Parliament for approval by November. Coal India's internal auditors carry out a continuous audit during the
year, while the Corporate Management Group undertakes management audits on a regular basis. These
arrangements are satisfactory. Coal India will submit to the Bank the audit report of the Special Account,
Statement of Expenditures and project account and its audited financial statements (income statements,
funds flow statement and balance sheet) and those of its subsidiaries within six months of the end of each
fiscal year. Documentation supporting SOEs would be maintained at Coal India for at least one year after
the completion of the audit for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal was made.
5.17   Government of India. Audits of the Central Account and financial statements of the project,
including a separate opinion on Statement of Expenditures would be subject to normal Government
accounting and auditing procedures which are considered satisfactory to IDA. Documentation supporting
SOEs would be maintained at the Government of India for at least one year after the completion of the audit
for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal was made. The Government will submit to the Association
the audit report of the Statement of Expenditures, if any, as well at the project account, within six months of
the end of the fiscal year.

6. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
MACRO-ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
6.01 Until the last two years, when budgetary support was sharply cut, the Government financed between
70-90% of Coal India's investments. As a result, Coal India has had to curtail orders for equipment and
shelve major expansion plans as well as investments in new mining projects; managers of many subsidiaries
have been forced to cannibalize equipment for spare parts. Unless the company gains access to substantial
external finance, our analysis shows Coal India losing significant capacity to meet projected coal demand
over the next three years. Without a major injection of financial resources - such as the proposed project's
support for mines that will produce about one third of Coal India's total output by the time the project ends,
Coal India will enter a downward spiral of declining production and profits and a diminishing capacity to
borrow (shown in Figure 6.1). Capacity constraints in ports and railroads, moreover, place a short-term
ceiling on the volume of coal that can be imported. Since a decline in coal output would quickly lead to a
drop in power generation9 and eventually, a reduction in industrial output, efforts by the Ministry of Coal
and Coal India to streamline performance and raise coal production without recourse to budget resources are
therefore critical for the success of the Government's broader economic reform program.

CORPORATE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Financial Projections
6.02   The financial model is structured to provide an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow in
current prices for a 10 year period, the base year being 1996. Proforma statements are generated for each
coal producing subsidiary. The results are consolidated to reflect the overall financial position of Coal India.
The detailed basecase projections of this analysis are presented in Annex 6.1 and summarized in Table 6.1.
6.03   Notwithstanding the financial burden of ECL and BCCL, the base-case financial model
demonstrates that Coal India as a whole can attain long-term financial viability if provided with sufficient
loan capital and if sector reforms and restructuring measures are expeditiously undertaken. The major
determinants of Coal India's financial health are an expected 8.8% annual increase rate in profits; the re-
establishment of solvency with debt to total capitalization ratios (debt/debt+net equity) remaining below
covenanted levels and debt service coverage rising fairly consistently; and operating efficiency improving
with operation ratios declining to a level of around 0.8. Figure 6.2 is used to represent these trends as well as
to outline the probable distribution of these results, in current terms, for each year over the period from 1997
9   Partly because of coal shortage, the overall energy deficit has now reached about 14 percent with peak deficit getting close to
30%. This power shortage is estimated to cost India US$2-3 billion at least, about I percent of India's GDP.
31



to 2006. Notwithstanding the wide range of outcomes, it may be concluded within 90% confidence limits
that the company will be able to:
(a)      sustain the profitable trend established from  1991 to 1996;
(b)      generate and reinvest sufficient internal resources to meet its debt obligations by
maintaining a debt service ratio of at least 1.3 and sustain a reasonable capital expenditure
program; and
(c)      improve its operating ratio from  existing levels to around the target of 0.8. This target,
however, will remain difficult to achieve as long as the excessive labor levels and operating
ratios of greater than 1.0 are maintained at ECL and BCCL. Without substantial
improvement in operational efficiencies, these operations will continue to struggle and
undermine the financial performance of Coal India.

FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS

0.6
________________ ___=  6.06   The CSRP contains a major policy component. As
preconditions for Bank support, Coal India and the
Government have taken steps to reduce the prevailing
distortions in the coal sector. The price and the distribution of coking coal, and higher grades of non-coking
coals have already been deregulated, and remaining grades will be deregulated by January 1, 2000. Duties
on coal imports have been reduced drastically. There is a firm commitment to adopt measures to improve
efficiency of operations of Coal India, including closing mines unlikely to become profitable and opening
up the sector to private investors.
6.07   The involvement of public sector in the project is justified partly on the ground that it is a very
important vehicle for promoting major reform in the coal sector and partly because coal-mining operations
generate environmental impacts and involve resettling and rehabilitating people. The satisfactory
implementation of the Coal Sector Environmental and Social Mitigation Project (ESMP) which deals with
environmental and social concerns is a pre-condition for Bank support to CSRP. Without government
involvement, much-needed policy reform would not advance, and coal sector development would be
unlikely to follow an environmentally and socially sustainable path.
Factors Favoring the Project
6.08   There are several key factors that favor the project:
(a)    Coal is the least-cost option: Based on Central Electricity Authority (CEA) planning studies,
domestic coal is the least-cost option for base-load power generation in India, with imported
33



coal and petroleum products, natural gas and renewables supplementing rather than
replacing domestic coal.
(b)    Linkages between coal mines and power plants: Most of the coal mines included in the
project would supply existing power plants and plants under construction. The location of
the power plants has been selected on the basis of CEA's least-cost planning exercise,
which takes into account all available options including imported coal. It correctly places
power plants that burn imported coal at coastal sites in the Southern region -- locations
where, because of high transportation costs, the incremental cost of imported coal is
minimal at the minimum compared to domestic coal. The liberalization of coal imports will
therefore, not change the location of relevant power plants. Given the fact that domestic
coal is less expensive than imported coal, even after adjusting for coal quality, the domestic
coal -- because of low production costs-- would remain the economic least-cost plan for
base-load power generation.
(c)    Plant specifications: Many of the coal users (mostly power plants) have equipment that is
specifically designed to utilize domestic grades of coal, and would impose large costs on
consumers if they had to reengineer in the short or medium term.
(d)    The project benefits from large sunk costs. The projects are able to generate large benefits
with incremental investments in existing facilities. Furthermore, subprojects are
characterized by investments with short gestation periods in profitable mines involving the
removal of bottlenecks to efficient and profitable operation and replacement of worn out
equipment and expansion of mining operations in mines that are performing well. Selected
from a large number of alternatives, the subprojects represent the best mines of Coal India.
Methodology and Results
6.09   The financial and economic rates of return for the core investment program were derived for each of
the 24 subprojects and for the project as a whole. Using the expected net present value (NPV) as a criteria
for acceptability, evaluation identified the subprojects that yielded non-negative NPVs at a risk adjusted
rate of discount of 16% as qualifying for Bank financing. These projects would also yield economic and
financial internal rates of returns that exceeded the opportunity cost of capital. Monte-Carlo simulation
technique was used for analyzing risks, while net present values were calculated on the basis of incremental
costs and benefit streams associated with each subproject and for the project as a whole. The assumptions
underlying the financial and economic analysis are presented in Annex 6.2.
6.10   Project Costs. The capital cost is based on Coal India's and the mission's estimates of the cost
component of each subproject. The cost estimates of equipment are based on the standard price list
published yearly by CMPDI, a compilation of information based on the latest purchases by Coal India. In
cases where no such purchases were made, budgeted prices from the suppliers formed the basis for the
estimates using FY 1996-97 as the base year. The capital cost of individual subprojects include applicable
taxes and duties and 10% physical contingency. All costs have been converted to their equivalent in 1996
US dollars.
6.11   The operating costs are based on Coal India's estimates of the operating costs for each subproject,
derived from the schedule of additional coal production, overburden removal, and deployment of the
machines and taking into account fixed and variable components of unit operating cost. The unit operating
cost estimates, i.e. cost/m3 are comparable with producing Coal India mines of similar nature. For
replacement projects, however, the variable cost/incremental operating cost are company specific and are
based on actual 1995-96 results. These costs reflect the variable costs per m in opencast mines of Coal
34



India. Interest on working capital is based on historical levels of working capital requirements equivalent to
four months operating cash expenses.
6.12   The financial costs were converted to economic costs by netting out duties and taxes, expressing the
input content at c.i.f. prices and adjusting local cost components by applying the standard conversion factor
of 0.8.
6.13   Environmental and Social costs. The project cost stream includes the environmental and social
mitigation costs (including project implementation costs) as defined in the Coal Sector Environmental and
Social Mitigation Project (ESMP). The main environmental effects identified under the ESMP include: air,
water, and noise pollution; land degradation; and over burden dumps). The main social effect identified
under the ESMP involves the resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected by the project (including
land). A total of 16, 310 persons will be affected by land acquisition during project implementation. Of
these 9,260 persons are above 18 years of age, and would be rehabilitated under the project. The
environmental and social mitigation costs of 14 of the 24 subprojects are less than 5% of total project costs.
For the project as a whole the environmental and social mitigation costs are also estimated to be under 5%
of total project costs.
6.14   Project Benefits. Financial benefits are estimated on the basis of incremental coal production valued
at prevailing prices - recently increased -- of specific grades of coal produced by the respective mines. In
case of grade E and below, the prevailing price is the administered price. On April 1, 1997 Coal India
increased prices of coal grades D, E, F, and G by 24-29% for all subsidiary companies, effectively
narrowing the difference between the economic and financial prices. The most significant impact has been
on MCL mines (producing grade F coal) and two WCL mines, viz., Durgapur and Padmapur (producing
grade E coals) where the difference between the administrative prices and economic prices has come down
to between 2% and 7%. Prior to the April 1, 1997 price adjustments economic prices were roughly 27% to
36% higher than financial prices for these mines.
6.15   Economic benefits are estimated on the basis of incremental coal production valued by using the
lower of either, first, the imported price of Australian coal (c.i.f) at selected Indian ports plus inland freight
costs to consumers, and adjusted for quality, less the freight charges for delivery of coal from mine mouth to
the same consumer, or, second, the average incremental cost (AIC), appropriately adjusted for quality,
reflecting willingness to pay. The AIC method estimates long run marginal cost (LRMC) by discounting all
incremental costs (capital and operating) to be incurred to produce the estimated additional amounts of coal
over a specified period of time, and dividing that by the discounted incremental output over that period. The
AIC was used in cases where inland freight costs from ports to consumers were significantly higher than
freight charges for delivery of coal from mine mouth to the same consumer. High transportation costs
associated with land-locked mines preclude coal produced by these mines from being treated as a tradable
commodity, especially because the quality of coal is poor. The derived economic price of steam coal
produced from the project is roughly 2% to 58% higher than the prevailing financial prices. In the case of
coking coal, which is treated as a tradable commodity, the resulting economic price comes out to between
16% and 20% higher than the prevailing financial prices.
6.16   For the economic analysis, the import parity price was used in the case of three mine projects, viz.,
Parej East, Rajrappa, and Umrer. The first two produce coking coal, while the last produces high quality
non-coking coal. Incremental output from all other mines was valued at prices based on AIC, appropriately
adjusted for heat content. The concept of pricing based on AIC was used because there is as yet no clear
evidence of willingness to pay through a more market-determined pricing mechanism. The administered
prices are low and distorted; while the recent price movements reflect the coal industry's transition, it will
be a while before prices reach equilibrium.

6.17    Results, The price assumptions used in the financial and economic analysis and the base-case results
are contained in Table 6.2 . Detailed results are in Annex 6.2. They show that investments for each of the 24
mines included in the proposed project yielded positive net present value at 16% discount rate and carried
financial and economic rates of return in excess of 16%. The expected economic and financial NPVs of the
overall project, at 16% discount rate, are US$1,634 million and US$945 million respectively. The main
reason for the higher economic NPV vis-ia-vis the financial NPV relates to the price assumptions used in the
financial and economic analysis. Financial prices of coal are less than their economic value (discussed
above), suggesting the prevalence of distortions in the pricing of coal.

6.18  Impact of Demand adjustment to higher prices. A separate analysis observes changes in the overall
project benefit stream as coal demand adjusts to increases in prices - from financial to economic levels. A
medium-term price elasticity of coal demand of -1 was used. Results show that the economic NPVs, at 16%
discount rate are reduced by US$51 million (to US$1,583 million).
6.19  Impact of environmental and social mitigation costs. Results show that internalizing the
environmental and social mitigation costs in the economic analysis only marginally affects the economic
costs of coal production, and therefore the economic viability of the project. Because of the high economic
rates of return, the project could absorb additional environmental and social costs and still remain
economically viable.
Risk Analysis
6.20   The financial and economic returns of the proposed investment program are subject to several
uncertainties surrounding key variables - price, project implementation, capital and variable costs, and
production. Based on the available information, a probability distribution for each of the variables was
selected and a Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to generate a range of likely values. This simulation
showed that investments for each of the 24 mines included in the program yielded positive economic and
financial net present value at 16% discount rate after adjusting the opportunity cost of capital for the
multiple and project-specific risks. The project as a whole yielded positive expected financial NPV (risk
adjusted) of US$669 million, at 16% discount rate, and expected risk-adjusted economic NPV of US$1,282
million at the same discount rate. The Nigahi coal mine project is the only case where the risk adjusted
financial NPV, at 16% discount rate, is break even. This project is justified on the basis of guarantees given
by NTPC to pay a price that would enable Nigahi coal producers to earn a 16% financial rate of return at
85% capacity utilization. Assuming that NTPC fulfills its agreement, the financial viability of Nigahi is
contingent on the fact that its capacity utilization, now 92%, will not slip below 85%. Experts estimate that
new imported equipment made available under the project will allow further improvement in capacity
utilization.
6.21   The possible financial internal rates of return, and net present values, and the likelihood of
achieving them are presented in Annex 6.2. The Annex also summarizes the details of the probability
distributions for different variables and the rationale for selecting them.
FISCAL IMPACTS
6.22   Although Government subsidy to Coal India has been eliminated, some Government support still
flows in the form of loan. This project will not only allow Coal India to wean itself from public budgetary
resources and mobilize resources on its own, but even to become a viable source of revenue. It is estimated
that this operation will result in a net flow to the Government of about Rs3O billion (US$860 million) over
the next ten years in nominal terms. Additionally, equipment purchases and coal sales under the project are
estimated to generate revenue for the Government of up to Rs85 billion (US$2.4 billion) over the samne
period.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
6.23   The higher economic returns vis-a-vis financial returns suggest the prevalence of policy distortions
mainly in the pricing of coal which have the effect of taxing coal producers with a tax that varies across
different qualities of coal. The main beneficiaries are coal users, mainly electric power producers, i.e., the
state electricity boards (SEBs), and industries. Although, recent price increases have reduced distortions in
37



the pricing of coal, further steps are needed to eliminate the remaining distortions and narrow the difference
between the financial and economic rates of return.
IMPACT ON THE POOR
6.24   Although the project is not directly targeted to the poor, it would help them indirectly by freeing up
public resources for higher priority social expenditures and by accelerating economic growth through
increased coal supplies to key power and industrial sectors.
PROJECT BENEFITS
6.25   In fostering coal industry reform by the Government and Coal India, World Bank support would
(a)    significantly reduce the risk of lost momentum due to inadequate financial resources;
(b)    further promote the critical deregulation of price and distribution controls and the opening
of the sector to private investors;
(c)    further facilitate the transformation of Coal India through technical and financial support
into a commercially viable and financially self-sustaining coal company;
(d)    safeguard in the short term the Government's broader economic reform effort by reducing
the risk of a decline in indigenous capacity to supply the coal needs of the power sector and
other industries until imports and production from private investments can fill the emerging
supply gap;
(e)   lend much-needed outside support to coal industry reforms by helping, inter alia, to attract
financing from bilateral donors; and
(f)    contribute to improving coal quality by assisting Coal India to introduce selective
excavation methods and to develop coal supply contracts that reward providers of better
quality coals and penalize suppliers of lower quality.
PROJECT RISKS
6.26   The proposed project faces three major risks: delays in implementing sector reforms, implementing
the ESMP and in restructuring BCCL and ECL. These three concerns are discussed separately below.
Delays in Implementing Sector Reforms
6.27   Although the Government, by its actions, has clearly indicated a strong resolve to proceed with coal
sector reform, some of the reform measures raise sensitive Central-State govermment issues, and some
politicians and labor unions could resist opening the sector to private investors. Searching for consensus on
these issues, the Government could temporarily slow the pace of the reforms. The timing of the full
liberalization of coal prices could also be delayed if the SEBs were unable to improve their financial
performance as a result of slow progress in the power sector reforms. Swift Government action to amend the
laws in order to open up all undeveloped mines to private participation should preclude major delay in
establishing the required legal framework, but actual private entry could be held up by the absence of clear,
transparent procedures -unhindered by red tape -- to select licensees. These potential obstacles would not
fundamentally affect either the financial and economic viability of the CSRP investment or the financial
performance of Coal India. India's supply-demand gap of coal, however, would rise sharply if private
investment is delayed. In such a case either energy imports would increase or, most probably, energy
shortages would occur. Given India's reduced budget resources and the large investments needed to meet
38



the steadily increasing demand for coal, the reforms should continue without major delays in the medium
and long term.
Delays in ESMP Implementation
6.28   Coal India is implementing with diligence the Environmental and Social Mitigation Project.
However, CSRP is not totally free from the risk that the resettlement of project-affected people would not be
implemented in a timely manner or - in the worst case facing 14 of 24 mines -- not implemented at all. If
project-affected people refuse to move to the resettlement sites. In such a situation, Coal India would be
obliged either to change the mining design and plan to avoid existing settlements while waiting the
completion of the resettlement or to shift activities to other mining areas which would yield lower financial
and economic net present value than the original subprojects. Coal India and its subsidiaries lack adequate
experience in the implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans and even more so, of the Indigenous
Peoples Development Plans which are instruments new to Coal India. Beyond the agreements under the
ESMP, Coal India has agreed to reinforce its capacity to deal with the social issues by significantly
increasing its use of outside experts, appointing additional resettlement and rehabilitation/community
development staff and reinforcing their training. The economic rehabilitation of project-affected people is
the most difficult component of the Rehabilitation Action Plans. Assessment of progress of this component
will be undertaken by an independent monitoring agency, review panel and supervision team. Under the
supervision of the ESMP, the Bank is paying special attention to this component, where NGOs should help
in candidly judging progress or its absence, and where, if required, reinforcement measures or alternative
approaches would be proposed in a timely manner.
Delays in Restructuring BCCL and ECL
6.29.  Provided that sector reforms and restructuring go ahead expeditiously and that it receives the
proposed loan, Coal India as a whole can attain long-ternn financial viability. Further consolidating their
financial positions, its profitable subsidiaries will generate sufficient internal resources to meet Coal India's
debt obligation and maintain sustainable growth. However, the outlook for BCCL and ECL, where the
success of restructuring depends on reducing surplus labor, is highly uncertain. The magnitude of the social
constraint on their progress can be gauged by the fact that more than 1.5 million people -- assuming an
average family size of five - depend on their economic activities. In addition, mining operations in remote
areas provide primary job opportunities and most of the social infrastructure (housing, schools, hospitals,
and water.) Experience in other countries has shown that a labor retrenchment program in the coal industry
is a costly and lengthy process.
6.30   The pace of the restructuring of these subsidiaries will be constrained by their capacity to absorb
adverse social impacts as well as that of the community and the Central and local governments. If they can
reduce the labor beyond the level of the natural attrition through Voluntary Retirement Schemes, both
BCCL and ECL should be able to turn around in five to six years. CIL and its two subsidiaries have chosen
the proposed labor reduction plan based on a realistic assessment of their absorptive capacity, but if slow
implementation of that plan or continued low capacity utilization ratio delay the turnaround, Coal India's
agreed, "fire wall" corporatization program will effectively insulate its profitable subsidiaries from BCCL
and ECL and their weak financial position. If the turnaround of these two companies is substantially
delayed, the Government would either use dividend revenues from Coal India to cover their financial losses
or take the hard decision to close these companies according to the Bureau of Industrial and Financial
Restructuring (BIFR) rules. Further deterioration carries the risk that Coal India would increase its dividend
payout ratio by depriving profitable subsidiaries of resources they need for growth. In any case, the
proposed loan will not finance any investment in these two subsidiaries.

Annex 2.1
Page 1 of 2
ANNEX 2.1 HISTORY OF COAL INDUSTRY IN INDIA
1.    Modem coal mining in India started nearly 200 years ago in Ranigunj coal field, about 120 miles
west of Calcutta. Coal mining gradually spread to other parts of India as the railway networks developed.
By 1900, almost 80% of the country's coal production of six million tons came from Jharia and Ranigunj
coal fields. The principal consumers were the Calcutta based industries and shipping bunkers and the
railways operating from Calcutta. Imported coal from the United Kingdom and South Africa was cheaper
on the west coast. The two World Wars gave boosts to Indian production as imports from distant
countries became uncertain. Production rose to 22 million tons at the end of the First World War and,
after suffering during the depression, climbed to 26 million tons at the end of Second World War. The
country suffered severely from a shortage of coal during the post war development period.
2.    During the 1950's and 1960's (the post-independence period) coal production could not grow at
more 2-3% per year due to infrastructure problems. In addition, the industry was severely constrained by
Government intervention, which began during the Second World War and continued unabated long after
the war emergency ended. Increasing production to meet the war time needs left many of the mines
severely depleted of new development leading to slaughter mining, which endangered the safety of the
mine and its workers.
3.    Until the early 1970's coal production was mostly in the hands of privately owned mining
companies. Selective mining of easily accessible high quality coal and the availability of inexpensive
labor attracted a large number of small investors. Apart from the usual arrangements that entitled the
mining lessees to operate in certain areas, neither the State governments nor the Government of India
exercised any control over the welfare of the industry. With the Government program of
industrialization, the growth of coal based power generation and the expansion of the steel industry, the
Government became concerned about the willingness and the ability of the large number of small private
owners to invest in their operations in order to meet the projected growth in demand.
4.    Though the country was going through an acute shortage of coal, for decades the threat of
nationalization kept private mine owners from making any new investments to expand production.
Mining equipment which was severely overused during the war was not replaced. In addition, coal
prices, which were set by the Government at levels that were barely remunerative or sufficient to cover
the input costs, provided little incentive for the infusion of fresh capital. The resulting decline in
investments and mechanization led to a drop in productivity and squeeze in profit; this in turn
encouraged mine owners to cut corners. The results were appalling labor conditions and a disregard for
sound mining practices in favor of short term profits.
5.    These problems were compounded by the Government's policy of imposing state control on
further development of power, steel, coal and other sectors which it considered core parts of the
economy. Legislation restricting the private sector from opening new mines outside their existing
leaseholds was passed. A new Government owned coal mining company was set up for further expansion
of coal production. Though coal price regulation was temporarily withdrawn in 1967, the Indian
Railways, which were the largest single consumer at that time, dictated the base price increase. The
increase always fell short of cost escalations and led to unscrupulous mine owners not paying proper
wages and welfare benefits to their workers. Many well intentioned welfare and safety laws remained
only on paper, while the mine workers continued to be deprived of full and fair wages and benefits.
6.    In 1971, to deal with the deteriorating situation, the Government of India took over the
management of all mines producing coking coal, and in 1973, all mines producing thermal coal. These



Annex 2.1
Page 2 of 2
were formally nationalized during the next two years. The ownership and management of all coking coal
mines in Jharia coalfield feeding the steel plants and other metallurgical industries were placed under the
Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), Dhanbad, and this company was placed under the overall control
of the Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL). The other mines were placed under the Coal Mines Authority
Ltd., with its headquarters in Calcutta. The Government did not nationalize the coking coal mines captive
to steel plants of Tata Iron and Steel Company, but those belonging to Indian Iron and Steel Company
were later nationalized as a part of the steel plant itself. The Government also took interest in the State
owned Singareni Collieries Co. Ltd. in Andhra Pradesh and started financing its large scale expansion
program.
7.    In 1975, the Government consolidated control over the coal industry by transferring the
ownership and management of all nationalized coal mines to the newly established Coal India Ltd.,
headquartered in Calcutta. Today through its subsidiaries, Coal India controls almost 90% of the
country's total coal production of 288 million tons. Lignite production, which amounts to about 19
million tons comes from Government-owned Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. in Tamil Nadu, an
integrated producer of lignite, power and fertilizer. A small quantity of lignite is also produced by the
Gujarat State Mineral Development Corporation. These steps have ensured that the Government is in
charge of almost all solid fuel production in India.

ANNEX 2.2 COAL INDIA
1.    Coal India was established as a Government-owned private limited company, under the Indian
Companies Act, in 1975. It is the largest public sector enterprise in terms of employment and one of the
world's largest coal company in terms of production. It currently employs 636,000 people and produces
about 250 million tons of coal a year. It is structured as a holding company with eight subsidiaries:
Bharat Coking Coal Ltd. (BCCL), Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), Eastern Coalfields Ltd. (ECL),
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL), Northern Coalfields Ltd. (NCL), South Eastern Coalfields Ltd.
(SECL), Western Coalfields Ltd. (WCL), and the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute Ltd.
(CMPDI). All of these except CMPDI are production companies. Coal India's headquarters is located in
Calcutta, and they maintain offices in almost all State capitals. It has a staff of 1,600 and an annual
budget of Rsl.8 billion (US$60 million). Coal India has total assets of US$5 billion, an equity of US$1.8
billion, and has achieved modest profits since 1990. In 1995/96, its net sales were Rs104.4 billion
(US$2.9 billion) and its profit after tax was Rs6 billion (US$168 million).
Coal India's Function, Organization and Management
2.    Important management decisions are taken by a Board of Directors, which consists of the
Chairman of Coal India, three directors (Director (Technical), Director (Finance) and Director
(Personnel)), two senior civil servants from the Ministry of Coal, one member each from the Railway
Board and the Central Electricity Authority, one or two Managing Directors from the subsidiaries, and
one or two well known management experts. (Figure 2.1 shows the basic organizational structure of Coal
India and its subsidiaries. Board members are selected by the Government and appointed by the
President of India. Coal India's main functions are to:
(a)    advise the Government on policy matters related to the coal industry, the demand for
coal, the investment program for the coal industry, coal production targets, and the
implementation of the coal pricing policy;
(b)    prepare and implement a long-term corporate policy, annual corporate production plans
and budgets;
(c)    oversee the operations of the subsidiaries, control inter company cash flows, and
administer the investment fund;
(d)    negotiate a national wage structure for coal miners with trade unions and liaise with
them to ensure harmonious industrial relations;
(e)    negotiate coal supply contracts with major consumers, such as State Electricity Boards
and steel plants, monitor the distribution of coal and coal products throughout the
country, and liaise with State Governments and coal consumers' associations;
(f)   recruit, train and manage cadres of all executive staff;
(g)    approve investment projects valued at Rs200-500 million (US$6-16 million) and review
and recommend others exceeding these amounts for the Government's approval;
(h)    monitor and review the progress of all projects with investment exceeding Rs200 million
(US$6 million) and submit progress reports to the Ministry of Project Implementation
for projects with investment of Rsl billion (US$30 million) and above;
(i)    procure all goods and services from abroad, some specified heavy earth-moving
equipment and other goods in short supply within the country;



Annex 2.2
Page 2 of 5
(j)    negotiate World Bank and bilateral foreign collaboration project loans and monitor their
implementation;
(k)    plan research and development activities for the coal industry and promote introduction
of new technology; and
(1)    manage operations of mines in North East Coalfields and Dankuni Coal Complex near
Calcutta which produces smokeless fuel and coal gas.
Roles of the Subsidiaries
3.    Each subsidiary is managed by a Board of Directors with a Chairman-cum-Managing Director
(who reports to Chairman, Coal India) as the Chief Executive. He is assisted by four full-time and four
or five part time Directors that deal with production-related matters, the implementation of new projects,
finance matters and personnel issues. The 'functional' directors report to the respective Coal India
Directors on subject-related issues, but are placed administratively under the Chairman-cum-Managing
Directors. The part-time directors represent the Ministry of Coal, the local railways, local State
Electricity Boards (SEBs) and Coal India, and provide advice on management-related issues. All
directors are nominated by the Government. The main functions of the subsidiary companies are to:
(a)    manage all operations under their control and conduct mining operations with due regard
to safety, conservation of resources, and workers' health and welfare;
(b)    sell coal and realize proceeds, royalties, cesses and taxes on behalf of the Government;
(c)    control service conditions and manage workers and non-executive cadres;
(d)    acquire land and attend to resettlement and rehabilitation and environmental issues;
(e)   liaise with local trade unions to maintain harmonious industrial relations;
(f)   liaise with representatives of State Governments, railways and SEBs;
(g)    approve projects with a capital investment up to Rs200 million (US$6 million), and
implement, monitor and review the progress of all investment projects and submit
periodic reports to Coal India;
(h)    effect payment of wages and salaries to all employees and the bills of contractors; and
(i)    procure all capital and consumable goods (other than those procured by Coal India) and
supervise their efficient distribution and storage and utilization.
4.     Subsidiary companies have three levels of management: Corporate level, Area level and Mine
level. Each company is divided into a number of Areas and each Area has a number of operating mines
and projects under implementation. The number of Areas in a company varies depending on the number
of mines or project units, the type and complexity of the operations, and the manpower deployed. Larger
mines or projects are often treated as an Area.
5.    Area Management. Each Area is managed by an Area General Manager, usually a mining
engineer with about 25 years of operational experience. He is assisted by a team of 10-12 engineers and
other professional staff. They are responsible for the supervision and monitoring of all activities at the
mine or project level. The Area office is also in charge of land acquisition and the implementation of
Coal India's policy for resettlement and rehabilitation as well as its corporate environmental policy. The
Area General Manager reports to the functional directors on the respective functions, but
administratively he is answerable to the Managing Director of the subsidiary company.



Annex 2.2
Page 3 of 5
6.    Mine Management. Production mines and mines under construction are managed by Mine
Managers, usually mining engineers with 15-20 years experience. The Mine Manager is the linchpin for
all production and project implementation activities. Each manager is assisted by a Pit Manager and a
number of assistant and undermanagers, all mining engineers. Their number is determined by Coal
Mines Regulations and varies with the volume of production and the complexity of the operations. In
addition, each Mine Manager is assisted by a number of other professionals in engineering, accounts,
implementation of environmental and rehabilitation action plans and labor welfare measures.
Project Implementation Arrangement at Subsidiaries
7.    Physical implementation of the projects is the responsibility of the subsidiaries. The Director
(Planning and Project) at each subsidiary is in charge of all projects from planning to implementation.
He is assisted by senior managers and a Mine Manager. These managers all have 15-20 years experience.
The Mine Manager is assisted by a team of staff drawn from mining, excavating, electrical and
mechanical, civil engineering, environment, social welfare and other disciplines. The office of the Area
General Manager and the Chief General Manager for Planning and Projects (at the headquarters of the
subsidiary) monitor the implementation of projects. The Project Monitoring Cells at Area offices are
manned by two or three senior level engineers who visit the projects and assist in organizing resources.
Operations
8.    Coal India has 510 mines, 16 coking coal washeries and several large workshops. Production
totals about 250 million tons per year. Activities are spread over 18 coalfields in eight States in eastern
and central India. The mines are regionally grouped together under seven subsidiaries. The operations of
each subsidiary are outlined in the following paragraphs and detailed in Tables 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.
9.    BCCL was created after the nationalization of coking coal mines in 1973 and was formerly a
subsidiary of the Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL), a wholly owned Government of India enterprise.
It was transferred to Coal India in 1975 along with four coking coal washeries belonging to SAIL. With
its headquarters at Dhanbad, Bihar, BCCL operates 93 mines (27.8 million tons) and nine coking coal
washeries in Jharia and Mugma coalfields of eastern Bihar. The underground mines in Jharia are old and
suffer from water and fire hazards. An IDA financed project, Jharia Mine Fire Control Technical
Assistance Project (Cr. 2450-1N), is already studying the fire problems. Underground mines are old and
not economical but they are the sole source of prime coking coal in India. After nationalization, a few
mechanized surface mines operating in lower quality steam coal were opened. The overall productivity
and efficiency are very poor, the company has not made any profit since its inception. It is now placed
under BIFR, equivalent to Chapter 11 provisions of United States bankruptcy laws. With the recent
deregulation of coking coal prices, the losses are likely to come down.
10.   CCL, with its headquarters in Ranchi, Bihar, is the successor to the former Government owned
National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC). CCL operates 74 mines (30.8 million tons) and five
coking coal washeries (one more is under construction) in the Chotanagpur region, but most of the
production (88%) comes from surface mines. The company is the major source of medium coking coal in
India. The productivity of underground mines and many of the surface mines is low, but because of the
high priced coking coal, the company has been making marginal profits or losses. With the recent
deregulation of coking coal prices, the profitability of the company is expected to improve.
11.   ECL, with its headquarters at Sanctoria, 120 miles north-west of Calcutta, is the biggest
subsidiary in terms of employment. It has 127 mines (production 27.8 million tons) mostly located in the



Annex 2.2
Page 4 of 5
Ranigunj coalfield of West Bengal and the adjacent coalfields of eastern Bihar. It has some of the oldest
and the deepest mines in the country, which are the sole source of low ash high calorific value coal in
India. The company produces a small quantity of semi-coking coal used by the steel plants for blending.
The low ash steam coal is used for pulverized fuel injection in blast furnaces. The productivity and
efficiency of underground mines are very poor; ECL has not recorded any profit during the last 20 years.
A few opencast mines begun after nationalization show moderate profits, but overall the company
sustains heavy losses and is subsidized by the profit making companies. With the recent deregulation of
prices of higher grades of steam coal and semi-coking coals, the losses are expected to reduce.
12.   MCL is the youngest coal company. It was carved out of CCL and SECL in 1992. It operates 20
mines (32.7 million tons) in Talcher and lb Valley coalfields with its headquarters at Sambalpur, Orissa.
MCL's underground mines are old and suffer from low production and productivity. Most of MCL's
production (94%) comes from highly mechanized opencast mines operating in very thick seams close to
the surface. The coal produced from these mines is inferior in quality and suitable only for power
generation. The lb Valley mines (on the east-west railway system from Calcutta to western India) are a
major source of power grade coal for the western regions. Similarly, Talcher mines located closed to the
east coast rail system from Calcutta to South India are the main source of steam coal for consumers in
the south. Though the availability and utilization of opencast equipment is low by international
standards, the company makes a profit due to very favorable working conditions at its surface mines.
13.   NCL has its headquarters in Singrauli and has ten large highly mechanized opencast mines (35.2
million tons) and a steam coal washery in a Singrauli coalfield. The coalfield extends over the border of
northeast Madhya Pradesh and southeast Uttar Pradesh. The company was carved out of CCL in 1985
with the mines formerly owned by NCDC. Most of the coal is medium to low quality, suitable for
cement and power industries. It is the primary source of coal for the industries in north, northwest and
west India. It has the only steam coal washery in India but the plant has not been commissioned due to
the absence of any contract for the sale of washed coal. The company operates a large fleet of opencast
equipment but availability and utilization are low by international standards. Despite that, because of the
favorable working conditions and a high degree of mechanization, the company makes good profit.
14.   SECL has its headquarters in Bilaspur, Madhya Pradesh and is the largest subsidiary company in
terms of production (53.2 million tons). It was carved out of CCL and WCL in 1985 and consists of
underground and opencast mines formerly owned by NCDC. Its 91 mines are spread over ten coalfields
in eastern Madhya Pradesh. These coalfields are the only major sources of good quality steam coal
outside of ECL. The geological conditions are favorable, so the productivity of underground mines is
better than that of the other companies, and they yield marginal profit. But the majority (70%) of the
production comes from highly mechanized opencast mines which produce lower quality coal. SECL is an
important source of coal supply to the cement and power industries in the center, west and northwest of
India. Since the opencast mines are highly profitable the company yields a profit. With the recent
deregulation of superior grades of coal, the profitability of the underground mines is expected to
improve.
15.   WCL has its headquarters at Nagpur, in the eastern Maharashtra, about 450 miles east of
Mumbai and operates 88 mines (29 million tons) and a coking coal washery. Situated close to the
industrialized States of western India, its production is in great demand. The underground mines are
beset with geological problems created by water bearing strata above the coal bed, and most of the
opencast mines started after nationalization face similar problems. The opencast mines are important
sources of power grade coal for western India. Despite difficult working conditions, the productivity at
both underground and opencast mines is moderate, and the company has been making a small profit.



Annex 2.2
Page 5 of 5
Under the recent notification on the deregulation of coal prices, WCL received two benefits: realizing
higher prices for its small quantity of superior quality coal and a special regional price for its lower
grades of steam coal. This will improve the profitability of the company. As a first step towards private
sector entry into the coal sector, the Government has also recently agreed to divest ten percent of WCL
equities to the private sector.
16.     The Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Coal
India, plans and designs all Coal India projects in-house. It was designed and set up in 1970's in
collaboration with similar institutions in Poland and the former Soviet Union. Most of its staff have been
trained in those countries or by their experts in India. CMPDI employs about 4,000 people at seven
regional centers and at its headquarters in Ranchi, Bihar. It is fully equipped to carry out virtually all
aspects of mine design including geological exploration, environmental studies, and detailed design of
underground and opencast mines, coal preparation plants, workshops, residential colonies for employees
and all civil structures.

ANNEX 3.2 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF COAL INDIA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES
1.     Coal India was formed in November 1975 to hold and manage Government's interests in the coal
industry and acted essentially as a conduit for massive public investments to the sector. The primary
objective of these investments was to accelerate the expansion of India's capacity to produce coal.
Investment decisions were driven primarily by domestic demand and by technical and geo-mining
conditions. The financial performance of these investments was of little concern. Consequently Coal India
has accumulated a huge portfolio of unprofitable labor intensive mining projects which was supported by an
elaborate system of cross-subsidization. Cumulative mine cash costs per ton of coal equivalent
(6000kcal/kgm) and labor complement for 1995/96 is illustrated in Figure 3.2.1.

Over time this severely eroded Coal India's financial independence, sustainability and its capacity to finance
investments out of internally generated funds.
2.     A number of factors which adversely affected Coal India's financial performance are:
(a)    coal miners were regarded by Government as having been neglected by the previous private
owners. To compensate them, a wage policy that ensured miners real wage increases was
adopted and perpetuated without any reference to the increases in productivity and
efficiency;
(b)    the obligation and/or custom of providing employment to project affected people and
dependents of employees suffering from death or debility; and
(c)    the Government's efforts to control prices at levels below average costs in response to the
perceived necessity to provide energy as cheaply as possible to the economy. The coal
industry was regarded as a public utility whose sole function was to provide a service to the
rest of the economy.
3.     As a result Coal India incurred losses right from its inception. Because financial returns assumed a
very low priority in the Government's investment strategy, the stage was set for a prolonged period of rising
losses and increasing dependence on the Government for both investment funds and compensation for cash
losses. The level of fiscal support for the compensation of cash losses is indicated in Table 3.2.1.

Note:  1. Cash losses are before depreciation charges.
2. Since 1980-81 this non-plan loan has been under moratorium for
repayment and is interest free.
4.       Towards the end of 1970s the Government's substantial investment program  and support for the
coal sector began to pay off. Coal production and labor productivity increased and after two successive price
increases in July 1979 and February 1981, Coal India's financial health experienced a temporary recovery.
Its dependence on the Government for direct support for cash losses (i.e. non-planned loans) ceased
permanently from 1981 and for the first time in 1982, Coal India earned a marginal pre-tax profit of Rs56
million (US$1.6 million in current terms).
5.       The recovery was, however, short lived due to another round of steep wage increases in January
1983. The consolidated financial statements for the period 1987-1996 are shown in the tables at the end of
this annex. Coal India once again incurred a loss in 1984 and resumed its downward trend thereafter. Despite
a further coal price increase in January 1984 and again in January 1986, Coal India was unable to reverse the
trend and its losses continued to increase. This reached a peak in 1986 at a level of Rs4,042 million
(equivalent to US$126 million in current terms). Coal India did not, however, incur cash losses (before
allowing for depreciation and interest charges) during this period. In 1987 GOI implemented BICP's price
escalation formula (based on normative costs) . Thereafter, with more frequent BICP price increases (see
para 14), Coal India staged a modest but persistent recovery as illustrated in Table 3.2.2.

6.      This improvement was further enhanced by the growth in the power sector and other coal
consuming industries which led to a significant increase in the demand for coal. To meet this demand Coal
India gave priority to investments in high yielding and low cost mechanized opencast projects. Investments
in underground mines were restricted largely to safety, ventilation, equipment replacement and only limited
creation of new capacity to offset the effects of natural ore depletion. A large number of underground mines
in ECL and BCCL were experiencing difficult geo-mining conditions and efforts to raise production from
these mines by undertaking financially marginal investments were not successful.
7.      Consequently Coal India maintained a high rate of growth in coal production of around 5.6 percent
per annum from the latter part of the 1980s. Coal output increased from 131 million tons in 1985 to 237
million tons in 1996. The rapid shift to low cost opencast mining and the consequent opportunity to absorb,
at least in part, surplus labor, helped to contain the increase in average unit costs of production. The
compound rate of increase in the average cost of production per annum for the first time fell, albeit
marginally, below the rate of inflation as indicated in Table 3.2.3.

8.      This shift to opencast mining was, however, accomplished at the expense of a deterioration in coal
quality in terms of ash content, calorific value and the unit price realized. The inherent problems of waste
dilution (where certain amounts of overburden are mixed with coal during the process of mining) led to a
further deterioration in coal quality. Despite the design and introduction of power house boilers that were
capable of using these lower quality coals, disputes with large consumers over quality, together with the
growing financial weakness of most State Electricity Boards (SEBs), aggravated the problems of non-
payment for coal deliveries which emerged as a significant factor towards the end of the 1980's. More
recently the introduction of the cash-and-carry component of the reform measures (see para 3.17) began to
bear fruit in 1995/96 by reversing this adverse trend. The movement in receivables, expressed as the average
number of days of sales, is illustrated in Table 3.2.4.

9.    In 1985, for the second time the Government appointed the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices
(BICP) to undertake; (i) an examination of the cost structure of the mines operated by Coal India; and (ii)
recommend an appropriate price for the various grades of coal produced by Coal India (Annex 3.3). BICP
recommended an overall average price for Coal India which was based upon:
(a)    a norms related cost structure of specific inputs which assumed an efficient mining
operation and a fixed ratio of opencast to underground production;
(b)    an adjustment to ensure a pre tax return of 12 percent per annum on funds invested; and
(c)    an escalation formula to provide for the periodic increase in the price of inputs.
These recommendations were accepted by Government in 1987 and since then coal prices have been
administered on the basis of the BICP formula, although on occasion there was a considerable time lag in
the implementation of these price revisions. The administered prices for coking coal and the higher grades
of thermal coal were abolished in early 1996 in pursuance of the reform measures undertaken by the
Ministry of Coal (para 2.09).
10.    Although the formula was intended to compensate Coal India and its subsidiaries for all cost
increases, until recently it had failed to the extent that:
(a)    price adjustments were based on past cost increases. Coal India therefore was required to
absorb all cost pressures between revisions; and
(b)    the return on capital component of the price was related to the historic net fixed assets per
ton of capacity which was substantially below the cost of new capacity creation.
This situation was alleviated to some extent by; i) the fact that the historic ratio of underground to opencast
production has undergone a favorable change for Coal India, declining from 41% in 1987 to 23% in 1996;
and ii) BICP's recommendation to narrow the price differential will favor the lower grades of coal.
11.    Table 3.2.5 outlines the comparison of the updated normative cost based on the BICP formula with
the average cost of production in the corresponding year. The actual cost of production was 14 percent
higher than the normative cost in 1987. By 1995 the actual cost had fallen 9 percent below its normative
equivalent. This was largely due to an improvement in labor productivity resulting from the higher
proportion of production from opencast mines and Coal India's ability to sustain annual growth of 5.6
percent annum in production with a reduced labor compliment.

12.     Coal India had an aggregate manpower of 675,115 as at the end of 1987. Coal production in that
year was 145 million tons resulting in the output per manshift being 0.99 tons. The trend in the level of
manpower and productivity in terms of output per manshift since 1987 and the resulting unit cash cost of
coal in constant 1995 terms is shown in Table 3.2.6.

13.    The continued growth in production together with a marginal reduction in manpower resulted in the
better utilization of surplus labor and consequently in an increase in labor productivity by approximately 79
percent on an overall basis. This, coupled with a shift in the production mix in favor of low cost opencast
mining, has helped keep the aggregate unit cost of production under control. Nonetheless these costs vary
considerably from company to company and indeed between collieries within each company. The 1996 cash
costs for each company are illustrated in Table 3.2.7 as well as the average price realized by Coal India.
ECL and BCCL continue to survive at the expense of the others. These two companies have limited capacity
to expand and represent the most labor-intensive subsidiaries of Coal India employing 49 percent of its labor
force while producing 23 percent of its production (see Table 3.2.2). Labor alone contributes 64 and 68
percent of the cash costs of BCCL and ECL respectively.

14.     Since December 1987, Coal prices which were fixed in terms of the BICP formula, have risen at an
annual compound rate of 9 percent as outlined in Table 3.2.8. This compares with the average increase in
costs of 7.1 percent per annum (see para 7) and has underpinned the improvement in Coal India's level of
profitability over this period.

Note: 1. With effect from Dec. 95 premia for Slack coal, Steam coal and Long
Flame coal were increased by Rs3, RslO and Rs35 per ton respectively resulting in
an overall impact of about 4% on average coal price.
2. With effect from March 96 price for lower grade coals of WCL have been
increased to the level at par with that of Singareni Coal Company Ltd. impact for
which for WCL only, is about 25% per annum on average sales price.
3. With effect from April 1996 coking coals and higher grades of non-coking coals
have been deregulated.
15.     Despite the shortcomings of the BICP formula, Coal India was able to translate the shift in
production mix, improvement in capacity utilization and increased labor productivity into a reduced loss in
1989 and thereafter into a rising trend in profits. Clearly 1992 represented the turning point in the financial
position of Coal India (see the Income Statement for 1987 through 1996 on page 1 1 of this annex). Like
operating costs however, operating profits vary considerably between companies (Table 3.2.9).
16.     Although substantial profits of Rs14 billion were earned in 1996 by NCL, SECL, MCL and WCL,
an analysis of the operating results indicate that a large part of this was dissipated by losses incurred by
ECL, BCCL and CCL amounting to Rs7.6 billion, in spite of better coal quality and higher unit sales value.

17.    To provide for these loss making activities, the Government and Coal India created a retention price
system (CPRA) (Annex 6.1 para 4). This approach clearly regarded each company as merely a division of
Coal India and effectively:
(a)     undermined corporate identity, independence and operating autonomy of each company;
(b)     prevented the retention of sufficient income within each company and limited their ability
to operate as commercial entities;
(c)     caused taxation difficulties due to the disproportionate allocation of interest charges; and
(d)     reduced management's incentive to control and reduce costs, clouded accountability and
created an unwieldy conglomerate which was difficult to control and manage.
In view of the withdrawal of budgetary support and deregulation of the coal price, Coal India is decided to
ensure its survival by (i) phasing out these practices; (ii) emphasizing the necessity to improve efficiency,
eliminate waste and control costs throughout the group; (iii) restructuring its balance sheet to ensure the
independent financial operation of each company; (iv) restricting its role to that of strategic direction and
the receipt of dividends and debt servicing; and (v) ultimately allowing each company to compete freely and
operate independently.
18.    Coal India cannot rely on the high rate of demand growth and post liberalization real price increases
to continue indefinitely. Consequently the company has little option but to pursue a vigorous cost cutting
strategy and the development of cost conscienceness at all levels of the company. A comprehensive program
designed to reduce the cost of sales and achieve a working ratio of no more than 0.8 is essential if the
company is to become independent of budgetary support. This compares with the present ratio of 0.97 as
indicated by the financial ratios on page 12 of this annex. With the deregulation of coal prices, the CPRA



Annex 3.2
Page 8 of 13
process of internal cross subsidization has become obsolete as there are no longer any eligible recipients and
will be discontinued from 1996/97.
19.    The trend in internal cash generation within Coal India is shown in Table 3.2.10. Overall, Coal India
has never generated sufficient cash to support its loss making operations and provide for the investment
required to maintain and increase capacity. Coal India amassed arrears of Rs22 billion (US$630 million) at
the end of March 1992, equivalent to 35 percent of the company's total long term liabilities (see para 12
Annex 6.1). As indicated in the Balance Sheet on page 14, Coal India is at present almost at the limit of its
borrowing capacity with its debt to equity ratio standing at 53 percent of funds employed. In the absence of
further budgetary support, Coal India can no longer afford to undertake uneconomic projects and support
loss-making activities, carry excessive inventories or finance their customers (para 20) if it is to rebuild its
financial resources, maintain its market share and become commercially viable and self sustaining.

20.    Despite the rising trend in profits, Coal India's liquidity position continues to remain under
pressure. Over the period 1981 and 1996, net receivables increased from 43 days of sales to 80 days net
before improving to 58 days of sales (89 days gross) at the end of March 1996 as shown in Table 3.2.11.
The improvement results from the implementation of a strict "cash and carry policy" requiring customers to
pay in cash or against a confirmed letter of credit for all coal shipments. Net receivables amounted to Rs2 1.1
billion (US$605 million), after providing for unsecured and doubtful debts of Rs 11.4 billion (representing
35 percent of the total arnounts outstanding). Amounts outstanding in excess of six months at the end March
1996 totaled Rs24.3 billion (US$695 million). The problem has occurred mostly with CCL whose net
receivables have risen to Rs7.6 billion (US$215) or 154 days of sales in 1996.

21.     Notwithstanding clear improvements in working capital management, Coal India's liquidity
continues to be aggravated by the relatively high level of inventories, comprising mainly stores and to a
lesser extent coal stocks. Table 3.2.12. shows this trend for the period 1987 - 1996.

Note : Stores inventory level is in terms of months' consumption and Coal Stock
inventory level is in terms of months' net sales.
Table 3.2.13 outlines the position at the end March 1996 for the company and its subsidiaries. Inventories
amount to Rs23.3 billion (approx. US$667 million) which is 6.5 times the monthly consumption in the case
of stores and 1.6 months of sales in the case of finished coal stocks. These levels are still excessive even
allowing for the seasonal variation in coal stocks which traditionally peak in March of each year.
Notwithstanding an impressive reduction in working capital of Rs 13.9 billion in 1996, the proper
management of working capital will need further attention and the development of the materials
management system accelerated to the extent possible.

22.      Coal India's cost of meeting the Government-imposed commercial and social objectives has been
financed in the past in an arbitrary manner, reflecting the Government's policy toward all of its state-owned



Annex 3.2

enterprises (that is, using an equal proportion of debt and equity). The resulting debt burden amounted to
Rs61.6 billion (US$1.8 billion) at the end of March 1996. Due to an investment policy which did not
emphasize the financial viability of projects, equity (and consequently borrowing capacity) has been
progressively reduced by accumulated losses to Rs53.2 billion (US$1.6 billion). The debt to equity ratio has
been maintained at around the limit of 60 percent since 1985 as indicated by the ratio analysis on page 12 of
this Annex. More recently the waiver of interest arrears of Rs8.92 billion by the Government as part of the
capital restructuring has enabled Coal India to both increase its equity position and reduce its liabilities to
Government resulting in an improved Debt to equity ratio of 54% as at end March 1996. Incremental
borrowings will nonetheless be restricted in the longer term to 1.5 times the net earnings Coal India is able
to generate and reinvest in the future.
23.   Government contributions to the financing of Coal India's operations and investment have declined
since 1981. Equity contributions that provided for 45 percent of funding in 1981 fell to 4 percent in 1993
and, after staging an odd increase to nine percent in 1995, declined to zero percent in 1996. Government
loans were also reduced from 55 percent in 1981 to zero percent in 1996. Between 1981 and 1985, Coal
India's internal cash generation (i.e. profits after taxes plus depreciation and less changes in working capital
and debt service) was negative, but by 1990 it contributed 6 percent of capital expenditures. By 1996 it was
able to meet 69 percent of its financial requirements for new investments. The improvement in self-
financing was achieved in part by the improvement of Coal India's operating performance due to higher
coal prices and, to a certain extent, by a cut back in capital expenditures pending finalization of the IBRD
project and reduction in working capital.
24.    Coal India has limited borrowing capacity. As a consequence the company implemented a
Government sponsored debt forgiveness and financial restructuring program in 1996/97 (Annex 6.1, para
11). The company's viability depends on its ability to invest in the further expansion of productive capacity,
improve the utilization of plant and equipment and close loss making operations. As a consequence, the
restructuring of the company's balance sheet was a necessary step to enable Coal India to; i) proceed with
the CSRP without breaching its existing loan covenants; ii) create new capacity to meet market growth and
absorb surplus labor; and iii) finance an enhanced voluntary retirement scheme.
25.   In addition to Government financed long-term loans, Coal India has in the past entered the domestic
market and raised other long-term liabilities. It has issued bonds worth Rs 15.0 billion (approximately
US$417 million) in addition to other bilateral loans, excluding IBRD, amounting to Rs9.7 billion (US$343
million). Overdraft and revolving bank credits are being used to fund 60 percent of net current assets.

Annex 3.3

ANNEX 3.3 IMPROVEMENT OF COAL QUALITY
1.      Indian thermal coal, in general, is of inherently low quality. Its structure contains finely
disseminated clays and shale which cannot be removed by low cost, gravity-based washing techniques.
More expensive beneficiation techniques are required to improve its quality. The boilers of Indian power
stations, however, are specifically designed to burn Indian coals. The boilers could operate efficiently
with low quality coal, as long as its quality is consistent.
2.      The single Indian criterion of thermal coal quality, its 'useful heat value (UHV),' is decreasing at
the rate of about 2% per year. However, the purpose of this annex is not to comment on the inherent
quality of Indian coal, but to discuss ways of improving the quality of the product delivered to power
stations. This would result in higher efficiency and availability, a reduced requirement for rail transport
and would reduce pollution.
3.     The quality of Indian thermal coal is measured in terms of its 'useful heat value' in kcal/kg,
claiming to be a relative index of the commercial value in marketing coal, although it is not physically
measured as such but is determined by applying the more easily analytically determined ash and
moisture content percentages to an empirical formula designed by the Central Fuel Research Institute in
Dhanbad. This formula is taken as representative of all Indian thermal coals regardless of their area of
origin'. The system has no parallel outside India and would not be accepted by foreign power companies
since it has no direct correlation to delivered heat.
Pricing Structure
4.      The 1996 coal price structure governing the selling prices of high-moisture (with an inherent
moisture content greater than 2%) thermal coals, consists of a succession of seven unequally spaced and
unequally wide steps defining the long-established coal grades, ranging from grade A (Rs 795 per ton) to
G (Rs 203 per ton). The prices of the higher grades, A, B and C, have recently been decontrolled. Grade
G is not known to be produced at this time since its value in power generation terms is considered to be
negligible. Grades D, E and F constitute the majority of coals presently produced by Coal India for
thermal power generation. Careless handling and inclusion of extraneous matter in the product can often
be advantageous to a mine, since it can increase output tonnage, without incurring a penalty on the price
per ton. At the same time, the costs of transporting the extraneous matter, handling it, crushing it,
burning it, and disposing of the resultant ash are borne not by the mining companies, but by the power
generating companies since the coal is sold on an ex-mine basis.
5.      The stepped price structure actually encourages the production of dirty coal if that can be done
without slipping into a lower-priced grade. This means variation of up to 10% in ash content within one
grade. A straight line gradient (sliding scale) between the mid-points of the presently-defined steps
would cost the power companies no more overall if qualities remained the same as before but would
Washing coal in a water-based medium would exacerbate a condition which is a regular source of complaint from the power
companies. Coal in India is measured by UHV-IV, stated as a calorific value in kilocalories per kilogram but, in fact,
determined only by ash and moisture percentages applied in the empirical formula, UHV = 8900-138(A+M), where A and M
are percentages of ash and moisture respectively. Both of these constituents are determined analytically at 60% relative
humidity and 400C temperature, thus most or all of any surface water attaching to coal, due to its being washed, would be
evaporated prior to the determination of moisture content. Surface water on coal delivered to a power plant increases its
weight and decreases its actual heat value without affecting the UHV, which determines its price per ton.



Annex 3.3
Page 2 of 5
provide a clear incentive to produce cleaner coal since any effort to do so, however small, would result in
a higher selling price per ton.
Inclusion Of Extraneous Matter
6.    The code of practice laid down by Coal India's technical subsidiary, CMPDI in Ranchi, requires
non-coal intercalation more than one meter thick to be excavated separately and disposed of in the
backfilling of the mine. This means that, in practice, anything of one meter thickness or less is
incorporated into the product sent to the power plant. At initial mine design stage, borehole cores of a
coal seam and its associated partings, are analyzed for calorific value, ash, moisture, volatile matter,
fixed carbon and sulfur content. These data are used to determine an optimal-value mix of coal (less than
40% ash), shaly coal (40% to 55% ash), carbonaceous shale (55% to 75% ash) and non-carbonaceous
material, with the aim of maximizing revenue. In the actual mining process, however, careless cleaning
of a coal seam surface prior to its excavation and the inclusion of partings, resulting from total-seam
blasting, means that a significant quantity of foreign matter is routinely included in a mine's output, thus
degrading the optimal mix and attracting justified penalties from the customer. Once mixed in with the
product, these contaminants can only be removed by washing. However, if blasting is not used, they can,
in many cases, be carefully separated and removed in the mine at the coal face by selective excavation,
thus obviating the need for washing.
7.    It is quite practical for Coal India to separate non-coal intercalation of 20cm or more, given the
right equipment and an effective incentive to do so. In contrast, in British Coal opencast mining, the
separation and discard of any non-coal intercalation of 5cm or more is mandated.
The Choice Of Mining Methods
8.    It was stated above, that with proper care, foreign matter contained in seam partings can be
separated and removed in the mine at the coal face by selective excavation, thus obviating any need for
washing. This is routine operating practice in other countries. Such care would virtually eliminate the
need for coal washers and coal washing. However, it will require a major change in operating procedures
and an increase in cost. If a non-coal matter is visually distinguishable from coal and of a significant
volume it can be excavated separately with appropriate mining equipment and discarded. Coal India's
mines do not at present possess the appropriate equipment or expertise to do so. For soft, easy to mine
coal, the equipment is relatively inexpensive (compared to the capital investment required for a washer)
and the expertise is not difficult to develop. Indian thermal coals, are interbedded with finely
disseminated non-coal matter and, as a result, do not shatter easily. They are tough, rather than brittle. At
present, coal seams are drilled and blasted to make loading easier. Non-coal partings, where they exist,
are thereby mixed with the coal and become extractable only by washing. Selective mining equipment
may not always be the preferred choice over coal washing. Each mine should therefore be studied to
determine the best to economic choice for coal mining method. Suggested selective mining equipment, if
preferred, could be the US-built EasiMiner (restricted to near-horizontal formations) or large bulldozers
equipped with heavy-duty, multi-tined rippers teamed with front-end loaders or hydraulic excavators.
The latter two are being now in common use in India's mines.
9.    Since coal seams and their partings generally occur in approximate horizontal book form,
selective excavation involves sequential horizontal 'slicing' by a suitable excavator over an appropriately
large area of coal and non-coal layers. In the event that either material is so resilient that it is not
responsive to direct attack by an excavator bucket it must first be broken by some other means, such as a



Annexl3
Page 3 of 5
bulldozer/ ripper designed to be nonnally capable of ripping and shattering hard rock. The broken
material would then be bulldozed into stockpiles and loaded into trucks by excavator or front-end loader
for sale or disposal. The method would additionally provide a primary coal crushing function. The
'EasiMiner', previously mentioned, is self-contained, actually milling or ripping the coal in thin
horizontal slices and loading it onto an integral conveyor which, in turn, loads the now-broken coal into a
truck moving alongside. However, its ability to excavate the tougher Indian coals is unproved and would
have to be confirmed.
Inappropriate Working Practices
10.    A working practice which should be discontinued is the blasting of coal seams that contain
significant intercalation of non-coal matter acceptable by CMPDI's dimensional standards. Blasting
effectively makes separation impossible since the non-coal matter is mixed inextricably with the coal
itself.
11.   Two areas contributing additional extraneous matter to the product are at the top and bottom of
the coal seam. In the former case, insufficient attention is given to the careful cleaning off of the upper
surface of the seam to remove material left by the overburden stripping excavators or spilled by dump
trucks. In the latter case, it is very easy, when using a rope operated shovel, to excavate into the material
below the floor of the coal seam and include that matter in the final product or to deliberately stop short
of the floor and waste coal in the process.
Coal Beneficiation By Washing
12.   All coals contain impurities to some extent. If these impurities reach proportions unacceptable to
the available market they have to be reduced, otherwise the coal becomes unsellable. In the majority of
cases this reduction will involve mechanically processing the coal in a liquid bath which will exploit the
fact that coal-matter is lighter than most of its normal contaminants, i.e. shale, rock, pyrite, etc. This
liquid based process is usually referred to as 'washing' although it can more accurately be described as
'separation' since in practice it separates heavier fractions from lighter fractions of the material input.
13.   Both jig-washers and heavy-medium washers are primarily designed to separate distinct coal
from distinct non-coal matter and are normally designed to wash material which has been crushed to a
maximum screen size of around 50 to 1 00mm. In instances where the differences are not so distinct a
third product, called 'middlings', is produced. Indian thermal coal, in its natural state uncontaminated by
extraneous matter, is a matrix of finely disseminated coal matter and clay/shale particles. If excavated
cleanly, i.e. without the inclusion of loose non-coal matter, it cannot be improved by the washing
methods described above. In order to separate out the clay/ shale content the coal would have to be finely
ground to liberate the coal from its matrix and then separated by froth-flotation, a mechanical and oil-
based process not used for the preparation of low-value thermal coal of this type because of the high cost
of doing so.
14.   Coal washing can be justified only if the price structure will provide the economic incentives.
This can be demonstrated by the following example: SECL is currently negotiating a contract proposal
with the US-based Roberts and Schaefer for the building and operation of a washery capable of
processing six million tons per year of raw coal from SECL's Dipka opencast mine, one of the Coal
Sector Rehabilitation Project subprojects. Preliminary data indicate that ash content of the raw coal will
be reduced from 38% to between 34% and 30% by washing, albeit with a 13% loss of input tonnage as



Annex 3.3

rejects. The data predict a contract washing cost of Rs 1 15 per raw ton. Even if the washed coal were to
be sold at the more advantageous sliding scale based on grade prices, as previously described, total sales
revenues would decrease by the equivalent of around Rs 100 per ton. Reducing the ash content further
would result in a reduced yield, thus any further gain in UHV from ash reduction is likely to be
compensated for by the reduction in yield. From the coal company's viewpoint, only if the price of
washed coal was to be negotiated at an economic price, well above that fixed by the Government's
present coal pricing structure (even if modified to a sliding scale), would coal washing be economically
warranted.
15.   It should be mentioned that any washing process will generate large volumes of high ash
carbonaceous 'reject' residue. Indian coal, is very susceptible to spontaneous combustion. The residue,
which includes fines, will also be susceptible to spontaneous combustion. If not disposed of properly,
the pile of reject residue may become a source for major air pollution at the mine site.
The Benefits To The Power Plant
16.   A short-term (one-month) exercise carried out in late 1987, where washed coal from Nandan
washery was used in the Satpura power station. The coal in its raw state, had an 'inerts' (ash plus
moisture) content of 48%. In its washed state its 'inerts' were 35%. The power plant showed cost savings
of Rs55 per ton of raw coal, at that time. Selling prices of E and F grade coals have since escalated to
245% of those existing in 1987 which, if applied to Rs55, would equate with Rs135 per ton. From these
figures and those predicted for SECL's Dipka washery there would appear to be adequate margin for the
power companies to absorb an appropriate increase in price for washed coal in exchange for the benefits
accruing to them consequent upon its use. However, the reported results in 1987 terms also included the
figure for the purchase of landed raw coal as being Rs245 per ton, whereas the figure predicted for
washed coal was Rs600 per ton. On those figures there is no economic basis for the washing of that
particular coal.
17.   The exercise referred to above resulted in significant operating improvements. The average
plant-utilization and plant-load factors rose from 74% to 96%. MWH generated, per ton of coal used,
were 40% higher. Fuel oil consumption dropped to only 4% of 'normal'. Specific coal consumption
dropped by 28%. Dust concentration at the electrostatic precipitators dropped by 95% at the inlet and
98% at the outlet. In the coal handling units, shearpin failures, caused primarily by hard foreign matter
contained in the coal, dropped to 0.3% of 'normal'. Other statistics showed similar improvement directly
attributable to the use of washed coal.
18.   The benefits to the generating companies are substantial; less wear on crushing equipment, less
material to handle, less ash to dispose of, less rail transport cost and greater boiler efficiency. Pollution
due to ash and its toxic constituents are severely reduced and less land is needed for ash disposal. A
formula which equitably distributes the financial benefits of cleaner coal, in line with the landed price of
imported coal, should be agreed and implemented, case by case, together with appropriate penalties for
quality below agreed target values.
Incentives
19.    As long as any efforts by the coal industry towards a cleaner product are likely to go
unrewarded, the present situation will not change. There must be incentives or directives to implement
changes in equipment and working practices to improve the overall product, as well as financial penalties

for not doing so. Remuneration should be based on actual heat quantities transferred from the coal
company to the power company. This would necessitate the abandonment of the present UHV system
and require determination of net calorific value (together with proximate analysis) carried out on a
frequent and regular basis. Power companies regularly purchasing large quantities of coal should have
the right to inspect coal in-situ and refuse shipment of coal at the mine if it can be seen to contain
unacceptable levels of contaminants. Contracts between the companies should contain agreed payment
rates, based on measured gross calorific values of coal received on a monthly average basis, and
penalties for excessive ash content and inconsistencies in coal quality.
Conclusions
20.   Large-scale washing tests need to be done at pilot-plants to determine economic viability.
Detailed and comprehensive costing should be done and the effect of variables examined. All testing
should be done with the cooperation of consumers so that their benefits, if any, can also be assessed in
economic terms.
21.   Selective excavation should be carefully tested and costed at the minesite and its results
compared with washing predictions. Far greater discipline than is presently apparent in the separation of
coal from non-coal will have to be imposed at the coal face and appropriate equipment will have to be
procured or rented on a temporary basis.

ANNEX 4.2 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING COMPONENT
1.    The past record of Coal India in project implementation has been uneven, often there are both
time and cost overruns. Though production growth (about 6% per year) has been impressive, Coal India
suffers from some inherent weaknesses, as does the system in which it operates. These may be broadly
classified into weaknesses of policy environment, institutional strength and project implementation
capacity. Technical assistance proposals are designed to strengthen the capabilities in each of these areas.
Policy Support
2.    Rationalization of rules and regulations of the coal industry. Coal India's operations are
affected by a myriad of mining and other statutes, rules and regulations, many of which are not always
supportive of a mineral extraction industry. Over 20 Government agencies are involved in the process of
overseeing, control and regulation of the industry. It takes lot of time and effort to get the requisite
licenses, permits and environmental clearances; approvals to acquire land, especially forest land; open
mine; produce and sell coal; and recover cesses, taxes, and royalties on behalf of the Government
agencies and provide accounts for them. Further, Coal India is required to operate a number social
welfare activities which were previously run by the Government directly. These problems would also
become major bottleneck for the promotion of the private investment in the sector. The project provides
a technical assistance program for a team of international and Indian experts to review the entire coal
industry regulatory system, compare them with other leading coal mining countries abroad and
recommend more suitable regulatory framework based on legislation in other countries.
Institution Building
3.    Commercialization of coal sales. The price and distribution of coal are regulated by the
Government under the Colliery Control Order. The recent Government decision to deregulate coal price
and distribution seeks to replace these administered pricing and distribution mechanisms with market-
determined mechanisms. Shifting from the centrally controlled practice to the market based one is a
difficult and complicated task. In addition to the regulatory reform review mentioned above, this
technical assistance component will help Coal India commercialize the sale of coal in the new liberalized
sector environment. A team of international and local marketing and legal experts would provide
technical assistance to Coal India in commercializing its coal sales, particularly in improving their tender
method. Legal experts would help Coal India develop coal supply contracts.
4.    Improvement of CMPDI's design practices. All Coal India projects are planned and designed
in-house by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Coal India. CMPDI employs about 4,000 people at seven regional centers and at its headquarters in
Ranchi, Bihar. It is fully equipped to carry out virtually all aspects of mine design including geological
exploration, environmental studies, and detailed design of underground and opencast mines, coal
preparation plants, workshops, residential colonies for employees and all civil structures.
5.    CMPDI designs tend to be repetitive and lack flexibility. They are mostly based on indigenously
manufactured equipment or those imported from specified countries. Little attention is paid to alternative
technologies utilizing other equipment to optimize production and productivity. The project provides
expatriate technical assistance to review existing mine design and practices, including 24 subprojects
under this loan, and recommend a timebound program to improve them. The program will also explore
whether some current activities could be carried out more economically by private consulting firms.



Annex 4.2
Page 2 of 7
6.    Improvement in corporate financial planning and implementation of the restructuring
process. Coal India is one of the largest business enterprises in India and has a turnover of almost US$4
billion. With the withdrawal of Government budgetary support, Coal India has to depend on internal
resources and market borrowings to meet investment needs. The project provides technical assistance
from international financial advisory services to enhance Coal India's capability in preparing financial
models as a part of its ongoing commercialization process and to enable the company to borrow from
international financial markets. This component also includes technical assistance to enhance Coal
India's capability to implement the restructuring process.
7.    Training of Coal India's managers. Since the nationalization, Coal India's efforts have been
mainly directed at attaining the production targets set by the Government rather than any commercial
objective of becoming a profitable company. It has been run by the Govemment similar to a utility to
supply cheap power coal to the State Electricity Boards and others. Now that the company has to find its
own investment funds by generating sufficient profit and through borrowing from the market on its own
financial strength, managers require a new orientation to this commercial environment.
8.    The success of Coal lndia's efforts to become more efficient and commercially viable will
depend upon the support it can have from its middle and senior level managers. There are about 20,000
executives in the company of which about 10% are in the middle to higher level of line management.
Bank has agreed to finance a training program to develop commercial orientation for these managers.
Coal India has agreed to train them at different national management training institutes within three
years, in line with a curriculum, acceptable to the Bank, that will familiarize these managers with the
principles and techniques of managing commercial operations.
Project Implementation
9.    Improvement of equipment utilization. Coal India is the owner of the largest opencast
equipment fleet in the world, yet its record of equipment maintenance, availability and utilization is poor.
Some of it is due to the lack of adequate supply of spare parts from indigenous equipment manufacturers
or excessive duty on imported equipment and spare parts and shortage of foreign exchange (prior to
1992). However, the main reason is the poor repair and maintenance and operational practices in the field
and at the workshops. Coal India has agreed to review its operations with a view to identifying activities
which could be contracted to outside agencies for efficiency and cost saving. A panel of mining and
other engineers and management experts, financed through the technical assistance program will assist
the companies. Coal India has agreed to take whatever steps necessary to quickly phase out activities that
can be carried out more profitably by outside agencies.
10.   Procurement assistance. Procedural delays in the procurement of plant and equipment,
finalization of contracts, lack of proper monitoring tools and lack of delegation of responsibility have
been the bane of many projects' implementation. Coal India is aware of these shortcomings and sought
technical assistance from the Bank in late 1993 to strengthen its organization for the preparation,
implementation and monitoring of projects to minimize the risk of delays. In February 1994, the Bank
approved the Project Preparation Fund to provided technical assistance for the preparation of:
(a)    a Sectoral Environmental Assessment for the coal sector as a whole and Environmental
Management Plans for each subproject;
(b)    Rehabilitation Action Plans for project-affected people of each subproject in line with
Coal India's Resettlement and Rehabilitation Policy, approved by the Government and
Bank;
(c)    optimizing the design of mine feasibility reports and equipment configuration; and



Annex 4.2
Page 3 of 7
(d)    scheduling of equipment procurement activities, standardizing equipment sizes,
preparing technical specifications and suitably packaging the goods for inviting bids.
11.   Activities (a) and (b) were completed in 1994-95 and formed part of the Environment and Social
Mitigation Project (Cr. 2862-1N). An international consulting firm was selected in January 1994 to carry
out the jobs listed in (c) and to submit their report in three months. Since there was a delay of more than
30 months in the appraisal of the project, the same consultants were again invited in September 1996 to
update their earlier report and it was received in December 1996. Another group of international
consultants was appointed to assist Coal India's procurement cell in June 1994 for the activities listed in
(d). They will continue throughout the duration of the project to assist Coal India in the preparation of
bid documents and the technical review of the bids received. The cell has already prepared a number of
bid documents which are being reviewed by the Bank.
12.   Coal quality improvement. Indian coal seams are very thick and often highly interbedded with
sandstone and shale bands. The mining excavation techniques used by Coal India tend to disregard the
presence of such incombustible materials, even when they are one or two meters thick. No efforts are
made to separate them and they are loaded along with coal. Besides the inherent high ash content of these
thick coal seams, the dirt bands and the other inert material from the roof and floor of the coal seams get
mixed with coal further increasing the ash content.
13.   Steam coal is rarely washed in India: run-of-mine coal is simply crushed and screened into sizes
before being dispatched to the customers. There are complaints from consumers about high ash content
and the visible inert material in the coal. Coal washing may not be always remunerative. Moreover, the
Government regulated low price structure for power grade coal has not permitted any compensation for
the beneficiation process.
14.   Experts consider that some improvement in coal quality is possible if mine management takes
specific inexpensive steps to separately excavate the thick inert bands. Technical assistance will include
a feasibility study to determine four sites under different geological and mining conditions and identify
the required equipment. The investment component will finance procurement of such equipment.
15.   Technical assistance will also identify and prioritize technically feasible, and financially and
economically viable, coal mining and coal preparation options to improve coal quality. It has been
decided that a study will be conducted under the IDA-financed Environmental Management Capacity
Building Project (Cr. 2930-1N) to examine the conditions under which measures to improve the overall
efficiency and environmental performance of the coal-energy chain (mining-preparation-transportation-
conversion) could be implemented.
16.    Assistance in project supervision. The project has 24 mine subprojects spread over ten
coalfields in five States. Some of them are located two days rail journey from Calcutta. It would be
difficult for the Bank mission to visit even the seven major projects (with investments exceeding US$50
million each) once a year, let alone all the mines. Therefore, it is proposed to engage a team of local
consultants with requisite experience in opencast mining operations to visit all the mines at least once in
every quarter and independently report to the Bank and Coal India. The consultants will be treated as an
extension of the Bank supervision mission. Both the Government of India and Coal India have agreed to
a similar arrangement for the supervision of the Environment and Social Mitigation Project.
16.   Table 4.2.1 presents a summary of all technical assistance proposals along with brief terms of
reference and estimates of cost. The cost of all technical assistance proposals is estimated at US$13.3
million. Some will be completed in a few months and other will take the full duration of the project life.
Some of the programs have already been completed and financed through the PPF.

ANNEX 4.3 COAL SECTOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MITIGATION PROJECT (ESMP)
STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
June 9, 1997
Background
1.    Coal India has requested Bank assistance for the proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project
(CSRP). In mid-1995, Bank Management recognized that the social and the environmental risks of the
proposed CSRP were of such a magnitude that they needed to be dealt with by a dedicated free-standing
mitigation project which should start before the implementation of major investments under the CSRP.
Thus, two projects - to be linked by adequate cross-conditionalities (see Table 4.3.1) - were identified:
(a) ESMP, which supports Coal India's objective of making coal production environmentally and
socially sustainable in the twenty-five mines and ensuring that possible negative effects of coal mining
expansion are alleviated; and (b) the proposed CSRP which would support market-oriented coal sector
reform, and investments in twenty-four' selected, highly profitable and economically viable mines. On
May 16, 1996, when the Executive Directors considered the ESMP, they requested that a note on the
status of implementation of ESMP be submitted before negotiations for the proposed CSRP are initiated.
Project Background
2.    ESMP comprises: (i) a capacity building component which would enhance Coal India's
environmental and social management capacity to deal effectively with the environmental and social
issues of coal mining operations; (ii) an investment component which would support the implementation
of Environmental Action Plans (EAPs), Rehabilitation Action Plans (RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples'
Development Plans (IPDPs) for the twenty-five selected mines with the assistance of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and community involvement; and (iii) a social remedial action component to
review and, if necessary, implement a program of resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) measures for
three previously Bank-financed coal projects.
Status of Implementation
3.    Coal India committed to undertake a number of specific activities associated with project launch
and implementation. Table 4.3.2 shows that all actions which are covered by dated covenants have been
achieved. Table 4.3.3 shows that most of the agreed Performance Indicators have been met. Achievement
of indicators related primarily to community infrastructure have been delayed. This is because the Bank
advised Coal India against proceeding with construction of physical works until consultative processes
with the local communities have been completed. Five Bank supervision missions for ESMP were
undertaken between February through May 1997, including a specific mission that focused on mines
which have attracted NGO attention. As a result of this intensive effort, Bank staff have identified
several additional actions to be taken by Coal India in order to improve results on the ground. These
additional actions are listed in Table 4.3.4.
Coal India had withdrawn one of the ESMP project mines from the consideration of CSRP and will finance the
investments with their own funds.

4.    The supervision teams found more positive developments in Orissa compared to Bihar and also
noted the great diversity of conditions and problems faced by different mining communities and mine
sites. The inescapable conclusion has been that while it is possible to mitigate the negative social and
environmental impacts of coal mining in regions which are already disadvantaged by poverty and other
social complexities, it is likely to be a long and a continuing process.
5.    The supervision teams also confirmed that Coal India and its subsidiaries have put in place an
improved Resettlement and Rehabilitation policy, environmental standards for coal mining, and initiated
the preparation of a remedial action plan - based on surveys and NGO-assisted consultation - for persons
below poverty line who had been adversely affected by the three previously Bank-financed coal projects
(the mines of Dudhichua, Gevra and Jharia). Coal India has reinforced this commitment by appointing
the required staff, consultants, review and oversight panels, and the facilitating NGOs to ensure effective
implementation of these new policies, standards and plans.
6.    What now lies ahead for Coal India and subsidiaries is forging a more collaborative and effective
partnership between themselves, local communities and other stakeholders. This too is likely to be a
time-consuming process. The legacy of past mistakes - none of the twenty-five mines is a "greenfield
site" - will not be easy to overcome. Ready-made solutions are not available, particularly as Coal India is
no longer in a position merely to provide permanent employment to all comers. Responses tailored to the
special social, cultural, and political circumstances and needs of particular communities and mines will
have to be negotiated and implemented on a continuing basis in close consultation with those
communities.
Future Challenges
7.    The major challenges which remain to be addressed under ESMP include the implementation of
environmental remedial actions, internalizing a full-fledged community participation process, and
developing and implementing a viable income restoration strategy for the project affected people.
8.    Environmental Remedial Actions. Coal India has met all of the targets agreed with the Bank to
develop and introduce new policies and procedures for the implementation of EAPs (Tables 4.3.2-4.3.3).
Despite this progress, Coal India still has to enhance capacity at each of the twenty-five mines to monitor
various environmental parameters, share this information with the public, and, wherever necessary,
implement environmental remedial measures such as reclamation of post-mine land, bioreclamation of
overburden dumps, and top-soil conservation and utilization. Furthermore, in the course of supervision
between February 5 and May 1, 1997, Bank staff identified the incompleteness in monitoring indicators
for the environmental aspects of the project. This has also been noted by the NGOs. As a result and to
remedy this, strengthened monitoring indicators are being incorporated into the CSRP as a part of the
cross-conditionality.2 Environmental conditions in and around the project mines remain sub-standard and
pose other challenges. EAPs financed under the project are designed to address these problems.
9.    Community Participation is an area of significant challenge. Coal India's management admits
that its staff needs to develop a capacity for greater involvement of the project-affected people in the
decision-making process. Coal India has initiated the measures to improve its performance in community
involvement by establishing a continuous process of formal and informal training of staff, consensus
building and awareness raising workshops for its personnel who work in the mines and at subsidiary
2   Specific covenanted understandings on indicators and benchmarks will be agreed at negotiations for CSRP.

headquarters, and staff who are in the direct contact with project-affected people. NGOs which have
credibility in the local communities have been retained by Coal India to facilitate the consensus building
and partnership development between the project-affected people and the subsidiary staff.
10.   Even with increased mobilization of Coal India staff and the involvement of NGOs, experience
in India and elsewhere shows that the community participation process will not produce tangible results
immediately: some time will be necessary for the process to be fully internalized by all the stakehollders
and for it to take root in the day-to-day activities of project implementation at the village level. The Bank
advised Coal India to defer civil works in the resettlement and IPDP villages until proper community
participation processes were established to include the project-affected people, NGOs, and community
based organizations (CBOs). These prerequisites - which include the posting of Resettlement and
Rehabilitation and Community Development Officers and facilitating NGOs to all the mines,
appointment of supervision and review panels - have been fulfilled and the process of construction can
now proceed.
11.   The lack of meaningful consultations between Coal India and its subsidiaries with project
affected people and other stakeholders has led to several difficult situations. For example, the staff of
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd. (MCL) after little or no consultations with project-affected people, proceeded
with the development of resettlement village. Plots have been laid out, and roads, storm water drains
electricity supply, a school and village health center, and shops have been provided. However, very few
families have moved to these villages, taken possession of their plots, or begun construction of their
homes.
12.   At Parej East coal mine of the Central Coalfields Ltd. (CCL), a conflict developed between CCL
and project-affected people which necessitated police and court interventions. Project-affected people
refused to move from the land acquired by CCL because they were not consulted on the location and site
designed for the resettlement village. With enhanced consultations, two alternative sites have been
identified and it appears that a solution is being found to this problem.
13.   Income Restoration Strategy. The provision of permanent jobs for project-affected people has
been the traditional means of rehabilitation used by Coal India. This is no longer possible because (GOI
has withdrawn subsidies to Coal India, and the corporation is in the process of reducing its labor force. In
addition, because of the increasing scarcity of readily available land in many areas, the land-for-land
option for rehabilitation is not likely to be a practical choice in many cases. Therefore, a significant
challenge for Coal India is to develop a viable strategy for income restoration for project-affected people.
Such a strategy, which is now being developed by Coal India with NGO assistance, will encompass a
variety of options including: self-employment, training for project-affected people and their family
members, funding for self-employment and community savings schemes, as well as targeted annuity
programs which would, with proper design and safeguards, allow for the necessary support to project-
affected people to regain their pre-project living standards. Income restoration strategy will also be
applied to about one hundred persons identified to be below the poverty line who had been affected by
the previously Bank-financed coal projects.
Lessons Learned
14.    One of the major lessons learned so far from this experience is that the development of two free-
standing operations to address environment, social, and sector rehabilitation issues in the coal sector, and
the early approval of the mitigation project, provided an incentive for the Borrower to focus on those



Annex 4.3
Page 4 of 10
aspects of coal sector development which may otherwise have received insufficient attention in the
context of one large integrated project.
Information Sharing with NGOs
15.   While preparing this Note, the Bank shared information on the ESMP implementation status
with international and India-based non-governmental organizations. NGOs contributed to the Coal
India's and the Bank's understanding of the problems by reporting on the developments and making
suggestions for improving the situation in particular mines. Specific suggestions, to improve monitoring
of the environmental aspects of the project, have been taken into account in devising the proposed cross-
conditionalities between the ESMP and CSRP. As a part of this on-going process of outreach to, and
sharing written materials with the NGOs, the Bank also organized a series of meetings:
(a)    On April 16, 1997, the Office of the Indian Executive Director organized a briefing of
the NGOs in Washington in relation to the visit to the World Bank by Mr. Bagchee, the
Secretary for Coal, GOI, Mr. Sengupta, Coal India Chairman and the members of their
team;
(b)    On April 30, 1997, briefing of Chotanagpur Adivasi Sewa Samiti (CASS), a field NGO,
by the Social Development Unit Chief, took place in Rajrappa, Bihar;
(c)    On April 30, 1997, a briefing of NGOs by Bank staff on Indian energy policy issues and
their relation to the ESMP and the proposed CSRP took place in Washington;
(d)    On May 9, 1997, a meeting took place in the World Bank's Paris Office, attended by the
representatives of, inter alia, Berne Declaration, Minewatch, Friends of the Earth,
Amnesty International, Bretton Woods Project, and World Bank Reform.
Conclusion
16.   Despite the remaining challenges noted and in view of the efforts made by CIL to establish an
adequate structure for project implementation, momentum has been established and the prognosis for the
successful implementation of the ESMP is favorable. Further delay in initiating the specific investments
under the proposed CSRP is clearly no longer justified. Delay could only result in a loss of the
momentum already gained in developing institutional capacity, and thus retard the progress on the
operational framework for social and environmental remediation.
17.   The Bank will invite GOI and Coal India to negotiate the proposed CSRP as soon as the
conditions of negotiations relating to CSRP are met.

ANNEX 6.1 FINANCIAL MODEL, ASSUMPTIONS AND PROJECTIONS
Impact of Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project
1.    It is apparent that significant external inputs are needed to transform Coal India into a commercially
viable enterprise. These comprise an infusion of external finance of about US$1 billion, decontrol of
domestic coal prices, phasing out of subsidies to loss-making subsidiaries, reduction of surplus labor,
improvement in utilization of existing system capacity, and waiver and/or conversion of arrear loans and
interest liabilities into equity by Government. These measures work together to ensure that the end objective
of financial independence is achieved. None of these measures in isolation can produce the desired effect.
Projections of production, profit before tax and the debt service coverage ratio and the financial importance
of the project are illustrated in Figure 6.1. 1. It is clear that without the loan Coal India's production will
stagnate, its profits will decline and its ability to service its debt will be undermined. The loan program
together with the other measures are all necessary and need to be implemented soon to enable Coal India to
achieve long-term financial stability. In turn Coal India will need to revise many of its internal policies and
practices if the beneficial effect of these measures are to be sustained.

Internal Financial Flows
2.     The financial flows between Coal India and its eight wholly owned subsidiary companies have in
the past been somewhat informal and were more akin to the practice followed by a corporation whose
operations are structured in divisions. The sole principle governing the flows between Coal India and its
subsidiaries can only be described as 'from each according to its ability and to each according to its
requirement.' These arrangements blur the legal definition or boundary of each subsidiary, hide the extent of
cross subsidization and undermine management incentive and staff morale. The subsidiary companies of
Coal India comprise:
(a)    profitable companies such as MCL, NCL and SECL
(b)    marginally profitable companies such as CCL, WCL
(c)    highly loss-making companies such as ECL and BCCL
CMPDI is an in-house planning and design institute which undertakes mine planning and geological
exploration on behalf of the seven coal producing subsidiaries on a cost recovery basis.
3.     The first group of companies remit to Coal India all surpluses comprising internal cash generation
and disbursements from tied or project specific loans less any increase in capital investments and working
capital. These resources, together with budgetary support from the Government and market borrowings



Annex 6.1
Page 2 of 24
through the issue of bonds, fixed deposits, etc., and short-term bank credit for working capital, constitute
the resource base for Coal India enabling it to meet the following commitments:
(a)    consolidated debt service obligations to the Government, market indebtedness and bank
credit and
(b)    cash shortfall of loss-making companies resulting from both their capital expenditure
program and operating losses.
4.    The following practices have been used to determine, regulate and manage the financial flows
between Coal India and its subsidiary companies:
(a)    until recently, a retention price mechanism was in operation among the coal producing
companies. The Ministry of Coal specified the retention price applicable for each subsidiary
coal company. This price was below that realized by the profit-making companies and
higher than that of loss-making companies. Profit-making companies were therefore
required to contribute the excess of the realized price over retention price on the total
outside coal dispatches to the Coal Price Regulation Account (CPRA) which was
maintained centrally by Coal India. The aggregate of these credits was used to settle the
claims of the loss-making subsidiaries under the scheme. The contributions to, or claims
against, the CPRA were regarded as a tax deductible business expenditure or taxable income
in the hands of the individual subsidiary companies and have been used by Coal India to
minimize the group's tax liability;
(b)    cash surpluses of profitable companies have been used to accelerate loan repayments of
these companies to Coal India who in turn used these to substitute, and in effect subsidize,
the debt service obligations of the loss-making subsidiaries in order to keep them current;
(c)    Coal India's aggregate interest liability is allocated to subsidiary companies on the basis of
the proportionate investment made by Coal India in each of these companies;
(d)    all financial transactions between Coal India and its subsidiaries are recorded through
current accounts. Adjustments for CPRA or interest, as well as capital expenditure incurred
by Coal India on behalf of subsidiaries, are made through credits/debits in this account; and
(e)    upon the receipt of equity capital from Government, Coal India issues equity to its
subsidiaries. The current account balance at the end of each financial year, after adjustment,
is considered as a loan from Coal India to its subsidiary companies.
5.    The magnitude of the financial flows between Coal India and its subsidiary for the year ending
March 1996 is summarized in Table 6.1.1. This table highlights:
(a)   the substantial financial dependence of ECL and BCCL on the other companies, and
(b)   the continuing investment by Coal India in ECL and BCCL at the expense of the profit-
making companies.

* repayment of interest and principal of loan from BCCL to Coal India was larger than the subsidies received through CPRA in 1996.
** including transfer of interest waiver of Rs3,890 million and Rs5,028 million to ECL and BCCL out of the waiver received from the Govemment.
6.      One of the main objectives of the loan program (outlined in Annex 4.1) is to enable Coal India to
consolidate its financial position and those of its subsidiary companies by commercializing its operations,
preventing or limiting the transfer of resources from profitable subsidiaries to the two loss-making
subsidiaries, BCCL and ECL and redirecting its resources into the development of profitable coal reserves.
These financial transfers take place without the benefit of formal legal agreements, while the transactions
are recorded in the current account. This cross subsidization deprives profitable companies of resources to
expand their operations, prevents Coal India from holding each subsidiary accountable for its performance
by obscuring financial performance of each subsidiary, does not provide positive incentive to profitable
subsidiaries by limiting growth and undermines financial discipline on loss-making subsidiaries by
allowing them to continue loss-making operations.
Corporatization of subsidiary companies
7.      To address these deficiencies Coal India has decided to enhance the financial independence of its
subsidiaries and financially segregate the loss-making subsidiaries from profit-making subsidiaries. Under
this structure, Coal India will remain as a holding company, while its subsidiaries will become financially
autonomous and operate as independent profit centers. This corporatization program will be implemented
with effect from April 1, 1997 incorporating the following principles:
(a)     all financial transactions between Coal India and its subsidiaries or between its subsidiaries
will take place in terms of formal contractual arrangements specifying the terms and
conditions of those transactions;
(b)     financial transactions between Coal India and its subsidiaries will be limited to those
relating to equity, loan and service charges that may be levied by Coal India;
(c)     Merger of part or all of the operation is considered inappropriate and BCCL, ECL and MCL
will instead be strengthened in 1997/98 by a once-off debt/equity swap (see para 13). This
will be offset by the reverse swap in the other subsidiaries;
(d)     Coal India and its subsidiaries will complete the debt/equity swap and prepare the new
accounts by March 31, 1998.
(e)     terms on loans from Coal India to its subsidiaries will be market-related with exception of
specific loans to BCCL and ECL forming part of the financial restructuring packages;
(f)     the repayment period of Coal India's loan to its subsidiaries will be identical to Coal India's
original loans from external lenders;



Annex 6.1
Page 4 of 24
(g)     Coal India's subsidiaries will raise external resources directly from the market against their
own creditworthiness, with Coal India acting as a facilitator;
(h)     Coal India and its subsidiaries, excluding BCCL and ECL during their restructuring period
(FY1998 - FY2000), will maintain a debt to total capitalization ratio of no more than 60 to
40 (debt/net equity+debt) and a debt service ratio (total cashflows/debt service) larger than
1.3;
(i)     Coal India will limit its corporate guarantees to profit making companies and then only after
consultation with the Bank; and
(j)    the subsidiaries will be required to pay dividends out of profit within the framework of the
dividend policy and resources in excess of investment requirements.
8.     Redefining the relationship between Coal India and its subsidiaries in a manner that recognizes them
as separate legal entities is an essential step in corporatizing the subsidiaries. Financial flows between Coal
India and its subsidiaries should arise thereafter mainly because of specific debt servicing obligations,
receipt of equity and the need to borrow from Coal India. Investment of funds borrowed by Coal India and
on lent to subsidiary companies should entail a formal back-to-back debt servicing arrangement between
Coal India and the recipient. Subsidiary companies' access to borrowed funds from Coal India (acting
merely as an intermediary) must therefore conform to the constraints of their individual borrowing capacity
and ability to service debt. The fundamental change in strategic direction assumes added importance in view
the weakness of ECL and BCCL and of the Government's resolve to curtail all budgetary support to Coal
India in the future.
9.      The capital structure of the subsidiary companies at the end of March 1996 is shown in Table 6.1.2.
On the basis of a 60% debt to total capital ratio, ECL, BCCL and MCL have exhausted their ability to
borrow further funds. MCL is a new operation in the process of expansion and the apparent problem of
limited debt capacity is therefore largely transitory. The situation for ECL and BCCL on the other hand will
deteriorate further in view of the continued erosion in their net equity base as a result of projected ongoing
losses. Without substantial restructuring, there is no possibility of these companies regaining their
borrowing capacity or viability in the years to come.

10.    The second step in the corporatization process is to restore the company's borrowing capacity to the
extent possible. This will require a comprehensive restructuring of the capital base of all subsidiaries as the
ratio of debt to total capital for Coal India (including its subsidiaries) is 53.6% as of March 1996. The
additional aggregate borrowing capacity available for the group as a whole is therefore 6.5% of its total
capital base i.e. of the order of Rs8 billion. This together with the restructuring of Coal India's capital base
by the Government in 1996/97 leaves some scope for improving the capital structure of ECL and BCCL
and, to a lesser extent, MCL.



Annex 6.1

Restructuring of Coal India's capital base
11.    A major component of Coal India's debt to the Government was represented by arrear repayments
of loans and accrued interest, amounting to RsI3.37 billion (US$382 million) and Rs8.92 billion (US$255
million) respectively as at March 1996. This was mainly due to the administered coal price being
historically inadequate together with the persistent default on coal sales by State Electricity Boards (SEBs).
While fairly regular price increases and the price deregulation recently adopted by the Government has
enabled Coal India to meet its current obligations (since 1992), the company was not able to settle its arrear
liabilities. As a consequence, it sought and was given significant relief by the Government by way of:
(a)     waiver of arrears of interests amounting to Rs8.92 billion (Rs5 billion for BCCL and Rs3.9
billion for ECL) effective March 31,1996;
(b)     conversion of arrears in loan repayment amounting to Rs9.04 billion into 10% non-
cumulative Preference Equity which are redeemable in 2004; and
(c)     a moratorium of three years on repayment and accrued interest of outstanding non-plan
loan of Rs4.3 billion (Totaling Rs1.7 billion and Rs2.6 billion BCCL for ECL respectively).
The loan will to be repaid in three annual installments 1999/2000 onwards with interest
accruing from April 1999.
12.    The base case financial model accounts for the restructuring of Government debt of Rs22.29 billion
and assumes that this relief has been specifically allocated to the financially weak companies with high
levels of debt (ECL, BCCL and CCL). This, together with additional internal financial rearrangements
described below, will strengthen the balance sheet of each subsidiary, reestablish their capacity to borrow
within prudent limits and lay the foundation for independent operation and corporatization of each
subsidiary.
13.    Coal India has decided to further restructure the balance sheet of its subsidiaries during the course
of 1997/98 and will comprise the transfers between debt and equity accounts within each subsidiary. This
will not affect the interests of the Government or other parties and should therefore present little difficulty.
Although debt to equity swaps can be implemented by Coal India without legal recourse, the corresponding
equity to debt swap involves a reduction in equity capital in the case of WCL, NCL and SECL which will
need formal sanction under the Companies Act (1956). The combined capital restructuring that has been
used for the base case financial model is illustrated in Table 6.1.3.

Reorganization Plan for ECL and BCCL
14.   The financial weakness of BCCL and ECL has been recognized by GOI and Coal India for a long
time (combined losses amounted to Rs8.2 billion, Rsl 1.4 billion and Rs6.1 billion in 1994, 1995 and 1996,
respectively). Attaining financial viability of these companies is critical to the success of the corporatization
program being pursued by Coal India. Jointly these two companies employ around 50% of Coal India's
work-force (309,000 as of March 30, 1996) and produce only 23% of the Coal India's production (see
cumulative cost curve in Figure 2.2). This situation is not sustainable, it represents a severe drain on
resources, a risk to Coal India's financial stability and threatens the project objective of enhancing Coal
India's ability to increase profitable coal production through proper commercialization of its operations.
15.   Recognizing on the one hand that it can no longer afford the massive subsidies of the past and on the
other its social responsibility to a bloated workforce, Coal India have decided to revive ECL and BCCL by
undertaking major restructuring. This adjustment will be implemented over an extended period of 10 years
given the acute social constraint. The magnitude of this constraint can be gauged by the simple fact that
more than some 1.5 million people depend on the economic activities of these two subsidiaries, assuming an
average family size of five. In addition, mining operations in remote areas provide most of the social
infrastructure (house, schools, hospitals, electricity, fuel and water) and primary job opportunities.
16.   Although the measures and financial relief approved by government and implemented in 1996/97
are necessary to create the financial capacity for change, they merely address past imbalances and are
insufficient to stem the financial decline or provide the framework for a sustainable recovery. A
comprehensive reorganization plan will further require (i) Government to fund a voluntary retirement
scheme (VRS), (ii) CIL to undertake the recapitalization of ECL and BCCL, provide a grant for the
implementation of well focused and rigidly applied VRS, provide interim bridging finance for replacement
capital and a moratorium on debt service, and (iii) ECL and BCCL to reduce their labor force, improve
operational efficiency and close uneconomic mines by introducing VRS to redundant labor. Under these
conditions it is projected that these companies can be turned around over the next four to six years as
outlined in Tables 6.1.4 and 6.1.5. This strategy will require considerable management commitment and
attention to detail, a capital infusion and additional investment. The components of this plan comprise:
(a)    Cost Reduction Measures by ECL and BCCL. In return for financial assistance from
Coal India, ECL and BCCL have undertaken to:
(i)    ensure productivity and cost improvements comprising:
a.    progressive reduction of work-force through (i) natural attrition; (ii)
implementation of voluntary retirements selectively applied to the
redundancies arising from the closure of uneconomic operations by utilizing
a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) which will be financed by way of a
grant from Coal India, and (iii) limited recruitment. The rate of natural
attrition is estimated to be 3% per annum. Recruitment will be strictly
limited to a maximum of 20% of natural attrition and then only to provide
for death-in-service, incapacitation or terminal illness and compensation for
land acquisition needs. To restore their profitability it is estimated that they
will require a sum of Rs3 billion each over the period 1997 to 1999 to be
expended on VRS alone. Net labor compliment will as a result be reduced
from 147,439 in 1996 to 114,500 in 2006 for BCCL and from 161,675 in
1996 to 132,957 in 2006 for ECL; and
b.    Capacity utilization for each these companies was only 67% in 1995/96.
There is significant scope for improvement to at least the levels prevailing
in other subsidiaries. ECL and BCCL have undertaken to accelerate this



Annex 6.1
Page 7 of 24
improvement over the next two years to reach a target of 85% and thereafter
at a more gradual rate (see Table 6.1.4).
(ii)   Improve working capital management. At present both companies are highly
illiquid having amassed sizable wage and pension arrears, and are experiencing
difficulty in meeting daily commitments. The estimated 1996/97 current ratio is
only 0.51 and 1.02 for ECL and BCCL respectively; and
(iii)   Restrict investment only to profitable projects (at least 16% FRR in real terms), and
close uneconomic mines. This will permit the redeployment of mobile equipment in
an attempt to increase the overall capacity utilization by reducing the existing
imbalance in capacity between production and internal transport of coal.
(b)    Restructuring the liabilities to Coal India. The waiver of interest of Rs8.92 billion
received by Coal India from the Govt., has been passed on to ECL (Rs3.89 billion) and
BCCL (Rs5.03 billion) in full. Besides Coal India has decided within its corporatization
framework to:
(i)    Convert debt amounting Rs9.94 billion for ECL and Rsl 1.81 billion for BCCL into
equity which restores net worth, avoids technical bankruptcy, reduces future debt
servicing and creates the capacity to borrow from the holding company without
exceeding a debt/capitalization ratio of 60%; and
(ii)    Charge ECL and BCCL GOI's original interest rates, which are lower than
commercial rates of interest, on the residual of their existing loan account (capital
restructuring) amounting to Rs7.18 billion and Rs4.81 billion for ECL and BCCL as
at end March 1996 respectively);
(c)    Bridging Finance provided by Coal India. Notwithstanding the capital restructuring,
ECL and BCCL, without a reliable profit record, are unable to borrow in the market. In the
absence of CPRA receipts and a corporate guarantee from Coal India (see para 7) these
companies will require considerable financial support from their shareholders during the
transition towards profitability. To ensure the survival of these companies Coal India has
decided within its corporatization framework to:
(i)    Extend short- to medium-term cash support either by way of loans or equity to
enable ECL and BCCL to meet their debt service obligations to Coal India and
undertake sufficient capital replacements to maintain the level of production. This
support will be conditional upon ECL and BCCL achieving annual targets in respect
of capacity utilization and labor reduction set by Coal India and will comprise:
a.     Loan and equity in equal proportions to fund replacement capital
expenditures. The loan portion will bear interest at the GOI rate of interest
and will enjoy a moratorium until 2006 before being repaid out of surplus
resources. These transfers will be financed out of dividends received from
Coal India's more profitable subsidiaries; and
b.     An additional revolving interest free bridging loan, financed from market
borrowings, to enable the companies to meet in full their debt service
obligations to Coal India, restore liquidity and settle arrears in wages,
accrued staff gratuities and other current liabilities. Consistent with the
corporatization program CIL will not issue any guarantees in respect of its
loss making subsidiaries and conform to the accepted debt covenants i.e.
D/E and debt service ratios 1.5 and 1.3 respectively.



Annex 6.1

(ii)   Independent of the source of finance, provide a grant to finance the implementation
of VRS amounting to Rs3 billion for each company. Although the rate of
disbursement will depend on the success of the scheme, it is likely that Rs600
million will be expended in 1997/98 and Rsl .2 billion in each of the following two
years. This will be financed partly from the NRF receipts and borrowings to the
extent necessary.
(d)    Government Support. In acknowledging ultimate responsibility, Government have waived
certain ECL and BCCL arrears, converted debt into preference equity, have provided a
moratorium on the repayment of principal and interest, and will address its social
commitment and the past financial distortions by:
(i)    allowing Coal India to regularly increasing the price of regulated coal in accordance
with the BICP pricing mechanism. An increase of 29% is scheduled for 1997/98 to
offset the unrecovered cost increases since the last price revision in November
1993; and
(ii)    providing a grant to Coal India to assist with the funding of a VRS in ECL and
BCCL amounting to Rs4 billion (US$112 million) and financed out of the National
Renewal Fund (NRF).
17.    Although the success of the above measures would help ECL and BCCL substantially improve their
financial performance, it will take a considerable time for these remedial measures to enable ECL and
BCCL to regain their viability, restore their liquidity and capacity to access outside credit and invest in
expanded productive capacity, and then only if these measures are rigidly adhered to and implemented
without delay. Indeed if this is not done, ECL and BCCL will dissipate the benefits of the restructuring as
indicated in Figure 6.1.2 below and almost certainly will continue to need support from Coal India.

18.    The projections show that both these companies can be expected to earn modest profits of about
Rs 1.0 billion per annum from 2001, repay inter-company borrowings by 2004 and begin to access external
credit and expand production from 2005 onwards. This recovery, albeit modest, will substantially mitigate
the financial risk which these companies pose to the other group companies, it provides the time to deal
effectively with redundant labor and safeguards the livelihood of a substantial workforce dependent upon
the survival of these companies. Prior to negotiations, Coal India submitted restructuring plans of BCCL and
ECL, together with their action plans. Coal India intends to recruit a consulting team to further improve the
plans and to prepare detailed implementation plans.

Coal India's base case financial projections
19.      Assumptions. The financial model is structured to provide an income statement, balance sheet and
funds flow in current prices for a 10 year period, the base year being 1996/97. These statements are
generated for each coal producing subsidiary. The results have been consolidated to reflect the overall
financial position of Coal India. The financial model is based on:
(a)       Estimated production capacity, manpower, stripping ratio, labor productivity, average coal
price realized, wage cost per employee, variable and fixed operating expenses, interest and
depreciation, and a provision for compensation per person for accepting early retirement.
The average coal price includes the value added resulting from washeries and other
downstream operations. Production capacity is identified separately for underground and



Annex 6.1
Page 11 of 24
opencast mines and includes, in some cases such as ECL, uncommissioned capacity created
through substantial investments in prior years.
(b)    Assumptions have been made regarding likely trends of physical performance, manpower
reduction, the cost of creating new capacity and servicing of existing capacity through
replacements, working capital management and likely enhancement of bank credit, various
sources of borrowing and other financial assumptions relating to the impact of the expected
change in average quality of production on realizable price, tax adjustment for depreciation,
and capital restructuring.
(c)    Coal prices which are progressively being deregulated: coking coal and superior grade non-
coking coal from March 1996 and other grades within the next three years. Price increases
due to Coal India's ability to capture part of the existing market premium for coal quality,
has been assumed for each subsidiary company as a result of decontrol of coking coal and
superior grade non coking coal. The regulated grades D, E, F and G are priced according to
Government notification dated June 1994 which reflects costs as prevailing in November
1993. Following deregulation of Grade D and the issue of Government notification
empowering Coal India increase prices of other grades on BICP formula, a major increase
in prices of these grades was approved in 1997. An increase of 29% has been used for the
purpose of projection.
(d)    The cost of new capacity creation is estimated to be Rs330 per cubic meter in opencast
mines and Rs950 per ton in underground mines at 1996 prices. The capacity creation cost
per ton in opencast mines is determined on the basis of the stripping ratio and specific
gravity of coal. The weighted average cost takes into account the future profile of
opencast/underground projects in each company.
(e)    cross-subsidization (CPRA) will be discontinued from the current year as a consequence of
price decontrol of certain grades which dominates the production mix of the loss making
companies receiving subsidies through the CPRA mechanism. With claims under CPRA
restricted only to coal of regulated grades becoming marginal for ECL & BCCL, the CPRA
has ceased to be an effective vehicle of cross- subsidization. The success of other measures,
such as the release of grants for implementing Coal India's voluntary retirement program,
debt forgiveness, price increases due to decontrol, and the internal steps initiated by Coal
India to improve efficiency, may not enable ECL and BCCL to become profitable
companies unless these measures are complimented by a program to phase out uneconomic
operations and provide golden hand shake to the resultant surplus workforce. Coal India's
strategy in this regard is to extend as much support as possible as a one time measure by
way of capital restructuring and partial price decontrol, phase out cross subsidization
thereafter and require the companies to set their own survival strategies in consultation with
BIFR which could include closure of uneconomic operations, accelerated VRS, limiting or
deferring wage revisions and redundancies. Indeed such decisions will need high degree of
political consensus and should be dealt with the prime agency in the country responsible for
handling potential insolvency, namely BIFR. This intervention is considered essential to
ensure the expeditious and smooth implementation of such actions.
(f)    Coal India's access to operating surpluses of the profitable companies shall be strictly
restricted to receipt of dividends on a reasonable payout ratio and interest bearing loans
under formally executed contracts. A payout ratio (dividend/PAT) of 40% is provided for
NCL, WCL, MCL and SECL on the basis of sustainability of profit growth. On the same
basis, the payout ratio for CCL has been limited to 10%. In addition, 10% dividend on
preference equity is provided for MCL, NCL and SECL for back-to-back payment by Coal
India to the Government. Out of dividends on ordinary equity, Coal India shall, for the time



Annex 6.1
Page 12 of 24
being, retain 80% for providing support in various forms to ECL and BCCL as part of the
reorganization plan. The balance of 20% shall be paid by way of dividend to the
Government.
(g)    besides being subject to a limit of 60% of debt to total capital, it has been assumed that the
borrowing capacity for each subsidiary will be constrained by an annual borrowing limit
which will be significantly lower if the coal sector loan does not take place.
(h)   the model provides for estimates of domestic and foreign inflation, inflationary adjustment
of coal price, and a wage index reflecting adjustment for inflation and the possible outcome
of wage negotiations which are held once every four years. Further exchange rate
depreciation arising from differential rates of inflation has also been taken into account.
20.   Other quantitative assumptions are shown in Table 6.1.6.

21.      Financial projections. On this basis and the assumptions outlined in Table 6.1.6, detailed
projections for each subsidiary company have been made and are contained in the project file. The
consolidated results for all producing companies are given in detail on pages 22 to 24 of this annex and
summarized in Table 6.1.7. Although the financial ratios indicate a steady return to financial health for the
group as a whole, it is apparent that ECL and BCCL, although regaining profitability, will need to eliminate
its loss making activities and carefully review is labor requirements.

22.     The financial model has been structured in a manner which provides an opportunity for Coal India
to identify factors which are of critical importance for the financial health of Coal India and the success of
the CSRP. These comprise:
(a)     CAPITAL RESTRUCTURING BY GOVERNMENT. Government conversions of arrear liabilities
into equity was a necessary but not sufficient condition to fully mitigate the financial
distress of ECL and BCCL and to provide time for them to be transformed into
commercially self-sustaining and viable units. The model assumes that further support is
made by way of equity and concessionary loans derived from a portion of the dividends
received by Coal India from its other subsidiary companies and recourse by Coal India to
external credits. The magnitude of this transitional support is outlined in Table 6.1.9.

* After accounting for interest waiver of Rs3,890 million and Rs5,027.5 million
for ECL and BCCL, respectively.
Given sufficient operational improvement, financial restructuring and adequate transitional
support, ECL and BCCL should be able to avert bankruptcy, restore positive net worth and
remain within prudent borrowing limits as highlighted in Figure 6.1.3.

(b)    SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY IN ECL AND BCCL. One of the main
factors contributing to the improvement of ECL and BCCL is the better utilization of
existing capacity. The utilization of the existing capacity is planned for improvement on an
accelerated scale to 85% and thereafter on a moderated scale to 95% (90% for ECL and
BCCL). The measures being implemented for achieving these improvements include:
(i)    upgrading the quality of productive assets by global sourcing of equipment;
(ii)   improving machine availability by proper management of spares and workshop
facilities;
(iii)  improving operator availability by introducing "hot seat change" and mobile
canteens; and
(iv)   in ECL and BCCL, redeployment of productive assets from uneconomic operations
identified for closure, to other mines with a need for such assets.
(c)    DECONTROL OF COAL PRICES. Price decontrol will be a major contributing factor to the
process of attaining long-term commercial viability by the coal companies. Decontrol
enables the companies to charge a price which is related to the net back import price
adjusted for variations in coal quality and will enable ECL and BCCL in particular to
benefit substantially from 1997 onwards.
(d)    GROWTH IN DEMAND. To support the country's economic reforms and its projected growth
in GDP and exports of 5% and 20% respectively, the coal sector will need to expand at the
rate of 8% per annum (see para 1.06). The base case projections indicate that Coal India will
be unable to satisfy this demand and it is assumed that 40% of the incremental increase will
be met by the private sector and imports. Allocation among individual companies is based
upon regional opportunity and comparative economics. As a consequence, the growth of
MCL with easy mining conditions, availability of viable projects and spare capacity, has
been favored at the expense of SECL and WCL. In the longer term however, Coal India is
unable to finance in full the required increase in capacity and is projected to produce only
3231 million tons per year in 2006 against a market demand of 420 million tons.
23.   In addition to these critical factors requiring appropriate action, the company needs to undertake the
following internal measures and reforms:
(a)    restrict the intake of fresh manpower,
Net of production derived from hired earth moving machinery and contractors amounting to around 23 million ton per annum.



Annex 6.1
Page 17 of 24
(b)    improve the collection of revenue receipts,
(c)    reduce the inventory of coal and stores and spares,
(d)    avoid time and cost over run in implementing projects, and
(e)    close unprofitable operations and restrict new investments to commercially viable projects.
Improvement of operating efficiency
24.    The existing levels of operating efficiency in most cases is around 70%-85% of the corporate norm
defined by CMPDI. The reasons for this suboptimal performance are numerous and include: the low level of
capital replacement in recent years and the tacit requirement that Coal India buys equipment from
indigenous manufacturers in the public and private sectors. This has severely restricted Coal India's ability
to access international technology and equipment of global quality standards. CSRP will allow Coal India to
replace existing equipment in large mines with units of globally accepted quality and specifications. This
process should enable the coal companies to improve the utilization of existing capacity progressively to a
level of 95% of the normative capacity. Coal India has undertaken to develop an action plan outlining in
detail how these levels are to be achieved. The disproportionate impact and importance of these efficiency
improvements on the projected consolidated net profits of Coal India is shown in Figure 6.1.4.

25.    The survival of the marginal companies of ECL and BCCL are particularly sensitive to these
improvements. To the extent that these are not achieved and production falls short of the levels projected, a
further reduction in the labor compliment will be required to levels which may well be beyond Coal India's
capacity to achieve without additional assistance or support from the Government.
Restricted intake of fresh manpower
26.   All coal companies and ECL and BCCL in particular, must seek every opportunity to redeploy
surplus labor within and between group companies before the fresh intake of manpower is considered. In
order to achieve this objective, it is necessary that the recruitment policy of each company is significantly
revised. The components of the existing policy that should be abolished are the employment of: (i) a
dependent of any employee suffering from "general debility;" and (ii) land losers as compensation for land
acquired for new projects. Without budgetary support, the company can no longer afford to perpetuate these
policies. Adoption of a revised policy for resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people will
provide Coal India with an ideal opportunity to cease the practice of hiring land losers by offering them
attractive cash alternatives. Employment of dependents of existing employees as a social security measure



Annex 6.1
Page 18 of 24
should be limited and ultimately replaced by other means such as life insurance, pension provisions or other
lump-sum cash alternatives. Existing wage agreements will need to be renegotiated and amended to effect
this as early as possible.
27.   A reduced labor compliment and an increase in operating efficiencies will lead to a reduction in
costs and enable the company to approach a working ratio of 0.8 over a period of five years. The financial
consequences of not achieving this goal are severe and will almost certainly result in the insufficient internal
generation of cash, reinvestment of funds in productive capacity and inability to meet debt obligations.
Consequently, each of the subsidiary companies should be obligated under the terms of the CSRP to achieve
and maintain a working ratio of 0.8.
Project implementation
28.   In the past, the implementation of projects by the coal companies resulted in delays and cost
overruns. It is essential for individual coal companies to have adequate project management and on-line
systems for monitoring project implementation so that capital costs are contained within the budget. The
cost of capacity creation has been assumed as Rs930/ton in underground mines and Rs33O/m3 for opencast
mines - both at 1995/96 prices. These are reasonably comfortable estimates although cost overrun arising
from time overrun may push costs beyond these estimates which in turn may jeopardize financial viability.
29.   The base case financial model demonstrates the possibility of all the companies, with the exception
of ECL and BCCL, Coal India as a whole attaining long-term financial viability, provided the following
remedial measures are taken by the Government and Coal India:
Action by the Government
(a)    deregulation of coal price of lower grades of coal within the next three years;
(b)   indirect support by permitting the controlled use of a portion of the dividend flow to finance
loans to ECL and BCCL, and the implementation of a voluntary retirement scheme;
(c)   systematic application of the BICP pricing mechanism to provide a regular and adequate
increase in regulated coals; and
(d)    continue to ensure and enforce noninterference in Coal India's efforts to regulate coal
supplies on commercial considerations, i.e. timely payment and insistence on inventory
buildup by consumers.
Action by Coal India
(a)    ensure the independent operation of each subsidiary and eliminate cross subsidization;
(b)    devise and implement a time bound action plan for improving equipment utilization to level
of 95% for each company;
(c)   regulate coal supplies and ensure payment of dues by entering into legally enforceable
supply contracts with penalty/bonus provisions;
(d)    encourage inventory buildup by consumers;
(e)    adopt a system of identification and disposal of non-moving items in stores and spares on a
continuous basis;
(f)    enter into long-term contracts with equipment manufacturers for supply of spares on a 'as
and when required' basis; and



Annex 6.1
Page 19 of 24
(g)    enforce improved system of project implementation.
Critical performance indicators
30.    To realize Coal India's financial, economic and operating objectives as outlined in the consolidated
financial projections will require each subsidiary to achieve and maintain a minimum level of performance.
These performance factors have been identified and are tabulated for 1997 to 2002 in Annex 5.1 for each
subsidiary company and for Coal India as a whole.
Financial and corporate risk
31.    The more significant factors impacting the base case financial forecast are the deregulated coal
price; unit capital cost, capacity utilization and production levels; funds tied up in working capital,
particularly accounts receivable; and differential cost increases. Table 6.1.10 summarizes the probability
distribution associated with each of these factors and the motivation for its selection. A detailed risk
analysis, using probabilistic simulation techniques, was performed on each of the six subsidiary companies
in an attempt to quantify to the extent possible:
(a)    the financial impact of the risks to which the

(b)    the areas in which Coal India management

(c)       improve its operating ratio from  existing levels to around the target level of 0.8 are
somewhat remote in the short to medium term. This target, however, will remain difficult to
maintain as long as the excessive labor levels and operating ratios of greater than 1.0 are
maintained at ECL and BCCL. In the absence of substantial improvement in operational
efficiencies, these operations will continue to struggle and undermine the financial
performance of Coal India.

regarded as somewhat conservative. Nonetheless a
uniform distribution of  10 percent has been used.
3. Annual increase in capacity                                                   Notwithstanding intense management effort to
utilization.                                                                    increase capacity utilization, there exists the
possibility of the program taking longer and
peaking at a different level than projected. The
assumed annual increases have accordingly been
varied by a factor contained in the adjacent
distribution.
4. Limit in capacity utilization                                                 The target utilization rate is 95 percent. Although
this is a normative rate, it is regarded as an
ambitious goal to achieve on a consistent basis.
Since there is a greater possibility of falling short of
the target, a triangular distribution skewed
somewhat to the left has been adopted.
5. Wage increase.                                                                A normal distribution varying within a narrow
range of 5 percent of those projected in the base
case.

6. Periodic wage adjustment.                                                      The base case assumes a wage adjustment of 8
percent will be negotiated with the unions every
four years. Management's strenuous efforts to
relate wage increases to productivity gains is likely
to result in these adjustments being lower than
projected. As a consequence a distribution skewed
slightly towards the lower levels has been used to
factor the base case assumption.

7. Increase in unit costs.                                                        The annual increase in unit cost is expected to vary
0              ^               |       by  7 percent of that originally assumed.
8. Accounts receivable.                                                           The projected reduction in, and maintenance of,
accounts receivable is considered to be fairly
ambitious given the weak nature of the power
sector. Accordingly the chances of more modest
decreases are more likely and the base case
assumption has been factored accordingly.

32.       EXCHANGE RATE RISK. Coal India and its subsidiaries will bear the exchange rate risk of the IBRD
US$ based single currency loan. Its ability to absorb this risk has been reflected in the projections by
adjusting the loan repayments by the differential exchange rate assumptions. Further devaluations are to a
large extent hedged. Its effects will be absorbed through the coal price mechanism since coal is
internationally traded and denominated in US$.

ANNEX 6.2 FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.    The following summarizes: (a) the methodology and assumptions that were used to estimate
financial and economic rates of return and net present value of the individual mnine-specific investments
and for the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project as a whole and; and (b) the results of the analysis. The
risks each mine-specific investment faces are taken explicitly into account.
Methodology and assumptions
2.    The financial and economic analysis of each mine subproject was carried out based on real prices
(1996-97). Cost and revenue streams were estimated for the project implementation period 1997/98 to
2001/02. The major variables affecting the cash flows are, inter alia, the capital cost, operating cost,
annual production and the selling price of coal.
3.    Table 6.2.1 summarizes the assumptions that have been used for carrying out the financial and
economic analysis of the mine-specific investments.
4.    The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), and the net present value (NPV) have been
calculated on the basis of incremental cost and benefit streams associated with each of the 24 mines
included in the proposed project. In addition to the fixed and variable costs affecting the cash flows,
project specific environmental and social mitigation costs have fully been taken into account in the
economic evaluation of the project.
5.    Financial benefits are estimated on the basis of incremental coal production valued at prevailing
coal prices. These prices reflect recent coal price increases. On April 1, 1997 Coal India increased prices
of coal grades D, E, F, and G by 24-29% for all subsidiary companies. With these price increases the
difference between the economic and financial prices for these mines has narrowed -- in the case of MCL
mines (producing grade F coal) and two WCL mines, viz., Durgapur and Padmapur (producing grade E
coals) the difference between the administrative prices and economic prices has come down to between
2% and 7% (from 27% to 36%).
6.    Economic benefits are estimated on the basis of revenue generated based on incremental coal
production valued at the lower of the following two ways. First, at the imported price of Australian coal
(c.i.f.) at selected Indian ports plus inland freight costs to consumers, and adjusted for equivalent heat
values, less the freight charges for delivery of coal from mine mouth to the same consumers. Second, on
the basis of Average Incremental Cost (AIC), appropriately adjusted for quality, to reflect consumers
willingness to pay. With the exception of two coking coal mines (Parej East, and Rajrappa) and one non-
coking coal mine (Umrer) producing high grade coal, incremental output of all other mines was valued at
prices based on the AIC method.



Annex 6.2
Page 2 of 7
7.    The import parity price and the economic price based on AIC were calculated as follows.
Import Parity Price: The following formula was used to compute the price.
Pi = IP*E*(G2/Gl) + X[(G2/G1)*F1-F2]-X(K+A)
Where:
IP    CIF price of imported coal in US$
E     Exchange rate
F,    Freight/Ton (financial prices) from port to consumer (market) in Rs
GI    Gross calorific value of imported coal (kcal/kg)
Pi    Import parity price of ith Indian coal at mine gate in Rs./Ton
G2    Gross calorific value of Indian coal (kcal/kg)
F2    Freight/Ton (financial prices) from mine to consumer in Rs.
K     Marketing margin (financial prices) as percentage of grade price /Ton
A     Ash handling cost/Ton (financial prices) in Rs.
X     Standard conversion factor
8.    Average incremental cost (AIC) based price: The AIC method has been used to calculate long-
run marginal cost (LRMC), taking into account specific characteristics of each mine as advised by
mining experts. It is calculated as a ratio of the total discounted value of yearwise cash outflows and the
total discounted production. It was assumed that the future projects of Coal India would be opencast
mines. These mines would apply technologies that ensure cost minimization ( a least-cost program) and
take advantage of economies of scale by employing predominantly, equipment of higher capacities.
9.    The cashflows of capital investment and operating cost have been estimated on the basis of
information available on specific investment in mines of comparable size. Appropriate contingency
provisions have been made to take into account the various uncertainties. Ash handling cost has been
added to the operating cost to reflect the externality associated with higher ash coal. The financial
costflows were converted into economic costflows by netting out taxes and duties and by employing the
standard conversion factors where necessary. A key variable in the derivation of AIC is the stripping
ratio. It is recognized that future mines will likely have different geo-mining conditions than at present.
Based on the expected geo-miming conditions the following stripping ratios (cubic meter/ton) were
assumed in the calculation for each company: MCL (2.5); SECL (3.0); CCL (3.0); NCL (4.0); and WCL
(4.5).
10.   Since costs do not vary with coal quality, the economic value to coal for each mine was derived
by adjusting for the heat value of coal. It was assumed that the base cost estimates represented the costs
of producing grade E coal.
11.   The derived economic price of steam coal produced from the project ranges from Rs376/ton to
Rs 1,090/ton. For steam coal, these prices are roughly between 2% to 58% higher than the prevailing
financial (administered in the case of coal grades E and lower) price levels. Prior to the April 1, 1997
price adjustments economic prices were roughly 27% to 84 % higher then financial prices. In the case of
coking coal, the resulting economic price comes out to be about 16% to 20% higher than prevailing
prices. A separate analysis has been done to observe how the overall project benefit stream is altered as
coal demand adjusts to increases in prices (from administered to economic levels).

Risk analysis
12.   The financial and economic returns of the proposed investment program are subject to several
uncertainties. To the extent that these uncertainties can be foreseen and quantified, they have been taken
into account in the financial and economic evaluation of the individual mine-specific investments. The
results of this analysis provide an indication of the risks that are associated with the investment program.
In addition, this analysis highlights areas where the implementing coal company can take steps to reduce
known risks. The following variables were taken into account in carrying out the risk analysis:
(a)    changes in the price of coal,
(b)    delays in implementation of the projects,
(c)    changes in capital cost,
(d)    changes in operating cost, and
(e)    changes in coal output
13.   Based on the available information on the nature of the variables and also on judgment, a
probability distribution for each of the variables was selected to reflect the uncertainty. A Monte Carlo
simulation was then carried out to generate a range of likely values for the different variables. The
simulation yielded a range of possible financial and economic internal rates of return and net present
values, and the likelihood of achieving each of them. Table 6.2.2 summarizes the details of the
probability distributions for different variables and the rationale for selecting them.
Results
14.   Tables 6.2.3 and 6.2.4 summarize the results of the financial and economic analysis respectively,
taking into account the risks described above. Results show:
(a)   that the investments for each of the 24 mines included in the project carry financial and
economic rates of return well in excess of 16% per year. The project as a whole yielded
positive expected financial NPV of US$945, at 16% discount rate, and expected
economic NPV of US$1,634 at the same discount rate.
(b)   that adjusting the economic benefit stream to include the impact of price increase (from
financial to economic levels) on coal demand reduces the economic NPVs, at 16%
discount rate by US$51 million (to US$1,583 million). A medium-term price elasticity
of coal demand of - 1 was used.
(c)   that 'internalizing the environmental and social mitigation costs have only a marginal
effect on the cost of coal production, and therefore, the economic viability of the project.
The main environmental effects identified (and assessed) under the ESMP include: air,
water, and noise pollution; land degradation; and overburden dumps. The main social
effect identified under the ESMP involves the resettlement and rehabilitation (including
land) of the project affected people. A total of 16, 310 persons will be effected by land
acquisition during project implementation. Of these 9,260 persons are above 18 years of
age, and would be rehabilitated under the project. The environmental and social
mitigation costs of 14 of the 24 mine subprojects and for the project as a whole are less
then 5% of total project costs. The high economic returns suggest that, if necessary, the
project can absorb additional environmental and social costs and still remain
economically viable.



Annex 6.2
Page 4 of 7
(d)      that the project as a whole yielded (at 80%  probability) positive expected financial NPV
(risk adjusted) of US$669, at 16% discount rate, and expected economic NPV of
US$1,282 at the same discount rate.
(e)      that all the subprojects yielded (at 80%  probability) positive expected financial and
economic NPVs at 16% discount rate after taking into account multiple and project
specific risks using Monte Carlo simulations. The exception is the Nigahi coal mine
project which yielded a risk adjusted financial NPV (at 16% discount rate) of zero. This
is because the pricing of Nigahi output has been done in a way that would yield a 16
percent rate of return at 85%  capacity utilization. The financial viability of Nigahi is
thus, contingent on it maintaining a capacity utilization rate in excess of 85%. Presently,
Nigahi is operating at 92% capacity, and experts estimate that with the application of
new imported equipment made available under the project, capacity utilization will
improve further.

cost estimates, i.e. cost/m3 are comparable with mines of similar nature currently in
production in Coal India. For replacement projects, however, the variable
cost/incremental operating cost are company specific and are based on actual
results of 1995-96. These costs reflect the variable costs per m3 in opencast mines
of Coal India. Interest on working capital is based on historical levels of working
capital requirements equivalent to 4 months operating cash expenses.
Coal production    For mines under construction and expansion mines, the expected increase of coal
output was taken as the major benefit from the subprojects. For projects where
replacement equipment is proposed to be financed, the likely shortfall in coal
output that would occur if equipment was not replaced was taken as the major
benefit. The assessment of the shortfall in production was based on the recent
average annual productivity of each type of equipment in Coal India.

Table 6.2.2: Selection of probability distribution
Variable              Selectedprobability                        Reasonsfor selection
distribution
Coal price                        Normal               The current selling price is the most likely value and any small increase
or decrease above or below the current price is equally likely. In
constant terms the price is more likely to be in the vicinity of its current
value than far away from it.
Project implementation delay      Triangular           In the present analysis, delay has been defined through a factor which
slows down the pace of the year-wise capital investment and as a result,
in extreme case, the coal production program is deferred by one year.
This factor can thus have a minimum, maximum and most likely value.
The values near the minimum and maximum are less likely to occur
than those near the most likely value.
Capital cost                      Custom               This variable cannot be described by any known distribution. There is a
higher probability of completing the project at an investment lower than
the estimated capital cost. This assumption was based on the earlier
experience of Coal India where procurements were made through ICB.
Operating cost                    Normal               At constant prices, the present cash cost of production is the most likely
value, and a small increase or decrease about this mean is equally likely.
Though the overall cost of production in Coal India has been falling in
real teTms for the last three years, it is felt that this downtrend may be
offset by higher costs of working deeper reserves of coal.
Production                        Custom               Because of the uniqueness of each project and different factors affecting
production, this variable could not be defined through any known
distribution. Therefore, a custom distribution was chosen to reflect the
specific nature of the variable. In all cases production lower than the
target was assigned a much higher probability compared to production
above the target.
