PREFACE
This document was prepared by Coal India Ltd. to support its pending application for a
Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project. Environmental and social mitigating actions are an integral
part of the proposed investments. However, in consultation with the World Bank, it has been
decided to formulate a freestanding, IDA-financed environmental and social mnitigation project,
which would precede the investment project. This Sectoral Environmental Assessment covers
both projects.
Preparation of this document extended over a two-year period. The requirements for
resettlement and rehabilitation action are shown as they presented themselves at the time the
Rehabilitation Action Plans were prepared in 1994. These Plans will be updated in the course of
project implementation.
After this document had been prepared, Coal India has informed the Bank that it
plans to finance the investments for the six underground mines, that were originally included in
the project, out of its own resources. The proposed investment project will now support
investments in 25 opencast mines.



INTRODUCTION
Considering the size of its economy, India is poorly endowed with energy
resources. It's major source of commercial energy is coal. Current reserves
are sufficiently large to meet India's demand for coal over the next 250
years. By comparison, oil and gas reserves will last only for another 15-20
years.
By international standards India's per capita consumption of energy is
among the lowest in the world. Food security and even modest improvements in
the standard of living of almost a billion people will increasingly depend on
the availability of relatively inexpensive energy. Unless major technological
breakthroughs alter the options India faces for meeting its rapidly growing
energy demand, the country has little choice but to rely on the development of
its coal reserves. To be sustainable this strategy requires that:
* the Government adopts policies that ensure that energy is used effi-
ciently; and that
* coal producers take whatever steps are required to minimise the
adverse effects of coal mining on the environment and people.
In 1975, ownership and management of almost all Indian coal mines were
transferred to a Government-owned corporation, Coal India Limited (Coal In-
dia). The exceptions were some captive mines belonging to steel plants and a
few mines owned by the Government of Andlra Pradesh. Through its seven subsid-
iary coal companies, Coal India now produces about 90% of India's coal output.
After nationalisation of the coal industry, the Government took full control
of all major management decisions for the coal sector, including coal pricing,
transport and allocation, and the financing of investments. Coal India was
left with a single concern: to attain the coal output targets set by the Gov-
ernment. Soon after nationalisation Coal India recognised that underground
mines, which at that time accounted for over 70% of production, would be un-
able to keep pace with rising demand for coal. To meet this demand, Coal Izdia
adopted a strategy that relied increasingly on opencast mining. This had two
advantages: opencast mining significantly lowered the cost of coal production
and made it possible to increase production quickly. This change of mining
technology led to a rapid expansion of production from about 90 million tonnes
in 1977 to the present rate of over 250 million tonnes.
While the reliance on opencast mining made it possible for Coal India to
meet the increase in coal demand and contain the cost of coal mining, it
brought with it the displacement of large numbers of people and extensive
damage to the environment. The sheer size of opencast mines leads to large-
scale disturbances of the surface topography, build-up of overburden dumps,
generation of fine airbourne dust from blasting and transport of overburden



-2-
and coal, noise from the use of heavy earth moving equipment and degradation
of the surface and ground water regimes due to contamination from waste mate-
rials and hydrological changes from the drawdown of ground water.
Underground mining, though less environmentally damaging, contributes to
the degradation of water quality through the discharge of contaminated mine
water and the disruption of ground water regimes. In addition, underground
mining brings with it smoke pollution, surface caving (from underground
fires), and surface instability and subsidence due to the collapse of mined-
out workings. All of these impacts can be mitigated, and to some extent
avoided all together, through appropriate mine designs and operational prac-
tices.
In response to growing concerns about environmental and social issues in
coal mining areas, the Government of India and State Governments have begun to
establish, over the past two decades, a legal and institutional regime for the
protection of the environment. Like many other industries, the coal industry
faces growing opposition to further expansion in many areas unless it can
demonstrate that it can carry out its operations in an environmentally and
socially sustainable manner. Pull compliance with environmental standards,
fair and comprehensive treatment of local people affected by projects, and the
effective reclamation of lands to a productive or environmentally acceptable
end-use will be the standards by which the industry's performance is measured.
This document was prepared by Coal India to provide the World Bank vith
an overview of the efforts the Indian coal industry and the Government are
undertaking to mitigate the adverse effects of coal mining on the environment
and the people living in mining areas and working in coal mines. Its prepara-
tion was triggered by Coal lndiL Ltd.'s request for a loan from the World Bank
to finance replacement of equipment in existing mines and equipment for com-
pleting the development of mines or for expanding production of exist-
ing mines, as well as the expansion and rehabilitation of mining operations.
This document is based on extensive surveys of the environmental and social
effects of coal mining that were carried out by international consultants,
several Indian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the staff of Coal
India. The findings of these surveys have led to substantial revisions of Coal
India's approach to managing environmental issues and, perhaps most impor-
tantly, its policy for the resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected
by its projects.
This assessment consists of four parts. The first part provides a brief
description of the project; the second part focuses on the environmental ef-
fects of coal mining and their mitigation and the project-specific remedial
actions; the third part deals with the impact of the proposed project on the
people living in mining areas; and the fourth part provides an overview of the
occupational health and safety aspects of the sector and the project.

PART I. SECTORAL AND PROJECT CONTEXT
1.01 This part briefly describes the sectoral backdrop against which the
proposed Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project has been designed. The first sec-
tion deals with the sectoral context. It argues that because of India's size,
its lack of transportation infrastructure and the fact that it has relatively
large coal reserves, coal-based electric power has emerged as the most effi-
cient way to meet India's rapidly growing demand for energy.
Sectoral context
1.02  DoeIza  sMo or coAL. Coal is India's most important source of commerciaLl
energy. It currently meets about two-thirds of India's energy needs. A ccm-
parison of reserves, production and consumption of major commercial energy
resources in India highlights the extent to which coal dominates India's en-
ergy economy. Considering that India's coal reserves are large enough to meet
projected demand for the next 250 years, and the fact that most of these re-
serves can be produced at significantly lower cost than other energy resources
(taking fully into account associated environmental and social cost), coal
will continue to play a dominant role in the years to come. As such, coal will
remain the cornerstone of the Government's strategy for the foreseeable future
unless there is a drastic shift in the relative prices of energy resources.
1.03 This strategy has to be assessed in the context of the medium and long-
term prospects of India's power sector which consumes the bulk of India's coal
production- India's per capita power consumption is among the lowest in the
world. Even with pricing policies that would bring electricity tariffs in line
with the long-term cost of production, the demand for power, and therefore for
coal, will grow rapidly. To meet the growing demand for power and eliminate
the persistent gap between supply and demand, the Government estimates a need
for additional capacity of around 7,000-8,000KW per year.
1.04  DUmUD xm=  cuAomc. To close the gap between power demand and supply,
India will have to develop the full range of energy sources existing in the
country while putting much greater emphasis on efficient pricing, demand side
management (DSM), and increased efficiency in the use of existing generating
transmission and distribution capacity as well as the utilisation of electric
power.
1.05 EmzaK cowswxaTw. The prevailing low energy prices, when combined with the
cost plus pricing mechanisms for many industrial products, provide little
incentive for industry to conserve energy. Studies on India's energy conserva-
tion potential have shown that pricing of power at long run marginal cost
would reduce the need for additional capacity by almost 1,000MW per year. The



-4-
macro-economic reforms undertaken by the Government since 1991 are now gradu-
ally bringing about an environment in which significant DSM activities could
take place. In the expectation that major price reforms will be implemented,
DSM programmes are now being formulated in several States of India with sup-
port from bilateral and multilateral sources (including the World Bank). Over
the medium term, these programmes are estimated to generate energy savings of
about 500MW per annum.
1.06  RiUmmuz wza. The longer term scope for renewable energy development is
estimated at over 20,000MW for wind and 5,000MW for mini-hydros, plus about
75,000MW for larger scale hydros. While some solar PV applications appear
economical in remote areas, it will take a few more years for them to become
economical in grid connected use.
1.07  C=umxoua. It follows from the above that:
* after allowing for both price and non-price DSM measures and after
fullest use of feasible alternative energy programmes, conventional
hydro and thermal power projects will need to contribute some 5,000-
6,000MW of additional capacity per year;
*   the immediate prospect of hydro projects in India is not bright
because of resettlement and rehabilitation problems and other envi-
ronmental issues; in addition,
*   in view of India's limited gas reserves, and until gas import op-
tions have been proven to be technically and economically feasible,
India has little choice but to continue investing in coal-based
power generation.
.08 These conclusions are reinforced in light of India's current level of
development: an estimated 500 million people in India have no access to elec-
tricity service, and a majority of households still rely on fuelvood and dung
for cooking. Although research and development of alternate energy resources
for cooking are in progress, the use of these traditional fuels will continue
to increase in a population growing at about 2% per annum. Unless power gen-
eration and distribution systems improve and increase, this trend will result
in unsustainable pressures on forests, soil and water resources, and add to
the degradation of the general environment that is already too apparent in
many parts of India.
Project context
Origin of the project
1.09 Pzmnr.-ow or sU3Dmmu aunK. Until recently the Government financed between
70% and 90% of Coal India's investments. After the foreign exchange and budget
crisis in 1991, the Government began to phase out its budgetary support for



-5-
Coal India's investments (Fig-
ure 1.1). BecaUse internally       Figure 1.1 The phasing-out of Government
generated resources were in-       financial support to Coal India
sufficient, over the past           Rs billion
three years Coal India's ca-                            Coal India's
pacity to produce coal began                            investmente 
to erode gradually. Increas-           Part of Government
support was usedD
ingly, equipment that has           15  to finan  working
outlived its usefulness can no         capital
longer be replaced; and the
lack of spare parts is forcing
managers to 'cannibalise' part l/
of their equipment. No new
projects have been started.
Without a major injection of         5
financial resources, Coal                               Gon/
India will enter a downward                             support

and diminishing capacity to

Figure 1.2).
1.10  PYuoa   ouuwrnsn. Over the past two years, the Government of India and
Coal India have implemented reforms aimed at making the coal industry commer-
cially viable and financially self-sustaining. The primary objective of the
proposed loan is to support this reform agenda and Coal India's transformation
into a commercial company whose operations are environmentally and socially
sustainable. The transformation, which would encourage, inter alia, reliance
on market forces in the pricing and distribution of coal, closure of uneco-
nomic mines, more extensive use of contractors, opening of the industry to
private investors, phasing out of subsidies to loss-making operations, and
investments in improving operational efficiency as well as coal quality, will
be costly. The proposed loan from the Bank and the cofinancier will allow Coal
India to meet part of these costs. The remainder will come from a projected
increase in internally generated resources (due to efficiency improvements and
the reforms that will be implemented under the programme) and some modest
market borrowings.
1.11 In order for the programme to achieve the desired long-term financial
impact, it would:
*   support investments in opencast and underground mining operations
that are projected to yield the highest economic returns;
*   provide technical assistance in support of the programme; and



*  assist Coal India in miti-    rigue 1.2 2h* iact of the prpoed

mines need additional equipment in          1994 1995 1996 1997 199B 1999 20D0 2001 2002 2003 2004
order to meet an increase in demand;
four mines need both replacement of
equipment and additional equipment;       Coal ndial'. profits

1). Of these 31 projects, 25 are           10
opencast mines and six are under-
ground mines. The loan would also
provide technical assistance for                                 wt       ect

eign exchange requirements are US$1.1 billion. Coal India has requested a
World Bank loan of US$500 million, which would finance part of the required
mining equipment and technical assistance, and an IDA credit of US$50 million,
which would finance environmental and social remedial action programmes. Coal
India has indicated that it would be able to finance about US$800 million of
the estimated cost from internally generated resources and about US$150 mil-
lion from borrowings in local capital markets. The remaining US$500 million is
expected to be raised through cofinancing arrangements.
1.14  Pkxaum umoayz=a. The design of the programme, which involved the iden-
tification of investments (subprojects) yielding the highest economic and
financial rates of return, included agreement with Coal India on (sub)project-
specific implementation arrangements, a review of resettlement and rehabilita-
tion requirements and plans and a review of Environmental Action Plans (EAPs).
This has also provided the Bank with an opportunity to assist Coal India in
strengthening its policies with regard to resettlement and rehabilitation and
the environmental sustainability of its mining operations.
1.15 Coal India has set up a Project Implementation Division (which employs
15 local staff and three fulltime expatriate consultants) at its headquarters
in Calcutta to monitor the implementation of the project, manage the procure-
ment process, the deployment of equipment and the implementation of EAPs and
lehabilitation Actior. Plans (RAPs). In addition, the subsidiary coal companies
are strengthening their capacities - both at their headquarters and the mine
level - to deal with environmental and social issues.
1.16  Pxmu.a swumam==n. As indicated in para. 1.10 above, the proposed
programme would support Coal India's efforts to ensure that its operations are
(a) commercially viable, as well as (b) environmentally and (c) socially sus-
tainable. To ensure Coal India's financial viability beyond the period in
which the programme is being implemented, financial support under the
programme will be provided to mines that yield the highest economic return
while minimising adverse social and environmental impacts. To ensure that Coal
India's operations will be environmentally sustainable, Coal India is in the
process of building capacity in the subsidiary companies and at the mine level
and will follow mine designs and operating practices that meet existing Indisn
environmental standards. To ensure that Coal India's operations will be so-
cially sustainable, Coal India has adopted an enhanced policy for the re-
settlement and rehabilitation of project-affected people (Annex 8). This
policy enlarges the scope of rehabilitation to all project-affected people and
safeguards against losses in their incomes or standards of living. To ensure
proper implementation of this policy, Coal India now has resettlement and
rehabilitation cells at its headquarters and in each subsidiary to implement
and maintain resettlement and rehabilitation and has taken steps to work with
NGOs in identifying self-employment opportunities for project-affected people.

PART II. ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION AND REMEDIAL ACTION
2.01 Part II of this assessment focuses on the effects of coal mining on the
environment (Chapter 1) and the various mitigating and remedial efforts the
Government (Chapter 2) and Coal India (Chapter 3) have adopted to deal with
these effects.
CHAPTER 1 EFFECTS OF COAL MINING ON THE ENVIRONMENT
2.02 Coal mining like many other industrial activities, effects the ambient
environment. Table 2.1 provides an overview of the major effects of coal min-
ing on the physical and biological environments. It is important to keep in
mind that not aUl mining operations generate n1.1 of these effects, and most of
these effects are amenable to mitigation measures.
2.03 Table 2.2 provides a closer view of the underlying causes of the envi-
ronmental effects of coal mining. It also gives an indication of the magnitude
of these effects, the feasible technical solutions and a reference to environ-
mental legislation which addresses these issues.

CHAPTER 2 ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS
2.04 The previous chapter provided an overview of the range of possible ef-
fects of coal mining on the environment. This chapter (Chapter 2) and the
following one (Chapter 3) will present various mitigating actions the Govern-
ment (Chapter 2) abd Coal India (Chapter 3) have taken to minimise the adverse
environmental effects of coal mining.
Legislation
2.05 The United Nation Conference on Human Environment which was held in
Stockholm in June 1972 focused the world's attention on the urgent need for
environmental protection. Table 2.3 provides an overview of legislative mea-
sures India has enacted for the protection of the environment. It shows that
the legislative measures have kept pace with the growing attention the country
places on environmental issues. The following is a summary of India's environ-
mental legislation.

The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
2.06 This Act provides for prevention and control of water pollution. The
objective is to maintain or restore water quality. The Act provides for the
establishment of Pollution Control Boards, both at Central and State levels.
The Boards have the power to give consent for the discharge of pollutants into



- 18 -
the (natural) water system and establish standards for such discharges. The
Act also prescribes penalties for non-compliance.
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1975
2.07 These Rules are the basis for the day-to-day operations of the Pollution
Control Boards including the appointment of members. The Rules also provide
for the setting up of laboratories for analysis of water/effluents.
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977
2.08 This Act is the legal basis for collection of a cess on water consump-
tion by industries and local authorities. The cess finances the day-to-day
operation of the Pollution Control Boards and provides an incentive to elimi-
nate the wasteful use of water.
The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
2.09 Forest land (as all other land) was, prior to this Act, a State 'sub-
ject.' Groving concerns about the rapid decline of forests in India led to the
enactment of this legislation. The Act requires that State Governments must
obtain the approval of the Central Government before they can release forest
land for non-forest purposes. Subsequent modification of this Act in 1980
required that the buyer of the forest land commits himself to the afforesta-
tion of an area twice the size of the forest land he has acquired; and after
mining operations on forest land have been completed, Coal India is required
to afforest the land and return it, without compensation, to the Forest De-
partment.
The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981
2.10 This Act provides the legal basis for the control and abatement of air
pollution, restrictions on emissions, and for penalties in cases of noncompli-
ance with the standards set by the Boards. This Act expands the responsibili-
ties of Central and State Pollution Control Boards to setting standards for
and monitoring of air quality.
The Environmental Protection Act, 1986
2.11 This Act provides the legal basis for environmental protection in areas
not covered by other Acts and for establishment of the Ministry of Environment
and Forests (MOEF). It empowers the MOEF to assume a lead role in long-term
environmental management and short-term response to environmental emergencies.
The Act defines the envirourtent as including 'water, air and land, and the
interrelationship which exists among and between water, air, land, human be-



- 19 '
ings, other living creatures, plants, microorganism and property." The Act
assumes precedence over the previous pollution control Acts by establishing
the power to issue directions "to any person, officer or authority,' and such
authority is bound to comply with such direction 'not withstanding anything
contained in any other law". The power to issue directions includes "the power
to direct the closure, prohibition, or regulation of any industry, operation
or process, or the stoppage or regulation of any industry, operation or pro-
cess, or the stoppage or regulation of the supply of electricity, water or any
other services." The Act provides the Central Government with the power to
undertake "all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the pur-
pose of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and prevent-
ing, controlling, and abating environmental pollution" and to coordinate the
"actions by the State Governments, officers and other authorities." The mea-
sures assumed by the Central Government under this Act now include nationwide
waste management planning; establishing objectives for the quality of the
environment "in its various aspects;" establishing standards for all sources
of pollution emissions and discharges; designation of areas where certain
types of industries may not operate or may not operate, or may operate only
under specified restrictions; development of environmental emergency response
and contingency planning procedures; hazardous substance regulations; environ-
mental protection and waste management research; inspections of water generat-
ing facilities and the issuance of pollution prevention, control and abatement
orders; establishment or 'recognition" of environmental laboratories; and the
preparation of environmental management manuals, codes and guidelines.
Regulations
2.12 Pursuant to these Acts, the Government issues notifications from time to
time to ensure compliance with the legal provisions. The more important ones
are summarised below.
Ambient objectives for air and drinking water quality and noise level
2.13 Ambient environmental management objectives are set to protect public
health and sensitive natural resources such as fisheries, vegetation and soil
productivity. Ambient or 'receiving' environmental objectives are the basis
for assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of point-source discharges
or emissions, which are usually regulated by permits or consent letters, and
non-point or dispersed pollution sources which are not usually amenable to
direct regulation. Coal mining is a non-point source of air pollution and is
therefore guided by ambient objectives or standards.
2.14 Ambient objectives have been established for air quality, noise level
and drinking water quality. Tables 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 show the standards for air
quality, noise level and drinking water quality. These objectives are gener-

ally consistent with standards elsewhere in the world under similar conditions
and, are adequate to protect public health and the environment.

2.15 Recent concerns about the possible effects of nitrates in drinking water
on the unborn fetus have prompted some jurisdictions to reduce acceptable
nitrate levels to the 10 to 20mg/1 range. This parameter is of relevance to
mining operations because of the possibility of nitrates from uncombusted
explosives leaching to surface and ground water from overburden dumps. How-
ever, water samples of leachate from dumps of a large number of mines show
that the nitrate content of these samples varies from 12 to 15mg/i compared to
the tolerance standard of 45mg/l.

2.16 Nozsz. The noise level limits prescribed (Table 2.3) are generally in
line with the international standards. monitoring of noise levels at and
around mining operations indicates that they are well below threshold limits.
2.17 Discharge and emission standards usually apply to point sources of pol-
lution, for example the typical 'stacks and pipes' discharges. Most of the air
quality problems at minesites come from 'mobile' and 'dispersed' sources of
pollution, that is from 'line and area' sources instead of point sources of
emission. Pollution levels must be managed, therefore, through the use of
'ambient objectives.' Waste water discharge standards, established under
Schedule II of the Environment (Protection) Rules 1986 and subsequent Gazette
Notice No. GSR 422(E) of 19 May 1993, apply to the discharge from mines, other
infrastructural areas and from domestic sewage treatment systems. Discharge
standards for effluents from coal mines are shown in Table 2.8. These stan-
dards are consistent with those used in similar conditions in other countries.
The State Pollution Control Boards, while applying these standards for giving
consent to discharge, take account of the assimilative capacity of receiving
waters. Where quality of discharges is not meeting the standards, the effluent
has to be treated before being discharged.

Standards for disturbed land reclamation
2.18 Although coal mining, in particular opencast mining, alters the struc-
ture and appearance of the land considerably, no statutory standards for con-
taining these land disturbances exist. Similarly, there are no standards for
land reclamation. However, in recent years the !OEF has made the clearance of
coal projects conditional on a commitrient from coal companies to reclaim
mined-out areas so that the land can be used for the same purposes as before
mining started. To facilitate this, the MOBF is limiting the slopes of over-



- 23 -
burden dumps to an angle of 280 or less. (The decision to constrain the slopes
of overburden dumps to 280 or less was taken to facilitate land reclamation
and has no bearing on the safety of overburden dumps.)
Institutional arrangements
2.19 The following agencies of the Central and State governments deal with
environmental issues (Figure 2.1):
* The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF)
* The MOEF's regional offices
* The HOEF's State offices
* Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
* State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs)
*   Regional Offices of the SPCBs
*   Regional Planning Authorities
The Ministry of Environment and Forests
2.20 The MOEF is primarily responsible for environmental planning at the
national level; drafting of environmentaL objectives, standards and codes of
practices; as well as reviews/approvals of Environmental Management Plans
(EMPs), impact assessments and the issuing of environmental clearances.
The WOEF's regional offices
2.21 The MOEF's regional offices have two major functions: to conduct site
visits to projects that have applied for an environmental clearance and to
monitor compliance with environmental standards and the conditions of consent
letters.
The HOEF's State offices
-2.22 At the State level, the Department of Environment is primarily respon-
sible for administering the environmental assessment and clearance process for
projects under State jurisdiction, for advising the MOEF on the assessment for
these projects under its jurisdiction, and for undertaking compliance audits
of environmental clearances. In parallel, the Department of Forests at the
State level identifies land for compensatory afforestation; advises the MOEF
on the use of forest land for coal mining and organises the applications for
forest conversion; and undertakes revegetation and replanting of mined-out
areas (including disturbed lands) with funds provided by the coal companies.

Central Pollution Control Board
2.23 The Central Pollution Control Board advises the MOEF on pollution mat-
ters, including environmental standards: provides guidance and technical as-
sistance to State Pollution Control Boards; carries out national research
programs on pollution problems and abatement technologies; collects and pub-
lishes national statistics on pollution; and prepares manuals, codes and
guidelines relating to the prevention, control or abatement of pollution.
State Pollution Control Boards
2.24 State Pollution Control Boards advise the Department of Environment at
the State level on pollution matters; they issue consent letters and collect
fees for all discharges and emissions; monitor waste-generating facilities for
compliance with the conditions set on in the consent letters; and, where nec-
essary, issue orders for the prevention, control or abatement of pollution.
Regional offices of State Pollution Control Boards
2.25 The main function of the Regional SPCBs is to carry out site inspections
of the industries in the region. They also process applications for approval
of discharges of that would result in water or air pollution.
Regibnal planning authorities
2.26 Coal mining and pithead power generation has transformed several
coalfields into major sources of commericial energy which have attracted nu-
merous (frequently energy-intensive) industries. To coordinate the development
of these regions and to better manage the (combined) impact of these indus-
tries on the environment and social fabric of the region, Central and State
governments have established Special Area Development Authorities (SADAs) in
the Singrauli, Korba, Talcher, Jharia and Raniguni coalfields. SADAs focus in
particular on environmental and social issues that cannot be addressed effec-
tively by companies or organisations individually. These include monitoring of
regional water and air quality; management of regional environmental mitiga-
tion measures, such as pollution abatement programmes; development of invento-
ries ('regional banks') of non-forest and degraded land that could be affor-
ested for compensatory purposes; and regional resettlement plans that would
prevent people from having to resettle more than once due to lack of coordina-
tion of project implementing agencies. To achieve these objectives. SADAs seek
representation from all major industries and agencies operating in a region.
They usually include the Central and State government agencies, Coal India,
power utilities, Indian Railways, other public and private industries, as well
as local NGOs.

Zn xVlxom"tal Panag.meat Plans (lMPs)
2.27 Since 1981-82, the Central Government involved the Department of Envi-
ronment in investment decisions for coal projects. This was the first step
towards taking environmental concerns fully into account at the planning stage
of new projects. Since 1986. the Government requires submission of EMPs for
investments in new coal mines or an increase of coal production from existing
mines. (Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are an intergral part of the
EMPs. The MOEF bases its decision on a single document, the EtPa.
Preparation of EMPs
2.28 According to regulations issued by the Government for the preparation of
EIAs and EMPs, the agency proposing to implement a coal project is required to
submit an application to the Secretary of the MOEF for an environmental clear-
ance and, if the acquisition of forest land is involved, for a forest clear-
ance. The application needs to include the project report as well as the EMP
for the proposed project. The MOEF will then review the EMP. In doing so, they
will usually seek the assistance of specialised advisory committees (Environ-
mental Appraisal Committees [EACs]). In their review of project proposals,
EACs usually include NGOs. The MOEF, at the advice of the EACs, can call for
hearings on proposed projects with project-affected people, if they believe
that this would be in the public interest. (Hearings are usually held if there
is large-scale resettlement involved or if there are likely to be significant
environmental impacts.) Project-affected people and their (elected) represen-
tatives can convey their views or objections to the MOEF before a clearance
letter is issued. If considered necessary, the EAC visits the project site.
After the EAC is fully satisfied with the EIA and the mitigation measures in
the EMP, the MOEF issues a clearance letter for the project with stipulations
that would ensure the implementation of the required mitigation measures.
2.29 The present EMPs cover almost all environmental aspects. They usually
include:
* a description of the geology and mining technology of the project;
* a description of the present (pre-mining) environmental conditions;
* an assessment of the environmental impact of the proposed project,
in particular how the project would change the pre-mining environ-
ment;
*  a detailed description of measures to minimise noise and air and
water pollution;
* the preparation of mining and detailed reclamation plans for each
period of five years of operation;
*  the preparation of final land use plans covering different viable
land uses;
*  a proposal for biological reclamation;



- 27 -
*   a description of the organisation for implementation and monitoring
of the environmental protection measures; and
* the financial estimates covering the capital and revenue expendi-
ture.
2.30 Coal India's EMPs cover most of the subjects required by OD 4.01. Areas
not dealt with in the EMPs, such as environmental policy, environmental law,
institutional arrangements, occupational health and safety, and public consul-
tation, have been addressed in this report.
Consultations
2.31 Consultations with project-affected people and NGOs take place before
the clearance letter is issued (as indicated above), dur±n project implemen-
tation gMd in the course of mine operations.
2.32  Damim wAo=  mwzmmzoin. If there are any environmental issues affecting
the people living nearby during the implementation of the mining project, Coal
India discusses these issues with the people and takes steps to alleviate them
as soon as possible. For example, if wells dry up, Coal India supplies potable
water. If houses or other structures are damaged due to vibrations from blast-
ing, Coal India repairs them. Whenever people in mining areas have concerns
about the impact of mining operations on their health, safety or welfare, they
convey them to respective mine managers. As such, mine managers are involved
in an ongoing process of consultation with project-affected people on environ-
mental issues and appropriate actions are taken based on these discussions.
Coal India has agreed to keep records of these discussions and any actions
taken.
Dissemination
2.33 Coal India is in the process of making all project-related documentation
(project descriptions, EMPs, the MOEF approvals, consent letters, letters of
noncompliance pointed out by regulatory bodies, and the EAPs) available to the
public at Coal India's headquarters in Calcutta and at the headquarters of
subsidiary coal companies. Notices to this effect will be put up at the of-
fices of the subsidiary company headquarters and the project sites. General
Managers (Environment) at all corporate offices have been instructed to handle
any inquiries and follow up any questions from concerned parties, including
NGOs.
Ehforcement
2.34 Rz,ouRc xzxm=mar. To enforce compliance with environmental laws and the
conditions contained in the clearance letter, all project managers are re-



- 28 -
quired to submit quarterly reports on air and water quality and noise levels
in their jurisdiction; semi-annual reports of the status of EMP implementation
are sent to the MOEF for all environmentally cleared projects; and all coal
mines have to submit annual environmental statements to the respective State
Pollution Control Board.
2.35 In addition, representatives of the regional offices of State Pollution
Control Boards and the MOEF monitor compliance through site visits. The main
concern of the State Pollution Control Boards is pollution due to the dis-
charge of effluents. In their infrequent visits of mining operations, they
focus primarily on effluents from coal washeries. At the end of their site
visits, they make mostly verbal comments. As of now, Coal India and its sub-
sidiary companies have not received any written comments from the
reresentatives of (regional) State Pollution Control Boards. The representa-
tives of the regional offices of the NOEF focus on (a) the effluents from coal
washeries and (b) on applications for forestry clearances. MOEF personnel
visits mine sites only sporadically. The lack of regular inspections seems to
be largely due to a shortage of inspectors.
_HAPTER 3 COAL 3NDIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
Objectiven
2.36 Coal India is committed to comply with all environmental laws, regula-
tions and the conditions contained in letters of clearance by the MOEF. In
addition, Coal India's corporate environmental policy aims at;
a. full integration of EMPs and environmental impact management with
mine planning and design to facilitate the attainment of environmen-
tal standards, laws and regulations; and
b. mitigation, to the maximum extent possible, of the environmental and
social impacts of mining.
Strategy
2.37 To achieve these objectives, Coal India has adopted the following strat-
egy:
*   Coal India is in the process of changing its designs for coal mines.
In the future, Coaal India will follow designs that not only meet
environmental standards, but minimise adverse effecrs on the ambient
environment and the people living in the surrounding area.
*   On new mines, environmental management will be fully integrated with
mine design, planning and development; comprehensive baseline sur-



-29-
veys will serve as the basis for EIAs and the planning of reclama-
tion activities.
*   Reclamation of 'mined-out' areas will aim at achieving post-mining
conditions that vili help local people sustain or improve their
livelihood. Reclamation activities will be carried out in such a way
as to minimise delays between mining activities and post-mining use.
In carrying out these activities, Coal India will develop and adopt
reclamation technologies that are best suited for the Indian eco-
logical conditions.
*   Coal India will work closely with State Governments in identifying
an inventory of deforested land that can be used for compensatory
afforestation.
*   In the-years ahead, Coal India will give priority to the protection
of air and water quality, the abatement of noise and the strengthen-
ing of its capability to reclaim mined-out areas.
Mitigating environmental management programmes
Mine planning and design
2.38 Coal India is now fully integrating environmental management consider-
ations into the design and planning of new mines and the expansion of existing
mines. Coal India is in the process of reviewing its current approach to the
design and planning with a view to minimise adverse effects on the environment
and to facilitate land reclamation after the completion of mining activities.
2.39 In addition, Coal India will add 'rolling' five year operational plans
for all mine-related environmental activities to the EMPs for new mines. These
plans will be updated annually as long as a mine is in operation.
Environmental nonitoring
2.40 Coal India believes that it is the company's responsibility to police
the compliance with environmental rules and regulations. With the growing
concern about environmental issues, environmental monitoring has taken on a
significance that is well beyond Coal India's current capabilities. To
strengthen Coal India's capabilities in this area is an important element of
Coal India's Corporate Environmental Action Plan (Annex 5).
2.41 Coal India has decided that for environmental monitoring, the regional
environmental cells of the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI)
will be responsible for overall supervision and guidance. Technically accept-
able monitoring programmes will be in place on all subprojects by the begin-
ning of the pre-monsoon period 1996. Environmental laboratories are being set
up in the subsidiary companies and at CNPDI. CMPDI laboratories currently



- 30 -
cover the subprojects of CCL, NCL and the SECL subprojects in gorba coalfield.
Until the other laboratories are completed, agencies approved by MOEF are
engaged to carry out the environmental monitoring of the subprojects of MCL,
WCL and those of SECL not in Korba coalfield.
Air quality management
2.42 The monitoring of the air quality at Coal India's mines indicates that
gaseous pollutants are generally within standard limits. However, monitoring
of suspended particulate matter (SPM) shows that this aspect of environmental
management needs concerted mitigating efforts. Monitoring records and analyses
indicate that 54% of mines meet the industrial SPM standard of 500Lg/m3. The
remaining mines exceed the limit, especially in pre-monsoon months which is
the most dry and dusty period of the year. Material handling and transport,
especially on haul and transport roads, generates large quantities of fugitive
dust. Many of the known control/remedial measures for fugitive dust, during
its generation and dispersion, are in place in the coal projects. These are
metaling/paving of permanent roads, regular water spraying of roads, provision
of bag filters in drills, blasting restriction during high winds and water
spraying at other dust generating points. Newer mines have enclosed coal han-
dling plants and auto water sprinklers at coal transfer and loading points. In
addition, most mines have planted trees along the sides of roads, around in-
frastructure facilities and around residential areas.
2.43 Air quality monitoring at townships or colonies indicates that only 44%
of the areas are in compliance with the rural/residential standard of 200pg/
m3. Over half (56%) recorded values during the pre-monsoon period are in ex-
cess of the environmental standards. However, many of the colonies come under
the project leasehold and environmental clearance permits the level of SPM up
to 500pg/m3 in the leasehold area. The high SPM in colony area can only be
partly attributed to mining activities. Fly ash from power plants, dust from
poorly maintained local roads, the burning of domestic fuel wood, wind erosion
from bare areas, and emission from other industrial activities such as cement
and chemical plantscontribute to high SPM levels. Coal India has decided to
analyse the existing air monitoring data for colony areas in order to deter-
mine the most problematic areas.
2.44 NMzc&=G msaUs. Air quality monitoring will be undertaken in all vil-
la;es currently situated within core zones and on the fringe of buffer zones
to determine compliance with the environmental standards for suspended par-
ticulate matter (SPM). All necessary measures, including watering of haul
roads, fine mist spraying at transfer points and quick regreening of overbur-
den dumps, will be taken to reduce dust to acceptable levels. Existing air
monitoring information for all colonies will be analysed to determine problem



- 31 -
areas, and remedial air quality management plans will be prepared for all of
these areas.
Noise management
2.45 Recorded noise levels on the mine sites are quite moderate. A few
projects have recorded a day time noise levels above the 75 dB(A) level but in
most cases the noise level in the mines and colony areas are within these
limits.
Hydrology and water quality management
2.46 Mining needs continuous pumping of water out of the workings. In the
past, Coal India has not prepared water balance studies. However, a recent EIA
notification (27-1-94) makes water balance studies for proposed coal projects
mandatory. Nitrates levels in effluents are well within the MOEF standards.
Nitrate levels in leachate from some dumps show a concentration of only 12 to
15mg/i. Regarding sewage treatment, a common practice in colonies is to have
soak pits for individual houses or a block of houses and there is no need to
have separate treatment facilities. However, Coal India will monitor the
ground water in its colonies to ensure that the soak pits do not contaminate
the ground water regime. The water quality from mines meets the standards
except with regard to total suspended solids (TSS) and oil and grease dis-
charge. The thrust for dealing with water quality is based on the use of set-
tling ponds and lagoons to allow some sedimentation time before the clarified
water is discharged into local water courses. Coal India will ensure that oil
and grease traps are provided, especially for effluents from workshops,
washeries, and coal handling plants.
2.47 KMa.s3cs mrumus. Surface water control and treatment schemes, including
collection drains, adequately-sized settling ponds and polishing ponds before
final discharge will be implemented at all subprojects by December 1996. There
will be no further discharge of untreated industrial effluent directly to the
environment after June 1996. Monitoring and soil suitability studies will be
undertaken in colony areas to determine the acceptability of septic field
sewage disposal and, where needed, sewage treatment facilities will be pro-
vided. Prograrmes for strengthening and/or constructing drains and settling
tanks are provided in the EAP for each subproject. An assessment of the quan-
tity of water to be discharged from each mine is required to obtain consent
from the State Pollution Control Board for the discharge of effluents. Mines
will ensure that effluents meet Indian environmental standards before dis-
charge.



- 32 -
2.48 The impact of mining on local groundwater supplies will be assessed once
every quarter through monitoring of water levels and quality in local wells.
Where domestic wells are adversely affected, Coal India will provide alternate
sources of potable water.
Disturbed land reclamation
2.49 It is Coal India's policy to afforest mined-out areas. The refractory
soil conditions of external and internal dumps make it extremely ;ifficult to
reclaim mined-out areas for agricultural purposes. In the course of time, as
rocks degrade and the soil becomes mo-z fertile, the dumps can accept some
plantation. The reclamation cf these spoils for agricultural purposes would be
extremely costly. According to Coal India, afforestation of mined-out areas
and overburden dumps is a desirable activity to mitigate the declining forest
cover in rural areas. Furthermore, if the pre-mining land use was mostly mar-
ginal faruing with low yields, then any attempt to restore the land to full-
fledged agriculture may not be economic.
2.50 The top soil conservation and its reuse is a commonly suggested proposal
in EMPs. However, it has yet to be established whether the top one meter of
soil is good or the one meter soil lying below it is better. In tropical cli-
mates the lower soil may have more nutrients due to heavy monsoons and
leachate. Coal India will carry out a study to determine the quality of top
soils before finalising its reclamation strategy.
2.51 One of the standard conditions in recent envirormental clearances is to
keep the slope angle of overburden dumps to 28° or less. This slope is consid-
ered a general guideline that will permit ez.cly establishment of self-sustain-
ing vegetation cover. In light of this requirement, slopes of future overbur-
den dumps are planned to be kept below 280. As far as existing overburden
dumps are concerned, Coal India will appoint a panel of experts which will
review the safety of these dumps by June 30, 1996. (Coal India will submit the
terms of reference for this panel to the Bank before appraisal.) If the panel,
which would consist of international and T-dian experts, finds that an over-
burden dump is unsafe, it will suggest remedial measures. Coal India will
immediately proceed with the implementation of these measures. This panel of
experts will also review the various options for the reclamation of existing
overburden dumps (Annex 4). Based on these reviews, the panel will submit to
Coal India proposals for reclamation of these dumps. Coal India will closely
interact with local authorities and local people to establish end use objec-
tives for each minesite. Native species will be used wherever possible in
reclamation programmes. For new dump areas studies will be carried out to
determine the most cost effective combination of initial spoil placement and
subsequent recontourirg to achieve the desired spoil configuration. A common



f
- 33 -
pool of earth-moving equipment for the exclusive use of reclanation will be
placed under the control of area environmental cells. Significant horizons of
organic soil will be conserved for use in plant propagation facilities or in
reclamation. Spoil placement will be carried out to ensure that the most suit-
able materials for plant growth are placed on the dump surface.
2.52 Biological reclamation on many mine sites has been carried out by the
State Forest Department or associated State Forest Research Institutes. The
species most commonly used in reclamation planting are shown in Annex 3 and
these have almost invariably been planted in block monocultures. Some excel-
lent survival and growth rate has been achieved. However, while the selection
of tree species has been appropriate (with the possible exception of Eucalyp-
tus species which seem to suppress the establishment of self-seeding ground
plants), the monoculture plantings and the use of trees to the exclusion of
other plant groups is not. The main objectives of disturbed land reclamation
are to stabilise the soil, to begin the process of soil rebuilding and enrich-
ment, and to re-establish a productive land use. These objectives are most
likely to be achieved through the establishment of mixed communities of trees,
shrubs, grasses and forbs. Trees alone are unable to stabilise the surface
soil since they lack the fibrous root systems and ground cover like grasses,
legumes and many shrubs. Nitrogen fixation, an important consideration in
reclamation, is much more efficient in herbaceous and shrubby legumes.
Grasses, herbaceous legumes and shrubs can provide valuable livestock forage,
and many shrubs because of their resprouting ability can provide continuous
supply of domestic firewood. Relatively few trees have this "coppicing' abil-
ity. Annex 3 contains recommendations on shrub species suitable for reclama-
tion planting in central India. Some project staff are beginning to experiment
with grass and legumes on a project-by-project basis. Grass species such as
vetiver (Vetiveria zizanoides), red oat (Avena byzantina). Seymour grass
(Bothriochlo-apertusa), foxtail (Cenchrus biflorus and C.cilaris), and zinzvo
(Dichanthium annulatum) have been used to reclaim degraded pasture land and
may prove useful for mine reclamation as well. It is therefore decided that
company and area environmental cells will consult the State Department of
Agriculture and local university agricultural faculties to determine the most
suitable grass and legume species and seed sources for each location. Success-
ful establishment of grasses and legumes usually entails sacrification of the
surface to cover the seed. Seed sown onto unsacrified overburden material
often washes off, particularly if the surface is compacted. The use of conven-
tional agricultural equipment is constrained by uneven and rocky ground. To                i
overcome this, different types of heavy harrows are proposed to be tried.
Subsidence
2.53 Surface subsidence due to the collapse of underground workings
continuess to be a major problem in many older underground coal mines. Many of



- 34 -
these mines were started before nationalisation. They are quite shallow and
their former owners had little experience with the size of pillars necessary
to prevent gallery collapse. Most of the present mines are much deeper, knowl-
edge of pillar size is much more reliable, and many mines now practice gallery
backfilling. For these reasons, subsidence in modern mines is expected to be
relatively small, and easily mitigable by filling up the cracks appe_ring at
the surface and some recontouring. All land subject where subsidence has oc-
curred is acquired by the coal companies and is not made available for post-
mining use until fully stabilised. Meanwhile some vegetation is grown over
such land to stop entry of air and water and to help improve the ecology.
Regional land and environmental management planning
2.54 The rapid expansion of industrial activity, in areas such as the
Singrauli, Talcher, Wardha Valley and Korba coalfields, has resulted in a
complex interaction of economic, environmental and social impacts that can no
longer be be managed solely on a project-by-project basis. Land use zoning is
being established to minimise inter-sectoral conflict and provide each sector
with the land base necessary to implement its programs. Regional environmental
and social monitoring networks are being established, linked to monitoring
activities of individual projects and companies. Programs of environmental and
social impact management are being coordinated where possible, in order to
avoid duplication and the potential of working at cross purposes. This re-
gional approach to development planning is posing a substantial challenge to
the abilities of the State government agencies and local industries to work
jointly towards a common objective. Coal India is actively participating in
the implementation of regional environmental management plans coordinated by
various Regional Area Development Authorities.
Coal quality and ash management
2.55 The ash content of Indian coal used for power generation ranges from 30%
to 50%. Ash disposal has become a major problem for power stations. Most of
the ash in run-of-mine (RON) coal in India originates from mineral matter
interbedded with carbonaceous material at the time of formation of coal. How-
ever, some mineral contamination also takes place from roof and floor stones
and various thin dirt bands lying within the coal bed, during the mechanised
mining process.
2.56  nmsaDL Ac==. Coal India recognises the increasing problem of fly ash
disposal in the country and is cooperating with pit head power generation
companies in identifying ash management options, in particular ash disposal in
abandoned opencast or underground mines. Coal India proposes the following
actions to assist the power utilities in their ash management:
removal of extraneous mineral matters at the pit head and

*  beneficiation of ROM coal for power plants located farther than
750km from the mine, if they are prepared to bear the cost; in addi-
tion
*  Coa. India will assist pithead power plants in a study of the feasi-
bil:ty of ash disposal in mined-out areas.
Organimational structure for enviromental management
2.57 The primary responsibility for implementation of Coal India's corporate
environmental policy will remain with Coal India headquarters in Calcutta,
coal producing subsidiaries and CMPDI. In order to be able to address environ-
mental issues more effectively, CMPDI, which provides expert services for mine
planning and design, environment and research, established in January 1993 an
Institute of Environment (IOE) at its head office at Ranchi and regional envi-
ronmental cells at its regional offices. To safeguard the effective implemen-
tation of its environmental policy, Coal India will carry out, as part of the
proposed program, a review of its capacity to deal effectively with environ-
mental issues. This review will focus in particular on the need for changes in
the organisational structure, the skills and staffing requirements. Annex 5
describes in somewhat more detail Coal India's corporate environmental strat-
egy and action plan and includes a flowchart of the organisational structure
currently in place to deal with environmental and mine safety issues.
Staff development and training
2.58 To overcome the shortage of trained environmental staff, Coal India will
train available staff and recruit new staff when specific skills are not in-
ternally available. Coal India is planning to develop practical training
programmes for existing and inducted staff and new recruits with specially
designed curricula at local universities. The training programmes will include
environmental impact appreciation for senior management, effluent treatmen:
schemes for engineers, dump stability and reclamation techniques, and inspec-
tion and monitoring scheduling. A detailed raining program will be developed
in the context of the review of Coal India's environmental capacity. Coal
India is currently in the process of select-...g executive and non-executive
staff for environmental positions throughout the companies. Executives will
undergo training at the Centre of Mining Environment at the Indian School of
Mines. In addition, training on environmental requirements and the implementa-
tion of environmental measures is being provided to all mine managers.
2.59 Coal India subscribes to the principle that good environmental manage-
ment is the responsibility of everyone - equipment operators, production
staff. environmental personnel and senior management.



- 36 -
2.60 In addition, Coal India proposes to establish annual awards to its em-
ployees for excellence in environmental programmes, paralleling the award
programmes for production and worker safety.
2.61 In line with the corporate environmental policy outlined above, in par-
ticular the commitment to self-police compliance with environmental laws and
regulations, Coal In'lia has reviewed the status of environmental compliance of
the mines proposed to receive financial support under the programme. The re-
view showed that, in spite of adequate planning, the implementation of EmPs is
not as effective as it should be. There are still areas of environmental non-
compliance and many of the environmental mitigation measures called for in
EMPs have yet to be implemented. A programme of action (EAPs), which would
bring all mines into full compliance with required environmental standards is
attached as Annex 6. Coal India is committed to full compliance with environ-
mental standards, EMPs, letters of consent and EAPs for all 31 subprojects by
December 1997. In addition, all surface areas subject to mining disturbances
will be stabilised and reclaimed by December 2000. In order to ensure that
this schedule is achieved, Coal India has prepared multi-year EAPs for each
subproject with benchmarks and budgets. Box 2.1 contains a brief description
of the basic structure and information provided in the EAPs. Each of the EAPs
contains a time-bound action programme for environmental mitigation which
clearly identifies benchmarks to facilitate monitoring of the implementation
of these plans.
Consultations
2.62 Coal India is consulting project-affected people, their representatives
and NGOs about the remedial and mitigating actions it plans to take in the
context of implementing the Environmental Action Plans. These consultations
are held at the offices of mine managers on mine-specific issues, and at Coal
India headquarters on environmental and social policy issues that cover the
majority of Coal India's mining operations. Annex 7 provides an example of the
concerns raised at consultative meetings.

PART III. SOCIAL ISSUES
3.01  Because coal mining and associated power developments have generally
been sited in remote rural areas, the period of rapid expansion has also
brought about some fundamental changes, both positive and negative, to the
lifestyles of local people, many of whom have lived at subsistence level, are
poorly educated, and are from traditional cultures. Resettlement projects fall
generally into two categories; voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary resettle-
ment usually involves younger people - natural risk-takers seeking new oppor-
tunities who have made the decision to move on their own. By contrast, invol-
untary resettlement usually expropriates the rights cf people who may not want
to move, and involves whole communities of individuals who had previously
lived in interdependence: young and old, healthy and sick, affluent and poor,
landholders and landless, skilled and unskilled. Since compensation has usu-
ally been tied to loss of land rather than loss of livelihood, displacement
divides the community. often, with the break-up of the community, the
wealthier and more highly-skilled move to pursue opportunities elsewhere,
leaving behind a disproportionately poorer community with limited ability to
adapt to changing circumstances. In addition, increasing industrial activity
typically attracts immigrants. Disadvantaged local people often either end up
as exploited contract labourers trapped in perpetual poverty or they simply
leave the area, to reappear in the slums of the city or as squatters, en-
croaching on unoccupied lands (often forest areas) in other parts of the re-
gion. The intrusion of industrial activity into traditional, rural coummunities
and the resulting adverse social impacts occur in nearly every country and nc
country has yet dealt with them well. Therefore, there are no successful mod-
els of displacement and resettlement that can guide the coal industry and the
thermal power sector in their local rehabilitation programs.
3.02 Judging from the experience in industrial countries and other Asian
countries, economic growth will intensify the demand for energy in India.
Currently, much of the energy that is produced in India is used inefficiently.
Appropriate pricing policies and other incentives would undoubtedly reduce the
use of energy by many end users. While efficient energy use will definitely
reduce the demand for energy per unit of output, it will not alleviate the
need for more energy to produce additional units of output. As the standard of
living of India's growing population rises, so does the demand for energy, in
particular electricity. A comparison with energy use in industrial countries
clearly demonstrates this.
3.03 At least in the foreseeable future, this additional energy will have to
come mostly from coal-based thermal power generation. Therefore, efficient and
environmentally sustainable coal production is essential if India wants to



- 39
reap the benefits of its liberalisation program, accelerate economic growth
and continue to make headway in its efforts to alleviate poverty.
3.04 Coal production, whether it takes places in underground or opencast
mines, requires access to land. Unlike other industries, the coal industry has
little choice in the location of its activities because coal mines have to be
developed where there are commercial reserves. In recent years, the social and
environmental costs of developing coal resources have increased considerably,
particularly in the densely populated areas of India's eastern States. Coal
India finds it increasingly difficult to acquire land for the expansion of its
operations. To deal with these challenges Coal India has changed the designs
of new mines to minimise the adverse effects of these operations on the envi-
ronment; it has adopted resettlement and rehabilitation policies that ensure
that all people affected by its projects are compensated for their losses; it
has intensified the community development programmes through which it aims to
improve the living conditions in villages adjacent to its mining operations;
and it is strengthening the organisational structure within the coal companies
to ensure effective implementation of these policies.
3.05 This section provides an overview of the magnitude and issues involved
in the acquisition of land by the coal industry, in particular the impact on
the people affected by it. It gives a synopsis of the two main legal instru-
ments for land acquisition by the coal industry (the Land Acquisition Act
(1904) and the Coal Bearing Areas Act (1957)), as well as Coal India's poli-
cies for resettlement and rehabilitation. This will be followed by a summary
of the main issues the coal industry faces in implementing the legal and
policy provisions, and the options its needs to consider to deal with them.
Against this background, this section will then describe the social impact of
the proposed programme, and the arrangements that have been made to ensure
that resettlement and rehabilitation programmes associated with the programme
meet the Bank's operational Directives.
Need for land
3.06 Sum twomans orCTAn an=c. With the shift towards opencast operations the
need for land has increased dramatically. At the time of nationalisation, only
a third of India's coal production came from opencast mines. Over the past two
decades this share has almost doubled. As a result, the coal industry needs to
acquire large tracts of land year after year. Table 3.1 shows the cumulative
effect of the shift towards opencast mining on land requirements and people
affected by coal projects.
3.07 Behind the shift towards opencast mining are mainly economic consider-
ations. Opencast operations require relatively little labor; permit deployment
of cost effective, highly mechanised operations; have a short gestation pe-

riod, and as such allow the industry to accelerate production over a short
time span; and are considerably safer than underground mines. On the other
hand, they require the acquisition of large tracts of land and the resettle-
ment and rehabilitation of large numbers of people, they result in widespread
environmental degradation, and are the primary cause for the gradual decline
of the average quality of coal output. Coal can only be mined through opencast
mines if the coal deposits are close to the surface; the maximum depth of
opencast coal mines is about 250m.
3.08 Deeper deposits have to be extracted through underground mining. These
mines face many of the same social and environmental consequences as opencast
mines: while land requirements are usually smaller, subsidence (due to the
routine collapse of mined out areas) damages houses and infrastructure and
impairs the use of land above underground mines, and effluents from under-
ground mines are a major source of water pollution. From a commercial perspec-
tive, they are more costly to operate because they are more difficult to
mechanise and require considerably more labor than opencast mines. Although
they produce higher quality coal, most underground mines in India suffer heavy
financial losses.
3.09 In recent years Coal India has faced growing pressure to safeguard the
environment and welfare of the people affected by its operations. While this
has added to the cost of mining and reduced the cost advantage opencast mining
enjoyed, without these measures the coal industry would not be able to sustain
its further growth.

Social implications
3.10 The development of coal mines has a wide range of effects on the local
population. While some welcome the opportunities and changes that are part of
mine development, others resist them. Among these changes are:
Eunv"ro    ow,zuwrzom. The opening of a coal mine brings employment into
an area. The relatively high wages of the coal industry (Rs45,000 a
year, equivalent to US$1,331) are far above the prevailing minimum
wage (Rs6,600 a year, equivalent to US$195) and make employment at
the mine highly attractive. In almost all instances it remains tale
key to land acquisition and is the primary form of rehabilitation
for landowners. This makes it virtually impossible for the coal
industry to transfer surplus labor from other mines; not only would
the local population resist, it would rob the coal company of its
most valuable bargaining chip in its efforts to acquire the neces-
sary land. Construction activities at the mine, and the increase in
purchasing power of those that have found employment with the coal
company, create numerous indirect employment opportunities.
HusALi cuaz. Employees of the coal company enjoy some of the best
health care available in India. In emergencies, coal companies make
their facilities available to local people not employed by them. In
addition, coal companies construct 'dispensaries' at resettlement
sites, as part of the rehabilitation package to project-affected
people. (State Governments are to provide the necessary staff, how-
ever, in practice, States frequently fail to do this.) As part of
its community development program, coal companies frequently con-
struct dispensaries and clinics in the surrounding villages, even if
they are not directly affected by their operations.

colonies, schools are also provided as part of the rehabilitation
package to project-affected people. However, State Governments are
responsible for providing teachers, which they frequently fail to
do.

facilities, not only to their employees, but also to project-af-
fected people at resettlement sites.
*   CUmm  z mzmuam  LxmnSsZB. The most significant change that occurs as
a result of the construction of a coal mine, is the change in tradi-
tional lifestyles. The construction of a coal mine inevitably intro-
duces an element of modern lifestyle (characterised by salaried
labor, money economy, and a split between production and consump-
tion) into a subsistance economy, largely based on agriculture. This
transition can be extremely painful and introduce new conflict ele-
ments into the local community. The disparity of monetary incomes
created by the employment provided by the coal industry can be per-



- 42 -
ceived as creating new inequalities and give rise to dissatisfaction
among those who have not found employment. The change in lifestyles
will be significant where it affects people, such as tribals, that
depend on forest for their livelihood and who previously had little
contact with the 'outside world.' While the interests of tribals are
protected by special laws, the loss of key resources, such as forest
access, may result in impoverishment, loss of identity linked to a
specific lifestyle, and the disintegration of communities. The sud-
den influx of money furthermore tends to create inflationary pres-
sures in the local economy. This will of course especially affect
those who are on the margin of the money economy, i.e. those who
continue to pursue their traditional livelihood.
3.11 The Government has passed several laws that regulate the acquisition of
land. The primary objective of these laws is to establish an orderly process
for the transfer of land to public sector entities. In addition, Coal India
and its subsidiary coal companies have evolved policies that spell out compen-
sation and rehabilitation measures for people affected by coal projects.
Laws and policies
3.12 In the earlier days of nationalisation, land acquisition was a minor
problem, since Coal India had acquired with the nationalised mines large
tracts of land that were sufficient for the activities of small mines. Small
stretches of land used to be acquired for extension or opening of new mines.
Then land was acquired through private negotiation, the Land Acquisition Act
(LA Act), and the Coal Bearing Areas Act (CBA Act).
The Land Acquisition Act
3.13 The LA Act is the main legislation governing the acquisition of private
lands for both public purposes and companies. Since acquisition of property is
part of the concurrent list of the Indian Constitution, this central Act has
several State amendments. The LA Act is clear that for all land acquired for
the purposes of the Union, the powers would vest in the Central Government;
for all other acquisitions, it would be in the State Governments. In general,
the powers of the District Collector under the LA Act are conferred on Land
Acquisition Officers (LAOs), vho belong to the State Civil Service.
3.14  T  noczas or rano mac==ox. Under Section 4 of the LA Act, the Government
has to publish a preliminary notice identifying the land to be acquired and
invite objections within 30 days. The District Collector arranges for a hear-
ing of any objections to this land acquisition, and prepares a recommendation
to the Government. Based on this recommendation the Government decides whether
to issue a declaration under Section 6 notifying that the land is required for



- 43 -
a public purpose. The public notices under Sections 4 and 6 have to be pub-
lished in two local newspapers and in the official gazette. If the acquisition
of land is urgent, the declaration under Section 6 can be made immediately
after the preliminary notification (Section 17), and the District Collector
may take possession of the land after paying 80% of the estimated compensa-
tion.
3.15 If the Government decides, on the basis of the recommendation of the
District Collector, that the land should be acquired, the District Collector
is instructed to proceed with the land acquisition. He will then serve indi-
vidual notices (under Section 9) to the affected landholders asking them to
file their claims for compensation. The District Collector decides about the
amount of compensation, taking into account the claims and other evidence. The
land can be taken over as soon as the compensation amounts have been paid to
the titleholder.
3.16  CxwmaRTz=. The compensation of land is done according to the market rate
prevalent at Section 4 notification. In practice, this is done by the State
Government authorities (District Collector) by determining the average re-
corded sale prices of the last three years prior to notification. An addi-
tional 'solatium' of 30% is added for compulsory acquisition, and an interest
of 12% per annum is added for the period between notification and the actual
payment. In most cases, the amount will not be sufficient to buy replacement
land in the area because the officially recorded sale price, on which taxation
is based, is often substantially less than the actual price paid, and because
the price of the land in the area will increase with the increased demand
introduced by the subsidiary. The final award of compensation has to be deter-
mined within two years of the declaration of public purpose (Section 6), oth-
erwise the acquisition proceedings must start anew.
3.17 An': affected person who is not satisfied with the compensation may apply
to the District Collector within six weeks of the award. The District Collec-
tor has to refer the complaint to the District Court for adjudication. If the
Court decides in favor of the person who has complained, interest, at the rate
of 9% for the first year and 15% for subsequent years, is payable on the com-
pensation amount.
The Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Act
3.18 Coal companies acquire land for coal mining under the CBA Act. The De-
partment of Coal and the coal companies are vested with powers of land acqui-
sition under the CBA Act.
3.19  Txz zocm or zun  mumsmnov. Based on available geological information, coal
companies submit proposals to the Department of Coal for preliminary notifica-



- 44 -
tion of their intention to prospect for coal in a specific area. This notifi-
cation (under Section 4) permits coal companies to mark out and survey the
land.
3.20 As soon as a coal company has determined that coal can be obtained from
land notified under Section 4, the Department of Coal may (within two years of
the date of the preliminary notification) issue a notice of intention (under
Section 7) to acquire this land. This notice has to be published in th'e Cen-
tral Gazette and requires prior consultation with the State Government. Af-
fected persons may file objections with the Coal Controller at Calcutta. After
considering the report of the Coal Controller, the Department of Coal may
issue (within three years after issuing a notice of intention) a declaration
of acquisition (under Section 9). Following the announcement of the declara-
tion of acquisition in the official Gazette, the Government of India becomes
the owner of the land with all the rights associated with it. The Government
may then turn the land over to the coal company.
3.21 CoKnumos. compensation to land owners is based on the market value (in
practice similar to LA Act compensation) of their land on the day of the pre-
liminary notification (Section 13). If the landowner does not accept the
amount of compensation, or where it is not possible to determine individual
rights over the notified land, the matter is referred to a tribunal, usually
the District Judge in the jurisdiction the land is located (Section 14).
Differences between the Land Acquisition Act and the Coal Bearing Areas Act
3.22 Land acquisition under the CBA Act is more advantageous to coal compa-
nies.
Land acquisition under the CBA Act is carried out entirely by the
Department of Coal and the coal companies. Theoretically, the Dis-
trict Administration is only involved in obtaining copies of village
land records. In practice, coal companies have to rely on the help
of the District Administration in the process of land acquisition,
and frequently seek its 'coercive force' to take over the land ac-
quired. This has led to friction between the Central and State Gov-
ernments, which argue that all lands should be acquired under the
Land Acquisition Act and the CBA Act should be repealed.
Land acquisition under the CBA Act is more authoritarian than under
the LA Act.
-   Project-affected people do not receive individual notices at any
state of the proceedings.
-   Land ownership is transferred to the Government, after the dec-
laration of land acquisition has been issued, without any stipu-
lation that compensation should be paid before taking over the
land.



- 45 -
The CBA Act does not incorporate any of the measures introduced
in the LA Act In 1984 that make compensation more equitable.
3.23 The Government is avare of the many disparities between the tvo Acts and
has been considering possible legislative action to bring the CBA Act more in
line with the LA Act. In the meantime the Department of Coal has issued an
order that makes compensation under the two Acts roughly equal. Box 3.1 summa-
rises the main differences between the two Acts.
Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy
3.24 Before considering the present status of resettlement and rehabilitation
activities within Coal India, it is essential to appreciate the timescale and
duration of mining projects and to recognise that many mines which currently
are operational were designed and commissioned as many as 30 years ago. Within
that time span there have been many progressive changes in the application of
resettlement and rehabilitation in India and within the mining sector, so the
situation seen at an old mine should not be taken as representative of the
current approach of Coal India.
3.25 Standards and approaches have also changed because of the nature of
projects, because of regional differences in policies and their implementa-
tion, and because of variations in the approaches and applications taken by
project personnel. Because of the great number of opencast mines which have
developed over the past 30 years, the current situation of resettlement and
rehabilitation of project-affected people has become quite complex. To appre-
ciate the current situation, the timing of the resettlement and rehabilitation
activity and the situation at the time of project implementation must be taken
into account.
3.26 Coal India's decision to establish a policy for resettlement and reha-
bilitation of project-affected people represents an effort to provide uniform
guidance to subsidiary coal companies, in response to persistent and growing
discontent of project affected people in many locations. The evolution of this
policy has been influenced by several factors. The driving motive has been the
continuous and growing need for land. Until the late 1980s, the coal companies
dealt mainly with the landowners, and ensured their cooperation by providing
employment to families of landholders of a certain size (usually more than two
acres) in addition to paying the compensation for lost assets.
3.27 With the increased mechanisation of the coal mines, the increase of
population with smaller land holdings, and increased political attention to
involuntary displacement, it has become increasingly difficult for the coal
companies to continue this practice. The demand for jobs in the coal companies
for surrendering land has increased and the need for unskilled labor has de-

.
clined with the increasing mechanisation of mining operations. All coal compa-
nies employ more labor than they need.
3.28 The State Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa have responded to
this situation by issuing guidelines for rehabilitation measures, largely
based on the size of the land expropriated. These are formulated UA entitle-
ments for jobs in the coal company for the families of the titleholders. Al-
though first priority is given to those families losing both homestead and one
third of agricultural land, the provisions generally favor larger landowners
by providing employment for one person coming from families losing two or more
acres of irrigated land or three or more acres of unirrigated land. The aim of
these policies seems to be based on the State Governments' wish to secure
employment in the region.
3.29 In 1990, a circular (the so-called Gulla package) was given to all sub-
sidiaries by Mr. O.P. Gulla, Joint Secretary to the Government of India, De-
partment of Coal, Ministry of Energy. This document was the first attempt to
formulate a corporate policy for resettlement and rehabilitation in Coal In-
dia, and has provided the basis for resettlement and rehabilitation activities
up to April, 1994. The circular stipulates the following responsibilities for
the coal company:
a. all new employment opportunities for unskilled and semiskilled labor
must go to land losers,
b. vocational training should be provided to upgrade project-affected
peoples' skills for employment in the coal company,
c. cash compensation for land must be deposited by the coal company to
the District Authorites before taking possession in order to avoid
delays in payment, and
d. a monthly allowance for 20 years, depending of the size of the lost
land holding, should be paid to the titleholder who did not get a
job in the coal company.
3.30 In addition to the provisions made in the Gulla Package, the coal compa-
nies continued to follow the State guidelines of providing employment for one
person coming from families losing two or more acres of irrigated land or
three or more acres of unirrigated land.
3.31  The provision of jobs is regarded by almost all project-affected people
as the most desirable rehabilitation option, since it results in a five-fold
increase of income for most. At present, the average wage is Rs3O,000 (equiva-
lent to about US$1,000) per year for semiskilled or unskilled labor in the
Indian coal mines. This is five times the minimum wage rate. In addition,
employment in the coal mine brings additional benefits, such as free medical
care and subsidised housing. Table 3.2 shows the employment of land oustees

from 1973 to 1993, during which period a total of 33,470 land oustees were
employed by the subsidiaries of Coal India.

Soume: Coal India
3.32 With the phasing out of Government support, Coal India can no longer
afford the heavy financial cost of employing more labor than it needs. Coal
India has therefore imposed severe restrictions on the hiring of new staff
and, in parallel, adopted programs to reduce its manpower. This situation
forced Coal India to rethink its policy of rehabilitating project-affected
people. Since provision of jobs cannot be taken for granted in the future, the
coal companies have had to find other ways to restore the incomes of people
who are adversely affected by the acquisition of land.
3.33 It has long been recognised by the coal companies that not all the
people that live in communities occupying or using land required by the mine
are land owners. This group could be large and may include tenant farmers,
sharecroppers, squatters and agricultural laborers. Until now, these people
have not been entitled to any resettlement and rehabilitation assistance.



- 49 -
However, when resettling a village, the subsidiaries have often provided
accomodation for some of these families at the resettlement site.
3.34 The salient features of the State guidelines, the Gulla package, and the
new Coal India policy are summarised in Box 3.2. Coal India's current policy
(Annex 8) was approved by the Board on April 4, 1994. It represents the latest
stage in a development brought about by the increased challenges confronting
the coal companies when acquiring land. The developement is characterised by
several trends:
*  from recognising only the loss of land in the compensation process
to considering the loss of economic assets,
*  from considering only landowners/titleholders to be dealt with to
considering the surrounding communities as the partner in the re-
settlement and rehabilitation process,
*  from considering landowning families as the unit of entitlement to
considering every adult individual as the unit of entitlement,
*   from acting on the basis of regional guidelines to acting of the
basis of a corporate policy,
*  from provision of employment with the coal company as the major
vehicle of rehabilitation to multiple rehabilitation efforts,
*  from being mainly accountable to the coal company to being primarily
accountable to the project-affected people, and
  from not involving the project-affected people in the planning and
implementation to extensive consultation and participation of
project-affected people in the process.
Inplementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans under the project
3.35 The implementation of the new policy will be a difficult process which
will require substantial attention and support. The policy limits the reha-
bilitation assistance from life-long employment in the coal company to assis-
tance during a limited period, during which the project-affected people also
have to contribute to their own successful rehabilitation.
3.36 This policy will be implemented throughout Coal India, however the fol-
lowing section describes only Coal India's organisational structure for the
implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation in the projects proposed for
Bank funding, and should be considered as an example of the arrangements and
issues that have to be dealt with throughout projects involving resettlement
and rehabilitation. The present project is a learning ground, and as such a
pilot and demonstration project; an area that is relatively unchartered terri-
tory for Coal India.

the States and the policies issued by the Ministry of Coal, mine mRanaers
provided the data in terms of families. In addition, data was only provided

for families affected by land acquisition in the course of project implementa-
tion. No count was taken of families whose land had been acquired earlier and
who continued to cultivate (and in some instances live on) this land with the
permission of the coal company.
3.38 The revision of Coal India's policy for resettlement and rehabilitation
n April, 1994 changed the definition and categories of project-affected
*eople and the data collected earlier had to be re-estimated. Subsidiary coal
-ompanies hired consultants, NGOs and research organisations for doing socio-
.-conomic baseline surveys and censuses of the project-affected persons. The
terms of reference were provided by the Bank.
Status of resettlement and rehabilitation
3.39 out of a total of 31 subprojects proposed for Bank financing, 18 involve
resettlement and/or rehabilitation issues. In these 18 subprojects, a total of
18,225 people (3.899 families) will be adversely affected in the period from
1994 to 2003. During the project period (1994 to 1998) the total number of
people adversely affected will be 16,672. The majority of the project-affected
people (11,750) are located in Orissa, within MCL. Overall, 10,928 people will
lose their houses and will have to be physically resettled. Tables 3.3 and 3.4
provide details. Sixteen subprojects require detailed Rehabilitation Action
Plans. The two remaining subprojects combined will affect only 21 people (4
families), involve no resettlement, and do not require Resettlement Action
Plans, although the affected people will be rehabilitated according to the
same entitlements and principles.
3.40 An overview of project-affected people over 18 years of age and classi-
fied according to the Coal India policy of entitlements is pr,vided in Table
3.5. This table shows that 2,886 landless people who would not have been en-
titled to assistance under previous guidelines, are now entitled to rehabili-
tation assistance.
3.41 A summary of the Rehabilitation Action Plans is provided in Table 3.6.
For the project period, a total of 9,418 persons (3,575 families) are entitled
to rehabilitation assistance. The provision of jobs with the coal company and
contractors is planned to rehabilitate 3,569 people (38%) and 5,853 people
will be entitled to assistance for self-employment. Since these figures com-
prise the total number of entitled persons they are a maximum figure. Some
people may decline the offer for reasons such as old age or because they are
married to persons employed by the coal company; this will be determined in
the process of implementation. If the rehabilitation entitlement had been
provided under the previous guidelines, each family, generally, would have
been given one employment opportunity.

Institutional arrangements
3.42 In order to ensure effective implementation of Coal India's resettlement
and rehabilitation policy. Coal India has agreed to strengthen the implement-
ing organisational structure. However, to build in-house capacity in each
subproject with resettlement and rehabilitation may not be universally the
best solution. Some mines may not have on-going resettlement and rehabilita-
tion issues over the entire length of the project. It is therefore envisaged
that institutional strengthening takes place at the Coal India level and at
the area level. Coal India has agreed to provide the General Manager (Re-
settlement and Rehabilitation)'s office with sufficient resources and manpower
to guide, support and monitor the implementation of the new Coal India policy.
In addition, Coal India is in the process of hiring one consultant, with so-
cial science background and 'hands-on' field experience in community develop-

external consultants may be required for specific tasks, such as periodic
evaluation surveys, case studies to identify self-employment opportunities and
diagnostic studies to identify problems of integration at resettlement sites.
3.43 The major responsibility for implementation of the Resettlement Action
Plans lies with the subsidiary and area level management. Dedicated resettle-
ment and rehabilitation staff are present in several subprojects and/or at
area levels. Coal India has agreed to ensure that they will receive necessary
and relevant training in area where this is needed.
3.44 Coal India has agreed to hire social scientists who will be posted at
the area level and be responsible full-time for resettlement and rehabilita-
tion activities for those projects that require the most assistance for self-
employment. A total of ten professional social scientists will be engaged in
the project, with a minimum of one in each subsidiary where resettlement and

rehabilitation is required. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) will be
engaged to assist in specific tasks, such as training for self-employment and
community development work. The selection of the NGOs is crucial and has to be
done with great care. The NGO must have a proven record of dedicated community
development and income generating activities. The Resettlement and Rehabilita-
tion Cell of Coal India must be involved in the selection procedure and must
approve the selected NGO.
3.45 Coal India has agreed that key resettlement and rehabilitation staff
will, as a general rule, not be transferred within the first three years of
the project.
3.46 The implementation chart for resettlement and rehabilitation at the
subsidiary and area levels is shown in Figure 3.1.

Participation and consultation of project-affected people
3.47 The strategy for the continued participation and consultation of
project-affected people has two aspects. One aspect is the formation of a two
tier committee structure in which project-affect people are represented. At
the project level, a coordination committee will b. essentially responsible
for planning and implementation. At the area (or subsidiary) level, a monitor-
ing committee will be responsible for approvals, monitoring and grievance
procedures. In both committees, it is envisaged that two project-affected
people (preferably one man and one woman) will have seats. These committees
each consist of five people (six if a host community exists). This set-up aims
at institutionalising the participation of project-affected people. The second
aspect of the participation strategy is to break down the planning process
into half-yearly periods. The project level coordination committee is the body
that formally submits the half-yearly detailed plans of implementation to the
monitoring committees. The formulation of half-yearly detailed plans of imple-
mentation makes it possible for experiences gained in one period to be incor-
porated into the next plan, and allows for substantial input from the affected

population. Besides this more formalised participation, it is envisaged that
the day-to-day interaction between project-affected people and project offic-
ers and NGOs involved in resettlement and rehabilitation will provide opportu-
nities for consultation and participation. Figure 3.2 illustrates the commit-
tee structure.
3.48 During the preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans, the affected
people were consulted in various ways:
0  Since every household was visited by the interviewers, this created
an opportunity for consultation. The survey contained questions
regarding affected people's perceptions of issues related to land
acquisition, compensation, benefits of the project displacing them,
and the relocation site and the host cosimunity.
*  All consultants had more unstructured interaction with the project-
affected people than the officials of Coal India. Most of the con-
sultants organised focus group sessions for vazious groups in the
villages, such as women, landless and tribals. This information was
used to formulate a strategy for involvement of the project-affected



- 58 -
people in the Rehabilitation Action Plan, and for their active par-
ticipation in the resettlement and rehabilitation process.
3.49 As a further step in informing the project-affected people of their
entitlements, both the policy of Coal India and the Rehabilitation Action
Plans are in the process of being translated into relevant local languages.
Generally Coal India has issued press statements to newspapers in the affected
areas and in the major cities for the wider dissemination of the policy
change.
Tribal issues
3.50 The project-affected people classified as tribals constitute 5,186 per-
sons, or 28% of all project-affected people (18,225 people). This covers a
large variety, from six mines with no tribal persons to one mine where 100%
(460 persons) are classified as tribals (Jhingurdah, NCL, in Singrauli). In
Madhya Pradesh most (8 of 11) of the SECL mines with residual resettlement and
reLabilitation issues proposed for inclusion in the project have a tribal
population varying from 37% to 88% of the project-affected population. Simi-
larly in Bihar, the two CCL mines with residual resettlement and rehabilita-
tion issues proposed for the project have tribal populations of 77% and 42% of
the total number of project-affected people.
3.51 The official classification of social and/or ethnic groups, and of the
land where they were residing, rest on principles established in 1890, and has
not been changed substantially since. This means that what is classified as
forest area may have been converted into farming land: and that tribal groups,

originally living a migratory life, may have changed their way of living into
a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle.
3.52 With the exception of one mine (Jhingurdah). all the tribal project-
affected population are settled in mixed villages, among caste Hindus and
scheduled caste Hindus. They are predominantly engaged in agriculture on fixed
plots (as opposed to slash and burn cultivation) or crafts related to agricul-
ture (blacksmith, carpentry, etc.). As described in several of the baseline
studies, several of the tribal groups have a special affinity to the local
nature, such as forest and hills and use this in their daily lives, although'
this affinity and use is often shared with other groups in the village. All
the tribals speak the local dialect of Hindu as their first language (except
in Orissa, where they all speak Oriya, the majority language).
3.53 Most of the tribal population is integrated into the Indian rural soci-
ety and have been in contact with mining operations for the past 20-30 years.
Their contact to the 'outside world' is not new and does not consititute a new
threat to the survival of their identity. In places like Madhya Pradesh,
tribals constitute the majority of the local workforce in the mines and have
done so for more than 20 years. The Jhingurdah mine started operating in 1965
and out of the 63 project-affected families (460 persons), 26 families have
persons already employed by NCL.
3.54 In all mine areas (except one) the project-affected population consti-
tutes a mix of scheduled tribes and other social groups (i.e. of different
castes). The implementation of the mitigation plans for these areas require a
community (village) focus, rather than an ethnic group focus, in order not to
create conflict between social groups who have been living in the same mixed
village for several decades.
Communi ty issues
3.55 The emphasis of the subsidiaries has been on providing the resetttlement
sites/villages with facilities and infrastructure, and in many places this has
been done in excess of the requirements of the State Government guidelines.
Socially oriented community development will be introduced at the resettlement
sites in order to improve the relationship between the different villages
brought together and the host communities (if any).
Implementation issues
3.56 The major challange for the implementation of the new policy is to make
the self-employment option an attractive and viable alternative to a job with
the subsidiary. There is no global solution to this. One lesson that has been
learned is that training in itself is not enough, even when it is followed by



- 60 -
loans or grants. The majority of project-affected people are farmers or agri-
cultural laborers, and the transition into another profession probably re-
quires a great deal of follow-up involving business planning assistance and
extension services.
3.57 One of the first activities to be taken up in the subprojects is deter-
mining the persons who are eligible for rehabilitation assistance, popularly
know as %the closing of the list.' The censuses carried out by the consultants
and NGOs for preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plans are fairly accu-
rate, and will form the basis on which the list of entitled persons is to be
determined. In order to ensure that nobody takes undo advantage of the
situtation, and that every entitled person is informed of his or her entitle-
ments, information campaigns will be carried out on a house-to-house basis by
the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Officer of the subsidiary with the assis-
tance of NGOs. This will include the distribution and reading of a brochure
explaining who is entitled to what assistance. A simple identity card (with a
photo of the entitled person) will be issued by the subsidiary. The details of
this procedure have been developed. This procedure is adopted in order to
ensure that people are aware of the scope and limitations of the entitlements.
3.58 The community focus and the emphasis on alternative rehabilitation op-
tions to jobs in the mines are both complex and difficult tasks. In order to
ensure that experiences gained are subsequently utilised, implementation of
the new policy will be done in two phases:
a. immediat. and focused attention on four pilot projects and
b.  by x-"-mberl995, including the remaining 12 subprojects.
3.59 From the operational plans for resettlement and rehabilitation it is
clear that the impact of land acquisitior. for the majority of the project-
affected people will take place in 1995. The selection of pilot projects has
given priority to subprojects with imminent or ongoing resettlement and reha-
bilitation needs (Jagannath (MCL). Jhingurdah (NCL), Parej East (CCL) and
Kusmunda (SECL)). The selection of suitable NGOs could take considerable time,
and the search for NGOs which should be involved in the pilot projects has
already been initiated.
3.60 Technical guidelines for the implementation of the policy will be pro-
duced by the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Cell of Coal India based on the
initial experience in the four pilot subprojects. They will contain opera-
tional details, such as rationale and procedures for verification of the iden-
tities of project-affected people, how to conduct information campaigns, how
to carry out the alternative rehabilitation entitlements, and the time limita-
tions of the entitlements.



- 61 -
3.61 Technical assistance, mainly by local consultants and intense supervi-
sion by the Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell of Coal India, is of prime
importance to the successful implementation of the resettlement and rehabili-
tation policy.
Supervision, monitoring and evaluation
3.62 The resettlement and rehabilitation activities to be carried out in Coal
India are complex, and the successful outcome depends on the timely and coor-
dinated efforts of many people in the implementation of the Rehabilitation
Action Plans. Therefore, close supervision and monitoring and evaluation is
essential.
3.63 Supervision and internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the
Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell of Coal India. Based on the yearly plans
of operation and the half-yearly plans to be submitted, they will guide and
assist the subsidiaries and the resettlement and rehabilitation field staff in
the implementation. They will provide formats for quarterly reporting of re-
settlement and rehabilitation to be submitted to Coal India, and they will
visit the field for verification and to provide feedback.
3.64 The aim of the internal monitoring is to ensure that implementation is
carried out with a minimum of adverse effects on the project-affected people
and that the process of rehabilitation is progressing timely and satisfacto-
rily.

PART IV. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND MINE SAFETY
Introduction
4.01  Concern for safety at the workplace and the health of mine workers in
the Indian coal industry has a long and checkered history. The first framework
of mining legislation, the Mines Act, came into force in 1901. This Act man-
dated the employment of competent managers in mines and the appointment of
Government Mines Inspectors empowered to enter and inspect mines and to in-
quire into mining accidents. The Mines Act and the subordinate legislation
framed thereunder have been periodically updated to absorb technical advance-
ments and the recommendations of International Labor Conferences, the findings
of investigations into mine disasters or the awareness about the causes of
frequent accidents.
4.02 Legislation governing the safety and health aspects in the coal industry
include the Mines Act (1952), Coal Mines Regulation (1957), Mines Rules (1955)
and the Indian Electricity Act (1956). The Mines Act is the enabling statute
for the establishment and enforcement of regulations and standards governing
the mines' safety and the workers' health and welfare. The Act defines the
powers and responsibilities of mine inspectors, mine owners, agents and manag-
ers; establishes committees representing all parties to recommend on rules,
inquire into accidents, decide on appeals and health and safety prescriptions
and hours and limitations of employment; establishes procedures for enforce-
ment and penalties for noncompliance; and has the power to make regulations
and set standards. The Indian Electricity Act sets standards for the safe use
of electricity, safe electrical circuitry and flameproof enclosures in hazard-
ous gassy atmospheres.
4.03 The Coal Mine Regulations cover, among other things, competency certifi-
cations for mine managers and other supervisory staff; duties and responsi-
bilities of various parties; maintenance of mine plans; maintenance of safe
access to and exit from the mines; safe transport of men and material; the
regulation of ventilation, lighting and us of explosives; and precautions
against gas, dust, noise, fire, water inrush, etc. The Mine Rules contain
procedures for setting up committees, courts of inquiry, medical examinations
by certifying surgeons, mine safety committees, etc. Besides the above, adv.-
sory circulars are issued by the Directorate General of Mine Safety (DGMS) on
specific safety issues relating to the use of the plant and equipment or min-
ing practices. Specific measurable standards have been established for air-
borne dust, noise, and lighting for both underground and opencast mines, and
for ventilation and temperature in underground mines (Box 4.1).

4.04 Application, inspection and enforcement of the Mines Act and its subor-
dinate legislation are the responsibility of the Director General of Mine
Safety (DGMS) under the Ministry of Labor. The country is divided into eight
zones, each with a Deputy Director General of Mine Safety. Zones are further
subdivided into regions and sections, headed by Directors and Deputy Direc-
tors, respectively. Besides regular inspection of mines, DGMS officials
organise inquiries into all fatal accidents collect a wide variety of statis-
tics about the opening and closure of mines, manpower employment at different
places of work, cases of fatal and serious accidents, and occurrences of gas,
explosion, fire and inrush of water etc.
4.05 Accident statistics are compiled from the notice of accidents submitted
to the DGMS and from the reports of the officers who inquire into accidents.
Patal accidents are defined as those in which at least one death is involved
and serious accidents are those which cause serious bodily injury to one or
more persons. Serious bodily injury is defined as "any injury which involves
or in all probability will involve, the permanent loss of any part or section
of a body the use of any part or section of the body, or the permanent loss
of, or injury to the sight or hearing of any person or any permanent physical
incapacity or the fracture of any bone of one or more joints or bones or any
phalanxes of hand or foot'.
4.06 Table 4.1 shows, in line with international norms, the trend in fatal
and serious accidents in coal mines expressed as frequency per 100,000 man
shifts and 1000 persons employed, and also the fatality rate per million tons
ot coal production. These statistics reveal that there has been an impressive
decline in terms of fatality rates per 1000 persons. More recent statistics
between 1986 and 1993 show that the rate per 100,000 man shifts has not shown
any improvement. The data would indicate that the accident rate (per 1000
persons employed) for fatalities and serious injuries, has reached a plateau.

4.07 Analysis of the causes of fatal accidents shovs that roof or side falls
(caving in of roofs or material falling from the roofs of work faces in under-
ground mines) account for the largest number of accidents; this is followed by
accidents caused by 'wheeled trackless transportation equipment' (mostly dump-
ers and trucks) and accidents caused by rope haulage and other machinery.
Although the fatalities from roof or side falls show a declining trend in
absolute terms, they still account for 42% of all fatal accidents. This shows
clearly that greater attention needs to be paid to the proper and adequate
implementation of roof control measures, such as steel supports and 'roof
bolting.'
4.08 Table 4.2 presents data on the safety in opencast mines between 1975 and
1993. Eighty percent of accidents in opencast mines can be attributed to heavy
earth moving equipment, and of those, about 75% are caused by wheeled track-
less transportation machinery. Nearly 90% of these accidents are accounted for
by negligent or unauthorised driving, unauthorised riding and being hit by
vehicles while reversing or while crossing haul roads. Many of these accidents
could be prevented through proper training, provision of audiovisual signals
during reversing of trucks, provision of walkie-talkie sets to dumper opera-
tors and spotters, adequate illumination after dark and in smog, improved
(wide angle) visibility from the driver's cabin and adequate maintenance of
brakes. Far too many of these accidents are attributed to 'human error' such
as poor judgment, misinterpretation of signals, forgetfulness, misadventure
and foolhardiness which underscore the imperative need for safety education
and training for behavioral change.

4.10 International comparisons of mine safety need to be interpreted with
some care for several reasons. Definitions of the severity of injuries vary
from country to country; some countries express fatality or injury rates in
terms of man shifts worked, others in terms of man hours worked; there are
also substantial differences in the geological mining conditions, extraction
methods (longwall or bord and pillar), and the level of experience of the work
force. Accident profiles of European countries that employ predominantly the



- 67 -
longwall system cannot be compared with bord and pillar systems because acci-
dents due to falls of roof have virtually been eliminated in longwall with the
use of powered supports.
4.11 In the Republic of South Africa, the rate is defined as the number of
fatalities or injuries that have occurred in one year among 1000 people 'at
work', whereas in other countries it is 'on roll.' Such marked differences in
the statistical bases of computation of accident rates notwithstanding, it may
be revealing to compare the available fatality rates in different coal-produc-
ing countries of the world as presented in Tables 4.4a, 4.4b and 4.4c. on an
overall basis, the rates achieved in Indian coal mines compare favorably with
most other major coal producing countries. Even though the fatality rate per
million tons of production may not be a valid measure of exposure to risk,
Indian figures reveal that there is no room for complacency.

4.12 The background of mine workers in India and South Africa are similar.
They come from rural backgrounds and do not have a long tradition as mine
workers. Most of them are semi-literate. Table 4.5 presents a comparative
picture of fatality and injury rates per 1000 mine workers in Indian and South
African coal industries. Even though there are some basic differences in the
definition of injury rates in the two countries, the Indian coal industry
shows a higher safety record. In the state owned mines in China, the average
number of mine workers killed per million tons of coal production in 1980 was
4.53; this figure has been brought d.own to 1.43 in 1990, as safety has been
given a high priority by the Chinese Government. For the Indian coal industry,
the fatality rate per million tons in 1990 was 0.78 and in 1993 was 0.75.
Mine safety organisation in the Indian coal industry
4.13 There are currently three main routes through which safety in the coal
mines is being promoted: (a) the enforcement agency of the Government, (b) the
coal industry's own safety organisation and (c) various promotional measures
and initiatives. For administering the provisions of the Mines Act, the Gov-
ernment of India has set up the Office of the Director General of Mines Safety
(DGMS), which is the principal enforcement agency. For improvement of safety
in mines, a number of measures have been taken. They include:
a)  drawing the attention of mine management to violations of mine
safety and health statutes;
b) withdrawal of statutory permission to operate a mine or part of a
mine;
c)  serving an improvement notice;
d)  imposition of a prohibitory order;
e)  suspension of the statutory certificate of competency held by mana-
gerial and supervisory personnel, in cases where they have been
negligent in the discharge of their duties; and
f) prosecution of person(s) responsible for accidents.

Note: The basis for reporting injuries in India and South Africa are
different. In terms of the South African Mines and Works Act and negulations
(1977) 'an injury that either incapacitates the injured person from
performing his normal or similar occupation for a period of 14 days or more,
or that causes the injured person to suffer the loss of a limb or part of a
litb, or sustain a permnent dtaability is reportable. In the case of
India, pleasm see paragraph 6 above.

4.14 Besides overseeing compliance of existing legislation through inspec-
tions, inquiries into accidents and dangerous occurrences and other safety
promotional initiatives, the DGMS has also the responsibility of according
approval of mine safety equipment, materials and appliances; development of
safety legislation and standards; and conduct of examinations for the grant of
competency certificates. Among new initiatives launched by the DGMS are the
more intense inspection of accident prone mines and identification of correc-
tive measures, extending technological support through science and technology
research and human resource development through structural training at the
newly opened Mines Safety and Health Academy under CKPDI.
4.15 Coal India has a substantial safety organisation integrated into the
management structure. There are also consultation and workers' participation
through the twin instruments of Pit Safety Committee at the mine level and the
system of 'Workmen's Inspector'. At the subsidiary company level there are
several formal and ad-hoc tripartite committees which take stock of safety
status on a regular basis. The Coal India Safety Board, with representatives
of management, workmen, DGMS and a nominee of the Ministry of Coal, meets
twice a year to review safety performance of the companies. There is addition-



- 70 -
ally a standing committee on safety for Coal Nines which is an apex committee
headed by the Union Minister for Coal.
4.16 The Internal Safety Organisation of Coal India is the principal organ of
the cogl industry in matter of safety. The thrust on safety is supported by
the coal industry's massive program of training and retraining for supervisory
staff and workmen. Besides the initial, refresher and specialised training of
mine workers at vocational training centers, as provided under the Mines Voca-
tional Training Rules (1966), the coal industry has an extensive network of
training institutions, supervisory development institutes and mining training
schools.
4.17 The recently formulated training policy aims to integrate occupational
safety and health, and environmental awareness in all human resource develop-
ment activities. New training modules for basic training of surface (opencast)
and underground workers varying from 12 to 48 days have been finalised, they
provide a comprehensive training of new mine workers. Among other promotional
initiatives for spreading the safety altovement, the industry conducts safety
campaigns (safety weeks) in different coalfields using wide range of tech-
niques to inculcate safety awareness among workers to stimulate inter-colliery
competition. Such annual events also help in upgrading the level of housekeep-
ing during the safety week. There are also first aid and mine rescue competi-
tions held in different coalfield to recognise the importance of speed, effi-
ciency *-4 preparedness. While strenuous efforts are being made to upgrade the
work p1    ;afety, urnless there is ability to identify current hazards and the
skill to eroductively deal with them, the goals for higher safety cannot be
attained.
4.18 Mine emergency plans have been prepared under the Government of India' s
1957 Coal Mine Regulations. Technical assistance will be provided under the
proposed programme to review and, if necessary, update these plans.
Occupational health hazards
4.19 As some 80% of all diseases are environment-induced, if safe water sup-
plies and good sanitation facilities could be provided, a large majority of
the environment induced diseases could be prevented. Section 19 of the Mines
Act (1952) stipulates the provision of adequate quantities of cool and whole-
some drinking water close to the workplace, and Section 20 lays down the re-
quirements for sanitary conveniences. Under Section 25, the diseases which
have been notified as being connected with coal mining operations
pneumoconiosis is the major scourge that has blighted the coal miners.
4.20 The Coal Mines Regulations (1957) stipulate that the permissible stan-
dard of respirable dust at 3mg/m3 of air for coal dust containing up to 5%



- 71 -
free silica. There has been considerable interest in the incidence of
pneumoconiosis among coal vorker since 41 cases were detected in a sample of
259 cases in 1956. Table 4.6 presents the statistics of coal workers'
pneumoconiosis between 1978 and 1991. The apparently increasing number of
cases is not due to actual incidence, but because of the requirement of statu-
tory medical examination since 1978. The 8th Conference on Safety in Mines
called for stricter medical surveillance to conform to ILO Convention Numbers
155 and 161 on occupational health services with particular reference to pre-
vention of occupational diseases. Special efforts are currently underway for
diagnosis of pneumoconiosis among coal workers through radiological screening
at 60 centers in different subsidiaries of Coal India. At present, the per-
centage of coal workers with pneumoconiosis ranges from 8.1% to 17% in under-
ground mines and 1.8% to 3.1% in opencast mines.

4.21 Changing technology has introduced new hazards in the mine environment
such as noise, toxicological hazards and psychiatric problems. Noise, as a
major health risk, has merited scrutiny in the coal industry. Based on the ILO
Code of Practice, the DGNS has recommended the following noise standards:
warning (action) level                 85dB(A)
danger limit for unprotected ears      9OdB(A)
entry only with ear protection         ll5dB(A)
entry to be prohibited                 140dB(A)
Audiometry is currently being introduced as a part of mandatory medical exami-
nation for new entrants and for persons engaged in operations/areas where
noise level exceeds 90dB(A). While noise surveys conducted in the coal mines
have confirmed that the noise problem is not a serious issue, medical examina-



- 72 -
tions of mine workers showed that slightly more than 50% of the workforce
seems to have some degree of hearing impairment. The cause is more likely the
relatively high average age of miners than noise at the workplace..
4.22 Responsibilities for occupational health at the corporate level are
shared by the Chief of Medical Health Services, Coal India and the newly -
created Institute of Occupational Medicine and Hygiene at CMPDI, Ranchi. The
roles of the Chief of Medical Health Services are to liaise with organisations
of the Central Government on national occupational health policy and to moni-
tor the quality and implementation of worker health programs in the subsidiary
companies. The major responsibilities of the new CHPDI institute will be to
carry out extensive monitoring of worker health and maintain a data bank on
employees, to initiate long-term research into the health aspects of coal
mining, and to provide advice and consultancy services to coal companies on
occupational health, industrial hygienic and ergonomics.
4.23 An Occupational Health Wing, headed by a Deputy Chief Medical Officer,
has been established at the central hospital of each subsidiary company. The
responsibility of these units is to provide regular medical screenings and
diagnostic examinations of company employees, to regularly report to company
management on the incidence of occupational diseases amongst mine workers, to
train regional hospital staff in the detection and treatment of occupational
diseases, and to provide ongoing care for employees requiring specialised
treatment.
4.24 As per Mines Rules 29B, periodic medical examination, (after the initial
medical examination at the time of appointment) of every person employed in
the mine is carried out at intervals of not more than 5 years. About one-fifth
of the employees are medically examined every year in rotation. Coal India has
started a computerised health record system, which will cover all employees by
December 1996. Radiology, cardiopulmonary, audiometry, ergonometry and psychi-
atric diagnostic capability will be strengthened at both the corporate and
subsidiary company levels.
Mine rescue program
4.25 Subsequent to the assumption of mine rescue responsibilities by coal
India in 1985, two commissions were established by the Government of India to
recommend priorities for modernisation and the broad types of rescue equipment
that should be procured. A comprehensive modernisation plan for mine rescue
services has now been prepared and is being implemented based on the reports
of these commissions. Four new mine rescue stations are being established and
equipped, and the two existing stations upgraded to the same standard. Train-
ing facilities are being constructed to give a realistic approximation of the
actual conditions encountered in actual rescue and recovery work.

Welfare measuret Coal ZndLa an an Snstruent for aoa-ewmJ.c change
4.26 In the pre-nationalisation era, the were a number of provisions which
aimed at providing a modicum of facilities for health, water supply and other
amenities in the coalfields. For instance, the Mines Boards of Health were set
up in major coalfields as municipal agencies for managing the civic affairs of
urban center in coalfields and also for providing support services for improv-
ing support services for improving the living conditions. Starved of funds,
the impacts of such organisations were only marginal. The Coal Mines Labor
Welfare Fund Act (1947) set up the Coal Mines Labor Welfare Organisation which
provided an umbrella organisation for medical facilities. There was also a
plethora of welfare-related legislative measures for canteens, creches, pit-
head baths, etc., but little progress was made in the implementation of these
measures due to lack of support from the mine owners as well as lack of enthu-
siasm to utilise the facilities by the workers.
4.27 As a result of the nationalisation of coal mines, there has been a sea
of change in the level of funding and resource inputs for welfare of coal
mines (through the creation of a massive social infrastructure) with vastly
upgraded facilities for housing, water supply and medical care. The
nationalised coal sector has also ably discharged its social responsibilities
by building schools and colleges, canteens, promoting cooperatives and provi-
sioning for recreational facilities such as playgrounds, stadiums and gymnasi-
unms. Coal India's expenditure on workers welfare has registered a steep in-
crease from Rs200 (US$6.5) million in 1974-75 to Rs500D(US$161) million in
1992-93 reflecting the industry's commitment to welfare activities. Table 4.7
shows the achievements in physical terms since nationalisation C1975) in im-
proving the quality of life in the coal mining areas.

ANNEX 2 COAL MINING TECHNOLOGIES
Occurrence of coal
1.    Coal occurs as a layer (called a coal seam) in sedimentory rocks. It is
buried under other layers of rocks and alluvium on the top. Often a sequence
of alternating layers of coal and intervening sedimentary rocks (called part-
ing) occurs. The coal seams have varying thickness and are generally inclined
from the horizon dipping at varying inclinations from nearly flat to high
steeping seams. There are two methods of extracting a coal seam: the opencast
method and the underground method.
Opencast mining
2.    Open pit or opencast mining as it is more familiarly known, involves
extraction and removal of the overlying materials (overburden) to expose the
coal sedm, which can then be excavated. The operations of excavation of the
overburden and its temporary removal to allow access to the coal seam are
often carried out by large mechanical excavating shovels teamed with appropri-
ately sized off-highway trucks to cart away the overburden clear of the coal-
bearing area. Another favoured system involves the use of draglines, large
machines which are capable of excavating overburden and casting and dumping it
a distance of up to 200 metres, clear of the coal seam. Since draglines work
without the aid of dumptrucks they can move overburden at considerably less
cost per cubic metre, but there are limitations in their application compared
to shovels and trucks, both as to total depth of excavation and the distance
over which overburden can be carried.
3.    It is rarely necessary to remove all overburden from the coal seams over
the whole mine area at one time. Normal practice requires the removal of over-
burden only from an area large enough to allow room for the mine's excavators
and truck fleet to work safely and efficiently while exposing enough coal for,
say, one or two months market requirement. Should the end-user of the coal be
a thermal power plant, however, the need for exposed and thereby immediately
available coal is normally much larger, in order to safeguard the generation
potential of the power plant, in which case the working-room, or void as it is
normally known, has to be proportionately greater. In consequence, the over-
burden heaps have to be much larger.
4.    The major factor controlling the viability of an opencast coal mine is
the ratio of overburden to coal, measured in terms of cubic meters of overbur-
den to metric tons of coal. Usually, operation of an opencast mine is cGm-
menced where the coal occurs nearest to the ground surface and where the ratio
of overburden to coal is at its lowest value, in order to minimize both the



- 84 -
Page 2 of 6
amount of overburden to be removed and the unit cost of initial coal produc-
tion. As the depth of the coal and its working ratio increase, however, the
working void and the resultant overburden dumps become larger and larger. The
initial dumps are placed outside the area of the coal to be worked since it
would not be sensible to place them over a coal-bearing area where they would
have to be moved yet again to access the coal beneath. As soon as sufficient
space within the mining area has been cleared of coal, dumping of overburden
can commence within the mined out areas. Coal India uses a large fleet of
small excavators and trucks that are indigenously available. This program
supports Coal India's efforts to optimise the mine design and equipment con-
figuration to yield the best results.
5.    In India the opencast mines tend to be very large and eventually reach
great depths. The greater the depth of a mine the greater is the size of work-
ing void and the larger is the area of the overburden dumps. Since some
opencast mines in India have planned production lives of fifty years and more,
it would be too costly to plan on eventual replacement of the dumped overbur-
den material into the mined out areas after mine exhaustion. However, in newer
mines the external overburden is created only in the first 5 - 7 years and
later on the waste rocks are dumped in areas previously stripped of coal. Coal
India's subsidiary companies carry out afforestation of their overburden dumps
in order to mitigate their visual impact and dust generating potential. How-
ever, little or no measures are taken to contour them or to stabilise their
slopes prior to planting uL the seedlings.
6.    Overburden rock has to be broken into smaller sizes. This is done by
drilling multiple vertical holes (between six and twelve inches in diameter)
into the overburden, 'loading' the hole with industrial explosives and blast-
ing the explosives in a programmed sequence. This technique considerably re-
duces the shock-waves generated by blasting. It is also necessary to blast the
thick coal seams typical of Indian mines. Once broken, the coal is loaded into
trucks in exactly the same manner as used in overburden excavation. On large
mines it is then transported to a coal handling plant where it is crushed to a
size acceptable to customers and stored in silos for rapid loading into rail-
cars.
7.    Opencast min's generate airbourne dust which is difficult to eliminate
even in countries cooler and wetter than India. Dust suppression can be effec-
tive, however, with 'good- housekeeping' practices, provided that the neces-
sary water and equipment are available. Noise also can be kept to acceptable
levels by appropriate design of perimeter overburden dumps and well-maintained
noise suppression devices on the mining equipment. Water pollution must also
be avoided or mitigated, since the exposed rock surfaces of the mine overbur-
den and coal are less absorbent than the original surface soils and rainwater
runoff is much accelerated, carrying with it far more silt than before. Sub-



- 85 -
Annex 2
Page 3 of 6
soil water regime is seriously disturbed by opencast mining and the rain water
runoff from the overburden dump tends to pollute the local water channel.
B.    While most of the excavated overburden in a typical Indian opencast mine
is dumped within the areas previously stripped of coal, little effort, until
recently, had been expended in grading (smoothing) the dumped material to a
final surface capable of being used for any purpose more demanding than el-
ementary forestry. The surface produced normally does not allow access and/or
use of any machinery other than tracked equipment. Effective restoration of an
opencast mine means considerable added expense and under the current coal
pricing structure is not considered cost effective. Under existing regulations
the land has eventually to be handed over to the Government at the end of mine
life without financial compensation, either for the land itself or for the
extra work involved in restoration. It should also be bourne in mind that a
typical Indian low-ratio thick seam mine, when finally exhausted, will have an
average ground level which is inevitably much lower than before, after the
removal of perhaps a hundred or more million cubic meters of coal.
underground mining
9.    Generally, opencast operation is restricted to a depth where the cost of
removing the overburden is economical. If the deposit is not suitable for
opencast mining but is still near the surface, it is accessed through level
tunnels (as adit in the hillside) or through inclined tunnels (slopes) when
below the ground. If the depth of coal seam is still excessive, inclined tun-
neling becomes uneconomical. In such cases, the coal seam is reached through
vertical shaft or pit. In many cases in India, mines start with incline
slopes, and later, shafts are sunk at the deeper parts to economise on men and
material transport cost and to improve the access of fresh air nearer the
working places.
Board and pillar
10.   The bord and pillar method of underground mining is the most prevalent
mining technology in India. It involves formation of large (18-36m) square
blocks (pillars) of solid coal by driving two sets of narrow (4-5m wide) in-
tersecting roads (bord) like city blocks. The size of the square blocks of the
pillars depend upon its depth from the surface and the width of roads around
them. Pillars are formed as the mine property is developed from the entrance
towards the boundary and they are extracted during retreat from the boundary.
If the roof strata is weak, the roadways are supported at regular intervals by
wooden supports. As the development advances, rail tracks and conveyors are
laid up to the face for the supply of material to the face and for evacuation
of coal from the face. Fresh air is constantly coursed throughout the mine to
dilute noxious gases, ventilate machinery and provide fresh air to workers.



- 86 -
Page 4 of 6
11.   Most of the production in the bord and pillar system is obtained by
drilling and blasting in the solid coal face. The broken coal is manually or
mechanically loaded into mine cars or chain conveyors. Side discharge loaders
(SDLs) dig up the broken coal in a bucket and load it into a mine car or chain
conveyor laid on the floor, very close to the face. Load haul dumpers (LHDs)
dig up the broken coal, haul it over some distance and discharge it into a
conveyor. In the latter system, it is not necessary to keep the mine car track
or chain conveyor always extended close to the face. Due to their flexibility,
LHDs are becoming more popular in India. A few other mechanised coal loading
techniques are also followed. Coal loading underground is mainly performed by
piece rated workers, who have to perform a minimum workload per shift and are
paid by volume of coal loaded. The job entails removing the loose coal at the
face after blasting, making the place safe, and shoveling coal into mine cars
or chain conveyors.
12.   During final extraction process, a pillar is subdivided into four
smaller squares by dividing it in the middle. These squares are then further
reduced in size by drilling and blasting. The roof at the void created by
extraction of coal is systematically supported by wooden props and chocks
(crib) erected at very close intervals. Supports are withdrawn at an appropri-
ate time and the roof stone is allowed to cave in to fill up the void. If the
surface property above (road. rail line, buildings, water course, water reser-
voir, etc.) is to be protected, solid pillars of coal are left intact below or
the void is packed with sand piped in from the surface as slurry mixed with
water. Due to the presence of wooden supports set at very close intervals
during the extraction of pillars, it is not convenient to practice mechanised
loading of coal, manual methods are more prevalent. Experiments are in
progress to replace some of the wooden supports with roof bolts (a well known
practice in the US) and thus create a wider space between the props for suc-
cessful operation of mechanical loaders. Coal India proposes to introduce the
technology in a major way for achievina higher productivity. Even after ex-
traction of pillars, not more than 50% of in situ reserves can be successfully
exploited. Loss of coal is more severe in thicker seams. Conventional manual
bord and pillar system accounted for more than 95% of underground production
in 1985, but its share has already declined to about 78% in 1993.
13,   Drilling and blasting in the solid coal produce a lot of fine and shat-
ter the roof and floor strata, weakening them. Experiments are proposed to be
conducted with mobile equipment which combines the function of both cutting
and drilling. Similarly, SDLs/LHDs are being combined with a roof bolting
machine for the roadway support. Coal India feels confident that this equip-
ment will be more popular and find wider application as miners get trained.
They are also more economical than the manual coal loading and they can also
perform 'roof bolting' with suitable attachment. Roof bolting can reduce the
need for erection of wooden or steel supports which are manual intensive and



- 87 -
Annaz 2
Page 5 of 6
more expensive. However, mechanised loading accounted for 22% (22.4 million
tonnes) of underground production in 1993. This program supports Coal India's
efforts to mechanise more coal loading and reduce deployment of unskilled
workers.
14.   Favourable geo-mining conditions of multiple thick seams (2-20m) lying
at shallow depth, competent roof and floor strata, and abundant labour at low
wages encouraged the system of manually intensive bord and pillar mining sys-
tem to continue in India long after it became obsolete in other parts of the
world. Since the extraction of thick seam pillars causes very severe subsid-
ence and environmental problems at the surface, the same favourable geo-mining
conditions turn into disadvantages when it comes to the extraction of pillars
thus formed. The low unremunerative government regulated coal price struicture
in the past also did not encourage adoption of any capital intensive
mechanised technology either for development or for extraction of pillars.
There are about 1,800 million tons of coal standing in pillars now, and more
are being added every year. It would take several decades to liquidate these
reserves even if it were technologically feasible. The problem has been posed
to many foreign consultants and equipment manufacturers. No economically and
environmentally viable methods have been found to date.
Longwall mining
15.   Another important method of underground mining is longwall. The adapt-
ability of longwall method of mining to varying degrees of mechanisation, and
the high productivity and rate of recovery of in situ reserves has made it a
popular coal mining technology in the world  Today it is practised in most of
the coal producing countries with high degree of success.
16.   A normal longwall panel is developed by driving a pair of roadways 150
to 200m apart in a coal block for a distance of 600 to 2,000m. At the end of
drivage the two roadways are connected by a straight road, which is called the
longwall face. From here the longwall face retreats toward the starting point
of the drivage. The face is equipped with coal winning, transportation and
roof support equipment. The equipment consists of three major components:
steel plated armoured face conveyor, coal cutting and loading machine (called
shearer) and self-advancing hydraulically powered supports. The shearer rides
on the conveyor traveling back and forth shearing webs of coal and loading it
into the conveyor. A series of articulated steel canopies or beams held up by
hydraulically adjusted steel props provide support at the workplace. As the
extraction proceeds, the conveyor and supports automatically move forward
close to the face and the void behind is filled by caving of the roof stone.
Most of the coal (95%) between the two roadways are extracted. If the coal
seam is more than 3m thick, the extraction is done in two or more slices. A

continuous stream of fresh air is coursed through the face to dilute the nox-
ious gases, ventilate the machinery and provide fresh air to the workmen.
17.   Coal India has been experimenting with this technology for about 15
years. The current production is about 1.5 million tons per year. The geo-
mining conditions in India are more akin to those in Australia, South Africa
and the United States where the mechanised longwall mining has been highly
successful. Since technical assistance for the introduction of longwall in
India mainly came from Europe, where geo-mining conditions are very different
from India, longwall face equipment imported from Europe did not yield the
desired results. Since the gestation period of a longwall face is quite long,
no longwall equipment has been incorporated in this project.

ANNEX 4 OVERBURDEN HANDLING IN OPENCAST COAL NINES
<
1.    The opencast mining of a coal seam involves the excavation and removal
of its overlying strata (overburden) to enable access to the coal itself. In
most cases the coal seam is exposed and excavated only a section at a time.
The size of such a section is determined by many factors, the most important
of which is the necessity to allow the separate excavating-equipment teams
(for overburden and coal) the space to operate without interference while
maintaining a buffer-stock of in-situ coal adequate to ensure regular supplies
to customers.
2.    The economics of opencast coal mining are governed by several factors. A
factor having major influence on the design of the mine itself is the amount
of overburden which has to be removed to yield a tonne of coal. This figure is
known as the working- or stripping-ratio and is expressed in cubic meters of
overburden compared to a metric tonne of coal. Commonly an opencast mine is
sited in an area where the coal seams are exposed at the surface (the outcrop)
and slope downwards from there, becoming deeper with distance from the out-
crop. The working-ratio, in such a case, increases as the depth of overburden
increases. In consequence, the size of the working void, i.e. the hole, that
it is necessary to create above the in-situ coal buffer-stock, is increased
(see Figure 4.1).

of in-situ coal at the bewglming aud end of the mineas life. Shown above, in white. are the corresponding
minimum working voids. emphasizing the increase in volume made neces ary during the life of the mine.
3.    An opencast mine has a mining (coal-bearing) area and surrounding areas
for associated buildings, haul roads, settling ponds, external overburden
dumps, etc. Regardless of the type of equipment used, there is always a need
to strip an initial area of coal and dump its associated overburden outside
the mining area. As mining progresses into deeper areas, it is sometimes nec-
essary to add overburden to the external dump as the working ratio increases.
The most common method of opencast mining used in India is employs large elec-
trical excavating shovels and diesel-engine trucks to strip and haul away the
overburden, thus exposing the coal. It makes economic sense to keep the length
of haul to a minimum to reduce truck requirement and operating costs. In all
cases, therefore, it is logical to dump excavated overburden in areas within



- 92 -
Annex 4
Page 2 of 4
the mine once coal has been extracted from those areas. While it is necessary
to ensure that an adequate area of land dedicated only to out-of-pit storage
of overburden is acquired prior to the commencement of mining operations, it
is equally important to ensure that, during operations, no overburden is
placed outside the mined-out area unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.
4.   Loose, excavated overburden material, when dumped, will assume a natural
angle of repose dependent upon its basic mechanical characteristics. When
first dumped the type of overburden material encountered in most Indian mines
assumes a natural angle of repose of around 37° from the horizontal-for a
time, and given a solid base. If, however, the dump is allowed to remain for
many years without any treatment, it will almost certainly slump to a flatter
angle.
5.   Apart from the safety considerations involved in overburden dumping
there are other, practical long-term considerations. While a 370 slope can be
constructed to the safer overall effective angle of, say, 26° by forming 15
meter wide terraces at every 20 meters of dump height, the intervening 37°
slopes are still incapable of being traversed by agricultural or forestry
equipment (see Figure 4.2). The terraces effectively slow rainwater run-off
and thus reduce erosion due to that cause but the slopes are good only for the
manual planting and harvesting of whatever crop will flourish there.
6.   It is extremely dangerous to attempt to use bulldozers to form terraces
after establishing a dump to its final height since they are susceptible to
sliding and overturning when working on loose material at the slope angles (ca

stage that the dump is to be terraced, then it must be formed in successive
horizontal layers corresponding to the proposed terrace levels. Should this
not be done and terracing is subsequently necessary, then this has to be
formed by additional dumping carried out beyond the established toe of the
dump, star' .; at the base level and working upwards (see Figure 4.3).
7.   In the reverse case, the case where there is no opportunity to extend
the toe of the dump outwards due to the impossibility of acquiring more land,

material would have to be removed from the slope of the dump and placed else-
where. Figure 4.4 shows the sequence of operation which would have to be
adopted. It has to be emphasised that this is a more expensive operation than
adding to a slope (as in Figure 4.3) and possesses an element of danger. The
material on the slope of a dump is unconsolidated and is likely to be inca-
pable of supporting the weight of a large electric shovel on the terraces
shown without collapsing. If the operation were to be attempted, a large
wheeled loader would be more appropriate equipment to load the necessary
trucks. The cost of re-excavating, hauling and dumping material in such a case
is likely to be around $2.00 per cubic meter and could involve as much as five
million cubic meters on a large mine.
Ci)           Here again the overburdun dump has
initially been formed in a single layer
at a slope of 37. However, in this
case the land to extend the toe of the
dump is not available and in order to

transported and dumped elsewhere.
--    -   se of -u Of
8.   What the foregoing implies is that the original mine design must take
account of all factors, not merely of the mining itself but those applying to
final restoration and rehabilitation of the land. Bank engineers' observations
have consistently shown that little or no attention is given in Coal India to
the design of out-of-pit dumps at project planning stage. This situation is
never permissible, even in an improbable scenario having no restrictions on
land acquisition. If adequate land is not known to be available for out-of-pit
dumping at the planning stage then the design of the mine itself must be modi-
fied..
9.   After a large volume of coal is removed from a mine it might be thought
that there would remain a void equal to that volume. However, the associated
volume of overburden increases in bulk when loose, thus negating part of the



- 94 -
Annex 4
Page 4 of 4
void. Overburden can 'bulk' by as little as 10% and as much as 50%, depending
upon its nature and upon the methods used to dump it. On a mine with a ratio
of, say, 7 to 1 and an overburden which bulks by 12%, a perfect balance ex-
ists, where the original ground contour could be re-established on completion
by replacing all the overburden in the void created by the removal of coal.
In countries like the UK, mining regulations insist on the replacement of all
overburden on mine exhaustion, whether or not a balance exists. In the US,
where opencast mines are generally much larger than in the UK and take much
longer to exhaust, out-of-pit overburden dumps must be contoured to slopes
(certainly much less than the 260 previously mentioned) which can be worked by
:-rmal agricultural equipment and covered with recovered topsoil or soil-
making material. The expenditure involved in such work is taken into account
at the planning stage and inevitably affects the mine design, primarily by
reducing the 'cut-off ratio', i.e. the maximum working ratio at which coal can
be economically mined. In both countries, the after-use and geometry of the
mined-out areas are regarded as having immense importance at the planning
stage and during operations.

ANNEX 5 FIVE YEAR CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN, 1995/96 To 1999/2000
Introduction
Coal is India's most important resource of commercial energy, and be-
cause of its efficiency, opencast mining will dominate mining operations. The
location of mining operations is largely determined by the location of coal
reserves and the relative cost of extracting coal. In a densely populated
country, such as India, mining (in particular opencast mining) affects the
lives of increasing numbers of people, directly, through the acquisition of
their land and houses, and indirectly, through the adverse effects of coal
mining on the environment they live in.
For the foreseeable future, India has little choice but to rely on its
coal reserves to meet the rapidly growing demand for energy. With the excep-
tion of some isolated cases, coal remains India's least expensive commercial
energy resource, even if all environmental and social cost are taken into
account. More than two-thirds of India's annual coal production is converted
into electric energy. This gives even the most distant locations access to
commercial energy. Until other, more efficient means of transporting commer-
cial energy are available, coal-based electric power generation will remain
the cornerstone of India's energy strategy.
In recent years it has become increasingly evident that Coal India Ltd.
(Coal India) has to gain the support of the people affected by its operations.
This support is critical in situations where Coal India wants to acquire land
or resettle people in order to be able to expand their operations; it is also
important if Coal India wants to avoid disruptions by people whose lives are
disturbed by mining operations (e.g. dust, damage to houses due to ground
vibration from blasting or dry wells due to a drop in the water table). It is
no longer considered sufficient to provide the compensation prescribed by the
various laws for land acquisition, to compensate people for the damage to
their houses (that have been damaged due to blasting operations) or provide
them with drinking water (if their wells run dry), mining operations have to
be designed so as to minimise adverse affects on people living nearby.
Coal India is mindful of the fact that the mitigation of adverse envi-
ronmental effects and assistance to people who have been affected by land
acquisition affect the profitability of investments in coal mines; and also
has a bearing on other enterprises operating (or planning to invest) in the
same area, since the same benefits would need to be extended to all people
living in the area. Any other approach would be divisive and, in the end,
counterproductive. Coal India therefore has to strike a balance between the
social and environmental mitigating measures dictated by its own interests and

the broader regional developmental concerns. Therefore, it supports regional
initiatives aimed at containing and reducing the adverse environmental effects
of industrial activities and at improving the living conditions of the people
in the region.
As a first step of developing a corporate strategy on environmental
issues, Coal India carried out a review of the implementation of environmental
regulations and the conditions of environmental clearances. The results of
this review, which was based on a sample of about 30 mines showed considerable
delays in the implementation of environmental regulations and conditions. Mine
managers tend to give the highest priority to issues that have direct bearing
on coal output and the safety of operations. Environmental issues are usually
only dealt with if they lead to protests from people living in nearby communi-
ties.
Coal India recognizes that an effective corporate strategy on environ-
mental issues would need to embody two elements: strengthening of Coal India's
capacity (a) to design coal mining operations in a way that minimizes adverse
impacts on the environment and (b) to ensure that these operations are imple-
mented and operated in line with prevailing environmental standards, regula-
tions and (mine-specific) conditions of connent letters. This wil: require
additional staff (with appropriate skills) at the Coal Mine Planing and Design
Institute (CMPDI) and its regional offices, which provide design and planning
support to the subsidiary companies; it will also require an increase of envi-
ronmental staff at the various levels of the coal producing subsidiaries. Once
this is achieved, it will put Coal India in a position to shift towards mine
designs and operations that are environmentally benign and, at the same time,
bring its existing operations into compliance with environmental regulations
and the conditions stipulated in the letter of approval (consent letter) is-
sued by the MOEF.
Coal India is currently in the process of formulating a corporate strat-
egy on environmental issues. This annex provides an overview of the main ele-
ments of this strategy, in particular Coal India's plans to strengthen its
capacity to deal with environmental issues.
Objectives
Coal India is committed to comply with all environmental laws, regula-
tions and the conditions contained in MOEF's snvironmental clearance letters.
More specifically, Coal India's corporate environmental policy aims at:
integration of mine design and environmental impact management to
allow the company to meet environmental standards, laws and regula-
tions efficiently and with the least adverse impact on the ambient
environment and the people living near mining operations;

e mitigation of adverse impacts that cannot be avoided;
* implementation of measures that would ensure productive use of the
land after mining activities have been completed.
Strategy
To achieve these objectives, Coal India will take the following steps:
*   Strengthen Coal India's capacity to deal with environmental issues.
- Assess the training needs of its staff to deal with environmen-
tal issues.
- Implement appropriate training programs. (Coal India has re-
quested IDA financing for an extensive training program of its
environmental supervision staff.)
- Supplement training of Coal India staff vith hiring of people
with specialized skills.
*   Ensure that environmental rules and regulations are followed and
conditions of Letters of Consent are implemented.
-  Review the existing environmental monitoring and auditing sys-
tems and, if necessary, introduce appropriate changes to ensure
that all environmental rules and regulations (as well as the
conditions in consent letters) are implemerted in a tin,ely man-
ner.
-  Construction o' environmental laboratories by CMPDI and the
subsidiary companies. Coal India has requested IDA financing for
this.
-   Preparation of environmental action plans for mines where delays
in the implementation of environmental measures have created
safety c. health hazards.
-  Coal India will make a systematic effort to raise the awareness
of its managerial staff about the importance of environ=.ntal
issues by introducing this subject in training courses in the
university(ies) for executives and non-executives.
*   Integrate mine design and environmental management.
-  Review current mine design and planning practices and identify
changes that would allow for full integration of environmental
(impact) management and reclamation objectives with efficient
mining operations.
-   Coal India will initiate a review of its experience with current
mitigation practices with MOEF with a view to improve their
effectiveness and cost. The views of NGOs and representatives of
people living in mining areas will be sought.
To implement the steps outlined above, Coal India will strengthen its envixon-
mental organisation. The functions and responsibilities of the various ele-
ments of this organisation are described beluw.

Staffing, training and technical assistance
Cadre descriptions
nvxmwmsaL mn===T .rauzsU. Planning a coal mine project involves inputs
from various engineers and technical personnel e.g. geologists, mine planners,
electrical and civil engineers, mine safety engineers and environmental engi-
neers. Environmental considerations need to be built in to the planning pro-
cess of a project. Experienced engineers from disciplines such as environment,
mining, civil, geology etc. have backgrounds that will facilitate their train-
ing as environmental management planners. Coal India believes that executives
with experience in coal mining will be best suited for this job after suitable
training and exposure. Their primary responsibility will be to ensure that
project designs are 'environmentally benign', integrate production and envi-
ronmental management objectives and facilitate the intended reclamation goals.
Training will be provided at Coal India's facilities in Ranchi and on site.

is a must in the coal projects. These can be drawn from PHE, Civil or Environ-
mental disciplines. With suitable exposure, formal training and association
with pollution control agencies this cadre could be developed.

Staff trai ng and technical assistance
The build up of technical expertise for effective compliance of environ-
mental provisions needs training of the involved personnel. There are four
clear training facets leading to achievement of the objectives:
* Environmental planning to be integrated with the Project Report
Preparation.
*   Execution of mitigational measures for controlling pollution.
* Monitoring and evaluation of planning and execution of the
mitigational measures and
* Suitably modifying the planning and execution guidelines for better
results, if required.
To make environmental personnel responsive, responsible and committed to
environmental safeguards, training on all the above facets is required. Be-
sides classroom training, on site training on demonstration projects by in-
volving the experts from within the country and from abroad will be provided.
The framing up of suitable training schemes and their effective implementation
in the classroom and field situation is quite a specialised job for which
suitable consultants (from within and outside the country) will be engaged.
Coal India wishes to use part of the technical assistance component of
the proposed coal sector loan to develop practical training programs for ex-
isting and inducted staff and new recruits. Programmes for immediate training
needs are:
*  An environmental and social impact appreciation short-courses for
senior management on environmental regulations, objectives and stan-
dards, and management's responsibilities in the management of envi-
ronmental and social impacts;
*   The design, construction and operation of minesite surface water
control and treatment schemes; for the engineers at the project/area
levels;
*   The design, construction and recontouring of overburden dump systems
for stability and eventual reclamation;
*   Reclamation plant species selection and revegetation techniques;
*   The effective design and operation of air and water quality and
noise monitoring networks; and
*   Environmental inspection and compliance auditing techniques.

housed in the main offices of the units. No separate office accommodation is
called for except perhaps at the project level. For constructing an office
with 300m2 floor area, provision is being kept for all the subprojects. For
construction of office at project level, a period of two years (i.e. 1995-97)
is envisaged at a construction cost of Rs.4,0 O/m2.

velop these facilities under their Regional Institute to cover the subprojects
with effective environmental monitoring. Five laboratories are to be estab-
lished, two in SECL and one each in MCL, WCL and NCL. The environmental labo-
ratories at Institute of Environmental (CMPDI- HQ) shall cater to CCL and will
render specialist services to the five Regional Laboratories being set up in
the Regional Institutes. The construction cost of four laboratories with 400m2
floor area for each laboratory will be Rs.1,600,000.

for plant propagation. Generally, however, the sapplings are purchased from
State forest department and large scale facilities are not required to be
developed. Therefore, to start with, a plant Nursery facility will be devel-
oped with an outlay of about Rs.600,000 in each area under this project.

BINA
FIvE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine: Bina
Conpany:  NCL
State: Uttar Pradesh
Coalfield:  Singrauli
Year of sanction:  1973
Operational startup:  1974
Type of mine:  Opencast
Mining method:  Dragline/Truck & shovel
Annual production:  5.5 million tonnes
Capacity:  4.5 million tonnes
Mine life:  30 years
Residual life:  16 years
Number of coal seams:  2 (Thickness: 11 & 20.8m)
Ash content:  25-40%
Strip ratio:  2.2:1
Max. quarry depth:  165m
Coal destination:  Obra, Renusagar and other northern
India's thermal power stations
Current environmental status
Enrixonmental setting
The Bina project is located on hilly terrain forming a plateau on the
west and southwest, whereas towards the east and northeast, the area is gently
undulating. General elevation in the mining area varies from 275m to 400m
above sea level. The mining area lies in between Marrak block on the south and
Kakri opencast project in the north. The drainage of the area is controlled by
seasonal streams which discharge into Gorbanda nallah and ultimately drain
into Gobinda ballav pant sager in the south. Parasi village and Panjreh vil-
lages are located nearby. There are four thermal power plants within lOkm
radius of this project: VSTPS, SSTPS, ATPS, and RTPS.
Baseline monitoring
Because of the age of this project, no true baseline information exists.
However, for preparation of the EMP environmental quality data was generated
in 1987. Air quality stations were established at the mine site and colony,
noise level stations at mine site and colony and water quality stations at
main sump and reservoir near the mine. All the results were found within the
permissible limits. In 1990, however, NCL undertook a regional monitoring
programme as a benchmark to establish future trends in environmental quality.



- 116 -
For this study 30 air quality stations, 24 noise stations and 44 water quality
stations were established.
Mine planning and design
The general strike of the project is north to south with a westerly dip
of 2° to 50. The angle of the dip generally increases from south to north.
Considering the prevailing geomining condition, techno economics and environ-
mental impacts, the combination of dragline and shovel/dumper has been envis-
aged as the method of mining in Bina project. The total volume of overburden
to be handled is 238.7 million ml out of which 30 million m3 (12.6%) is exter-
nal dump and the remaining 208.7 million m3 will be backfilled in the decoaled
area. The external dumping area is 60ha. No further external dumping is pro-
posed to be done. Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the
end of the current five year period 1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to
the total 30 year mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Presently air quality information is collected at the mine site near the
VTC building, colony and adjoining the proposed mine site, Bina Mine-II. Water
quality data is collected from mine sump, workshop effluent, siltation pond,
tap water in the colony and Gorbanda nallah. Noise level monitoring is done at
the mine site, workshop and colony. The monitcring results are within permis-
sible limits.
Hydrology and water quality managqement
Water from the pit sump is discharged, along with surface runoff from
the CHP etc., to the Gobind ballabh pant dam. Problems with coal fines con-
tamination have been experienced with this discharge. Therefore, the discharge
water is passed through a settling tank near the GM office. At the present
time, about 105km of garland drain has been constructed. Settling tanks have
been constructed to treat effluent of the vehicle washing shop. The workshop
has been provided with an oil and grease trap. Analytical results from the
water samples show that all parameters are within the permissible limit.



- 117 -
Air quality and noise management
At present the temporary CHP (capacity 1.8 million tonnes per year) is
generating some airbourne dust. A water spraying system has been installed at
all transfer points, the crusher and the loading points. All conveyors are
covered. The permanent CHP of 4.5 million tonnes per year is likely to start
by June 1995. A misting system with chemical additives is being installed in
the permanent CHP. All conveyors will be fully enclosed. All pit roads are
regularly watered. Main haul roads are metalled and permanent service roads
are paved. Greenbelts have been established around the colony and along most
of the service roads. As a result of these dust control measures suspended
particulate levels regularly comply with air quality objectives.
Disturbed land reclamation
There are seven external dumps. All but one, which is 47m high, are
below 30m in height. Regrading, leveling and resloping of all the dumps is in
progress. In place of top soil spreading, planting is being done by putting
top soil in the pits dug for the plants. Technical reclamation is expected to
be completed by March 1996. Well organised internal backfilling is taking
place with modest resloping and approximately to original contours. Extensive
tree plantings have been established on the tops of external overburden dumps,
and some recontouring and planting has been undertaken on some internal dumps.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
The concentration of industrial activiLies in the Singrauli area must
lead eventually to the need for regional approaches to environmental monitor-
ing, management and land use planning.
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The existing air monitoring stations have been considered adequate. For
frequency of air sampling, samples are drawn on a 24 hourly basis for two days
in a month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At present
CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be complied
with after its notification. Water quality stations have also been considered
adequate. Water quality and levels of wells/bore wells will be monitored quar-
terly in one of the villages adjacent to the mining operation. No change in
the noise monitoring programme is envisaged. Monitoring stations will be
reorganised after notification of CPCB guidelines for coal industry.

Hydrology and vater quality management
Th,4 sediment trap at the washing plant will be cleaned regularly. Stud-
ies to determine the adequacy of sewage disposal to ground in the colony area
will be completed by December 1996. The remaining 3km of garland drain will be
completed by March 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Up until March 1995 planting in 468ha of land has been completed. The
current dust and noise suppression programme will continue.
Disturbed land reclamation
The current backlog of reclamation is 310ha and during the next five
years 84ha more backfilled area will be available. The backlog will be re-
claimed at a rate of 74ha in 1995-96 and 80ha per year from 1996-97 to 1999-
2000. The average reclamation cost for the five years will be Rs20.6 million
in 1995-96 and Rs22.3 million per years from 1996-97 to 1999-2000.

DUDHICHUA
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine:    Dudhichua
Company:    NCL
State:    Madhya Pradesh
Coalfield:    Singrauli
Year of sanction:    1980
Operational startup:    1981
Type of mine:    Opencast
Mining method:    Dragline/Truck & shovel
Annual production:    5.0 million tonnes
Capacity:    10.0 million tonnes
Mine life:    45 years
Residual life:    32 years
Number of coal seams:    3 (Thickness: 8, 9.5 & 18.8m)
Ash content :    20-351
Strip ratio:    3.3:1
Max. quarry depth:    235m
Coal destination:    Western India power houses (Wanakbari,
Kota) and Vindhyachal super thermal power
station of NTPC
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The minesite is situated on a low plateau bordered on its south side by
a steep, approximately 60m high, escarpment. Colony areas and mine infrastruc-
ture are located below the escarpment. Five villages (Chilkadand, Dudhichua,
Kanwar, Churidah and Madhouli) are affected by mining activities. In the
premining stage, the run off from mine area was partly flowing into Bijul
nallah and partly into Ballia nallah. In the post mining stage, run off from
the whole minefield will flow into Gobind ballabh pant sagar through Ballia
nallah. The Project is located between Jayant opencast project on the west and
Khadia opencast project on the east. There are four thermal power plants
within a l0km radius (VSTPS, SSTPS, ATPS, RPTPS). The premining land uses of
the 1,694ha leasehold consisted largely of forest (779ha) and unoccupied scru-
bland (805ha) used for rough grazing, minor dryland cropping (9Oha), and
dwelling sites(20ha).
Baseline data
No true baseline information exists as the project started in 1980.
However, for preparation of the EMP, environmental data was generated in June

1988. Air quality stations were at mine site and colony; for noise at the
mine, workshop and colony; and for water quality, at mine sump, workshop and
Ballia nallah. The results were found within permissible limits, except for
TSS concentration in workshop effluent. In 1990, however, NCL undertook a
regional monitoring programme as a benchmark to establish future trends in
environmental quality. This study involved the establishment of 36 air quality
stations, 24 noise stations and 44 water quality stations.
Mine planning and design
The general strike of the project is NW-SE and dip is towards the north-
east which varies from 1 in 20 to 1 in 25 (2° to 3°). Considering the geomining
conditions, deployment of two draglines in tandem for stripping of the main
bench over the Turra Seam were envisaged and deployment of shovel/dumper com-
bination for the parting between Turra and Purewa seams has been planned. The
total volume of overburden to be handled is 1133 million ml3, out of which 134
million m3(11.8%) is external dump and the remaining (999 million m3) will be
backfilled in decoaled areas. The coal from the face is transported to the
crushing plant and CEP. It is dispatched to SSTPS through NGR system. Areas of
the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total 45 years mine life
are as given below:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Air quality information is collected at the mine office, the colony rest
house and a local village (Madhauli). Water quality data is collected from the
pit sump discharge and in the Ballia nallah upstream and downstream of the
minesite. Noise is measured at the CHP, Madhauli village and the colony. The
monitoring results are within permissible limits.
Hydrology and water quality management
Water from the pit sump is discharged, along with surface runoff from
the coal handling plant, to the Ballia nallah. Problems with coal fines con-
tamination have been experienced with discharge. Concrete settling tanks have



- 123 -
been constructed to treat washwater. The maintenance shop has a well function-
ing oil and grease trap.
Air quality and noise management
Dust control in the coal handling plant is very comprehensive. Misting
systems with chemical additives have been installed at all transfer points,
the crusher and the loading silo. All conveyors are totally enclosed. All pit
roads are regularly watered. Main haul roads are metalled and permanent ser-
vice roads are paved. Green belts have been established around the colony and
along most of the service roads. Up to March 1995, planting of 1.2 million
plants on 450ha has been completed. As a result of these dust control mea-
sures, suspended particulate levels regularly comply with air quality objec-
tives.
Disturbed land reclamation
out of 134 million m3, 70.49 million m3 has been dumped as an external
dump in Uttar Pradesh. Part of this material, covering an area of 63ha, has
been reclaimed. Old external overburden dumps are amongst the highest and
steepest observed on any project, being 60-70m high with slope angles of ap-
proximately 40° and much evidence of mass wasting. Well organised internal
backfilling is taking place with modest resloping. Extensive tree planting has
been established on the tops of external overburden dumps and some
recontouring and planting has been undertaken on some internal dumps.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
The concentration of industrial activities in the Singrauli area must
lead eventually to the need for regional approches to environmental monitoring
and management and land use planning.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The existing air monitoring stations are considered adequate. For fre-
quency of air sampling, the samples are being drawn on 24 hourly basis for two
days in a month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At
present, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. Water quality stations are also consid-
ered adequate. Water levels and quantity of wells/borewells will be monitored
quarterly in one of the villages adjacent to the mining operation. No change
to noise monitoring programme is envisaged.



- 124 -
Hydrology and water quality management
Grease and sediment traps will be constructed to treat wash water and
site drainage. Site drainage from the CUP will be collected and treated prior
to discharge. It is anticipated that a common settling pond will treat both
effluents. These systems will be operational by June 1996. The remaining 3.6km
garland drain systems around the toe of the external dutmps, linked to settling
ponds, will be completed by December 1996. Studies to determine the adequacy
of sewage disposal to ground in the worker and resett..ement colonies will be
undertaken and completed by June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Current dust suppression activities will continue with the addition of
another water tanker for haul road watering. A new effective misting system
will be installed at the feeder breaker by December 1995. Planting will con-
tinue.
Disturbed land reclamation
In view of the poor results to date in reclaiming overburden slopes at
over 35°, in future, physical reclamation will achieve the maximum slope of 280
stipulated in the project's letter of consent before revegetation is carried
out. An engineering study will be undertaken for stable slope for the old
overburden dumps during 1995-96 and 1996-97. On the basis of the study result,
the reclamation will be made from 1997-98 onward. Reclamation of backfilled
area will continue.

Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Jayant project is situated on a plateau with elevation varying from
375-425m above sea level except one hill on NW corner having an altitude of
500m. The most important stream around the area is Modwani nallah. The drain-
age of the area is controlled by seasonal streams which discharge into Modwani
nallah and ultimately into Gobind ballabh pant sagar in the south. Panjeh and
Parasi Villages are likely to be affected due to mining operations. The
project is located between Dudhichua opencast project on the east and Nigahi
opencast project on the west. There are four thermal power plants in the re-
gion (VSTPS, SSTPS, ATPS and RPTS).
Baseline data
No true baseline information exists as the project started in 1975.
However, for the preparation of the EMP, environmental quality data was gener-
ated at the mine site and colony and water quality from the main sump. All
results were within permissible limits. In 1990, however, NCL undertook a
regional monitoring programme as a benchmark to establish future trends in
environmental quality. For this study, 30 air quality stations, 24 noise sta-
tions and 40 water quality stations were established.

Mine planning and design
The strike of the coal seam is from east to west and its dip varies
between 10 to 30 in a northern direction. In view of the prevailing geomining
condition the use of the dragline with shovel dumper combination was adopted.
It is planned that the dragline would handle the large volume of overburden
just above the coal benches and backfill the void. The total volume of over-
burden to be handled is 907.3 million m3 out of which 60 million ml (6.61%) is
external dump and the remaining 847.3 million m3 will be backfilled in the
decoaled area. Coal is dispatched to NTPC through CHP by NGR system- Areas of
the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the 41 years mine life are as
follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Air quality data is collected at the mine site, field workshop, CaP and
CWS colony (Executive hostel). Water quality data is collected from the mine
sump, workshop effluent, CHP effluent, drinking water tap and Modwani nallah.
Noise levels are measured at the mine site, workshop and in the colony during
day and night time. The monitoring results are within permissible limits.
Hydrology and water quality management
Water from the pit sump is discharged along with surface runoff from the
CHP to Modwani nallah. Problems with coal fines contamination have been expe-
rienced with this discharge. Concrete settling tanks have been constructed and
are operative in the washing plant. The workshop has a well functioning oil
and grease trap. An adequately sized settling pond has been constructed to
treat pit sump and CHP discharge. An llkm long garland drain has been con-
structed. The monitoring results are within permissible limits.
Air quality and noise management
Dust control in the CHP is very comprehensive. Nisting systems have been
installed at all transfer points, the crusher and the loading silo- All pit

roads are regularly watered. Main haul roads are metalled and permanent ser-
vice roads are paved. Greenbelts have been established around the colony and
along most of the service roads to keep the SPM level within limits.
Disturbed land reclamation
old overburden dumps on about ll9ha of land are have slopes of more than
350 and are above 40m in height. Extensive planting has been established on
the tops of external overburden dumps and recontouring a-,I planting has been
undertaken on internal dumps. External dump slopes are extremely long and
steep and cannot be reclaimed without substantial slope reduction and terrac-
ing.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
The concentration of industrial activities in the Singrauli area must
lead eventually to the need for regional approaches to environmental monitor-
ing management and land area planning.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-20D0
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluations
The existing air monitoring stations are considered adequate. For fre-
quency of air sampling, the samples are being drawn on 24 hourly basis for two
days in a month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At
present, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. Water quality stations are also consid-
ered adequate. Water levels and quality of wells/borewells will be monitored
quarterly in one of the villages adjacent to miring operation. No change to
the noise monitoring programme is envisaged.
Hydrology and water quality management
One separate adequately sized settling pond will be constructed to treat
the CHP discharge by December 1996. The sediments trap at the washing shop
will be cleaned regularly and the sediments will be dumped in overburden dumps
from October 1995. Studies to determine the adequacy of sewage disposal to
ground in the colony areas will be completed by December 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Up to March 1995, 1.95 million saplings have been planted. The current
dust and noise suppression program will continue.



- 130 -
Disturbed land reclamation
The slope stability of the old dumps having heights of more than 40m
will be scientifically assessed. These studies will be completed by CHPDI by
December 1996. Based on the findings, the resloping and biological reclamation
for the dumps will be caLrried out.

State:    Madhya Pradesh
Coalfield:    Singrauli
Year of sanction:    1977
Operational startup:    1965
Type of mine:    Opencest
Mining method:    Drag'line/Truck & shovel
Current production:    3.4 million tonnes
Capacity:    3.0 million tonnes
mine life:    50 years
Residual:    21 years
Number of coal seams:    2 (Thickness: 132-138m & 9-20m)
Ash content:    22-33%
Strip ratio:    1.5:1
Max. quarry depth:    290m
Coal destination:    Renusagar thermal power station
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The incrop of the coal seam occurs in a crescent shape. The northern
half of the sub basin was upthrown by a fault and deposits were washed away
exposing the metamorphics on the north. Chatka nallah in the south of the
quarry flows from east to west and joins Bijul nallah in the north. Bijul
nallah ultimately flows into Sone river. Churki and Jhingurda villages are
being affected due to mining activities. There are four thermal power plants
in the Singrauli coalfields: namely VSTPS, SSTPS, ATPS, and RPTPS.
Baseline data
Because of the age of this project no true baseline information exists.
e          However, for preparation of the EMP, environmental data was generated in 1989.
Air quality stations were at the mine site and colony, noise level measuring
stations at minesite and colony and water sampling stations at the mine sump
and Chatka nallah. The results were found to be within permissible limits. In
1990, however, NCL undertook a regional monitoring programme as a benchmark to
establish future trends in environmental quality. For this study, 30 air qual-
ity stations, 24 noise stations and 44 water quality stations were estab-
lished.

Mine planning and deslgn
The dip of the coal deposits is centripetal and varies from 9° to 110
Considering the geo-mining condition, deployment of a shovel/dumper combina-
tion, both for coal and overburden, was planned. The coal is dispatched by
aerial ropeways to Renusagar Thermal Power station and by railways to other
consumers. Due to the steep gradient of the coal seams (90 to 110) and the
possibility of mining of Jhingurda bottom seams, all overburden will be dumped
outside the quarxy area as external dumps. Since there is no internal dumping,
the whole excavated area will remain as a void and will act as water body. The
surface area of the water body at 350m above sea level is 205ha. Areas of the
leasehold occupied by mine facil ites to the end of the current 5 year period
(1995-96 to 1999-2000) dnd anticipated to the total 50 years mine life are as
follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Air quality information is collected at the mine site, electric substa-
tion and officers' transit camp. Water quality data is collected from the mine
sump, workshop effluent and from the coannel leading to Chatka nallah. Noise
is measured at the mine site, workshop and colony during day and night. The
monitoring results are within permissible limits.
Hydrology and water quality management
Total runoff from the mine area is accumulated in the sump and is then
discharged to Chatka nallah. Discharge from the CHP is accumulated into pits
for slush accumulation and then it is reused. Concrete settling tanks have
been constructed for the washing shop. The workshop has a vell functioning oil
and grease trap. Runoff from the northwestern and northern dumps will flow
into Chatka nallah through a drain with a silt arrester. A 4.3km garland drain
has been constructed. The monitoring results are within permissible limits.



- 135 -
Air quality and noise management
Dust control in the CHP is very comprehensive, an atomised dust suppres-
sion method is being practiced. Dust extractors have been installed for mini-
mizing the dust fcrmation. All the pits are regularly watered. Main haul roads
are metalled and permanent service roads are being paved. Greenbelts have been
established around the colony and along most of service roads. As a result of
these dust control measures, suspended particulate levels regularly comply
with air quality objectives.
Disturbed land reclamation
Old overburden dumps of 44ha in the south side of the quarry area have
been reclaimed and planted. At present there are three external dumps: north
western, northern and eastern.
Regional cumulative environmental Impacts
The concentration of industrial activities in the Singrauli area must
lead eventually to the need for regional approaches to environmental monitor-
ing management and land use planning.
EnvIronmental management programes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The existing air monitoring stations are considered adequate. For fre-
quency of air sampling the samples are being drawn on 24 hourly basis for two
days in a month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At
present CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. Water quality stations are also consid-
ered adequate. Water levels and the quality of wells/borewells will be moni-
*tored quarterly in one of the villages adjacent to the mining operation. No
change to the noise monitoring programme is envisaged.
Hydrology and water quality management
Two adequately sized settling ponds are in place to treat pit sump and
CHP dis-charges. The sediment trap at the HEMM wash facility will be cleaned
out regularly and sediments disposed off in the open pit. Some 3km of garland
drains will be completed by March .1996. Studies to determine the adequacy of
sewage disposal to ground in the colony will be completed by December 1996.



- 136 -
Air quality and noise management
The current dust and noise control programme will continue. Up to March
1995, about 1.2 million saplings have been planted.
Disturbed land reclamation
Reclamations of eastern and northern dumps will start in 1995-96. The
northwestern dump will have five level& with the maximum dump top at a level
of 490m. The eastern dump will have two levels with the maximum dump top at a
level of 470m and the northern dump with a single level of 433m. The reclama-
tion of the eastern dump will start during 1995-96, the northern dump from
1995-96 to 1997-98 and the northwestern dump in 1998-99.

Strip ratio:    3.8:1
Max. quarry depth:    240m
Coal destination:    Vindhyachal STPS of NTPC
Current environmetal status
Environmental setting
The mine is situated on a hilly plateau with elevation of about 400-500m
above sea level. Some relief elevations exceed 500m. In the western part, the
plateau is pronounced by a steep escarpment. The elevation of escarpment at
the top is 405m and at the base is 315m. Further to the south, the plateau
turns into plain land with elevations of around 300m. The drainage of the area
is divided in two sections: one flowing towards the north into Bijul nallah
through Mehrauli/ Morwa nallah and the other towards the south into Gobind
ball0bh pant sagar through Nodwani and Amjhore nallah. The mine lies between
Jayant opencast project on the east and Amlohri opencast project on the west.
Nigahi, Mehrauli Parewa, Nuher, Amjhar and Gharauli villages are likely to be
affected due to mining activities. There are four thermal Plants namely VSTPS,
SSTPS, ATPS and RPTPS within a 10km radius.
Baseline data
No true baseline information exists. However, for the preparation of the
EMP environmental data was generated in 1986. Air quality stations were at the
mine site and colony; noise level stations were at the mine site and colony;
and water quality stations were at the main sump and Norwa nallah. All the



- 140 -
results were within permissible limits. In 1990, however, NCL undertook a
regional monitoring programme as a benchmark to establish future trends in
environmental quality. For this study 30 air quality stations, 24 Noise sta-
tions and 44 water quality stations were established.
Mine planning and design
The strike of the project is east-west in the eastern part and swings
slightly to the south in the western part. The seams are dipping at 10 to 4° to
the north. In view of the geomining factors, the mine is being worked by dra-
gline and shovel/dumper combination. The dragline is removing the parting
between Turra and Pureva bottom seams and the shovel/dumper combination is
deployed for coal and removing the parting between Purewa top and bottom
seams. The total volume of overburden to be handled is 1850.8 million i3, of
which 1570.1 million m3 (85%) will be dumped internally and 191.8 million m3
and 88.1 million m3 in the sourthern and western external dumps respectively.
Overburden dumps will be formed in benches of 30m in height. The southern
external dump will be formed in seven levels and the western external dump in
five levels. The internal dump will have eight levels. The area occupied by
external dump is 473ha. At present, well organised internal backfilling with
modest slopes and approximate original contours is taking place. Area of the
leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Air quality information is collected at the mine site, electrical sub-
station, near the workshop, colonies and Meharauli Village. Water quality data
is collected from the siltation pond, workshop effluent, openwell and dcmestic
effluent. Noise is measured at the mine site, workshop and Nehrauli village.
The monitoring results are within permissible limits.
Hydrology and water quality management
Water from the pit sump is discharged along with surface runoff from the
CHP to the settling pond. Concrete settling ponds have been constructed for



- 141 -
the washing shop. The workshops have a well functioning oil and grease trap. A
1.5km garland drain has been constructed. The monitoring results are within
permissible limits.
Air quality and noise management
The CHP (under construction) will be provided with misting systems at
all transfer points, crusher and loading silo. All conveyors will be totally
enclosed. Along with this, dust extractors will also be installed. All pit
roads are regularly watered. Main haul roads are metalled and permanent ser-
vice roads are being paved. Greenbelts have been established around the colony
and along most of the service roads. As a result of these dust control mea-
sures, SPM levels regularly comply with air quality objectives except at tem-
porary loading arrangements where wagons are loaded by pay loaders.
Disturbed land reclamation
Since the mine was started in 1987, technical reclamation will start in
1995-96. Extensive tree planting will be done on the tops of external overbur-
den dumps.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
The concentration of industrial activities in the Singrauli area must
lead eventually to the need for regional approaches to environmental monitor-
ing management and land use planning.
Environmental management programes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluations
The existing air monitoring stations are considered adequate. For fre-
quency of air sampling, the samples are being drawn on 24 hourly basis for two
days in a month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At
present, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. Water quality stations are also consid-
ered adequate. Water levels and quality of wells/borewells will be monitored
quarterly in one of the villages adjacent to the mining operation. No change
to the noise monitoring programme is envisaged.
Hydrology and vater quality management

Current environmental status
-Environmental setting
The Ananta openast project is situated on a flat topography which slopes
gently towards north. Surface water flows in north-easterly direction and
drains into the Brahmani river, approximately 10km from mine boundary. Purunia
and Nakhetrapur villages fall at a distance of about 300m from mining bound-
ary. Hensmul village is situated 0.5km away from active mining area. Prior to
mining, the leasehold area of 810ha consisted of 9.9ha village land, 237.1ha
dry agriculture land, 195.5ha of degraded forest and shrub land used for graz-
ing and fuel wood production, 227.5ha of industrial area, 11.5ha water bodies
and 128.5ha unoccupied land.
Baseline data
The baseline environmental quality data was generated in 1987-88. Air
sampling stations were located inside core zone, at Ekada Village and
Karanpura Village. SPM, NO., SO2 and dust fall rates were below permissible
limit of CPCB standards. Water samples were collected from pond in Her.smul
village, Nandira Jhara near Parang village, pond at Barajorda, pond at Balanda



- 146 -
Village, Bangaru Jhara on upstream of confluence with Katri Jhara, Bangaru
Jhara on downstream of latri Jhara and Katri Jhara near mine area. All these             b
water were not fit for drinking purpose. Noise level measurements were con-
ducted at the proposed mine area, proposed colony site, adjoining Bharatpur
mine area, rehabilitation zone and infrastructural area. Noise levels in the
proposed mine area and infrastructural area were within threshold limits 85-90
dB(A), but some readings in the proposed colony site and rehabilitation site
were slightly higher.
Mine planning and design
Ananta block is predominantly soil covered and gently undulating, form-
ing paddy fields. As with most new Indian surface coal mines, the Ananta
project is designed for maximum backfill. Initial surface cut and external
overburden dumps were undertaken from November 1988 to March 1989 entirely by
truck/shovel operation. In 1991, pit backfilling commenced. Dump materials
consist of pebbles, rocks, weathered sardstone and sandy silts. coal is won by
conventional drilling and blasting. Total coal is currently transported by
truck up to a distance of about 3km to the railway siding for loading. Areas
of leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of current five year pe-
riod (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to total 32 years mine life are as
follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring has been carried out since the post-monsoon
season of 1991. Air quality readings are taken at a sub-station (llKV) adja-
cent to main haul road, Dera U.P. School, Rensmul U.P. School and Pump House
near the mine face. Water quality survey stations include mine pump discharge
point at the western boundary of the mine, earth drain collecting run-off
water from external dumps, earth drain collecting run-off from internal dumps
downstream of Bangaru nallah, discharge point from dozer washing shed, dug
well at Hensmul village and supply-tap at project office. Noise readings are
taken near pit site office, CEP and maintenance office inside the mine and
Hensmul new settlement. Monitoring stations and the frequency will be
reorganised after the notification of CPCB guidelines.



- 147 -
Hydrology and water quality manageJmant
Water discharge from the industrial site is collected in two old mining
voids in sequence. Positive discharge occurs only during the peak of the mon-
soon season. A length of 0.8km garland drain has been constructed on each side
of the main haul road. Garland drains have not been constructed to control and
treat run-off from the external dumps. CHP, workshop and vehicle washing areas
have no waste effluent treatment facility.
Air quality and noise management
SPM levels in a sensitive zone such as the pump house inside the quarry,
sub-station and readings taken by the side of the haulroad have been found
exceeding prescribed limits by CPCB. At Hensmul U.P. School, air quality data
are within standards in all seasons. The road leading to the railway siding
and railway siding site are sources of dust and spot measurements indicate
that SPN levels exceed the prescribed limits. Air quality at the project of-
fice and village site is regularly in compliance with appropriate standards in
all seasons. At present 80 automatic water sprinklers mounted on 0.8km water
supply network are spraying water on generated dust around the CHP. Two water
tankers are engaged continuously along haul roads for water spraying in two
shifts. Noise levels are studied day and night and are within CPCB limits at
all stations. Workers have been provided ear-defenders to work in noise con-
centration zones. About 2.8km of avenue plantation has been carried out to
reduce impacts of air and noise pollution.
Disturbed land reclamation
At present the total external dump area is 14.44ha. Some external dumps
will also be formed at a later stage. External dumps have outer slopes of 350-
380 and heights varying from 20-30m. 2.1 million m3 of external overburden and
13.1 million m3 of internal overburden dumping have been completed so far.
Internal overburden dumps extend over an area of 26.5ha. over 32,000 trees
have been planted over 5.6ha of external dump areas, including 3.8ha of top-
soil dump. The survival rate along dump slopes has been very poor. Leguminous
grass has been planted along the slopes of dormant internal dumps.
Environmental management programmes 1995-1996 to 1999-2000
Project monitoringr, auditing and evaluation
Three new air quality monitoring stations will be established by quarter
ending June 1995 at the ClP, Hensmul village and railway siding. Present pro-
cedures for monitoring will continue for new stations. Water quality sampling
stations will be increased to include tap water at the colony site. Two set-



- 148 -
tling ponds will be constructed at the western boundary and at the north of
the external overburden dump to control and treat run-off water from internal
dumps and external dumps respectively. Four other sampling stations will be
established to monitor water quality at the discharge point of each settling
pond and upstream and downstream side of the seasonal nallah flowing along the
western edge of the mine. Quarterly data on quality and water level will be
taken from at least one dug well of Hensmul village. The current noise moni-
toring programme will continue. One environmental laboratory will be estab-
lished by 1996-97 at Talcher coalfield to serve all existing and proposed coal
projects with the purpose of (i) generating data on baseline environmental
quality, (ii) monitoring environmental quality to adopt suitable remedial
measures, (iii) generating necessary environmental quality data for developing
models for prediction of pollution, and (iv) monitoring the condition of coal
stocks to prevent spontaneous heating.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 2.4km of garland drain will be constructed by the end of
1996 to collect surface run-off from outer slopes of external overburden dumps
and near the 33KV sub-station. Run-off from HEMM and vehicle washing areas
will be passed through an industrial effluent treatment plant by end of 1996.
Oil and grease traps will be established by December 1996.
Alir quality and noise managenent
A length of about 1.2km of haul road connecting the mine entry point and
time office will be blacktopped during 1996-97. water tankers will be engaged
for all shifts. 1.5km of a water supply network with automatic water sprin-
klers mounted on it will be installed around the CHP to improve upon the air
quality by December 1996. Results will be monitored carefully and if improve-
ment is not sufficient, chemical retardants will be contemplated during 1997-
98. Three additional noise monitoring stations will be established near the
workshop, Eensmul village and the colony area. 5.6km of plantation will be
done around the workshop, CEP, each side of the balance road length encircling
the industrial site and each side of the approach road to the colony.
Disturbed land reclamation
As the old external dumps are steep, an engineering study will be car-
ried out to study the critical slope angle and length relationship for range
of spoil types by December 1996. If necessary, the old dumps will be modified
in accordance with study recommendations. The slope of future external dumps
will be maintained at 28°. MEEM to be used in physical reclamation will be
commissioned by 1996-97. Further, 28ha backfilled area will be available for
reclamation during 1995-96 and 1996-97 and this will be reclaimed at a rate
8ha, 10ha and 10ha during 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2D00 respectively.

Max. quarry depth:    67m
Coal destination:    Captive power plants of Bhilai, Rourkela
and western India TPS
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Belpahar project is situated on a flat to moderately undulating
plain, gently sloping towards the east.The drainage of the area is controlled
by Lilari nallah, which joins Ib River about 4km away. Out of a total project
area of 1601ha, the premining land use was 277.3ha of forest land, 518.Oha of
agricultural land, 20.7ha home site and the rest was unoccupied.
Baseline data
Comprehensive baseline monitoring data had been generated for the
project in 1989-90 for four seasons. The six air sampling stations were estab-
lished at villages in the buffer zone, proposed resettlement sites, workshop
and colony. SPM levels recorded varied from as low as 21pg/m3 during monsoon
to 50lpg/m3 during pre-monsoon period, against permissible CPCB standards of
200Lg/m3 (residential and rural) and 500zpg/3 (for industrial and mixed use).
S02 and No, were well within permissible limits. Water sampling points (6 no.)
included a tubewell in Belpahar township, Lilari nallah, a pond in Chharla and
Jorabaga village and lb river. Water was generally not found fit for drinking
except that from the tubewell. Noise monitoring was conducted at seven sta-



- 154 -
tions which included the workshop, township, CHP and the resettlement sites.
Except for a few readings, noise levels were within permissible limits.
Nine plafmiing and design
The mine is worked by dragline and shovel/dumper combinations. Nine
external overburden dumps exist. Internal back filling started in 1989 and 16
million m3 of overburden has been backfilled. Out of total pit area of
431.8ha, SOha in the end will be developed as a water body and the rest will
be reclaimed and afforested. Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facili-
ties to the end of this five year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and to the end
of mine life are given below:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring is carried out during all seasons. Air quality
readings are taken at the workshop and colony. Water sampling and analysis is
being done for mine discharge water, a tube well in the township, village pond
is Jorabaga and in water courses. Noise level monitoring is being done at the
project office, residential colony, workshop and CEP. Readings are within
permissible limits.
Hydrology and water quality management
Pit water accumulates in pit sump where the bulk of suspended matter
settles. Pit water after settling is used for industrial purposes, such as
dust suppression and fire fighting. During dry months pit water does not dis-
charge into surface watercourses. During monsoon, pit water is pumped out and
channeled to settling tanks on the surface. Industrial effluents from the
workshop, after passing through grease and oil traps, also discharge into the
settling tank. The overflow from the settling tank flows into surface water-
courses. The mine discharge water is generally within permissible limits.
However, the water from the ponds and nallah are not fit for drinking purposes
due to contamination from seepage/inflows from areas which are under intensive
domestic and industrial use.



- 1S5 -
Air quality and noise management
At the workshop the SPM is found to be within permissible limits (500g/
m'), but in the colony the permissible limit (200Igg/m) is occasionally ex-
ceeded. All service roads and coal transport roads to the siding are black-
topped. These inpit haul roads and other dust generating locations are regu-
larly sprinkled with water. Tree planting has been carried out against the
mine area, CHP and coal transport roads to protect the colony and other work
sites from dust and noise. Air samples from working areas indicate SPI levels
in excess of permissible limits (500mg/m3). In the rest of the locations SPM
is generally within limits. Noise readings are also within permissible limits,
except in some readings.
Disturbed land reclamation
Nine external dumps have been formed varying in height from 8- 25m and
quantity varying from 0.6 to 3.3 million m3. The tops of overburden dumps,
both external and (partly) internal have been extensively planted with a good
mixture of indigenous and exotic trees. On the slopes however, the plantation
is poor.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
one additional air sampling station in Chharla village is to be added.
Water level and quality monitoring stations will include at least one well in
Chharla village during 1995-96. The number of noise monitoring stations is
found to be adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
one additional settling tank will be constructed for treating pit/indus-
trial waste water by April 1996. A crarland drain around overburden and coal
dumps and also for linking all water to settling tanks is to be completed
before 1996 monsoon. The adequacy of the treatment of sewage from the colony
area will be studied before the 1996 monsoon.
Air quality and noise management
The haul road inside the pit will be blacktopped. Automatic water sprin-
klers are planned for more effective dust suppression. Block planting and
avenue planting is to be carried out.



- 156 -
Dlsturbed land reclamation
In future all physical land reclamation is to have a slope of less than
28'. For old external overburden dumps an engineering study is to be conducted
and completed by December 1996 to determine a safe slope angle. If the study
establishes a slope angle of more than 280 to be stable, relaxation for such
steeper angle will be requested from MOEF. After the engineering study and
relaxation from MOEF, resloping of the old dumps to the recommended slope
angle will be commenced and completed in phases by 1999-2000. An area of ap-
proximately 15ha area will be available from backfilling for reclamation in
each year.

BHARATPUR
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine:    Bharatpur
Company:    MCL
State:    Orissa
Coalfield:    Talcher
Year of sanction:    1983
Operational startup:    1985
Type of mine:    Opencast
Mining method:    Truck & shovel
Current production:    3.5 million tonnes
Capaicity:    5.0 million tonnes
Mine life:    50 years
Residual life:    30 years
Number of coal seams:    3 (Thickness: 25-35m)
Ash content:    35-42%
Strip ratio:    0.8:1
Nax. quarry depth:    130m
Coal destination:    Captive power plant of Nalco and proposed
power station at Vishakhapatnam
Current environmental status
Environmental settingr
The Bharatpur opencast mine is situated on a flat plain which slopes
gently towards the north. Surface water of the area drains into the Brahmani
river which flows at a distance of 12.5km on the east side. Prior to mining,
the leasehold area of 1237.2ha constituted about 258ha of natural forest and
degraded forest. 895.2ha of dry agriculture and rained paddy fields and water
bodies and 34ha of small villages. The remaining 50ha was industrial and water
bodies.
Baseline data
Comprehensive baseline monitoring data was generated for this project in
1988-89. Air quality data was collected for all four seasons at the minesite,
Jadunathpur village and at a school on the road to the thermal power station.
Spot sampling during the winter season took place on four other stations.
Water quality samples were taken from a local well and a nallah. Noise read-
ings were taken within the proposed minesite, workshop and colony areas and
near the regional hospital. All baseline information was within ambient objec-
tives.



- 160 -
Mine planning and design
This project will eventually be developed as two quarries though only
one is being worked at present. External dumps have very steep slopes, but
internal backfilled dumps have been well recontoured to blend into surrounding
landscapes. Two thirds of the pit area is expected to be backfilled, with the
remaining one third to become a water body. A village, Jambubahali, is located
very close to the edge of the quarry, within the safety zone. Backfilling
started in 1988. Total area covered by external dump is 36ha which resulted
from the initial truck and shovel operation. External dumps consist of mainly
morrum and weathered sandstone. The project is operated with shovel-dumper
combination. Coal production is currently transported by truck up to a dis-
tance of 2km to the crushing plant and then to NGR complex through covered
conveyor. Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the
current five year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total
50 years mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Operational monitoring informations has been collected since the post-
monsoon season of 1992. Air quality readings are taken at the minesite, the
coal handling plant, a local village (Nehru Satabdi Nagar) and a school on the
road to the thermal power station. All readings were within appropriate air
quality objectives. Water quality sampling is undertaken on the pit sump dis-
charge, a well in Jambubahali village and tap water in Nehru Satabdi Nagar.
There has been no real ambient water quality monitoring. Noise readings are
taken in the work zone, at the coal handling plant and at Nehru Satabdi Nagar.
With few exceptions, readings are regularly within noise level objectives.
Hydrology and water quality management
Pit water is collected in an in-pit settling pond controlled by a dam
and decant. The pit water is used for firefighting and dust suppression. Pit
water is discharged only at the peak of monsoon and flows via a drainage ditch
and two supplementary settling depressions to a nallah. A sewage water treat-
ment plant in Nehru Satabdi Nagar is in operation.



- 161 -
Air quality and noise management
Dust suppression in the CEP is good. Most service roads and long-term
haul roads are blacktopped and dirt haul roads are regularly watered using
three water tankers. About 100 continuous automatic water sprinklers are
mounted on 1.3km of water supply network for the coal stock pile area. About
5.0km of greenbelt has been established along haul roads, around the workshop
and CHP and inside Nehru Satabdi Nagar. Gas canisters are supplied to all
families in the colony to reduce smoke pollution.
Disturbed land reclamation
Out of 36ha external overburden dump area, 15ha of the top has been
extensively planted. This planting has employed a very diverse mixture of
exotic and indigenous tree species. However, slopes of these dumps are too
unstable to support plant growth. Recontouring has taken place on approxi-
mately 23ha of internal backfilled dumps and about 5ha of this area has been
planted.
Environmental management programmes 1995-1996 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Three new air quality stations, one in the new colony, one in
Jambubahali village and one between the existing school and the TPS, will be
added to the network by September 1995. Frequency of air monitoring and thus
annual costs, is presently uncertain pending the outcome of negotiations with
government authorities over new monitoring requirements. Water quality will be
monitored for all discharges from the minesite and in the receiving nallah
upstream and downstream of all effluent discharges. Well water levels and
quality will be monitored quarterly in two wells each in the Jambubahali and
Nehru Satabdi Nagar. Current noise monitoring will continue. Monitoring sta-
tions and frequency will be reorganised after the notification of CPCB guide-
lines. One environmental laboratory will be established at Talcher coalfield
to serve all existing mines by the end of 1996.
Hydrology and water quality management
Control and treatment of run-off, oil and grease from CEP and HEHM work-
shop will be established by December 1996. About 4.9km of garland drain system
around all overburden dumps linking settling ponds will be completed by June
1996. A scientific study to determine the adequacy of sewage disposal to
ground in the colony areas will be completed by June 1996.



- 162 -
Air quality and noise management
The present monitoring system is adequate. However, 13km of avenue plan-
tation will be carried out around CHP, CCT, colony and on both sides of the
approach road at a rate of 6.5km in 1996-97 and 1997-98. About 13km of barbed
wire fencing will be established around this plantation to protect the young
plants, at a rate of 6.5km in 1996-97 and 1997-98.
Disturbed land reclamation
The plant survival rate is poor on the slope of external overburden dumps, as
the angle is more than 350. An engineering study will be carried out to deter-
mine critical slope angle and length relationship for the range of spoil types
by December 1996. Out of 23ha of dormant internal dumps, the balance of 18ha
will be reclaimed: lOha in 1996-97 and Bha in 1997-98.
The balance of 21ha of external dumps of a total of 36ha, will be reclaimed as
per the result of aforesaid study.

JAGANNATH
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine:    Jagannath
Company:    MCL
State:    Orissa
Coalfield:    Talcher
Year of sanction:    1962
Operational startup:    1971
Type of mine:    opencast
Mining method:    Truck & shovel
Current production:    5.5 million tonnes
Capacity:    4.0 million tonnes
Mine life:    41 years
Residual life:    18 years
Number of coal seams:    2 (Thickness: 2.7-15.4m  1 1.4-46.8mi
Ash content:    34-43%
Strip ratio:    0.6:1
Max quarry depth:    50m
Coal destination:    Talcher TPS and south India power houses
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Jagannath Colliery area is predominantly soil covered and gently
undulating, forming paddy fields. The topography of the area is more or less
flat having northerly slope. The drainage of the area is controlled by the
Brahmani river on the eastern side, flowing about 8.5km from the mine. Prior
to mining, the leasehold area of 793.2ha consisted of 60.4ha forest land,
689.7ha dry agriculture land, 17.8ha village land, 2ha water bodies and 23.3ha
unoccupied land.
Baseline data
This is an old operating opencast mine. No MOEF approved ENP is in force
for the project, hence no baseline environmental quality survey was conducted.
However, an EMP has been formulated for implementation of environmental mea-
sures.
Mine planning and design
A shovel and dumper combination mining system is being practised. Con-
ventional drilling and blasting follow for coal winning. Total produced coal
is currently transported by truck about 1.8km to the railway siding for load-



- 166 -
ing. The total area of external dumps is 36.5ha. Presently all overburden is
used in backfilling. Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the
end of the current five year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and to the end of
anticipated 41 years mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring has been carried out on quarterly basis since
December 1993. Air quality readings are taken at the project office, CHP,
siding, working zone and coal stock yard. Water samples are taken from sta-
tions established at the workshop tap point (drinking), workshop discharge
point and mine discharge point. Noise readings are taken from mine face, work-
shop and CXP.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine discharge water is collected in the mine sump and then pumped out
to 8.Skm of garland drains along the quarry boundary. These drains open to two
settling ponds, one near the eastern boundary and the other along the western
boundary of the quarry. Sampling results indicate that the degree of pollution
in both mine water and industrial water is within the permissible limits.
Air quality and noise management
Levels of suspended particulate matter at all air monitoring stations
exceed maximum allowable standards prescribed by CPCB. Three water tankers are
engaged in dust suppression along the haul road and the road connecting the
siding with the mine. The noise levels measured at the workshop and CHP exceed
the CPCB standard both during day and night time. Ear defenders have been
provided to all industrial workers working near noise concentration zones.
Avenue planting over a length of 2.8km has already been established around the
CHP, railway siding and approach roads.



- 167 -
Disturbed land reclamation
Three external overburden dumps containing 12.9 million mn are spread
over 36.5ha. The height of dumps is between 20m and 25m and the slope angle
varies between 35 and 40t. The total area involved in backfilling is 49.Sha
accommodating a volume of about 24.8 million m' of overburden. Tree planting
has been completed on 52.5ha of external and internal dumps.
Environmental management programmes 1995-1996 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Two more water sampling stations at the discharge end of the settling
pond near the railway siding and at the discharge end of the embankment on the
north of Quarry No. 7 will be added during 1995-96. Six additional water sam-
pling stations will be established at dug/borewells of South Balanda, Dera,
Anantaberini, Lachhmanpur, Purunia and Nakhatrapur to monitor water quality
and water by the quarter ending September 1995. Monitoring stations and fre-
quency will be reorganised after the notification of CPCB guidelines for the
coal industry. One environmental laboratory will be established at Talcher
coalfield to (i) generate baseline environmental quality data, (ii) monitor
environmental quality in order to adopt suitable remedial measures, (iii)
generate necessary environmental quality data models for prediction of pollu-
tion, and (iv) monitor coal stock to prevent spontaneous heating by end of
1996.
Hydrology and water quality management
An industrial water treatment plant will be constructed to treat waste
water frw' workshop shed by December 1995. Runoff from CHP, HEMN and vehicle
washing area will be conveyed to plant after initial treatment to remove
grease and oil. An oil and grease trap will be constructed inside plant by
June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
The present water spraying arrangement at dust generation points is not
sufficient. Provision of an additional 2km of water supply network, with
sprinklers/misters mounted on it, will be installed by December 1996. To re-
duce impacts of air and noise polluition, avenue planting over 1.5km will be
established by December 1996 along both sides of the haul road and CUP site.



- 168 -
Disturbed land reclamation
The slope angle of external overburden dumps varies between 35° and 40°
with heights of 20-25m. An engineering study will be conducted by December
1996 to establish slope angle and length relationships. Out of total 49.5ha of
backfilled area, a dormant area of 37.5ha will be reclaimed biologically by
1996-97, lOha in 1997-98, lOha in 1998-99 and 7.5ha in 1999-2000.

Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The general configuration of the area is plain, generally sloping to-
wards the east and draining into the Ib River about 5km from the project
through Lilari nallah. Premining land uses of 1413.8ha of project area were
233.4ha forest land, 551.5ha unoccupied waste land, 617.7ha dry agricultural
land and 11.2ha homesites. The villages of Khairkuni, Banjipali and Tingismal
are within the core zone.
Baseline data
Comprehensive premining baseline data for all four seasons has been
generated. Air samples were drawn from five stations which included Sardamal
village and the proposed colony area for Lakhanpur mine. SPM values in sta-
tions were higher than CPCB standards. Water samples were collected from nine
locations including tubewells/dugwells/ponds in villages Khairkuni, Banji-
palli, Ubuda, Kusuraloi, and Kirarama in the core zone and buffer =one.
Samples from Lilari nallah were also taken. It is unfit for drinking in gen-
eral. Noise levels were recorded at six stations including the market place,
the proposed colony and infrastructure areas in the core zone and also in the
buffer zone. In general, noise levels varied between 30 and 70dB(A) but, near
the market place, a few values were higher than 90dB(A). In the buffer zone of

the mine site several coal mines, a refractory factory and a paper mill are in
operation.
Nine planing and design
The project will eventually develop into five quarries. The mine is
planned to work with shovel/dumper combination. Quarry No. 1 is being worked
at present. External dumps, in places, have slopes exceeding 280. Internal
backfilling has not started. Out of a total 470.1ha of land which will be
disturbed due to mining, 351.5ha will be back filled and reclaimed and 36.25ha
will be developed as a water pool. Uses of the project area for different
purposes to the end of current five year period (1   -96 to 1999-2000) plan
and anticipated at the end of mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring information has been done since 1993. Monitor-
ing stations exist at wells/por-ds in nearby villages for the regular effective
monitoring of water levels and quality. Samples are taken from wells of nearby
villages Khairkuni and Banjhipali. Air and noise measurement data are within
permissible limits, whereas water does not generally meet the standard, espe-
cially in TSS.
Hydrology and vater quality management
Pit water is initially lodged in a pit sump to allow the settling of
suspended matter. This water, after pumping, is used for various industrial
purposes, such as dust suppression. During the monsoon, excess water from the
pit sump is pumped out and channeled through natural depressions to the nearby
Phuljhar nallah. A grease and oil trap for workshop effluent and a well-
designed, compartmented settling tank is being constructed.
Air quality and noise management
Air quality is being monitored at the project office in the core zone,
in nearby Girintola village in the buffer zone and constructed colony area and



- 173 -
in the buffer zone. At the project office SPM level is within permissible
limits whereas at two other stations SPM level occasionally goes above permis-
sible limits. Noise is being recorded within the mine area and at the reha-
bilitation site and CHP. Noise levels are found within permissible limits.
Dust suppression in and around the CHP, haul roads and work places needs im-
provement. Planting has been done to act as barriers against coal transporta-
tion roads.
Disturbed land reclamation
All overburden produced has been placed in an external dump with two
benches. The lower bench has a height of 15m and the upper one 10m. It occu-
pies some Sha. Regrading the slopes of this dump to 280 is in progress. Back
filling of the pit has not started, but is planned to start from 1995-96.
Biological reclamation of the external dump is in progress.
Environmental management prograkmes 1995-1996 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The air monitoring points cover the important zones, thus no additional
air monitoring stations are called for. Water quality and level monitoring
stations will be added in one borevell/well/pond in Ghanmal village, nearest
to the present working in 1995-96. Noise monitoring is also considered suffi-
cient. monitoring stations and the frequency will be reorganised after the
notification of CPCB guidelines for the coal industry.
Hydrology and water quality management
The grease and oil trap is under construction for workshop effluent and
a masonry settling tank is also under construction for treating other indus-
trial water. The industrial effluent treatment arrangement will be completed
and commissioned by December 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Workshop, office complex, other industrial activity zones outside mine
area, villages and colonies are to be effectively isolated from heavy traffic
roads, mine and CHP by thick greenbelts which minimise dust and noise in these
areas. It is planned to blacktop haul roads and provide automatic sprinklers
for effective dust suppression in CEP, haul roads and coal stock piles. These
measures will keep dust level in ambient air within stipulated standards.



- 174 -
Dlsturbed land reclamation
Dumps created in the future will have slopes of less than 280. For ex-
isting dumps, an engineering study for slope stability will be carried out by
December 1996 and relaxation for the stable slope angle in excess of 28', if
established, shall be obtained from competent authority. After the results of
the study, if needed, the existing overburden dumps will be resloped. The
current dormant disturbed area is 12ha of unreclaimed overburden dumps.

Max. quarry depth:    69m
Coal destination:    Western India power houses
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The topography of Samleswari mine is generally flat, gently sloping
towards the south and southwest. Drainage of the area is controlled by
Pondraine nallah in the southwest, which discharges into Lilari nallah in the
south. Lilari nallah, in turn, joins the Ib river about 5km from the mine
boundary. Out of a total 906.4ha of leasehold area, 348.5ha was forest land,
.237.7ha unoccupied waste land and the rest cultivated land and settlements.
Villages Lajkura, Kudopali and Ora.npara are situated about 0.6-0.7km from the
rise-side boundary of the pit area. Mining is progressing away from these
villages and the active mining area is at present more than lan from the vil-
lages. The project site has coal mines, a paper mill and a refractory factory
in nearby localities.
Baseline data
Comprehensive baseline monitoring data was generated by engaging three
agencies in 1987-88. Air quality data was collected from five stations in both
the core and buffer zones, which included Sardamal village. Air samples were
collected for all four seasons. SPM values were observed to be higher than
CPCB standards in two stations, including Sardamal village. So2 and NO, were
found to be well below CPCB permissible limits. Water samples were taken from



- 178 -
eight locations including ponds/wells in nearby villages (Lajkura, Kudopali),
Lilari nallah and Ib river. Samples for all four seasons were collected. All
samples in the monsoon period indicate high BOD, high fluoride and low D.O.
and are unfit for human consumption. In well samples, parameters are within
permissible limits and the water is fit for drinking purposes. Noise levels
were measured at six stations at the core zone, proposed colony(2), Laikura
mine, proposed rehabilitation site, proposed CHP site and near the market
place. Noise levels near Lajkura mine exceeded the threshold limit.
Mine planning and desfign
The mine is planned for dragline and shovel-dumper operation. Coal is
transported to railway siding by truck. Though the backfilling has started,
the formation of external overburden dumps will continue till 2000. out of a
total pit area of 285ha, 165.5ha is planned to be backfilled and 38.7ha is
proposed to be finally developed as water pool. The rest will remain as a dip
side slope. Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of
the current 5 year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total
23 year mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaludtion
Environmental monitoring has been carried out since 1993. Air quality
readings are taken adjacent to the project office, colony area and buffer
zone. Water quality stations are at the mine discharge point, a pond of
Kudopali village, and the confluence of Lilari nallah and Ib river. Noise
levels reading are taken in the CHP area, proposed colony area, workplace and
market place.
Hydrology and water quality management
Pit water first accumulates in a pit sump. During the monsoon, water
from the pit sump is pumped out and then allowed to pass through a series of
natural settling ponds before final discharge to nallah. Garland drains exist
around the quarry. Around external overburden and coal dumps, drains are re-



- 179 -
quired. The water quality is within permissible limits except for the presence
of coliforms.
Air quality and noise management
The coal transport road from the mine to rail siding is black topped,
except for about lkm near the siding. Dust conditions near the railway cross-
ing and in the siding need improvement. The main source of dust is coal spill-
age from trucks.
Disturbed land reclamation
During the initial two years, overburden was removed by shovel-dumper
and external overburden dumps in a 15ha area were created. These dumps have
slopes varying from 260-350. In 1992 a dragline was commissioned and external
overburden dumps were created by it in a 5ha area with slopes around 450. The
height of external overburden dumps varies from B-30m. Old external overburden
dumps have been biologically reclaimed. Recent external dumps and internal
backfilling are being physically reclaimed and prepared for biological recla-
mation. Trees have been planted in the old external overburden dumps with
excellent survival. Dense planting in these dumps exists both at dump tops and
also on slopes. Planting has not been done in newly created external dumps and
in backfilled areas.
Environmental management programmes 1995-1996 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Three new air monitoring stations will be added to the network, one in
Kudopali village, one near the railway crossing in Gopi vihar colony and one
in the siding. Water quality will be monitored from the final discharge of
mine vater, after the settling tank, before this discharge joins the nallah
and also at Lilari nallah before it joins lb river. Water level and quality in
one dugwell/ borehole each in Kudopali and Lajkura village will be monitorect..
A noise station will be added in Gopi vihar. Monitoring stations and the fre-
quency of monitoring will be reorganised after the notification of CPCB guide-
lines for the coal industry.
Hydrology and water quality management
About 2km of garland drain will be constructed before June 1996 around
external overburden and coal dumps. Runoff from the CHP, REMN and vehicle
was%ing areas will be treated initially with oil and grease traps. A masonry
settling tank will be constructed in 1995-96.



- 180 -
Air quality and nolse management
Two new water tankers will be acquired in 1995-96 for dust suppression
on haul roads and in pit and plant areas. An automatic water sprinkler system
will be installed during 1995-96 and 1996-97 at the CHP, weigh bridge and
railway siding. After monitoring the result,s the system will be further
strengthened by additional sprinklers and the use of chemical retardants dur-
ing 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
Disturbed land reclamation
The tops of external overburden dump tops have excellent plantations;
only about 15% of slope areas will need regrading if found unstable. Some of
the overburden is now being used in backfilling. Back filled areas will be
regularly reclaimed as per approved EMP stipulations. For all external over-
burden dumps, an engineering study for stable slope angles will be carried out
by December 1996 and unstable slopes, if any, will be resloped in a phased
manner.

Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Durgapur mine is situated on moderately plain terrain in Chandrapur
district of Maharashtra State. Worker colonies are concentrated between the
minesite and Chandrapur TPS. In addition, one long-established village
(Durgapur) is located about 1.5 to 2km from the mine to the north and north-
east of the mine area. Prior to mining, the leasehold area of 821.Oha con-
sisted of 422.5ha of dry agricultural land, 273.9ha of degraded forest and
124.6ha barren government land.
Baseline data
Baseline information was not needed in 1978-81. However, an environmen-
tal quality assessment was done in 1988. Air quality stations were at Durgapur
colony, Sumitra nagar and Sinhala village. Water samples were taken at the
colony and upstream and downstream of Motaghat nallah. Noise levels were mea-
sured at the colony, project office, workshop and CHP. SPM levels were found
to be well within permissible limit at all air stations. High TSS was found in
water samples taken from Motaghat nallah. other than in the workshop and CHP,
noise levels were within the threshold limit.



- 184 -
Mine planning and design
Durgapur project is an ongoing project sanctioned by the Government of
India in October 1978 for a target capacity of 1.8 million tonnes per year.
There is only one thick composite coal seam (thickness range 14-17m) being
worked by opencast mining. Top soil and weathered rock is removed by hydraulic
shovels (3.8m3) and dumpers (35 tonne). Hard overburden is removed by rope
shovels (5.0 in) and dumpers (50 tonne). Coal and in-seam partings are removed
by shovels (4.6-5 m3) and dumpers (35 tonne) unloading the coal into the inpit
feeder breaker conveyor system connected to the ClP. Conventional drilling and
blasting is adopted for breaking overburden and coal. Coal production is cur-
rently hauled by conveyor to the Thermal Power Station. Current overburden
production will be used mainly for backfilling the quarry voids and a small
portion for dumping in external overburden dumps. The total area of external
dumps will be 107.2ha. Dump material consists of mixture of sandstone and
friable sandy silts. The area occupied by mine facilities to the end of the
current five years and anticipated total 22 year life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started from the monsoon season of 1992.
However, it was discontinued and has again been started from January 1995. Air
quality readings are taken near the sub area manager's office, at Durgapur
village and in the worker's colony. Water quality monitoring stations are at
the mine sump, Motaghat nallah upstream and downstream. Noise readings are
taken during day and night at the workshop, quarry and colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a decoaled area in the pit. The water is then
pumped out for various industrial and miscellaneous uses. Additional discharge
from the sump is collected in large pond from where discharge occurs only
during the peak of monsoon season and has regularly been in compliance with
Government of India discharge standa-rds. Garland drains and settling ponds are
yet to be constructed to control and treat run-off from the external overbur-
den dumps. The workshop and vehicle maintenance shops have as yet no waste
water treatment facilities.



- 185 -
Air quality and noise management
Air quality monitoring is conducted near the quarry working area, office
and worker/residential colonies and is in regular compliance with the appro-
priate standards in all seasons except pre-monsoon season, when some excur-
sions do occur. Significant air pollution appears to be from CTPS which is
upwind from the mine. Day time and night time noise levels around the HEMS
workshop occasionally exceed the limits for industrial areas. Noise levels in
the quarry, CHP and colony area are regularly in compliance with standards.
Regional environmental status
The level of operations and the pollutants generated from this mine are
not likely to affect the regional air or water quality to any appreciable
extent.
Disturbed land reclamation
Existing external dumps have outer slopes of 30° to 40° and heights vary-
ing from 10 to 40m. Planting on external overburden dumps has already been
started in collaboration with National Environmental Engineering and Research
Institute (NEERI) Nagpur. R&D studies using industrial organic waste and spe-
cially developed bio-culture have shown excellent results on some of the bar-
ren overburden dumps of more than 300 slope.
Environmental management programes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Three existing air quality monitoring stations will be relocated in
1995: one at the quarry near Singhla village, one at the residential colony
and the third one between CTPS and the residential colony. For frequency of
air sampling, the samples will be drawn on a 24 hourly basis for two days in a
month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At present, CPCB
is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be complied with
after its notification. Three existing water quality sampling stations will
continue. Quarterly samples of water quality and water level will be started
at one domestic well in Singhala village. Water samples are proposed to be
taken regularly in the well/tubewell in the residential colony to assess the
impact of sewage treatment facilities. The three existing noise monitoring
stations will continue.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 8.5km of garland drains will be constructed by December
1996 to collect runoff from the slopes of the external overburden dumps and



- 186 -
convey it to a proposed settling pond. Waste water from the CHP, HEMM and
vehicle maintenance shop will also be conveyed to this new settling pond,
after initial treatment to remove grease and oil, which will be completed by
December 1996. This settling pond will be designed to have no positive dis-
charge except during the peak of monsoon season when it will have a minimum of
24 hours settling time. Studies to determine the adequacy of sewage disposal
system on ground water will be completed by June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Two water tankers are in operation to reduce the level of dust in and
around areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements are
insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in specific work-
ing areas will be contemplated in fiscal year 1997-98. Periodic noise problems
in the HEMN workshop will be dealt with by providing hearing protection to
exposed workers. The company will request the authorities of Chadrapur super
thermal plant to enforce more effective particulate suppression in CTPS. How-
ever, WCL will participate in the regional air quality management programme as
and when it starts.
Disturbed land reclamation
There is a backlog of 28ha disturbed land due to external overburden
dumps. As this is an ongoing project, an EMP has not been formulated for
clearance from MOEF. However, an engineering study is proposed to be conducted
during 1995-96 and 1996-97 for slope stability of these overburden dumps.
Depending on the outcome of the study, these dumps will be resloped to stable
angles, if necessary, by rehandling of overburden. Otherwise, if found stable,
these areas will be developed by biological reclamation of 7ha in 1997-98 and
12ha each in 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Reclamation of currently disturbed land
will be under taken at the rate of 20.8ha per year with effect from 1995-96.

Operational startup:    1991
Year of Env clearance:    1987
Type of mine:    Opencast
Mining method:    Truck & shovel
Current production:    1.9 million tonnes
Capacity:    1.9 million tonnes
Mine life:    30 years
Residual life:    27 years
Number of coal seams:    1 (Thickness: 14-1Bm)
Ash content:    23.9-27.1%

Max. quarry depth:   l1Om
Coal destination:    MSEB's Chandrapur TPS (CTPS) and local
industrial consumers
Current environmental status
Enviroznmental setting
The Niljai mine is situated on a moderately undulated terrain in the
Yeotmal district Maharashtra. The major part of the area is below HFL. Resi-
dential colonies are situated away from the minesite. Prior to mining, the
leasehold area of 1147.8ha consisted 1079.8ha of dry land agriculture and 68ha
of Government barren land. No forest land is involved in this project.
Baseline data
Baseline data was not generated in 1987. However, environmental quality
information was collected in 1989-90. The data indicates that SPM levels at
Niljai village had been exceeded in the winter season. Water quality in all
the sampling stations was found to be within prescribed limits. Noise levels
at all stations conformed to the standards.
Mine planning and design
There is only one composite seam being worked by opencast mining. Top
soil and weathered rock is removed by hydraulic shovels and dumpers (35



- 190 -
tonne). Hard overburden is removed by rope shovels and dumpers. Coal and in-
seam parting is removed by hydraulic shovels and dumpers. Conventional drill-
ing and blasting is adopted for breaking overburden and coal. Current overbur-
den production will be used for backfilling the quarry void and dumping on
external overburden dumps which will continue until the end of project. Coal
production is currently hauled by trucks to Ghugus railway siding, frcm where
the coal is transported to CTPS of MSEB. The area of external overburden dumps
for the project will be 307.8ha (including 102.8ha from embankment). Dump
materials consist of a mixture of sandstone and friable sandy silts. Areas of
the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total residual life of 13
years are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started with effect from the monsoon season
of 1992. However, it was discontinued and started again in January 1995. Air
quality readings are taken adjacent to the quarry, at the Niljai Village and
in the worker residential colony. Water quality stations are the mine sump, a
seasonal nallah upstream and downstream and a well in Niljai village. Noise
readings are taken day and night at the quarry, CHP and colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a decoaled area in the mine pit from where
the water is pumped out for various industrial and miscellaneous purposes.
Positive discharge from the final pit sump occurs only during the peak of
monsoon season and has been in compliance with Government of India discharge
standards. Garland drains and settling ponds have not yet been constructed to
control and treat runoff from the external overburden dumps. The workshop and
vehicle washing areas do not have oil and grease trap facilities as yet.
Air quality and noise management
1.ir quality monitored at all three stations is in compliance with the
appropriate standards in all seasons except in pre-monsoon, when periodic



- 191 -
excursions occur. Day time and night time noise levels in the quarry, CHP and
colony area are in compliance with standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
The existing overburden dumps, covering an area of about 20ha, have 280
slopes and will be maintained at the same angle. Tree plantation activities
have been taken up on external overburden dumps with good survival rates.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Three air quality monitoring stations have been reorganised in the
project network in 1995 at the following sites: the Niljai village, near
Belsani village and near the project office. These air monitoring stations
appear to serve the required purpose. For frequency of air sampling, the
samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for two days in a month or two days
in a quarter depending on pollution load. Meanwhile CPCB is formulating stan-
dards for the coal industry which will be complied with after its notifica-
tion. Four water quality sampling stations will continue. Quarterly samples of
water quality and water level will be taken at one domestic well near the
colony to assess the impacts of sewage treatment facilities. The noise moni-
toring station already fixed will continue.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 6km of garland drains will be constructed by December 1996
to collect runoff from the outer slopes of the external overburden dumps and
convey it to a proposed settling pond. Runoff from the CHP, HEMK and vehicle
washing area will also be conveyed to this new settling pond (which will be
completed by December 1996) after initial treatment to remove grease and oil.
This settling pond will be designed to have no positive discharge except dur-
ing the peak of the monsoon season when it will have a minimum retention time
of 24 hours. Studies to determine the adequacy of the existing sewage disposal
system will be completed by June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Two water tankers are in operation to reduce the level of dust in and
around mine areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements are
insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in specific work-
ing areas will be contemplated in fiscal year 1997-98. If a noise problem is
diagnosed in the HEMM workshop, suitable action will be taken to bring it
within standards.



- 192 -
Disturbed land reclamation
All the overburden dumps in this project are active dumps. There is no
backlog of disturbed area due to external overburden dumps. These areas will
be taken up for biological reclamation at the rate of 60ha per year starting
from 1995-96 at an average cost per ha of Rs2O,OOO for grass and legume seed-
ing, and Rs62,500 for tree planting. The annual reclamation costs will be Rs5
million every year for five years.

PADMAPUR
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Nine:    Padmapur
Company:    WCL
State:    Maharashtra
Coalfield:    Wardha valley
Year of sanction:    1984
Operational startup:    1985
Type of mine:    Opencast
Mining method:    Truck a shovel
Current production :   1.1'. million tonnes
Capacity:    1.25 million tonnes
Mine life:    38 years
Residual life:    29 years
Number of coal seams:    1 (Thickness: 17-23m)
Ash content:    26-35%
Strip ratio:    4:1
Max. quarry depth:    115m
Coal destination:    Chandrapur TPS (CTPS)
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Padmapur mine is situated on a flat plain. Worker residential colo-
nies are concentrated on the southern side 2km away from the minesite. In
addition, two villages (Mingaon and Padmapur) are located to the vest and
north of the mine area but outside the leasehold of the project, each approxi-
mately 1-2km from the active mining area. Prior to mining, the leasehold area
of 557.3ha consisted of 20.8ha village land, 529.5ha of dryland agriculture,
and 7ha of Government barren land. Padmapur is adjacent to Durgapur mine and
is about 8km away from Chandrapur Thermal Power Station.
Baseline data
-              Mine operation was started in 1984 when baseline data vas not required.
However, for EMP formulation in 1989, an environment quality assessment was
done. It indicated that air quality at all the four stations were within the
-        prescribed limits. Water quality at Motaghat nallah was within the prescribed
standards, except TSS. Noise levels were within threshold limits.
Mine pla-ning and design
The seam is split into three sections (top, middle and bottom) by 2m
thick stone bands. The top 10-12m of soil/subsoil is removed by scrapers and



- 196 -
dozerE blth ripper attachments. Overburden below the soil/subsoil layer is
being drilled, blasted and excavated by 4.6/5m3 electric rope shovels from lOm
high benches and transported by 35 tonne rear dumpers. Bench heights in the
coal seam are limited to 6m to facilitate deployment of hydraulic shovels/
backhoes of 1.5-2m capacity. Non-coal bands within the coal seam are removed
separately by hydraulic shovels/backhoes of 1.5-2m' capacity. Coal production
is currently hauled by belt conveyors to the CHP installed on the top surface
and then to CTPC by conveyor. Present overburden production will be used for
backfilling the quarry voids and part will go to external overburden dumps.
Due to the steepness of the coal seam, part of the overburden will have to be
dumped externally. The total area of external dumps of the project will be
117.7ha. Dump materials consist of a mixture of sandstone and friable sandy
silts. Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the
current five year period and anticipated to the total residual life of the
mine (13 years) are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring has been undertaken since the monsoon season of
1992. However, it was discontinued and started again in January 1995. Air
quality readings are taken adjacent to the sub area manager's office, at
Padmapur village and in the worker colony. Water quality stations are the mine
sump and Notaghat nallah upstream and downstream. Noise readings are taken day
and night at the workshop, quarry and colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a decoaled area in the pit. The water is then
pumped out for various industrial and miscellaneous uses. Additional discharge
from the decoaled sump is collected in a large pond from which positive dis-
charge occurs only during the peak of monsoon season and has regularly been in
compliance with Government of India discharge standards. Garland drains and
settling ponds have not yet been constructed to control and treat runoff from
the external overburden dumps. The workshop and vehicle washing areas have as
yet no waste water treatment facilities. A series of borewells on the dip-side
of the quarry are used for partial dewatering and the water is used, after
treatment, in colony for drinking purposes.

and convey it to the modified settling pond. HEHM and vehicle vashings will
also be conveyed to this settling pond after initial treatment to remove
grease and oil which will be completed by December 1996. This settling pond
will not have any positive discharge except during the peak of monsoon season
when it has a minimum retention time of 24 hours. Studies to determine the
efficacy of sewage disposal system on ground water quality will be completed
by June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Two water trucks are in operation to reduce the level of dust in and
around mine areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements are
insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in specific work-
ing areas, avenue planting along the coal transport road, will be contemplated
in fiscal year 1997-98. Periodic noise problems in the HENM workshop will be
dealt with by providing hearing protection to exposed workers by June 1996.
The company will request the Chandrapur thermal power station for greater
enforcement of particulate suppression in the CTPS. WCL will participate in
the regional air quality management and programme as and when it starts.
Disturbed land reclamation
In view of the existing results to date in reclaiming overburden slopes
at slopes over 350, in future, physical reclamation will achieve the maximum
slope of 280 before revegetation is carried out. There is a backlog of 34ha of
disturbed land due to external overburden dumps. An engineering study is pro-
posed to be conducted for slope stability of these overburden dumps during
1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of the study, these dumps are
proposed to be resloped to the safer angle, if necessary, by rehandling of
overburden. Otherwise, if found stable, these areas will be developed by bio-
logical reclamation of Bha in 1997-98 and 15ha each in 1998-99 and 1999-2000.
Reclamation of currently disturbed land will be undertaken at the rate of 15ha
per year with effect from 1995-96.

Air quality and noise management
Air quality monitoring results near the sub-area manager's office and
residential colonies are generally in compliance with the appropriate stan-
dards in all seasons but pre-monsoon when periodic excursions occur. Signifi-
cant air pollution appears to originate from CTPS which is upwind of the mine
site. Day time and night time noise levels around the HEHM workshop occasion-
ally exceed the Limits for industrial areas. Noise levels in the colony area
are regularly in compliance with standards.
Regional environmental status
The level of operations and the pollutants generated from this mine are
not likely to affect regional air or water quality to any appreciable level.
Disturbed land reclamation
Existing external dump have outer slopes of 35°-40° and heights varying
from 26-50m. There are four existing overburden dumps which slope up to 40°.
Recontouring and regrading of the slopes has not been done. Some tree planting
has been done on flat portions of the overburden dump after spreading of top-
soil.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Three air quality monitoring stations have been reorganised in the
project network in 1995 at the quarry, near Padmapur village and at the resi-
dential colony. one more station is proposed to be set up to monitor ambient
air quality between CTPS and the mine area from post monsoon 1995. For fre-
quency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for two
days in a month or two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. Mean-
while CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be com-
plied with after its notification. Three water quality sampling stations will
continue. Quarterly samples of water quality and water level will be taken at
one domestic well in Padmapur village. One more water sample is proposed to b4
taken regularly in the well/tube well in the residential colony to assess the
impacts of sewage on ground water. Three noise monitoring stations already
fixed will continue for noise level monitoring.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 8.5km of garland drains will be constructed by December
1996 to collect runoff from the outer slopes of the external overburden dumps

479.8ha of dry agricultural land, 20.2ha of Government barren land and a bal-
ance of unoccupied, undeveloped land and small villages. No forest land is
involved. The mine is located about 3km southwest of the Wardha river.
Baseline data
The project was sanctioned in 1981, hence no baseline information was
required. However, environmental quality data was collected in 1988 for formu-
lation of the EMP. The data indicates that air quality at all air stations was
within the standards. Water quality at the quarry and Gouri nallah conformed
to the prescribed limits. Noise levels were within the threshold limits.

Mine planning and design
The seam is divided into top, middle and bottom sections by 2m thick
stone bands. Due to the flat gradient and longer strike length, a dragline has
been deployed in the quarry. The use of a dragline is, however, restricted to
a 31m thick overburden just above the coal seam. Top soil, up to a depth of
10m, is removed by scrapers. Hard rock below the topsoil is blasted wherever
necessary and excavated by 4.6m3 hydraulic shovels. Coal is won by 2m' shovels
in combination with 35 tonne rear dumpers. Conventional drilling and blasting
is practised. Coal production is currently hauled by truck approximately 4km
through the leasehold area to a rail line and loading facility at Sasti rail-
way siding. Current overburden production will be used for backfilling the
void as well as to create external overburden dumps. Dumping on external over-
burden dumps will be done until 2000, as sufficient voids are not available
within the quarry for backfilling. After five years, all the overburden will
be used in backfilling. The area of external overburden dump is 118.1ha. Dump
materials consist of a mixture of sandstone and friable sandy silts. Areas of
the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total residual life of 13
years of mine life are s follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environment monitoring was started with effect from the monsoon season
of 1992. However, it was discontinued and started been in January 1995. Three
air monitoring stations have been established: two in the core zone (near
quarry site and manager's office) and one in buffer zone (in the colony).
Water quality stations are the mine sump and Gouri nallah upstream and down-
stream of the project. Noise readings are taken day and night at the mine
office, quarry site and colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a decoaled area on the pit floor. Water is
then pumped out for various industrial and miscellaneous purposes and has been
in compliance with Government of India discharge standards. Garland drains and



- 203 -
settling ponds are yet to be constructed to control and treat runoff from the
external overburden dumps. The workshop and vehicle washing area have as yet
no waste water treatment facilities.
Air quality and noise management
Comprehensive dust suppression measures are being undertaken at the mine
site. The coal handling plant is equiped with a water spraying arrangement.
All the haul roads are regularly sprayed with water. Air quality at the mine
office, quarry site and the colony is in compliance with the appropriate stan-
dards in all seasons but pre-monsoon, when periodic excursions occur. Day time
and night time noise levels in the quarry, sub area manager's office and
colony area are in compliance with standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
The existing external dumps have outer slopes of 280-350 and heights that
vary from 13-26m and appear to be stable. Tree planting activities have been
carlied out on external overburden dumps during 1994-95.
Environmental management programes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Three air quality monitoring stations have been reorganised in the
project network in 1995 at the following sites: the quarry, near the sub area
manager's office and residential colony. One more station will be set up to
monitor the air quality at nearest village, Gouri. For frequency of air sam-
pling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for two days in a month o:
two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. Meanwhile CPCB is formulat-
ing standards for the coal industry which will be complied with after it noti-
fication. Three water quality sampling stations will continue. Quarterly
samples of the water quality and water level will be taken at one domestic
well in Gouri vil age. Water quality will-also be monitored in the dug well/
openwell in the residential colony to assess the impacts, if any, of the sew-
age disposal system. Three noise monitoring stations already fixed will con-
tinue.
Hydrology and rater quality management
Approximately 7.8km of garland drains will be constructed by December
1996 to collect runoff from the external overburden dumps and convey it to a
proposed settling pond. Effluents from the CEP, HLNM and vehicle washing area
will also be conveyed to this new settling pond after initial treatment to
remove grease and oil. Oil and grease traps will be completed by December



- 204 -
1996. Studies to determine the adequacy of sewage disposal to ground in the
colony area will be complied by June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Two water tankers are in operation to reduce the level of dust in and
around mine areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements are
insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in specific work-
ing areas will be contemplated in fiscal year 1997-98. If a noise problem in
the HEHM workshop is diagnosed, suitable action will be taken to bring it
within standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
In view of results to date in reclaiming overburden slopes at slopes
over 35o, in the future physical reclamation will achieve the maximum slope of
280 before revegetation is carried out. 41ha (on the top of the dump) of dis-
turbed land is due to external overburden dumps. An engineering study is pro-
posed to be conducted for slope stability of these overburden dumps during
1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of the study, these dumps are
proposed to be resloped to safer angle, if necessary, by rehandling of over-
burden. Otherwise, if found stable, these areas will be taken up for biologi-
cal reclamation of 9ha in 1997-98 and 18ha each in 1598-99 and 1999-2000.
Reclamation of currently disturbed land will be undertaken at the rate of
13.44ha (8.64ha in backfilled areas and 4.8ha in freshly created dump) per
year with effect from 1995-96.

Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Umrer mine is located about 50km from Nagpur and is situated on flat
plains which slope very gently towards the Amb River flowing along the south-
ern boundary of the mine area. Workers' residential colonies are concentrated
on the northern side of the project, away from the mine area. Prior to mining,
the leasehold area of 807.3ha consisted of 733.5ha of dry agriculture land and
73.8ha of Government barren land. No forest land is involved in this project.
Baseline data
As the mine was started in 1963, baseline data was not required. How-
ever, an environmental quality assessment was done in 1989-90.
Mine planning and design
Umrer project is an on-going project. There are three workable coal
seams: top (6.8-9.4m thick), middle (3.4-6.1m thick) and bottom (15-27m thick)
being worked by opencast mining. Scrapers are used for removing top soil.
Partings 1 *ween the bottom and middle seam and the middle and top seam (up to
21m) is re. ied by dragline. The balance of overburden is removed by shovel-

dumper combination (5m0 electric rope shovel and 35 tonne rear dumpers). Coal
is removed by shovel-dumper system. Conventional drilling and blasting is
adopted for breaking overburden and coal. Current overburden production is
used entirely for backfilling the quarry voids. Coal production is currently
hauled by truck 2km through the area. The area of external overburden dumps
for the project will be 82ha. Dump materials consist of a mixture of rock and
friable sandy silts. Areas of the leasehold that will be occupied by mine
facilities to the end of the current five years (1995-96 to 1999- 2000) and at
the end of mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started during the monsoon season of 1992.
However, it was discontinued and started again from January 1995. Air quality
readings are taken at three stations including the workers' colony. Water
quality monitoring stations are at the siltation pond and the upstream and
downstream sides of Amb river. Noise readings are taken day and night at the
workshop, CHP and residential colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a series of ponds in the pit area and is
pumped out for various industrial and miscellaneous uses. Positive discharge
from the pit sump occurs only during the peak monsoon. Quality of this water
has regularly been in compliance with CPCB discharge standards. Garland drains
and settling ponds are to be constructed to control and treat runoff from the
external overburden dumps. Waste water treatment plants for effluents from the
coal handling plant, workshop and vehicle maintenance shop are also to be
constructed.
Air quality and noise management
Air quality at three stations (the mine site, near the CEP and at work-
ers' residential colonies) is in compliance with the appropriate standards.
The CEP is well equipped with an effective water spraying system. Day time and
night time noise levels around the CEP, workshop and residential colony are
also in compliance with standards.



- 209 -
Disturbed land reclamation
Out of the total 82ha of external overburden dumps, only 25ha is yet to
be vegetated. Most of these dumps are sloped at 30-40 and have heights of 40-
50m. Massive tree planting has taken place on the balance of 57ha of external
overburden dumps and the area has been converted into a recreation site.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Siting of the existing three air quality monitoring stations will be re-
examined. One more station is proposed in the nearest village on the downwind
side. Samples will be drawn on a 24 hourly basis for two days in a month or
two days in a quarter depending on pollution load. At present, CPCB is formu-
lating standards for the coal industry which will be complied with after its
notification. Three existing water quality sampling stations will continue.
Quarterly samples of water quality and water level will be taken at one domes-
tic well in the Kanwah village. Three existing noise monitoring stations will
continue.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 4.3km of garland drains will be constructed by December
1996 to collect runoff from outer slopes of the external overburden dumps and
convey it to a proposed settling pond. Runoff from HENM and vehicle washing
areas will also be conveyed to this settling pond after initial treatment to
remove grease and oil which will also be completed by December 1996. Studies
of adequacy of existing sewage disposal system will be completed by June 1996.
Air quality and noise management
Two water tankers are in operation for dust suppression in and around
the pit and plant areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improve-
ments are insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in
specific working areas will be contemplated in 1997-98. If a noise problem is
diagnosed in the HEMM workshop, action will be taken to bring it within stan-
dards. As a last resort, workers will be provided with protective gear.
Disturbed land reclamation
All external overburden dumps except for 25ha have been successfully
vegetated. Areas of the internal dump will be gradually reclaimed. However, an
engineering study is proposed to be conducted for slope stability of these
overburden dumps during 1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of the



- 210 -
study, if required, these dumps may be resloped to stable angle by rehandling.
overburden, if found stable, will be developed by biological reclamation.
Approximately lOOha backfilled area will be available up to the year 2000 at
the rate of 20ha each year with effect from 1995-96. This will be technically
and biologically reclaimed each year.

Haryana
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The KD Resalong project is located in an undulating terrain having a
rolling topography. The project covers an area of 481ha and at its inception
in 1968 it included 300ha of low density forest. Out of this, 170ha of forest
land has been utilized in past mining activities. Some 130ha of forest land,
falling in the proposed Quarry-II where work has yet to start, has already
been degraded due to intermittent coal stocking and illegal felling by the
local villagers. The Damodar river, which is the main drainage channel in the
area, flows on the northern side of the project area. A cement factory at
Khelari, which is about 5km southwest of the project, was working up to 1992-
93. But for the last two years it has been closed. There are other coal mines
surrounding this project.
Baseline data
The mine started functioning in 1968 and at that stage it was not re-
quired to generate baseline environmental data. This started only in 1987-88
for the formulation of the EMP for the expansion project report. For genera-
tion of air quality data, one station was located in the working zone and five
stations were located in the buffer z-tne. The levels of SPM in the working



- 214 -
zone though high, were within prescribed levels as per Coal Mining Regula-
tions, 1957. The levels of SPN in the buffer zone (ambient condition) were
found to be within the prescribed limits. At all monitoring stations, levels
of noxious gases were found to be below prescribed levels. Surface water was
monitored in the Damodar river upstream and downstream of the project. As part
of the baseline data generation, soil samples of the virgin area were also
tested for their physical and chemical properties.
Mine planning and design
The mine is planned to be worked by opencast method with conventional
truck and shovel combination. Presently the mine is working in the east quarry
(Quarry-I). Working in Quarry-II will start within a few months. In course of
mining in the past, a part of the overburden removed from the quarry was
dumped outside at two locations. Part of it was used to construct the embank-
ment against the Damodar River and the remainder was dumped in an external
dump close to the northern boundary of Quarry-I. From 1988-89, all overburden
materials removed from Quarry-I were used for backfilling of the decoaled pit.
It is planned to continue the backfilling of Quarry-I and then subsequently
start back-filling Quarry II. The backfilling in Quarry-I will leave a space
of 50m from the mining face to facilitate future extension of the mine on the
dip side. The profile of the backfilled area will merge with local landscape.
The area of leasehold occupied by mine facilities at the end of current five
year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and 40 years of mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Continuous environmental monitoring has been carried out since 1993. Air
quality monitoring stations are located at the pit office, P.O. office and
Dakra guest house. The first two stations are located in the working zone and
the last one is located in the ambient zone. The water quality monitoring
station covers mine water and Damodar river up and down stream of the project.
Noise monitoring is being done at the project office, pit office and Dakra
guest house.



- 215 -
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in the mine at the pit floor and is subsequently
pumped to a pond located on the northern side of the quarry. There is no over-
flow from this pond at any time of the year. This pond is actually an old
abandoned pit. Presently, the CHP has no regular water treatment facility. The
spent water flows to a nearby pond and is lost due to seepage and evaporation.
In the workshop, a grease and oil trap has been constructed which treats the
industrial waste.
Air quality and noise management
The level of gaseous pollutants have been found below the prescribed
limit. The level of SPM has marginally exceeded the limit of 500mgr3 at one
location (the pit office) in April 1994 and February 1994. This station is
located in the working zone. At other stations, levels of SPM have been found
to be below the prescribed limit. In monitoring excercises carried out before
1992, the level of SPM in the working zone was found to be high, but since
1992, when the cement plant was closed down, the SPM level has come down con-
siderably.
Disturbed land reclamation
In the course of past mining activities, mine waste was utilised for
construction of an embankment against Damodar river and also to form an exter-
nal dump. The slope of the face of the embankment varies between 35' and 450
and has stabilized. The height of the dump is less than 25m. Part of the em-
bankment (approx. 2ha) has already been biologically reclaimed. The environ-
mental clearance letter does not require regrading of this dump. The external
ove_bn.-den dump located on the northern boundary of Quarry-I, measures ap-
proximately lOha and its approximate height is 30m. This was formed during
1986-87. This area is yet to be reclaimed. The slope of the external dump
varies between 400 and 450. A total of seven internal dumps have already been
made covering an area of about 45ha and all located within Quarry-I. They were
formed during 1988-94. Two internal dumps have already been planted covering
an area of about 17.6ha and one is partly planted. The remaining four internal
dumps are yet to be reclaimed.

From 1995-96, one air quality monitoring station will be established in
the work zone at the pit office. Three monitoring stations will be located
outside the mine area, one at Bukbuka colony on the eastern side, one in



- 216 -
Arungarha village in southeastern side and one at the subarea office. The air
monitoring station at Bukbuka colony represents the nearest township and the
air monitoring station at Arungarha represents the nearest village to the
workzone. Air monitoring will be done on quarterly basis. If the level of the
pollutants exceed the prescribed limit, the frequency will be increased to
monthly basis. Surface water in Damodar river will be monitored at two sta-
tions, one upstream and one downstream of the project. Ground water will be
monitored at Bukbuka colony and Arungarha village through sampling of well
waters. Mine water and treated waste water from the workshop will also be
monitored. Noise levels will be monitored at all air monitoring stations.
Hydrology and water quality management
It is proposed to provide a 1.2km garland drain on south side of Quarry-
II to intercept the surface runoff and divert it to Kendua naLlah on the west-
ern side. Mine water will be collected in a mine sump and subsequently pumped
to a sedimentation lagoon to be located on the southwest side of Quarry-II.
Overflow from the lagoon wll flow into Kendua nallah. It is proposed to pro-
vide an oil and grease trap in the new workshop to treat industrial waste
water generated in the workshop. The spent water from the CHP will be col-
lected and diverted to a surface lagoon. The CHP is proposed to be located on
the northeastern side of Quarry-I.
Air quality and noise management
In order to control dust generation from haul roads, a total of three
water sprinklers are proposed to be procured, two in 1995-96 and one in 1996-
97. Drills will be provided with dust collection facilities and a dust sup-
pression system will be installed at the CHP. In addition, greenbelts/avenue
planting will be provided at various locations within the mine area for dust
suppression. This includes avenue planting along the haul road, other roads
and the railway siding, greenbelts around the industrial area and quarry.
Block planting will be done in vacant plots- A 30m wide green belt consisting
of 10 rows of trees and shrubs will be provided around Arungarha village to
protect it from dust pollution.
Disturbed land reclamation
The Environmental clearance for the project conveyed through letter No.
J11015/35/84-Env.5/1A II(K) dt. 27/29-.h October 1993, laid down a condition
that no further external dumping should be done. In compliance with this
stipulation, it is proposed to place all overburden to be removed during fu-
ture mining operations in the decoaled pit. It is proposed to continue to use
the overburden to be removed from Quarry-II to backfill the remaining voids of
Quarry-I, except for a 50m wide strip at the dip most side which is necessary



- 217 -
to facilitate mining of coal reserves available on the dip side beyond the
boundary of present quarry. After the voids in Quarry-I are filled up to the
required extent, backfilling of voids of Quarry-II will commence. The profile
of the backfilled area will be such that it merges with prevailing landscape.
Once the backfilling is over, the surface is to be dozed to render a proper
slope to ensure drainage. Next, a layer of top soil is to be spread over the
prepared surface. Finally, biological reclamation will follow over the physi-
cally reclaimed backfill area. It is proposed to reclaim 8ha, 18ha, 12ha, 12ha
and 12ha during 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 respectively.
This will be confined to the backfilled area of Quarry-I and the existing
external dump.

Operational startup:    1993
Type of mine:    Opencast
Mining method:    Truck & shovel
Current production:    0.35 million tonnes
Capacity:    1.75 million tonnes
Mine life:    27 years
Residual life:    25 years
Number of coal seams:    5 (Thicknebs: averages 27.6m)
Ash zontent:    33.5-34.5%
Strip ratio:    2.7:1
Max. quarry depth:    102m
Coal destination:    Linked to Parej Washery for supplying
coking coal to various Steel Plants
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
Parej project, situated in an undulating terrain, has a rolling topogra-
phy. Bokaro nallah flows close to the project area on the southern side and
Chutua nallah flows on the northern side. The total project area measures
395.4ha which includes 57.6ha of forest of medium density, 74ha of dry agri-
cultural land and the balance of land is Government land, mostly waste land.
There are two villages within the mining leasehold (Parej and Dhurkusmar)
which are to be shifted shortly. There are other coal projects in the area
including Tapin colliery on the western side and West Bokaro colliery on the
eastern side.
Mine plan and design
The mine is planned to be worked by opencast method with conventional
truck and shovel combination, both for coal and overburden removal with maxi-
mum in-pit backfilling. Out of a total overburden volume of 114.8 million m3,
it is proposed to dump only 11.4 million m3 as external dump and the balance
of 103.4 million m3 is to be used for backfilling the voids of decoaled pit.
The external dump is to be completed and reclaimed by the end of the seventh
year of mining operation. The coal produced from this mine is to be supplied



- 222 -
to the pit-head washery which is to be located on the north side of the mine.
The coal will be transported by belt conveyor to the washery. The break-up of
the area of the leasehold occupied by facilities at the end of 2000 and post-
mining stage at the end of 27 years life is given below:

Baseline environmental data
The pre-mining baseline environmental data was generated during 1989-90
for formulation of the project EMP. A total of eight air monitoring stations
were fixed including one on the work zone (core zone) and seven outside the
mine area (buffer zone) representing the ambient situation. Surface water
quality was also monitored through two samples collected from Bokaro nallah
and one sample from Chutua nallah. Noise level readings were also taken at air
monitoring stations.
Project monitoring, auditingr and evaluation
The project EMP was prepared based on the premining environmental sce-
nario and has been approved by NOEF. As per the guidelines of MOEF, the envi-
ronmental qual3ty (including air quality, water quality and noise level) are
being monitored regularly on a quarterly basis. Air monitoring stations are
located at the site office and pump house, both of which are located within
the mine boundary. Mine water is also being monitored. Noise readings are
taken at the site office and pump house during the day and night. In all moni-
toring results, the levels of SPM and noxious gases have been found to be much
below the prescribed level. The effluent quality also conforms to the standard
laid down by CPCB. Noise levels have been found to be well within the pre-
scribed level.
Hydrology and water quality management
Presently the mine water is being collected in the mine sump located on
the mine floor and is being pumped out to a local depression on the surface in
the eastern side which serves as a sedimentation lagoon. Due to the prevailing
topography, garland drains have not been required so far. A CHP and workshop
are under construction and h-nce waste water is not yet generated at those
points.



- 223 -
Air quality and noise management
Presently a water sprinkler is being used to regularly spray water on
haul roads to control the dust.
Disturbed land reclamation
The external dump is under formation and a stage has not reached by
which a part of it can be reclaimed.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
From 1995, the air quality will be monitored at two additional loca-
tions, the residential colony and Dhurkusmar village. The two stations repre-
sent the ambient situation. Additionally, surface water quality will be moni-
tored from Bokaro nallah and Chutua nallah. Well water will also be monitored
from residential colony and Dhurkusmar village. Nine water will also be moni-
tored on a regular basis and will be sampled from the sedimentation lagoon. In
the workshop, the waste water after treatment will be monitored. The noise
level will be monitored at all air monitoring stations. The monitoring
programme will be on a quarterly basis.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately lkm of garland drain will be constructed during 1996-97 to
intercept surface runoff flowing into the mine during the monsoon. Mine water
-will be collected in a central sump at the mine floor and will be pumped to a
sedimentation lagoon to be located to the northeast side of the quarry. This
lagoon will work up to the eighth year of mine operation and afterwards, an-
other one will be constructed on the southeastern side. In the workshop, which
is under construction, an industrial waste treatment plant is proposed. The
industrial waste water will be treated at this unit and recirculated for wash-
ing purposes. The spent water from the CHP will be collected through a series
of diversion channels conveyed to a separate lagoon. For external dumps, catch
drains along the ramps and foot drains will be established to collect the
surface runoff and diverted to a separate lagoon.
Air quality and noise management
Two water tankers will be procured for haul road spraying, one during
1995-96 and the other in 1996-97. In the CHP, a dust suppression and collec-
tion unit will be provided. Drills with a dust suppression and extraction
system will be procured. Tree planting along the haul road and greenbelts



- 224 -
along the industrial area and along the CHP have also been planned. Green
belts around villages will be established.
Disturbed land reclamation
As per the plan, the external dump covering 34.9ha will accommodate 11.4
million m3 of overburden. This dump is currently in the formation stage and
will be completed within the next five years. Physical reclamation will start
from the third year of mine operation and will be followed by biological rec-
lamation. As per the stipulation of MOEF, the sloping face will be regraded to
280. The entire external dump will be reclaimed by the seventh year. After-
wards, the backfilled area will be developed by both physical and biological
reclamation. It is proposed to remove the top soil from the quarry and over-
burden dump site and conserve it for re-use during the biological reclamation
stage.

Cuzrent environental status
Envizonmental setting
Rajrappa opencast project is situated in an undulating terrain having a
rolling topography. The Damodar river flows to the north of the project area
and its tributary Bhera river flows on the eastern side. The project area
covers 1417ha, including 775.3ha of forest land. The required land, including
forest land, has been acquired. At the premining stage, non-forest land in-
cluded 16ha of paddy land, lOlha of non-irrigated agricultural land and about
526ha of waste land. At present, mining and allied activities have already
used a large area of land. Rajrappa Washery is located on eastern side of the
project.
Baseline environmental data
The mine started functioning in 1977 and at that stage, baseline envi-
ronmental data was not generated. However, environmental data was generated
during 1987-88 for formulation of the EMP for the project. A total of six air
monitoring stations were fixed including four stations in the work zone and
two stations in the buffer zone, representing ambient condition. Surface water
was monitored in the Damodar river at one location. Noise levels were moni-



- 228 -
tored at five locations including at colony, washery, workshop, haulage road
and overburden dump. Top soil samples were also tested.
Mine planning and design
The mine was planned to work by opencast method with conventional truck
and shovel combination. The project consists of two main quarries (Quarry-I
and Quarry-II) with four auxiliary quarries (Sections Ia, lb, hIa and IIb).
The mine has been planned with maximum possible backfilling. The backfilling
has been limited due to the unfavorable dip of the mine floor (about 110).
Areas of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current
five year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the 50 years of
life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Regular environmental monitoring on a quarterly basis has been carried
out since summer 1993. This monitoring programme covers air quality, water
quality and noise levels. Air monitoring stations are located at the pit of-
fice, workshop and guest house. The first two stations represent the work zone
area and the last one represents the ambient zone. Mine water is sampled from
the mine-sump. Noise level monitoring stations are located at air quality
monitoring stations.
Hydrology and water quality management
At present, mine water is collected at mine sump located in Quarry-I and
Section Ilb. Subsequently, it is pumped to a lagoon on the western side and is
used for dust suppression and other industrial uses. Presently, waste water
from the workshop is being collected in a pond located on the eastern side and
is lost due to seepage and evaporation. An oil and grease trap is under con-
struction and is likely to be completed within a couple of months. There is no
CHP in the project. Surface runoff from external dumps is collected through a
diversion channel and conveyed to a lagoon on the western side. Garland drains
have been provided around working quarries on the western side. These inter-
cept surface runoff and divert it to the natural drainage channels. Open



- 229 -
drains have been provided along haul roads to collect surface runoff and di-
vert it to natural drains.
Air quality and noise management
In order to suppress dust from haul roads, the following arrangements
have been made. A fixed water spraying system has been installed along the
main haul road. In addition, one mobile water sprinkler has also been pro-
vided. Avenue planting along haul roads, other roads and block plantation has
also been provided to check air pollution and help with noise abatement. The
monitoring results have shown that levels of SPM and gaseous pollutants are
below prescribed limits. Noise levels at various monitoring stations have been
found to be below prescribed levels.
Disturbed land reclamation
In the course of mining during 18 years, 12 external dumps and six in-
ternal dumps have been formed. There are two major external dumps, one on the
eastern side covering an area of 54ha and another on the western side which
presently covers an area of 71ha. The eastern dump has been biologically re-
claimed. The western dump is a live dump and reclamation has not yet been
started. Of the ten remaining external dumps, two have been fully reclaimed,
three are in the process of reclamation and on another three reclamation is
yet to start. Two dumps are still in use. The slopes of a.L1 reclaimed dumps
are now stable. The total reclaimed area of external dumps is 72.2ha and the
area of unreclaimed dumps is about l9ha. The area of active external dumps is
78ha. The slopes of active dumps will be maintained at 280 in compliance with
MOEF's stipulation contained in the environmental clearance letter. Presently,
the area of internal dumps is 37ha, ot of which nearly 23ha has been fully
reclaimed.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
From 1995-96, two more air monitoring stations will be added, one at
Sidhu Kano nagar (the rehabilitation site), and the second at Koihara village.
Surface water will be monitored at two more locations in Damodar river - one
upstream and the other downstream of the project. Ground water will be moni-
tored through samples from wells in the township, Sidhu Kano nagar and Koihara
village. Kine water samples will be collected from the overflow point of the
sedimentation pond. Treated industrial water will be collected for quality
monitoring.

Hydrology and water quality mana!rement
In addition to existing garland drains around the working mine, it is
proposed to construct an additional 550m long garland drain on the eastern
side of Quarry II during 1995-96. One more lagoon will be provided on the
western side of Quarry II to treat water from this quarry. It is expected that
the oil and grease trap in the workshop, which is presently under construc-
tion, will be completed and commissioned before June 1995.
Air quality and noise management
It is proposed to procure one more water sprinkler during 1995-96 and
the stationary water sprinkling system will be extended to the new haul road
serving Quarry II. Avenue planting will be extended to cover the new haul road
and other roads. Block planting will be done in open spaces within the mining
area and also around Koihara village to protect it from air pollution.
Disturbed land reclamation
Three external dumps covering an area of 12ha are under various stages
of reclamation. Their reclamation will be completed during 1995-96. Other
unreclaimed external dumps covering an area of 6ha vill be reclaimed during
1996-97. In the course of future mining operations, the overburden removed
from Quarry I will be dumped in the western dump and the overburden removed
from Quarry II will be dumped partly in the decoaled pit and partly in the
northern dump. The internal dumps (covering an area of 12ha) will be reclaimed
during 1996-97.

BISRAMPUR
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine:    Bisrampur
Company:    SECL
State:    Madhya Pradesh
Coalfield:    Bisrampur
Year of sanction:    1959
Operational startup:    1959-60
Type of mine:    Opencast
-      Mining method:    Dragline/Truck & shovel
Current production:    1.13 million tonnes
Capacity:    1.10 million tonnes
Mine life:    40 years
Residual life:    8 years
Number of coal seams:    1 (Thickness: 2-2.5m)
Ash content:    20-22%
Strip ratio:    6.5:1
Max. quarry depth:    34m
Coal destination:    Miscellaneous industrial users
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
Bisrampur opencast mine is situated on a gently undulating terrain sur-
rounded by several nallahs. The main river (Rehar river) flows on the west of
the mine area. Residential colonies are concentrated in the west between the
mine site and Rehar river. The main drainage.is Passang nallah which flows
east to west and forms a tributary to Rehar river. There are many villages
situated approximately 2 to 5km from the active mining area. Prior to mining,
the leasehold area of 1472ha consisted of 983ha of agricultural land, 5ha of
water bodies and 484ha of forest land used for wood production.
Baseline data
No baseline data is available for this project because it pre-dates the
environmental legislation.
Mine planning and design
There is only one workable coal seam, Passang seam, which dips gently in
a northeasterly direction. The Bisrampur project is designed for maximum back-
fill. The initial surface cut and external overburden dumps were undertaken
from 1961 to 1964 entirely by dumper and shovel operation. In 1964, the.



- 234 -
project commissioned a dragline in Quarry No.1 and another dragline in 1967 in
the same quarry. These have carried out all subsequent overburden excavation
and back filling. The two draglines are at present working in Quarry No. 8. A
shovel and dumper combination is deployed in Quarry No. 9. Dump materials
consist of a mixture of friable rock and loose sand. Coal production is cur-
rently hauled by dumpers up to 5km to a CHP for wagon loading. Areas of the
leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total 40 year mine life
are as follows:

Note:  About 660ha of land is used for con colony of Disraupur. Jainagar and Kucda Sub Area. This is not
included in the figure given above.
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started in the post-monsoon season of 1991.
Air quality readings are taken at four stations, i.e. near GM's office, CHP,
Quarry No.8 and Keshav nagar village. Four water quality stations are located
at CHP-washings outlet, Rehar river water (before filter), mine discharge
water and open well water of Keshav nagar village. Noise readings are taken.
day and night at four stations, i.e. dragline operation point, workshop, near
CHP and Keshav nagar village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in the quarry bed and then released to Rehar
river via Passang nallah. The settling pond for quarry water has not been
constructed. Garland drains and settling ponds have not yet been constructed
to control and treat runoff from the external overburden dumps. The coal han-
dling plant, workshop and vehicle washing areas have, as yet, no waste water
treatment facilities.
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate levels in the mine quarry regularly exceed the
maximum allowable objective for industrial areas of 500pg/m3. Air quality at
the mine office and residential colonies is regularly in compliance with the



- 235 -
appropriate standard in all seasons except pre-monsoon, when periodic excur-
sions do occur. Day time and night time noise levels around the HEMM and work-
shop occasionally exceed the limit for industrial areas. Noise levels around
the quarry, CHP and colony areas are regularly in compliance with standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
The total area of external dumps is 20ha of which 2ha resulted from
shovel/dumper combination and 18ha from dragline operations. External dumps
have outer slopes of 350-40° and heights vary from 20-30m. Prior to 1993-94,
biological reclamation was done on part of the existing overburden dumps. The
results achieved are encouraging. From 1993-94, resloping of internal and
external overburden dumps has been taken up through Madhya Pradesh State Land
Development Corporation. Tree planting with grass and legume seeding by Madhya
Pradesh State Forest Development Corporation has also been started.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
No other industry is nearby, so regional cumulative environmental impact
is not envisaged.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999- 2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Four air quality monitoring stations are considered adequate. As for
frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for
two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending on pollution load.
Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. The number of water quality sampling
stations (four) will be increased to include a settling pond for treating
runoff from overburden dumps, upstream and downstream of Rehar river and a
well/hand pump in the colony. Thus, there will be eight water quality monitor-
ing stations after 1995..Quarterly water level measurements will be taken from
one domestic well in colony and from a well in Keshav nagar village. The cur-
rent noise monitoring programme at four stations is considered adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 7km of garland drains will be constructed by 1996-97 to
collect runoff from the outer slopes of the external overburden dump and con-
vey it to a new settling pond. Runoff from the CHP, HEMM and vehicle washings
will also be conveyed to another settling pond after initial treatment to
remove grease and oil.



- 236 -
Air quality and noise management
The water spraying system at the CEP will be made fully operational.
This together with the present water spraying arrangement by tankers on haul
roads etc., appears adequate. In addition, 100,000 trees will be planted dur-
ing next five years, at a rate of 20,000 trees per year, along road sides and
infrastructural areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements
are insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in specific
working areas will be contemplated in fiscal year 1997-98.
Disturbed land reclamation
The current backlog of external overburden is 538ha. The backlog will be
reclaimed at a rate of 158ha in 1995-96, lOOha in 1996-97, lOOha in 1997-98,
lOOha in 1998-99, and 80ha in 1999-2000. In addition to this, during 1995-96
to 1999-2000, an additional area of 208ha in the backfilled pit will be avail-
able, giving a total of 208ha, 150ha, ISOha, 150ha, 120ha for reclamation
during these 5 years. At an average cost per hectare of Rs21,600 for
resloping, Rs2l,600 for grass and legume seeding and Rs.52,400 (including
maintenance cost) for tree planting, the annual reclamation cost for these
five years would be Rs19.88, 14.34, 14.34, 14.34 and 11.47 million, respec-
tively.

Current environmental status
Environmental setting
Dhanpuri opencast mine is situated on gently undulating terrain which
slopes in a southwesterly direction towards Baghaiya nallah, approximately
1.6km from the mine boundary. The workers' colony is situated about 5km from
the mine site, whereas the resettlement colony at Silpari village is about 2km
from the northern boundary of the mine. In addition, two villages, Deohara and
Dhirol, are located to the southern side of the mine area but outside the
leasehold, about 4km from the active mining area. Prior to mining, the
leasehold area was 1122ha. Out of this, 376.1ha of land had been transferred
to Amlai project. The balance 746ha consisted of 170ha of dry agricultural
land, 44.lha of irrigated agricultural land, 12.8ha village land, 6.5ha water
bodies and 512.6ha of forest and shrub land used for rough grazing and fuel
wood production.
Baseline data
No baseline data is available for this project as it predates the envi-
ronmental legislation.



- 240 -
Mine planning and design
The project has a nearly flat seam which dips at 1 in 16 in a northerly
direction from Baghaiya Nallah. The project is designed for maximum backfill.
The initial surface cut and external overburden dumps were undertaken during
1979, entirely by dumper and shovel operation. The project acquired a 10/70
dragline-in 1987 and deployed it for overburden excavation and pit backfill
until 1989. The second dragline (20/90) was acquired by the project in 1989.
To date, the two draglines have been working on overburden excavation and
backfilling. Coal production is currently hauled by dumpers about Skm to the
rail head where wagon loading facilities are available. The area of leasehold
occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current 5 year plan and antici-
pated to the total 32 years mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Regular environmental monitoring has been carried out since the winter
season of 1991. Air quality readings are taken at five stations - around mine
time keeper's office, the workshop, CUP, residential colony and nearby Deohara
village. Water quality monitoring is done at five stations - mine discharge
point, upstream and down stream of Baghaiya nallah, the residential colony and
at a well of Deohara village. In addition to this, water levels are also taken
at a well in Deohara village. Noise readings at five stations are taken day
and night around CEP, project office, workshop, overburden dump area and
Deohara village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in mine sumps of the pit area. Discharge from
the final pit sump has regularly been in compliance with discharge standards.
The garland drain and settling ponds have not yet been constructed to control
and treat runoff from the external overburden dumps. The coal handling plant,
workshop and vehicle washing areas have, as yet, no waste water treatment
facilities.



- 241 -
Alr quality and noise menagement
Suspended particulate matter levels around the mine quarry have regu-
larly been in compliance with maximum allowable objective for industrial areas
of 500J±g/m3 Air quality at the mine timekeeper's office, around the workshop,
CUP, residential colony and nearby Deohara village is regularly in compliance
with the appropriate standards in all seasons. Day time and night time noise
levels around CHP, project office, workshop, overburden dump area and Deohara
village are regularly in compliance with standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
The total area of external dumps is 36.9ha of which 12.4ha resulted from
initial dumper/shovel operation and 24.5ha from dragline operation. External
dumps formed by shovel and dumper have outer slopes of 50°-70° and heights from
20-25m to 30-40m for those created by dragline. Dump materials consist of a
mixture of rock and sandy silts. Extensive tree planting has been done on
external and internal overburden dumps with the help of Madhya Pradesh State
Forest Research Institute and Madhya Pradesh State Forest Development Corpora-
tion. To date, about 500,000 saplings on about 200ha of external and internal
overburden dumps have bee1i planted. Survival rate is quite satisfactory.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
No other industry is located nearby. Hence, regional cumulative environ-
mental impact is not envisaged.
Environmental management programes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The present five air quality monitoring stations are considerd adequate.
As for frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis
for two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending on pollution load.
Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. One more water quality sampling station
will be added bringing the total to six, to include discharges from the new
settling pond treating runoff from overburden and mine facilities areas.
Present noise monitoring programmes at five stations are considered adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
Two settling tanks will be constructed during 2996-97 for treatment of
mine discharge. Approximately 2km of garland drains will be constructed in
1995-96 to collect runoff from the outer slopes of the external overburden



- 242 -
dumps and convey it to a new settling pond. Runoff from the CUP, HEMH and
vehicle washing areas will also be conveyed to another settling pond after
initial treatment to remove grease and oil.
Air quality and noise management
Two new watering trucks will be acquired, one in 1995-96 and the other
in 1996-97. In addition, 100,000 trees will be planted during the next five
years, at the rate of 20,000 trees per year, along road sides and
infrastructural areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if the improve-
ments are insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in
specific working areas will be contemplated in fiscal year 1997-98. As ambient
noise levels are within standards, no remedial measures are called for.
Disturbed land reclamation
Biological reclamation has been done on existing overburden dumps. Re-
sults achieved are encouraging. However, resloping/recontouring and reclama-
tion of internal and external overburden dumps will be done by a suitable
agency. Tree planting with grass and legume seeding will be done through
Madhya Pradesh State Forest Development Corporation. The current backlog of
inactive disturbed areas is 20ha (to December 1994). An engineering study is
proposed to be conducted for slope stability of these overburden dumps during
1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of the study, if required, these
dumps may-be resloped to stable angle by rehandling. Overburden, if found
suitable, will be taken up for biological reclamation.

and dumper combination has being used for the initial surface cut and external
overburden dumps. Coal production is currently by shovel and dumper combina-
tion and transported by tippers about Bkm to the Gevra project CHP for loading
and dispatch to NTPC and BALCO. Areas of leasehold occupied by the mine fa-
cilities to the end of current five years (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and the an-
ticipated total 48 years mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Regular environmental monitoring was started in the pre-monsoon season
of 1992. Air quality readings are taken adjacent to the mine, at the office
and in the workers colony. Water quality stations are at the mine discharge
point, colony water taps and wells in the nearby villages. Noise readings are
taken during day and night at the workshop and quarry once in a quarter.
Hydrology and water quality management
The mine water is allowed to settle in a large sump in the pit itself.
The positive discharge to the natural course (Lilagar river) takes place only
during heavy monsoon. However, it always complies with Govt. of India dis-
charge standards. Garland drains and settling ponds have not yet been con-
structed to control the runoff from the external overburden dumps. The work-
shop and vehicle washing areas have, as yet, no waste water treatment facili-
ties.
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate levels in the mine quarry occasionally exceed the
maximum allowable objective for industrial areas of 500Sg/Mm3. Air quality at
the mine office and worker colonies is regularly in compliance with the appro-
priate standards in all seasons, but during pre-monsoon season periodic excur-
sions do occur. Day time and night time noise levels around the REMM workshop
and quarry are regularly in compliance with the standards.

trurbed land reclamation
The total area of external dumps is 52ha. External dumps have outside
slopes of 35°-400 and heights up to 15-20m. Dump materials consist of black
cotton soil and soft friable sand stone. Land reclamation is yet to start in
this mine as neither inactive external overburden dump nor backfilled area is
available for reclamation.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
Air quality impacts from a number of industrial operations in the Korba
field, particularly coal mining and power generation, now necessitate a re-
gional approach to monitoring and management.
Environmental 4anagement programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
The three air quality monitoring stations appear to be adequate. As for
frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for
two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending on pollution load.
Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. Water quality sampling stations will be
increased to include the discharge point of a settling tank under construc-
tion, the proposed settling pond for treating runoff from overburden dumps,
upstream and downstream of Lilagar river and well/hand pumps of the colony.
Water level will be taken from one well in the colony and another in a nearby
village. The current noise monitoring programme is considered adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 4km of garland drain will be constructed in 1996 to col-
lect runoff from the outer slopes of the external overburden dumps and convey
it to a new settling pond. Runoff from the HEMM and vehicle washing area will
also be conveyed to a new settling pond after initial treatment to remove
grease and oil. This settling pond will be designed to have no positive dis-
charge except during the peak of monsoon season.
Air quality and noise management
Three water tankers are in use for water spraying on haul roads. One
more water tanker will be added in 1995-96 and will be used for further
strengthening of water spraying on haul roads. About 100,000 trees will be
planted along the coal transport road, around colony and infrastructure during
1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air quality improvement and to act as noise barriers.
Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements are insufficient
chemical retardants and fixed spraying system in specific working area will be



- 248 -
contemplated in the fiscal year 1997-98. Periodic noise problems in the work-
shop will be dealt with by requiring exposed workers to wear hearing protec-
tion.
Disturbed land reclamation
An engineering study is proposed to be conducted for slope stability of
the overburden dumps during 1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of
the study, if required, these dumps may be resloped to stable angles by rehan-
dling. Overburden, if found stable, will be taken up for biological reclama-
tion. So far, no biological reclamation has been done on existing overburden
dump. However, resloping and recontouring of external overburden dumps will
commence from 1997-98, if necessary by engaging a suitable agency. Tree plant-
ing with grass and legume seeding will be done through M.P. State Forest De-
velopment Corporation. The current backlog of inactive external overburden
dump as well as internal overburden dump is 52ha.

and local consumers
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
Gevra mine is situated on flat terrain which slopes very gently in a
southeasterly direction towards the Laxman nallah, approximately 500m away
from the mine leasehold. Three rehabilitated villages are located on the north
side about 3-4km from the active mine area. Prior to mining the leasehold was
2945.6ha. Out of this 193.2ha has been recently transferred to the Dipka
project. The remaining 2752.4ha consisted of lOOSha agricultural land, BOOha
land occupied by villages and ponds, 599.4ha barren field/streams, public road
and 345ha forest land used for rough grazing.
Baseline data
No base data is available for this project as it predates the environ-
mental legislation.
Mine planning and design
The seam dips gently at 1:6 to 1:12 in a southeasterly direction towards
Laxman nallah. The mine is designed for maximum backfill. Overburden excava-
tion and coal winning are done by shovel and dumper. Coal production is cur-

rently transported by dumper 1-4km to feeder breaker and CHP for despatch to
NTPC and other consumers by rail. The area of the leasehold occupied by the
mine facilities to the end of current five year plan and anticipated to the
total mine life of 62 years are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Evironmental monitoring was started in the pre-monsoon season of 1992.
Three air quality stations are around the mine, residential colony and Vijay
nagar village. six water quality stations are at the mine sump, mine discharge
point, two colony water taps, CHP discharge point, and at Vijay Nagar village
well. Noise readings are taken day and night at three stations: around the
workshop, at the CHP and in the colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
The mine water is allowed to settle in the large sump inside the pit
itself. The positive discharge from the mine to the natural source (Laxman
Nallah) takes place only during heavy monsoon and always complies with the
standards. Garland drains and settling ponds have not yet been constructed to
control runoff from external dumps. The CHP, workshop and vehicle washing
areashave waste water treatment facilities. This water, after settling and
initial treatment for grease and oil, is released out through pucca dra2n.
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate levels in the mine quarry occasionally exceed the
maximum allowable objective for industrial areas of 500pg/m3. Air quality at
the mine office and residential colony is regularly in compliance with appro-
priate standards in all seasons except in pre-monsoon seasons when periodic
excursions occur. Noise level readings are regularly in compliance with the
standard.



- 253 -
Disturbed land reclamation
External overburden dump is about 203ha up to 1994, having outer slopes
of 35° to 400 and heights from 20m to 40m Dump materials consist of black cot-
ton soil and loose friable sand stone. Land reclamation was started in this
mine in 1989. Sufficient tree planting has been carried out, the survival of
which is considered satisfactory.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
Air quality impacts from a number of industrial operations in the Korba
field, particularly coal mining and power generation now necessitate a re-
gional approach to monitoring and management of environmental ingredients.
Environmental manageaent programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The present level of air monitoring at three stations is adequate. As
for frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis
for two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending on pollution load.
Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be
complied with after its notification. In 1995-96 four additional water sam-
pling stations will be established (the well at the colony and Vijaynagar
village and upstream and downstream of Laxman nallah)- Water level in the well
of the colony and Vijaynagar village will also be measured. The total number
of water sampling stations will be ten.
Hydrology and water quality management
In 1995-96 and 1996-97 approximately 4km of garland drains will be con-
structed to collect runoff water from the outer slope of the external overbur-
den dumps and convey it to a settling pond to be constructed.
Air quality and noise management
Nine water tankers fitted with spraying arrangements are being regularly
used for haul road water spraying. Water spraying arrangements at the CHP and
feeder breakers for dust suppression are considered adequate. In addition,
100,000 trees will be planted during the next five years at the rate of 20,000
trees per year along road sides and infrastructural areas. Results will be
monitored carefully. If improvement is required, chemical retardents and fixed
spraying system in specific working,areas will be installed in fiscal year
1997-98.

Disturbed land reclamation
So far, biological reclamation has been done on existing overburden
dumps. The result achieved is encouraging. However, an engineering study is
proposed to be conducted for slope stability of these overburden dumps during
1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of the study, if required, these
dumps may be resloped to stable angles by rehandling. Overburden, if found
stable, will be developed by biological reclamation. Tree planting with grass
and legume seeding will be done by Madhya Pradesh State Forest Development
Corporatio.:

Environmental setting
The Kusmunda mine has flat to gently undulating terrain. It lies ap-
proximately 0.5km west of the Hasdeo River. away. Staff and resettlement colo-
nies lie about 2km to the north of the mining area. In addition, four villages
(Gevra Basti, Barpali, Barkuta and Dullapur) are located to the south and
southeast of the mine area, approxima .ely 2-3km away from the active mining
area. The mining activities are likely to approach these villages only after
15 years. Prior to mining the leasehold area of 1544ha consisted of 969ha dry
and irrigated agricultural land and 575ha of Government waste land.
Baseline data
No baseline data is available for this project because it pre-dates
environmental legislation.
Mine planning and design
The surface cut and external overburden dumps commenced in 197e and will
continue throughout the life of the mine by truck and shovel operation. Coal
is won by shovel and dumper combination. Coal production is currently hauled
by trucks 5-6km via haul roads to two coal handling plants for loading into
railway wagons and on the belts transporting coal to MPEB. The Kusmunda

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring has been carried out since the winter season of
1992. Air quality readings are taken at four stations: around the active pit
quarry, at the resettlement/workers' colony, at the CEP and at the workshop.
Six water quality stations are at the mine sump, settling tank, raw water
supplied to filter plant, drinking water from filter plant, colony well and at
Gevra Basti well. Noise readings are taken day and night at four stations: at
the workshop, quarry, coal handling plant and colony.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a series of ponds in the pit area. Positive
discharge from the final pit sump occurs only during the peak of monsoon and
has regularly been in compliance with discharge standards. Garland drains are
constructed around the external dumps and are cleaned every year before onset
of monsoon. However, settling ponds have not yet been constructed to control
and treat run-off from the external overburden dumps. The coal handling plant,
workshop and vehicle washing areas have been provided with waste water treat-
ment facilities.
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate levels in the quarry exceed the maximum allowable
objective for industrial areas (500SLg/m3). Air quality at the CEP and worker/
resettlement colonies is in compliance with the appropriate standards in all
seasons except pre-monsoon season when periodic excursions do occur. Day time
and night time noise levels around the CHP occasionally exceed the limit for
industrial areas. Noise levels in the quarry, REHM workshop and colony areas
are in compliance with standards.



- 259 -
DIsturbed land reclamation
The total area of external overburden dumps to date is 148ha (75ha inac-
tive and 73ha active dumps). External dumps have outer slopes of 350 to 400 and
heights varying from 45-50m. Dump material consists of a mixture of rock and
friable sandy loam soil. Extensive tree planting has been done on external
overburden dumps. However, except for the flat dump tops, there has been only
50% survival on these steeply sloping, coarse textured erodible spoils.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
Air quality impacts from a number of industrial operations in the Korba
field, particularly coal mining and power generation, now necessitates a re-
gional approach to monitoring and management of environmental ingredients.
Environmental management programmes 1995-1996 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The existing four air monitoring stations are considered adequate. As
for the frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24 hourly
basis for two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending on pollution
load. Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which
will be complied with after its notification. Three more water quality sam-
pling stations will be added to include a discharge point at a new settling
pond where run-off water from external overburden dumps is to be collected and
the ambient stations on the upstream and downstream of Hasdeo River. In all,
there will be nine water quality monitoring stations. Quarterly measurement of
the water level in a well at Gevra Basti will be taken. Current noise level
monitoring at three stations is considered adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 2.5km of garland drains in 1995-96, 1.5km in 1996-97, lkm
in 1997-98, lkm in 1998-99 and lkm in 1999-2000 will be constructed to collect
runoff from the cuter slopes of the external overburden dumps and convey it to
the four new settling ponds. Two settling ponds will be constructed in 1995-96
and two in 1996-97.
Air quality and noise management
About 100,000 trees will be planted along the coal transport road and
around the colony and infrastructure during 1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air qual-
ity improvement and to act as a noise barrier. Results will be monitored care-

Disturbed land reclamation
An engineering study is proposed to be conducted for slope stability of
the overburden dumps during 1995-96 and 1996-97. Depending on the outcome of
the study, if required, these dumps may be resloped to stable angle by rehan-
dling. Overburden, if found stable, will be developed by biological reclama-
tion. A programme will be made for reclamation of old dumps on the basis of
the study report. Reclamation of internal dumps will continue.

MANIKPUR
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine:   Manikpur
Company:   SECL
State:    Madhya Pradesh
Coalfield:    Korba
Year of sanction:    1978
Operational startup:    1978
Type of mine:    Opencast
Mining method:    Truck & shovel
Current production:    1.94 million tonnes
Capacity:    1.24 million tonnes
Mine life:    35 years
Residual life:    18 years
Number of coal seams:    1 (Thickness: 23.7-27.9m)
Ash content:   40%
Strip ratio:    2:1
Max. quarry depth:    82m
coal destination:    MPEB, Korba West Bank TPS
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Manikpur mine is situated on a gently undulating terrain with eleva-
tions ranging between 270m and 290m above sea level. Rapakhara nallah and
Kachandi nallah flow northeast to west over the coal bearing area of this
block and ultimately meet the Hasdeo river, which is adjacent to the mining
lease area and is a perennial tributary of Mahanadi river flowing north to
south, forming the main drainage outlet of the region. A residential colony is
situated 2km from the active mine area but within the mining leasehold. The
nearest village is Dadar, situated to the northeast, outside the mining lease
area. Prior to mining, the leasehold area of 1651.8ha consisted of 883.7ha
agricultural land, 107.6ha Government land, 22ha of home sites, 25.2ha of
water bodies and 613.3ha of degraded and shrub land used for rough grazing and
fuel wood production.
Baseline data
No baseline data is available for this project because it pre-dates the
environmental legislation.



- 264 -
Mine planning and design
The mine is situated on the southern part of Korba coalfields, which
contains predominantly argillaceous rocks interspersed with thick coal hori-
zons. The mine was initially designed for a rated output of 1.0 million tonnes
per annum and started in 1966. In June 1976, a feasibility report for the
Manikpur expansion project was prepared; it was approved by Government of
India in December 1978 for a rated output of 2.0 million tonnes per annum. The
mine was developed as four separate pits because of faults and a major railway
line. Overburden and coal are removed by shovel and dumper combination, since
the start of the mine. Maximum backfilling in the project is envisaged. Coal
is currently hauled by truck about 4km to a rail head situated within the
mining lease area. Areas of leasehold that will be occupied by mine facilities
to the end of current five year (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the
total 45 years mine life are as follows:
Leasehold area - Manikpur

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started in the winter season of 1994. Air
quality readings are taken at three stations: adjacent to the main haul road
near the power sub station, in the active pit quarry near the pit office, and
in the residential colony. Water quality is monitored at the mine sump and its
discharge point. Noise readings are taken day and night at two stations: the
pit office adjacent to the main haul road and residential colony.
Hydrology and water quality manayement
Mine water is collected in mine sumps. Positive discharge from sump
occurs during the monsoon and has regularly been in compliance with discharge
standards. Out of a total of 15,BOOm of garland drains, 1,215m around overbur-
den dumps, 3,300m around the quarry and 5,000m on the sides of haul roads have
been constructed to control runoff. In addition, 4km of garland drains around
back fill area have been constructed. Settling ponds have not yet been con-
structed to control and treat runoff from the external overburden dumps. The
coal handling plant, workshop and vehicle washing areas have, as yet, no waste
water treatment facilities.



- 265 -
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate matter in the mine quarry exceeds the standards of
500g/m2. Noise levels around the quarry and residential colony areas are in
compliance with the standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
The total area of external overburden dumps is 186ha with outer slopes
of 35°-40° and maximum heights of 35m. Dump materials consist of a mixture of
sand stone and friable sandy soil. External overburden dumps are being planted
with trees with the technical support of Madhya Pradesh Forest Development
Corporation. The survival rate is about 80% and the trees are growing well.
These measures will continue and it is envisaged that all the external dumps
will be re-sloped, sown with grasses and legumes and planted with trees and
shrubs during the project mine life.
Regional cumulative environmental impact.;
Air quality impacts from a number of industrial operations in the Korba
field, particularly coal mining and power generation now necessitate a re-
gional approach to monitoring and management of environmental ingredients.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
One air monitoring station will be established in addition to the three
air and noise sampling stations at present. As for the frequency of air sam-
pling, the samples will be drawn on a 24 hourly basis for two days in a month
or two days in a quarter, depending on pollution load. Meanwhile, CPCB is
formulating standards for the coal industry which will be complied after its
notification. Five more water quality sampling stations will be included to
take water samples from upstream and downstream of Kachandi nallah of all the
mine discharges, the colony hand-pump and one well each at Rapakera and Dadar
villages. Thus, there will be seven water quality monitoring stations in to-
tal. Quarterly water levels will be measured in one well each of the two vil-
lages. Current noise level monitoring at two stations is considered inadequate
and one more point will be added.
Hydrology and water quality management
Approximately 6km of garland drains will be constructed in 1995-95 to
collect runoff from external dumps, around the quarry and along the haul road
and convey it to a settling pond. Runoff from the CHP, HMM and vehicle wash-



- 266 -
ing areas will also be conveyed to a settling pond after initial treatment to
remove grease and oil.
Air quality and noise management
Two tankers have been provided for spraying water on haul roads. Water
spraying arrangements have also been made for dust suppression in and around
the pit, CHP and plant working areas. About 100,000 trees wiLl be planted
along the coal transport road and around the colony and infrastructure during
1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air quality improvement and to act as noise barrier.
Result will be monitored carefully and if improvements are insufficient,
chemical retardants and fixed spraying systems in specific working areas will
be contemplated in fiscal year 1997-98. In addition to this, metalling of haul
roads (2km per year) is planned every year up to 1999-2000.
Disturbed land reclamation
The current backlog of disturbed areas is 108.9ha which will be re-
claimed at the rate of 43.5ha in 1995-96, 43.5ha in 1996-97, and 21.9ha in
1997-98. In addition, external dumps and backfilled areas created in the above
years will be reclaimed simultaneously. Thus 55.2ha in 1995-96, 55-2ha in
1966-97, 33.3ha in 1977-98, 11.5ha in 1998-99 and 11.7ha in 1999-2000 will be
reclaimed. Thereafter, 11.5ha created by production will be reclaimed every
year till the end of mine life.

Ash content:    22.3%
Working depth:    16-137.8m
Coal destination:    Miscellaneous industrial consumers
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
Bangwar mine is situated on a gently undulating terrain which slopes in
northerly direction to the Belha nallah approximately 20m from mine entry. A
residential colony is about 2km from the mine. In addition, two villages -
Bemhori and Bangwar - are located to the south of the mine area but outside
the leasehold, each approximately 5 to 6km from the active mining area. Prior
to mining, the leasehold area of 550ha consisted of 29.5ha of dry agricultural
land, 513.3ha of forest and shrub land used for rough grazing and fuel wood
production and 7.3ha of water bodies.
Baseline data
No baseline data is available for this project because its sanction
predates the environmental legislation.
Mine planning and design
The project is an underground mine and has three coal seams, namely VII,
VI top and VI bottom, dipping northerly towards Belha nallah. Coal winning is
done by side discharge loaders and load haul dumpers and transport is effected
with conveyor and rope haulages below ground and coal dispatch by railway.

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring has been carried out since the winter season of
1991. Air quality readings are taken at five stations, i.e. around mine site
office, fan house, mine canteen, residential colony and nearby Bemhori vil-
lage. The water quality stations are at five stations, i.e. mine discharge
point, upstream and downstream of Ghugara nallah, bore well of residential
colony and well at Bemhori village. Water level of a well in Behmori village
is also being observed. Noise readings are taken day and night at 5 stations
i.e. workshop, CHP, Manager's office, residential colony and Bemhori village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in large capacity sumps underground. Clear water
from these sumps is pumped through the forest to natural water courses. Water
quality has regularly been in compliance with discharge standards. The mini
caP and workshop have, as yet, no waste water treatment facilities.
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate matters around the mine premises is within the
limits for Industrial areas, i.e. 500g/m3. Air quality parameters at all the
reading stations are regularly in compliance with the appropriate standards.
Day and night time noise levels are regularly in compliance with the stan-
dards. Extensive tree plantation has been done in and around the mine area, in
the colony and both sides of the coal transportation road for the improvement
of the environment in general.
Disturbed lard reclamation
Land has not been disturbed due to subsidence, as depillaring operation
has not yet been started.



- 271 -
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
There is no other industry in the area, so there is no regional cumula-
tive environmental impact.
Environmental management pregrames 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
The existing five air quality monitoring stations are considered ad-
equate. As for frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24
hourly basis for two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending on
the pollution load. Meanwhile, CPCE is formulating standards for the coal
industry which will be complied with after its notification. Five existing
water quality monitoring stations are considered adequate. Noise monitoring
programmes at existing five stations are also considered adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
As there is sumpage for mine water underground, the construction of
settling tanks for mine discharge is not required. A settling pond will be
constructed in 1996-97 to which effluents from CHP, workshop and vehicle wash-
ing area will be conveyed after initial treatment to remove grease and oil.
Air quality and noise management
One water sprinkler of 10kl capacity will be acquired during 1995-96 and
will be used primarily along the internal coal transportation road and CHP. In
addition, 100,000 trees will be planted during next 5 years at the rate of
20,000 trees per year, along road sides and infrastructural areas. Results
will be monitored carefully and if improvements are insufficient, a fixed
spraying system in specific working areas will be contemplated from the fiscal
year 1997-98.
Disturbed land reclamation
Land has not been disturbed due to subsidence, as depillaring operation
has not yet been started. Subsidence will be monitored after the start of
depillaring operations. Leveling and terracing will be done in subsidence
troughs and tree planting will be done around these troughs. From 1997-98
onwards, 17ha of subsided land will become available per year which will be
reclaimed at an average cost of Rs.30,000 per hectare for land restoration,
greening and soil conservation etc.

Current environental status
Environmental setting
The Behraband mine is situated on an undulating terrain which slopes
very gently in southeast direction towards Kanhai river adjacent to the bound-
ary of the mine. A residential colony is situated 5km in a southeasterly di-
rection from the mine boundary. In addition to this, one established village
named Benibahra is located to northeast about 3km away from the pit site.
Prior to mining, the leasehold area of 600ha consisted of 179.5ha of village
land, 186ha of agricultural land and 234.5ha of non-agricultural land.
'Baseline data
Baseline data for 1990-91 is available for this project. Air stations
were fixed at Sagnotola village near Kanhai nallah, Benibahara village, Katka
Dongaria village and Kudri village. SPM levels were 242pg/m3 and 267ig/m3 dur-
ing post monsoon and winter seasons respectively near Sagnotola village. Simi-
larly, at Kudri village SPM levels were 281, 211 and 257 during pre-monsoon,
monsoon and winter seasons, respectively. Noise levels measured at the above
stations were within the prescribed limit. Water samples were taken at
Behraband incline discharge, up and downstream of Kanhai nallah, Sagnotola
pond and Bijuri mine discharge. Coliform was found to be present in the water
of Kanhai nallah. Other parameters were within prescribed limits.



- 276 -
Mine planning and design
The project is an underground mine with one coal seam that dips gently
at a slope of 1 in 14 from north to south. The mine has two inclines and a
shaft, the latter one not yet completed. It is planned to drive a third in-
cline in order to have separate inclines for men, material and coal clearance.
Mechanised bord and pillar mining by deploying side discharge loaders (SDL)
and chain conveyors, are proposed. Manual loading is proposed where seam
thickness is less than 2m and loading by SDL onto chain conveyor where the
thickness is more than 2m. The target production is to be achieved by operat-
ing five mechanised panels/districts. Coal production is currently hauled by
belt conveyor from underground to surface and transported by trucks to dis-
tance of 6.5km from the mine site to a rail loading facility at the CHP of
Bijuri mine. The total area of leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the
end of current five year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the
total 25 years of mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started in January 1994. Air quality read-
ings are taken at two stations, i.e. around the air shaft and Bhagta village.
Four water quality stations are at the mine discharge, a well in Bhagta vil-
lage, and upstream and downstream of Kanhai river. Noise readings are taken
day and night at three stations, i.e. around the CHP, mine exhaust and in
Bhagta village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a large standage capacity sump underground.
After sedimentation, it is discharged regularly in compliance with discharge
standards-into surface channels. The CHP, work shop and vehicle washing area
have, as yet, no waste water treatment facilities.
Air quality and noise management

time and night time noise levels around mine exhaust, CHP and village area are
regularly in compliance with standards.
Disturbed land reclamtion
No land subsidence is expected, hence land reclamation is not required.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
There is no other industry in the area, so no regional cumulative envi-
ronmental impact is envisaged.
Environrental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
In addition to the two existing air quality monitoring stations, one
more station will be established. As for frequency of air sampling, the
samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for two days in a month or two days
in a quarter, depending on the pollution load. Meanwhile, the CPCB is formu-
lating standards for the coal industry which will be complied with after its
notification. Four water quality sampling stations are considered adequate.
Water level will be measured quarterly at two domestic village wells one each
in Bhagta and Benibahra village. Present noise monitoring programmes at three
stations are considered adequate.
Hydrology and water quality management
A settling tank will be designed and constructed by December 1995.
Grease and oil traps will be constructed for waste water treatment from work-
shop and vehicle washing area by 1995-96. After initial treatment to remove
grease and oil, the effluent will be released to a settling pond that will be
constructed by 1995-96.
Air quality and noise management
One water tanker will be acquired in 1995-96. This will be used prima-
rily along the road to suppress dust in and around the village area. About
100,000 trees will be planted along the coal transport road, around the colony
and infrastructure during 1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air quality improvement and
to act as a noise barrier. Result will be monitored carefully and if improve-
ments are insufficient, chemical retardants and a fixed spraying system will
be completed in specific areas in fiscal year 1996-97.

Ash content:    18-22%
Working depth:    55-260m
Coal destination:    Miscellaneous industrial consumers
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The surface of the mine area is hilly and slopes to the south and west
(770m to 700m above mean sea level). The drainage is by natural slope and
through various nallahs to Jhumka water reservoir, approximately 3km away on
the west from the mine incline. A residential colony and some of the mine
infrastructure are located on flat terrain downhill from the mine site. There
are three villages Anandpur, Katghori and Sirpur which are located to the
northeast of the mine area at approximately 3km from the active mine area.
Piior to mining, the leasehold area of 557.8ha consisted of 15.3ha agricul-
tural land, 0.7ha Govt. land and 541.8ha forest land, used for timber and fuel
wood production.
Baseline data
Baseline data is not available for this project because this is an ex-
tension of Churcha Main mine, which pre-dates the environmental legislation.
mine planning and design
The project is an underground mine and consists of only one workable
coal seam, dipping almost due north. The seam gradient varies from 1 in 10 to
1 in 18. Coal winning is being done by bord and pillar method with side dis-

charge loaders (SDLs). Coal is blasted off the solid and is loaded by SDLs on
Pony conveyors. Belt conveyors are being used for trunk transportation. Coal
is transported from mine top to the CHP by surface belt conveyors and then
transported by railway wagons. The total area of leasehold occupied by mine
facilities to the end of current five year period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and
anticipated to the total 25 years of mine life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
continuous environmental monitoring was started in the monsoon season of
1993. Air quality readings are taken at four stations, i.e. near mine site
office, vocational training centre, residential colony and Sirpur village.
Four water quality stations are the mine discharge, colony drinking water
before and after treatment, and Sirpur village well. Noise readings are taken
at four stations, i.e. the project office, VTC, residential colony and Sirpur
village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in the mine sump and pumped out on the surface
to discharge through a settling tank to the nearby Gagargodi nallah and fi-
nally to Jhumka water reservoir. Positive discharge from the final sump occurs
only during the height of monsoon season and has regularly been in compliance
with discharge standards excepting low pH value. The coal handling plant has
been provided with a settling pond. Workshop and vehicle washing areas have,
as yet, no waste water treatment facilities.
Air quality and noise management
Air quality at all the four reading stations is in compliance with the
appropriate standards. Noise level at the four stations is also regularly in
compliance with standards.



- 283 -
Disturbed land reclamation
Since no subsidence has yet taken place there is no need for land recla-
mation at present.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
'rhere is no industry nearby, so no regional cumulative environmental
impact is envisaged.
Envi:onmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Four each of air, water and noise sampling stations are considered ad-
equate. As to the frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on 24
hourly basis for two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending upon
the pollution load. Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating a standard for the coal
industry. This will be complied with after its notification. Quarterly mea-
surements of water level will be taken in a well of Sirpur village. The cur-
rent noise monitoring programme at four stations is considered adequate.
Hydrology and vater quality management
An acid treatment plant will be constructed by the end of 1996-97 to
improve pH value and bring it into compliance with the statutory standards. An
oil and grease trap cum settling pond will be constructed in the year 1995-96.
Air quality and noise management
In addition to the planting already done on all the available land, a
further 100,000 (approx.) trees will be planted along the coal transport road,
around the colony and infrastructure, during 1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air
quality improvement and to act as a noise barrier. Current water spraying
arrangements in CHP and cover of conveyor belt will be maintained. Results
will be monitored carefully and, if needed, further dust suppression measures
will be taken at specific areas in fiscal year 1997-98. Current noise level
management is considered adequate.
Disturbed land reclamation
Since surface land will not be disturbed by subsidence no reclamation is
necessary.

KURJA
FIVE YEAR ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION PLAN
Mine:    Kurja
Company:    SECL
State:    Madhya Pradesh
Coalfield:    Hasdeo
Year of sanction:    1988
Operational startup:    1989
Type of mine:    Underground
Mining method:    Bord a Pillar
Current production:    0.13 million tonnes
Capacity:    0.40 million tonnes
Mine life:    20 years
Residual life:    17 years
Number of coal seams:    1 (Thickness: 1.2-2.5m)
Ash content:    10.7-28.7%
Working depth:    102-185m
Coal destination:    Miscellaneous industrial consumers
Current environmental status
Environmental setting
The Kurja mine is situated on an undulating terrain which slopes very
gently in a westerly direction towards Kewai river which is approximately 8km
from the boundary of the mine. A workers colony is situated 4km north of the
mine boundary. In addition, two villages, Daldal and Parsapani, are located ir.
the east within the leasehold approximately 1.5-2km from the active mine area.
Prior to mining, the leasehold area of 469ha consisted of 20.5ha of village
land and 448.5ha of dry agricultural land.
Baseline data
Baseline data from 1988 is available for this project. Air stations were
fixed at the proposed mine site, Chanwaridand village, Bahiatola village and
near Rajnagar stadium. SPM levels exceed the prescribed limit at all the sta-
tions in pre-monsoon season. Noise levels measured at these stations are found
to be within the threshold limit. Water samples were collected in all seasons
from 16 points including wells, village ponds and up and downstream of Hasdeo
river, and analysed. Except the presence of coliform in some samples, all
parameters were within prescribed limits.



- 288 -
Mine planning and design
The project is an underground mine and consists of one coal seam that
dips gently at 1 in 29 in an easterly direction from Kewai river on the west-
ern side. Entry has been by a pair of inclines. After reaching the coal seam,
the main trunk development is in progress. Conventional bord and pillar mining
is proposed with manual shoveling onto a chain conveyor where seam thickness
is less than 2m. Loading by side discharge loader (SDL) onto chain conveyor is
envisaged where seam thickness is more than 2m. The production is to be
achieved by operating three mechanised and one manual panels. Coal production
is currently hauled by belt conveyor from underground to surface and trans-
ported by trucks 8-10km from the mine site to the rail line loading facility
at the Rajnagar new CHP and West Jhagrakhand CHP, respectively. The total area
of the leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the current five year period
(1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total 20 years of mine life are
as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Regular environmental monitoring was started in October 1993. Air qual-
ity readings are taken at two stations (the mine office area and Parsapani
village). Four water quality stations are at mine discharge, a well in
Paraspani village and upstream and downstream of a nearby seasonal nallah.
Noise readings are taken day and night at three stations (around the CUP and
mine exhaust and at Paraspani village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a large capacity sump underground and is
discharged into surface drainage. No surface settling tank is required to be
constructed for mine water. The coal handling plant, workshop and vehicle
washing areas have, as yet, no waste water treatment facilities. The effluents
from these will be guided, treated and then reused and/or discharged.



- 289 -
Air quality and noise management
Suspended particulate matter levels in mine office area and Paraspani
village are regularly in compliance with appropriate standards. Day and night
time noise levels are regularly in compliance with the standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
Because no land subsidence is expected, land reclamation is not in-
volved.
Regional cumulative environmental impacts
There is no other industry in the area, hence no regional cumulative
environmental impact is envisaged.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999 2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
In addition to the two existing air quality monitoring stations, one
more station will be established. As for frequency of air sampling, the
samples will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for two days in a month or two days
in a quarter, depending on pollution load. Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating
standards for the coal industry which will be complied with after its notifi-
cation. one more water quality sampling station at Daldal village domestic
well will be added in 1995, bringing the total to five. Quarterly water levels
will be measured in domestic wells at Paraspani and Daldal village. The cur-
rent quarterly monitoring of the full range of parameters will continue. The
present noise monitoring programme at the three stations is considered ad-
equate.
Hydrology and water quality management
As explained earlier, there is provision of sumpage in underground and
only clarified water is pumped out. No settling pond is required at the sur-
face. A system of oil and grease traps will be constructed for waste water
treatment from the workshop and vehicle washing area by 1996-97. After initial
treatment to remove oil and grease the effluent will be released to another
settling pond, to be constructed by 1995-96, to clarify the effluent before
discharge.



- 290 -
Air quality and noise management
One water tanker will be acquired in 1996-97. This will be ased prima-
rily along the road with particular attention to the road section near Daldal
village to suppress the dust in and around the village area. About 100,000
plants will be planted along the coal transport road, and around the colony
and infrastructure from 1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air quality improvement and
to act as a noise barrier. Results will be monitored carefully and if improve-
ments are insufficient, chemical retardants and fixed spraying system will be
contemplated in specific areas in fiscal year 1996-97.
Disturbed land reclamation
No land up to 1999-2000 is expected to be disturbed by depillaring, so
no reclamation is necessary.

and 1013.3ha of forest land used for wood and fuel wood production.
Baseline data
Baseline data of 1988 is available for this project. Readings were taken
for air and noise levels at four stations. Similarly water samples were taken
from four points. The air, noise and water levels were within the prescribed
limits.
Mine planning and design
Pandavpara is an underground project and consists of two workable coal
seams (Seam III and Seam II). The gradient of the seams varies from 1 in 6 to
1 in 24 dipping from south to north. Seam III has been entered by a pair of
inclines and Seam II will be approached by cross measure drifts. The project

is proposed to be worked by bord and pillar method. Coal winning will be done
by blasting off the solid and hand shoveling onto low height coal tubs and
hoisted by endless/direct rope haulages. Coal from Pandavpara project will be
handled by a CHP near the incline. It will be transported to Ratora railway
siding (12km) by truck and then dispatched by railway wagon. The total area of
leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of the current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total 40 years of mine
life are as follows:

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
monitoring of various environmental parameters was started during the
monsoon season of 1994. Four air quality monitoring stations are near the mine
site office, CHP, residential colony and nearby Sorga village. Four water
quality sites are the mine discharge point, office borewell, Sorga village
borewell and downstream of Kolha nallah. Noise readings are taken day and
night at four stations: the CHP, residential colony, Ihond village and Sorga
village.
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in the mine sump after sedimentation and is
pumped out to discharge through a drain to Kulaha nallah. It has regularly
been in compliance with discharge standards. The coal handling plant and mini
workshop have, as yet, no waste water treatment facilities.
Air quelity and noise management
Air quality as well as noise levels at all the four reading stations are
in compliance with standards.
Disturbed land reclamation
Since no subsidence has yet taken place, no land reclamation is neces-
sary.



- 295 -
Regional cumulative environmental impact
There is no other indust-y near the project area, so no regional cumula-
tive environmental impact is envisaged.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 1999-2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Four air and noise sampling stations are considered adequate. As for
frequency of air sampling, a sample will be drawn on 24 hourly basis for two
days in a month or two days in quarter depending on pollution load. Meanwhile,
CPCB is formulating standards for the coal industry which will be complied
with after its notification. Three more water quality sampling stations will
be added from 1995 to include upstream of Kolha nallah, colony water supply
treatment plant and a well at Khond village. Thus, the total number of sta-
tions will be seven. Quarterly water level measurements will be taken in the
well of Khond village. Current noise monitoring programmes at four stations
are considered adequate.
Eydrology and water quality management
A settling tank will be constructed by 1995-96 to treat mine water which
will be conveyed to a filter plant for use in the colony. A garland drain lOOm
in length will be constructed by December 1995 to collect run off from the CHP
and convey it to a settling pond. Runoff from the workshop and vehicle washing
areas will pass through an oil and grease trap which will be constructed by
December 1996. This will then be conveyed to the new settling pond.
Air quality and noise management
One new water tanker will be acquired in 1995-96 to be used to upgrade
the level of dust suppression in and around the project area. About 100,000
trees will be planted along the coal transport road and around the colony and
infrastructure during 1995-96 to 1999-2000 for air quality improvement and to
act as a noise barrier. Fixed water spraying arrangements at the coal handling
plant will be made by December 1996. Results will be monitored carefully and
if so needed, further dust suppression measures will be taken at specific
areas in fiscal year 1997-98. Current noise level management is considered
adequate.
Disturbed land reclamation
No land up to the year 1999-2000 is expected to be disturbed due to
subsidence, so no reclamation is necessary.

Current environmental status
Environmental setting
inghali project is located on almost flat terrain with elevations rang-
ing  j .m, 296-318m above sea level. Hasdeo river, with its tributary Kholar
nallah flowing in a southerly direction adjacent to the mine boundary, forms
the main drainage of the area. Two villages, Arda and Bheginara are located to
the north and southeastern part of the mine area. Both are outside the
leasehold area. While Bheginara village is located adjacent to the mine
project site, Arda village is located about 3km from the mining area. Prior to
mining, leasehold area of 862.3ha consisted of 246.2ha of agricultural land,
314.6ha Govt. land and 301.5ha of degraded forest and shrub land used for
rough grazing and fuel wood production. of this, 57.4ha of land has been ac-
quired for the construction of the mine facilities.
Baseline data
Baseline data from 1990-91 is available for this project. Air stations
were fixed at the proposed incline site, Jawali village, Harabhata village and
Dhabdhab village. Air quality at all stations, in all seasons, was found to be
within the prescribed limit. Noise levels measured at these stations were
within the threshold limit. Water samples were drawn from local nallah of
Bhejinara village, up and down stream of Kholar nallah and Banki mine dis-



- 300 -
charge. Faecal contamination was found in samples of Iholar nallah and Banki
mine discharge. Other parameters were within permissible limits.
Mine planning and design
The project is an underground mine and consists of one workable coal
seam that dips gently in a southerly direction. The method of mining is bord
and pillar with caving system. Coal production is yet to start. Loading of cut
coal will be by side discharge loaders and face transport will be by chain
conveyor, endless haulage and belt conveyors. Coal produced will be trans-
ported by trucks 5-6km to a rail head, located at Banki Colliery. The total
area of leasehold occupied by mine facilities to the end of current five year
period (1995-96 to 1999-2000) and anticipated to the total 48 years of mine
life, are as follows:
Leasehold area - Singhali
(All figures In hectares)
Infrastructure    Colonies C villages    Unoccupied  Total area
S years            57.4               0.0             804.9           862.3

Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Environmental monitoring was started in the winter season of 1994. Air
quality readings are taken at two stations (adjacent to the project office and
at the project colony). Water quality stations are at two places (mine dis-
charge from Incline No.1 and II and a nearby pond). Noise readings are taken
day and night at two stations (at the project office and in the colony).
Hydrology and water quality management
Mine water is collected in a settling tank and the clear water is dis-
charged through the drain into the tributary of Kholar nallah and has been in
compliance with discharge standards. The workshop and vehicle washing areas
have, as yet, no water treatment facilities.
Air quality and noise management
Air quality at existing two reading stations is regularly in compliance
with the standards. The noise levels at two stations are also regularly in
compliance with standards.



- 301 -
Disturbed land reclamation
For the first nine years of project life, no depillaring operations are
envisaged, so no reclamation is necessary up to the year 2000. A portion of
the area which was damaged due to construction of mine entry, service build-
ings, approach roads and drains has been fully reclaimed and planting over 2ha
of land has been completed.
Regional cumulative environmental Impacts
No other industry is nearby, so regional cumulative environmental impact
is not envisaged.
Environmental management programmes 1995-96 to 2000
Project monitoring, auditing and evaluation
Current air and noise sampling stations are considered inadequate.
Hence, one additional air and noise observation station will be established
during 1995-96. As for frequency of air sampling, the samples will be drawn on
24 hourly basis for two days in a month or two days in a quarter, depending
upon the pollution load. Meanwhile, CPCB is formulating standards for the coal
industry which will be complied with after its notification. Water quality
sampling stations will include one well each in Singhali village and
Harrabhata village. In place of water samples from Inclines I and II and the
pond, samples from mine discharge after treatment in settling tank and one
each from upstream and downstream of Kholar nallah will be taken. So from
1995-96, water sampling stations will be five in number. Quarterly water lev-
els in these two wells will also be measured.
Hydrology and water quality management
Runoff from the workshop and vehicle washing areas will be conveyed to
the drains constructed for outflow of settling tank after initial treatment to
remove grease and oil. This drain will be made of brick masonry in the year
1995-96. A water sump will be created inside the mine by the year 1995-96 for
mine discharge. Thus, clearer water will be discharged through the settling
tank. Drinking water facilities will be extended by December 1996 to the
adopted villages, Arda and Bheginara.
Air quality and noise management
The coal transport roads have been metalled from the mine site to the
railhead at Banki. It is also planned to widen the Banki-Suttara road to fa-
cilitate coal movement and to restrict air pollution. A fixed water spraying



- 302 -
arrangement at the CHP will be made by December 1995. Social forestry is
planned on Sha of waste land near Bheginara and Arda villages to combat the
air and noise pollution. In addition, 100,000 trees will be planted during
next five years at the rate of 20,000 trees per year, along road sides and
infrastructural areas. Results will be monitored carefully and if improvements
are insufficient water spraying will be contemplated on roads near to the
villages by 1997-98.
Disturbed land reclamation
Damage to land surface due to subsidence has not been predicted, so no
land reclamation is necessary up to the year 2000.

ANNEX 7 ISSUES RAISED DURING CONSULTATIONS ON EAPS
(A REPORT ON THE WORKSHOP HELD AT HOTEL HINDUSTAN INTERNATIONAL ON 27TH AND
28TH OF MAY 1995)
Introduction
A workshop was held in Calcutta on 27 and 28 May, 1995 to discuss with
project-affected people and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the draft
report on the 'Sectoral Environmental Assessment' for the Coal Sector Reha-
bilitation Project and the subproject specific Five-year Environmental Action
Plans prepared by Coal India for submission to the World Bank.
Shri U. Kumar, Chairman, Managing Director, SECL opened the workshop by
describing in detail the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project and the benefits
it would bring to the coal industry and to the people in and around the 31
subprojects, as well as the mitigational measures for possible adverse effects
on the environment due to the operation of coal mines. This was done to brief
the NGOs and project-affected people about the project.
The NC-Os and project-affected people took active interest in the presen-
tations that Coal India officials (Dr. S.X. Ghosh, Advisor, Coal India and
Shri S.K. Varma, Chief General Manager (WBP)) made on different aspects of the
Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project such as India's energy scenario, Coal
India's responsibility and commitment to produce additional coal within the
next five years to bridge the gap between demand and supply, mobilisation of
funds through a loan from the World Bank in view of the Government's decision
not to give any more funding to Coal India, and the fact that if constraints
for mobilisation of funding are not removed, a declining trend of coal produc-
tion will inevitably set in. The project-affected people and the NGOs present
in the workshop unanimously supported the move taken by Coal India to take
this loan for the Coal Sector Rehabilitation Project.
Coal India officials (Shri V.K. Singh, Chief General Manager (Environ-
ment) and Shri H.P. Roy, General Manager (Resettlement and Rehabilitation)
also presented the draft Sectoral Environmental Assessment. They elucidated
adverse effects on the environment (including social, occupational health and
safety matters) due to coal mining operations and Coal India's proposal to
implement the mitigational measures in a time bound programme within the next
five years, to reduce these effects. This was explained to the congregation
with the aim to invite suggestions, if any, from the NGOs and project-affected
people for improvement of the environment in the 31 subprojects of the Coal
Sector Rehabilitation Project.

Annex 7
Page 2 of 4
The subproject specific Five Year Environmental Action Plans for the 31 sub-
projects presented by Shri A.N. Kheto, General Manager (Environment) generated
a lot of interest and the gather subdivided into six groups to discuss the
following issues:
* water pollution and hydrology,
* air quality, noise pollution and blasting vibration,
* afforestation and land reclamation,
* resettlement of villages,
* rehabilitation of project-affected people, and
* occupational health and safety.
overvLew of the workshop
The workshop was attended by about 50 participants (NGOs, project-af-
fected people and officers of Coal India and its subsidiary coal companies).
All the representatives of NGOs and project-affected people were indi-
vidually invited to speak on the environmental issues concerning them. In
addition six groups were formed for group discussion on the specialised topics
listed above.
Many new ideas emerged on environmental issues, and slippages in imple-
mentation of EMPs were also noted. The resettlement and rehabilitation of
project-affected people is very much inter-related to environmental issues.
All the particpants felt that more active participation of project-affected
people in planning, implementation and monitoring of the resettlement and
rehabilitation and environmental protection activities can not only lead to a
more effective implementation, but also lessen the misunderstandings that
exist between Coal India officials and project-affected people.
Recommendations of group discussions on the environmental issues
Following are the important recommendations which emerged during the
group discussions on the six specialised issues.
Water pollution and hydrology
a.) An awareness campaign (including leaflets in local languages) should
be launched to educate project-affected people about the various
aspects of water pollution and treatment. Periodic monitoring should
be completed and suitability of the water for drinking and irriga-
tion should be included (in writing) along with the test results.
Project-affected people should be involved in the monitoring
programme.
b.) The availability of underground and surface water should be scien-
tifically ascertained before selecting any resettlement site. An



- 307 -
Page 3 of 4
action plan for safe drinking and irrigation water should be pre-
pared and implemented in the selected sites.
c.) Water conservation measures should be adopted for specific site
conditions.
d.) Model farms and pisciculture on nearby areas using discharged water
from mines should be promoted. This would increase the confidence of
project-affected people and promote viable economic activity.
Air/noise pollution and blasting vIbration
a.) An awareness campaign should also be launched for educating project-
affztfed people about the noise and air pollution issues and the
steps taken to minimise or contain them. Periodic monitoring should
be done and Coal India officials should be encouraged to share the
results with project-affected people.
b.) Periodic health camps should be organised in areas affected by noise
and air pollution for medical check-ups that include lung related
diseases.
c.) Tree planting should be encouraged in and around the villages to
minimise the effects of noise and air pollution. Planting fruit
trees and bamboo can be promoted because of the economic benefits
associated with them.
d.) Transport roads should be metalled and cleaned regularly to minimise
dust pollution.
Afforestation and land reclamation
a.) Regular monitoring of top soil conditions on reclaimed land should
be done to ascertain its capacity to support vegetation.
b.) Agro-forestry involving indigenous tree species, which are more
suited to local conditions, should be promoted and should serve as
common property resources for project-affected people.
c.) Grass can be planted on slopes to prevent soil erosion. Leguminous
cropping can be completed between tree plantings to increase nitro-
gen fixation.
d.) Opencast voids, reservoirs and other water harvesting techniques
should be utilised for using mine discharge water in irrigating
plantations.
Resettlement of villages
a.) An awareness campaign should be launched to publicise the resettle-
ment and rehabilitation policies of Coal India and the Government.
b.) Representative bodies of project-affected people should be involved
in the selection of resettlement sites. As mentioned earlier, stud-
ies should be conducted regarding the availability of water and the
fertility of the soil before finalising the site.



- 308 -
Anrex 7
Page 4 of 4
c.) As far as practicable, entire blocks of villages should be acquired
together to prevent fragmentation of holdings or assets of project-
affected people. All acquired villages in a region should be re-
settled simultaneously to avoid adverse impacts of inflation on
compensation money.
d.) The compensation for the project-affected person's building should
be at replacement cost and verified by an independent agency in
addition to Coal India.
RehabIlItatIon of project-affected people
The project-affected people should be involved in the initial stage of plan-
ning as well as the implementation of the rehabilitation process.
a.) The objective of rehabilitation should not only be to regain the
former standard of living, but to improve upon it.
b.) Regarding the issue of 'compensation for land and selection for
jobs,' Coal India should deal directly with a representative body of
project-affected people. Since only one member of the family is
entitled to a job, often it causes bad blood in the family.
c.) The baseline survey required to prepare a detailed resettlement and
rehabilitation plan for each family should be standardised across
all Coal India projects. The survey should be action oriented, not
purely academic.
d.) The project-affected person should be assimilated into the host
community. This requires a sample baseline survey of the host commu-
nity and some measures adopted to improve its standard of living.
e.; Coal India should devise attractive area-specific self-employment
opportunities so that the pressure on receiving jobs can be reduced.
These shou.d include skill upgradation, finance and marketing.
Occupational health and safety
a.) Occupational health and safety should not only cover mine workers,
but other people living in the impact zone.
b.) An awareness campaign should be launched in the impact area regard-
ing various detrimental effects on health from mining and adopting
safety procedures for them.
c.) Periodic health check-ups (three years) should be arranged more
frequently and include tuberculosis and liver, lung and kidney re-
lated diseases.

ANNEX 8 RESETTLEMENT AND REHABILITATION POLICY OF COAL INDIA
Preamble
1.    The location and quality of coal reserves, and their distance from major
consumers, determine to a great extent the selection of mine sites. For re-
serves that are close to the surface, opencast mining has proven to be the
most efficient mining method. While relatively inexpensive, opencast mines
require large areas of land. Population growth, particularly in India's east-
ern region, make it increasingly difficult for the subsidiary coal companies
(subsidiaries) to acquire the land they need for expanding their operations.
2.    In the past, subsidiaries found it relatively easy to acquire land if
they were able to offer jobs. Partly because of this practice, subsidiaries
have built up a labor force beyond their needs. This has contributed to the
heavy losses many mines incur and has eroded the competitiveness of the coal
industry. The subsidiaries may still need to hire people in selected locations
and continue to give preference to those whose livelihood will be affected by
coal mining operations, however subsidiaries will need to develop other ways
and means to compensate land owners and others adversely affected by their
projects. Only proper resettlement and rehabilitation will elicit the coopera-
tion of project-affected people, and make it possible for Coal India to ac-
quire the land it needs.
3.    The purpose of this statement is to set out the basic principles for the
resettlement and rehabilitation of people affected by coal mining projects. As
such, this statement attempts to streamline the different resettlement and
rehabilitation practices that are being followed by subsidiaries and modify
them in a way that allows subsidiaries to deal more effectively with resettle-
ment and rehabilitation issues.
4.    while Coal India's basic philosophy for compensating land losers and
other project-affected people remains substantially unchanged, the statement
emphasizes the need to cultivate and maintain good relationships with the
people affected by Coal India's projects as early as possible; it also under-
scores that the subsidiaries have a responsibility towards the landless, whose
livelihood is often taken away. On the other hand, subsidiaries need to pro-
tect themselves more effectively against unjustified claims. To this end, the
statement proposes that subsidiaries prepare detailed Rehabilitation Action
Plans that clearly identify ,at an early stage, the entitlements of the people
affected by coal projects
5.    The resettlement and rehabilitation policies followed by the subsidiar-
ies have evolved over time and undergone numerous changes in response to

Page 2 of 7
changing circumstances. As and when the Central or State Governments issue new
guidelines for resettlement and rehabilitation, Coal India will review and
modify its resettlement and rehabilitation policy taking into account the
changing conditions in coal producing areas. However, as a matter of prin-
ciple, Lhe compensation and benelits offcred to the people affected by coal
projects of Coal India will be at least equal to an; not less than tho-. pre-
scribed by the laws and guidelines of the Central and State Governments. In
any case, Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy has to be ap-
proved by the Ministry of Coal.
Objective of Coal India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy
6.    In light of the growing difficulties many subsidiaries face in land
acquisition, highest priority will be given to avoiding or minimizing distur-
bance of the local population. In their decisions to open new mines or expand
existing ones, subsidiaries will explore alternative sites and project designs
to minimize the need for resettlement. Wherever people are likely to be ad-
versely affected by a project, the subsidiaries will prepare Rehabilitation
Action Plans for the project.
7.    Through the preparation of Rehabilitation Action Plans, subsidiaries
will safeguard that project-affected people improve, or at least regain, their
former standard of living and earning capacity after a reasonable transition
period. The transition period is to be kept to a minimum, however the involve-
ment of subsidiaries in resettlement and rehabilitation activities will con-
tinue until all the actions specified in the Rehabilitation Action Plan have
been completed.
S.    Involuntary resettlement is conceived and executed as a development
program with project-affected people being provided sufficient resources and
opportunities to share in a project's benefits. The efforts of subsidiaries
are complementary to government schemes in rural development. To the extent
that this is necessary, the concurrence, approvals and support from concerned
Government authorities will be sought. In parallel, subsidiaries will work
closely with non-governmental organizations, which are legally recognized and
constituted and have the confidence of the project-affected people, in the
preparation and implementation of Rehabilitation Action Plans.
Definition of project-affected people
9.    Coal India recognizes that the acquisition of land in populated areas
for mining purposes greatly affects the lives and livelihood of the local
population. While the development of new mines brings job opportunities with
the subsidiaries, associated contractors and ancillary industries, it also
eliminates many traditional sources of income. The rehabilitation efforts of

the subsidiaries are designed to integrate the various groups of people af-
fected by the project into the regional development process. The development
of a new mine or expansion of mining activities tends to accelerate this pro-
cess. By informing the potentially affected people, at the earliest possible
stage, about the project and options for resettlement and rehabilitation,
subsidiaries prepare the local population for the changes that are to come and
case Lhe Lranastion tor new lifesty3lz.
10.   It is Coal India's policy to recognize adult individuals as the unit of
entitlement. In their rehabilitation efforts subsidiaries deal with a wide
range of project affected people. They fall into the following categories:
A. Landowners, including those with whom government land is settled:
i.   persons from whom land is acquired including tribals cultivat-
ing land under traditional rights;
ii.  persons whose homestead is acquired; and
iii. persons from whom land and their homestead are acquired.
B. Landless, who derive their livelihood from the land to be acquired
for a minimum of three years prior to the date of notification (of
intention to acquire land)
1.   sharecroppers, land lessees, tenants and day laborers;
ii.  tribals dependent on forest produce; and
iii. persons whose homestead is acquired.
Eligibility and compensation
11.   Table 1 shows the compensation and rehabilitation efforts subsidiaries
will offer for each person or family affected by one of their projects. Evi-
dence that a person is a legitimate project-affected person will need to be
provided in the form of a written legal document or reference to a record,
such as a revenue officer certificate, electoral roll, ration card or school
record.
Rehabilitation efforts
Land for Land (Package B)
12.   In many areas where subsidiaries expand their mining operati-ns, land is
scarce. It has been the experience of tnese companies that few project-af-
fected people opt for acquiring land. Wherever possible and if so desired by
the project-affected person who is a landowner, he will 4.dentify and purchase
land with assistance from the subsidiary. The land and -ts area should be such
so as to provide better, or at least the same, income to the project-affected
person which he was deriving from his original land. The following modalities
will be exercised to assist eligible project affected persons to acquire land,
if they so wish:

i. A project-affected person who chooses this option, will not be en-
titled to any other rehabilitation option. However, shifting allow-
ance, at market rate, to cover the full cost of transportation will
be provided to the persons for moving to the new area; and
ii. he may purchase land on a 'willing buyer-willing seller' basis
within a limited geographic area and specified time period.
Nonfarm self employment (Package C)
13.   For project-affected people who opt for the nonfarm self employment
package, the subsidiary will dssist4 in developing such options as dairy and
poultry production, shops, and petty contracts.
Rehabilitation assistance (Package D)
14.   If none of the other options are available to affected people with less
than two acres of land, the subsidiary would provide rehabilitation assistance
to ensure that the affected people are able to regain their former standard of
living or earning capacity. The assistance would be in the form of a subsis-
tence allowance or a lump sum grant to be used against productive investments.
15.   If the affected person chooses the lump sum grant, it will be calculated
on the same basis as the subsistence allowance. During a three year period
following the preparation of the Rehabilitation Action Plan, the person can
select a productive investment. Until the payment is made, the grant would be
held in an interest bearing account.
Women
16.   Special attempts will be made to ensure that women will be given ad-
equate access to income generating opportunities offered under this policy.
Jobs
17.   Jobs will be given to eligible landless project-affected people on a
preferential basis when outside recruitment becomes necessary.
Community facilities
18.   The subsidiary will provide to the resettlement site a school, road with
street light, 'pucca' drain, pond, dugwell and/or tubewell for drinking water
supply, community center, place of worship, dispensary. grazing land for
cattle and playground. Similar infrastructural facility, if necessary, will be
extended to the host locality. The community facilities and services would be

Mnxa
Page 6 of 7
available to all residents of the area, including the project-affected people
and the host population.
19.   The approach for operation of community facilities would be flexible and
all efforts vill be made to involve the State and local self-Government/
Panchayat for operating the facilities. To achieve this, subsidiaries will
pursue with these agencies to ensure the same. The planning of the community
facilities and the construction should be undertaken in consultation with the
affected community.
Implementation, monitoring and evaluation, dispute mechanism
20.   The rehabilitation action plan will addreas the following:
i.    The project design, including an analysis of alternative designs
aimed at avoiding or minimizing"resettlement;
ii.   socioeconomic survey and activities to ensure restoration of in-
comes of project-affected people in line with Coal India's re-
settlement and rehabilitation policy;
iii. description of the institutional and other mechanisms for provi-
sion of entitlements;
iv.   timetable for the acquisition and preparation of the resettlement
site(s);
V.    the cost and budgets for the resettlement and rehabilitation of
project-affected people;
vi.  project-specific arrangements to deal with grievances of affected
people; and
vii. timetables, benchrarks and arrangements for monitoring the re-
settlement and rehabilitation effort.
Socioeconomic survey
21.   A baseline socioeconomic survey will be carried cout to identify the
project-affected people and ensure restoration of incomes in line with Coal
India's resettlement and rehabilitation policy. This survey will be conducted,
prior to notification under the relevant land acquisition Acts, by the subsid-
iaries with the help of reputed outside independent institutional agencies who
are well versed with the social matrix of the area.                                     V
22.   The basic objective of the socioeconomic study will be to generate
baseline data on the social and economic status of the population who are
l..kely to lose their means of livelihood or b--mestead to the acquisition of
the land for the project. The database will be used to formulate a viable and
practical Rehabilitation Action Plan for the affected persons in line with
their entitlements.

Schedule of the census and formulation of the Rehabilitation Action Plan
23. Qnce the demographic and socioeconomic data is available, the Rehabilita-
tion Action Plan will be formulated in consultation with the affected people
and the State Government. It will be formulated as a simultaneous activity
with the land acquisition process.
Monitoring and evaluation
24.   The Rehabilitation Action Plan will be monitored and evaluated periodi-
cally after the completion of the land acquisition process.
i.    The resettlement and rehabilitation activities are the responsi-
bility of a separate group, both at the projects and corporate
level, which will be constituted for plAnning, implementation,
monitoring and evaluation ot the Rehabilitdtion Action P3an  At
the corporate level the group will be headed by a Senior Manager,
whereas at the project, an executive of the rank of Manager will
head the group. The project group should have at least one member
with social science experience and/or skills.
ii.   The project group will closely interact with the state authorities
during the implementation of the Rehabilitation Action Plan. Al-
though the subsidiaries will develop the plots and infrastructural
facilities in the resettlement colony and actively implement the
plan, assistance of State authorities will be taken for adminis-
trative services such as allotment of land. Implementation will be
planned and monitored and corrective measures will be incorpo-
rated, if needed. In addition to the State Government, the
project-affected people, the village leaders including the
Pradhans and NGOs will be consulted and associated with the imple-
mentation of the plan.
iii.  The Resettlement and Rehabilitation Cell at the corporate level
will evaluate the implementation of the Rehabilitation Action Plan
after its completion.
Mechanism for dealing with disputes
25.   A committee comprising nominee(s) of the State Government, nominee(s) of
the project general manager of the subsidiaries, a representative of the
project-affected people and an independent party, such as a respected commu-
nity leader, a retired judge or principal of a reputed local institution of
higher education, will be constituted to examine the grievances of the af-
fected person and propose corrective actions as required. The subsidiaries
will make arrangements for establishing the Committee and bear the cost.
