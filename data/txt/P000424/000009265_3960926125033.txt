MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAPE VERPE
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION UPGRADING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit tc the Republic of Cape Verde for SDR3.3 million (US$4.2
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would assist in
financing a project aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of basic
education and strengthening the management of the education sector.
2.        Background.  In the absence of significant mineral deposits and in
view of its scant agricultural potential, Cape Verde must rely on increasing
the productivity of its labor force to further economic development. To
achieve this, the basic education and skill levels of the population need to
be developed. Through the Government's efforts, an enrollment ratio of
about 100% in the first six years of education has alreaiy been attained.
Both the quality and efficiency of basic education are low, nowever,
adversely affecting further levels of schooling and, consequently, labor
productivity. Only 14% of the students who enter the first grade
successfully complete the six-year cycle, and many of those remain deficient
in basic education s.ills.
3.        The factors underlying the poor quality and inefficiency of the
education system include: (i) the dual structure of basic education, unde:-
which first cycle students (grades 1-4) are unrealistically expected to
master basic education skills, while second cycle students (grades 5 and 6)
are prematurely exposed to advanced secondary subjects, resu'lting in high
repeater and dropout rates (about 30% and 52%, respectively, in both
cycles); (ii) the limited availability of second cycle school places (58% of
needs), especially in rural areas, due to their high per student cost
(US$85, -- twice as much as in the first cycle) and conservative, rigid
teaching bractices which require a minimum of nine single specialty teachers
to open a second cycle school; and (iii) inappropriate sxamination practices
involving overambitious student achievement objectives and a lack of uniform
evaluation standards and norms . These factors have been compounded by the
low level and declining trend of expenditures on the education sector in
general, from 17.8% to 15% of Governmrnt recurrent budget over the 1982-1986
period; and on basic education in particular, from 71% to 65% of the
Ministry of Education (MOE) budget during the same period.  The decline in
resources allocated to basic education has resulted in insufficient
provision of teaching materials, poor teacher training facilities and low
teachor salaries relative to comparable occupations, making it difficult for
the Government to recruit and retain qualified teachers. Furthermore, these
already limited resources are inefficiently utilized, with for example a low
pupil/teacher ratio of 30:1 in the first cycle of basic education. Poor
quality and inefficiency is partly the result of the poor management of the



-2-
education sector, which suffers from the MOE's unclear edministrati'e
structure, work programw and procedures, as well as from a scarcity of
planning, analytical and managerial skills among its staff. The Government
is aware of these issues and, in its Second Five-Year Development Plan
(approved in December 1986) proposed to address them through a broad
strategy centered around the development of a unitary six-year basic
education system.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  In recent years, at the
Government's request, IDA has played an increasing role in helping Cape
Verde to prepare and implement long-term plans for its economit development
and to coordinate external donor interventions. Because of the country's
limited natural resource base, the education sector plays a pivotal role in
IDA's assistance strategy by focusing un upgrading the educational and skill
levels of the labor force to increase their contribution to growth in the
fishing and service industries, and to improve their mastery of the
technologies needed to exploit the country's agricultural and water
resoirces. The proposed project would be the first step in implementing
this strategy. Through appropriate policy and financial measures and a
sound investment program, it would create the necessary conditions to: (i)
improve the quality and efficiency of basic education; (ii) establish an
appropriate institutional framework for the efficient management of the
education system; and (iii) encourage a balanced development of higher
levels of education and training. To date, the development of the education
system in Cape Verde has been piecemeal, with limited and selective
intervention by donor agencies. By contrast, the proposed operation was
designed with the collaboration of other donors and has served as a vehicle
to help the Government set up procedures for the coordination of sectoral
development policies and investmtnt programs among donors.
5.        Proiect Objectives.  In suppc-t of the Government's efforts to
improve the quality and efficiency of basic education, the overall objective
of the project would be to provide a policy and institutional framework, as
well as the necessary educational inputs for the phased countrywide
establishment of an integrated six-year basic education system and for the
improvement of education sector management. These inputs would be
complemented by a forthcoming AfDB-assisted project, providing for the
construction of additional classrooms required for countrywide
implementation of the new six-year system.
6.        Proiect Description.  In order to achieve the above objectives,
the project would: (i) develop an integrated six-year basic education
system by preparing, implementing and evaluating the new curriculum,
teaching materials, appropriate pedagogical methods and new policies for
promotions and examinations in the Municipality of Santa Cruz; (ii) help
improve pre- and in-service primary school teacher training programs and
introduce salary incentives as part of a broad staff development plan to
attract and retain qualified teachers in basic education schools; (iii)
support the publishing and distribution of more appropriately designed low
cost basic education textbooks, by establishing a textbook and teaching
materials preparation urit, utilizing a more efficient distribution network,



and creating a Textbook and a School Supplies Revolving Funds; and
(iv) improve education sector management by establishing a new
organizational structure and relevant institutional units, and developing
new procedures for the planning, monitoring and evaluation of work programs
of the various departments of the MOE, as well as the implementation of a
staff training program.
7.        The project, to be carried out over a six-year period, provides
funds for civil works, vehicles, furniture and equipment, training and
technical assistance and incremental operating costs.  The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$5.3 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$2.6 million (49%). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Cape Verde are given in Schedules C and D, respectively,
followed by a map of the country. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6844-CV,
dated October 29, 1987, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed that it woulds
(a) implement the basic education reform countrywide in phases over an
agreed upon calendar coveri:, the 1991-93 period; (b) implement a system of
automatic student promotion in phases covering the 1991-1995 period;
(c) approve and implement by 1989 regulations to (i) establish in-service
and pre-service teacher training programs, and (ii) govern certification and
salary status fcr teachers having successfully completed these programs; (d)
implement cost recovery measures for textbooks and school supplies, and
establiE.. a Textbook Revolving Fund, and a School Supply Revolving Fund, by
August 31, 1991; (e) increase budgetary allocations by 1991 for (i) the MOE,
to 18.5% of the Government recurrent budget, (ii) basic education, to 72% of
the MOE budget, and (iii) teaching materials and inspectorate services, to a
total of 10% of the basic education budget, and (iv) maintain these
percentages in 1992 and 1993; (f) implement rcAasures to increase the
pupil/teacher ratio from 30:1 to 36:1 between 1988 and 1994; (g) not later
than August 31, in each year, review jointly with the Association (i)
proposed budgetary allocations to and within MOE for the following Fiscal
Year, (ii) progress achieved by MOE's institutional units in the
implementation of their annual work programs, (iii) progress achieved
towards the implementation of EBI in the Municipality of Santa Cruz; and (h)
implement the agreed recommendations of the review mentioned above. As
conditions of effectiveness, the Government agreed that it would: (a) enact
the Organic Law of the MOE; (b) legally establish the Institute of
Education; (c) appoint the Project Director, Deputy Project Director and
Project Accountant; and (c) open a separate account with an initial deposit
of US$75,000 equivalent for Government counterpart financing.
9.        Benefits.  The project would help improve the quality and
efficiency of basic education as well as access to higher levels of
education. The foundation laid by the project would also enhance
productivity in other sectors. Increased literacy would eventually
contribute to improved and sustainable agricultural productivity through use
of more complex techniques in water management and soil conservation. In
addition, fertility rates would be expected to decline, health practices
improved, and trainability of the labor force increased. Restructuring
basic education would reduce the rural-urban imbalance by providing two



- 4 -
additional years of quality education in more of the smaller settlements.
The project would also increase the efficiency of the education system by
improving its management and increasing budgetary allocations to the sector.
By focusing on the establishment of a teacher training capability; systems
for preparation, procurement and distribution of textbooks; and
upgraded management, the project would provide the institutional framework
needed for continuous improvement in the education sector and in future
investment programs.
10.       Risks.  This project would be the first large-scale project
implemented by the MOE and would include broad educational reform and
instItution building objectives. As such, it pose3 three major risks:
(a) the implementation demands might be too complex for the MOE staff;
(b) the institutional development objectives of the project may prove
difficult to achieve; and (c) the design of the six-year integrated basic
education system mr.y require refinements as experience is gained. The first
risk would be addressed through the broad administretive reform of the MOE,
involving more efficient management procedures and staff training; the
provision of local con6ultants and short-term outside technical assistance;
and the creation of a Project Advtsory Committee to ensure coordination of
project activities. To minimize the second risk, an Organic Law,
establishing the new structure and functions of the institutional units and
the staffing profile of the MOE, would be passed as a condition of
effectiveness. The operations of the new units would be based on well-
defined annual work programs and budgets, monitored by the Ministry's
Consultative Council. To reduce the third risk, the educational reform
proposals would first be implemented and evaluated in one municipality,
prior to countrywide generalization following a major mid-term review. In
addition, joint GovernmentlIDA annual reviews would assess progress toward
the agreed upon budgetary, educational and efficiency targets included in
the rroject and determine necessary refinements.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Ag eement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
