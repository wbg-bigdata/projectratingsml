I. INTRODUCTION
1.01       The Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the recently
established Alexandria National Steel Company, S.A.E. at El Dikheila (ANSDIK),
the Project enterprise, have requested loan financing of US$165.3 million from
IBRD and US$95.2 million from IFC and equity financing of US$7.2 million from
IFC to assist in implementing a reinforcing bar project (the Project), which is
estimated to require total financing of US$800 million. The Project, to be
located at El Dikheila (15km west of Alexandria), is designed to meet the needs
of the domestic market for reinforcing bar (rebar) -- a vital input for the
construction industry -- and would substitute for annual imports of around
750,000 tons of product. Egypt is projected to continue to import rebar
following the implementation of the Project to cover its domestic requirements.
The Project is based on the direct reduction/electric arc furnace route to steel
production and would utilize domestic natural gas resources for the reduction
process. The Project would be implemented and operated by ANSDIK, constituted
under Law 43 l/ as a joint venture among a diversified group of Egyptian
sponsors and a Japanese Consortium (JC) comprising two steel companies (Nippon
Kokan K.K. and Kobe Steel Ltd) and a trading company (Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd).
1.02       The Project concept was first proposed for IBRD and IFC (hereinafter
jointly referred to as World Bank Group or WBG) financing in late 1978. It has
since taken concrete shape through the substantial efforts of the concerned
Egyptian parties (primarily the Executive Organization for Industrial and Mining
Complexes - IMC representing Egyptian interests), the Japanese International
Cooperation Agency (JICA), JC and WBG. The feasibility study for the Project
was prepared by JC for JICA in 1979. The Basic Engineering Report was
completed by JC in February 1981 and has been updated since.
1.03       WBG has played a key role in helping to prepare the Project and
design the associated implementation arrangements. The Egyptian authorities
consulted with WBG in their selection of the technical partner in the Project
enterprise based on proposals received from several international steel
companies, in structuring the joint venture and related engineering, training
and management arrangements, and in developing the financing plan for the
Project. The focus of WBG's efforts has been to structure arrangements which
provide adequate safeguards against the risks of capital cost increases and
implementation delays, and to maximize the absorption of new technology and
associated managerial knowhow to achieve rapidly and sustain efficient full
operation.  The Project relies heavily on the commitment of JC (which combines
Project design, implementation, training, operational and managerial expertise)
as an equity partner in the Project enterprise. The continued involvement of
both IFC and IBRD is intended to enable WBG to contribute to enhancing the
private sector orientation of the Project as well as to assist the Egyptian
Government in promoting the rational and economic development of the steel
sector and associated policies in Egypt.
1.04       Following several meetings among the concerned parties during the
course of Project preparation in Cairo, Tokyo and Washington, the Project was
appraised in the Spring of 1982 by a joint mission of the Bank and IFC.
Subsequent follow-up discussions took place in Egypt in November 1982.
1/  Irrespective of their ownership, companies constituted under Law 43 are
considered to be in the private sector with regard to all aspects of their
operation and are thus substantially different from public sector
enterprises which are governed by a large number of policies and regulations
which limit their decision-making autonomy.

II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND THE STEEL INDUSTRY
A. The Industrial Sector
2.01      Egypt's industry (manufacturing and mining, excluding petroleum) is a
key sector in the economy; it has experienced relatively high growth rates
(9.6% between 1977 and FY81 2/ at constant 1975 prices) supported by
substantial increases in total factor productivity. However its share in GDP
has declined to around 15.2% in 1980/81, because of the growing importance of
revenues from petroleum. In 1980/81 the sector employed about 1.5 million
people (nearly 13% of the civilian 'Labor force) and was responsible for 13% of
commodity exports. Recent growth of the Egyptian economy has been heavily
reliant on exogenous resources (i.e., petroleum and gas revenues, workers
remittances, Suez Canal earnings and net foreign capital inflows), which
accounted for around 45% of the total resources available to the economy in
FY81, up from about 6% in 1974. A decline in these resources must be
counteracted by investments that increase Egypt's net foreign exchange earnings
and savings. The industrial sector will have to play an important role in this
process through increased efficient import substitution and the generation of an
exportable surplus of manufactured goods so that Egypt can reduce its dependence
on the external sector and establish an adequate and diversified domestic
industrial base.
2.02       As a result of the nationalizations in the early 1960s, the public
sector, comprising some 200 firms, accounts for almost all of the large
enterprises including Egypt's basic industries (iron and steel, aluminum and
fertilizers). It generates some two-thirds of the value-added in industry and
mining and provides slightly more than half of the total industrial employment,
mainly in four subsectors: textiles, food products, metals and engineering, and
chemicals. The private sector in Egypt is primarily associated with the small
and medium scale industrial activities and accounts for about one-third of total
value-added in industry and about half the sector's labor force. Garments, food
products, leather, furniture, plastic and metal products are the important
industries of private activity.
2.03      The performance of the industrial sector, which was characterized in
1973-74 by important idle productive capacities, rapidly improved following the
announcement of the "open door" policy in 1973, which resulted in the relaxation
of controls and greater availability of foreign exchange. Except for a
temporary slowdown in the growth of industrial output in 1978 (5.5% expressed in
value-added), the sector's output hias grown at an annual average rate of about
8% between 1974 and FY81. The growth of industrial output in the public sector
during this period has had mixed results and averaged about 7%. On the other
hand, the private sector has shown a remarkable annual average growth of 12%,
all in real terms, between 1974-80. As a result, its share of total
manufacturing output has increased from 25% in 1974 to 30% in FY81. Its share
in total industrial investment has also increased from an average of 4% before
1974 to about 30% in FY81, reflecti;ng a favorable response to the Government's
policy.
2.04      Egyptian industry has significant long-term prospects to grow and
broaden its base deriving primarily from the large and growing domestic market
2/ Egypt's fiscal year changed from a calendar year system to a July-June year
in 1980.



- 3 -
and a strategic location with access to markets in the Middle East and Europe.
An industrial structure and tradition already exist, as well as a large and
still relatively low-cost labor force. Given the enormous pressure of
population on cultivable land and the growing food and fiber needs of the
domestic economy, agriculture cannot provide much of the foreign exchange
resources and the employment growth on which the future of the economy
ultimately depends. It is to industry that the Government looks to provide
stimulus to growth through efficient import substitution emphasizing
intermediate and capital goods, and expanded exports, as well as to help absorb
the growing labor force.
2.05      In order for Egyptian industry to play a more dynamic role, it will be
necessary to overcome existing sector policy and administrative constraints as
well as a variety of bottlenecks, such as inefficient and obsolete equipment,
the result of past shortages of foreign exchange; implementation delays
resulting from inadequate performance by Egyptian construction companies and
shortage of construction materials; inadequate supply of skilled manpower; and
lack of contact with new technology, products, marketing and management
techniques, which are to be explained by Egypt's limited exposure during the
1960s and early 1970s to the markets that could offer these facilities.
Given that most public sector enterprises are overstaffed and suffer from a
variety of administrative and policy constraints, and that appropriate policy
changes could take some time to be put in place, the private sector (including
Law 43 companies) will be important in creating new employment opportunities.
The Government is moving in a number of ways to address some of these problems
in both the public and private sectors. The Government, assisted by the Bank,
has completed a construction/contracting study to identify constraints to
construction sector efficiency and is discussing the implementation of its
recommendations which include extensive policy and institutional reforms.
Further, a trade strategy and investment planning study which analyzes
comparative advantage in Egyptian industry as a basis for determining priority
areas for efficient import substitution and export expansion has been
completed. The Government is also working on specific legislative proposals to
reform and liberalize the policies and regulations governing the public sector
and thus lay the base for higher efficiency in the sector. Such a basic change
in the country's economic framework will take time to implement. In the
meantime, the Government has introduced over the last few years several ad hoc
measures such as the elimination of employment quotas and ceilings on bonus and
incentive systems, the granting of selective price increases of some products
(including steel), unlimited participation of foreign contractors in civil
works, and greater flexibility in foreign exchange dealings and purchase/import
of equipment. By means of joint ventures under Law 43 and technical assistance
programs financed by the Government and external donors, know-how, training and
other assistance is being provided to the industrial sector to upgrade its
management, technological and production capabilities.
B. The Egyptian Steel Industry
1. Development and Status
2.06      The Egyptian steel industry accounted for about 2% of GDP and employed
about 45,000 persons (3% of the industrial labor force) in 1980. Despite its
low share relative to the economy, the steel industry is vital in view of its
impact on the nation's construction industry and its role in stimulating the
diversification of Egypt's industrial base through its linkage with downstream
engineering industries. Steel production has increased by an average of about



- 4 -
8% per year during 1976-82. Of a toital estimated consumption of 2 million tons
of finished products in 1982, domestic production is expected to supply around
1 million tons, the balance being met through imports.
2.07      Steel production in Egypt derives essentially from four public sector
companies. Production is dominated by the Egyptian Iron and Steel Company
(HADISOLB), the country's only integrated steel complex, which started
operations in 1958 and now employs over half of the workers and produces over
half of the finished output in the sector. The three other companies which were
established between 1947-52 -- Egyptian Copper Works; Delta Steel; and National
Metal -- are fairly small and together produce about 0.3 million tons per year
(tpy) of finished steel, primarily reinforcing bars and other non-flat
products. They produce steel from steel scrap by either the open hearth or the
electric arc furnace process. HADISOLB uses the blast furnace/basic oxygen
furnace route for iron and steelmaking utilizing iron ore from a company-owned
mine near the Bahariya oasis, about 350 km to the south west of HADISOLB's
location near Cairo. Metallurgical coal requirements of the steel industry are
entirely imported; other energy needs, including oil and natural gas, are
covered domestically. There are also four small public sector foundries and
forges making steel castings and forgings. Except for the few very small
foundries still operated by the private sector, the steel industry is entirely
in public hands since its nationalization in the early 1960s. With the
Government as majority shareholder, the Ministry of Industry has prime
responsibility for the industrial public sector enterprises. The private sector
plays an important role in the import of steel products; it is responsible for
around 50% of such imports with the remainder being coordinated through Delta
Steel for the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction (paras 3.41 and 3.42).
2.08      Based on plans for new capacity and modernization/expansion of
existing capacities (para 3.39), steel production in Egypt is forecast to reach
around 1.2 million tons of finished products by 1985 (prior to the Project) and
a maximum of 2.7 million tons by 1990 (after the Project reaches full
production). In view of projected demand of around 2.5 million tons in 1985 and
over 3.5 million tons in 1990, the relative importance of imports in meeting
domestic requirements will decline, though Egypt will continue to rely on
foreign steel in most product categories through the forecast period (1990).
A detailed analysis of supply and demand for rebar, the output of the proposed
Project, is presented in Chapter III.
2. Issues and Problems
2.09      The present installed steelmaking capacity in Egypt corresponds to
about 1.6 million tpy of finished products. In the past, production has been
constrained to under 1 million tpy due to a number of technical and
institutional problems (para 2.10), particularly at HADISOLB. It is expected,
however, that the ongoing implementation of the Bank-financed HADISOLB
Rehabilitation Project (para 2.13) will lead to major improvements in capacity
utilization.
2.10      The Egyptian steel industry faces a number of serious problems which
affect its present performance and Euture development prospects:
(i) Investment and Product Planning: The responsibility for the public
sector steel industry, under the Ministry of Industry, is shared by the General
Organization for Industrialization (GOFI, responsible for investment planning
and procurement), the Executive Organization for Industrial and Mining Complexes



- 5 -
(IMC, responsible for actual implementation of large scale projects), and the
Hi'- g    uncil for the Metallurgical and Engineering Sector (responsible for
coordinating plans of companies within the sector). Additionally, the General
Authority for Investments and Free Zones is responsible for approving specific
projects/investments under Law 43. This arrangement has resulted, in the past,
ln a  ,-Ch o.E coordinated planning of the development of the steel sector.
Projects proposed by individual companies have generally been considered in
relative isolation of overall sector prospects. While this has been less of a
coucej:.i, Lshe period where there were ample import-substitution opportunities
in virtually any product-group, it could emerge as a significant problem as
Egypt approaches self-sufficiency in some products. Investments and the
associated product-mix need to be carefully coordinated to ensure balanced
development and avoid duplication of facilities, which could result not only in
lost scale economies but also in temporary domestic market oversupply;
(ii) Institutional and Policy Framework: Under existing legislation and
policies, public sector enterprises suffer from a lack of adequate autonomy with
regard to investment, pricing, marketing and employment/salary policies and
decisions. These enterprises find it difficult to retain and adequately
motivate employees and generally their productivity is low. Steel output prices
and some input prices are controlled (para 3.43). The Government has introduced
some ad hoc liberalization measures (para 2.05);
(iii) Status of Technological Capability: The production facilities of the
four public sector companies suffer from a variety of technical problems:
obsolete technology and equipment, capacity imbalances and inefficient
organization of production flows. Lack of adequate managerial and operating
know-how, a shortage of skilled operators and poor operating practices further
exacerbate the existing technical problems and result in poor production
performance. The problems can be overcome through well-conceived
rehabilitation/expansion programs, complemented by upgrading/training of
managerial/operating manpower. Such an effort is underway at HADISOLB
(para 2.13) and under study (by GOFI) for the other three companies; and
(iv) Financial Situation of Steel Companies: As a result of the above
problems the financial performance and status of the public sector steel
companies have been unsatisfactory thus limiting availability of funds for
required investments in maintenance, rehabilitation/modernization and working
capital. Following price revisions in 1980-81, the profitability of these
companies has improved.
2.11       The major problems facing the Egyptian steel industry can be overcome
with a strong Government commitment to formulating and implementing a sector
development program including necessary policies, especially for reforms in the
way the public sector enterprises are managed and regulated. These problems
must be overcome to exploit the inherent comparative advantage in steelmaking
that Egypt enjoys. The country has: a relatively substantial and rapidly
growing market for steel which could take advantage of economies of scale in
production; a fairly well-developed infrastructure; an industrial tradition even
in steelmaking; its own hydrocarbon energy resources; and a relatively low-cost
and readily trainable labor force. In addition, Egypt is at a stage of
industrialization where important linkages between the steel sub-sector and the
capital goods/consumer durables sub-sectors as well as the construction industry
should be established as a means of broadening the industrial base and of
creating employment. Efficient development of the steel industry and the



- 6 -
consequent domestic availability of quality steel products at internationally
competitive prices is vital to stimulating the growth of a competitive
engineering industry.  Further, technological and managerial know-how gains
achieved in the steel industry can be expected to filter into the engineering
and ancillary industries and subsectuently affect the entire industrial sector.
The impact of the steel industry on the construction sector 'an area of
difficulty i  Egypt) will be readily apparent through the elimination of
existing supply bottlenecks (para 2.05).
2.12       The development of the steel industry is among the high priority
programs of the Government.  Following the rehabilitation of HADISOLB
(para 2.13), the proposed Project is the first major step in this direction.
The Project is judged to be the most appropriate alternative to meet a major
proportion of the economy's need for rebar, which has been adequately
established (Chapter III). Further smaller increases in output, taken into
account in the market analysis, are to be achieved through the rehabilitation of
existing mills and investments directed to a narrower range of the required
overall product mix. In order to ensure future rational and orderly development
of the industry, agreement has been reached with the GovernLment that it will
formulate a sector development program to be completed by April 30, 1984 and
that it will discuss the recommended program and the actions to be taken towards
its implementation, with WBG. The program will build on previous partial
studies and will include, inter alia: a market study comprising projections of
steel requirements by product and size through the year 2000; an optimal
investment program including requirements for introduction of new technologies,
rehabilitation/modernization of existing capacities and addition of capacity in
view of available capacities (including the Project) and domestic market growth;
a review of the existing institutional mechanism for coordinating sector
development with a view to defining better the responsibility and accountability
for specific actions, including monitoring of industry performance and market
development; review of the present dual distribution and pricing system
(paras 3.41 to 3.46) and development of an overall pricing policy (output and
inputs) for the public and private sectors; and specific proposals for enabling
improvement in the public sector steel company management and operating
performance including policy measures, financial assistance and management/labor
training programs. The program will be available well ahead of the start-up of
the Project, and its recommendations (e.g., in the area of distribution) would
be incorporated in the operations/policies of the Project enterprise. The scope

Government. The development of the program will be carried out by local
consultants (supported by GOFI) under the direction of a steering committee
comprising senior representatives of concerned ministries/agencies, the steel
companies and user industries, i.e., construction and engineering. The steering

C. Bank and IDA Involvement in the Egyptian Steel Industry
2.13       Bank and IDA involvement in the Egyptian steel industry started with
a metallurgical sector study undertaken as one of six industrial sub-sector
reviews financed under the Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project of
December 1974 (Credit No. 524-EGT and Loan No. 1062-EGT).  he study was carried
out during 1976-77 and identified, among others, a high priority
rehabilitation/debott'lenecking requirement for HADISOLB. On the basis of this
study and subsequent discussions among the Government, HADISOLB, IMC and the



Bank, the Bank approved a US$2.5 million engineering loan in July 1977 (Iron Ore
Beneficiation and Engineering Project - Loan No. S5-EGT) to finance consultancy
costs related to: the techno-economic evaluation and design/engineering of an
iron ore beneficiation project for HADISOLB; and a study directed to
recommending improvements in the company's operations. On the basis of the
recommendations of this consultancy effort, the Bank provided a loan of
US$64 million to HADISOLB (Loan No. 2002-EGT) in 1981 as part of a
rehabilitation program designed to increase achievable output from the present
0.8 million tons to 1.2 million tons of liquid steel annually which will be
converted mostly into flat-rolled and partly into non-flat products for the
domestic market. Besides removing technical production bottlenecks, the project
aims to effect substantial improvements in the company's operations and
strengthen its management and organization through a revamping of the company's
salary and incentive system. Following a delay due to engineering changes,
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. HADISOLB, the three other
small semi-integrated public sector steel companies (para 2.07) and the El Nasr
Coke Company were also beneficiaries under the Bank's Second Industrial Imports
Loan of July 1977 (Loan No. 1456-EGT) receiving financing for the import of
equipment (US$10 million) and raw materials (US$18 million). The proposed
Project is thus the continuation of an ongoing effort on the part of the Bank
Group to assist in the development of the Egyptian steel industry. As a
continuation of the Bank's dialogue with Egyptian authorities on policies and
measures to promote efficiency in the steel industry, the Project includes
therefore, as noted, a Government commitment to formulate a program to promote
efficient development of this industry (para 2.12).
III. THE STEEL MARKET
3.01      The Project is directed entirely to meeting Egyptian home market
requirements of reinforcing bar (rebar) -- a vital input for the construction
industry. Since the early 1970s the Egyptian economy has witnessed a major
increase in steel demand, largely as an outgrowth of a dramatic expansion of
construction activity, and for the last few years has had to rely increasingly
on off-shore sources which now account for about one half of its steel
requirements. Egyptian steel demand is projected to continue to increase
rapidly in the 1980s as construction activities continue to expand specifically
to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population. Without the Project, net
imports would increase significantly, exacerbating foreign exchange
limitations. Even with the Project, Egypt is expected to remain a net importer
of steel, including rebar.
3.02      The rapidly growing need for rebar is clearly demonstrated -- the home
market is sizeable and no exports are planned -- and there is therefore little
risk to the Project in this respect. Nevertheless, in evaluating the Project's
viability, the question must be answered whether future international steel
availability and prices justify the Project as a substitute for continued heavy
reliance on imports. The current state of the steel industry in industrialized
countries is one of "major recession", and the resulting observed plant
closings, capacity reductions and low export prices color the perspective in
evaluating steel projects. The market situation in developing countries, and
specifically Egypt, however, is different from that in industrialized
countries.

3.03      While the present problems of the steel industry, particularly in
industrialized economies, are fully recognized, they cannot be taken as
representative of long-term future developments, especially in developing
countries. It is thus important to take a closer look at what has happened, and
what is expected to happen, in the world steel situation, in order to obtain a
better understanding of how these changes bear upon the economic viability of
the Project. It should also be noted that rebar, the output of -he Project, and
other light non-flat products are characterized by several special
considerations that separate them from the broad spectrum of steel products. A
detailed discussion of the world steel market, particularly as it relates to the
type of product to be produced by the Project, is provided in Annex 3 "The
Outlook for Light Non-Flat Products", prepared jointly by the Industry
Department and the Economic Analysis and Projections Department, and is
highlighted below. The international steel market analysis is followed by a
discussion of the Egyptian market for rebar -- the Project output.
A. The World Steel Market and Price Trends
3.04      Since 1974, the world steel industry has witnessed major changes.
In industrialized economies these changes included: pronounced market
fluctuations though in a generally declining market; over-capacity and plant
closures; and, particularly in some European countries, heavy financial losses
and the extension of subsidies to an increasing segment (now about 70% of
existing European steelmaking capacity) of state-owned steel companies; as well
as major Government and joint European Community efforts to address ensuing
problems. As a result of developments in industrialized economies, harsh price
competition occurred in international steel trade. It would appear that 1982
was the low point for the steel industry in industrialized economies, with weak
markets, low operating rates, and substantial price cutting brought on by a deep
recession. In developing economies, steel production and markets continued
expanding throughout the period though at a considerably slower rate. Major
changes in steel production techniques also occurred in the 1970s with
scrap-based mini-mills making major inroads into ore-based integrated operations
predominantly in light non-flat products (LNFP -- wire rods, bars and sections
below 80mm).  This has led to greater use of scrap relative to iron ore and to
the development of directly reduced iron (DRI) as a scrap substitute in those
countries (such as Egypt) where scrap is not abundant and domestic energy
resources (so far, principally natural gas) have made DRI production
economically attractive.
3.05      The following sections review recent developments in the world market
for steel and then assess future prospects with particular emphasis on rebar.
1. Past Trends in World Steel Consumption and Supply 3/
3.06      Through the 1960s and early 1970s, world steel consumption grew at an
annual rate of around 4.7% at about the same pace as GDP growth. There were
business cycles during this period, and some quite sizeable, but they were
around a rising trend. Peak levels of output and consumption in the
industrialized market economies were reached in 1974 (391 million tons in the
industrialized economies and 706 million tons worldwide) coincident with the
first sharp increase in oil prices, as shown in the following table.

equivalent.

'b)/ Data shown include China.
3.07      The ensuing energy crisis contributed to a major slowing in GDP
growth worldwide, and especially in industrialized economies. Perhaps more
importantly, it brought to the fore major structural changes in the
industrialized economies. These combined changes have resulted in a relative
decline in the share of investments in capital intensive sectors (which
traditionally have accounted for between 30 and 40% of steel consumption),
substitution of lighter, corrosion-resistant materials, such as aluminum and
plastics, for steel, and increased efficiency efforts by steel-using
industries. In response to these changes, the steel industry itself has
undergone structural adjustments as evidenced by the growth of less capital
intensive small scale mini-mills, and by the rapid application of new
technologies directed to improving productivity and yields and increasing energy
efficiency (e.g., ultra high power electric steelmaking, continuous casting and
direct rolling).
3.08      The above changes have dramatically reduced the annual growth in
steel consumption to about 0.6% worldwide, in the period 1974/75 to 1980/82.
The industrialized market economies, principally the US, the European Community
(EC) and Japan, have had negative steel consumption growth (by about 2.2% per
year from a 1974 peak of 391 million tons). Developing market economies have
had some slowing in steel consumption growth, i.e., from 9.3% a year through
1974/75 to 5.0% a year thereafter. This latter reduced growth rate still
remains above that experienced by industrialized economies prior to 1974.
Consequently, the developing countries' share of the world's steel markets has
increased from about 9% in the early 1970s to an estimated 18% in 1982. Steel
consumption in centrally planned economies has continued to grow, but at reduced
rates (down from 5.3% annually through 1974/75 to 1.5% thereafter).
3.09     Because of the recent slow growth in the world steel market, business
cycles have no longer been around a rapidly rising trend; instead troughs have
become more severe and peaks less pronounced. The 1982 trough has been
particularly severe. World steel consumption in 1982 was around 655 million
tons (versus 706 million tons in 1974 and 730 million tons in 1980) with that in



- 10 -
industrialized economies declining to about 285 million tons (versus 391 million
tons in 1974 and 344 million tons in 1980), while consumption in developing
economies was about 120 million tons (versus 126 million tons in 1980).
3.10      During the early 1970s, spurred particularly by the 1973-74 peak in
steel consumption which brought the steel industry worldwide to the limits of
its productio capability, many steel producers embarked on ambitious expansion
plans based on optimistic expectations of future steel demand. The slow-down in
economic growth since that time, and the greater downward severity of cycles has
resulted in lower capacity utilization rates (from over 85% in the 1960s and
early 1970s to an average of about 80% thereafter) in industrialized economies.
In 1982, operating rates fell to about 64% in industrialized market economies as
a whole (50% in the US, 67% in the EC, and 70% in Japan) 4/. While
industrialized market economies have suffered from excess capacity, developing
economies have remained close to their sustainable production capability which,
in view of technical constraints and the lag between installing new capacity and
reaching full production, is somewhat lower than stated effective capacity. In
these economies consumption exceeds capacity, and around one-third of their
requirements are currently imported from industrialized nations.
3.11      Governments of major industrialized steel producing countries have
reacted in various ways to the industry's problems. Examples of the steps taken
include the Trigger Price Mechanism, introduced in 1978 (but subsequently
superceded by agreed limits on imports from the EC and Japan) and accelerated
depreciation allowances in the US; a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)
rationalization plan combined with the closure of obsolete facilities and the
imposition of individual country production quotas; and the Japanese
Administrative (Price) Guidance System. Additionally, the industry's own
response has led to the closure of some obsolete facilities and a shift in
investment strategy from capacity expansion to cost reduction. As a result
effective capacity in the industria:Lized market economies has remained flat
since the late 1970s after the investment boom in the early part of the decade
had run its course (para 3.10) and :is expected in this report to decline
marginally further through at least the mid-1980s. At the present time, it is
generally accepted that there is substantial obsolete capacity which is expected
to be closed down (approximately 15: of stated capacity) in the US and the
EC 5/, thus probably further reducing capacity below that assumed herein.
2. Future Trends in World Steel Demand and Supply
3.12      The current recession marks a pronounced cyclical downturn combined
with a painful adjustment to structural market changes (para 3.07) in
4/  In late 1982 operating rates in the US fell below 40%, but have since risen
to about 50%.
5/  The objective of the EC Commission in Brussels is to reduce steelmaking
capacity in its 10 member countries on average by 20% by 1985. The Steel
Restructuring Plan stipulates two principles: (a) public aid is not to be
granted to steel companies unless they reduce their capacities; and (b) no
further subsidies will be permitted to steel companies beyond 1985. It is
thus expected that the industry by then will have come back to profitable
operations. It is also estimated that losses in (primarily state-owned)
steel companies in the EC amounted to approximately US$4.4 billion in 1981.



- 11 -
industrialized market economies. Cyclical recovery, however, is expected to
occur. Much needed investment projects have been deferred and steel
inventories, particularly in the US, are now at the lowest levels since the
1970s. Further, the impact of many of the structural changes referred to above
has been absorbed fully. Thus increased growth in steel demand worldwide,
including in the industrialized market economies, is forecast for the decade
ahead. This, combined with the projected global slow capacity growth, and the
stagnant capacity levels in the industrialized market economies is expected to
increase operating rates significantly.
3.13     As shown in the following table, between 1980 and 1990 steel demand is
forecast to increase in industrialized economies at an average rate of about
0.6% per annum 6/, in developing economies by 3.0%, and in centrally planned
economies by about 0.7%.  Total average demand growth worldwide would thus be
about 1.1% per annum during the current decade as against a growth in capacity
of about 0.6% during the same period.

3.14     The modest overall steel demand growth projected for the 1980s,
combined with a still lower capacity growth in industrialized economies, will
bring about a major improvement in the average operating rates of the steel
industry worldwide, and particularly in industrialized economies during the
6/  1982 steel demand in industrialized economies is, because of a major
recession, down about 17% from 1980 levels. Between 1982 and 1990, recovery
from the depressed 1982 levels is expected to occur at rates in excess of
the rate of 0.6% per annum forecast for the 1980s. If the actual rate of
growth after 1982 were not to exceed 0.6% per annum, then the demand figures
shown in the following table would be achieved several years later. It
should, however, also be noted that six other recent non-Bank forecasts
project a steel demand growth in the industrialized economies of between
0% and 2% per annum during the 1980-90 period, with an average expectation
of approximately 1.5%.

course of the present decade. The ciapacity data shown above represent estimates
of sustainable capacity rather than engineering estimates of operating"
capacity; the latter are, typically, higher. However, in periods of time
(particularly over the past three years) when markets are depressed, companies
make decisions which reduce capacity but which take some time to show up in
published statistics. During the interval, published capacity data may be
overstated and not be a true reflection of effective capacity -- this is
believed to be the case in the US in 1982 and the EC since 1979.  For example,
based upon published data, US capacity would be about 140 million tons, but
(taking into account unpublished assessments of plants which will not be
re-opened) effective capacity appears to be closer to 125 million tons.  A
somewhat similar situation exists in the EC and is exacerbated by attempts to
overstate effective capacity in order to minimize the impact of intra-EC
production quotas. Every effort has been made in developing the capacity data
shown for 1985 and 1990 in the above table to ensure that the numbers are an
adequate representation of sustainable capability to produce finished product.
Under this concept of effective capacity, capacity utilization rates in the
industrialized economies in 1973-74 were close to 100% thus leading to a steel
shortage and very high export prices (chart, para 3.20). It should be noted
that the projected capacity utilization rates in industrialized economies in
1985 (83%) and 1990 (89%) are substantially higher than in recent years and in
line with those prevailing prior to 1974. This projected tighter relationship
between demand and supply would support a strengthening of steel prices
(paras 3.20 and 3.21).
3. The Prospects for Rebar
3.15      Within the range of steel products, light non-flat products (LNFP -
wire rods, bars and sections below 80 mm) which are largely consumed by
construction and construction-related industries, are particularly significant
to developing countries where construction is one of the fastest growing
sectors. In 1981 approximately 110 million tons of LNFP were produced and
consumed in market economies. This tonnage compares to an estimated capability
to produce these finished products of approximately 140 million tons. The
structural changes (para 3.07), which followed the energy crisis and are
typified by attempts to substitute :Lighter, stronger and more corrosion-
resistant materials for heavier steel products, have had their most dramatic
impact on flat rolled products, such as plates and sheets (e.g., for
automobiles). In contrast, LNFP have been isolated from these structural
changes, although not from the consequences of slowing GNP growth, also
associated with the energy crisis. Nevertheless, the prospects for LNFP must be
differentiated from those for flat rolled products; demand for LNFP is expected
to grow relative to that for steel as a whole in the 1980s. In a sense, this
differentiation has been reflected in steel production with new mini-mill
producers (which supply LNFP) growing rapidly, while typical integrated
producers (which concentrate on flat rolled products) are reducing their
capacity.
3.16      In contrast to flat rolled product mills, relatively small LNFP plants
are already economic. Because they require less capital and smaller domestic
markets, investment in the production of LNFP is often the first step in the
establishment of a domestic iron and steel industry in developing countries. At
the same time, traditional large integrated steel mills in the industrialized
economies have tended to shift away from LNFP to higher value-added products,
leaving the production of LNFP to efficient, small-scale producers



- 13 -
(mini-mills). In 1981, the developing countries accounted for about 35% of the
demand and 30% of the production of LNFP in market economies. In the same year,
around 15.8 million tons of LNFP were internationally traded, with the
developing countries as a group accounting for about 50% of total LNFP imports.
3.17      A major proportion of LNFP is rebar -- the output of the Project.  No
separate data are maintained for rebar on a systematic basis by most steel
producing countries. Most data for rebar are included with wire rod, merchant
bar and other light structurals. In view of this data limitation, the rebar
market cannot be analyzed as extensively as the market for all steel products.
In 1981, an estimated 48 million tons of rebar was produced and consumed
worldwide, of which about 40 million tons was produced, and 36 million tons
consumed, in market economies. Total effective (ignoring obsolete) production
capability worldwide is estimated to be in the neighborhood of 60-65 million
tpy, with market economy capability of 50-55 million tpy. However, estimates of
production capability for rebar are not very meaningful, because rolling mills
which are primarily designed to produce merchant bar, wire rods and light
structurals can also produce rebar. Thus the rebar capability estimates above
are not true physical constraints, but are nonetheless representative if one
assumes, as is the case, reasonable parallelism in the demand for rebar and
other LNFP.
3.18      Rebar is the lowest cost major finished steel product.  Hence, given
transport costs, rebar is one of the least profitable steel products to ship
long distances, especially if it has to compete with domestically produced rebar
in the importing country. Prior to 1974, international trade in rebar was small
and represented only about 5% of production in market economies as most
consuming countries were substantially self-sufficient. Since then, growth in
developing country markets (especially in OPEC countries in the Middle-East and
North and West Africa) with limited production capability has increased rebar
trade to around 5.0 million tons in 1980 or approximately 10% of production in
market economies whereby the developing countries as a group accounted for over
50% of total rebar imports. Increased self-sufficiency is expected in
developing economies, stimulated partly by local market growth and partly by
potential comparative advantage such as lower labor and energy costs and a
freight advantage.
3.19      The rebar market (and to a lesser extent that of other LNFP) is highly
cyclical because of its sensitivity to investments in construction. There is a
strong correlation between construction and overall economic activity which
tends to accentuate the cyclical nature of the rebar market. Year to year
consumption deviations of plus or minus 10% from the trend are not unusual. In
mid-1982 the rebar market in market economies declined approximately 20% from a
1979 cyclical peak, a decline not out of line with past experience. An upturn
beginning in 1983/84 is expected, partly because inventories must be
replenished, and partly because some new investment and rehabilitation projects
can no longer be deferred. Rebar consumption in the 1980s is anticipated to
grow at about 2% per annum worldwide from a 1980 base, with a growth of
approximately 4% per annum in developing economies.
4. International Rebar Price and Cost Trends
3.20      Prices of steel products, especially rebar, are highly volatile in the
short term:, depending upon market conditions (varying directly with capacity
utilization rates), although in the longer term steel prices cover production
costs and provide opportunity returns. Institutional factors such as minimum



- 14 -
prices set by Governments can disrupt price-cost relationships, as can exchange
rate changes. The volatility of rebar export prices is illustrated in the
following chart. It should be noted that in periods when market conditions are
very strong and capacity utilized at high levels (e.g., 1973-74) in
industrialized countries, export prices rise dramatically. Conversely when
market conditions are weak and substantial excess capacity exists (e.g., 1982)
prices drop irecipitously. From trough to peak the price deviations have been
up to 2.5 times. 1982 is expected to be the low point of the current business
cycle, with atypical exchange rates and low steel export prices prevailing,
which are reinforcing each other.

YEARS
3.21       As shown in the table following para 3.23, over the past 20 years
rebar export (FOB Antwerp) prices in 1982 US$ have averaged US$330/ton for spot
sales 7/; US$309/ton from 1962-71, US$382/ton from 1972-77 and US$300/ton from
1977-81. The high 1972-77 prices r-eflect the increased energy cost resulting
from sharply higher energy prices and peak demand during the 1973-74 period.
The subsequent drop in prices (1977-81) combines the effects of decreasing steel
demand and successful efforts to inicrease energy efficiency (e.g., increased
importance of mini-mills rather thain integrated production of rebars) and to cut
production costs. These price movements are clearly tied to capacity
utilization with the 20 year average being 85% while the average over the
1972-77 period was 84%, and over the more recent 1977-81 period 80%. As the
utilization rate rises to the projected level (83-89% in the industrialized

exports are handled on this basis.

economies, table, para 3.13) a substantial strengthening of steel prices,
including those for rebar, can be expected. Due to major and continuing efforts
to improve efficiency it is unlikely that, in the longer term, rebar prices will
return to the 1972-81 average of US$351/ton, but given the much higher level of
energy prices a return to the 1960s level of US$309/ton is equally unlikely. A
reasonable expectation would appear to be export prices of around US$330/ton for
a longer term normal situation with spot sales being priced somewhat lower.
3.22      The prices discussed (whether export or domestic) are essentially for
16mm rebar, inclusive of extras applicable to that size. Extras are premiums
charged for variations in the size and grade of a product. A list of EC extras
is shown below, for two rebar grades. These extras vary substantially with the
size and grade of the product, and no product is without extras even though a
base (plus extras) price is often quoted. The average quoted EC extra for the
typical (16mm) rebar product was US$30/ton in 1982. It should be noted that for
smaller diameter rebar (e.g., 10mm) the extras are substantially higher (by
around US$15) than for 16 mm bar. It should also be noted that each of the
grades shown normally have a different base price -- with that for Steel 52
about US$20 above that for Steel 37 in 1982 US$.

3.23      Export rebar prices tend to be somewhat lower than domestic prices as
shown in the following table, for the EC. The differential has averaged 12%
over the past 20 years, and 10% over the past 10 years.   These differentials
reflect some price discounting, but according to European steel producers, they
largely reflect internal transport costs (since the domestic prices used are
delivered prices) and differences in product quality. Export prices are also
more volatile than domestic prices (with fluctuations averaging 20% from the
20 year norm for exports as against 8% for domestic prices) reacting more
dramatically to changes in capacity utilization. In recent years (1977-81),
because of weakened markets, lower operating rates and exchange rate changes
(para 3.24), export prices have fallen relative to domestic prices resulting in
an average discount of 18%. These price decreases reflect, to a greater extent,
price discounting rather than quality differentials. As markets recover, a more
normal relationship between export and domestic prices can be expected to be
reestablished.

3.24      Average 1982 export rebar prices of US$218/ton were especially depressed
and were well below the long term norm. The 1982 price fall is partly cyclical,
reflecting weaker markets and substantial excess or redundant capacity in
industrialized countries. However, 1982 prices also reflect unusual exchange rate
parities. Since the US is not a significant exporter of steel, rebar export
prices are largely determined in the EC and Japan, but are quoted in US$. Thus
exchange rate changes can have a major impact on export prices. The 1982 US$ to
Yen (average of Yen 245:US$1) and Deutsche Mark (DM 2.40:US$1) exchange rates were
atypical of recent levels. Exchange rates averaged around Yen 220:US$1 and
DM 2.05:US$l between 1977-81, and Yen 230:US$1 and DM 1.97:US$1 between 1979-81.
Were 1982 exchange rates at 1977-81 levels, 1982 EC rebar export prices would have
been closer to the long term norm at around US$255/ton rather than the US$218/ton
shown in the above table. Average 1982 export prices expressed in terms of US$
therefore appear more depressed than they are in other currencies and in any case
cannot be taken as representative of those likely to occur throughout the life of
the Project. The price levels appropriate for evaluating the Project are those
based on long term trends where prices cover costs and provide opportunity
returns, with short term cyclical and exchange rate abnormalities eliminated.
3.25      As shown in the following table, rebar in 1982 cost (i.e., before
depreciation, interest and profit) between US$239 and US$252/ton to produce in
efficient mills in the US, Japan and the EC.  Hence, current (1982 average) export
prices (at US$218/ton) are well below full production costs (and below domestic
prices) reflecting present depressed conditions in the world market and
consequently low operating rates.  However, like 1982 prices, 1982 costs cannot be
taken as representative of long tern trends.  Scrap is the main raw material for
rebar, with the US being the major world supplier. Scrap prices in 1982 averaged
about US$63/ton in the US, far below the 20-year average of US$111.5 (in 1982
US$); in Europe, scrap prices have been US$10-20/ton higher.   As the world steel
market recovers, scrap prices can be expected to increase not only because



- 17 -
of cyclical recovery, but also due to the continued structural shift towards
steel production by the electric furnace route (scrap-based) from integrated
operations (iron ore-based). This structural shift is evident both in the US
(where there is an abundance of relatively low cost electric power) and in the
EC and Japan. Thus, real scrap prices in the late 1980s are likely to recover
to near historic norms. There is, however, an upper bound to scrap prices and
that is the price at which either directly reduced iron or granulated pig iron
become cost effective substitutes. It is assumed that in the long term, a real
scrap price level of US$105/ton (1982 US$) will prevail in the US, with Japanese
and EC prices remaining somewhat higher. Japan and the EC import scrap from the
US, but are expected to become increasingly self-sufficient so that scrap price
differentials will narrow, and competition for US source scrap will become less
intense.

representative of Italian costs, although components of the costs for Italy
may differ somewhat from those in F.R. of Germany (e.g., lower cost
labor).
c/ Principally overheads.
3.26      The preceding table shows projected rebar production costs in
efficient mills, taking into account projected scrap prices, real energy cost
increases (partially offset by improved energy efficiency) and other adjustments
(such as productivity improvements, better operating rates and the
reestablishment of more typical exchange rates). These production costs can be
regarded as representative of the more efficient producers which participate in
world rebar trade. The costs are for mini-mills; to the extent rebar is still
produced in integrated plants, their costs are significantly higher. The energy
crisis increased steel production costs in integrated plants, encouraging



- 18 -
mini-mill development as a lower cost replacement. As noted earlier, a sizeable
segment of the EC steel industry is presently incurring losses, and (table,
para 3.23) export prices (resulting from competition in the international
market) are at their lowest relative level for some years and substantially
lower than domestic prices.
3.27      TLe elasticity of the cost structure in US$ to relative exchange rate
changes, at the parity levels shown in the preceding table, is estimated at
around 0.7 for Japan and 0.8 for the EC, another indication that exchange rate
changes do significantly affect production costs and prices.  The general
expectation in Japan and Europe is for the US$ to return to its average levels
of the past 3-5 years, which would substantially increase costs and prices of EC
and Japanese producers in US$.
3.28      On the above basis, average ex-factory rebar prices, which provide
expected opportunity returns for the efficient producers, producing a mix of
domestic and exported product, are forecast at about US$325/ton in the US and
Japan and US$330/ton in the EC (in 1982 US$).  For the longer term, factors such
as real increases in energy prices have not been taken into account and, if they
occur, could be expected to be compensated by offsetting product price
increases.  Since these average prices are based on the cosL-structure of
efficient, low-cost producers, they form a lower bound for domestic prices in
producing countries in periods where rebar demand and supply are in reasonable
balance (as projected after 1985).  Average domestic prices can be expected to
be somewhat higher. For the product of the quality and type to be produced by
the Project, the export price would be around US$325-330/ton in line with
average ex-factory prices.  For spot sales of untested quality some discounting
from this level may occur (para 3.23). Such discounts are unlikely to apply to
sustained sales in large volumes. For example, Japanese sales to Saudi Arabia
(a large buyer) in the 1976-81 period, for the same product quality as domestic,
were at domestic (Japanese) price levels. The US$325-330/ton projected export
price, based on projected normal costs, is somewhat lower than the 1972-81
export price average (US$351/ton, in 1982 US$) reflecting real cost reductions
in steel production, associated with efficiency gains, and the continued
emphasis on small-scale electric furnace technology, rather than large-scale
integrated operations. The above analysis based on production costs and that
based on historical price trends (para 3.21) both support a projected export
price, for the quality of product to be produced by the Project, of
US$325-330/ton. It should be noted that Project output would meet all relevant
standards applied in industrialized economy markets and thus result in an
improvement over the present situation where imported rebar is not necessarily
of tested quality.
3.29     In evaluating the Project, the relevant rebar prices are the long-term
average landed prices of imports (excluding any import duties and taxes) rather
than the average export prices derived above.  In view of the projected export
prices and expected transport cost differentials, the EC is expected to remain
the most competitive supplier for Egypt.  The EC supplier could be considered to
be either a coastal mill (largely in northern locations distant from Egypt) or a
closer inland mill (e.g., in Italy). In either case freight costs to Egypt
would be about the same. In the last few years, Czechoslovakia has been an
important supplier of rebar to the Egyptian market (para 3.45) at prices below
those of other exporters. It is thought that its prices have primarily



- 19 -
reflected the country's need to earn foreign exchange rather than coverage of
full production costs, which are unlikely to be lower than those of the
efficient producers shown in the preceding table. Over the long term it is not
expected that Czechoslovakia could expand its rebar exports to Egypt to the
required quantities (its exports to Egypt in recent years have averaged under
100,000 tpy) while maintaining its current low level of prices. Inland
transport (in the exporting country) and freight costs based on normal
conditions are estimated at US$45/ton from Europe to Egypt (Alexandria);
insurance, handling and other import-related charges are estimated at US$25/ton
based on current costs of Egyptian importers (para 3.44). This would bring the
landed price in Egypt (1986-88) in 1982 US$ to US$400/ton (US$330/ton ex-factory
plus US$70/ton transport and related charges). In deriving these costs and
prices, standard sizes (16mm) and quality (St 37) have been assumed; applicable
extras (para 3.22) specific to the Project product-mix have not been
considered. For the Project, the product will be 50% Steel 52 and 50% Steel 37,
adding US$10 per ton to the base price. Similarly, the median size will be
10mm, rather than 16mm, adding US$15 to the base price. The Project is expected
to sell at prices competitive with equivalent imports (para 3.48). Its average
selling price is thus assumed to be the same as the landed (economic) price of
imports, as shown below:

B. The Egyptian Steel Market
3.30      Given the above background to the international market, the prospects
of the Egyptian steel market are evaluated below. As the analysis shows, the
Egyptian market, in sharp contrast to the depressed markets in industrialized
countries, has remained strong in recent years and is expected to maintain
relatively high growth rates in the future.
3.31      The Egyptian economy consumes currently (1982) about 2 million tpy of
steel products, of which close to 1 million tons are domestically produced, with
the balance being imported. The growth in the Egyptian steel market has been
significant, averaging around 12% per annum since 1973. To a large extent the
strength in this market can be attributed to very rapidly rising construction
activity in Egypt which began in 1974, following the implementation of the "open
door policy in 1973 (para 2.03), and when the Government began allocating
increasing public resources to housing a population which is growing at more
than 2.5% per year. As a consequence, consumption of cement has been increasing
at above 13% per year since 1973, and that of rebar (to make reinforced
concrete) at comparable high rates (para 3.33).

a/ Imports are handled through both public (under the responsibility of the
Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction) and private sector channels
(paras 3.41 and 3.42).
3.33      The above apparent consumption of rebar increased on average at around
15% between 1973 and 1981; and is estimated to have increased by 9% in 1982.
Domestic production, however, has not kept pace with consumption, and indeed has
remained relatively unchanged at between 250-280,000 tpy since 1977. This has
led to rapid increases in rebar imports, which now supply almost three-fourths
of domestic rebar requirements (versus about one-third in the early 1970s). The
substantial inventory fluctuations since 1980, as shown in the above table,
reflect anticipation of market growth and a response to changes in exchange
rates, import tariffs (suspended in May 1980) and availability of foreign
exchange.
3.34    The size-mix of the rebar consumed has remained relatively stable in
recent years. Between 1979 and 1981 around 15% of consumption was accounted for
by sizes up to 8mm in diameter, 50% by those between 10 and 14mm, 23% by sizes
between 16 and 20mm, and 12% by larger diameters. However, domestic
production (public sector) has been heavily weighted to the larger diameters
(3% up to 8mm, 33% 10 to 14mm, 36% 16 to 20mm, and 28% larger sizes), while
imports have been weighted more to the smaller sizes.
3.35      Worldwide, as noted previously, rebar is mostly produced domestically,
with limited international trade because it is relatively simple to manufacture



- 21 -
and commands high transport costs relative to its value (para 3.18). Thus the
large volume of Egyptian rebar imports is unusual, reflecting a low level of
industrialization and a situation in which long-term economic adjustments (such
as increased rebar production) have been constrained by lack of capital and
access to know-how. A country of the size and population of Egypt, which is
heavily engaged in construction activity, cannot be expected to depend for the
majority of its rebar requirements on imports.
2. Market Forecasts for Rebar
3.36    The following table gives the expected demand/supply balance for rebar
in Egypt through 1990.

a/ Excluding inventory changes.
3.37      As shown above, Egypt would continue to import rebar even after the
Project reaches full production of around 754,000 tpy (including short sizes of
9,000 tpy). The domestic market could also absorb an output of 800,000 tpy
which is considered to be the maximum production capability of the Project.
3.38      Demand.  Forecasts of Egyptian rebar demand are based on projections
of the country's economic growth and construction activity. The construction
industry, which as noted is the dominant market for steel products in Egypt and
accounts for the entire consumption of rebar, is not expected to sustain its
recent performance (growth of around 14% a year during 1973-81). GDP is
projected to increase at an annual average rate of around 7% between 1981 and
1985 and 6% between 1986 and 1990. Construction sector growth, while expected
to continue to exceed GDP growth by a slight margin in the early 1980s is
projected to decline gradually from the recent level (14%) to around 7% by the
late 1980s. Construction activity growth is expected to be supported especially
by investments in infrastructure. Based on these factors, rebar demand is
projected to grow at an average annual rate of 7% up to 1985 and 6.5% through
1990 and result in the rebar demand of around 1.3 million tons in 1986 and
1.7 million tons in 1990 shown in the above table.
3.39      Supply.  The prospects for rebar supply in the future have been
closely examined and are reflected in the above table. Existing mills in Egypt



- 22 -
have a production capability of around 280,000 tpy which, through modernization
and rehabilitation of existing facilities, is expected to increase to around
320,000 tpy by 1985. Further increases in capacity at the existing mills
through marginal incremental investments are not considered possible. The major
increase required in domestic production is thus expected to be achieved through
addition of new capacity, primarily the Project (754,000 tpy). In addition,
output of aroiad 0.5 million tons from new capacity (including existing mills
requiring substantial additional investments) is assumed based on preliminary
plans and discussions. This new capacity is expected to rely largely on
billet-based rerolling and scrap-based electric furnace operations. To the
extent that some of these capacities do not materialize, the potential market
available to the Project would be larger than shown. The risk of a domestic
market constraint, even in the face of slower than projected growth of demand,
is thus low. It should be noted that the present size of the domestic market is
adequate to absorb the full output of the Project. In any case any further
investment and capacity addition in the steel sector in Egypt will be based on
the Sector Development Plan to be prepared by the Government as part of the
Project and discussed with the Bank prior to implementation (para 2.12).
3.40      The size-mix of rebar demand, which is currently heavily weighted in
the 10-14mm range (para 3.34) is expected to be spread more evenly across the
smaller sizes, i.e., 6-12mm (based on a larger proportion of low-rise buildings
in the new urban centers). Virtually all new project plans (para 3.39) that
have a defined product-mix emphasize production of the smaller sizes; the
Project will cater to demand for the full range of diameters demanded by the
market, i.e., between 6 and 38mm. The Project includes the flexibility to
accommodate some shifts in its size-mix. The proposed size-mix of the other
planned investments will need to be coordinated to prevent possible imbalances
in the smaller size ranges. This is one of the aspects to be addressed in the
proposed sector program (para 2.12).
C. Distribution and Pricing of Rebar in Egypt
1. Distribution
3.41      Rebar is distributed in Egypt through both public and private sector
channels: the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction has the sole responsibility
for distributing rebar for "special" purposes, broadly defined to cover a range
of public sector uses, such as low cost housing, new cities, development of
infrastructure and foodstuff security projects. The Ministry purchases rebar
from the domestic producers and alsc from foreign suppliers (based on
international tendering except under special bilateral arrangements). The
physical distribution function is carried out by the Rebar Distribution Bureau
operated by Delta Steel. Contractors are required to take delivery from one of
the depots operated by Delta Steel based on licenses issued by the Ministry for
specified amounts related to specific projects.
3.42      Rebar for "non-special" uses is procured from foreign sources either
by private importers/stockists for wholesale and retail trade or directly by
large local and foreign contractors for their own use. Some contractors and
consumers rely on private sector channels also for "special" purpose uses due to
difficulties with delivery schedules and quality limitations of public sector
rebar. There are around a dozen steiel stockists; five companies controlled by a
single family account for around 60% of private sector imports. These companies
sell imported rebar directly to large contractors and also to wholesalers and
retailers. Small retailers are scattered around the country.



- 23 -
2. Pricing
3.43       "Special" purpose rebar is sold in Egypt at regulated prices (last
revised in May 1980) determined by the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction
based on a weighted average of prices paid to local producers and prices of
imports with an allowance for administration/distribution costs. The prices
paid to local producers are based generally on production costs which are
partially subsidized due to energy inputs being available (throughout the
economy) at substantially lower than international prices. The regulated prices
currently in effect are shown in the following table:
Egypt - Regulated Public Sector Rebar Prices
(1982 LE/ton)
Steel 37 a/        Steel 52 a/
Base Price                       263                283
Size Extras:  6mm                 33                 33
8mm                25                 25
12mm                16                 16
16mm                 3                  3
a/ Steel 52 (St 52) is of higher tensile strength than Steel 37 (St 37).
Actual prices to the consumer exceed above prices by around LE 35/ton because of
distribution costs and charges and costs related to differences between orders
and deliveries with regard to size/quantity. The resulting prices to the final
consumer thus range around LE 300/ton for St 37 quality and LE 320/ton for St 52
quality rebar. The relative structure of extras is similar to that applicable
in the EC (table, para 3.22), with the extras for sizes larger than 16mm being
absorbed in the base price.
3.44      The prices of private sector imports are determined based on the
landed price of imports plus markups to cover taxes, handling charges and
losses, and profit margins; import tariffs were suspended in May 1980. The taxes
account for around LE 35/ton and import-related charges for around LE 25/ton.
Profit markups have varied depending upon market conditions. Average 1982
(January-August) prices have amounted to around LE 350/ton based on a landed
price of around LE 280/ton (US$260/ton converted at the free market exchange
rate of LE 1.07:US$1). The historical movement of prices in Egypt as compared
to European export prices is shown in the following table.

a/ Import tariffs of around 20% suspended in May 1980 account for
the substantial premium over C&F Alexandria prices prior to that date.
b/  Base price for St 37 quality including additional charges of around
LE 35/ton (para 3.43).
c/ Import prices are not readily comparable with the FOB Antwerp prices
since the former reflect imports from all sources (including Eastern Europe)
and of different size and quality mixes.
d/ Converted at prevailing free market exchange rates.
3.45      In the prevailing (1982) depressed world market conditions, rebar
prices, C&F Alexandria, have been US$260/ton, but averaged as high as US$370/ton
(US$410/ton in 1982 dollars) in 1979. In 1980-82, aggressive pricing by
Czechoslovakia (an important exporter to Egypt) and some new entrants to the
market have influenced overall price 'Levels. Despite fluctuating prices, the
Egyptian rebar market has on average reflected a shortage situation in view of
the heavy reliance on imports and corresponding uncertainties with regard to
foreign exchange availability and delivery times. As can be noted from the
above table, Egyptian buyers have been prepared to pay private sector importers
significant premiums for the imported product -- a premium which in part, up to
1980, resulted from tariffs on private sector imports. Mostly, the private
sector has not enjoyed access to "special" purpose rebar sold through Delta
Steel; "special" purpose users, however, can switch to private sector supply.
3.46      The changing differentials between public and private sector prices
have influenced significantly the imports by the two sectors. The public sector
price is normally lower, but the private sector provides prompter service (and a
greater range of sizes). When the price differential is small, buyers eligible
for "special" purpose rebar appear to shift to private sector supply. Since
private sector prices more closely reflect world prices, which are very
volatile, this results in much uncertainty in ordering (duplicate orders),
sizeable inventory fluctuations, etc. Until recently public sector prices had
little relationship to world prices, with higher cost imports "subsidized" by
low cost domestic production based in turn, on subsidized input costs
(para 3.43). The current 2-tier pricing system and its relationship to world
prices is to be examined under the proposed sector program (para 2.12).



- 25 -
3.47      The Project, under Law 43, is free to set its own prices.  In line
with market conditions, it is expected to set prices at levels competitive with
the landed cost of imports (i.e., at economic levels). No import tariffs on
rebar are envisaged, unless, in line with present Egyptian policy, import prices
are judged to reflect subsidies in the exporting country. This pricing
principle has been accepted by the Government and was confirmed during
negotiations. Accordingly, the average sales price of the Pro,ect output used
in the analysis is US$425/ton in 1982 terms (table, para 3.29).
IV. THE COMPANY
A. Establishment and Ownership
4.01      The Project was first proposed for WBG financing in late 1978.
Following discussions between the Egyptian sponsors and WBG it was agreed that
the Project would be carried out as a joint venture between Egyptian parties and
a reputable overseas operating steel company with experience in implementing
projects. Based on the proposals received from several international steel
companies, the Egyptian Government, with the assistance of WBG, selected the
Japanese Consortium (JC), composed of two operating steel companies (Nippon
Kokan K.K. and Kobe Steel Ltd) and a trading company (Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd), as
the potential joint venture partner in early 1979. The selection of JC was
based on their extensive and successful record of designing, implementing and
operating steel plants with up-to-date technology and at relatively low cost;
this record is demonstrated in their recent successful involvement in a similar
but smaller project in Qatar (para 7.01). The availability of concessionary
untied funds from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) for the
Project facilitated the design of a satisfactory financing plan (para 6.06).
After extensive discussions and negotiations, a Basic Agreement, satisfactory to
WBC, was signed between the Project sponsors, IMC and JC, in September 1981.
This agreement (akin to a Shareholders' Agreement), which forms part of the
legal documentation, outlines the Project objectives, the organization and
management structure of the Project enterprise, the significant aspects of the
joint venture partnership, and the scope of services to be provided by JC.
4.02      The Alexandria National Steel Company, S.A.E. at El Dikheila (ANSDIK),
the Project enterprise, was incorporated in July 1982 as a joint venture company
under Law 43 of 1974 (as amended by Law 32 of 1977). The Company's initial
issued capital of LE 50 million has been fully paid in. The composition of the
initial shareholders which consisted of six Egyptian public sector companies
plus JC, is shown in the following table.
4.03       WBG has consistently emphasized the importance of diversification in
the shareholding as a means of enhancing the private sector orientation of the
Company and the independence of its Board. In line with this objective, the
initial six Egyptian founders undertook to transfer a substantial proportion of
their shareholding to other Egyptian parties. Three financial institutions --
the Misr Insurance Company, the National Bank and the Bank of Alexandria, have
each accepted to take up to 8% of the capital; the initial payment for these
shares has already been made. These public financial institutions have
demonstrated a private sector orientation as shareholders in the projects in
which they participate. Further, additional diversification will result from



- 26 -
the acquisition of shares by one or more public sector banks (referred to as the
participating banks) from the part of the Bank loan (US$68.51 million) being
provided to cover the foreign exchange contribution of the Egyptian shareholders
to the Company's capital (para 6.07). The resulting final shareholding is shown
in the following table. The respective shareholdings of the specific
participating banks (with which the Bank is well acquainted) are being reviewed
with WBG in the context of finalizing suitable on-lending agreements for this
part of the loan. In view of the nature and relatively long gestation period of
the Project, Egyptian private sector equity investment is not considered
feasible at this time but is expected at a later date. As a joint-stock
Company, ANSDIK will register its shares with the Cairo Stock Exchange and thus
facilitate their trading. Specifically, the participating banks and other
Egyptian shareholders would be obli'ged to make efforts to promote further
diversification and privatization through offering their shares to the general
investing public. Also, IFC and the Egyptian shareholders would agree that they
will consult with each other with a view to gradually offering their shares to
the general investing public in order to broaden further the Company's
ownership.

_        ==
4.04       In accordance with the Basic Agreement, the final share capital
envisaged for ANSDIK is 30% of the total investment cost, or around
US$240 million equivalent (LE 201.6 million) as per current estimates. The
capital of the Company will be increased to the above amount. This increase in
the capital and full subscription thereto is a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed Bank loan. The final shareholding in this capital, as shown in the
preceding table, would be: Egyptian parties 87%, JC 10%, and IFC 3%. The
proposed IFC participation of 3% in the equity (presently estimated at US$7.2
million) is essential to conclude the arrangements as envisaged and hence to the
Project; it is a condition of the Basic Agreement. The schedule for the



- 27 -
increase of the paid-in capital, planned by the Company, calls for payment of
60% of the incremental capital (or a cumulative amount of US$167.8 million) in
1983/84 with the remainder to be called as required in 1985 and 1986. This
payment schedule will ensure a sound capital structure through the
implementation period.  Steps to seek payment in line with this schedule have
already been initiated by the Company.
B. Significant Aspects of Partnership and Related Arrangements
4.05        In addition to prescribing the ownership structure of the Company,
the Basic Agreement defines the obligations and responsibilities of the
partners, which are further elaborated in the associated Management, Engineering
Services and Training Services Agreements.  These agreements were formulated in
consultation with WBG. Under the Management Agreement, JC is required to
provide ANSDIK with managerial/technical personnel, systems, and know-how to
ensure efficient implementation and day-to-day operation and management of the
Project. The Engineering Services Agreement makes JC responsible for providing
engineering and procurement services and for supervising the construction,
erection and commissioning of the plant. Under the Training Services Agreement,
JC would provide on-the-job and classroom training in Egypt and abroad to ANSDIK
personnel. The Management and Engineering Services Agreements have been signed
and the Company has agreed to seek WBG approval of any amendments thereto. The
Training Services Agreement is in the process of being finalized; formal
training is expected to begin in 1985 in preparation for start-up in 1986.
Specifics of the above agreements are discussed in the relevant sections of the
report; some salient aspects are outlined below:
(i) JC has the major responsibility for the management of the Company,
through JC personnel employed by the Company, for the period of construction and
the first five years of operation (paras 4.08, 4.09 and 5.12);
(ii) JC, as a group, is precluded from divesting itself of its shareholding
within five years of start-up and, without the prior consent of IFC, for as long
as IFC's loan to ANSDIK shall not have been repaid in full;
(iii) JC is obliged to enter into a Project Funds Agreement whereby it will
provide, up to a maximum of US$20 million equivalent, 20% (as against its 10%
ownership) of any additional financing required to cover shortfalls as
determined by IFC (para 6.10);
(iv) Bonuses will be payable to JC for exceeding agreed objectives including
target production levels; otherwise payments to JC will be limited to its cost
of providing the management services (para 7.01); 8/ and
(v)   The Company shall procure the steelmaking plant from JC, in recognition
of its critical importance and JC's expertise in steelmaking technology, on the
basis of an internationally competitive price (para 6.12). Y/
8/ Total management fees (1982-90), excluding bonuses, are estimated at US$60.5
million (in 1982 US$ converted at US$1:Yen 230) for provision of 610
man-years of assistance at an average rate of US$8,200/man-month.
9/ Bank funds are not involved in the financing of this package.

4.06       The initial Board of the Company includes eight members:  the
Chairman and one representative each of the initial six Egyptian shareholders
and JC. The statutes provide for an increase to 13 members as new shareholders
are brcught in (para 4.03). In view of the complex nature of the Project and
the role played by WBG in its deve:Lopment, IFC would also be represented on the
Board (once it has acquired shares) as already envisaged by the Project sponsors
in tha Basic Agreement.
4.07       The Chairman and Managing Director of the Company, Mr. Ibrah4m Salim
Mohammadain, is highly regarded in both Government and business circles. He has
previously served as Minister of Industry and as Chairman and Managing Director
of public sector as well as joint venture companies. He has been instrumental
in the efforts to diversify the Company's ownership and Board structure
(para 4.03) to assure a large measure of independence, which he and WBG believe
is essential to the success of the venture. The second-in-command, Mr. Mohammed
Khattab, appointed as Joint Managing Director by the Board, has over 25 years
experience in the Egyptian steel industry and for the past six years served as
Chairman and Managing Director of one of the smaller steel companies (Egyptian
Copper Works) (para 2.07). Key Egyptian personnel in the area of finance,
administration, engineering, procurement and construction have also been
appointed.
4.08       The majority of the management personnel, including the General
Manager, for the construction period and for the first five years of operation
are to be provided by JC. The General Manager, who reports to the Managing
Director, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company and has
full authority over the employees. He will also attend Board meetings but not
as a voting member. The agreements foresee different organizational and
staffing requirements for the implementation, pre-operating (beginning one year
before start-up), and operating phases.
4.09       The JC implementation management team of the General Manager and
eight specialists in the fields of engineering, procurement/shipping,
construction management, finance and administration are already in place and are
based in Dikheila. The General Manager, Mr. Hatori, is a Director of Nippon
Kokan and has a solid background of accomplishments in the engineering,
construction and operation of steel plants. In the pre-operating phase, JC will
prepare all necessary systems, procedures and plans for efficient operation of
the plant and management of the Company. These will cover, inter alia, the
areas of: organization, staffing, manpower development, production planning and
control, cost management, environment and safety control.  In this phase 25 JC
personnel (increasing to 146 six months prior to start-up) will be employed by
the Company and will be supported by back-up services provided from Japan.
Subsequently, in the operating phase, the organization proposed for the Company
is shown in Annex 4. In addition to Japanese heads for all departments other
than administration, a large number of Japanese specialists will be employed to
enable the Company to carry out all operational and managerial functions to
ensure the attainment of agreed production targets. At the peak, the Company
will employ 146 expatriate staff out of a total of around 1,835 employees; plant
operations initially managed by the Japanese team, with Egyptian counterparts,
are planned to be gradually transferred to Egyptian personnel over the first
five years of operation (para 5.12). The Management Agreement provides for the
Company to obtain additional personnel from JC, at no cost to the Company over
and above their normal salaries payable in Japan, if necessary to meet
production targets.



- 29 -
4.10       The management arrangements in place and planned are considered
adequate to achieve Project objectives. They rely on an effective collaboration
and transfer of operating and managerial know-how from JC to the Egyptian
employees of the Company. The working relationships established between the
Egyptian and the JC teams to date have been good. The Management Agreement
extending through the end of the fifth year of production might need to be
extended further if the transfer of know-how is slower than envisaged.
Accordingly, ANSDIK has agreed to consult with the Bank, prior to the expiration
of the Management Agreement for a possible extension of the agreement. As not d
earlier, JC will continue to remain a partner in the Project beyond the
expiration of the initial Management Agreement (para 4.05 (ii)).
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
5.01       The Project is directed to meeting the needs of the domestic market
for rebars and to substitute for annual imports of around 750,000 tons of
product thus saving Egypt valuable foreign exchange. Equivalent imports of this
tonnage would otherwise cost the country over US$300 million annually, in 1982
US$, at prices projected to prevail when the Project reaches full production.
Further, through domestic production, the Project is expected to assure a stable
supply of rebar to the Egyptian economy, and eliminate the problems of continued
imports of rebar in increasingly large quantities, which would make Egypt the
largest importer of rebar in the world. The Project is designed to produce
rebar efficiently and economically based on: a proven technology that utilizes
domestic natural gas resources and is less capital-intensive relative to other
options for integrated steelmaking; implementation arrangements that are
designed to complete the Project on time and within budget; and mechanisms for
the effective transfer of operating and managerial know-how (from experienced
overseas operating steel companies) to achieve rapidly and sustain efficient
full production. The Project also aims to assist in the rational and orderly
development of the Egyptian steel sector through the formulation of a sector
program (para 2.12).
B. Project Description
5.02       The Project comprises the construction and operation of a reinforcing
bar plant with a nominal output of around 750,000 tpy of rebar and a potential
production capability of about 800,000 tpy, at El Dikheila, 15 km west of
Alexandria. The Project is based on the direct reduction/electric-furnace
process route to steel production. Direct reduction, though a new technology
for Egypt, is commercially proven. It will utilize as the reducing agent
domestic natural gas as against coke produced from imported coking coal required
for the conventional blast furnace process. The proposed Project is judged to
be the most appropriate alternative for Egypt in view of the rebar output
required to meet domestic needs; rehabilitation of existing mills leading to
significant output gains is not considered feasible. Also, domestic production
of directly reduced iron (DRI) is more economic than entire dependence on (large
quantities of) expensive imported scrap; the economic cost of production of DRI
(excluding depreciation and interest) is estimated at around US$110/ton and
compares favorably with the projected landed price of scrap of US$147/ton (both



- 30 -
in 1982 US$ and excluding custom duties) even if the uncertainty associated with
stable imports of large quantities of scrap essentially from a single source
(i.e., the US) is disregarded. The primary Project facilities are: (i) a
natural gas-based direct reduction plant to produce around 720,000 tpy of DRI
with 92-95% metallization; (ii) a steelmaking plant consisting of four 70 ton
ultra high power electric arc furnaces with 46 MVA transformers and three
4-strand continuous billet casters for casting 130mm x 130mm billets; and (iii)
a rolling mill plant comprising two rolling mills and a common roll shop; the
bar mill fed by a 110 tph reheat furnace and the rod mill by a 80 tph reheat
furnace will jointly be capable of producing rebar in a diameter range of 6mm to
38mm, which constitutes almost the entire range demanded by the Egyptian market.
5.03       As part of the auxiliary facilities, the Project will also include a
lime calcining plant to provide its burnt lime requirements, plants for
briquetting the generated DRI and lime fines, an oxygen generating plant,
workshop facilities for all minor repair work and adequate materials storage and
handling facilities. Administrative facilities include site offices for the
major plants, a central office building, dining areas for the employees and
security and firefighting facilities. Additionally, the Project provides for
residential units and related social infrastructure for around 120 people to be
used largely by the JC team employecl by the Company in the initial years. Since
the other employees are expected to be drawn from the Alexandria area, housing
is not expected to pose any problem. Nevertheless, the Company is assisting
(financially and otherwise) in the establishment of a cooperative undertaking,
largely supported by local authorities, for the provision of housing to them, as
an added incentive.
5.04       The location of the Project (IBRD Map No. 16679) permits direct
access to a mineral jetty for its import requirements and to road and future
rail links for finished product distribution (para 5.07). The plant layout is
provided in Annex 5. The layout and the design of the Project are satisfactory,
and allow for a future expansion (Stage II) of the plant facilities to a
finished product capacity of around 1.2 million tpy. The layout can also
accommodate minor installations to incorporate, at a later date,
state-of-the-art technologies such as scrap preheating, water-cooling of
electrodes and oxygen lancing. Suitable modifications in arc furnace practice,
quality control facilities and rolling mill configuration could also be
incorporated to produce higher value grades, shapes and sizes. These additional
investments are not justified at the present time in light of the presently
limited domestic market for higher value products and the objective of focussing
on the rapid transfer of operating and managerial know-how related to the basic
technologies. This approach is expected to permit a quicker pace of learning
and a relatively more rapid buildup of the output level of the limited
product-mix.
C. Raw Materials, Utilities and Infrastructure
1. Raw Materials
5.05       The direct reduction process requires the input of lump-ore and
pellets of high iron oxide content and low impurity levels. In view of the poor
quality and difficult beneficiation characteristics of presently proven local
reserves, the Project will import its requirements of oxide pellets and lump ore
from sources such as Australia, Brazil, India and Sweden. Of the other



- 31 -
important raw material and consumable inputs, the Project will rely on imports
of scrap, ferro-manganese, fluorspar, electrodes and refractories, while
ferro-silicon, limestone, aluminum and coke breeze will be locally procured.
Scrap is expected to be imported primarily from the US though the supply could
be supplemented from sources in Europe, the Middle East and also domestically.
Availability of raw materials and consumables is expected to pose no difficulty
in view of tL  several potential sources for each input.  The Company plans to
enter into appropriate medium- and long-term contracts for the significant
inputs, such as iron oxide materials, as it approaches the start-up of
production. JC's extensive experience in the procurement (particularly
importation) of raw materials and consumables is being used to develop
cost-efficient alternative sources/shipping arrangements.
2. Utilities
5.06       Electric power will be received through two 220 kv lines (one
stand-by) from the adjacent Dikheila substation and stepped down to 33 kv and
6.6 kv for use in the plant. The substation and the feeder lines are planned to
be completed in early 1984, well in time to meet the Project's requirements.
The Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) has factored the Project's requirements
into its approved load and facility plans and the availability of adequate power
has been confirmed based on the power plants being constructed in the Alexandria
region. The Project includes a sophisticated flicker-compensating system to
protect the power grid from load surges characteristic of an electric furnace
operation. Natural gas, the other significant energy input, will be supplied by
the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) from the Abu Qir field. The
requisite quantities have already been agreed upon and the main Qir trunk line
and the planned connection to the Project site are expected to be completed by
mid-1984. The Project will include a receiving, filtering and pressure-reducing
station for the gas. Potable and make-up cooling water requirements of the
Project are to be met by the Alexandria city system. Oxygen and compressed air
will be generated on site.
3. Infrastructure
5.07       The Bank-financed Dikheila Port Project (Loan No. 2183-EGT), approved
by the Executive Directors in June 1982, includes a mineral jetty to serve the
raw material import and handling requirements of the rebar Project, including
its Stage II expansion (para 5.04), and other projected mineral-handling
requirements not related to the Project. The jetty facilities are designed
for ore-carriers of up to 160,000 dwt and include adequate unloading equipment
and stockyards. Iron oxide materials (pellets and lump ore) will be transported
to the Project site by means of overhead belt conveyors fed by two reclaimers;
scrap will be transported over a road which is being adequately widened. The
mineral jetty and related facilities are expected to be commissioned by end-1985
based on progress and plans for the construction of the port facilities well in
line with the requirements of the steelmaking plant which is scheduled to start
up in mid-1986. Transport of finished product and domestically procured
materials is planned by road. The Alexandria-Matrouh highway which runs
adjacent to the plant is currently being widened from 20 meters to 54 meters and
is expected to be adequate to handle future traffic including the Project's
requirements. A parallel road, which runs south of the Project site, could also
be used as an access road. No rail link is planned at this time but the plant
layout provides for a suitable land strip which could be used for this purpose
based on future needs.

D. Ecological Considerations

5.08       The Company has decided to adopt environmental pollKtion coatrol
standards applicable in major industrialized nations; these standards will be
incorporated in all bidding documents. Pollution control facilities will
include a fume extraction system in the arc furnaces; a collecting and
briquetting facility for DRI and calcined lime fines; bag-filters for containing
dust prior to release of exhaust gases to the atmosphere; and waste water/sewage
treatmar.t  Lcil-ties.  Dust emission will be limited to 100 mg NM3.  Appropriate
pollution monitoring equipment is also included. JC, under the Management
Agreement, is responsible for instituting a safety and accident prevention
system based on Japanese practice. The above measures are judged to provide
adequate and satisfactory environmental and safety control fac-lities.
Nevertheless, assurances have been obtained with regard to the proper final
design, implementation and operation of the various monitoring and control
measures and facilities.
E. Project Implementation and Management
5.09       The Project implementation schedule, which forms the basis for the
financial planning and projections, is shown in the following chart:

The above schedule projects start-up of all production facilities 49 months
following the issuance of bid invitations for the critical civ31i1 and building
works packages. Construction and start-up of the different facilities has been
phased to smooth out the engineering, construction and installation workload as
well as to take into account different production buildup requirements.  Site
preparation and detailed engineering are complete. The steelmaking plant
contract with JC (para 4.05 (v)) has been finalized; bid invitations for the
other major packages (civil and building works, direct reduction plant and the
bar mill plant) have been issued; preparation of bidding documents and
prequalification for the remaining packages is well-advanced. The schedule
proposed by JC, and adopted by the Company, has been reviewed by WBG and margins
leading to an extension of four mont:hs (in Project completion) have been added



- 33 -
as a contingency in the scbed'ile shown above. The Engineering Services
Agreement foresees a bonus, related to the amount of the engineering fee,
payable to JC as an incentive to complete the Project (as determined by the
start-up of all of the Project faci.lities) ahead of the schedule proposed by JC.
5.10       The schedule is based on Project implementation under the
arrangements planned. These incluee: engineering and procuremLent services as
well as supervision of constructicn, erection and commissioning to be provided
by JC; additional JC management support to the Company in the construction and
pre-operating phases; a limited rnumber of shop-wise procurement packages to
minimize interface problems; and the execution of critical civil and building
works by joint ventures of Egyptian and foreign contractors (based on
international competitive bidding), rigorously pre-qualified on the basis of
experience, track-record and other criteria. The management team in place,
including the Chairman and the Joint Managing Director, have prior experience in
managing large industrial projects; the Japanese General Manager and Deputy
General Manager have extensive experience in building steel plants including the
coordination of procurement and related activities.
F. Training and Manpower Development
5.11       The Project will employ 1,835 persons: 51 in the direct reduction
plant, 556 in the steelmaking plant, 342 in the rolling mill plant, 442 in
management, production control and administrative functions and the remainder in
supporting ancillary, utility and maintenance activities. The employee
distribution by category is shown in the following table:
ANSDIK - Manpower Distribution

Total                                        1,835
The employment policies and salary structure of the Company, as a Law 43 joint
venture, are being formulated so as to attract and retain competent people.
Managerial and staff positions for the implementation phase have mostly been
filled. No significant problems are envisaged in recruiting qualified and
experienced operating personnel.
5.12       The above figures include the JC personnel to be employed by the
Company and, as presently envisaged, to be gradually replaced by Egyptian
counterparts: 146 in the first year after start-up, 135 in the second, 85 in the
third, 81 in the fourth and 55 in the fifth and final year of the initial
Management Agreement. In addition to (i) the on-the-job training and transfer
of know-how to be provided by these JC personnel and (ii) the ongoing training
programs to be developed by JC and implemented by the Company, the Project
includes (iii) formal pre-start-up (on-the-jnr, dnd classroom) training in Egypt
(635 man-months) and overseas (125 man-me :..ns, likely to be increased further)



- 34 -
under the Training Services Agreement. The draft agreement has been reviewed by
WBG; the Company has agreed to seek WBG approval of the final agreement prior to
its signature and of any subsequent amendments thereto to assure the adequacy of
the training program. Its implementation is expected to begin in the year
before start-up.
VI.  PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Cost Estimate
6.01      The capital cost estimate prepared by JC as part of the Basic
Engineering Report has been reviewed extensively by WBG and the Company. The
updated estimate, following the latest review in July 1982 and based on the
projected schedule (para 5.09),is provided in Annex 6-1 and summarized in the
following table:

- 35 -
6.02      The cost estimates are based on JC's extensive experience as well as
specific budget quotations obtained from major equipment suppliers and
contractors.The major proportion of the foreign component of fixed asset costs
has been estimated in Yen and converted to US$ at an exchange rate of US$l:Yen
230 as compared to the present rate of around US$1:Yen 240 providing some
cushion against Yen appreciation. The estimate for civil and building works is
based on deta_led bills of quantities and unit rates that reflect imported
inputs as well as domestic inputs where Egyptian supply of materials or services
is expected to comply with required quality and delivery criteria. Equipment
cost estimates have also been developed in detail and include a year's
requirement of spares equivalent to around 9% of the equipment value.
Insurance, freight and inland transportation estimated to account for around
11% of the cost of equipment and spares have been included. The estimate for
the steelmaking plant contract has been confirmed in the price agreed with JC
(November 1982). Under the incentives available to projects established under
Law 43, equipment is expected to be imported free of customs duties. The
estimate for installation, which represents around 19% of the CIF value of
equipment, is based on estimated quantities of the variety of erection work
involved and is in line with experience on past steel projects. The amount
shown for engineering reflects the contract value under the Engineering Services
Agreement. The pre-production expenses provide adequately for training,
salaries and wages.
6.03      The estimates have been prepared on the basis of fixed price contracts
scheduled to be placed between March and December 1983. Price escalation
provisions based on this timing of order placement have been estimated at the
rate of 8% per annum for 1982 and 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% for
1986 on foreign costs and 9% per annum on local costs expressed in US$ excluding
costs for items already contracted, i.e., engineering, site preparation,
temporary facilities and the steelmaking plant. In view of the advanced state
of engineering, a physical contingency of 5% on the steelmaking plant (contract
already signed), 8.5% on other equipment, and 10% on civil and building works
and installation costs is judged to be adequate and has been assumed. The
working capital provision of US$60.8 million is adequate to provide for the
amount required for initial operations. An amount of US$5.0 million equivalent
is planned as ANSDIK's contribution to a cooperative undertaking for providing
housing for the Company's employees (para 5.03). In determining the total
financing required for the Project, commitment and front-end fees and interest
during construction (to be capitalized) estimated at US$49.7 million equivalent
have been included. In addition a provision of US$42.6 million has been made to
cover finance charges in the first year of production.
6.04      In evaluating the competitiveness of the estimated fixed asset cost
WBG first compared it with the known costs of similar plants in other developing
countries, e.g., Libya, Malaysia, Mexico, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Even allowing
for the imprecision implicit in comparisons of this nature, it is apparent that
the cost estimate of the Project compares favorably with those of the
above-mentioned plants. Because of its location in Egypt, the Project is
expected to incur higher freight, civil works and installation costs, include
some additional facilities and also needs to carry a higher inventory of spare
parts than typical industrialized country mills. Moreover, whereas developed
country mills normally cater only to a narrow segment of the rebar market, the
design of the Project necessarily provides for flexibility of product mix and
ease of operation, both of which carry a price tag. Taking all these factors
into account, the estimated capital cost of the Project represents a combination
of cost-effective design and efficient implementation under Egyptian conditions.

B. Financing Plan and Allocation of Funds
6.05     The financing plan for the Project is shown in the following table:

a/  IBRD financing of civil and bui:Lding works, after ICB, may entail local
currency financing of up to US$35 million. It is assumed that the Company
will be able to retain the fore:Lgn exchange disbursed against these
expenditures; otherwise the foreign exchange to be provided by local
shareholders would need to be increased by a corresponding amount.
b/ Excluding the front-end fee on this amount of US$0.51 million.
6.06      WBG has been instrumental in finalizing the above financing plan.  The
OECF (Japan) loan at 3.5%, to be repaid over 30 years (including 10 years
grace), to the Government would be on-lent to the Company on the same
concessional terms. The loan agreements, already finalized, are expected to be
signed shortly. The meeting of all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of
the OECF loan (and of the IFC loan, para 6.07) is a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed Bank loan. The plan envisages a debt to equity ratio of 70:30,
reflected in the Basic Agreement, which is acceptable given the concessional
terms of OECF funds. Export credits for up to 80% of the value of the main
plants have been confirmed; export financing from the Export Import Bank of
Japan (EXIM-J) of up to around US$212 million equivalent is assured for this
purpose and would be adequate if all main plant contracts were to be awarded to
Japanese suppliers. Should either or both of the rolling mill contracts be
awarded elsewhere (para 6.13), export credits from other countries would
substitute for EXIM-J financing. For analysis purposes, the export credits, in
line with those available from Japan, are assumed to carry 8.5% interest
(including provision for special charges) with repayment over 16 semi-annual
installments beginning 6 months after start-up.



- 37 -
6.07     The Bank loan of US$165.3 million would be made to the Government 10/
at the standard variable interest rate 11/ for a period of 15 years
including five years of grace. O this amount, US$96.79 million would be
on-lent to the Company for the same length and grace period. ANSDIK will bear
the foreign exchange risk and also pay a fee to the Government which would bring
the total cost of borrowing to the Company (excluding the commitment and
front-end fees) to 110% of the actual Bank lending rate; this _otal cost is
generally in line with present local commercial interest rates on foreign
exchange loans. 12/ The remainder of the Bank loan (US$68.51 million including
a front-end fee of US$0.51 million) will be on-lent to the participating banks
(para 4.03) to provide the foreign exchange required to be contributed by these
banks and the other Egyptian shareholders for their subscription to shares in
ANSDIK. The on-lending terms for this part of the loan would be identical to
the terms of the Bank loan to the Government. The on-lending agreement will
also oblige the participating banks and the other Egyptian shareholders to make
reasonable efforts to diversify further the shareholding in the Company by
offering their shares to the general investing public. The conclusion of
satisfactory on-lending agreements between the Government and ANSDIK and the
participating banks is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. IFC will
provide to the Company a loan of US$95.2 million including US$31.2 million for
its own account and US$64 million from a syndicate of commercial banks
(participants). The IFC portion of the loan will be provided in US$ at a fixed
interest rate of 13.50% for a period of 13 years with repayment beginning no
later than 24 months after Project start-up. The participants portion of the
loan is also expected to be provided in US$ at an interest rate linked to the
six-month London inter-bank offering rate for a period of 10 years including
five years of grace. For the purpose of financial analysis, the interest on
this portion of the loan is assumed to be equivalent to the IFC interest rate.
6.08      The timely availability of the equity funds is critical to the
Project. The provision of the foreign exchange required to be contributed by
Egyptian shareholders is ensured through the portion of the Bank loan being
provided for this purpose. The Company's schedule for equity payments
(para 4.04) is fully satisfactory to meet the requirements of the Project.
WBG's agreements with the Company also require timely equity payments to enable
ANSDIK to maintain a debt to equity ratio of not more than 70:30 during the
construction period. Finally, the Government has agreed to ensure the timely
provision of equity funds through the public sector shareholders of ANSDIK.
6.09      The allocation of funds by sources to different Project items, shown
in Annex 6-2, has been designed to optimize the use of available sources of
finance consistent with their respective requirements and procurement
arrangements (paras 6.12 and 6.13).
C. Deficiency Financing
6.10      As envisaged under the Basic Agreement, the Egyptian shareholders, JC
and IFC would enter into a "Project Funds Agreement" to provide any necessary
10/ A Bank loan directly to a Law 43 Company is not legally feasible.
11/ Assumed in this report to be 10.97% per annum.
12/ Local commercial rates are: fixed rates on Bank funds on-lent through
development banks of 11-12% where the beneficiary bears the entire foreign
exchange risk (directly comparable to the proposed Bank loan).



- 38 -
deficiency funds resulting from a cost overrun and/or a shortfall in available
financing. Under this agreement, the need for the provision of deficiency funds
would be determined by WBG (represented by IFC); JC will be responsible for
providing 20% and the Egyptian shareholders 80% of any required funds, which
cannot otherwise be raised by the Company, on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IFC. The disproportionately higher share of JC in the deficiency financing
(20%) as compared to its ownership in the Company (10%) has been set with a view
to ensuring a high degree of JC commitment to keep the capital cost within the
budget.  This agreement covers such financing up to a maximum of US$100 million
over and above the US$800 million provided in the financing pilan (para 6.05),
and extends until six months following the availability of audited financial
statements as of the physical compLetion of the Project. Also, the Government
has agreed to ensure the availability to the Company through the
Government-owned shareholders, of the necessary funds (without limit) to
complete the Project, defined in this context as completion of relevant
performance tests and satisfactory operation of the principal facilities for 30
consecutive days at an operating rate of not less than 50%, on terms and
conditions consistent with the Company's financial obligations (para 7.10).
D. Procurement
6.11      The Project has been divided into 18 procurement packages (including
3 for civil and building works) excluding engineering services which are being
provided by JC as part of the Basic Agreement and goods to be financed under the
working capital category. The scope of the packages has been fully defined and
forms the basis of the capital cost estimate and the allocation of funds
(Annexes 6-1 and 6-2). With the exception of site preparation, temporary
facilities, inland transportation, the steelmaking plant and the direct
reduction plant, all contract packages will be submitted to international
competitive bidding (ICB). Goods financed under working capital (raw materials
and consumables) will be procured through limited international tendering in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
6.12      Site preparation, which has been completed, was contracted following
local competitive bidding. Temporary facilities, which were required early,
have been contracted following acceptable limited international bidding
procedures. The inland transportation contract will be awarded following
acceptable limited international tendering among qualified bidders. The
steelmaking plant will be supplied by JC, in recognition of its critical
importance and JC's expertise in steelmaking technology, as reflected in the
Basic Agreement (para 4.05). As also agreed, an independent consultant, British
Steel Corporation (Overseas Services) Ltd (BSCOS), reporting to the Chairman and
Managing Director has reviewed the scope and conditions of the contract and its
price. BSCOS's recommendations, designed to facilitate plant operation and
maintenance, have been fully discussed and incorporated in the contract where
appropriate. The price finally agreed, following discussions involving WBG, is
fully competitive. The direct reduction plant will be awarded following
competitive bidding between the licensees (both Japanese) of the Midrex and HyL
III processes, which are the two principal gas-based direct reduction processes
that are commercially available al: this time. The proposed arrangement
represents a step forward in the procurement of direct reduction plants; in view
of the territorial licensing agreements which apply to such plants, there have
been few, if any, instances of meaningful competition in the past.



- 39 -
6.13      All remaining packages (including all packages to be financed by the
Bank) will be submitted to ICB. Such an arrangement is possible because, in
addition to Bank and IFC financing, OECF financing is also untied. For the two
rolling mill packages, which are to be 80% financed through export credits, all
the prequalified bidders have confirmed the availability of such financing.
Prequalification reports, bidding documents, bid evaluation reports and contract
award recommenlations will be subject to prior review by WBG and will follow
procedures consistent with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
6.14      In packages where a JC member will be submitting bids, namely the
direct reduction plant and the two rolling mill plants, BSCOS has reviewed the
technical specifications and tender documents prepared by JC with the objective
of ensuring that all prequalified bidders have an opportunity to compete on
equal terms. BSCOS is also responsible, in these instances, for conducting
prebid meetings and undertaking the required bid evaluation.
6.15      Egyptian companies are expected to be prime contractors only for
off-site facilities (which form one of three civil and building works packages)
and, possibly, the rolling mill steel structures. For execution of the on-site
civil works packages, which comprise the critical facilities, experienced
foreign contractors selected through ICB are judged to be essential in order to
attain the quality standards and the construction schedule stipulated for the
Project (paras 5.09 and 5.10). Substantial Egyptian contractor participation in
these packages is expected; nine consortia of qualified Egyptian and foreign
contractors, with the latter retaining overall responsibility in each case, have
been prequalified for these packages.
E. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Group Funds
6.16      The allocation of the proposed Bank loan is shown below:
Allocation of Bank Funds
(US$ million)
Package                                      Amount          Application
Equipment for Rolling Mill Plants a/          63.4     100% of foreign exchange
and Ancillary Plants (substation,                    expenditure and 100% local
utilities, lime plant)                               expenditure ex-factory
Civil and Building Works                      56.8     45% of total expenditure b/

Unallocated                                   13.9
Total                                      165.3
a/ ANSDIK's contribution only; equivalent to the down payment.
b/ Percentage to be amended in view of the final split between the two on-site
civil works packages to be financed separately by the Bank and OECF
following joint procurement.



- 40 -
The proposed loan of US$95.2 million from IFC (and Participants) is envisaged to
be used, together with equity funds, to cover a part of the payment for the
installation package which is not covered by the Bank, and to finance
pre-production expenses, working capital, interest during construction (and in
the first year of operation) and contingencies. The rationale for this
allocation is that it involves either the Bank or IFC in the financing of all
significant packages.  The Egyptian shareholders consider this to be an
important feature since it provides for WBG overview of the pr-Ocurement of most
packages.
6.17       The projected schedule for the disbursement of Bank and IFC funds is
shown in Annex 6-3. The forecast period of disbursement of around 4-1/2 years
compares very favorably with the typical Bank profile of 6-1/2 years for
industrial projects in EMENA countries, 7 years for industrial projects in Egypt
(limited sample), and about 7-1/2 years for all projects in Egypt. The much
shorter disbursement period is projected with a high level of confidence based
on: (i) the very advanced state of preparation, engineering and procurement
actions relative to most other projects at this stage of Bank consideration
(para 5.09); (ii) the special implementation and management arrangements already
in place (para 5.10); and (iii) the contracting arrangements foreseen for
critical civil and building works 'para 6.15).
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production Buildup and Sales Forecast
7.01       The expected buildup of Project output has been determined based on
extensive discussions with the Company, JC and BSCOS, and on the experience of
similar facilities. For the purpose of Project analysis the nominal output
level of 745,000 tpy of finished products (excluding 9,000 tpy of short sizes)
has been assumed as full production. JC believes, and experience of the Qatar
Steel Company (QASCO), a very similar albeit smaller facility in Qatar (also
involving a member of JC and operated under a similar management arrangement),
suggests that the Project would be capable of reaching and sustaining a higher
output of around 800,000 tpy 13/. It should be noted that, under the
Management Agreement, the bonus payable to JC is tied to an agreed rate of
production buildup reaching a level of 760,000 tpy (i.e., higher than the
assumed full production) in the third year.  The Project would need to exceed
this level of output in order for JC to earn a production bonus in place of any
"profit" on its management services; otherwise JC would be limited to
reimbursement of its cost (salaries and allowances for personnel and
out-of-pocket expenses) of providing these services. Also, BSCOS comments on the
technical specifications, aimed at facilitating the operation and maintenance
of the equipment, have been taken into account. In view of the above factors
and the foreseen management and training arrangements (paras 4.09 and 5.12), the
assumed full production level of 745,000 tpy is considered attainable and
capable of being exceeded.
13/ The assumed output level of 745,000 tpy is based on a steelmaking plant
availability of 82% (of a 365 working day year), a rolling mill
availability of 74% (of a 300 day year) and an operating efficiency of
88%. The higher output level (around 800,000 tpy) would require higher
levels of equipment availability and efficiency for a cumulative gain of
about 7%, and would rely on increased operator skill.



- 41 -
7.02      The buildup of production planned to lead up to the nominal output of
745,000 tpy (754,000 tpy including short sizes), used as the basis for the
financial and economic projections in this report, is shown in the following
table. Plans for an ultimate buildup to 800,000 tpy have also been developed by
JC. The production buildup pattern has been based on past experience with the
learning curves of the different facilities. As noted earlier, the start-up of
the different facilities is planned to be phased to take this factor into
account: the steelmaking plant is scheduled to start-up first, followed by the
bar mill 2 months later, and then the direct reduction plant and rod mill 4
months later than the bar mill (chart, para 5.09).

a/ Further increase in liquid steel output would rely on additional scrap.
b)/ Equivalent to 100% of nominal capacity.
7.03      In view of the availability of an adequate domestic market, and the
expected quality of the output which will be competitive with imports, the sales
forecast shown in the preceding table is determined directly from the production
buildup pattern after taking into account the need to establish required levels
of semi-finished and finished product inventories. The Company, with the
assistance of JC, is considering the available distribution and marketing
options (paras 3.41 and 3.42) including sales contracts with public sector
entities and direct sales to the market. In addition to the sales shown for
rebar, the Project would also dispose of the short sizes (defined as 6m to 12m
length) generated in the rolling process as noted previously, up to an amount of
9,000 tpy at full production.
7.04      Project revenues are derived from the sales volume forecast using the
rebar price projected to prevail at start-up (para 3.47). Minor changes in the
product mix are not expected to affect substantially the sales revenue, since a
lower production of premium sizes would be largely offset by a higher volume of
production. Short sizes are assumed to be sold at 90% of the price of full
length finished product; sale of DRI, in the first year, is assumed at the
projected price of scrap or US$147/ton (1982 terms).

B. Production Costs
7.05      The production costs for the Project have been assessed in detail as
part of the basic engineering and subsequently compared with experience at the
QASCO plant. Improvements in operations during the learning period are
reflected in declining unit consumption rates where appropriate. The material
balance and cost structure at full production is shown in Annex 7-1. Direct
production costs are summarized in the following table:
ANSDIK - Production Cost Structure at Production of 745,000 tpy a/

7.06      The yield and consumption coefficient assumptions used to develop the
cost structure have been checked against and are generally in line with results
achieved at the similar QASCO facility. The prices used for tradeable inputs
reflect prevailing international price levels projected for 1986, which are
generally higher (in 1982 terms) than present levels. Prices for energy inputs
are based on agreements reached through an exchange of letters between the
Company and the Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) and Egyptian General
Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). These prices to be applied at start-up,
US$0.029/KWH for electricity and US$2.30/m BTU for natural gas (in 1986 terms),
are substantially higher than those presently paid by large industrial users in
Egypt and fully in line with the WBG;'s objectives of urging a move towards
international prices in the energy sector in Egypt. The base case financial

analysis assumes further real increases in the above prices to reach economic
levels by 1995. Port-handling charges are assumed to be in line with the
analysis presented for the Port Project (SAR 3799a-EGT) but have not been
finally agreed. In order to ensure that the contracts for natural gas,
electricity and port services are satisfactory to the Bank, the Company has
agreed to seek the Bank's approval of these contracts.   Based on the above cost
structure, the Project is fully competitive in its direct production costs with
typical efficient producers in industrialized economies (table, para 3.25), and
derives a significant advantage from substantially lower labor costs.
C. Financial Projections and Analysis
7.07      The projected financial statements for the Company based on the sales
revenue and cost assumptions discussed above are detailed in Annex 7-2 along
with other detailed assumptions. The projections, summarized below, have been
made in current prices up to the first year of full production (FY90: year
ending October 31, 1990) and in constant end-1989 prices thereafter. 14/

7.08      The Company is expected to incur a substantial loss in the first year
of operation (FY87) leading to an operating cash flow deficit of US$35.6 million.
14/ All estimates have been prepared in US$, local costs being converted at the
current commercial bank exchange rate of LE 0.84=US$1.00; inflation rates
assumed are 8% per annum for 1982 and 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and
6% per annum between 1986-89.



- 44 -
The US$42.6 million provision for finance charges in the first year of
production (para 6.03) built into the financing plan is adequate to cover this
deficit. Profitability and cash flows are expected to improve progressively
thereafter reaching fully satisfactory levels in the third year of operations
(FY89). The equity is expected to be substantially eroded in the first year of
operation because of initial losses, but these losses are expected to be
recuperated by the third year of operations and healthy retained earnings built
up thereafter. The Company's debt service coverage is projected to reach
1.4 times in the second year and attain or exceed 2.0 times in subsequent
years. The Company's liquidity, as reflected in the current ratio, is projected
to reach a reasonably satisfactory level in the first year and improve
substantially thereafter, The ability of the Project to withstand lower
financial prices for its output has been assessed fully. If an international
rebar base price of US$300/ton in 1982 terms (as compared to the forecast
US$330/ton) were to prevail for the life of the Project, ANSDIK would still be
able to maintain a sound financial structure with reliance on some short-term
debt in the first two years of its operations. Under this scenario the
Company's debt to equity ratio would be better than 70:30 after FY89; its debt
service coverage would be 1.1, 1.4 and 1.8 in FY88, FY89 and FY90 respectively;
and its current ratio higher than 1.0 at all times.
7.09      The Company is assumed to be subject to the payment of a 32% income
tax from FY95 onwards, following an eight year tax holiday under incentives
available to some Law 43 joint ventures. Dividends should be possible starting
in the third year of operations by which time the Company is expected to reach
full production.
D. Financial Covenants
7.10      To maintain the financial soundness of the Company, agreements have
been obtained by the Bank and IFC that ANSDIK will (i) not declare or pay
dividends unless, after payment of such dividends: (a) it would continue to
maintain positive accumulated retained earnings; (b) its debt to equity ratio
would be below 70:30; and (c) its current ratio would exceed 1.3; (ii) not
incur, without the prior approval of WBG, (a) any additional long-term debt (not
foreseen in the financing plan) if, after incurring such debt, its debt to
equity ratio would exceed 70:30 or its projected debt-service coverage would
fall below 1.5 times and (b) short-term debt in excess of 70% of the value of
its inventories and receivables after December 31, 1987; (iii) take all steps
necessary to maintain at all times after December 31, 1987 a current ratio of at
least 1.2; and (iv) not undertake in zny year investment (not foreseen in the
Project) exceeding US$5 million, fcrm subsidiaries, or enter into any
partnerships without prior approval of WBG. Finally, the Government has: (i)
agreed to ensure that the Government-owned shareholders fulfill their
obligations with regard to the above requirements; and (ii) confirmed its
earlier commitments made to the Company and through IMC (the Egyptian Project
sponsor) in the Basic Agreement to enable the Company to secure the foreign
exchange in the amounts required tc service its debt and for its operations.
E. Financial Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.11      The pre-tax financial return on total investment (FRR) is estimated to
be about 13% in real terms. The return on equity (ROE) for the life of the
Project based on the projected dividend stream and re dual book value, is
estimated at around 15% in real terms. 15/  The ROE    _  on a sale of shares
15/ Inflation beyond FY90, if taken into accounit, would increase the ROE in
real terms due to the fixed nature of the debt service obligations.



- 45 -
at book value after nine years of operation -- about one-half through Project
life -- is estimated at about 13%. The latter ROE is lower due to early losses
and the expectation of no dividends in the initial years of operation. The FRR
and ROE are considered adequate for a project of this nature. The cost and
benefit streams for this analysis are shown in Annex 7-3.
7.12       Based on the cost structure of the Project, its profit break-even in
FY90 is estimated at 77% of the projected selling price and 53% of the projected
output level. Cash break-evens (including debt repayment) amount to 78% (i.e.,
around US$330/ton of rebar as against the projected US$425/ton) and 57% (i.e.,
output of 425,000 tpy as against the projected 745,000 tpy) respectively.
7.13       The principal Project risks (addressed in greater depth in the
following section) are: (i) implementation delays; (ii) capital cost overruns;
(iii) lower output levels; (iv) lower output prices, particularly in the initial
years; and (v) from the financial perspective only, higher prices for energy
inputs. The impact of these risks on the Project's financial profitability and
its debt service capacity is summarized in the following table.

service coverage.

The above risks, equally relevant to the economic analysis of the Project, and
the safeguards incorporated in the Project are discussed in the following
section. The Company is expected to be protected from the risk of artificially
low (i.e., subsidized) financial prices of imported rebar through Egypt's
existing policy of levying tariffs (up to 20%) on such imports. The base case
assumes prices of natural gas and power to reach economic levels by 1995
(para 7.06). Since the price of output is assumed also at economic levels while
import duties are payable on imported inputs, this would imply, conservatively,
negative protection for the Project after 1995.
F. Major Risks
7.14       Before describing the major Project risks, it should be emphasized
that the market for its-output, which tends to be a dominant risk for steel
projects, is firmly based. All recent supply and demand projections carried out
in Egypt (as recently as August 1982) conclude that the domestic market would be
able to absorb the entire output of the Project, even if output were to reach
the upper bound of around 800,000 tpy, and still need to rely on imports
(table, para 3.36). The rolling mill configuration of the Project provides
adequate flexibility to respond to shifts in the size-mix of rebar demand. The
major risks relate to implementation delays, capital cost overruns, a lower
output level and lower rebar prices.
7.15       The implementation period assumed for the Project is short relative
to past project experience in Egypt. In assessing the likelihood of variances
from this schedule, the following factors need to be considered: the validity of
the schedule itself, reasons for delays in the past, and the effectiveness of
the proposed implementation management arrangements. The schedule proposed by
JC has been reviewed in detail and some margins added as a contingency
(para 5.09). Progress to date on site preparation and infrastructure works is
in line with the Project schedule. JC has little doubt that the proposed
Project schedule can be met or even surpassed. Past delays in Egypt have
resulted from lack of timely availability of foreign exchange and inadequate
performance by Egyptian construction companies (para 2.05); additionally, delays
in building up the momentum of the implementation process have added several
months to the schedule in past projects. Under the Project these risks are
adequately covered. All critical civil and building works are to be carried out
(after ICB) by joint ventures between prequalified overseas and Egyptian
contractors, and are to be co-financed by OECF and IBRD; the procurement process
is well advanced and starting delays are not expected (para 6.17). The risk is
thus reduced to delays between start of procurement and completion of the
Project, i.e., to the capability of ANSDIK management (supported by JC) to
control and manage implementation. While JC has demonstrated its capability in
projects in other countries, its effectiveness in Egypt, possibly working with
non-Japanese suppliers and contractors (including some reliance on local
supplies), has not been tested. The ANSDIK management team, including JC
personnel, combines extensive implementation experience in Egypt and overseas
(para 5.10). In view of these factors, the proposed schedule is judged to be
reasonable. While longer delays due to unforeseen circumstances cannot be ruled
out, a delay of more than six months is considered unlikely.
7.16       The capital cost estimates are based on an advanced state of
engineering and supported by JC's extensive experience, also as a manufacturer
of all the major plants. The estimates prepared in Yen have been converted at
the rate of US$1:Yen 230 (para 6.02). While this provides some cushion



- 47 -
against Yen appreciation from present levels vis-a-vis the US$, the likelihood
or impact of further changes are difficult to foresee and are not addressed in
this discussion. As already demonstrated for the steelmaking plant, actual
amounts for major plant contracts, i.e., where JC is likely to bid, are expected
to lie within the estimates with a high degree of confidence (para 6.02). In
view of the advanced state of preparation, the scope of the civil and building
works, which is normally the area where major cost overruns occur in steel
projects, is more closely defined than is usual at this stage in WBG's
consideration; nevertheless a 10% physical contingency has been provided.
Adequate provisions have also been included for insurance, freight, installation
and other contingencies (paras 6.02 and 6.03). In view of these factors and the
management considerations discussed in the preceding paragraph, significant
capital cost overruns are not expected. An overrun exceeding 10% is considered
unlikely and is more than adequately provided for in the agreed deficiency
financing arrangements (para 6.10).
7.17       The risk of a lower output level than projected is essentially
related to the risk that JC may not be fully effective in transferring its
technical and managerial know-how to the Company. A related issue is the
ability of the Company to retain newly trained Egyptian managerial, operating
and maintenance personnel. These risks could prevent the Company from achieving
and then sustaining high levels of production. First, the risk of less than
fully effective transfer of know-how is accounted for in the level of output
assumed for the analysis i.e., 745,000 tpy as against an ultimate production
capability of around 800,000 tpy (para 7.01). Second, Japanese steel companies
have a highly successful track record as equity partners in overseas steel
projects, such as USIMINAS in Brazil (Bank Loan No. 812-BR), Malayawata in
Malaysia (IFC Investment Agreement No. 127-MA) and most recently, in QASCO;
however, there are no precedents in Egypt. Also, there is little doubt, and to
some extent the long gestation period of the Project is a reflection of this,
that JC is taking its responsibilities as equity partner and in providing
engineering/management services seriously; the JC companies appear to have made
a corporate commitment to the success of the Project. Third, WBG has been
conscious of this risk since Project inception and has been instrumental in
designing the partnership and management arrangements whereby at least during
the first 5 years of operations, day-to-day management of the plant will be
vested in JC (para 4.09). Additionally, substantial incentives have been
provided to ensure a rapid production buildup to a higher level (over
760,000 tpy) based on an effective transfer of systems/know-how to Egyptian
personnel (para 7.01). Fourth, the employment policies and salary structure of
the Company have been formulated to attract and retain competent people
(para 5.11); adequate training will be assured (para 5.12). Finally, agreement
has been reached to provide for extension of the Management Agreement, and under
it retention of JC personnel in the Company, if deemed necessary (para 4.10).
Nonetheless, despite the above safeguards, the risk of not achieving the
operational and management efficiency required to attain the projected level of
output and sustain it beyond the duration of the Management Agreement cannot be
overlooked. At the same time the prospect of exceeding projected output and
sustaining a production level of 800,000 tpy also exists. Overall, the
probability of actual production in the first five years falling below the
projected level by more than 5-10% is judged to be low. There is a higher
likelihood that the Management Agreement will need to be extended to sustain
production at a high level.
7.18       The Project is most sensitive to the risk of rebar prices being lower
than forecast. While recent forecasts detailed in the market chapter foresee an



- 48 -
upturn in the international steel market in 1985-86, a possible delay in
recovery from the present depressed situation cannot be ruled out. The assumed
price is based on the cost of efficient production worldwide. The recovery by
1985-86 is premised on the availability of rebar for export coming into better
balance with steadily increasing demand, particularly in the developing
economies. While this recovery could be slower than expected, the possibility
of prices remaining below projected levels for the long-run by more than 5%,
potentially the more serious risk, is judged to be acceptably low. It is
considered unlikely that the recovery would be delayed beyond the late 1980s;
the risk of a 2 year delay beyond start-up, i.e., to 1988, has been assessed as
part of the sensitivity analysis related to the financial and economic returns
of the Project. Continued cyclical prices are likely but are expected to
average out at the assumed level.
G. Auditing and Reporting
7.19      The auditors already appointed by the Company are acceptable to WBG.
The Company has agreed to submit to WBG: (i) audited annual financial
statements within four months of the end of each fiscal year; and (ii) other
periodic (monthly and quarterly) reports of the Project's progress and the
Company's operations and finances (the details of these reports have been
discussed and will be finalized following development of ANSDIK's management
information system). In addition, c:Lose follow-up of the Project is envisaged
through IFC's representative on the Company's Board (para 4.06) and periodic
supervision missions.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01        The economic analysis uses forecasts of international prices (for
Project output and all tradeable inpats) for 1986, the year when the Project is
expected to start production. Since the Project is directed entirely towards
meeting the rebar needs of the domestic market, rebar is valued at its
import-substitution benefit; the price forecasts used are based on long-term
levels derived from full costs of efficient producers (paras 3.25 to 3.29).
Real-term price changes anticipated through 1986 are incorporated for energy
inputs, scrap and iron oxide materials. Natural gas is shadow-priced at the
fuel oil equivalent (US$4.10/m BTU in 1982 terms) except between 1990-98 wherein
a moderate discount of around 25% is assumed in line with the Bank's projections
of economic prices based on Egypt's gas production potential and demand. 16/
Electric power is priced in line with the assumed natural gas prices at
US$0.054/KWH (comparable to US$4.10/m BTU). No real term price changes have
been assumed beyond 1986 based on the rationale that input price changes, e.g.,
for energy, would be offset by efficiency improvements and changes in the price
of the output. Analysis of past price trends shows that increases in energy
prices are passed on to steel product selling prices except in times when
capacity utilization rates are very low. Between 1973-79, the impact of
increased energy input prices of 45-50% was more than off-set by actual steel
price increases.
8.02       A useful operating life of 18 years and a residual scrap value of
10% of the plant is assumed for the Project. The raw material inventory
16/ Based on shadow prices derived from a long-run growth model under the
framework of the Trade Strategy and Investment Planning Study for Egypt.



- 49 -
component of working capital is included as an economic investment which is
recovered at the end of the Project. Finished goods inventory is conservatively
assumed to replace stocks of imported rebar that would otherwise be carried by
the country; it is expected that Egypt's rebar inventory requirements will
decline as imports are replaced by a source of stable domestic supply.
Investment in the mineral jetty attributable to the Project (excluding Stage II
for which no benefits are assumed) has been estimated at US$50 million, based on
the methodology applied for the Dikheila Port Project (SAR 3799a-EGT), and is
reflected as an economic cost.
B. Economic Return and Sensitivity Analysis
8.03        The base case economic return of the Project is estimated at about
12%. The cost and benefit streams used for the analysis are provided in
Annex 8-1. The sensitivity of the return to the risks discussed in the previous
chapter is shown in the following table:

a!  Scrap prices are assumed to move in parallel with rebar prices in line with
past trends thus moderating, partially, the impact of a change in rebar
prices by itself. Rebar base price refers to the price (including extras)
of 16mm rebar in the export market, and prior to freight charges, etc.
b/  10% lower in the first year and 5% lower in the second year of operations.

1990-98 shadow prices (para 8.01). If the economic prices of energy inputs
were to be lower, the economic return would improve.



- 50 -
8.04      As shown in the preceding table, there is little risk of the return
falling below 10% based on adverse changes (up to the maximum likely change) in
single risk elements. Under a combination of adverse circumstances as shown
under "combined impact", the return would fall to about 10%.
C. Other Benefits and Sector Impact
8.05      The Project would assure a stable supply of rebar for the construction
industry; in the past such supply, which relied largely on imports and thus on
foreign exchange availability therefor, has constrained construction activities
and contributed to costly delays (para 2.05). It would thus eliminate the
problems of continued imports of rebar in increasingly large quantities which
would make Egypt among the largest importers of rebar in the world and thus
extremely vulnerable to swings in the market.
8.06       The direct foreign exchange benefits (excluding debt service) of the
Project are estimated at annual savings (in 1986 terms) of around US$205 million
annually in 1990, at full production (745,000 tpy). This compares with a
foreign exchange investment in fixed assets and pre-operating expenses of
US$527 million in current terms between 1983-86. A detailed foreign exchange
balance is presented in Annex 8-2.
8.07       The Project will provide direct employment to 1,835 persons and, as
can be expected for such basic industry projects, substantial additional
indirect employment.
8.08       The Project, through the sector development program (para 2.12), is
expected to result in a significant impact on the policies pertaining to the
steel sector and on its future development. The program will include the
formulation of appropriate policies for investment planning, distribution and
pricing as well as policies/measures for upgrading the management,
technological and manpower capabilities of existing public sector steel
companies. The planning and coordination of the future efficient development of
the steel industry, expected to result from the sector program, is also
important to downstream engineering industries (para 2.11). Further, the
Project is expected to lead to a transfer of managerial and steel industry
operating know-how to Egypt, the impact of which should over time be felt in the
operations of the entire industry. Finally, the expected success of this joint
venture undertaking under Law 43 (based on the long time that has elapsed to
bring it to fruition) would provide a model for the execution of similar large
scale projects in Egypt and thus allow the introduction of more efficient
project implementation and operatingt arrangements than have been possible in the
past.

ANNEX 3

THE OUTLOOK FOR LIGHT NON-FLAT PRODUCTS (LNFP) *
INTRODUCTION
1.        This Annex reviews the major factors currently influencing international
steel markets in general and LNFP in particular. It assesses both short-term and
medium-term prospects as well as cost and price trends. Within the broad spectrum
of steel products, the Annex focusses on the distinctive category of light
non-flat products (LNFP). 1/ Steel-producing countries are broadly categorized
into the "market economies" and the "centrally planned economies" (CPE's). 2/
Within the market economies, the industrialized economies (IE's) are treated
distinctly from the developing countries (DC's). 3/ The Annex emphasizes the
broad implications for DC investment in the steel industry, particularly in LNFP.
Amongst steel products in general, LNFP are unique. These unique features result
from differences in market, normal production methods, inputs used, and location
of production facilities. LNFP production is often the first step in the
establishment of a domestic iron and steel industry in DC's, and one where DC's
derive a particular home market comparative advantage in terms of lower labor
costs and the freight advantage vis-a-vis imports.
2.        This Annex is presented in three major sections, followed by a summary
of the major conclusions. The first reviews recent changes and likely
developments in steel markets in general. The second begins with the unique
features of LNFP and then discusses anticipated changes in the demand and supply
of LNFP. This second section also discusses the prospects for LNFP prices based
on an analysis of the structure of production costs of efficient LNFP producers in
IE's and other factors that determine prices. The third section analyzes the
incentive for DC production of LNFP, based on their production costs relative to
those in the IE's, and the transport costs incurred with importation.
I. WORLD STEEL DEMAND AND SUPPLY
A. Consumption/Demand
1. Past Consumption
3.        Historical steel consumption 4/ in the world is detailed in
Attachment 1 and summarized in the following table.
* This Annex was prepared by Messrs. Barnett (Industry Department) and Hashimoto,
updating and significantly revising an earlier report prepared by Messrs.
Meunier, Nadkarni, Sood, (Industry Department) and Hashimoto (Economic Analysis
and Projections Department).
1/ Wire rods, rebars, merchant bars and light sections (less than 80mm).
2/ Including the People's Republic of China, unless specifically noted otherwise.
3/ IE's: OECD countries excluding Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey (which are
classified as DC's).
4/ Throughout this section, steel is measured in terms of crude (first solid
form) steel. The conversion factor of crude steel to finished steel products
had been relatively stable until the mid-1970s, but has begun to vary as more
crude steel is continuously cast. Thus, the relevancy of crude steel as a
common denominator has diminished; however, no commonly used alternative has
yet gained acceptance.

4.        IE's, which accounted for 70% of total steel consumption in all market
economies in 1982, play a decisive role in determining the overall future trend of
steel demand. As shown above, steel consumption in the IE's grew at an average
annual rate of 3.6% from 1960-74/75. Since then, consumption has declined and has
yet to recover to the high levels reached in 1973 (403 million tons) and 1974
(391 million tons). The adverse developments after 1974 are primarily
attributable to:
(i)  A decline in the GDP growth rates from an overall average for all
IE's from 5.1% between 1960-73 to 2.5% between 1974/75-1980/82; and a
slower growth in the steel-consuming fixed capital formation activities
relative to other sectors of the economy;
(ii)  A decline (or savings) in steel usage in some key steel-consuming
industries, especially the automotive industry where steel consumption
per automobile has declined sharply; and
(iii)  An improvement in yield resulting from a widening diffusion of
continuous casting from a 10.9% share of crude steel production (in the
US, Japan and the EC) in 1973 to 50% in 1982. 5/
As a result of these factors, the ratio of steel consumption growth to GDP in the
IE's has been declining, especially since 1973-74. These factors are expected to
continue influencing steel demand growth in the forthcoming years.
5/  With ever higher yields in producing finished steel products from crude steel,
steel demand growth expressed in terms of crude steel will be lower, other
things being equal, than growth in finished steel products. In this respect,
the outstanding development is the diffusion of continuous casting, which
allows many traditional steps to be by-passed; ingot teeming, stripping;
soaking and primary rolling are no longer required. A shift of production of,
for example, ten tons of crude steel from ingot casting to continuous casting
would save one ton of crude steel.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
2. Future Demand
5.        For the IE's, based on moderate GDP growth projections 6/, steel demand
in these countries is projected at 345 million tons in 1985, and 365 million tons
in 1990 as compared to an average steel consumption of 321 million tons in 1980,
81 and 82 (1980-82). This growth in steel demand is expected to result from
efforts to improve capital formation, from the depressed levels of the late
1970s. Despite this growth, steel demand in IE's would still be well below the
historical peak reached in 1973 and 1974 (para 4). The implied average annual
growth rate of steel demand between 1980/82 and 1985 is 1.8% while between 1985
and 1990 it is 1.1%.
6.        For the DC's, steel demand has shown stronger growth, although at a
decelerating rate since the 1970s. Between 1960 and 1974-75, steel demand in the
DC's grew at an annual rate of 9.3%, compared to 5% thereafter to 1980-82.
Because of accumulated debt burdens and high carrying charges in some developing
economies, a further slowing of growth in steel demand in DC's as a group is
expected. Steel demand in the DC's is projected to reach 145 million tons in
1985, and 170 million tons in 1990, as compared to 125 million tons in 1980-82.
7.        Steel demand in the CPE's has grown at an average annual rate of around
1.5% between 1974/75-80/82 and is estimated to have reached 253 million tons in
1980-82. It is projected to grow at an average annual rate of around 1.2% to a
level of 265 million tons in 1985, and thereafter at 1.1% through 1990.
8.        The following table summarizes the above steel demand projections:

B.  Supply
9.        Historical data on world steel production capacity and production are
summarized in the following tables. During the early 1970s, the world steel
industry held an optimistic outlook for steel demand during the decade. As a
result, substantial net additions to capacity were planned and implemented, except
in the US. 7/ The upsurge in demand in 1973-74 (para 4) strengthened the
industry's belief of a continuing rapid growth in demand.
6/  2.8% per annum, i.e., the low case assumed in the World Development Report
(WDR) 1982.
7/  The US steel industry has maintained a cautious approach to capacity
expansion, possibly based on a slow-down in growth of domestic demand, as well
as a declining comparative advantage in steel production. The slowdown in
demand began earlier in the US (mid-60s) than in the EC or Japan (around
1970).

10.           However,  after  1974,  in  part  as  a  consequence  of  the  effects  of  the
energy crisis, consumption and production stagnated while capacity continued to
expand because of projects committed earlier. As a result, the capacity
utilization rate in the major steel producing countries fell substantially, as
shown in the following table. In the US steel industry the capacity utilization
rate has also been adversely affected by substantial imports 8/ from Japan, the
EC and to a minor extent from some DC's. In 1982, as a result of a major
recession, US capacity utilization rates averaged about 50%. This compares to
about 70% in Japan, 67% in the EC and 64% in all IE's.

Page 5
11.       The impact of the slow market growth in steel since 1974, and the
measures adopted to cope with it, differed across the major steel-producing
regions. The US Government introduced, in 1978, the trigger price mechanism,
which temporarily had some effect in restraining imports into the US (by setting
minimum prices for imports), but ultimately, under the pressure of weak world
markets and the strong US$, was superceded by agreed limits on imports from the EC
and Japan. The EC steel industry, unlike the US which enjoyed a utilization rate
of around 95% in 1979, has not achieved a capacity utilization rate higher than
80% since 1975; and in 1982 the utilization rate in the EC was, as noted, about
67%. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) declared a "manifest crisis" as
specified in Article 58 of the ECSC treaty 9/, and has been applying production
quotas for individual steelmakers and intensifying bilateral negotiations with
steel-exporting countries to continue to curb steel imports into the EC. In order
to help restore a long-term balance of demand and production capacity, the ECSC is
now accelerating its rationalization programs, which include a request for
substantial closures of obsolete production facilities. Japanese producers have
not been as aggressive in the export markets as before, despite their low capacity
utilization rate (around 70% in 1982). Instead, Japanese producers have
concentrated on cost-saving investments, which are expected to continue in the
coming years; no net additions of steel capacity are planned in Japan at least
through 1985.
12.       The low capacity utilization rates prevailing in the IE's in the late
1970s, combined with low prices and in part with the use of outmoded plant and
facilities, have severely strained the profitability of steel companies, and in
Europe have resulted in major losses. As a result, steel companies in these
economies have shut down some existing production facilities. While 1978-79
marked a period of recovery, steel demand since 1980 has decreased sharply in the
US and the EC. In light of their continued poor profitability and the resulting
strain on their financial resources, many steel companies in the US and the EC are
contemplating further plant closures.
13.       An analysis of available plans and the factors enumerated above
indicate that anticipated closures combined with little addition of new capacity
would result in a net reduction in effective capacity in the IE's of about 20
million tpy between 1982-85. In the same period, based on known plans, an
additional capacity of about 27 million tpy will be installed in the DC's by
1985. Thus the (effective) production capacity in market economies is expected to
reach 583 million tpy in 1985, as compared to 576 million tpy in 1982 (table
para 9).
C. Prospects for Capacity Utilization
14.       The projections for growth of demand and production capacity in the
world steel industry were shown in the earlier tables. Projections for growth in
production and capacity utilization are shown in the following table.

1990. Further, if net exports to CPE's are assumed to be around 5 million tons
per annum in 1985, and none in 1990 1/3/, the required production in the market
economies would reach around 495 million tons in 1985 and 535 million tons  in
1990 compared to 436 million tons in 1980-82 representing an average annual
increase of 3.2% to 1985 and 1.6% from 1985 to 1990. Total production capacity is
projected to reach 583 million tons in 1985, and 595 million tons in 1990. These
projections are generally in line with those made by various institutions. 11-
16.       The projected narrowing of -the gap between installed capacity and
required production as shown in the preceding table is expected to result in a
significant improvement over the demanad-capacity relationship that has prevailed
in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a result of this improvement, the average
capacity utilization rate in the market economies is expected to increase
significantly from around 67%, estimated to have been achieved in 1982, to 83% in
1985 and around 90% in 1990. As disclussed below, this improvement in capacity
utilization rates is expected to support an upward movement in steel prices.
Through this period, the DC's are expected to remain substantial net importers of
steel, with their import dependence down from an estimated 39 million tons in 1982
to 32 million tpy in 1985 and 37 million tpy in 1990.
10/ Steel imports into CPE's (including China) between 1974-81 have averaged
around 10 million tpy.

II. PROSPECTS FOR LIGHT NON-FLAT PRODUCTS (LNFP)
A. Uniqueness of Light Non-Flat Products (LNFP)
17.        Steel is often treated as a homogeneous product but this perspective is
misleading. There are many steel products, with significant differences in
physical and mechanical properties, intended for vastly different markets. Within
this diverse spectrum of steel products LNFP as a group must clearly be
distinguished from other products. This differential is emphasized by the fact
that in 1981, 31% of steel consumption in DC's was LNFP versus 20% in IE's.
18.        The structural changes ongoing in the world economy, accelerated by the
higher energy prices, which are decreasing steel consumption in some key
industries, such as the automotive industry (para 4) bear most heavily upon flat
rolled products. LNFP are largely consumed by industries related to
construction. These latter industries have been heavily impacted by the current
recession in IE's, but are to a greater degree immune from the longer term
structural changes referred to earlier. These industries are generally among the
fastest growing industries in DC's.
19.       LNFP are mostly produced either in small-scale privately owned electric
arc furnace (EF) operations (which rely on scrap, and/or directly reduced iron
(DRI)), or by rerolling mills (which rely on purchased billets). LNFP are
generally not produced by mature, large-scale integrated plants which are
presently, in a number of instances, subsidized and financially troubled. While
the smaller mills have been hurt by the current recession, virtually no government
assistance has been provided to them, or is expected. In the US, large-scale
integrated iron and steel mills such as US Steel and Bethlehem produce only small
amounts of LNFP and emphasize the higher qualities. Most of US LNFP is currently
produced by highly efficient, small-scale, scrap-based mills, which are often
called "mini or market-mills", relying on local scrap. Those mini-mills are
expected to remain highly competitive and to expand their capacity in the future,
when demand picks up. Similarly in Japan, the large-scale integrated mills such
as Nippon Steel, Nippon Kokan, Kawasaki and Sumitomo produce only high-quality
LNFP products. Most LNFP are produced by small-scale scrap-based mills. In the
EC, the transition of LNFP production to small-scale mills has lagged behind that
in the US and Japan, in part because of subsidies which have enabled continued
integrated production of these products, but the transition is taking place. The
EC trends are complicated by changes in the geographical location of LNFP
production from Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Luxembourg,
to Italy. This reflects the impact of the dynamic Bresciani mills. 12/ The
regional restructuring in LNFP production, as seen in the EC countries, is
evidence of a global restructuring which is anticipated to shift the weight of
LNFP production from established steel-producing areas to the DC's in the future.
The ECSC plans, for example, indicate that the EC as a whole will reduce capacity
for the production of LNFP more severely than that for other steel products.
12/ Small-scale steel mills in the Province of Brescia, Italy, called the
Bresciani, and considered among the world's most competitive producers of
LNFP, particularly rebars. The Bresciani account for more than two-thirds of
Italy's rebar production. Their competitiveness is attributable to various
factors, among which the most noticeable are the modest size of companies,
family management and relatively low labor costs. Also important is their
prompt adoption of new technology. For example, they started to install
continuous casting only in 1967, but in 1978 it accounted for nearly 100% of
their steel production capacity. Now they are diversifying into more
sophisticated products - from traditional rebars to wire rods and light
sections.

20.        LNFP are low-valued products in comparison with other steel products; as
a consequence, the percentage share of transportation costs to prices is higher
than that for other steel products. (For example, the percentage share of
transportation costs for rebars exported from the EC to the Middle East was
estimated at about 20% in 1982, as compared to about 10% in cold-rolled steel
sheets traded between those regions.) The burden of transportation costs
justifies the locations of LNFP mil:Ls in the neighborhood of the centers of its
final consumption. Furthermore, the major input for LNFP is scrap, which also has
a high ratio of transportation cost to price; thus, LNFP production largely relies
on local scrap supply. As a result, small-scale LNFP producers locate near their
markets (to serve local construction and civil engineering work) where there is a
local scrap supply. The market orienatation of LNFP production is true both
regionally (e.g., in the US) as well as internationally. Traditionally there had
been less international trade in LNFP than other steel products. A sharp increase
in LNFP trade took place only after the rapid economic growth of the oil-producing
countries in the mid-1970s triggered a sharp increase in demand for LNFP in those
countries where the production capacity was inadequate. As shown in the table of
the trade patterns (table, para 30) for 1969 and 1981, 6.9 million tons of LNFP
were internationally traded in 1969, as compared to 15.8 million tons in 1981.
The former figure represented 7.9% of the total production of LNFP in the market
economies in 1969, as compared to 14.2% in 1981. Actual and planned construction
of LNFP mills in the Middle East and North African countries reflect the rationale
of the market-oriented location of LNFP production. Thus, it can be anticipated
that the pre-1970 trade pattern of lower volume LNFP trade will reestablish
itself.
21.       The requisite production technology, for small-scale electric furnace
based production of LNFP, is normally not very complex, and the economic scale of
operations and corresponding capital requirements are relatively low. 13/ In view
of the generally readily available domestic market and relatively simple
technology, low scale and capital requirements, investment in LNFP production is
considered as the important first step in establishing a domestic iron and steel
industry. For example, some Japanese companies began as LNFP producers before
World War II, and became integrated steel companies in the 1950s.
B. Consumption and Production
22.        The historical consumption and production data for LNFP are detailed in
Attachments 2 and 3, and are summarized in the following table:
LNFP Consumption and Production a/

Page 9
23.       The share of LNFP in total steel demand is higher in the DC's, where
construction is the major steel consuming sector of the economy, than in the IE's
where the existence of large automotive, household appliance and engineering
industries leads to a proportionally larger demand for flat products. Normally,
the relative share of LNFP in total steel production is smaller at higher levels
of economic development, as evidenced by the DC's 1981 share of 30.5%, compared to
the IE's share of 21.3%. However, the energy crisis and its impact in promoting
structural changes, such as lighter and smaller cars have had proportionately
greater effects in decreasing flat rolled demand in IE's since 1974. Similarly,
developing countries have increased their relative use of LNFP as well. Of the
111 million tons of LNFP produced in the market economies in 1981, the IE's
account for 69% and the DC's for 31%. This 31% share is much higher than the DC's
share in the market economies' production of all steel (19% share), indicating a
relatively wide diffusion of light non-flat production in the DC's. Within the
DC's, Brazil, India, Spain and the Republic of Korea were, in 1981, the largest
producers of LNFP.
24.       As noted earlier, construction and associated industries are among the
fastest growing sectors of DC economies. Therefore, consumption of LNFP in the
DC's tends to grow more quickly than for all steel products. The pattern and
trend of light non-flat production in the IE's reflects the above differences in
demand growth and has important implications for DC's. The US, EC and Japan are
the largest LNFP producers accounting respectively for 17, 27 and 26 million tons
of production in 1981.
C. Future Demand and Supply of LNFP
25.       Historic data on LNFP capacity are not available, but estimates of
effective 1981 capacity are shown in the following table. Over the past decade
LNFP production has essentially shifted from large scale integrated (ore- and
coal-based) iron and steel plants to small scale scrap-based or DRI-based
mini-mills. Some of the older non-economic capacity still exists, although it
has largely been eliminated from the 1981 capacity estimates shown.

26.       Demand for LNFP is expected to increase at a faster rate in both IE's
and DC's than demand for steel as a whole. This reflects the fact that structural
adjustments are bearing most heavily on flat rolled products, and that the
implementation of new technology in steel production has been largely absorbed in
LNFP production, but is as yet not fully absorbed in flat rolled production.
Demand in IE's for LNFP is projected to grow by 2.0% annually to 1985,
1.5% annually thereafter through 1990. Thus total demand in IE's for LNFP is
expected to reach 77 million tons and 83 million tons in 1985 and 1990
respectively, as compared to 71 million tons in 1981. For developing economies
the faster pace of growth in LNFP demand than steel as a whole will continue, with
the former growing at about 4.3% a year through the 1980s, reaching 46 million
tons in 1985 and 57 million tons in 1990, as compared to 39 million tons in 1981.
In market economies as a whole growth in demand for LNFP would be about 2.8% in
the early 1980s and about 2.6% from 1985 to 1990.
27.       Capacity (effective) is projected to decline in IE's, for LNFP, from
106 million tons in 1981 to 99 million tons in 1985, and 98 million tons in 1990.
This reflects closure of primarily non-economic facilities, particularly in the
EC. Capacity is projected to rise in DC's reaching 45 million tons in 1985 and
57 million tons in 1990, as compared to 36 million tons in 1981. Overall in
market economies, capacity growth is not expected to keep pace with demand growth.
28.       The slower pace of growth in capacity than demand should improve
capacity utilization rates from a 1981 average of 78% in market economies, to
86% in 1985 and 90% in 1990. All of this improvement reflects a closer balance
between production and capacity in IE's whose capacity utilization rates are
likely to improve from 73% in 1981, to 84% in 1985 and 90% in 1990.
29.       Production in DC's in the 1980s, as shown in the following table, is
expected to continue to fall short of demand for LNFP and net imports will average
about 5 million tons a year. IE's should remain net exporters of LNFP, with
exports averaging 5 million tons a year, with approximately 1 million tons to
CPE's in 1985. This is further discussed below.

detailed data for 1981 are shown in Attachments 4 through 8. The trade patterns
for 1969 and 1981 are summarized in the following table. In 1981, some
15.8 million tons of LNFP were internationally traded as compared to 6.9 million
tons in 1969. 14/ This represented 14.2% of the total production of LNFP in the

31.       As shown, there have been dramatic increases in LNFP trade in the
1970s, both absolutely and as a share of production. LNFP are low cost products
and have historically not been traded in large quantities. However, following the
energy crisis and rapid growth of demand in the DC's, unmatched by increases in
their own capacity, imports especially by OPEC countries in the Middle East,
Africa and other DC's rose sharply. Nevertheless, close market orientation is
economic for these products. This is exemplified by the location of small-scale
producers of these products near the market -- often displacing integrated
suppliers. With increased market-oriented production capacity in those world
areas where demand is growing rapidly, the share of LNFP trade in the 1980s is
expected to decline, reverting to historic lower levels.

32.        The major exporters in 1981 were the Northern EC countries (exports to
third countries in 1981: 3.6 million tons); Italy (2.5); Japan (4.8); and Spain
(2.0). The major importers were countries in the Middle East (2.9 million tons);
US and Canada (1.8); the Northern EC countries (2.3); and North Africa (1.5). The
Middle East's total imports in the early 1970s were about 200,000 tons per year,
but reached 2.9 million tons in 1981. North Africa's imports also increased from
200,000 tons to 1.5 million tons annually in the same period. The DC's as a group
accounted for imports of 8 million tons, or 50.5% of total LNFP trade; some DC's
(e.g. Brazil and Korea) also export so that net DC imports were 5 million tons in
1981.
33.        In addition to exports to other European countries, the EC's exports
were mainly destined for the Middle East, China, North Africa and the US. Spain's
export pattern is similar to that of the EC. Japan's exports have been largely
destined for Asia, the Middle East and the US. Japan's exports to another
thriving market, i.e. North Africa, were small.
2. Trade Forecasts for LNFP
34.        The projected growth rates for domestic demand of LNFP were shown
earlier as were projections of capacity and production for market economies. Net
imports by DC's are projected to be 4.6 million tons in 1985 and 1990. Some DC's
(e.g. Spain and Korea) export and are projected to continue to do so at a level of
about 2.8 million tpy so that total gross imports of LNFP in DC's will average
7.4 million tons in 1985 and 1990. Projected imports and exports by country, or
group of countries, are shown in the following table for 1985 and 1980.  Trade in
LNFP is expected to decline, both absolutely, and relatively to production, in the
1980s, as the historic tendency to domestic self-sufficiency in LNFP reasserts
itself, with new capacity being built in DC's.

E. Prices of LNFP
35.       The demand for and prices of LNFP which, as noted previously, are
primarily used in construction activities, fluctuate with the cycles of civil
construction. Additionally, since most non-flat production derives from
non-integrated producers using steel scrap as an input, the cost of production and
hence, prices of LNFP also reflect scrap price fluctuations. This factor
introduces additional volatility in the prices of LNFP based on wide fluctuations
in scrap prices. Comparative trends in scrap prices (FOB US) and rebar export
prices (FOB Antwerp) are illustrated in the graph following para 38.
36.       Demand for flat products, used to a greater extent in the equipment and
consumer durables manufacturing industries, tends to be affected by the general
business cycle, particularly the rate of capital investment which tends to be more
stable than the civil construction investment rate. Therefore, flat product
prices are not as volatile as non-flat product prices.
1. Price Determinants
37.       Prices of steel products are determined largely by the following three
factors: (i) production costs including the impact of exchange rate variations
thereupon; (ii) market conditions and resulting capacity utilization rates; and
(iii) institutional factors and government policies.
38.       The following graph (see also Attachment 9) shows the relationship
between capacity utilization rates, and international steel prices for rebar since
1962, in 1982 US$. Price levels are generally set by costs. However, deviations
from this relationship result from changes in capacity utilization rates. At
times of low capacity utilization prices tend to fall, while at times of high
utilization, prices rise. The following paragraphs examine production costs,
market conditions and institutional factors and their likely impact of future
steel prices.

(i) Production Costs
39.       Although market conditions, as evidenced in capacity utilization,
influence prices, for the longer tern price levels are generally set by cost.
The inputs for LNFP (e.g. rebar), wh:ich as noted previously are largely produced
in scrap-based steel mills, comprise:: metallics (primarily scrap, ferro-alloys),
other materials, (electrodes and refractories); energy (electricity, oil and
natural gas); labor; items such as maintenance materials and spare parts; and
capital. The production cost structure discussion is intended to show trends in
the cost elements as they are likely to affect steel prices. The prospects for
prices of the principal inputs (in 1982 US$) are discussed below.
40.       The following table details the cost structure of two (of the four)
basic types of LNFP -- rebar and wire rod - of efficient producers in the US,
Japan and the EC. The costs shown include those for a normal product with typical
extras (for size and grade); all steel products have extras. There are two sets
of cost estimates: 1982 costs, whiclh reflect prevailing (depressed)economic
conditions; and projected normal costs which reflect projections of greater
normalcy in input and output prices, combined with higher rates of utilization and
increased efficiency over the next few years. It should be noted that all
estimates are in 1982 US$, but that for projected costs three alternate yen to US$
and DM to US$ exchange rates, were used. The impact of exchange rates on the
production cost and prices of LNFP (as well as other steel products) is
particularly significant. The elasticity of the cost structure in US$ to relative
exchange rate changes, at the parity levels shown in the following table, is
estimated at around 0.7 for Japan and 0.8 for the EC. Export prices of LNFP,
though largely determined in Japan and the EC (since the US is not a major
exporter), are also quoted in US$ and are thus directly affected by exchange rate
changes. Thus, at times (e.g., 1982) when the US$ is strong relative to the Yen
and the European currencies, export prices expressed in US$ appear unusually
depressed.

a/ The costs and prices prevailing in the Federal Republic of Germany have been
chosen as representative of the EC.
41.       The principal material input for LNFP is scrap.  In 1982, because of the
major worldwide recession, scrap prices in the US, the major worldwide scrap
supplier, were at an all-time low (in real terms) as illustrated in the graph
following para 38, covering the 1962-82 period. Prices for No. 1 heavy melting
scrap in the US in 1982 averaged US$63/ton, while those in Japan and the EC
averaged US$88/ton, and US$73/ton respectively; scrap prices in these three major
regions were well below normal levels in real terms. Over the 1962-81 period
scrap prices in the US (in 1982 US$) averaged US$111.50/ton. Over the shorter and
more recent period, 1972-81, US scrap prices averaged US$114.25/ton, while those
in Japan averaged US$128.25, and in the EC US$128.20. The US, Japan and EC
differentials evidence the normal disparity between US (net exporter of scrap)
prices and Japanese or EC (both net importers) scrap prices. These price



-68-                              ANNEX 3
Page 16
differentials of US$14/ton (1972-81) do not fully reflect transport cost from the
US to Japan or the EC, because despite imports, both of these latter two areas are
largely and increasingly self-sufficient in scrap. Under normal conditions,
transport from the US (West Coast) to Japan, or from the US (East Coast) to the EC
would be about US$20/ton, although in 1982, due to the recession, scrap transport
rates in the US$15/ton range were being quoted.
42.        Over the long term, scrap prices are projected to return to near their
historic normalcy in the US, i.e., a long term scrap price of US$105/ton for the
1980s in 1982 terms. Similarly, Japanese and EC scrap prices are expected to
average US$117/ton, and US$112/ton (at exchange rates of Yen 230 and DM 2.25 to
the US$) respectively. This represents a further narrowing of the Japan-US, and
especially EC-US scrap differentials, due to expected increased self-sufficiency.
The increase in real scrap prices from the 1982 lows, in all three regions,
reflects recovery of the respective steel markets and growing shares of steel
produced in scrap-based electric furnaces. For example, the share of electric
furnace steel production in the US is projected to increase from 28% in 1981 to
over 33% in 1985. These projected scrap prices are those used in estimating
normal production costs.
43.       The principal energy used in producing rebar and wire rods and other
LNFP is electricity. Real electricity prices are projected to rise in all areas
at about 2% a year in the 1980s. For steel production these increases will be
partially offset by increasing energy efficiency, especially in Japan and the EC.
44.       Other raw material and consumable costs (ferro-alloys, refractories,
etc.) are projected to rise slightly in real terms in all areas, more so in Japan
and the EC, but offset in part by increased efficiency in their use.
45.       Unit labor costs in all areas are projected to keep pace with general
price increases. Improved labor efficiency, and especially higher operating rates
(90% assumed for projected norms versus much lower levels in 1982) will reduce
labor usage sufficiently to decrease unit labor costs in steel production. The
cost reduction is estimated to be 10% in Japan and the EC (at Yen 230 to the US$,
and DM 2.25 to the US$) but 14% in the US. Other costs are assumed to keep pace
with inflation.
46.       Depreciation costs are assumed to fall slightly except in Japan, with
increased capital costs more than offset by higher operating rates and
efficiencies. Interest costs are projected to rise as maturing debt is refinanced
at higher rates.  In 1982 US LNFP producers' return on equity was below normal,
while some Japanese and EC producers were incurring losses. For the longer term,
normal opportunity profit must be earned and this implies higher steel prices, as
discussed below.
47.       The costs of production shown in the preceding table are for efficient
low cost producers in the respective countries. Under normal price
these producers may find it profitable to export some of their output, and,
addition, would earn above average rates of return because they would be competing
in the home market with less efficient producers. Comparative total costs for
integrated plants producing the same products are approximately 10% higher in
Japan, 15% higher in West Germany a,nd 30% higher in the US. The producers whose
costs are shown are small mills, subject to minimal government control or
protection, and thus come closest to representing the competitive ideal.

Page 17
48.       The costs shown above are representative of those for a normal mix of
product, both domestic and exports. However, the spot sold exported product is
not necessarily as good metallurgically (since it does not have to meet local
building standards or similarly stringent standards), does not have the same
services, and is not as precise in terms of size tolerances (5-1/2% deviation
versus 1-1/2% for the domestic). While the export versus domestic product
disparity applies to rebar price, it also represents differences in cost of
production. The price differential for export of rebar of untested quality has
normally been around US$20/ton and somewhat higher in recent years, being
influenced by increased price competition. For other LNFP the differentials are
less since domestic versus export quality differentials are smaller. On the
assumption that normal quality differences are reinstated in the 1980s, rebar
cost-based prices are projected at around US$335/ton in the domestic IE markets,
US$330/ton for the export of domestic quality product on a sustained basis in
large volumes, and US$315/ton for the spot sold exported product of untested
quality.
(ii) Market Conditions
49.       Market conditions, as evidenced in capacity utilization rates, are one
of the major determinants of world steel prices. At times of low capacity
utilization prices tend to fall, while at times of high utilization, prices rise.
This relationship in 1962-82 was illustrated in an earlier graph (para 38). From
that diagram it is clearly evident that high (low) operating rates correspond to
higher (lower) steel prices for one representative LNFP -- rebar. This
relationship is similar for all LNFP. In 1982, average capacity utilization rates
in the IE's were at their lowest level for years (around 64%) due to the
pronounced recession, leading, as one would expect, to depressed prices.
50.       As noted earlier, the world steel industry is projected to recover in
the 1980s, with capacity utilization in market economies averaging 85% in 1985,
and 90% in 1990. This is expected to strengthen steel prices, as discussed below.
(iii) Government Policies
51.       The governmental intervention mechanisms introduced in recent years,
such as the US voluntary restraint agreement, the EC's Davignon Plan and Japan's
Administrative Guidance System are designed to provide the basis for fair trading
in the IE steel industries, and act as a stabilizing and supporting influence for
the anticipated upward movement of steel prices. In the US, the Administration's
action is expected to help achieve higher capacity utilization with a strong
impact on domestic steel prices. In the EC, the Davignon Plan aims at a
rationalization and modernization of the steel industry partly by eliminating
obsolete capacity, thereby increasing competitiveness and discontinuing subsidies
to state-owned steel producers. Coupled with continuing curbs on steel imports
from non-EC countries, the EC capacity utilization rate is expected to improve
from its present low level. This in turn will support an improvement in domestic
prices. The overall impact of the increased government intervention is expected
to lead to the anticipated improvement in steel prices.
52.       With the anticipated tightening of the steel supply/demand situation by
the second half of the 1980s, as reflected in higher levels of capacity
utilization, and supported by the ongoing though expected temporary governmental
intervention mechanisms, international steel prices during the 1980s are expected
to move toward a level sufficient to cover full production costs and provide
normal opportunity profits.

53.       The 1982 recession, and the structural changes at work, have resulted in
EC government support of major integrated steel producers. (Smaller scale
mini-mills have not been similarly assisted.) This has had the unfortunate
consequence of encouraging integrated production of those products in which
mini-mills are the most cost-efficient suppliers. This put additional pressure on
EC mini-mills, already burdened by the recession.
2. Historic Prices
54.       Export prices (in 1982 US$) FOB Antwerp, for one LNFP, rebar, were
illustrated earlier (para 38). As shown, prices are highly volatile, falling to
an average of US$218/ton in 1982, but averaging US$330/ton over the past 20 years,
US$309/ton 1962 to 1971, US$351/ton 1972 to 1981, all in 1982 terms. While these
prices are linked to capacity utilizaLtion rates, the trend also reflects the
impact of the sharply higher energy prices (after 1973) on the production cost
structure subsequently offset by successful efforts to increase energy efficiency
and otherwise cut production costs. 1982 prices also reflect abnormal exchange
rate movements which enabled European, and Japanese exporters to cut the US$ price
of their products without as significant a reduction in the home currency prices
of their exported products.
55.       The prices shown, above and below (whether export or domestic) are
essentially for 16mm bar, inclusive of extras applicable to that size. Extras are
premiums charged to variations in the size, grade, and chemistry of a product. A
list of EC extras is shown below, for two rebar grades. These extras vary
substantially with the size and grade of the product, and no product is without
extras even though a base (plus extras) price is often quoted. The average quoted
EC extra for the typical (16mm) rebar product was US$30/ton in 1982. It should be
noted that for smaller diameter rebar (e.g. 10mm) the extras are substantially
higher, than for 16mm bar. It should also be noted that each of the products
shown normally have a different base price -- with that for Steel 52 about US$20
above that for Steel 37 in 1982 US$.

56.       Prices for rebar are representative of all LNFP.  The diagram below (see
also Attachment 10) illustrates trends in prices of three LNFP (rebar, merchant
bar and wire rod) exported from the EC over the period 1972 to 1982: Over the
1972 to 1981 period wire rod prices averaged 10% above rebar, while merchant bar



- 71 -                               ANNEX 3
Page 19
prices averaged 6% above rebar. Even in mini-mills it costs more to produce these
products than rebar. Nevertheless, as mini-mills capture more and more of the
wire rod and merchant bar markets, the inter-product price differentials as
related to rebar are expected to narrow to about 7% for wire rod and 4% for
merchant bar, as shown in the normal cost of production table for wire rod and
rebar (table, para 40).

On average, over this period, Japanese wire rod export prices were US$391 per ton,
while EC wire rod export prices averaged US$390 per ton. Thus whether considered
on an absolute basis or based on year to year price variations, international
steel prices for LNFP are very similar.
58.       Export prices for steel products tend to be more volatile than domestic
prices. The relationship between export prices and domestic prices for rebar is
shown in the following diagram (see also Attachment 12).

59.       The greater volatility of the exported products' prices is evident.  It
should also be noted, however, that the exported product tends on average to have
lower prices than the domestic product.  This in part reflects the more
competitive world market conditions versus domestic markets. For rebar, these
differences amount to approximately 10% in the EC over both the last 20 years and
the last 10 years; although over the last 5 years the differential widened to
almost 18%. To some extent, especially in the short-term, this differential
reflects price discounting of the exported product from the levels for the
equivalent quality domestic price; discounting made possible by protection of home
markets (necessitated by higher cost integrated producers). However, to a great
extent these differences reflect differences in product quality as discussed
earlier (para 48). According to European experts, these quality differences are
normally US$20/ton (6% of long-term normal rebar prices) for rebar. The
differential is slightly less for merchant bar, wire rod, and light structurals.
If one assumes a quality difference for rebar of US$20/ton, this takes up most of
the difference between long-term historic export and domestic rebar prices. The
remaining differential is 4%, reflecting price discounting on the exported
product. For shorter periods of time (e.g., the late 1970s), the differential
between the exported and the domestic product prices may be greater than can be
accounted for by quality differentials because of price discounting, or premium
prices, for the exported product. In the longer term exported prices for rebar
can be expected to be approximately 4% below domestic prices once the quality

Page 21
differential has been accounted for. The average discount on the exported product
of the EC, 1972 to 1982, was 10% for rebar, 7% for merchant bar, 5% for wire rod
applicable to spot sales and relatively small quantities. Japan's discounts were
comparable to those in the EC. For example, over the same period on wire rod the
same export discount of 5% applied. In contrast, for continuing foreign sales in
volume (equivalent to long term contracts) such discounts do not apply, anymore
than to the normal (continuing) domestic buyer, because essentially the same
quality product is provided to the foreign buyer as to the domestic. This is
evidenced in sales from Japan to Saudi Arabia of rebar between 1976 and 1981 --
there the exported product had the same quality as the domestic product and had
the same average price as the product purchased by domestic Japanese buyers.
3. Future Prices
60.       As noted earlier, in the longer term prices must cover costs and return
a normal profit. The table below compares opportunity cost covering prices of the
four major LNFP (wire rod, merchant bar, rebar and light structurals) to their
current and historic levels (1971-81). Current prices for all of these products
are far below their long term norms, and below full costs of production, because
of current very low operating rates in industrialized economies. As shown
earlier, market conditions are projected to improve from current depressed levels,
and the capacity utilization rates to rise significantly. If demand does not
increase, outmoded/high cost production capacity will be retired, and capacity
utilization rates will still rise. With higher capacity utilization rates will
come higher steel prices. For the longer term it is thus projected that steel
prices will return to near historic norms, covering production costs and enabling
realization of normal opportunity profit. Historic capacity utilization rates in
market economies have averaged 85%. By 1985 it is projected that this rate will
be reestablished in market economies and that by 1990 the average operating rate
will be 90% (para 28). This capacity utilization development suggests price
levels will increase to close to their long-term norms. However, because of
efficiency gains resulting from improvements in steel production and the
replacement of large scale integrated operations by small-scale electric furnace
techniques, real costs are expected to fall, and this is indicated by the
projected decrease in normal real export prices from the 1972-81 average of
US$351/ton. The savings are less for rebar, where mini-mills have been the major
suppliers since the mid 1970s, and more for wire rod and merchant bars, where
mini-mills have only recently begun to dominate the markets.

III.  THE INCENTIVE FOR DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF LNFP
61.        It was noted earlier that the historic pattern in LNFP had been for
small volume international trade, because of the high transport costs relative to
the value of the product. This pattern was disturbed in the 1970s when rapid
growth in DC's was not matched by increased capacity. There is, however, no
inherent production cost advantage iin IE production of LNFP, sufficient to offset
the cost of transport to DC's. Thus increased DC production of LNFP in the 1980s
is expected to restore the normal tendency toward self-sufficiency and low volume
of international trade.
62.        One of the incentives for DC production of LNFP, as with many other
products, is low hourly labor costs., Representative differences between DC and IE
hourly labor costs are illustrated in the table below. As the data indicate, DC's
often have hourly labor costs 70-90,' less than those in IE's, such as Japan or EC
countries. Thus despite lower labor productivity, this provides an advantage
which can offset disadvantages such as higher costs of materials (scrap and
consumables etc.).

63.        The other major, and more significant, incentive for domestic production
of LNFP in DC's derives from the freight advantage vis-a-vis imports. As noted
earlier (para 20), freight costs (and other import-related charges) for LNFP are
high relative to the value of these products. This results in a substantial
overall advantage when comparing the cost of domestic product to that of delivered
imports, as illustrated in the following table:

b/ Based on notional energy prices. Actual energy prices, not available, would
likely result in a much lower amount.
64.       As shown above, operating costs for the production of rebar are similar
in the DC's and IE's, the labor cost advantage offsetting higher costs in other
categories. It should be noted that the costs shown for Japan and the EC are
based on atypical 1982 exchange rates, and if adjusted to more typical exchange
rates would show a somewhat greater relative advantage for the DC's. Capital
charges in the DC facilities can be somewhat higher. As in the case of the Qatar
facility, this difference results from one or more of the following factors:
(i) the relative newness of the facility; (ii) the use of DRI-based production
which avoids dependence on imported scrap at the cost of a higher capital
intensity; and (iii) the higher cost associated with importing equipment and some
construction/erection services. A significant proportion of this differential is
explained by the first of the above factors. Since over the long term,
competition for the new DC facilities would have to come from IE facilities of
comparable vintage, this element of the capital charge differential would no
longer apply. The relevant comparison in evaluating the comparative advantage of
domestic production in the DC's (for import substitution) is that between the
cost of domestic production and the delivered cost of imports. As shown in the



- 76 -                          ANNEX 3
Page 24
preceding table, this comparison significantly favors the alternative of domestic
production. These factors and related considerations of reducing import-
dependence and realizing recurring foreign exchange savings encourage the domestic
installation of LNFP facilities in the DC's with an adequate domestic market. For
the long-term, this analysis supports the view that that LNFP trade will decline
as self-sufficiency, particularly in the large consumption centers, increases.
IV., CONCLUSION
65.       World steel markets are currently at depressed levels of capacity
utilization, especially in IE's, resulting in very low prices. This situation
represents the effect of the current worldwide recession, but also steel
intensity-reducing structural changes which, beginning in the early 1970s, have
permanently altered the relationship between steel consumption growth and GNP
growth in IE's. These structural changes were not anticipated, and capacity
additions were based on over-optimistic market forecasts, contributing to the
current excess capacity. Capacity ulilization is projected to improve as demand
recovers, and as excess capacity is reduced in IE's. However, slow growth is
projected for IE steel demand in the 1980s as these structural changes continue
kalthough at a reduced rate).  In contrast to IE's, developing countries, with low
steel intensity levels, have continued to experience rapid steel demand growth,
relative to GNP growth as they build their infrastructure and housing for growing
populations. Some slowing of DC's steel demand growth is likely, but continued
fairly high growth is still anticipat:ed.
66.       The 1980s should see considerably higher real prices than current levels
for LNFP. Price improvements from current levels will follow from higher real
costs for some inputs (e.g. scrap) and higher capacity utilization rates will
restore profitability to opportunity levels. Nevertheless, efficiency
improvements associated with continued emphasis on small-scale steelmaking
techniques, will keep long-term projected prices somewhat below historic norms.
67.       Spot export prices will conitinue below domestic levels, reflecting basic
differences in product qualities, and some slight discounting even in the longer
term. Exports on a continuing basis to buyers insisting on the same quality
standards as in IE's will continue at domestic price levels.
68.       The high freight and handling costs for imported LNFP, combined with
favorable DC experience in employing small-scale production techniques (production
costs difference from IE's being nornally less than the cost of transport) will
continue to encourage expanded DC production of LNFP. DC's, however, will remain
net importers of LNFP since their market growth is projected to exceed their
capacity expansion.

energy cost would increase by around US$37/ton (with a 25% discount, para

valuation, these increases would be partly offset by the elimination of
import duties ($16.46/ton) shown above.

Financial Projections and Assumptions
Assunptions
1.        The projections have been prepared in current dollars up to FY90 (full
production) and in constant end-1989 terms thereafter. Local currency revenues
and expenditures have been converted to US$ at the ccnmnercial bank exchange rate
of US$l:LE 0.84 and escalated in line with expected international inflation
rates: 1982 and 1983 - 8% per annum; 1984 - 7.5%; 1985 - 7%; and 1986-89 - 6%
per annum.
2.        output Level:  The assumed output level of 745,000 tpy is based on a
steelmaking plant availability of 82% (of a 365 working day year), a rolling
mill availability of 74% (of a 300 day year) and an operating efficiency of
88%. The higher output level (around 800,000 tpy) would require higher levels
of equipment availability and efficiency for a cumulative gain of around 7%, and
would rely on increased operator skill.
3.        Revenues and Production Costs:  Revenues are based on the sales
build-up discussed in para 7.02 and international prices projected in para
3.47.  The buildup of Project output prices, saxme as those used in the economic
analysis, is shown below:
Price of Project Output
(1982 US$)
US$/ton
Base Price with normnal extras (ex-works EC)            330
Freight to Alexandria                                    45
C&F Alexandria                                        375
Import-related charges (excluding duties/taxes)          25
Landed Base Price                                     400
Product Mix Premium (50% St 52)                          10
Size Premium (lOin vs. 16mrn)                            15
Project Price (Average)                               425
Production costs are based on consumption coefficients for all inputs and are
illustrated for full production, along with prices of inputs, in Annex 7-1.
Natural gas and electricity prices are based on agreements reached with the
utility authorities.  Import duties ranging between 8.74% - 16.98% for imported
inputs have been incorporated.
4.        Wages and benefits are based on the Conpany's planned schedule of
salaries for different categories of staff and include an allowance of 26% (of
salaries) for social benefits. Maintenance costs are forecast at 3% of fixed
asset costs. In line with Egyptian practise, straight line depreciation has
been assumed over the useful life of different categories of assets, as follows:



- 97 -                        ANNEX 7-2
Page 2
5 years for transportation equipment; 10 years for auxiliary equipment, 18 years
for production equipment, 33 years for plant buildings and 50 years for
administrative buildings. Land-lease payments of US$2 million annually are
included in the administrative expenses.
5.        Amortization:  Interest during construction and pre-operating expenses
are amortized over 10 years.
6.        Non-operating Income:  Surplus cash is assumed to be placed in
short-term deposits earning interest at the rate of 10% p.a.
7.        Income Tax:  Taxes are assumed at 32% of income following a 8-year
holiday.
8.        Dividend:  A dividend payout rate of 80% of income after taxes is
assumed.
9.        Working Capital:  The following assumptions, based on Project
requirements, are incorporated in the estimate of working capital:
Minimum Cash        :  2 weeks of operating costs excluding
depreciation
Accounts Receivable: 30 days of sales
Inventories
Raw Materials   :  1 month's requirements of locally procured raw
materials and scrap; 3 months of pellets and
lump ore; and 6 months of refractories and
electrodes
Work in Process : 1 week's requirement of billets
Finished Goods  :  15 days of output
Accounts Payable   : 60 days of cost of purchased inputs.
10.       The financial projections, based on the above assumptions, are
presented in the following financial statements.
