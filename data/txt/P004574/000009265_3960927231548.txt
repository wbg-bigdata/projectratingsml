MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE METROPOLITAN WATERWORKS AND SEWERAGE SYSTEM
FOR AN ANGAT WATER SUPPLY OPTIMIZATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), with the guarantee of the Republic of
the Philippines, for US$40 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would help
finance the proposed Angat Water Supply Optimization Project and would be for a term of 20
years, including a five-year grace period, at the Bank's standard variaole interest rate. The
project would be cofinanced by a US$130 million loan from the Asian i>velopment Bank (ADB)
for a term of 24 years, including a four-year grace period, at ADB's standard variable interest
rate, and by a Government equity contribution of US$80 million to be funded by a loan from
the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF).
2.         Background. The provision of water supply and sanitation services in 0.
Philippines has shown considerable improvement. Between 1980 and 1987 the population with
safe water (house connections or standpipes) increased from 45% to 63% of the total population.
During the period 1974-83 this sector improvement was supported by five Bank projects and six
ADB projects, which helped to establish sector institutions and strategies and financed the
implementation of sector developing plans. At end-1986, safe excreta disposal facilities were
provided to about 69% of all households nationwide, including 62% of the rural population and
80% of the urban population.
3.         Despite such improvements, however, service levels are still low relative to those
of other countries with comparable incomes. In the greater Metropolitan Manila area, for
example, only about 58% of the population has water supply connections, a service rate which
is lower than that of other capital cities of comparable size and importance. Extensive areas of
Metro Manila still lack distribution networks, and the quality of service in many areas is
inadequate, with low water pressures and rationed or intermittent supply.
4.         Water supply to the city of Manila and to 36 neighboring municipalities is provided
by MWSS. MWSS's Service Area (MSA) covers some 150,000 ha and has a population of some
9 million.
5.        The proposed project has therefore been designed to expand both the water
production and distribution capacity of MWSS. Production capacity would be increased by
optimizing the use of water resources available from MWSS's current supply source, the Angat
Multipurpose Dam, and distribution facilities would be expanded to provide water supply
through house connections to 75% of the MSA population by 1994.
6.         Rationale for Bank Involvement. In accordance with Bank strategy, the proposed
project supports Government efforts to improve the living conditions of the urban poor, promote
economic and social development by eliminating major water shortages, and improve
environmental conditions by providing safe water in the MSA. The project would strengthen
MWSS through the implementation of a four-year institutional development program (para. 11),
with particular emphasis on improved planning and financial performance, as well as better
operation and maintenance of water production and distribution facilities. The cofinancing with
ADB and OECF would ensure the achievement of common institutional and development
objectives by MWSS.
7.         Proiect Obiectives. The main objective of the project would be to meet the
expected water demand in MSA until the year 2000. The project has been designed to: (a)
increase MWSS's water production capacity; (b) provide 15 cubic meters per second (cums) of



water for an additional population of 3 million persons; (c) expand the distribution system to
Increase service coverage to 75% of MSA by 1994, particularly in poor neighborhoods;
(d) Improve the efficiency of MWSS's operations; and (e) strengthen MWSS's finances as well as
its planning and management information systems. The project would also reinforce and
complement efforts being made under two ongoing distribution system rehabilitation projects,
both financed by ADD, to reduce non-revenue water (NRW), i.e., water produced by not paid
for, which is largely due to system leakages, from the currently very high level of 55%.
S.         Proloot 2e1criotion. The project is part of an overall investment program for which
the Government has secured financing from different sources. The project incluldes construction
of raw water transmission, water treatment and distribution facilities for an additional supply of
15 cums, including engineering, and consists of the following:
Part A:    Transmission and Bulk Water SunnDv, comprising construction of: (i) tunnel No. 3
(about 6 km, 4.6 m diameter); (ii) aqueduct No. S in three sections, SA, SB and SC
(about 16 km, 3.6 m diameter); (iii) the second La Mesa by-pass (about 2.5 km,
3.6 m diameter); and (iv) water mains (about 35 km) to provide treated water
(1.1 cums) in bulk to eight municipalities in Bulacan Province.
EA1t13:   Water Source. Treatment and Distribution Facilities, comprising construction of:
(i) modification of the Angat power station; (ii) the La Mesa II treatment plant
(10.4 cums); (iii) a water reservoir (260,000 cu m);(iv) expansion of the primary and
secondary distribution system by about 420 kmi; (v) expansion of the tertiary
distribution system by about 100 km, including provision of about 345,000 service
connections; and (vi) telemetering.
Part C     Consultants' Services. Provision of engineering consultancy services for the project.
9.        Cofinancina Arrangemmi. Part A of the project would be financed by the Bank,
except for section SA of aqueduct No. 5, which will be financed locally. Parts B and C would
be cofinanced by ADB, except for items B (iii) and (iv), including respective consultancy services
in Part C, which would be financed by OECF.
10.        The project would be carried out in six years, and would be implemented by
MWSS's Project Office. Its total cost is estimated at US$291 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$152 million (52%). The total financing required, including interest
during construction, is US$362 million, of which the Bank would finance US$40 million, ADB
would finance US$130 million, OECF would finance US$80 million, MWSS's internal cash would
finance US$35 million, and local loans or other government contributions would finance
US$77 million. To accelerate project start-up and the elimination of water rationing in the
area, retroactive financing of the Bank loan, not to exceed US$4 million, is recommended for
expenditures made after May 1, 1989. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown
in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule for the
Bank-financed components are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7801-PH, is being distributed separately.
i1.        MWSS's Develooment Program. During 1989-92, MWSS would continue to develop
its institutional capabilities by carrying out a Development Program aimed at improving the
corporation's financial performance, planning and operating efficiency. The Program, which is
satisfactory to the Bank, has been approved by MWSS's management. The Program sets the



- 3 -
following water supply objectives to be achieved by end- 1992: (a) increase the population
served by house connections to 70%; (b) reduce NRW to less than 46%; (c) prevent further
leakage by improved specifications for meters, pipelines and pressure-reducing valves;
(d) improve staff efficiency; (e) provide training to about one third of all staff; (f) improve
billing and collection; (g) improve the tariff structure to make tariffs more affordable to the
urban poor; (h) maintain a satisfactory financial condition; (i) provide more uniform water
pressures throughout the MSA; (j) improve the management information system by including
delinquency reports, pending connections and other financial indicators; and (k) improve
operation and maintenance of the water system. For sewerage and drainage, MWSS intends to:
(a) improve services; (b) reduce pollution in MSA; and (c) assist the population living in areas
without sewerage services to gain access to adequate alfernative sanitation.
12.        Actions Aireed. The effectiveness of the Bank loan is conditional on the
effectiveness of the ADB loan. Assurances were obtained from the Government during
neaotiations that (a) an agreement on compensation between the National Power Corporation
(NPC) and MWSS for power losses would be concluded not later than December 31, 1990; while
compensation to NPC is studied and resolved, project construction would proceed as scheduled;
(b) adequate amounts will be included in the budgetary appropriations of national government
agencies and the operating budgets of government corporations for the payment of their water
and sewerage bills; (c) a substantial portion (60%) of the past due accounts receivable of MWSS
from local government units and government corporations would be settled by December 31,
1990; (d) by December 31, 1990, and thereafter, the accounts receivable of MWSS from national
government agencies will not exceed the aggregate amount of four months of their billing; and
(e) MWSS would be capitalized by equity contributions of US$80 million equivalent (expected
to be financed by an OECF loan). Assurances were obtained at neaotiations that MW$:
(a) would conclude an agreement for compensation to NPC for power losses not later than
December 31, 1990; (b) would reduce NRW to below 40% by 1994; (c) by December 31, 1993,
would improve its operational systems; (d) by December 31, 1990, would improve its customer
services, connection monitoring and reduce its accounts receivable to less than four months of
billing; (e) would review annually its tariffs to achieve a rate of return on its revalued net fixed
assets in operation of not less than 8% per year (an improved tariff structure for water and
sewerage was approved by MWSS's Board of Trustees in July 1989); (f) would maintain a debt-
service ratio no lower than 1.2; and (g) would prepare periodically updated reports on water
demand, monitoring indicators, long-term plans and financial projections.
13.        Justification. The project would maximize benefits from existing headwork
investments at the Angat Dam and thus postpone the need for construction of additional dam and
transmission system, which would require investments three times those of the proposed
optimization project. It would also provide urgently needed water to the Metropolitan Manila
area, which has about half of the country's industrial base, its commercial center and a
population of about 9 million people. The project would: (a) eliminate water rationing and low
pressures for about 5 million people who are already served; (b) distribute water supply benefits
to the entire MSA; (c) reduce the dependence of commercial and industrial consumers on deep
wells and excessive use of underground water, which is damaging the aquifer; (d) by restoring
normal pressures, decrease the potential health risk posed by sewage infiltration into
unpressurized distribution mains; and (e) by institutional improvements and the .mplementation
of MWSS's Development Program, strengthen one of the country's largest corporations, which
would influence other water utilities in the Philippines. The project has an estimated economic
rate of return of 15%.



-4-
14.        By 1994 about 1.6 million urban poor, 70% of the project beneficiaries (2.6 million),
would be provided with house connections. The provision of water by house connections would
free the urban poor, particularly women, from the arduous task of carrying 65 metric tons of
water per family per year. The total additional population receiving water by new house
connections would reach 4.3 million by the year 2000.
15.        BiAk   There are no unusual project risks.  The major risk, i.e., delayed
implementation of the various components which would postpone overall project comD letion by
one or more years, Is mitigated by MWSS's experience with similar works and the fact that the
raw water system, the critical component of the project, has already been contracted. When this
component is completed, any other completed works would produce immediate benefits by using
the existing facilities. It is estimated that even with two years' delay in construction, the
economic rate of return would still be 14%. Failure to reduce NRW would increase the cost of
water and reduce the population benefited. However, the results achieved in areas with
rehabilitated distribution systems indicate that the proposed NRW targets are achievable.
16.                ndctien. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
