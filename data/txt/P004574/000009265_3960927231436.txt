Loan and Project Summary
Borroen:          Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS).
Guaraut3on        Republic of the Philippines.
Deneficiaties:    The City of Manila and 36 neighboring municipalities.
US$40 moilion equivalent.
T-ems             20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bankes standard variable interest rate.
The proposed project would supply water to meet the expected water demand
in MWSS service area (MSA) until te . year 2000. The project has been designed
to: (a) increase MWSSs water production capacity; (b) provide 15 cubic meters
per second of water for an additional population of 3 million persons; (c) expand
the distnbution system to increase service coverage to 75% of the MSA by 1994,
particularly in poor neighborhoods; (d) improve the efficiency of MWSS's
operations; and (e) strengthen MWSS's finances as well as its planning and
management information systems. The project would be cofinanced by the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund
of Japan (OEC?), and includes the construction of water transmission, treatment
and distnbution facilities, ie. a 6 km tunnel, 18 km of aqueducts, 35 km of
water mains, 520 km of distnbution pipelines, a water treatment plant for 10.6
cubic meters per second, and a water reservoir (260,000 cubic meters). During
the project period, MWSS would continue to develop its institutional capabilities
by carrying out a satisfactory Development Program aimed at improving the
corporations's financial performance, planning and operating efficiency.
ad
Rid=          The project would maximize benefits from existing investments, postponing
alternatve investments costing three times those of the proposed project. It
would provide urgently needed water to the MSA, which has about half of the
county's industrial base, its commercial center and a population of about 9
million people. The project would: (a) eliminate water rationing and low
pressures for about 5 million people who are already served; (b) distnbute water
supply benefits to the entire MSA; (c reduce the dependence of commercial and
industrial consumers on deep welis and excessive use of underground water,
which is damaging the aquifer, (d) restore normal pressures, decreasing the
potential health risk posed by sewage infiltration into unpressurized distibution
mains; and (e) strengthen one of the countrys largest corporations, which
would influence other water utlities in the Philippines. There are no unusual
project risks. The major risk, ie., delayed implementaton of the various
components which could postpone overall project completion by one or more
years, is mitigated by MWSSs experience with similar works and the fact that
the raw water transmission system, the critcal component of the project, has
already been contracted. when this component is completed, any other completed
works would produce immediate benefits by using the existng facilities. Failure

Water Demand
PERCENTAGE SERVED WITH WATER BY MWSS      7.          There have been numerous studies of
water demand for Manla, including sophistcated
PR _       _        _ _  _ ft _ _ _analysis of income elasticity of different groups of
consumers, prce elasticity the effect of gross national
product, etc. However, all of them  have been
excessively optimistic in forecasting the water demand,
which did not materialize, even for the year when the
study was completed. Although there was a major
increase in water demand as a resut of the Manila ii
and Water Distnbution Projects, the increase in water
sales stabilized at a rate of about 5.5% p.a. (Figure 3).

that NRW can be reduced to less than 30%. Further
investigations indicate that part of the NRW problem
may result from the use of inaccurate and, more    I
important, overly large water meters. As a result of
these activities, NRW decline to 55% by mid-1989.
MWSS is aiming to reduce NRW to 43%-46% by 1992
and 37%40  by 1994 (Figure 9). Faster deJines

seasonal. While regression analysis of total and per
capita water sold shows that water sales would reach
about 38 milion cu m per month by the Year 1993,
the existence of rationing in the past which pent up

31 Based oan the differene in powr generated, becuse of a 30 t lower hydralic head (P 42 million) and loss of
peak generation (P 14 million). Peak generation at Angat is unreliable and vas avallable oaly one wek In 1987.
Therefore, additional peak capacity may have to be provided by IPC regardless of the project.
Moreover, this loss would increase gradually until the 15 cums are used. Under these circumstanes the
compenation for loss of peak capacity additional 9 eu m from Reiray will create ecenoiLe gain  of about 500
GWN at the sam prie, is estimated at P60 million per year (19'

financial projectios. The average iemental cst of P2/Ton Prducd Ln 1996 (P 2.7 per volume sold) is
used thereafter.
51 Difference with water sales in 1989 based tn demand show In Annex 2. The full production cpeeity is
used aw and al neastments to lncrease capacity or commections are included.

13 Assuming that the replacement of peak generation capacity would cost WS$40 milllon for full capacity
of 15 cums. The economic cost would be iln proportion to the incremental v-ter used. To allow for
construction, the cost is asumed two years earlier. GLven the continuous investments In power
generation, it is assume  that no lump iavstments vould be needed because of losses of
capacity in this project.
23 Based on average residentill demand of 38.6 towe/moath at P3.30 per ton, compared wlth water from
water vendors at PO.3 per 20 liters (P15 per ton). The consumer surplus for residential
users will be r1-1513.3)ILn(3.3S15)-2.3 the present tariff.
31 Asauming that about 301 of the incree In value of 1and In the project area to be served
(21,469 ha, 34X of NSA) is due to the availability of water. Observed price lncreases varled
from P132 to P232 per sq a. After the projet completion these benefits are distributed ln four years.
43  Based on the Feasibility Study (P99.6 million  mai)  reached gradually by the year 2000.
51 The lnvestment is assumed to be 3OX lover during the flrst three yers and added to the
last three years, etendlng the construction by two extra years. It is then assumed that
the inltial benefits are postponed two years and rech only 705 of the forecasted
values until 1995.

result of the two Rehabilitation Projects (MWSRP I
1.   Under the leadership of President Corazon C.   and MWStP 11) and from the Angat Water Supply
Aquio, the MWSS Management with the support of   Optimition Project, MWSS expects to provide house
the Board of Trustees has been caying out plans and   connecdons to most of the houses requesting water
programs to increase the supply of water, improve the   connections within the distibution system, and would
provision of water and sewerage services and uplift   extend the water pipelines to new areas as weLL
e living conditions of the 8.3 million popiuation
within its service area. A major part of this pregram    4.  This will considerably expand the population
is the completion by 1994 of the Angat Water Supply   served, and share the benefits of water supply among
Optimization Project (AWSOP).  This proect will  inreasg number of people within the MWSS sernice
provide an additonal supply of about 15 cuLm. of   area. The percentag of population benefitting from
water per second, or 1.3 million cum. of water per   about 360,000 new house service connections is
day and wfll serve about 3.0 million people more by   expected to increase to 65% by 1990, 70% by 1992

This high price reduces the price to be paid by low
income users, but encourages commercial and
industrial uses to continue depleting and damaging
the aquifer instead of using MWs water. This
improvement would only be possible when NRW is

of water and incrasing its aviability), particularly
when the water supplied by the project is available in

water to be supplied for non-domestic consms.
MWSS is aware of the need for these improvements
and its Corporate Planning Department is analyzing
