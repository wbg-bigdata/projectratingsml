Angat Water Supply Optimization Project (Loan 31 24-PH)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Angat Water Supply Optimization
Project in the Philippines, for which loan No.3124-PH in the amount of US$ 40 million equivalent was
approved on November 9, 1989 and made effective on January 23, 1990.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1995. Final transaction took place on May 8, 1996 at which
time a balance of US$2.42 million equivalent was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country Department I, East Asia
and Pacific Region and reviewed by Mr. Shivakumar, Chief of the Division. The borrower provided
comments that are included as Appendix A to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's completion mission, in March 1996. It is based
on material in the project file and obtained during the field visit. The borrower contributed to preparation
of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution and initial preparation, commenting
on the draft ICR.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ANGAT WATER SUPPLY OPTIMIZATION PROJECT (Loan 3124-PH)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.           The Angat Water Supply Optimization Project (AWSOP) was designed to support the
Government's sectoral program through the provision of financial resources and by gradually solving
sector issues including the accelerated development of institutions responsible for providing water supply
and sewerage services to the community. Through the project preparation the Bank drew on its familiarity
with the Philippines water supply and sewerage sector, its experience in supporting sector developments
worldwide, and its interest in addressing environmental issues.
Proiect objectives
ii.          The main objective of the project was to provide water supply in the National Capital
Region to fulfil the expected demand until the year 2000. The project was designed to: (a) increase the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System's (MWSS) water production capacity; (b) provide fifteen
cubic meters per second of potable water to serve an additional population of about three million persons;
(c) increase service coverage of the population in the MWSS service area (MSA) to 75% by 1994,
particularly in poor neighborhoods; (d) improve the efficiency of MWSS's operations; and (e) strengthen
MWSS's finances as well as its planning and management information systems.
iii.         The project was designed to maximize the benefits from existing investments, and to
provide urgently needed water to the MSA, which is half the country's industrial base. It would eliminate
water rationing and low pressure, reduce the dependence of commercial and industrial consumers on
groundwater use, and restore normal pressure decreasing the potential health risk posed by sewage
infiltration into un-pressurized mains.
iv.          The AWSOP project was financed by IBRD, the Asian Development Bank (ADB),the
Overseas Economic and Development Fund of Japan (OECF), and MWSS, with specific components
financed by each agency. The IBRD-financed works included a 6 km tunnel, two thirds of a 19 km
aqueduct, the second La Mesa by-pass, and the Bulacan province water system. The other components,
not financed by IBRD, included a power station, and treatment and distribution facilities. The IBRD-
financed works were completed in 1993, but other components financed by ADB and OECF are delayed
and are projected to be complete by December 1998. This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) only
relates to the completed IBRD components.
v.           The financial viability of MWSS, the implementing agency, depended upon the ability
to generate adequate income to meet all financial obligations on a timely basis, sustain a satisfactory level
of working capital to continue operations, and contribute a reasonable proportion to its investment
program. To this end MWSS agreed to set tariffs yielding adequate revenues to meet operation and
maintenance costs including depreciation, and to provide a rate of return of at least 8 % on its net revalued
fixed assets.



Hi
vi.          The planning was sound and the physical results show that the project was well founded
and the agreements reached to promote the achievement of the objectives were well conceived, although
optimistic.
Implementation experience and results
vii.         The project achieved its physical objectives with only a minor delay in completion of
construction. The identification phase was carried out in a very satisfactory manner. The feasibility
studies and detailed design benefitted not only from the extensive involvement of MWSS, but also from
the evaluation of issues by the infrastructure division within the Bank. The project also achieved its
primary objective of augmenting water supply capacity. The Government has since initiated the next
phase of adding supply capacity by signing a loan agreement with the ADB in 1996 for the Umiray-Angat
Transbasin Project, expected to be completed by 1999.
viii.        The appraisal estimated cost of the IBRD-financed works including interest during
construction at US$61.3 million, of which US$40.0 million equivalent was to be financed by the Bank.
The balance was financed from local borrowing, and internal cash generation. The original loan closing
date of December 31, 1995 was adhered to. The actual cost is US$46.4 million which is US$14.9 lower
than the appraisal estimate, mainly due to the cancellation of the Bulacan component.
ix.          Despite the additional supply, service coverage could only increase from 56% in 1989
to 67% in 1995 falling short of the 75% target. This was primarily attributable to the failure to improve
operational efficiency. Based on two rehabilitation projects which were under implementation during
appraisal of the project, plus the MWSS ongoing leak repair program, it was expected that NRW would
be reduced from the 1989 figure of 55.8% to 33.5% by the end of 1995. This did not happen and
the NRW at the end of 1995 was unchanged. As a result, water rationing remained a problem, and new
connections could not be installed at the pace planned.
x.           The failure to reduce NRW led to an impasse with the Government refusing to allow tariff
increases including adjustments for inflation after 1992. As a result, the financial performance of MWSS
began to deteriorate threatening project objectives. This impasse in 1992 indicated that more far reaching
institutional change was required to increase operational efficiency and sustain project benefits.
Consequently, the Bank initiated a high level sector dialogue with the Government resulting in the Water
Sector Reform Study in 1993, the Water Summit called by the President in 1994 and the Water Crisis
Act passed by the Congress in 1995 explicitly authorizing a restructuring of MWSS. During this period,
the Bank organized through the EDI two workshops in the Philippines on private sector participation in
the water sector. In addition, top Government policy makers, congressmen, MWSS management and
Board members and labor representatives participated in Bank organized conferences and study tours in
Barcelona and Buenos Aires in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The intense sector work culminated in the
Government's decision in 1995 to formally ask the World Bank Group to assist in the privatization of
MWSS. A 25 year concession is scheduled to become operative in February 1997.
xi.          All project objectives are expected to be achieved with the institutional restructuring of
MWSS based on Bank analysis of the experience of water utilities privatized elsewhere. Project benefits
are therefore expected to be high and sustainable. During project implementation, a number of secondary
institutional strengthening measures were initiated under the MWSS Development Program dated August
1989, including upgrading customer services and the corporate planning group (CORPLAN), improving
billing and collections, and training. The implementation of the computerized accounts system including



iv
upgrading billing and collections commenced in March 1996 and is due to be completed by September
1996.
xii.          Overall Bank supervision was highly satisfactory, being handled by an experienced
sanitary engineer, supported by environmental and financial specialists. The implementing agency's
project supervision was satisfactory and relations with the consultants and contractors were cordial and
productive. On balance the outcome of the IBRD-financed works can be considered satisfactory and the
results of the sector work accompanying the project very encouraging.
Surnnary of findings, future operations, and key lessons learned
xiii.         Benefits of the IBRD-financed works completed under this loan should be sustained given
the Government's commitment to improve water supply in MSA. MWSS restructuring will ensure that
the constructed facilities are monitored and the system is operated and maintained to yield maximum
operational and economic benefits.
xiv.          The main lessons to be drawn from the experience in implementing the project are as
follows:
(a)    the Bank should carefully evaluate the institution's capabilities to undertake programs that
have a direct bearing on the achievement of project objectives. The failure to reduce
leakages in the distribution system means that the majority of the additional water
supplied under the project is lost before it can reach consumers and generate revenues.
Without the planned privatization, this would have threatened project sustainability.
(b)    while the borrower may agree during negotiations to increase tariffs, the decision can be
affected by public resistance due to poor levels of service, as well as political issues
outside the agency's control. Assurances should be received that if a shortfall in revenues
results in the agency being unable to cover its operational costs and finance capital
projects, then the requirement for permanent money in the forn of Government capital
contributions, subsidies or foreign grants would be introduced.
(c)    administrative problems including the failure to reduce distribution losses, caused
MWSS's debt burden to substantially increase during the past five years. Investments in
infrastructure should have resulted in increased revenues to fund appropriate maintenance
of the new assets and cover debt servicing requirements.
(d)    as an alternative to using the rate of return covenant to measure satisfactory financial
performance of a water supply and sewerage utility where assets are mainly underground,
out of sight and difficult to value, an acceptable measure is the agency's contribution to
investment from internal resources; this covenant was adopted for the sewerage project
in Manila (Manila Second Sewerage Project) which was appraised in 1995.
(e)    Close monitoring yielded early warning of potential problems and appropriate sector
work supported by the highest level of Bank management enabled significant and timely
institutional reform to ensure sustainability of project benefits. The close relationship
between the Bank and the borrower provided the basis for wide-ranging discussions to
create an appropriately designed project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ANGAT WATER SUPPLY OPTIMIZATION PROJECT (Loan 3124-KO)
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.           The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), established in 1972, is
responsible for the development, operation and maintenance of water supply and sewerage systems in and
around Metropolitan Manila. The MWSS service area (MSA) includes Manila city, nine neighboring cities
and twenty-seven municipalities. MWSS is a semi-autonomous corporation under the Department of
Public Works and Highways.
2.            The Bank financed First Manila Water Supply Project (Loan 386-PH 1964-70) improved
water systems in four cities and 16 municipalities in Metro Manila. In 1978 the Bank provided Loan
1615-PH for the Second Manila Water Supply Project (MWSP II) included extension of bulk water mains
and the distribution system, and assisted MWSS into becoming an efficient public utility.
3.            An important part of MWSS's plan to upgrade and expand water services in MSA was
to increase its production capacity. All but 3 % of the total water supply produced by MWSS comes from
the Angat river. MWSS initially intended to undertake the Third Manila Water Supply Project (MWSP
III) at a cost estimated around US$1.000 million to include the construction of a dam on the Kaliwa river,
transmission mains and treatment facilities. Factors affecting the decision not to proceed with this project
related to national political changes, the lengthy construction period of about nine years before any water
supply would be available, and budgetary constraints.
4.           It was necessary therefore, for MWSS to look for a solution whereby additional water
capacity would be available earlier, in phased increases at a lower cost. The alternative adopted would
optimize water resources available from the existing source of the Angat river. The scheme would be in
two stages; first the more effective reallocation of water from the Angat reservoir among the beneficiaries
(water supply, power generation, irrigation) resulting in a 15 cums increase in MWSS's share for water
supply; and second, an additional 9 cums through an inter-basin transfer from the Umiray river by 2000.
5.           In February 1989 the Government requested the Bank to co-finance the Angat Water
Supply Optimization Project (AWSOP) with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF). The project was designed to address a basic need for
increased water supply, and to strengthen the institutional capacity of MWSS, a major public utility. The
objectives were to: (a) increase MWSS's water production capacity; (b) provide 15 cums of water to serve
an additional population of about 3.0 million persons; (c) increase service to 75% of the population in
MSA by 1994, particularly in poor neighborhoods; (d) improve efficiency of MWSS's operations: and
(e) strengthen MWSS's finances as well as its planning and management information systems.
Construction of the second stage project, the ADB financed Umiray-Angat Transbasin Project (UATP),
at an estimated cost of US$220 million, commenced in 1996 and is expected to be completed by 1999.
6.            A summary of the AWSOP project description (Parts A, B and C) appears in Appendix
B of this report. The Bank was requested to help finance the main portion of Part A of the project
comprising: a 6 km tunnel, two sections of a 16 km aqueduct, the 2.5 km La Mesa by-pass, and 35 km
of water mains in Bulacan province, with the remainder financed by ADB, OECF, local bonds and
MWSS internal cash generation.



2
7.           In a modification to the project, the long-term program for provision of water supply to
the Bulacan province was reviewed in the Memorandum of Understanding between MWSS, the Local
Water Utilities Administration and the Bulacan province dated January 9, 1990. Following additional
studies it was decided to eliminate the component proposed for Bank financing, and MWSS would use
its own resources to supply water to two towns in the province located on the boundary of the MSA.
8.           In July 1994, MWSS requested that a portion of the savings of the IBRD loan be used
to finance consultants' services relating to the distribution network which was recognized as being within
the original project objectives, and the Loan agreement was duly amended in January 1995 to include up
to US$350,000 for such services.
9.           The project objectives were well defined, realistic and important for the sector
development, and had the full commitment of MWSS. The complexity of the project was considered to
be within the capabilities of the management of MWSS. There were no unusual risks although delayed
implementation of the various components would postpone overall project completion, and failure to
reduce NRW would increase the cost of water and reduce the population benefitted.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
10.          The project was timely and well prepared, the scope and scale well thought out, and
accurately represented in the SAR. The project concept was clear and shared by all relevant parties, the
design being carried out by consultants in close collaboration with all involved agencies.
Physical objectives
lI.          Taking into account the reduced scope of the Bank components, it is considered to have
satisfied the physical objectives of the project. It is disappointing that the other project components are
delayed by about four years and therefore this report can only review the completed components which
received IBRD financing.
12.          The design of all project components represented the least-cost solution to expand water
supply to MSA. The analysis of the least-cost solution is in the Feasibility Study available in the Project
File. Hydrologic studies demonstrated that by modifying the operating rules and allowing use of the
Angat dam's full design capacity, MWSS could optimize the use of 15 cums of water, and construct
treatment and distribution facilities at an amount equivalent to one third of the cost of Manila Water
Supply III Project.
13.          Construction of the Bank financed components was completed by October 1993, about
nine months behind schedule. Some of the ADB and OECF financed components originally scheduled
to be completed by 1994 are currently projected to be completed by December 1998. Construction of
distribution network is delayed by about four years because of technical and legal issues regarding
procurement of pipes. The Novaliches to Balara aqueduct is delayed due to right of way negotiations, and
the telemetry system is behind schedule because of delays in bid evaluation.
14.          The actual cost of the Bank financed components including interest during construction
was US$46.4 million which is US$14.9 million lower than the appraisal estimate mainly due to the
cancellation of the Bulacan component. Full details comparing estimated and actual costs appear in Table
8 of Part II of this report. The project was financed by local bonds, MWSS internal cash generation, and
a US$38.1 million Bank loan. The loan closed on December 31, 1995.



3
15.          In September 1991, to assist the Philippines Government during the Middle East crisis,
the Bank increased the percentage of expenditures from 70% to 90% on civil works that could be
financed from the loan. This in part enabled MWSS to utilize 95% of the original loan amount even
though about 17% of the IBRD financed works was canceled.
Water demand
16.          The projections made during appraisal were based on the assumptions that the MSA
population would increase by 16% between 1989 and 1995, with a similar increase in the percentage of
the population with direct water connections. It was also assumed that per capita water consumption
would increase by about 8% and NRW would reduce from 55.8% of production to 35.5%.
17.          The estimates made during appraisal (1989) compared to the actual results appear in Table
B.1.

1995            10.7       67.2%         844.3         975.9        426.5        56.3%
18.          The population growth projection was 3% higher than forecast, but the number of
connections was 6% below appraisal estimations, mainly due to the lack of supply. MWSS did not
succeed with its stated objective of reducing NRW, which increased by 0.5% since 1989, and this major
failure to reach the target objective had a considerable adverse impact on the company's revenues.
19.          The critical problem of NRW has persisted for over 30 years. However, between 1984
and 1994, MWSS has actively pursued a series of remedial measures including two rehabilitation projects
employing 1,800 persons and costing US$120 million. Other action includes a comprehensive leak
detection program including contracting out leak repairs. There is major concentration on a series of
programs to reduce NRW to acceptable levels and the ongoing and proposed programs directly involved
in reducing NRW appear in Appendix C.
20.          The MWSS Development Program dated August 4, 1989 planned to steadily improve
revenue water, and at that time the first results of the rehabilitation projects were very promising
indicating sharp reductions of NRW in completed zones. Based on these first results, assurances were
obtained that MWSS would take all measures to reduce NRW to 35.5% by 1995. This expectation was
not met due to continued administrative weaknesses which were not remedied by frequent changes of
leadership.



4
Financial obiectives
21.           The financial objectives were established so that MWSS would improve its financial
situation, have adequate funds to properly operate and maintain the facilities, and contribute to funding
investments. To support these objectives, MWSS agreed that revenues would be set to cover operating
and maintenance costs including depreciation, and produce annual rates of return of not less than 8 %.
22.           The financial accomplishment during the project period was very disappointing, mainly
due to failure in achieving operating targets. The main reason for this poor result was that NRW was not
significantly reduced. While MWSS could potentially have made up for this revenue loss by increasing
tariffs beyond those planned, they were unable to do so as the Board could not justify passing on the cost
of poor performance to the consumer. To partly offset the lower than expected revenue income, some
operational expenditure was less than projected, which could indicate inadequate maintenance of its
facilities.
23.           Since 1989, the rate of return targets have been maintained at over 8.0%, thus meeting
a covenant of the Loan Agreement, except for 1995 when the figure dropped to 6.9%. The commitment
not to incur any long-term debt unless a debt servicing ratio of at least 1.2 was maintained was also
achieved each year except for 1995. Provisional projections show these figures at 6.02% and 1.19 for
FY1996. The reason MWSS did not achieve the rate of return target in 1995 was due to reduced income
and the increased value of fixed assets in operation.
Tariffs
24.           The tariff is a vital component of the MWSS operation as, together with the volume
billed, it determines the company's income. Each year the corporate planning group (CORPLAN)
prepares a review for the Board of the adequacy of its water and sewerage charges and makes
recommendations for increases in tariff levels to ensure the financial viability of the company. The report
includes a summary of revenue requirements to satisfy the company's charter rate of return target, debt
servicing requirements, and affordability, especially for the low-income section of the population. The
tariff is structured to promote conservation and provide a lifeline supply at an affordable price.
25.           Over the 1989 to 1992 period, tariffs for water and sewerage were increased in line with
annual inflation, but since May 1992 tariffs remained unchanged during years of relatively high inflation.
This course of action by the Board reflected central Government and customer resistance because of water
shortages directly resulting from MWSS's failure to sufficiently reduce NRW. While this decision by the
Board could well have acted as a stimulus to management to bolster their efforts to improve revenue
water, it also deprived the company of the necessary revenues to rectify the leakage and administrative
losses.
26.           While the failure to increase tariffs had an impact on revenues, the shortfall in the amount
of water billed because of over optimistic NRW reduction targets was the principal reason for the failure
to meet the required revenue levels, as can be seen in Table B.2.

*Note: Excludes CERA. A currency exchange rate (CERA) was introduced in 1984 to compensate for revaluation of the Peso
against a basket of international currencies, and tracks MWSS's foreign debt service per cubic neter of water sold . At the end of
1995 the CERA surcharge was equivalent to 15% of the average tariff.
Accounts Receivable
27.          Although some progress has been made since appraisal, MWSS has not resolved the
problem of high accounts receivable which at the end of 1995 represented 139 days' sales. Since
appraisal, MWSS has collected only about 95 % of its billings, but the annual provision for uncollectible
debts is only 2.0% and therefore the balance of accounts receivable increases every year. In the ledger
are many extremely old and uncollectible debts, the high figure being partly due to its inability to write
off these balances. An examination of Table B.3 would indicate that the provision for doubtful debts is
significantly understated.
28.          In 1989 about 30% of accounts receivable was due from government agencies, and
assurances were received that the Government would take the necessary measures to reduce these debts
so that in aggregate they would not exceed four months of billing. At the end of 1995 government debts
were less than 10% of total accounts receivable and represented 3.9 months of billing.
29.          The ageing of accounts receivable including government accounts as estimated by the
accounting department at the end of 1995, is shown in Table B.3.

is in Table 6(a) and 6(b) of Part II of this report.

Institutional development
31.          While secondary institutional improvements took place during project implementation,
they were unable to compensate for the inability of management to control NRW which threatened the
full realization of project benefits. The failure to reduce NRW led to an impasse with the Government
refusing to allow tariff increases including adjustments for inflation after 1992. As a result, the financial
performance of MWSS began to deteriorate. This impasse in 1992 indicated that more far reaching
institutional change was required to increase operational efficiency and sustain project benefits.
32.          Taking this impasse as an early warning signal, the Bank initiated a high level sector
dialogue with the Government with the active involvement of top Bank management. This resulted in the
Water Sector Reform Study in 1993, the Water Summit called by the President in 1994 and the Water
Crisis Act passed by the Congress in 1995 explicitly authorizing a restructuring of MWSS. During this
period, the Bank organized through the EDI two workshops in the Philippines on private sector
participation in the water sector. In addition, top Government policy makers, congressmen, MWSS
management and Board members and labor representatives participated in Bank organized conferences
and study tours in Barcelona and Buenos Aires in 1995 and 1996, respectively. The intense sector work
culminated in the Government's decision in 1995 to formally ask the World Bank Group to assist in the
privatization of MWSS. A 25 year concession is scheduled to become operative in February 1997.
33.          All project objectives are expected to be achieved with the institutional restructuring of
MWSS based on Bank analysis of the experience of water utilities privatized elsewhere. Project benefits
are therefore expected to be high and sustainable.
34.          During project implementation, the performance of customer services has developed
satisfactorily with more timely response times for new house connections, meter repairs and replacement.
The monthly management report format has been improved to include details of leak repairs, illegal
connections, new customer services, and volume billed per sector. Large commercial and industrial
consumers are monitored by each sector and action is taken where consumption varies from the three
month average. Connections closed for non-payment are checked each month, to ensure they have not
been illegally re-connected.
35.          The 'Rover' meter reading equipment has been upgraded to improve security of data, and
new machines are on order with greater capacity than the existing equipment, which will interface with
the new computerized billing and collection system later in 1996.
36.          The central control room to operate the telemetry component was held up due to delays
in the bid evaluation. The telemetry system is expected to be fully operational by June 1997 with the
latest technology to keep management constantly informed on water levels in the dams and reservoirs,
the level of water flowing in the distribution system measured through 56 flow meters, and the pressure
levels in each sector, which is very important in monitoring and improving the level of NRW.
37.          The computerized billing and collection system has not operated satisfactorily for well
over 15 years, even though a new computer for this purpose was installed in 1989. The main system
problem was the delay of around six months in posting cash receipts to individual customer accounts,
which meant that monthly bills did not show unpaid arrears from previous months, thus impeding debt
collection performance. In 1990 the MIS group commenced plans to fully computerize the whole of the
accounting function and at the same time introduce a more efficient system of recording collections. The
first trials of the new computerized billing and collections system started in March 1996, and
implementation of the total system is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 1996.

38.          CORPLAN has upgraded its computerized models for its management information system,
investment planning, financial projections, and water demand. The projections including operating and
financial parameters are periodically produced and provided to the lending agencies. However, although
these comprehensive reports are regularly updated and contain important information on developments
within MWSS, the senior officers seldom use them and therefore the benefits to aid management are
mainly wasted.
Environmental objectives
39.          An expected environmental benefit from the additional water supply would be the
reduction in the high level of groundwater used in MSA, preventing excessive depletion and salinity
intrusions. Later studies demonstrated that the current rate of ground water extraction did not cause any
serious damage to the aquifer, and salinity intrusion was not a significant problem. Another projected
benefit would be that the increased supply would give continuous pressure through the entire network.
However, due to the delay in completion of the project components, as well as the ongoing serious
leakage problem, the supply is still not sufficient to satisfy demand in all areas of MSA, and the pressure
in the network is not constant.
40.          The impact of additional wastewater, which will be experienced in MSA once the
additional supply is available, will be alleviated mainly by septic tanks which are required by law for all
houses. In 1990, MWSS planned two sewerage projects to be implemented in sequence, but they were
not followed through because of high per capita costs. The Bank-financed Manila Second Sewerage
Project due to commence later in 1996 is a low cost sanitation project developed as a result of the earlier
rejected projects. The new water and sewerage master plan due to be completed by mid-1996 reviews in
detail the proposals for collection and disposal of wastewater for the next 20 years.
Economic rate of return
41.          The projected economic rate of return (ERR) of 15 % made during appraisal was prepared
for the total project including those components financed by ADB and OECF. Given the costs associated
with the project and the returns that have been accruing to MWSS to date, it is anticipated the actual ERR
will be close to the original forecast detailed in the staff appraisal report. However, as other components
of the project are currently ongoing, a more accurate ERR is expected to be completed by December 31,
1998.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
42.          At appraisal, the project was already in an advanced stage of implementation with the
contracts for the tunnel and the aqueduct having already been awarded, and completion of all components
planned by December 1994. MWSS's engineering area was responsible for project planning and design,
and the construction was the responsibility of the Project Management Office (PMO) established under
the MWSS deputy administrator for construction. The performance of the consultants who assisted in the
engineering and construction areas was satisfactory.
43.          The standard of performance of the contractors constructing the tunnel, aqueducts and
related tasks was generally satisfactory, although some of the equipment provided to satisfy the minimum
requirement condition of the contract was in a poor state of repair. The construction equipment was
upgraded after an initial slow start.



8
44.           Delays in completion of the IBRD financed works were not excessive, amounting to about
nine months in total. The delays were due to shortages of construction materials (mainly cement),
unworkable site conditions due to unusually heavy rainfall, lack of ventilation equipment and minor
collapses in the tunnels, unexpected rock conditions in tunnels causing the issue of numerous variation
orders, seepage in the La Mesa by-pass, and redesign of the buried conduit to avoid felling some trees.
45.           The commitment of MWSS management and staff was generally satisfactory and their
internal administrative procedures worked satisfactorily. The submission of project progress reports and
managerial and financial monitoring indicators was regular and good.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
46.           The operational requirements of the tunnel, aqueduct and by-pass are minimal as it is a
gravity system for the total length of the construction. However, maintenance of the sluice gates at Ipo
dam will be required, regular inspection to check for leakage in the aqueducts and by-pass, and regular
monitoring of the flow meter at Bicti junction.
47.           The principal risk to the achievement and enhancement of the project's potential benefits
would be failure to properly maintain the system. The financial resources needed for adequate operation
and maintenance will be insufficient if there is not significant progress on the serious NRW problem, and
if tariffs are not set at levels allowing MWSS to operate as a self-financing public utility. These risks
would now be mitigated by the privatization of MWSS.
48.           The institutional and operational improvements introduced or under implementation since
appraisal including computerization of accounts, improved billing and collection, new sectors to control
hydraulic flows, improved customer services and planning, increased training, telemetry, and several
NRW reduction programs, are collectively expected to lead to progressive and permanent improvements
in efficiency and performance. These would be reinforced by the expertise brought in by a specialized
international water operator.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
49.           The Bank worked closely with MWSS during the preparation, appraisal, negotiation and
loan approval stages of the project. The technical alternatives selected were appropriate and represented
the least-cost solution to improve water systems in MSA. There were no unusual risks, although at
appraisal it was recognized that a failure to reduce NRW would have an adverse affect on internal cash
generation.
50.           Continuity of Bank staff during implementation was highly satisfactory with very few
changes between the appraisal and the supervision teams. Ten supervision missions were carried out at
regular intervals over the implementation period, and there was good cooperation between the Bank and
MWSS management and staff.
51.           Financial and operational projections were prepared at appraisal along with key
monitoring indicators, and the main performance targets were covenanted. During supervision missions
these parameters were regularly checked and any deviations were recorded in the mission's Aide Memoire
which were reported to the implementing agency by Bank headquarters. Close monitoring yielded early
warning signals which led to successful sector work resulting in institutional changes designed to sustain



9
project benefits.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
52.          MWSS's performnance through to completion of the IBRD financed components was
satisfactory. The detailed engineering preparation was good, although a more comprehensive test of rock
conditions where tunneling was to take place would have prepared the contractors in advance for correct
construction methods. Supervision of construction got off to a slow start mainly due to under-manning
of the supervision teams, but this was later rectified and the overall performance was good.
53.          The status of performance on the major covenants in the loan and project agreements is
shown in Table 10 of part II of this report. Compliance with these covenants is mixed with disappointing
results on the decrease of NRW, reduction of accounts receivable and, in the last year of project
implementation, the failure to achieve rate of return and debt service targets.
54.          The failure to meet these perfonnance targets (NRW, accounts receivable, rate of return,
debt service) means that MWSS's income is too low. When this happens, the tendency is to reduce
expenditure on operations and maintenance, resulting in performance inefficiencies and the deterioration
of assets, which appears to be the case in MWSS. This lack of finances to efficiently operate the system
exacerbates the difficulties within MWSS, and the cycle of new investments to rehabilitate existing assets
is a permanent negative feature. Hence the Balara Treatment Plant Rehabilitation Project currently being
implemented, the planned rehabilitation of the La Mesa I Treatment Plant which was constructed 12 years
ago, and the total network (including the areas rehabilitated between 1984 and 1994) are currently being
studied for major renovation projects (Appendix C).
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
55.          The project results on the IBRD financed works are rated satisfactory, tempered by the
disappointing operational and financial performance. Physical project objectives were achieved with very
little delay and there is evident sustainability of the completed facilities. While the Bulacan component
representing about 17% of the IBRD financed works was dropped, MWSS was able to take advantage
of the amendment in the Loan Agreement which increases the percentages of expenditures to be financed
for civil works from 70% to 90% (para 15). However, the full survey of achievements will not take
place until the total project is complete and the ADB completion report is prepared, presently expected
to be ready by mid- 1999.
56.          The institutional developments that took place during the implementation of the project
should have a lasting impact on efficient operation and maintenance of new assets. The restructuring of
MWSS assisted by the Bank's sector work would be instrumental in sustaining project benefits.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
57.          The completed project works are expected to be operated and maintained by the private
concessionaire. With the induction of an experienced international water operator it is expected that all
facilities would be utilized efficiently. MWSS is also experienced in operating systems constructed under
the project, and the consultants provided additional training to operators on the new technologies
introduced during the project.



10
58.           Performance monitoring is already well established within MWSS partly as a result of
the improvements introduced in the 1989 MWSS Development Plan. The existing allocation of duties and
responsibilities is currently being reviewed under the MWSS Operational Strengthening Study (MOSS)
the final report of which will be ready by mid-1996.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
59.           The current state of the distribution system fundamentally calls into question the benefit
which will accrue to customers as additional water resources from AWSOP become available. At that
stage average pressures in the system will rise, but the current condition of the distribution system will
certainly lead to increased losses, and very little increase in revenue (para 20). A prior focus on
improving the distribution network is essential.
60.           The calculation of the rate of return for MWSS relies on a realistic valuation of the fixed
assets. Due to the inherent difficulty in valuing assets (mainly underground and out of sight), compounded
by the uncertainty of asset replacement values, it is considered advisable in future to focus on the main
concern which is the overall target for internally generated funds. The covenant's objectives promote
financial viability, satisfactory financial performance, prudent financial management of the project entity,
and support socio-economic goals. The cash generation covenant was used in several follow-up projects -
e.g. Manila Second Sewerage Project 1996 (para 23)_
61.           The agreed project Financing Plan required reductions in NRW combined with increases
in water and sewerage tariffs, so that revenues would be at an adequate level to produce a minimum rate
of return. While it may be appropriate to base the project implementation on assurances received during
negotiations, in retrospect consideration should have been given to the possibility that service levels might
not significantly improve, and also that political realism could change priorities or deflect attention from
the program - e.g. national pressures restricting the Board's ability to make tariff increases (para 25).
62.           During the drilling of tunnel No.3 and the tunnel sections of the aqueducts, different
structures of rock were found than had been expected, which resulted in a large number of variation
orders being issued. During project design test drilling should have been carried out to thoroughly
investigate rock conditions (para 44).
63.           A major factor in the relative success of this project was the active participation by senior
management in its preparation and implementation, and the close relationship with the Bank which helped
to create an appropriately designed project. With proper preparation, and regular meetings with top
management and contractors, it has been shown that a project can be constructed in a relatively short
period of time (para 49).
64.           MWSS has accumulated a substantial amount of debt which would not be a burden if
funds invested had a positive impact on the company's revenues. In retrospect, measures should have
been taken to ensure that the current situation in which new resources increase debt but do not produce
new revenue does not arise. Recent investments have produced only marginal growth resulting in debt
service difficulties (para 54).
65.           A project of the magnitude of AWSOP benefits from inter-active dialogue and cooperation
with the Bank, as it provides a mechanism to follow the difficult path towards institutional reform, and
strengthen the organization to carry forward the development programs efficiently (para 32).

Table 9: Economic Rate of Return
The economic rate of return (ERR) made during appraisal for the total
project was 15%. The Bank financed components were completed by the end of 1993,
but other components financed by ADB and OECF are still ongoing and are currently
projected to be completed by December 31, 1998.
Given the costs associated with the project and the returns that have
been accruing to MWSS so far, it is anticipated the original ERR as detailed in
the staff appraisal report will likely be achieved. However, as other components
of the project are currently ongoing, it is expected that a more accurate
accounting of the ERR would be better performed by June 30, 1999.

CC'IPLETIONi REPORT
FOR
CONTRACT NO. T-3
I.   PROJECT BACKGROUND
The Angat Water Supply Optimization Project of which Contract T-3
under AWSOP I forms one of the integral parts was envisaged to meet the
domestic water needs of Metro Manila and environs before the entry of
tne Manila Water Supply Project III (MWSP III) into the.mainstream of
the MWSS Central Distribution System. The project will deliver about 15
cubic meters per second of water which is sufficient for the domestic
water requirements of some 3 million people.
AWSOP I starts from the Angat Reservoir where water will pass-thru
the NAPOCOR existing Power Intake and Penstock of the Angat Hydro-
electric Plant.  Water will then be conducted thru a separate penstock,
into Auxiliary Plant No. 5 where power will be generated after which
this will flow to the Ipo Reservoir, thence thru the new Ipo Intake into
the Ipo-Bicti Tunnel. As water goes out from the Bicti Outlet Stilling
Basin it then proceeds down to the La Mesa dam thru Aqueduct No. 5 and
finally to Metro Manila. (Please refer to Project Layout marked Attach-
ment A).
The three (3) cortract packages comprising AWSOP I are:  (a) Angat
Auxiliary Plant No. 5 (Contract AN-5)  involving the supply, installa-
tion,  and commissioning  of electro-mechanical  equipment and "appurte-
nances; (b) Civil Works for Angat Auxiliary Plant No. 5 (Contract



25
AN-5A);  and (c) Contract  T-3 (Ipo-Bicti Tunnel  %o. 3, Ipo Intake and
Bicti Outlet Works).   ThE detailed description of each package  is as
follows:
l    Contract AN-5
This contract package is composed of the supply, manufacture,
installation and commiissioning of hydropower turbine and
generator with installed capacity of 18 Megawatts. Other data
for the turbine are: rated head = 92 meters; and rated speed
= 400 RPM. The rated output for the generator is 20,000 KVA
with rated Power Factor of 90%.  This hydropower plant which
will be the fifth at the Angat Multi-purpose Dam, will cost a
total of P152.49 M and is under the Contract of Harbin Power
Plant Equipment Import and Export Corporation of China.
2.   Contract AN-5A
As an adjunct to Contract AN-5, this package which costs about
P58.8 M will provide the foundation and superstructure of the
power station to house the Turbo-generator and Ancillary
Equipment of the Auxiliary Plant No. 5. It will also include
the intricate tapping of the T-Bifurcator to the main penstock
which is a procedure considered specialized construction-wise.



26
3.   Con,tract T-3
This package  is composed of the  Ipo-Bicti  horse-shoe  shaped
tunnel,  an  Intake  at  Ipo  and  an Outlet  Stilling  Basin  at
Bicti.   The Ipo-Bicti  tunnel  at 6.16 kilometers  long is the
component that is in the critical  path.  With a diameter of
4.3 meters, the tunnel was designed to pass 22 cubic meters
per second including that from the Umiray River.
AWSOP in its entirety was originally estimated to cost P6.7 bill-
ion, of which, 30 percent is government equity; P2.3 billion local
borrowings, and the balance, foreign loans. By 1991, however, the total
cost of the project at 1990 prices was estimated at P8.4 B.
MWSS decided to avail of more local funds for AWSOP to avoid too
much foreign exchange risk exposure and for economic reasonsi
AWSOP  easily  attracted  willing  financiers  as  the  Philippine
National Bank (PNB) and the Union Bank of the Philippines(UBP) who
offered a package loan for the entire P2.3 billion.  The Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB) first offered $100 million, then increased this-to
$140 million; and the World Bank likewise offered $40 million as their
share of the project.
The ADB and WB (IBRD) loan offer was the subject of a Memorandum of
Understanding between the MWSS and ADB, and an Aide Memoire between the
MWSS and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development



27
(IBRD) after termination of the joint appraisal  conducted by the ADB
from April 11 to May 12, 1989.
When  the  AllSOP was  presented  to  the  Cepartmernt of  Budget  and
Management, their full support was thrown behind the project. The first
annual  allocation  of  P291.12  million  was  included  in  the  CY  1989
National Budget which was subsequently approved by Congress.
One of the conditions of the loan package offered by the PNB and
UBP however, was the full and unconditional guarantee of the Republic of
the Philippines.   The National  Government does not normally guarantee
long term local borrowings, hence, MWSS resorted to local bond flota-
tion.
MWSS requested authority from the President of the Philippines
through the Secretary of Finance, the Government Corporate. Monitoring
and Coordination Committee (GCMCC) and the Monetary Board to float bonds
amounting to P2.3 billion.
On May 4, 1989, the President approved the now considered biggest
single bond flotation in the history of the Philippines.
Based on this approval, the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) by and
between the MWSS and PNB and UBP specifying the bank's commitment to buy
bonds was signed on May 17, 1989.



28
The first series of the M,WSS Angat Bonds flotation was issued in
July 1989.
Loan negotiations with IBRD were conducted in July 1989 and in
August 1989 with ADB.

Angat Water Supply Optimization Project (Loan 3124-PH)
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project, part of an overall investment program for which the Government
and MWSS secured finance from different sources. The project comprises of:
Part A:     Transmission and Bulk Water Supply.   (Bank Financed)
construction of (i) tunnel No. 3 (about 6 km, 4.6 m diameter); (ii)
aqueduct No. 5 in three sections, 5A, 5B and 5C (about 16 km, 3.6 m
diameter);  (iii) the second La Mesa by-pass (about 2.5 km, 3.6 m
diameter); and (iv) water mains (about 35 km) to provide treated
water (1.1 cums) in bulk to eight municipalities in Bulacan
Province.
Part B:     Water Source, Treatment and Distribution Facilities.   (ADB - OECF
Financed)
construction of: (i) modification of the Angat power station; (ii)
the La Mesa II treatment plant (10.4 cums); (iii) a water reservoir
(260,000 m3); (iv) expansion of the primary and secondary
distribution system by about 420 km; (v) expansion of the tertiary
distribution system by about 100 km including provision of about
345,000 service connections; and (vi) telemetering.
Part C:      Consultants' Services.    (ADB Financed)
Provision of engineering consultancy services for the project.
PROJECT SUMMARY
The Angat auxiliary power station to be expanded by an additional
turbo-generator and construction of an extension of the powerhouse and
modification of the penstock of the main turbines to allow release of 15 cums of
water to the Ipo reservoir. Tunnel No.3, followed by aqueduct No.5, to transfer
raw water from Ipo dam to La Mesa and Balara treatment plants and allow for
elimination of the Novaliches reservoir from the system during dry periods.
The 15 cums of raw water to be directed partly to La Mesa I treatment
plant (4.6 cums) and partly to the new La Mesa II plant (10.4 cums). A new
reservoir of 260,000 m3 to be constructed at Bagbag and connected with the La
Mesa plants by a treated water aqueduct (0.5 km, 3.6 m diameter). The
distribution system to be expanded by about 120 km of primary lines and 300 km
of secondary lines including three new pumping stations and rehabilitation of
two; and 100 km of tertiary lines, including about 345,000 service connections.
The metering of flows in the entire distribution system to be improved and
monitored centrally through a telemetering system, and also automatic water
analyses and monitoring of key water quality parameters.



48
Bulk water to be supplied to Bulacan province (about 90 MLD) to solve
critical water shortages in eight municipalities bordering MSA, and to provide
in return for water taken by MWSS from the Angat river located in the province.
CO-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
The Bank financed Part A of the project, except for section 5A of the
aqueduct which was financed locally. Parts B and C to be co-financed by ADB
except for items B (iii) and (iv), including respective consultancy services for
Part C, which would be financed by OECF.

NON-REVENUE WATER
1.          MWSS continues to have persistent problems of high distribution
losses which on an annual average basis have resulted in NRW figures of at least
55% for the past decade. On a monthly basis in 1995, the NRW figure has
fluctuated between 49.8% and 62.7%, averaging out the year at 56.3%. The lower
levels were during the summer periods when supplies were constrained, and the
high figures were in the latter part of the year when pressure was increased.
2.           Between May and December 1995, water production increased by 19.42
million m3 per month, but revenue water only increased by 0.73 million m3 per
month, clearly indicating a massive leakage problem in the distribution system,
giving rise to increased losses as average pressure rises. The failure of revenue
water to increase in direct proportion to the production increase may also
indicate a billing problem.
3.          A coordinated and integrated program for the long-term sustainable
reduction of NRW to acceptable levels throughout MSA is urgently required.
4.           Programs currently being executed or under consideration by MWSS:
A. MWSS Funded   Under the direct control of the Senior Deputy Administrator for
Operations and Customer Services, MWSS are undertaking several ongoing programs
based at sector levels to reduce leakages, improve metering, and reduce NRW.
