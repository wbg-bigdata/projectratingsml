made as follows
:
(a)
For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or

justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request;
or
(B)
deposit into the Special Account
(or, if the Bank
shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to
the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
Page  21
