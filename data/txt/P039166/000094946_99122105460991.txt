IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF UKRAINE
DANUBE DELTA BIODIVERSITY PROJECT
GET GRANT 28654
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Ukraine Danube Delta Biodiversity Project,
for which the GET Grant 28654 in the amount of SDR 1.1 million (US$1.6 million equivalent) was
approved on June 21, 1994 and made effective on August 4, 1994.
The Grant was closed on June 30, 1999, following a six-month extension to the original closing date of
December 31, 1998. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement/recovery took place on June 4, 1999.
The ICR was prepared by Phillip Brylski and Alexei Slenzak (ECS SD) and reviewed by Gottfried
Ablasser, ECSSD Portfolio Manager. The Recipient's comments on the ICR and contribution to the ICR
are included as appendices B and C, respectively.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's completion mission from April 12-17, 1999. It is based
on material in the project files and discussions with the staff of the Ministry for Environmental Protection
and Nuclear Safety (MEPNS) engaged in the project, the Project Inplementation Unit (PIU), NGOs, and
other individuals and organisations involved in the project.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF UKRAINE
DANUBE DELTA BIODIVERSITY PROJECT
GET GRANT 28654
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.    The Danube Delta is the second largest delta in Europe, covering about 564,000 hectares, with
122,000 hectares in Ukraine and the rest in Romania. Over the last century, the wetlands have been
degraded by the construction of dikes and large scale hydrological works but maintain significant
social, economic, and biodiversity values. The original Danube Delta GEF project planned assistance
only to the Romanian part of the delta because Ukraine was not yet a member of the Bank. During the
project's identification, the scope of the project was amended to provide parallel support to the Danube
Plavny Reserve Authority (DPA) in Ukraine, particularly to raise the level of national and international
interest in the protection and management of the Ukrainian part of the delta.
Project Objectives and Components
ii.    Objectives: The project objective was to protect and enhance the Ukrainian part of the Danube
Delta ecosystem and contribute to biodiversity conservation within the delta. The project objective and
investments emphasized improvements in management of the protected area at the local level and the
capacity building needed to implement the project and continue the activities in the operational phase.
Tlhe project's focus on creation of the biosphere reserve and skills and methods for its improved
management was appropriate. The Completion Mission team and the Recipient agreed that the project
was well-designed and its activities and expenditures were appropriate for achieving the objectives.
iii.   Components: The project investments were delivered through eight components designed to
strengthen the Danube Plavny Authority and the warden service, improve monitoring and database
management, initiate the restoration of key wetlands, improve public awareness, establish the Danube
biosphere reserve, facilitate the reserve's participation in regional initiatives, and establish mechanisms
to assist with financing of the reserve's recurrent costs in the operational phase.
Implementation Experience and Results
iv.   Achievement of Objectives: The project was implemented as planned and achieved its
objectives satisfactorily. The Ukraine Danube Biosphere Reserve was established, and improved
techniques and participatory methods for the protection and management of its biodiversity were
implemented. A more proactive approach to protected areas management in Ukraine was established,
and the capacity of the Reserve Authority to implement the management plan in collaboration with
local users was strengthened. The project fostered cooperation with Romania, especially on technical
exchanges. At the end of the project, a Romania-Ukraine transboundary biosphere reserve was



ii
established. The project also led to collaboration and partnerships on delta conservation/natural
resource management issues with organizations in central and western Europe.
v.    Major Factors Affecting the Project: Two factors affected the project positively. The first was
the Recipient's prior experience with Bank projects, gained through implementation of the GEF-
financed Transcarpathian Biodiversity Protection Project and a National Biodiversity Strategy and
Action Plan. The second was the strong interest by intemational organizations such as the Dutch
General Directorate for Public Works and Water Management (RIZA) and World Wildlife Fund-
International in forming partnerships with Ukraine stakeholders to implement the project. Two factors
slowed project implementation. The first was the difficulties encountered in constructing the
headquarters building, mainly attributable to a lack of private sector experience in construction and
government regulations. The second was the new regulations on the use of foreign bank accounts by
both private and public sector organizations, which resulted in temporary freezing of the Special
Accounts for most Bank projects in the final year of implementation. Finally, the project was
implemented in a period of severe national budgetary problems, which reduced staff morale. Although
these budgetary problems promoted a cautious, risk averse approach to management decisions with
fiscal impacts, they also produced a proactive approach to developing income generating activities such
as tourism.
Project Sustainability and Future Operations
vi.   Sustainability: The main stakeholders' commitment to continue the project activities is strong
and key benefits of the project will continue to be achieved in the operational phase with the assistance
of government financial support. Although the GoU's budgetary support for the Danube Biosphere
Reserve was leveraged by the GEF project and is expected to continue through the operational phase,
the cost of implementing the operational plan will require additional external support. The main reason
for this is Ukraine's difficult economic conditions and their impact on state budgets for all protected
areas. There are indications that grant support will be made available by other donors, but this is not
certain. Therefore, while key aspects of the project are sustainable, there remains some uncertainty over
whether the project as a whole is sustainable. To help meet the challenge of financial sustainability, the
biosphere reserve gained approval for the right to operate a revenue account, fed by revenues from
fines, resource use fees, fee-paying visitors, and donations, and has had success in applying for small
grants. Each of these activities has been designed to generate a modest supplement to the budget that
will contribute to project sustainability.
vii.   Future Operations: The Recipient prepared a costed workplan for priority activities to be
implemented in the operational period from 1999 to 2002 that focuses on reserve infrastructure and
resource management, wetlands restoration, research and monitoring, public education, regional and
international cooperation, and tourism development. An estimated US$150,000 will be required
annually to finance the plan over the next 3.5 years. Excluding salaries, the reserve can expect to cover
approximately one-third of the investments needed from the Academy of Sciences. The reserve will
attempt to finance the remaining two-from income generating activities and external sources.
Bank and Borrower Performance
viii.  Bank Performance: The Bank's performance was satisfactory throughout preparation and
implementation. The project was well prepared: the project design was fully appropriate to the project



iii
objectives, and the Recipient was comfortable with the level of detail on project activities, budget, and
implementation arrangements found in the project document. Early in implementation, the Bank
provided assistance with procurement, focused on human resources development activities that were
useful in implementing the project and preparing the Recipient for the operational phase, and assisted
with facilitating partnerships with international organizations interested in the project. The Bank was
responsive to the additional supervision needs not foreseen during preparation, by accessing trust funds
for technical issues and training. The project was continuously supervised from project launch through
completion by a technical specialist experienced with the needs of the project and with Ukraine.
ix.    Recipient Perfornance: The Recipient's performance was satisfactory. The grant was
disbursed over a five year period and its completion required one six-month extension. The legal
covenants were continuously enforced. The project was implemented largely as planned, with small
adaptive changes made in consultation with the Bank. The principal beneficiary of the project was the
Danube Plavny Authority (re-named the Danube Biosphere Reserve Authority at the end of the
project), which consisted of a relatively small staff with nearly no experience with bilateral or
multilateral financed projects. The reserve staff performed well in adapting its previous mandate of
monitoring and protection functions typical of a strictly protected area to include wetland management
and public education and involvement. The DPA was assisted by the MEPNS and its Central Board of
National Nature Park and Reserve Affairs, the Academy of Sciences, and the PIU. The Academy of
Sciences contributed modest budgetary resources, substantial technical support for the scientific
program, and oversight with regard to the Man and the Biosphere Program. The performance of the
MEPNS, the executing agency, was satisfactory in facilitating all aspects of the project. The PIU's
efforts and results in procurement and as facilitators of project implementation were satisfactory,
particularly in the face of the country's extensive regulations and procedures.
Key Lessons Learned
X.    The key lessons leamed from the Recipient's and Bank's perspectives are:
a.    Well-planned public education and awareness activities are needed early in the project
to get the public involved in a meaningful way. One way to catalyse the education and
awareness activities would have been to initiate the project with an awareness and
education activities through the NGO development and small grants program.
b.    The creation of a biosphere reserve should be undertaken in phases to allow the
administration and local communities opportunity to understand and adequately plan
for its added financial and managerial responsibilities.
c.    Future projects should seek ways to simplify Ukrainian requirements and procedures
early in project implementation, in order to avoid delays in its progress.
d.    If the protected areas administration is to work effectively with local communities,
technical studies to guide sustainable use of reserve resources (e.g., hunting and
fishing) should be undertaken early in project implementation, in collaboration with
local users and linked to public education activities.



iv
e.     Confinuity in supervision responsibility contributes greatly the relationship between the
Bank and its client.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF UKRAINE
DANUBE DELTA BIODIVERSITY PROJECT
GET GRANT 28654
Part I. Project Implementation Assessment
A. Introduction
1.    The Danube Delta, one of Europe's last and largest natural wetlands, covers 564,000 hectares
(ha), 122,000 within Ukraine and 442,000 in Romania. The reed beds, riparian forests, dunes and the
open waters of the maze of tributaries of the Danube River provide critical wintering and feeding
habitat for many threatened species such as the pygmy cormorant, red-breasted goose, and several
species of threatened sturgeon.. The delta ecosystem also plays a role in environmental management of
a major international water by acting as a biological filtering system for water flowing from the Danube
river system into the Black Sea.
2.    The delta ecosystem has been a source of natural resources and income to human populations
for over 500 years. Over the last 50 years, fish harvests have significantly declined. The causes of
these declines are thought to be habitat loss and degradation as a result of large scale hydrological
works (dams, dikes, etc.), changes in Black Sea ecology as a result of its eutrophication, and
inappropriate resource management practices.
3 .    The original Danube Delta GEF project planned assistance only to the Romanian part of the
delta because Ukraine was not yet a member of the Bank. During the project's identification, the scope
of the project was amended to provide parallel support to the Danube Plavny Reserve Authority (DPA)
in Ukraine, particularly to raise the level of national and international interest in the protection and
management of the Ukrainian part of the delta
B. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
4.    The project objective was to protect and enhance the Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta
ecosystem and contribute to biodiversity conservation within the delta. During the completion mission,
the Recipient and the Bank agreed that this project objective was appropriate. The Recipient noted that
a more specific objective used during implementation was to establish the Ukraine Danube Biosphere
Reserve and initiate management measures for the protection and sustainable use of the delta
ecosystem.
5.    The project investments were delivered through the following components:
i.    Danube PlavnyAuthority Strengthening This component focused on improving the
capacity of the DPA to implement the project and manage the biosphere reserve
through staff increases, human resources development, infrastructure and equipment.



2
ii.    Warden Strengthening. This component called for strengthening the warden service
through increased staffing, training, and provision of infrastructure and equipment.
iii.   Monitoring and Database Management. This included development of monitoring
and applied research activities, and data management and a GIS.
iv.    Wetland Restoration. The project was to finance three small pilot wetland restoration
activities and small feasibility studies for the restoration of two sites with histories of
intensive economic and recreational use.
v.    Public Awareness. This component included activities for raising awareness of the
importance of the Delta ecosystem in local communities, and encouraging international
cooperation on Danube Delta and Black Sea conservation issues.
vi.    Biosphere Reserve Establishment. Under this component, the Danube Biosphere
Reserve would be established, focusing in the first phase on protecting three priority
areas (Kiliya Delta, Stensovsko-Zhebrianski plavny, SZP, and Yermakov Island).
vii.   Regional Initiatives and Coordination. This component would facilitate participation
of the DPA in training workshops related to development of the Black Sea Biodiversity
Strategy, cooperation with the Romanian GEF Danube Delta Project, and other
international initiatives.
viii.  Endowment Fund. This component would finance technical assistance for establishing
a Trust Fund for financing recurrent costs of the biosphere reserve.
C. Achievement of Objectives
6.    The project objective and investments emphasized improvements in management of the
protected area at the local level and the capacity-building needed to implement the project and continue
the activities in the operational phase. The project's focus on creation of the biosphere reserve and on
building skills and methods for its improved management was appropriate. The completion mission
team and the Recipient agreed that the project was well-designed and its activities and expenditures
were appropriate for achieving the objectives.
7.    The project's results and impacts are described below and summarized in Table 1. The project
was implemented largely as planned and achieved its objectives satisfactorily. The Ukraine Danube
Biosphere Reserve was established, and its staff was strengthened through an increase in numbers and
through training technical assistance activities which introduced international best practices in wetlands
management. The Danube Plavny Authority's approach to working with local user groups to gain
consensus on management of the Stensovsko-Zhebrianski Plavny, along with the environmental
education and NGO training/small grants program, improved support among local villagers in the
biosphere reserve's mission. The project fostered cooperation with Romania, especially on technical
exchanges. At the end of the project, a Romania-Ukraine transboundary biosphere reserve was
established. The project's modest accomplishments in the restoration of Stensovsko-Zhebrianski



3
Plavny were influenced by a delay in establishment of the biosphere reserve and by the time needed to
develop consensus among Ukrainian stakeholders on how to best manage this site.
8.    Danube Plavny Authority Strengthening. This component focused on improving the
capacity of the DPA to implement the project and manage the biosphere reserve through an increase in
staff, their professional development, and provision of infrastructure and equipment necessary to
implement the project.
9.    Under the project, the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine was expected to increase the number
of wardens and scientific staff to adequately manage the expanded reserve staff, from 18 (in 1993) to
50. The realized increase in staff occurred through the addition of wardens (now at 13) and several
higher level staff (GIS, environmental education, ecotourism development). The project design
anticipated that expansion of the protected area, zoning recommendations, and preparation of
management plans would require scientific input beyond what could be managed by the small reserve
staff in place at the time. Consequently, the project contracted specialists to assist in preparing
technical reports and the management plans. For each of the research teams engaged in these
activities, small teams were formed by the reserve staff and their consultants, so as to provide technical
assistance to the existing reserve staff and ensure continuity of the monitoring and research activities in
the operational phase.
10.   Human resources development. The project was highly successful in building capacity of
reserve staff and consultants to implement the project and to expand the results in the operational
phase.
i)    Wetlands Management Training. The project originally envisioned two wetlands
training activities: The first, facilitated by the International Wetlands Research Bureau
(JWRB; now Wetlands International), concentrated on management of water resources,
reedbeds, and wildlife in the Stensovsko-Zhebnranski Plavny and restoration
techniques. The second, several study tour/training workshops, was hosted by the
Dutch General Directorate for Public Works and Water Management (RIZA).
These activities led to a number of additional training opportunities financed by the
project and by international partners. With regard to the latter, the signing of a
Memorandum of Understanding between the Danube Plavny Authority and RIZA in
1995 initiated a series of excellent training opportunities in wetlands management and
GIS. This included collaboration among the DPA, the Ukraine Institute for the Biology
of Southern Seas (IBSS), and RIZA in preparing a hydrology model for the
Stensovsko-Zhebriasnki Plavny. The hydrology model was essential for understanding
the restoration options for SZP, now included within the biosphere reserve. The
additional technical assistance and training delivered under the project amounted to an
additional 360 person days, delivered through cofinanced and parallel activities and
programs.
ii)    GIS and conservation biology. Selected staff participated in a series of GIS training
courses between 1995 and 1999, first in collaboration with several other GEF-financed
projects and later through training financed by RIZA. RIZA's assistance, and
provision of a PC-GIS, was used by the IBSS in analyzing hydrobiological data on SZP



4
that have been useful in management planiing. DPA staff also participated in a
'biobusiness' training workshop that focused on biodiversity-based economic activities,
which was jointly held in 1995 with the staff of the Bank/GEF Belarus and Ukraine
Transcarpathian biodiversity protection projects.
iii)   Language training. As a result of English language training classes, some of the staff
are now able to communicate and collaborate with individuals and groups who do not
speak Russian or Ukrainian. This will facilitate further international collaboration, and
will be useful in assisting the reserve staff to communicate with foreign visitors to the
biosphere reserve in the operational phase.
11.   The project financed key improvements to the DPA infrastructure, the most important of which
were a headquarters building and warden stations and associated equipment. Construction of the
headquarters building met with a number of delays and problems which were eventually resolved by
purchasing a privately-built, unfinished building. The building, completed in May 1999, provides a
headquarters with sufficient office space for the staff, garage and boat dock facilities, access to the
canals for use in reaching the Kilia reedbeds of the biosphere reserve, and limited accommodations for
visitors. The original plan was for the headquarters to be built on the outskirts of Vilkovo, but its
current location within the village is more conducive to the Reserve's developing role as a socio-
cultural and public awareness center for Vilkovo.
12.   Warden Strengthening. The project provided the warden service with training, facilities, and
equipment which improved their effectiveness, elevated their professionalism, and initiated an
expanded role for them in reserve management. Early in the project, the Reserve recruited a highly
effective chief warden and the staff was increased from 4 to 13 wardens, with roughly half of these
attending warden training in the Netherlands and France (Tour du Valet). Later, the entire warden
service was hosted by the Romanian Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority for additional training
and to promote bilateral cooperation. Also, the Romanian warden team were trained in the DBR. The
training lessons were later the subject of periodic 'refresher' training activities organized by the Chief
Warden of the DPA and augmented by a training program by the MEPNS. In addition to the training,
the project financed the purchase of boats and engines (previously, many wardens used their own),
associated equipment (e.g., uniforms and binoculars), and the construction/renovation of four warden
stations. The impact of these investments was more effective protection of the Reserve's biodiversity
and an expanded role of the wardens in communicating the Reserve's function to the public. The
wardens were impressed with the Dutch motto for managing and interacting with visitors: "we should
surround ourselves with friends, not enemies". This reflects a more positive approach to visitor
management which the Ukrainian wardens are working to adopt.
13.   The project financed construction of three warden stations and the renovation of a fourth, all in
the remote Kiliya part of the DBR. The stations were constructed as originally planned: to provide
basic facilities (sanitation, sleeping, kitchen) for the wardens (while away from home on patrol) with an
extra room for fee-paying researchers and occasional tourists. Due to an increase in construction costs
beyond what was anticipated in the project budget, only one bird monitoring station (bird blind) was
constructed, with a raised trail above the Kiliya wetlands.
14.   Wetland Restoration. The original design of this component included the restoration of
canals within Vilkovo (where the DPA is located), several studies in wetland restoration, and some



5
small civil works to improve water flows through the SZP. Two adaptive changes were made during
its implementation. First, the work plan and budget for dredging canals in the village of Vilkovo was
substantially reduced. The project financed the construction of a public dock and the dredging of
canals, and most of the planned budget was reprogrammed to training activities and cost overruns for
the headquarters building. These investments, though at a lower cost than originally planned, had their
intended effect of demonstrating the DPA's interest in working for the benefit of the local community
as well as for biodiversity conservation.
15.   Second, greater emphasis was placed on wetland management planning. The project provided
a small amount of funds (less than $50,000) to support the restoration of the Stensovsko-Zhebrianski
plavni (SZP). The importance of restoring the SZP was recognized during project preparation, and
during implementation it became a focus of cooperation between the DPA and two international
partners: the Dutch Institute for Inland Water Management and Waste Water Treatment (RIZA) and
WWF-International (Greene Danube Program).
16.   Restoration of SZP. The floodplain of the delta between Kilia and Vilkovo, including fish
ponds, pasture and croplands, is largely enclosed by dikes. In this area, only the SZP has retained
important natural values, and is one of the most important sites in the Black Sea region for migratory
and resident waterfowl. The hydrology of the plavny is entirely regulated and is affected by
agricultural runoff from surrounding farmlands.
17.   Over the last 30-50 years, the growth of reeds in the plavny has reduced its open water habitat
and impeded water flows, and the fisheries and muskrat population traditionally used by the local
community have declined. With the declining local economy, up to 200 people regularly fish in and
around the SZP, resulting in unsustainable harvesting of fish. In addition to fisheries, the plavny is
used by members of the local hunters and sports fishermen association, which contributes to the
management of the site.
18.   During project preparation, the need was recognized to restore water circulation to the plavny
and to undertake proactive management measures to restore habitat productivity, such as controlled
burns, grazing, and mechanical removal of the dense reedbeds. The project laid the foundation for the
DPA's management of the SZP, by financing wetlands management training, the technical studies
needed to study management alternatives and obtain government approval for management measures,
preparation of the SZP management plan, and the first stage of its implementation (see Box 1).
19.   Monitoring and Database Management. The project addressed the need to improve the
understanding of baseline conditions of the delta ecosystem and to develop a monitoring program that
serves the management needs of the DPA. In the first three years of the project, a scientific program
was designed and implemented under the guidance of a Scientific Advisory Group. This three-year
program produced good results on the fauna and flora, the research justification for wetland restoration
activities and the biosphere reserve boundaries and zoning, resource use studies, and a monitoring
system. The detailed studies of the project region also identified species not previously known to occur
within Ukraine and those not previously known to science. The results of these research and
monitoring activities are being summarized in a monograph "Conservation and Management of
Biodiversity of the Danube Biosphere Reserve". This component also included training in GIS,
conservation biology, and presentation of research and monitoring results at a number of international

20.   The component had two principal impacts. First, it gained broader acceptance among
scientists and the MEPNS on proactive management activities such as the use of fire in reedbed
management. Although local communities set small fires around the margins of plavnis to control reed
growth and maintain productivity for grazing, fire was not an accepted tool for plavny management by
the Academy of Sciences and MEPNS prior to the project. The permissions needed to initiate pilot
burns in Stensovsko Zhebrianski Plavny were obtained based on the results of the research program,
which demonstrated that controlled burns increase biodiversity levels in senescent reedbeds and are
needed to help maintain biodiversity levels of the Reserve. Second, the investments in research and
monitoring activities improved the capacity of reserve staff to implement the operational programn and
contributed to improved international cooperation on conservation biology issues of the delta.
21.   Biosphere Reserve Establishment. An important part of the project objective was to create a
biosphere reserve and expand the protected area to include the key wetland and upland sites of
Stensovsko-Zhebrianski Plavny, Yermakov Island, and additional wetlands of the Kiliya Delta. The
key steps in formation of the biosphere reserve are as follows:
i)    The process for creation of the biosphere reserve was initiated in 1994, through a
Presidential Decree and its adoption by the Supreme Soviet, of a country-wide
protected area program that 'reserved' the territories of protected areas to be developed
over a period of years. This step of first 'reserving' territories is standard practise in
Ukraine; it initiates a sequence of activities for establishment of the protected area
ii)   In 1996, the MEPNS completed its reports for establishment of the reserve, drawing on
the results of the project-financed scientific program, and initiated its consultations with
local and regional government, and kolhozes, state organizations (owners and users),
and other stakeholders (hunting and fishing organizations and local peoples). Based on
these results, the regional (oblast) government signaled its approval for the biosphere
reserve.
iii)   The 'Danube Biosphere Reserve', covering 46,403 hectares, was established by
Presidential Decree in 1998. The inclusion of Stensovsko-Zhebrianski Plavny into the
DBR occurred by transfer of land from the Ministry of Forestry, and the remaining
sites were acquired by 'secondary title', wherein ownership remains with the Ministry
of Forestry or local collectives. For all lands in the reserve, the DBA Authority is
responsible for ensuring that land uses are consistent with the objectives of biodiversity
conservation and sustainable use.
iv)   In February 1999, the Council for the Man and the Biosphere Program (UNESCO)
awarded diplomas designating the Ukrainian Danube Biosphere Reserve and the
RomanianlUkrainian Bilateral Biosphere Reserve.
22.   The MEPNS attempted to include additional areas within the Danube Biosphere Reserve. The
most important of these were adjoining agricultural lands, the runoff from which impact the Stensovsko
Zhebrianski Plavny, and Lake Kutai. However, the agricultural kolhozes and local communities
resisted inclusion of additional land due to concern over the impact of inclusion in the biosphere reserve
on economic activities.

23.   The Central Board of National Nature Park and Reserve Affairs (CBNNPRA) considers the
current Danube Biosphere Reserve boundaries as a first phase effort, and expects to continue with a
second phase in the future (tentatively planned for 2003). The Danube Biosphere Reserve Authority
(DBRA) has a pragmatic approach to the issue. First, it understands the concerns of the local
population and considers that one of the DBRA's missions is to demonstrate the positive role of the
reserve, especially in demonstrating sustainable use of its resources. If these efforts are successful,
local communities will be more supportive of the Reserve and their role in its management. Second, it
is concerned about keeping its land and resources management responsibilities in line with current
budgetary and staff resources. Finally, whereas inclusion of agricultural kolkhozes and villages within
the reserve fits better the mandate of a biosphere reserve, the local communities elected to take a 'wait
and see' approach to membership.
24.   Public awareness and education. Under this component, the Reserve implemented activities
to raise awareness in local communities on why the delta is important to them, and worked with
various actors in the international community on activities supporting protection of the Danube Delta
and the Black Sea The DPA organized a number of public education activities for different target
audiences. The general public was targeted through regular contributions to local and regional
newspapers, dissemination of brochures and calendars, televised news reports of Reserve activities and
educational videos prepared under the project, and by an annual "March of Parks" event where the
Reserve hosted the local community to a festival of environmental activities. Kiosks were established
at locations frequented by fishermen and posted with information on the biosphere reserve and updated
fishing regulations. An ecological education program for school children and teachers was delivered
for three years at the Reserve's visitors' information center, for which the project provided equipment
(video, furniture, displays) and educational materials. The design of the education program was
informed by the results of a survey of public attitudes on the importance of environmental issues, in
particular about nature conservation and their views on the reserve.
25.   NGO training and small grants program. A partnership was formed with WWF
International, Green Danube Program, to provide assistance for strengthening the participation and
effectiveness of Ukrainian NGOs in protecting and restoring Danube Delta ecosystems (see Box 2).
The first phase was held in WWF's Environmental Education Centre, Neusiedler See National Park in
Austria, and focused on building business and technical skills through lectures and exercises on: (i)
organization and management of NGOs; (ii) project management, and (iii) environmental education
and monitoring. The participants included representatives of NGOs from the project region, including
Romania, and from Kyiv.
26.   Based on an assessment of the needs and capacities of 10 NGOs active in wetland conservation
activities, WWF-International implemented a second phase program in the project region. In this
phase, action plans were developed for regional NGO network building, project identification, and
project implementation. The plans focused on involving local communities, strategic environmental
education activities, targeted media work, and project communication plans, and the organisational and
equipment needs to support these.
27.   The participants rated the training program as highly satisfactory, and felt that it could be
improved by designing it with a better understanding of Ukrainian conditions. For example,
fundraising and campaigning techniques successful in western Europe are generally not relevant to the



9
socioeconomic circumstances of Ukraine. Nonetheless, the participants indicated that the program
provided a good foundation for the NGOs to adapt international practices to local conditions.
28.    A small grants program (SGP) was initiated in 1998 to better engage local communities in the
project, to strengthen the education and awareness component, and to provide practical opportunities to
strengthen NGOs (see Box 2). The SGP was well designed and implemented. Several consultants
worked under the direction of a steering committee to design and implement the program. Four reports
were prepared and disseminated: (i) a description of the program and 15 thematic areas eligible for
funding, invitation for proposals, proposal requirements, and criteria for selection (1997); (ii) abstracts
of the 86 proposals received and contact information for their authors/organisations (1998); (iii) a
summary of the selection results and comments by the committee; and (iv) a summary of results for the
22 projects implemented (1999).

D. Major Factors Affecting the Project
29.   Two positive factors that affected the project were the Recipient's experience working with the
Bank and the strong interest of several intemational organizations in the project:
i)    Experience with implementation of Bank projects. When the project became effective
in 1994, the Recipient had gained experience with Bank/GEF projects through
implementation of the Transcarpathian Biodiversity Protection Project, an SDR400,000
grant project that had been under implementation for one year when the Danube Delta
project was launched. The ICR for the Transcarpathian project noted that the PIU had
spent considerable time learning Bank procedures and in finding innovative solutions to
the in-country conditions that hindered project implementation. The same PIU was
responsible for both projects, and the experience learned under the Transcarpathian
project was applied by the PIU to the Danube Delta project, with good results.
ii)   International interest in the project. From the outset of implementation, there was
strong interest on the part of international organizations in forming partnerships with
the Ukraine MEPNS and Danube Plavny Authority on implementation of the project.
One of these partners was the Dutch RIZA, the General Directorate of Public Works
and Water Management, which provides technical assistance in water resources
management and wetlands conservation worldwide, with special emphasis on
improving the management of delta ecosystems. The project's cooperation with RIZA
spanned the project implementation period, and is planned to continue in the
operational phase.
30.   Two factors that slowed project implementation were difficulties with building construction
and government licensing requirements of the Special Account:
i)    Headquarters construction. The project financed the construction of headquarters
building for the Danube Plavny Authority, a contract for which was originally awarded
to a private sector construction firm. The lack of experience of private sector
involvement, by both the construction contractor and the government institutes
traditionally responsible for design and construction, contributed to delays in
construction. Owing to the rise in construction costs and difficulty in completing the
headquarters building within the project timetable, the project's legal agreement
(between the Bank and Ukraine) was amended to allow the use of project funds to
purchase a newly constructed building for the headquarters. The headquarters building
activity was completed two years later than planned. The delay slowed the completion
of certain components, and diverted attention that should have been devoted to
wetlands management activities late in the project.
ii)    Licensing of the SpecialAccount. In the final year of the project, the Government of
Ukraine required licensing and on-going involvement of the National Bank for the use
of foreign bank accounts by private and public sector organizations. As a result of
substantial delays in obtaining the National Bank's license for the operation of the
Special Account, disbursement was interrupted and the completion of project activities
was slowed.



11
31.   Finally, the project was influenced by the fact it was implemented during a difficult financial
period for the country, with cuts in budgetary support for most state institutions, including the National
Academy of Sciences. The reserve staff usually received their salaries from one to four months late,
which reduced staff morale. As a result of the uncertain financial conditions, the reserve director
adopted a conservative, risk averse approach to taking on management responsibilities which took into
consideration his ability to obtain financing for the recurrent costs. The difficult financial conditions
also promoted a more proactive approach to developing income generating activities such as tourism.
D. Project Sustainability
32.   Government budgetary support for the Danube Biosphere Reserve was leveraged by the GEF
project. This budgetary support, along with the strong ownership and commitment of the main
stakeholders, means that key benefits of the project will continue to be achieved in the operational
phase. However, parts of the operational plan which are central to the project's sustainability will
depend on the reserve's success in obtaining additional financing. While there are indications that grant
support will be made available by other donors, this is not certain. Therefore, while key aspects of the
project are sustainable, there remains some uncertainty over whether the project as a whole is
sustainable.
33.   With respect to the project's improvements in reserve management and biodiversity
conservation that resulted from its human resources development activities, the project is likely to be
sustainable through the medium term (e.g., 5-10 years). The staff is relatively young and highly
committed to continuing with project activities. The project's emphasis on 'learning by doing'
activities, supported by focused international technical assistance' resulted in a strengthened Reserve
staff capable of handling the core activities of the operational plan without substantial external
assistance/investments in human resources. For the most part, the Academy of Sciences or the
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety do not have the budgetary resources to
continue with the various international training programs which were initiated under the project.
However, since project completion, Ukraine has maintained its participation in Europe-wide
conservation and sustainable development discussions, in part through its partnerships with
international organisations such as Wetlands International and World Wildlife Fund.
34.   With respect to expensive activities such as wetlands restoration and applied research, the
sustainability is uncertain. The reserve will continue with some wetlands restoration and applied
research activities, but the state is unlikely to substantially increase the reserve's budget under current
economic conditions. Implementation of the full operational plan will therefore depend on external
financing and on the reserve's success in generating revenue.
35.   Regarding external financing, a US$2M project in wetlands conservation and public education
financed by the Dutch government and implemented through the WWF-Greene Danube Program is
proposed to continue with several activities initiated under the project. Regarding income generation,
the by-laws for the biosphere reserve include the right for the reserve authority to operate a revenue
account, fed by revenues from fines, resource use fees, fee-paying visitors, and donations. This
revenue account was created to supplement the modest budget from the Academy of Sciences for the
biosphere reserve's operational expenses. The Reserve is also marketing its modest ecotourism
opportunities to bird watching groups and tourists, emphasizing its rich bird life, scenic qualities, and



12
location (the "0 km location of the Danube River"). Finally, the conservation efforts of the Reserve
remain of considerable interest to donors and other partners. The Reserve staff has started applying for
small grants and has met with some success. Each of these activities has been designed to generate a
modest supplement to the budget that will contribute to the sustainability of project benefits.
E. Bank Performance
36.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory throughout preparation and implementation. The
project was well prepared: the project design was fully appropriate to the project objectives, and the
Recipient was comfortable with the level of detail on project activities, budget, and implementation
arrangements found in the project document. Starting early in implementation, the Bank provided
assistance with procurement, focused on human resources development activities that were useful in
implementing the project and preparing the Recipient for the operational phase, and assisted with
facilitating partnerships with international organizations interested in the project. The Bank was
responsive to the additional supervision needs not foreseen during preparation, by accessing trust funds
for technical issues and training. The project was continuously supervised from project launch through
completion by a technical specialist, by a highly qualified resident mission staff member and other
resident mission staff experienced with the needs of the project and with Ukraine.
F. Recipient Performance
37.   The Recipient's perfornance was satisfactory. The project was disbursed over a five year
period and its completion required one six-month extension. The legal covenants were continuously
enforced. The project was implemented largely as planned, with small adaptive changes made in
consultation with the Bank. The principal beneficiary of the project was the Danube Plavny Authority
(re-named the Danube Biosphere Reserve Authority at the end of the project), which consisted of a
relatively small staff with nearly no experience with bilateral or multilateral financed projects or
organizations. The reserve staff performed well in adapting its previous mandate of monitoring and
protection functions typical of a strictly protected area to include wetland management and public
education and involvement. The DPA was assisted by the MEPNS, the CBNNPRA, Academy of
Sciences, and the PFLJ. The Academy of Sciences contributed modest budgetary resources, substantial
technical support for the scientific program, and oversight with regard to the Man and the Biosphere
Program. The performance of the MEPNS, the authorized representative for the Recipient, was
satisfactory in facilitating all aspects of the project. The PIU's efforts and results in procurement and
as facilitators of project implementation were excellent, particularly in the face of the country's
extensive regulations and procedures.
H. Assessment of Outcome
38.   The project had positive and satisfactory outcomes with respect to human resources
development, expanded vision for protected area management in Ukraine, and improved biodiversity
protection and use within the Danube Biosphere Reserve':
i)    Establishment of new approaches to the management of protected areas in Ukraine.
The preparation of a management plan for the Danube Biosphere Reserve and the early
'The Recipient's comment letter (Appendix B) recommended that the project's outcome be rated as highly satisfactory.



13
stages of its implementation represents an important step in Ukrainian protected areas
management. Prior to the project, the typical model for protected area management in
Ukraine was that of a strict nature reserve or national nature park for which a 'territorial
organization plan' was prepared. The territorial organization plan has basic elements of
a management plan, but its focus on boundaries and restrictions on land and resource
use is a static approach to protected areas management. The management plan
prepared under the project emphasizes a participatory process for defining objectives
and the technical habitat management measures that are needed to achieve these
objectives. This is the first protected area management plan adopted in Ukraine that
prescribes proactive habitat management measures, in this case for reedbeds and based
on water management, controlled burning, and establishment of regimes for the use of
its resources.
The approaches to wetlands management and the plan itself were developed in
collaboration with international partners such as Wetlands International, the Dutch
RIZA, and AlDEnvironment (a Dutch-based NGO) over a period of four years, and in
this sense are the tangible outcome of the international cooperation activities financed
by the project and cofinanciers such as RIZA.
ii)    Development of human resources and integration of the reserve into European
conservation initiatives. The project helped to build the staff skills that were needed to
achieve the project objectives, and which will be needed to implement the operational
phase of the project. The project also led to collaboration and partnerships on delta
conservation/natural resource management issues with colleagues and organizations
elsewhere in central and western Europe. The current activities with the Dutch RIZA
and Austrian WWF-International that were catalyzed by the project are planned to
continue in the operational phase.
iii)   Improved protection and management of the biodiversity of the Danube Biosphere
Reserve. The Ukrainian Danube Biosphere Reserve was established in 1998 through
the addition of key wetland and upland sites, a plan for its management was prepared
and is being implemented, and reserve staff are better trained and equipped to fulfill the
reserve's mandate of improved management and protection of the biosphere reserve's
biodiversity. The Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (Romania/Ukraine) was also
established in 1999, shortly before the Completion Mission, and it's function has not yet
been evaluated.
I. Future Operations
39.   The Recipient has identified activities in the following six areas that are the priorities for the
operational period from 1999 to 2002: Reserve infrastructure and resource management, wetlands
restoration, research and monitoring, public education and awareness, regional and international
cooperation, and tourism development. Table 2 summarizes the activities and their estimated costs..
An estimated US$150,000 will be required annually to finance the plan over the next 3.5 years.
Excluding salaries, the reserve can expect to cover approximately one-third of the investnents needed
from the Academy of Sciences. The reserve will attempt to finance the remaining two-thirds from
income generating activities, user fees collected for the use of resources (e.g., fish, reedbeds) in



14
selected parts of the reserve, and from additional international financing. The Recipient is working
with WWF-Intemational on a proposal to finance some of the expensive wetlands restoration (i.e.,
sluice gate restoration) and public education activities identified in Table 2.
J. Key Lessons Learned
40.   The key lessons learned from the Recipient's and Bank's perspectives are:
a     Well-planned public education and awareness activities are needed early in the project
to get the public involved in a meaningful way. One way to catalyse the education and
awareness activities would have been to initiate the project with an awareness and
education activities through the NGO development and small grants program.
b.    The creation of a biosphere reserve should-be undertaken in phases to allow the
administration and local communities opportunity to understand and adequately plan
for its added financial and managerial responsibilities.
c.    Future projects should seek ways to simplify Ukrainian requirements and procedures
early in project implementation, in order to avoid delays in its progress.
d.    If the protected areas administration is to work effectively with local communities,
technical studies to guide sustainable use of reserve resources (e.g., hunting and
fishing) should be undertaken early in project implementation, in collaboration with
local users and linked to public education activities.
e.    Continuity in supervision responsibility contributes greatly the relationship between the
Bank and its client.

Danube Delta Biodiversity Project (TF 28654), Completion Mission
Biodiversity Conservation in the Azov-Black Sea Corridor (TF 28961), Pre-appraisal Mission
World Bank Mission, April 1999
Aide-Memoire
1.    A World Bank mission consisting of Messrs. Brylski and Slenzak (ECSSD) and Ms.
Heitman (consultant) worked in Kyiv from March 22-26 to pre-appraise the Biodiversity
Conservation in the Azov-Black Corridor project. Messrs. Brylski and Slenzak carried out the
Completion Mission for the Danube Delta GEF project in Vilkovo and Kyiv from April 8-22. The
mission thanks the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety (MEPNS), Academy
of Sciences, Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, and Project Implementation Unit (PIU,
InterEcocentre) for their hospitality and assistance during this and all previous missions during the
implementation of the Danube Delta project. The mission was well-supported by the Bank's
Resident Mission in Kyiv. This Aide Memoir is subject to confirmation by World Bank
management.
Danube Delta Project Completion Mission
2.    The mission worked with the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, Academy of
Sciences, MEPNS, and the PMU to discuss the project achievements and operation plan in
Vilkovo (at the Danube Delta) and in Kyiv.
3.    The Project will close on June 30, 1999, after one six extension. At the time of the
Completion Mission, the funds were 95% disbursed. Annex 1 and its attachments contain draft
sections of the ICR and the operational plan.
4.    In Vilkovo, the mission participated in discussions between the DDBRA, Dr. Voloshyn,
Vice-Director, Academy of Sciences; Dr. Stetsenko, Director, Central Board for Nature
Conservation Reserve and representatives of the Romania Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (Dr.
Baboianu, Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Authority, Dr. Staras, Danube Delta Institute, and
Ms. Rachita, World Bank Team Leader for the Romania Danube Delta project). The discussions
focused on project achievements and on the steps needed to operationalise the recently created
biltateral (transboundary) Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve.
5.    The Special Account for this project and other Bank projects in Ukraine have been frozen
for approximately four months as a result of delays in obtaining a license to meet the National
Bank's requirement for accessing foreign bank accounts. When it became evident that approval
from the Central Bank to continue to use the Special Account was not likely to occur before the
1



closing date of the project, the MEPNS transferred the funds back to the Bank, where they are
now available for use through direct payment. In order to make full use of the remaining grant
funds, the MEPNS needs to contract with its PMU (InterEcocentre) to finalise procurement of
the remaining goods and services.
6.    Next Steps:
* If the MEPNS is to use the remaining grantfunds, it will need to authorise the PMU to
proceed with preparing contractsfor the remaining goods and services, so that they can be
paid by direct payment.
*  The Bank shouldprovide a translated version of its draft ICR to the MEPNS as soon as
feasible, and not later than May 7.
*  The MEPNS shouldprovide its comment letter on the Bank's ICR within several weeks of its
receipt.
a The Academy of Sciences and MEPNS should inform the Bank of the next steps it will take
for working with Romania on making the bilateral biosphere reserve operational, so that this
can be included in the Implementation Completion Report.
Biodiversity Conservation in the Azov-Black Sea Corridor Project
7.    A three-day workshop was held at the Resident Mission to review the project design with
the main stakeholders. The workshop was well-attended, with about 25 participants, including
representatives of key national and local stakeholders. From the local/regional level, the following
were represented: six oblast governments/MEPNS, Crimea State Environmental Protection
Committee, farm collective, State Agricultural Institute, and NGOs. From the national level, the
following were represented: MEPNS and Central Board for Nature Conservation, Parliamentary
Committee, National Agency for Development and European Integration, and Presidential
Administration office.
8.    The workshop participants confirmed their strong support for the project and worked
together in updating the project design, project outputs and performance indicators. A key issue
discussed during the workshop was the project implementation arrangements. The Bank
recommended an implementation arrangement that gives the national MEPNS responsibility for
overall project implementation and local (oblast) level responsibility for key decisions on project
activities and integration of activities within and between oblasts in the project region.
9.    Next Steps:
* The Bank should arrange for translation of the updatedproject description materials and
provide these to the MEPNS and workshop participants by May 7.
2



7TheAMEPNS shouldprovide written comments on the project design and implementation
arrangements within two weeks of receiving the translated version.
* The mission requested the assistance of the Central Boardfor Nature Conservation in
drafting/finalising the budgetsfor the project components

Re: Danube Delta Biodiversity Project, GET GRANT TF 28654
Dear Ms. Chu,
The Ministry for Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety of Ukraine has
considered the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) on the Danube Delta
Biodiversity Project prepared by the World Bank and considers that it comprehensive
and completely reflects the information and results of project implementation. The
Ministry has no any objections to the ICR. Taking into consideration significant input
of the World Bank in planning and implementation of the project and its high efficiency
the Ministry deems it appropriate to change rating in the table 1: Summary of
Assessment of the ICR as follows:
* the World Bank efforts on "Identification" and "Preparation Assistance" should be
rated as "highly satisfactory";
* "Assessment of Outcome" can be rated as "highly satisfactory" as well.
We have a pleasure to inform you that based on the results of the GEF project it
became possible to undertake new important steps in international efforts to protect
nature in the Danube Delta. According to the decision of International Co-ordinating
Council of the UNESCO Programme on Man and Biosphere of 2 February, 1999 the
Bilateral Romanian-Ukrainian Biosphere Reserve "Danube Delta" was established. The
inauguration of the reserve took place in Ukraine on September 23-24, 1999.
The Ministry would like to express its great satisfaction on fruitful cooperation
with the World Bank on the project.
Sincerely yours,
Deputy Minister                         enko

covering about 600,000 ha. The Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta and its associated
wetlands cover some 150,000 ha in the southwest part of the Odessa region. The Kiliya
branch of the Danube, with 60% of its total flow, fonns the border between Romania and
Ukraine, but for its last part lies entirely within Ukraine. The delta region encompasses a
large number of islands, marshes, tributaries and canals, lakes with aquatic plants, and a
mosaic of forests, grasslands and dunes in the wetland area. The lagoons or limans to the
north of the Kiliya branch are a special feature of the Ukrainian Danube Delta wetland
system. Land formations in the delta are dynamic, and within the last 10 to 20 years a
new generation of islands has been formed. The flora of the Danube Biosphere Reserve
(estimated during project implementation) comprised 950 identified species of vascular
plants. These include some unique flora complexes. Fauna consist of more than 5,000
species, including 252 species of birds. These include the rare pygmy cormorant and red-
breasted goose, and the common and Dalmatian pelican. Mammals (39 species in total)
include the otter, muskrat, mink, little ermine, and wildcat. The fish fauna is represented
by 91 species. There is strong evidence that some species are in decline due to pollution
and over-fishing.
A.2. Purpose
The GEF Danube Delta project was closely linked with two other GEF and other
donor-funded regional projects, one for the Danube River basin, and one for the Black
Sea. The Danube River basin project had attracted funding of US$ 56.7 million by 1994
year and focused on preparation of an action plan, improved river basin management, a
regional environmental survey, inventory of biological resources, strengthening
monitoring, data management and applied research. The Black Sea program, for US$ 9.3
million, had as its objectives reversal of environmental degradation of the Black Sea, and
rational natural resource management, development of a pilot pollutant monitoring
program, database, policy and legislative enhancement, preparation of investment
proposals and donor mobilization.
While the Romanian portion of the delta had been the focus of considerable
international interest, the Ukrainian portion of the delta had as yet received very little



support from the international community. Yet the Danube Delta functions as an
integrated series of ecosystems, all of which require protection. Initially, the Danube
Delta GEF project planned assistance only to the Romanian part of the delta because
Ukraine was not yet a member of the Bank. During the project identification, the scope of
the project was amended to provide parallel support to the Danube Plavny Reserve (DP)
in Ukraine and US$ 1.5 millions of the US$ 6 millions allocated to the Danube Delta
Project were earmarked for it. The relative neglect by the international community of the
Ukrainian portion of the delta highlights the importance of the GEF project to Ukraine.
A.3. Objectives:
The project objectives were to:
(a)   help develop sustainable management of the Ukrainian part of the delta
and protect its biodiversity, and also to improve the management of the
Danube Basin, Delta and Black Sea as part of a much larger regional
program.
(b)   implement governmental policies concerning the protection of biodiversity
and extend protected areas which were top priority to this GEF project.
(c)   link and coordinate the F Danube Delta Biodiversity project with two
other GEF and other donor-funded regional projects, one for the Danube
River basin, and one for the Black Sea.
B.   Project Objectives
The Project Objectives were to:
(a)   protect and enhance the Ukrainian portion of the delta ecosystems and
contribute to conservation of biodiversity within the delta;
(b)   strengthen the capacity of Danube Plavny Reserve Authority (DPA) to
expand and manage the protected areas effectively, and continue the
activities in the operational phase;
(c)   work with local community groups to introduce participatory protected
area management in the Ukrainian part of the Danube Delta and ensure
sustainable resource use in it;
(d)   coordinate the project with the GEF Romania Danube Delta Biodiversity
Project.



B.1.  Project Description
The project components were summarized as follows:
B3.2.1. Institutional strengthening: the Project had to provide for the expansion
and restructuring of DPA to develop and implement effective management
plans for protected areas in and around the delta, through training and
technical assistance, and provision of infrastructure including an office and
visitors center, construction of a house for the office, transport and
scientific equipment and its maintenance, staff increase;
B.2.2. Strengthening the warden's section: through staff increases, training in
patrolling and protected area management, provision of equipment, and
field offices and residential accommodation;
B.2.3. Strengthening ecosystem monitoring: including flora, fauna and
hydrological monitoring and creation of database and simple Geographical
Information System (GIS), to assist with the development of management
plans;
B.2.4. Pilot wetland restoration: including restoration of hydrological circulation
to the Stentsovsko-Zhebrijanskie Plavny (SZP) and monitoring of the
impact, restoration of the Vilkovo town canals, studies for restoration of
Yermakov Island partially being used by the farm for cattle and horse
breeding, and studies of marketing alternatives for ecologically-friendly
cultivated produce from Lenin fisheries kolkhoz;
B.2.5. Public awareness and community involvement in protected area
management both by DP staff and non-governmental organizations
(NGOs);
B.2.6. Biosphere Reserve Establishment: developing and implementing a
program for protected area expansion and creation of a biosphere reserve
through land use studies and using information provided from monitoring,
and community participation, focusing in the first phase on protecting
three priority areas (Kiliya Delta, SZP and Yermakov Island).
B.2.7. Regional Initiatives and Coordination: with GEF activities in Romania,
the GEF Black Sea Environment Management Program and other
international initiatives;
B.2.8. Endowment Fund: finance technical assistance for establishing a Trust
Fund for financing recurrent costs of the biosphere reserve.



C.   Evaluation of Project Objectives
C.1.  The objectives of the GEF and project were clearly defined and they took into
account the social, economic, institutional and financial aspects of the real needs for the
protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, and management of the Danube Delta.
C.2.  During the implementation of the project new objectives were defined:
*  within the framework of the project in accordance with component 5 Public
Awareness, a small grants program (SGP) was initiated in 1998 to better engage local
communities in the management, to strengthen the education and awareness
component, and to provide practical opportunities to strengthen NGOs;
*  for joining efforts for protection and management of the Danube Delta as an entire
system Ukraine initiated an idea on the creation of a bilateral Romanian-Ukrainian
biosphere reserve.
C.3.  During implementation some activities have been changed.
*  in order to establish the scientific background for the creation of the Danube
Biosphere Reserve (DBR), extension its area and preparation of Management Plans a
Scientific Program was elaborated and carried out;
*  instead of construction of a house for the director his apartment was renovated, etc.,
and some had to be rejected,
*  pilot blocking the open connection between Danube water and one lake (" Lazarkin
Kut") in the DP reserve was rejected because during research it was identified the
"kut" would lose its great fishing and biodiversity significance after the blocking;
o  the canal dredging activities were not completed fully as defined in the project due to
the request of the Vilkovo City Council which took into account the opinion of the
local inhabitants rejecting further works;
9  the allocated US$4,000 for studying the possible conversion of Lenin Kolkhoz fish
ponds to a more remunerative production, preferably for the eastern European market,
was spent for another purpose because of substantial changes in the economic state of
Ukraine and region.
These changes in the objectives and activities had a positive impact to the project as
far as they provided an- integrated approach and allowed to achieve the most important
results by means of more effective use of project funds.



D.   Achievement of Objective
The project was implemented largely as planned and the achievement of GEF and
project objectives was mostly substantial. This has repeatedly been emphasized by the
Government, MEPNS, local authorities, officials. All the DBR's visitor are under great
impression of the project outcomes.
D.1.  Achievement of Project Objectives
Objective D.1.(a)   Concerning the protection of the Ukrainian portion of the delta
ecosystems and contribution to conservation of biodiversity within the delta the project
has facilitated:
*  increase of the warden staff (increased up to 13 ), creation of a special training
prograrn for wardens, warden training course in Netherlands, France, Romania, on-
going training in Vilkovo, MEPNS-organized training, warden training manuals
(wardens have been trained in regulation, law enforcement, patrolling, public relation
and park management), equipping of the wardens, three warden stations were built
and the renovation of a fourth. The stations were constructed to provide basic
facilities (sanitary, sleeping, kitchen for the wardens and with extra room for fee-
paying researchers and occasional tourists), vehicles and boats and outboard motors
were purchased, a radio-telephone system covering the total area of DBR was
installed;
*  designing and implementing a Scientific Program. The main components of the
Scientific Program were: analysis of ecological interplay of the main components of
the Danube Delta ecosystems with the goal of elaboration of management plans for
the DBR areas, development of background for advanced nature protection regulation
of DBR area and methods for the management of its particular parts with the aim of
protecting biodiversity of DBR, assessment of the resource potential of various areas
of DBR, preparation of management plans for DBR and its particular areas, hydro-
ecological, phyto- and zoo-monitoring. Scientists of research institutes, universities
and DBR's staff were involved and relevant reports and project proposals were made.
The program produced good results on the inventory of fauna and flora, the research
justification for wetland restoration activities and the boundaries and zoning of the
planned biosphere reserve, resource use studies and a monitoring system. It can be
noted that 18.5% of vascular plant species and 63% of bird species occurring in
Ukraine became under protection in DBR. Scientists have found 36 species of insects
listed in the Red Data Book of Ukraine and European Red Dada List, 7 species are
totally new for science and 19 species are new for Ukraine. The table below provides
data on numbers of flora and fauna species reported for DP, and corresponding
figures estimated for DBR by the scientific program.

It shows significant increasing an amount of species, which will be protected by the
creation of DBR. The results of these research and monitoring activities are partly being
summarized in a monograph " Biodiversity of the Danube Delta Reserve, protection and
management", a design for creation of DBR and the Management Plan for DBR;
- establishing the DBR in Ukraine in 1998, covering an area of 46,402.9 ha and
extending the area of the former Danube Plavny Reserve (14,851 ha).
The DBR's staff was strengthened through an increase in numbers, a training program and
technical assistance activities which introduced international best practices in wetlands
protection and management. Creation of the DBR provided opportunities to manage
natural protected areas in a more efficient way, for protection of the unique delta
ecosystems of Ukraine, for scientific research and monitoring; it also gave an important
impetus for region's sustainable development. Creation of the bilateral Romanian-
Ukrainian biosphere reserve will result in further enhancement of international
cooperation for conservation of biodiversity within the Danube Delta.
Objective B.1. (b)   The objective of strengthening the capacity of DPA to expand and
manage the protected areas effectively was accomplished in a few directions:
*  increasing of the total staff of the DPA has been made from 14 to 35, several higher
level staff (GIS, environmental education, ecotourism development) were hired,
*  general training has been provided through: on-site English training, wetland study
tour, on-site wetland management course, ecosystem monitoring, GIS, conservation
biology, vegetation mapping, 'bio-business' workshops and training, USAID study
tour of US protected areas, delta management workshop, participation in 6
international and many Ukrainian congresses and conferences;



*  DBR has obtained its own juridical status and revenue account fed by revenues from
fines, resource use fees, fee-paying visitors, and donations;
*  the headquarters office had been built together with a garage, maintenance area, dock
and mooring facilities, and equipped with rooms designated to serve as offices,
conference rooms, research facilities, lodging facilities for ecotourism programs;
*  purchased of one apartment for employees, renovated of 3 staff apartments;
*  DBR had been equipped with furniture, office, radio-telephone system covering all
the DBR's territory, monitoring and laboratory equipment (computers,
communications audiovisual equipment etc.), supported by 3 vehicles, gauge tools
etc.
Objective D.1.(c)   On the Ukrainian side of the Danube due to
modification/destruction of natural habitats specific management strategies were needed
for wildlife, hydrological regimes, agriculture, forestry and ecotourism management in
the delta. The data from the developed Scientific Program has been synthesized to
prepare the draft management plan for DBR (for the following DBR's parts:
Stentsovsko-Zhebriansky Plavny (SZP), Yermakov Island, Kiliya delta and Zhebrianska
ridge) in regard to hunting, grazing, fisheries, farming etc. There were fed into the overall
Biosphere Reserve Establishment Component to ensure appropriate and realistic
management criteria, legislation, zoning (DBR was divided into core, regulated economic
activity, buffer and anthropogenic zones), as well as serve to provide ongoing direction
for the flora and fauna monitoring activities. It is important that the process of
establishing DBR was done in a participatory manner, between government, NGOs, local
communities, hunters, fishermen and inhabitants with mutual understanding of the need
for protection of biodiversity and ensuring the sustainable resource use in the region.
To prepare local community, landusers, landowners and other stakeholders, the DPA
and InterEcoCentre developed a Public Education/Awareness Plan which has being
implemented through the following main activities:
* mass media campaign ( 8 videos on nature conservation DBR, broadcast on regional
TV and distributed to local schools and organizations);
*  educational activities to be offered at the headquarters/visitor center (Reserve's
visitors center was renovated, equipped and is operational);
*  children's environmental education (an ecological education program for school
children and teachers was delivered for three years at the visitors center);
*  an annual "March of Parks" event where the Reserve hosted the local community to a
festival of environmental activities;



* a series meetings and workshops occurred involving the local community;
*  4 Reserve staff represent DBR in local goverrnent and resource user/stakeholder
groups;
* ecotourism activities (the headquarters office has lodging facilities which may be
used by scientists, bird watchers, photographers etc. ; in order to provide facilities
allowing access for visitors to watch large numbers of migratory birds and waterfowl
an ecological trail and bird watching house were build at the southern tip of the
Danube delta; the 0 km Danube mark was put in place);
* publications (published are about 100 articles in local newspaper, calendars, posters;
the environmental column in the local newspaper "Page for children" is published
regularly);
* environmental actions (information boards at the fish station are established and
regularly updated);
* NGOs training in Austria, Odessa and locally.
Great influence upon NGOs had the Small Grants Program which was implemented
by the InterEcoCentre. After the competition among 86 applications 22 projects were
selected and accomplished. Approximately 500 children and adults were engaged in
implementing these projects. The project financed a range of activities, including a
conference on the ecology and cultural history of the project area, stream-side
afforestation and restoration, environmental films festival, brochures and posters on
biodiversity conservation, an evironmental summer camp for children etc. Under the
accomplishment of the program, a two-day festival was held in Vilkovo.
To support local communities Vilkovo canals were dredged and public loading dock
was constructed. It had a great positive effect in building relations between the DBR and
the local community.
Based on the results of introduced participatory management approach the regional
government and the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine signed their written approvals for
establishing the biosphere reserve and the President of Ukraine signed the Decree on
establishing DBR on August 10, 1998.
The Danube Biosphere Reserve Authority (DBRA) understands the concerns of the
local population and considers that one of the DBRA's missions is to demonstrate the
positive role of the reserve, especially in participatory protected area management and
demonstrating sustainable use of its resources. The DBRA had opened a campaign and
the prepared draft management plan for DBR and in particular for SZP drew great
attention of scientists, landusers and landowners, inhabitants, NGOs, officials,
government, MEPNS, RIZA, WWF . The management plan for DBR was discussed with



substantial involvement of local communities through a series of meetings and workshop
and supported public awareness activities in the local community. It was endorsed by
the stakeholders and published in 1999.
The growth of reeds in the SZP have reduced its open water habitat and fisheries
productivity and impeded water flows. The need was recognized to restore water
circulation in the plavny (i.e. reed beds) and to undertake proactive management
measures to restore habitat productivity, such as controlled bums, grazing and mechanical
removal of the dense reed beds. The local communities had being used uncontrolled
small fires around the margins of plavny to decrease reed growth and maintain
productivity for grazing.
The project financed next activities:
* pilot reed harvesting and testing for commercial market;
* TOR developing for burning based on the results of the Scientific Program and
getting the government permission to burn, a pilot burning was begun;
* reducing the grazing pressure on Yermakov Island;
* a canal along the Vilkovo-Primorskoye road was dug;
- a siphon underneath the Danube-Sasyk canal and culverts underneath the Vilkovo-
Primorskoye road were cleared.
The first undertaken steps toward implementation of the management plan for SZP
area improved the ecological situation in some parts of its territory.
The Danube Plavny Authority's approach to working with local user groups to gain
consensus on management of DBR, along with the environmental education and NGO
training/small grants program, improved relations with local villagers and gained more
support for the biosphere reserve's mission.
Objective D.1.(d)   The coordination of the project with the GEF Romania Danube
Delta Biodiversity Project was made through the following activities:
* a few field visits by Romanian representatives to DBR and Ukrainian ones to
Romania;
* Ukrainian participation in annual technical meetings held by Romanian Danube Delta
Biosphere Reserve Authorities;
* regular exchange of scientific and other information. The project fostered modest
cooperation, especially on technical exchanges. Joint studies were carried out on



sturgeons and their protection, in bird monitoring and vegetation mapping the Danube
Delta;
* Ukrainian wardens training was held in Romania and Romanian wardens training
was held in Ukraine;
*  cooperation with Romania Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (bilateral Romanian-
Ukrainian transboundary biosphere reserve was established);
* cooperation with NGOs and other organizations.
D.2. GEF Objectives
Objective D.2.1.(a) Given the isolation and neglect of the DP and the Ukrainian
Danube Delta, and the very limited attention that it had received from the international
community and from Ukrainian authorities by the beginning of the project, support from
the GEF was of particular benefit. It has increased international understanding of the
ecological process of the Ukrainian portion of the Danube Delta. Most important, by
strengthening and reorienting the DPA the project has helped to introduce public support
for the effective sustainable protected area management that was necessary to conserve
the biodiversity of this key part of the delta. It has been established appropriate planning
for sustainable resource use in the areas surrounding the core zone of DBR, conserving
and restoring breeding grounds for delta wildlife.
The bilateral Romanian-Ukrainian transboundary biosphere reserve will be
serving as a further catalyst for improvement management of the Danube Delta and
good background for the sustainable management of the Danube River basin and the
adjoining part of the Black Sea.
Objective D.2.1(b) During implementation of the project the Cabinet of Ministers of
Ukraine adopted the decision "On Strategy of Biodiversity Conservation". That means
that biodiversity was recognized to be one of priorities of the "Trends of State Ecological
Policy of Ukraine in the sphere of environment protection, use of natural resources and
provision of ecological safety", which were approved by the Verhovna Rada (i.e.
Parliament) of Ukraine on March 5, 1998. Among others there are "The Main Lines of
Activity in Biodiversity Conservation", namely: conservation of coastal, marine, river,
wetland, lake and marshland, meadow and steppe, woodland, and highland ecosystems;
ecological of agricultural landscapes and other territories of intensive economic activity;
conservation of species and populations; creation of a national ecological network. An
Operational Plan for Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve has been prepared, the main
components of which will be financed by the National Academy of Sciences.
Objective D2.1. (c) Within the framework of other donor-funded regional projects the
following activities which are closely link to the "Danube Delta Biodiversity Project"
occurred: a center for Biodiversity Conservation has been created; National reports on



State of Biodiversity Conservation Programs have been prepared and published; a draft of
an Intemational Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, a report
entitled Wetland Conservation in Black Sea Region of Ukraine and Action Plan have
been prepared, coordinated Action Plans for Conservation and Protection of Black Sea
Biodiversity have been prepared.
E.   Project Performance
E.1. The performance of the project met certain difficulties. The following ones can
be noted:
* the project financed the construction of headquarters building for the Danube Plavny
Authority, a contract for which was originally awarded to a private sector
construction firm. The lack of experience by both the construction contractor and the
government institutes traditionally responsible for construction, the enormous
changing the local construction material prices during project implementation,
contributed to costly delays in construction. The headquarters building activity was
completed two years later than planned. The delay slowed the completion of certain
components, and to some extent diluted attention that could have been devoted to
wetlands management activities late in the project;
* in the final year of the project it was identified the necessity of licensing the use of
foreign bank accounts and on-going involvement of the National Bank in it. As a
result of substantial delays in obtaining the National Bank's license for the operation
of the Special Account, disbursement was interrupted and the completion of project
activities was slowed for a few months;
*  the project was implemented in a period of severe national problems, with cuts in
budgetary support for most state institutions, including the National Academy of
Sciences. The reserve staff usually received their salaries from one to four months
late;
* transition of Ukraine to a market economy. It caused the problems in procurement at
the beginning the project, in spending funds and disbursing. Pertaining to the project
implementation laws and regulations changed quite frequently (sometimes within a
year);
* substantial inflation in Ukraine during the implementation period and financial
difficulties;
* the project's modest accomplishments in the restoration of Stensovsko-Zhebrianski
Plavny were influenced by a delay in establishment of the biosphere reserve and by
the time needed to develop consensus among Ukrainian stakeholders on how to best
manage this site.



E.2.  A few positive factors that affected the project were:
* experience with implementation of the GEF Transcarpathian Biodiversity Protection
Project ( it was the same project implementation unit - InterEcoCentre), that had been
under implementation for one year when the Danube Delta Biodiversity Project was
launched;
* international interest to the project. From the outset of implementation, there was
strong interest of some international organizations in forning partnerships with the
MEPNS and Danube Plavny Authority on implementation of the project. One of
these partners was the Dutch RIZA, which provides technical assistance in water
resources management and wetlands conservation worldwide, with special emphasis
on improving the management of delta ecosystems. The project's cooperation with
RIZA spanned the project implementation period, and is planned to continue in the
operational phase;
* fruitful, coordinated and efficient work of the Word Bank, MEPNS and
InterEcoCentre. The World Bank's staff should be highly praised for their excellent
work, mutual understanding and assistance . Understanding and assistance of the
World bank disbursement division helped to overcome all the financial difficulties.
There have been many people and organization, including ministries, NGOs,
scientific institution, universities and commercial enterprises who have helped to get
down this road. However the key factor was the involvement of the local population.
F.   Monitoring and Evaluation
The World Bank carried out on a regular basis the monitoring and evaluation of
the project performance. The MEPNS permanently controlled and supervised the process
of the implementation of the project. There has been tight cooperation with all branches
of authority.
G.   Key Lessons Learned and Impact
The Project was the second the World Bank and GEF project, following the
earlier "Transcarpathian Biodiversity Protection Project". The "Danube Delta
Biodiversity Project" was extremely important in promoting a positive image of
Ukraine among international organizations; it laid a good foundation for further
international environmental activities and participation of new financial institutions
interested in supporting various projects in environmental protection and conservation.
Because of the enthusiasm and efforts of hundreds of people, all obstacles and
difficulties were overcome, and the Project has been brought to its successful
completion.
The "Danube Delta Biodiversity Project" belongs to the 387 projects
recommended for registration by the International Selection Commission to participate in
the EXPO-2000 Program "Projects all over the World", Germany.



The implementation of the Project greatly influenced reserve's activities and the social
and ecological situation in the region, in particular:
* the aim of reserve's activities has changed - it shifted from "nature protection" toward
nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources, involving all the strata of
the local population;
* new data on biodiversity of the region were obtained; conservation methods and
approaches were revised and re-evaluated; management plans for conservation
biodiversity and sustainable use of natural resources have been set up;
* DBR has become a leader in forming the policy of using natural resources in the
region;
* a better warden service resulted in better nature protection due to the new staff
recruitment policy, warden training courses (including training abroad), and the
modem facilities and equipment now available to DBR's wardens.
* the awareness level of the local population and authorities has risen, especially in
issues related to biodiversity conservation; this resulted in a wider and better support
to DBR's actions concerning nature conservation.
* The small-size grants program extremely stimulated environmental activities of
NGOs, local communities and individuals in the region
- Preconditions were created for development of ecotourism in DBR.
The project had a positive impact to:
* MEPNS through training staff, learning new approaches to participatory protected
area management and sustainable resource use, familiarizing staff with progressive
international experience in nature protection;
* scientists through participation in training, workshops, conferences, symposiums;
* NGOs through training, strengthening capability, participation in the small grants
program, workshops;
* InterEcoCentre through training, strengthening capability.
DBR enjoyed a wider support from local people, and a better understanding of the
tasks and functions of the reserve. The project will have further positive impact on social
and environmental development of the region through introduction and promotion of
ecotourism. Creation of DBR provided opportunities to manage natural protected areas in
a more efficient way, for conservation of unique natural complexes, for scientific research
and monitoring; it also gave an important impetus for region's sustainable development.



It is necessary to emphasize the role of the Central Board of National Nature Parks and
Reserve's Affairs, the Danube Biosphere Reserve, the InterEcoCenter, and, of course, the
World Bank in the Project. Now, with its completion, it is especially important to
disseminate the results obtained by scientist and conservationist, to continue the
activities in the operational phase, and to use received knowledge and experience for
other projects and in other nature conservation units and protected areas of Ukraine.
