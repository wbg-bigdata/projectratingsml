_10A AN IMMALUMMUR  REULITATIOK ETNINEERIif  CREDIT
1.          The  following memorandum  and  recommendation on a proposed
engineering credit to Angola for SDR 28.3 million  (US$ 37.7   million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity.   It would help to finance an
engineering technical assistance project. Part I of the present document
describes the country's policies and the Bank's assistance strategy.  It
draws upon the latest Country Brief for Angola, which was distributed to the
Executive Directors in January 1991, as well as an Introductory Economic
Review (Report No. 7283-ANG) which was distributed to the Executive Directors
in June 1990.   Part II describes the credit, the rationale for IDA
involvement, project objectives, agreements reached and the risks of the
operation.
PAR? I - COUNTRY POLICIES AND UANR GROUP ASSISTANCE STRA5DGY
Backaround
2.          Angola, with a population of about 10 million, growing at an
annual rate of about 2.8 perceAt, is one of the richest countries in Africa
in terms of natural resource endowment (e.g., oil, diamoads, and fertile
land). At the same time, its economy is one of the most distorted of the
continent.- Since independence in 1975, the country has developed an economy
highly dependent on income from oil. Available statistics on Angola are poor
and should be treated with caution. GNP per capita, which is estimated at
US$620 in 1989, is closely linked to oil prices. The oil sector represents
about half of the GDP. In 1991, oil export earnings were about US$3 billion,
or about US$300 per capita. The oil industry, developed as an enclave, has
grown rapidly since 1975, and by early 1991, oil production reached about
460,000 barrels per day. By contrast, the non-oil sector's performance has
been poor since independence. It is estimated that non-oil sector's output
growth per capita has been negative since the early 1980's. Angola, which
was an important net exporter of agricultural products before independence,
has in recent years been increasingly dependent on food imports (and food
aid) to supply its urban population. The capacity utilization of existing
and the development of new manufacturing industries has been severely
affected by the lack of inputs, spare parts and maintenance services, as well
as by a distorted policy environment.
S.          The Government's failure to revive the economy after independence
is largely explained by three factorsi (i) a fifteen-year old civil war,
which has made much of the countryside too insecure for agricultural
production and transport, has required heavy military expenditures
(contributing to chronically large fiscal deficits, despite substantial
revenues from oil), and has destroyed a substantial part of the economic and
social infrastructures (ii) unusually severe hbman resource constraints, due



-2-
to the massive exodus of Portuguese settlers at independence; and (iii)
misguided economic policies which have created a highly distorted system with
a formal economy (largely public) managed by administrative controls, and a
large parallel economy (mostly private).
Ebconomic. Financial and Social Performance
4.   Since independence, the Angolan economy has been ravaged by a long and
costly civil war and by severe distortions commonly observed in centrally-
planned economies. The fall of domestic production and agricultural exports
that occurred after independence was primarily caused by the destruction of
the country's stock of human and physical capital, and aggravated by
macroeconomic policies which favored consumption.  In response to adverse
domestic conditions and external shocks which reduced the country's
resources, the Government resorted to rigid price controls and a system of
administratively allocated foreign exchange, instead of appropriate price
policies (exchange rate adjustments, corrections in relative prices) and
fiscal adjustments. An expansionary monetary policy maintained the level of
domestic consumption, mostly in the urban areas, at the expense of
investments to Increase the productive base of the economy.
5.          In many cases, official prices have not been changed since
independence, and the few price adjustments which have taken place have been
very modest when compared with increases in the nominal purchasing power of
the population. As a consequence of these pricing policies, the domestic
production of many goods has been discouraged, relative prices have been
severely distorted, waste in the consumption of some goods has been
stimulated, and wide gaps have appeared between the demand and the supply of
practically all goods and services. The exchange rate, which has been pegged
to the US$. was unchanged at 29.92 Kx per USS between 1975 and March 1991,
when it was adjusted to 60.00 NKx per US$.  Exchange rates prevailing in the
parallel market have, however, sometimes been as high as a hundred times the
6fficial rate. In the absence of adequate adjustments, the exchange rate
became overvalued and excess demand for foreign exchange was curtailed
through administrative controls.  As a result of these nolicies and the
hostilities, investment in the non-oil sector droppel substantially,
traditional agricultural exports practically disappeared, non-oil domestic
output per capita declined, and the country became almost exclusively
dependent on oil and diamond exports for its foreign exchange earnings.
la.o        To compensate for the shrinking d-m      "'ic fnon-oil) production per
capita, growing imports financed by oil income supplied the country with
consumption goods.   Government policies encouraged consumption through
widespread consumer price subsidies, the accumulation of sizeable fiscal
deficits and a system of remuneration 'in kind" to Government personnel.
More specifically, to protect the purchasing power of workers in the formal
sector, particularly civil servants, the Government introduced a system of
'buying rightss in official shops (supplied with imported consumer goods) in
partial lieu of cash payments of wages. Through this system, a relatively
small portion of the population has access to the bulk of the country's
imported consumer goods, at prices that are substantially below those
prevailing in the parallel market. Government employees, in turn, trade part
of these goods in the parallel market for food and consumption goods which
are  unavailable  in  official  shops  (e.g.,  vegetables,  fish,  etc).



- 3 -
Manufacturing enterprises also sell part of their producrion at low prices to
their own ewployees, who also trade on the parallel narket.
7.          Lack of financial discipline is a serious problem at all levels
of public administration and enterprises.  A growing part of the formal
economy has been financed through oil revenues, which in recent years have
provided over 80 percent of government income. In spite of the rapid growth
of oil revenues since 1986, the budget has consistently been in deficit as
non-oil revenue declined continuously, while expenditures remained at high
levels.  A large share of government expenditure, including most of the
military expenditure, is outside the budget. It is estimated that military
expenditures represer.' about 25 percent of GDP.  In 1988-90, the overall
budget deficit (including extra budgetary expenditure) was on average
equivalent to about one quarter of GDP at official   ices.  However, the
underlying deficit valued at more realistic prices i   stimated to be lower
(about 12 percent).
8.          Throughout  the  post-independence  period,  an  accommodating
monetary policy fully monetized the country's sizeable fiscal deficits. As
a result, a growing excess liquidity rapidly emerged but its inflationary
lmpact did not show up in the official price indices because of the
administratively controlled official prices.   These policies led to the
emergence of widespread parallel marketss price differentials between the
official and parallel markets rapidly attained 2,0002 to 10,0002. This, in
turn, reinforced the existing incentives to divert resources from the
official to the parallel economy. Money substitutes (such as imported beer)
and barter took On an increasing role in internal trade, further complicating
the management of monetary policy. Annual inflation in the parallel market
is estimated to have reached three-digit levels during 1987-90.
9.          Foreign and domestic trade have been hampered by rigid and
pervasive Government regulations and restrictions. There is a predominance
of inefficient public enterprises, not only in manufacturing, but also in
foreign trade, wholesaling, and in the retail network. Although there are
some private ent, -rises, their role in providing competition to the public
sector is weak, because of the administrative allocation of imports and fixed
profit margins imposed by the Government. Agricultural production has been
particularly affected by the war, the shortcomings of the trade system, and
the disappearance of bush traders. In the earlier period of its economic
history, when the country was not engulfed in armed conflicts, bush traders
had played an important role in the marketing and distribution system by
pro-iding consumer goods in exchange for agricultural products.
10.         Angola's external debt at end-1989 is estimated at over US$7
billion (including US$1 billion in interest arrears), of which about US$3.5
billion was owed to the Soviet Union, US$2.8 billion to Paris Club and other
Western creditors (mainly Brazil and Portugal), and the remainder to Eastern
European countries and Cuba. External debt represents about 100 percent of
GDP.  About one-third of the total debt is military.  In June 1989. the
Soviet Union rescheduled its loans on favorable terms (10 yeaz.s and 3
percent), including arrears and maturities falling due through 1990. In July
1989, the Paris Club rescheduled almost US$0.5 billion in arrears and
maturities falling due through September 1990; the other Western creditors
rescheduled their own debt on the same terms, The remaining maturity profile



- 4 -
is unfa:orable, with payments bunched over the period 1991-93.   Thus,
scheduled debt service would absorb about one-third of projected exports of
goods and services in 1991-93.    Assuming further Soviet rescheduling at
terms comparable to those of 1989, and "Toronto terms" for Western creditors,
overall debt-servicing capacity of the existing debt could be sufficient to
handle the flow of debt-service payments in the medium term, without
compromising the long-term debt profile of the country. However, the problem
of arrsars will in itself require an orderly resolution. Given the above,
Angola's capacity to service additional debt at non-concessional terms is
very limited.
11.         The social conditions prevailing in Angola are poor by African
standards.   This is the combined result of the civil war, inappropriate
policies, rapid migration to the cities and emigration of skilled manpower.
Life expectancy at birth has been estimated at 44 years, the izifant mortality
rate is 288 per thousand, less than 30 percent of the population has access
to health services and safe water, and despite the Government's achievements
in the field of education, the adult literacy rate is still 41 percent.
Disparity in social conditions among various regions are substantial, as a
result of the war-induced destruction. Poverty in the rural areas is acute.
In addition to the stagnation in economic activity, the main contributing
factors for rural poverty are: the interruption of normal links to the cities
, the drastic decline of inter-regional trade, lack of incentive goods, and
the lack of access to social services.
12.         These  factors particularly  affect women,  considering  their
predominant involvement in agricultural activities, and their greater
relative need for social services. Nevertheless, womelln access to basic
educational opportunities has been expanded and the current level of literacy
among women, although still low at 33 percent, is substantially higher than
in earlier years.   Also, the Government has adopted a more meritocratic
approach to the assignment of responsibilities by gender than is the case in
most other Sub-Saharan African countries. Vomen figure prominently in the
civil service, including in high-level positions.
Atteunts at Econoic Reform
13.         Recognizing that Angola's economic distortions and imbalances are
due in large part to inapDropriate economic policies, the Government
announced in 1987 an ambitious program of Economic and Financial
Restructuring (SEP). The basic objectives of the program were to stabilize
the economy and Improve production incentives by adjusting price levels
(including the exchange rate) in the formal economy. The proposed reforms,
had they been implemented, would have constituted a major departure from the
way the economy had been managed and included: Ci) a limited adjustment of
the exchange rate, which would have still left a wide margin between the
official and the parallel exchange rates; (ii) a reduction in the budget
deficit, and a corresponding reduction in inflationary financing; (iii) a
program for restructuring public enterprises through divesture and
liquidation; (iv) reform of the financial sector by encouraging the
establishment of comuercial banks and ensuring greater availability of credit
to the private sector; and (v) limiting price controls to only selected
essential goods.



v 5 -
14.         Whlile ths overall direction of proposed reforms was appropriate,
the measures generally did not go far enough to address the main structural
distortions, notably in the area of the exchange rate. In any event, with
the exception of a more accommodating attitude towards parallel market
activities, there has been little progress to date in implementing the
program. Since 1988, several laws were audpted that attempted to provide a
broad framework for structural refonm, but most of them have not been
applied. A new package of measures, including a 100 percent devaluation,
combined with wage increases and price liberalization was announced in early
1990 as part of a New Action Plan. The exchange rate adjustment, however,
was postponed for over a year and the decontrol of most prices is yet to be
implemented.
15.         A recent 'currency reform' in September 1990 (creation of a new
currency aid tight limits on convertibility from the old currency)
temporarily brought down the prices on the pArallel market. Hovever, this
attempt to reduce excess liquidity proved unsustainable. The experience with
this 'reform" further undermined the public's already shaky confidence in the
Government's management of the economy. Inflation is accelerating and the
gap between official and parallel exchange rates is widening to the range
which existed prior to the 'currency reform". Yet another attempt to put
forth a more consistent and comprehensive set of stabilization measures was
made recently as part of the annual plan for 1991. While reaffirming the
Government's coumitment to adjustment and reform, this plan still does not
represent the kind of comprehensive and credible package of reforms which
would be needed to address the fundamental economic distortions of the
Angolan economy. For example, the 100 percent devaluation implemented in
Marrch 1991, is insufficient to address the substantial overvaluation of the
New Kwanza.
16.         The absence of concrete and coherent economic reform measures to
date may be attributed to various factors, including3 (i) the Government's
preoccupation with the war and, more recently, with an intensifying peace
process (see paras. 18 and 19); (ti) the strong vested interests in the
existing system; (iii) the uncertainty with regard to the political impact of
reforms; and (iv) weaknesses in economic management, especlally the limited
capacity for designing and executing detailed action programs within a
consistent macroeconomic framework, and the inadequate coordination between
the principal actors in the policy making process.
17.         A table summarizing Angola's economic performAnce since 1986 is
presented below.   As has already been noted, however,  it is based on
statistical information whose accuracy is suspect. After decades of warfare,
it is highly likely, for instance, that the data for the non-oil sector is
misleadingly high.   Strengthening the statistical bass is one of the
objectives of the Economic Management and Capacity Building Project presented
to the Board on June 19, 1991.

Recent Political Dewelogments
2..          War, be it to seek independence from Portugal or between the
Government and UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola) in
the post-independence period, has been the dominant fact of life in Angola
for decades.   The Governmmnt has, in March 1991, opened the door for a
multiparty system through a revision of the constitution. In May 1991, a
cease-fire between MPLA (People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola - the
Government party) and UNITA forces was initialled, and so far, respected.
The cease-fire is part of a comprehensive agreement setting up a detailed
timetable for the integration of the two armies into a national Angolan army,
for the opening of the political system, and for the organization of
multiparty elections at all levels of government before the end of 1992. The
implementation of both the military and political aspects of the agreement
would be monitored by a "Political-Military Coomission' comprising, besides



- 7 -
the Government and UNITA, representatives from Portugal (which acted as
mediator) and the US and the Soi.&et Untion (both acted as observers).  It
would be assisted by a United Nations force of about 600. Signature of the
peace agreement was finalized on May 31, 1991.
19.         These developments clearly constitute a major breakthrough.  For
the first tina since independence, an end to the civil war is clearly at
hand.   Tf successful, this process would also significantly improve the
prospects for better economic management, including the reallocation of a
large amount of public resources from the mi1Ltary to development uses. Over
the short term, a number of remaining military and political issues will have
to be solved.   Among these, the orderly demobilization of about 150,000
soldiers from both armies is likely to constitute a major challenge.
Central Develonment Issues and Prosnects
20.         The medium-term economic prospects of Angola depend on five
factors. First, the conclusion of the civil war, which, in addition to the
heavy human cost, absorbs large amounts of financial resources and interferes
with economic activity.   Second, the speed and determination with which
economic policy reforms are undertaken, is crucial to restoring confidence in
the  government's  ability  to manage  the  economy.    Third,  the urgent
rehabilitation of the economic and social infrastructure, which has been
heavily damaged by decades of war.   Fourth, there is a need to get the
economy -- especially its non-oil productive sectors (e.g., agriculture) back
on its feet. And finally, there is a need to overcome the constraints on
longer-term development imposed by the shortage of skilled personnel and by
environmental degradation. With peace and an appropriate policy environment,
Angola has considerable growth potential in the medium term, in view of its
abundant natural resource endowment.
21.         There is still, however,  considerable uncertainty about the
prospects for economic recovery in the short term. Even if the war comes to
an end, it will likely take some time before the countryside is secure and
.hero 4t wn affective transition to a peacetime economv.  In addition, during
the 18 months pre-electoral period which is expected to follow the formal
ceasefire, the prospect that the GoverAment will be able to concentrate on
improving economic management is uncertain. The end of the war may also not
result in lmmediate savings of resources; demobilization will take time, the
integration of the Government and UNITA forces into a national army may
require additional spending, and there are substantial costs associated with
the resettlement of displaced people.   Moreover, while there are large
benefits to be gained from the rehabilitation of Infrastructure, realizing
them will take time and require large investments.  Finally, despite the
Government's renewed commitment to economic reform, weak economic management
is a  serious constraint.    Therefore,  capacity building &ad technical
assistance .. of the sort the proposed project would provide -- will be
crucial in strengthening policy formulation and implementation.
22.         In view of these uncertainties and the Bank's limited country
knowledge at this stage, growth prospects and external resource requirements
are difficult to assess with any degree of accuracy. However, given the
e=pected substantial reconstruction needs and skilled manpower constraints,
it is clear that international assistance will be crucial during the post war



- 8 -
reconstruction phase.   This asslstance would have to consist mainly of
economic pollcy advice, technical assLstance in general and pre-investment
studies In particular, and financial aid for infrastructure rehabilitation
and development, as wvll as for facilitating the transition to a peacetime
economy.
Iank  Groun Countrr Assistance Stratezi and Onerations
23.         Angola joined the Bank Group in September 1989 and the proposed
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Engineering Project would be the second
operation in the country. The relationship between the Pank and Angola is,
therefore, still at an incipient state, and has not yet reached the scope and
intensity that is rrevalent in the case of long-standing members of the
institution. The Bank's first strategic priority is, therefore, to further
nurture this relatlonship over the coming months by broadening the dialogue
on the country's development needs with the Angolan authorities and the non-
governmental sectors through lending operations, economic and sector work,
and aid coordination. As contact between the Bank Group and Angola expands,
confidence will grow and the dialogue can mature into the type of partnership
typical of other Borrowers.
24.         A broader dialogue would pave the way for the Bank to pursue the
objective of promoting economlc growth with equity in Angola. To achieve
these objectlves, the Bank would follow an assistance strategy based on: (i)
building capacity in economlc management and helping prepare pre-investment
studies; (ii) facilitating the transition to a peacetime economy; (iii)
helping rehabilitate the devastated economLc and social infrastructure; and
(iv) supporting the process of economic reform by helping in the design and
implementation of macroeconomic and sector policies needed to stabilize the
economy and restore production incentives. The Bank vould use considerable
flexibility in desigaLng lts lending and economic and sector work programs in
Angola, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the economic and political
sltuation in the country. The volume of lending and the number of operations
will depend on the Government's progress in implementing the needed economic
policy reforms, on the restoration of peace, securlty and political
stability, and on the ability of the country to effectively absorb Bank
assistance.
25.         Lend4na Strate&v.  The lending program for the period FY91-93
comprises an average of two operatlons per year.  The lending strategy
revolves around three elements.  The inltial focus will be on technical
assistance and pre-investment operations.  Subsequently, the program would
expand to high-priority rehabilitation and investment projects, particularly
in Infrastructure and the social sectors.  Eventually, if the Government
implements appropriate policy reforms, the Bank would also consider
adjustment lending, lf the country needs quick-disbursement assLstance.
26.         The first two operations in the Angola lending program would
provide technical assistance, training and engineering services.   They
include the Economic Management Capacity Building project already approved
and the proposed Infrastructure Engineering project to provide assistance in
formulating policies, strategies and detailed pre-investment studies for the
rehabilitation of key transport and urban infrastructure systems. Technlcal
assistance components are also included in other proposed projects, notably



support to Improve planning and Implementation capacity In the social
sectors.
27.         The second element of the Bank's lending strategy involves
assistance for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the economic and social
infrastructure and development of the productive sectors.   Building on
experience to be gained with the planned social sector rehabilitation project
and proposed sector work in education and related fields, several operations
focussing on human resource development (especially of women) will be
considered. Rehabilitation projects are being prepared in the urban, energy
and transport sectors, where the need for immediate rehabilitation can be
clearly  identified.      This  includes  improvement  of  essential  urban
infrastructure  (e.g.,  water,   sanitation  and  solid  waste)   in  the
Lobito/Benguela area to reduce severe public health hazards, and to ensure
the viability of other Lobito corridor investments. Based on the completed
energy assessment and a follow-up review of the power sector investment
program, a proposed operation in the energy sector would help to rehabilitate
high priority power infrastructure and support the financial rehabilitation
of the power utilities.   In transport,  in addition to the pipeline of
investment projects which would emerge from this operation, the Bank would
focus on the Lobito/Benguela rail corridor by rehabilitating present corridor
infrastructure to enable the system to handle medium-term transit and
national traffic demand, and establish the basis for future upgrading and
expansion of the network.
28.         The third element of the Bank's lending strategy consists of
financial support, if needed, for the Government's economic adjustment
program, once the authorities have demonstrated a clear commitment to
comprehensive reforms by making sufficient progress in adopting key policy
measures.
29.         Performance MonitorinA.  The size of the Investment operations,
as well as the speed at which they could be processed would depend on the
evolving security situation, and on the Government's progress in adopting
sectoral reforms and improving implementation capacity. lhen the incentive
framework in the productive sectors improves, the Bank would undertake
catalytic investments in these sectors through Industrial restructuring and
agricultural rehabilitation operations. Greater security in the rural areas
wvould be an essential condition for agricultural operations, including
protection of the environment. Government performance in implementing the
Economic Management Capacity Building project would also be an element taken
into account to determine the size and composition of future lending.
Performance in macroeconomic management will be evaluated with respect to
actions designed to correct the overvaluation of the exchange rate,
liberalize prices, stabilize public finances, improve production incentives,
and disengage the State from productive and commercial activities.   The
volume of eventual quick-disbursing assistance would depend on the country's
financing requirements, which would themselves be highly dependent on the
evolution of the price of oil.
30.         Economic and Sector Work.  The key objectives of the economic and
sector work program are to support the policy dialogue with the Government
and to provide the intellectual underpinnings for the Bank's lending
operations. As executing agency for UNDP, the Bank undertook, in 1989-90, an



- 10 -
Introductory Economic Review of Angola and an Energy Assessment. Following
the completion of these reports, the Bank's economic work has focussed on
selected issues of economic reform, which has provided an input to the
Economic Management Capacity Building Project.   A major report on Trade,
Pric~e, and Wage Reform has been discussed with the Government in March 1991,
and will be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly. In the future.
the Bank plans to deepen its macroeconomic dialogue (including through joint
missions with the IMF) by initiating reviews of public expenditure and of
public enterprises. Sector work will focus on acquiring and broadening the
Bank's sector knowledge (in the productive and social sectors), thus
contributing to an expanding lending program and dialogue on sectoral policy
issues.
31.         Donor Coordination and Relations with the IMF.  Many donors have
been providing assistance to Angola for some time. As the Bank builds up its
presence in Angola, however, it can be expected to play a coordinating role
because of its multisectoral experience, as well as the overview provided by
its economic and sector work. In parallel with the potential build-up of the
lending program and the deepening of the understanding of Angola's economy,
the Bank also plans to intensify its aid coordination efforts. One of the
objectives of the Economic Management Capacity Building Project is to help
coordinate, where necessary, the various donor efforts in certain key areas
of technical assistance. A central concern of this coordination effort is to
avoid duplication of technical assistance activities. The Bank has also been
coordinating closely with the IMF in carrying out its initial policy dialogue
with the Government, and with the UNDP and bilateral donors in preparing the
components of the capacity building project.
32.         Summary Assessment. Angola has made little progress in realizing
its considerable development potential because of: (i) a destructive, costly,
and-protracted civil war; (ii) a severe lack of skilled personnel, and (iii)
misguided policies and weak economic management, as well as an inadequate
legal and regulatory framework. The Bank's strategy is to *spring open" a
relationship with this new member by engaging the authorities in a dialogue
on the country's development needs, supporting capacity building, helping to
rehabilitate the devastated economic and social infrastructure, facilitating
the transition to a peacetime economy, and supporting the process of economic
reform. The pace and scope of the Bank's assistance program will depend on
Angola's progress towards peace and security, implementation of economic
reforms and improvements in absorptive capacity. The initial focus wil.l be
on an active economic and sector work program and technical assistance
lending operations focussing on capacity building, notably in economic
management, and preparation of pre-investment studies.   If the security
situation  improves  significantly,  a  wider  range  of  activities  in
infrastructure rehabilitation would be supported. If the Government improves
the incentive framework in the productive sectors, the Bank would expand its
operations and bring forward investments in sectors such as agriculture and
industry. Finally, the Bank would consider adjustment lending, depending on
the progress in implementing comprehensive macroeconomic policy reforms as
well as on the country's financing requirements, which would largely hinge on
the price of oil.

PART 11 - MEE CREDI
33.         A recent economic review of Angola (Report No. 8906-ANG of June
29. 1990) has defined the actions and priorities for the economic recovery of
Angola. Studies by the Southern Africa Transport and Telecoummnications
Commission (SATTC) have further identified the problems of the transport
infrastructure sector. The need for rehabilitation of the infrastructure
sector is one of the main areas of concern. The task would require long lead
times and careful preparation of the necessary actions. The proposed credit
supports the objectives of the country strategy and the Economic Management
Capacity Building Technical Assistance Credit (Report No. P-5525-ANG)
recently approved by the Executive Directors, by addressing the need to
formulate within the infrastructure sector, a Priority Investment Program
(PIP), and enabling sector institutions to participate in Public Expenditure
Reviews (PER).
34.         The infrastructure sector is one of the major casualties of the
long lasting civil strife and economic mismanagement of Angola. The lack of
adequate funding for the maintenance, rehabilitation and expansion of
existing facilities led to deterioration of the infrastructure. Controlled
prices, absence of effective cost recovery and unclear institutional
responsibilities resulting in loss of local technical and managerial capacity
made the situation worse. Decay and decapitalization are widespread in the
sector. Inadequacies in infrastructure have become a major bottleneck to the
development of Angola's economy and to improvements in the quality of daily
life. Thus, it is urgent to restore capacity and to build a pipeline of
projects aimed at the rehabilitation and cost effective operation of the
infrastructure sector in Angola.
35.         $ The.. adequacy. and,reliability of Angola's basic infrastructure,
such as highways, ports, railways, and that of major population centers like
the capital city of Luanda, are fundamental to the country's economic
recovery. Before independence in 1975, Angola's transport and urban
infrastructure supported and fostered the development of significant
agricultural production and processing, and other industrial and comercial
activity. An example of good construction and maintenance before the onset
of the civil war is the continued existence of much of the basic
infrastructure in 1991, although it is deteriorating rapidly because of yeats
of low maintenance, war-related damage and severe overcrowding in major urban
centers  such as Luanda.    Deferred maintenance  is the  consequence  of
n-sufficLent institutional capacity coupled with minimal allocation of
physical and financial resources over the last 15 years.   Rehabilitation
rather than outright reconstruction is still possible with a substantial cost
advantage.    The  country  needs  lmmediate  assistance  through  sizable
rehabilitation investments, organizational restructuring, human resource
development, management and operations improvement, and other related inputs.
36.          The severe problems of Angola's infrastructure sector are not
related solely to the lack of investments, equipment and spare parts, or
institutional capacity. The macroeconomic and sector policLes in force in
Angola since independence have aggravated the difficulties. The over-valued
local currency, for instance, cheapens imports, depresses exports, and
creates a scarcity of foreign exchange.  Demand for foreign exchange far



- 12 -
exceeds its supply, leading to forced allocations which do not reflect real
economic priorities. This is one of the main reasons for the lack of spare
parts which,  In  the  long  term,  has  rendered  Inoperable  substantial
investments in equipment within the sector. Trucking companies have solved
this problem in part by entering the parallel market to obtain spares which
allow them to operate, also In the parallel market, so they can recuperate
their costs and turn a profit.
37.         The  lack  of  institutional capacity  requires  financing  of
technical assistance to prepare and program investments, study the policy
changes required and develop the necessary capacity. On-the-job training of
local staff, augmented by formal training on specific topics, also calls for
technical assistance and skills currently In short supply In Angola.
Ratlonale for IDA Involvement
38.         This project would be a key element in the Government's program
of economic and financial restructuring. IDA's involvement In its financing
would provide badly needed leadership in promoting Institutional reform,
Introducing cost recovery, strengthening infrastructure agencies, and
coordinating potential donor support to transport and urban rehabilitation.
As a result of IDA participation, the process of capacity building In the
form of institutional, manAgement and operational improvement and training
would support investment programming in the sector and would precede
rehabilitation.
Project Obsective
39.         The primary objective of the project would be to support the
economic recovery and further development of Angola infrastructure by mesans
of the -rehabilitation of key transport and urban systems, and assistance in
the formulation of policies, strategies, rehabilitation plans, and programs
of continuing maintenance.
Prolect Descriotion
40.         The project would consist of the following principal elements:
(1) economic and financial feasibility and basic engineering studies and
environmental assessments for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the
National Basic Hihway Network (1511), the Namibe Port Transport System
(MPTS), comprising the Port and the Mocamedes Railway, the Urban
Infrastrueture of the City of Luauda (UICL) and the tu:-n P*rt °    r^- --eport
System (LPTS), comprising the Port and the Railway; (2) final design and
preparation of tender documents for selected priority investments identified
in the above studies; (3) technical assistance for the Ministry of Planning
and Luanda Provincial Government (urban), the Ministry of Transport &
Communications (ports and railways) and the Ministry of Public Works and
Urban Development (highways); (4) human resource development and initial
training programs in critical categories for public and private sector
(contractors) personnel; (5) repair or replacement of some equipment elements
of the systems; and (6) provision of office and residential facilities,
including office equipment, vehicles, spare parts and supplies for
consultants and government agencies involved in the project. The project was
designed taking Into account lessons from experience under technical

asistece (TA) projects Ln Aftica as reported to the Boardlf.  (Detailed
description of project components is provided la the Technical Annex (Part
A)).
Ptoject Cost mod Timtbl
41.         Total estimated costs of the project would be US$42.5 million
equivalent, of which US$37.7 million would be In foreign exchange. Because
of the internal situation of Angola, a significant physical contingency
allowance has been included. The project cost sumary and the financing plan
are in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as
well as a disbursement schedule are In Schedule B. A time-table of key
project processing events ti In Schedulo C. A project Implementation plan Is
in the Technical Annex (Part B).
Aareeaments
42.         Conditions of effectiveness ares (1) execution by the Government
of implementation agreements setting outt (a) the specific ministries and
agencies responsible for execution of project components, (b) necessary
coordination mechnisms, and (c) countorpart  to be made available for work
and training on the projectl and (2) compltion of satisfactory arrangements
for project coordinatiog, Including the establishment of a project unit,
selection and controlling of Its key staff (Annex B-3), and a plan and
timetable for the provision of housing and offlies that project consultants
vould use. Section 3.3 of the Technical Annex on project execution gives
details of coordination and managerial aspocts. Project covenants include:
(1) preparation of an action plan to implement cost-based tariffo, deregulate
and privatize truasport; (2) formulation of an Investment program for the
infrastructure sector; (3) identification of initial policy, organisation and
funding mechaAisms necessary for the futuro development of the sector; and
(4) auditing, monitoring and reporting requirements; and (5) opening of a
project account in US$ for government contrlibution to project finances. At
a required mid-term review, no later than eighteon montha after credit
effectiveness and prior to further disbursementa, the Government and IDA will
evaluate and agreo ont (1) carrying-out ffnal designs based on completed
feasibility studiea, and (2) status of covenants above and identification of
additional steps required.
*,.         TX. need to establish full cost recovery in the infrastructure
sector is a crucial requirement for Its effective operation and maintenance.
This is reflected In all terms of refrence for the studies to be financed by
this operation. An action plan will addrses the deregulation of tariffs and
placement of all operations in the sector on firm comercial basis.
Training, capacity building, and Institutional development will improve the
performance of sector agencies. Development of an investment program for the
infrastrueture sector will follow. The rehabilitation investments prepared
under this project will correspond to a first time-slice of the investment

Development In Sub-Saharan Africa, April 1990.

program. The combined benefits of these undertakings are I (1) to contribute
to the cost effectiveness and control of public expenditure In the
Infrastructure sector; (2) to assist in the development of priorities in the
Infrastructure rehabilitation process; and (3) to initiate the restoration
and development of institutional capacity in the sector.
Risks
44.         Little coordination exists between Government agencies and state
enterprises  responsible  for  the  project  components.    This  lack  of
coordination and limited institutional capacity constitute the main source of
risk for the project. However, the project's infrastructure systems were
operational and relatively cost-effective until 1975.   They have the
potential to becom so again once the internal security situation improves.
Their future economic and flnancial viast lity depends upon flexibility in the
formulation and adoption of comprehensive rehabilitation strategies through
feasibility studies, technical assistance, and cost recovery policies. Staff
training, provision of basic equipment and support services will help Improve
the local capability for planning and execution, but donor coordination will
be required  during their  implementation.   Full attainment of project
objectives will depend on: (1) the pace of capacity development; (2) the
close supervision and follow-up of the project by IDA; and (3) the effective
management of tochnical assistance. The emphasis on technical assistance
(section A.2 of Technical Annex) and the implementation agreements, necessary
to the preparation and coordination of the rehabilitation program, will
greatly reduce project risks. The potential benefits outweigh the risks
discussed above.
Enviromeantal Aspeats
45.         All  project  components  have  provisions  for  carrying  out
onvironmental assessments of the rehabilitation works to be studied.  A
specialist working at the central coordiating office at the planning
dminstry will coordinate environmental aspects of the project. The project
will also finance the expertise necessary to review existing legal and
regulatory framewrk, and to propose modifications necessary to enhance the
legal foundations for future work in defense of the environment in Angola.
The actions to be studied under this project will have a positive
environmental impact (section B.2 of the Technical Annex).
Reccuiendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed credit.

SIl IMIRASRC?h  SECTOR
An Overview
?g'aneuort
1.          Angola's basic infrastructure has strong colonial
antecedents and is present configuration, though not its condition, is
essentially unchanged since independence. In 1975, the system had a
comprehensive modal mix which included rail, highway, air, cabotage and
shipping, and provided an excellent opportunity for potential transit
facilities to match or facilitate economic development. A distinctive,
lateral three rail-port corridor system -- north, central and southern -
- supported by feeder road networks dominated the modal pattern.
Additional highways provided very basic north-south provincial links, as
well as access to national borders. The air sector, which then linked
all key provincial cities, subsequently has become the only dependable
means of passenger and light freight transit over much of the country,
because of the security situation.
2.          In 1987, Angola's transport infrastructure comprised 75,000
km of roads, 2,500 km of railways, 3 international and 3 cabotage ports
and a hierarchy of 31 airports. An estimated 12,000 non-military trucks
and 400 buses, 40 locomotives, 11 long distance ships, 10 cabotage
vessels and 21 aircraft operated infrequent modal services at low levels
of efficiency. Rail and port systems form distinctive corridors, which
previously ran eastwards from Luanda to Malange (a distance of 430 km)
in the north, Lobito to Luau (1,350 km), a point close to the Zairian
border in the central heartland, and Namibe to Menongue (750 km) in the
south. Regions are linked to these corridors by 8,000 km of paved
highway and 67,000 km of secondary and feeder roads, which, together
with the air services, provide the main means of north-south travel.
Cabotage currently accounts for 180,000 tons of freight between the four
main ports and has potential for substantial growth. The Cabinda
enclave is dominated by the oil industry and the non-petroleum
infrastructure is small.
3.          Statistics on the system under the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MINTEC) show total freight traffic for 1986 amounting to
approximately 3 million tons, about three quarters of the volume for
1985, with the road and maritime sectors compensating to a limited
degree for the continuing decline In rail traffic. In 1987, the number
of passengers carried fell below 25 million, following a decline in bus
services which offset improvements in rail and air transit demand. The
total value of M1NTEC-controlled transport and communications services
in 1987 was an estimated Km 17,631 million, of which S12 came from road
services, 302 from air and the remainder divided fairly evenly among the
other modes and communications.
4.          Patterns of urban development in Angola since independence
have been determined mainly by the disruptive effects of the war.
Guerrilla warfare and economic sabotage, including the widespread use of
antipersonnel mines, have destabilized agricultural activities and



- 22 -
forced the rural population to seek safety in protected urban sites.
Rural urban migration in response to economic factors is thus heavily
distorted by these war-induced population movements. The urban
population has risen from an estimated 151 of the total population in
1970 to 23Z In 1985, although no recent censue dta are available at the
national level. However, most observers agree that urban population
growth has been rapid since 1974. This growth is particularly evident
in the capital city of Luanda, where the population has risen from
450,000 in 1975 to 1.3 million In 1985.
5.          The large influx of migrants has overburdened the capacity
of urban Infrastructure and public utility systems leading to a marked
decline in both service standards and service coverage. Lack of
managerial and technlcal cadres, limited equipment, and the precarious
financial condition of public utility companies have resulted in
deterioration of the systems inherited from the Portuguese In 1975.
These same factors, combined with rapid and unplanned urban settlement,
have caused service coverage to fall. With only limited investment
since inependeace and grossly lnadequate maintenance, the basic urban
services of water supply, sewage, sanitation, and refuse collection are
mow in a critical state. The vlrtual absence of any urban planning or
sites and services provision exacerbates this situation. Much of the
urban expansion since 1975 has consisted of a proliferation of self-
built housing In unplanned and largely unimproved communities
(musseques) on the fringes of the main urban centers.
6.          In sum, the infrastructure of Angola is In need of
rehabilitation, maintentace, and upgrading. Otherwis, it will become a
major bottleneck to economlc development.

DETAILE PROJECT T)j3RI?1ZQJj
PORT OF NAMIBE COMPONENT
CURRENT SIT_AT1ON
1.          The comercial port of Nsamibe is the third-ranking port of
Angola and the principal fishing harbor. It to located In the south-
eest corner of Baia do Namibe. The minerals and oil port of Sacomar
lies in the north-east corner. Sacomar port Is under the soame port
administration as Namibe. A Director General administers the Port of
Namibe assisted by managerial and technical officers in different
sections and departments. The port employs a staff of about 1,500
poople. The anchorage in Baia de Namibe is good, with easy approach
from the sea. Minimum depth in the approach is 10.5 a to the camercial
quay.
2.          The main port facilities include a total of 875 m gravity
wall stone quay with depths varying from 10.3 a for the deep sea traffic
to 6.0-3.0 m for coastal traffic and small local craft. Two cargo
shads, together 7,1200 m2, are situated behind the deep-sea wharf. Open
storage areas are available behind the coastal wharf and between the
sheds. The inland boundary of the port area iS, however, restricted by
a continuous sandstone cliff about 40 a high, virtually limiting the
width of the back-up areas.
3.          In .1990, Port of Nadibe handled 206,700 tons of general
cargo, mainly Imports (902), for the Namibe hinterland. Traffic
throughput of the port has been growing at about 7X a year, on average,
from 1980 to 1990. In 1973 the coastal traffic amounted to less than
202 of the total imort-export traffic. In 1988 and 1989 the share was
53 anGd dropped to 321 during iift. Container triffic hu. increased
from 8S in 1986 to 152 in 1990, equivalent to 27,200 tons of imported
cargo.  Containerisation has increased by almost 302 a year during the
post 5 years that the port has handled containers. This growth, in
turn, has caused substantial operational difficulties in the port.
4.          A major problem affectiag the quay operations Is the
settlement appearing on considerable portions of the apron surface,
particularly under the Lner rails of the shore cranes. Pavement on the
port roads and storage aroas has worn badly because of neglected
maintenance and beavy loads stemning from the icreased container
traffic.
5.          The cargo handling equipment ls old and has lacked proper
maintainanes. The management cited technical inadequacies, shortcomings
In the engineering department, and the lack of spare parts as main
causes of these problem. Equipment availability io currently less then
202. Due to this extremely low equipment availability the port does not
have enough equipment to handle the current traffic, particularly the



- 24 -                    Annex Al-aCt)
Page 2 of 6
increasing numbers of containers.  There is one ship-to-shore crane,
which can lift 22 tons, to handle containers at the quayside, but
settlement of the quay apron hampers Its perfotmance. The port has only
one container handling machine, which cean lift and transport the
containers from the quay to the yard, but this equipment Is now out of
operation and needs major rehabilitation. Fortunately, a private
trucking company in Namibe operates one 42-ton forklift truck, and the
port hires it to handle containers.
6.          Increased container traffic and shortage of equipment have
completely congested the port at the open storage areas. The container
dwell time is extremely high, more than 300 days, on average, for
Imports and exports. The port is holding more than 3,000 containers,
which is beyond its storage capacity, and containers are scattered
throughout the port wherever space can be found.
7.          With the exception of 1983, the port of Namibe has operated
at a nominal profit since independence. However, the positive net
operating income recorded may be misleading because depreciation does
not reflect the present value of assets. Additionally, few Investments
have gone into the port during the period, creating a rather run-down
impression in the port's Infrastructure and equipment. Besides, the
institution has not developed Its staff enough to ensure efficient
management of port operations, equipment, maintenance and further
expansion.
LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF PORT OF NANIBS
8.          The Namibe Transport System, comprising the ports of Namibe
and Sacomar. the Mloamedes Railway and the road from. Lubango to the
Angolan/Namibla border at St.Clara/Oshikango, is fundamental to the
development of Southern Angola or the Nsmibe hinterland. This region
includes the provinces of Namibe, Huila, Cunene and Cuando-Cubango, one-
third of the area of Angola with great potential for mining and
agriculture. The Namibe Transport System also offers a shorter, and
possibly more economical rail cum road route for imports and exports for
Northern Namibia. The northern section is the most densely populated
region of Namibia and offers a substantial potential for the development
of agriculture and agro-industries.
9.          The long terms goals and objectives of the port of Namibe
are (1) to optimize the use of existing facilities and (2) to develop
the port infrastructure, acquisitions and management to cater to
existing traffic as well as anticipated growth. The strategy to attain
these goals relies on increased productivity and cost effectiveness with
the generation of sufficient revenues to cover costs. Cost control also
is a major Input in evolving a competitive tariff vis-a-vis other
regional ports to sustain the market and lncreseo earnings.

IRE PROJECT CONPONENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
10.         The first step in achieving these objectives io to evolve a
long-term plan comprisang (1) investments for rehabilitation of existing
facilities and acquisition of new assets; (2) operations improvementst
organization restructuring; (3) introduction of a cost-based tariff
structure; (4) human resource development; and (5) systems improvements
through a development study. The study recomnendations would form the
basis for preparation, appraisal, and eventual approval of a port
rehabilitation and modernlzation project. The IRE project would include
technical assistance to improve port operations and equipment
maintenance and repairs and to train human resources. The project would
lay the basis for a more effective planning and  implementation of the
main rehabilitation and modernization program.
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
11.         The proposal for IRE for port of Namibe contains the
following components:
(1)   Study
A feasibility and basic engineering study with an environmental
assessment for the rehabilitation nd Wmaintonance of port of
Namibe. The study will define the minimum short-term measures --
maagerial, operational, investment -- onabling the port to
optimize the use of existing facilities. The study also will
explore how to create a commercially viable entity free from
reliance on Government support, and will propose development
options for the port'. infrastructure to bandle existing traffic
as well as anticipated growth for the period 1991-1995. The study
will furthor determine the feasibility and the optimm program of
investments In further upgrading and possibly expansion of the
port facilities up to the year 1004. The study will give special
emphasis to traffic forecasts, strategies, £wman resource
development as well a tariff structure, foreign exchange
requirement and allocation. The TOR for the port study is
combined with the required study for the Mocamedes railway in
order to prepare a development programme for the Nadibe Transport
system.
Estimated cost of the combined study for the railway and the port
is US$ 0.86 million inel. US$ 0.375 million for the port
component.
(2) Technical Assistance
Operations and maintenance shortcomings are evident in all port
activities. In some categories, particularly mechanical equipment,
the problems have become serious. Although lack of spare parts
and skilled staff is the main cause, the root problem appears to
lie in the institutional, administrative and managerial aspects of
port operations. Control and regulation, formulation of policies



- 26 -
Page 4 of 6
*nd objectives, organisational structures and planning mechanisms
are less effective than they would othemwis be. The Importance
of maintenane and Its costs reo not fully recognised. Budgets at
the goverment and port level have failed co provide sufflcient
funds to cover these costl, although this has resulted, in part,
from lack of accurate information on costs.  Furthermore excessive
control from government ministries $mpa$rs the port's ability to
manage its operational and maintoenaee functions   This is most
evident In the approval of purchase orders for spare or
replacement parts, where it very often takes soveral months, or
longer, before an order eventually can be placed. Technical
assistance Is necessary for port operations, equipment maintenance

within tbese departments and to introduce improved operational and

The port does not have enough sWkilled personnel for an enterprise
seeking to modernize its equipment and to Introduce new operating
techniques. The initial training will be on-the-job sossions
conducted by technical assistanco experts. The consultant for the
feasibility study will develop a detailed training plan, based on
the manlyiss of existing personnel propared by the port of Namibe
cooperating with the tochnlcal assistanc expetrts. The general
objective of the training plan would bet (1) to Improve the
__~p tc-les of staff who can benefit fos fnvrther training; (2)
to train new staff to either replace those who will retire or
ncrease the  lovel in accordance with port of NamLbe's development
plan for the concerned pteriod; and (3) to improve the management
and organization skills of managers and supervisors. The most
urgent training need will be implemented during the first phase of

14.         The Port of Namibe has currently exceeded the storage
capacity of containers because of the poor equipment availability and
the extremely high dwell time of more than 70 days for imported full
containers and 300 days for empties.
15.         High dwell time is expensive. Each additional day that a
full import container spends in the port costs the economy an estimated
USS 5, the capital cost of the goods, and another US$ 3-4 in demurrage
charges to the container owner (assuming the container is not returned
within 21 days of discharge): i.e. a total of US$ 8.50. With current
import volume of 2,250 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), and the
extremely high dwell time, this represents a cost to the Angolan economy
of US$ 1.4 million per  nnum.  More importantly in the long run, high
dwell time reduces the effective operation and capacity of the port.
Ship's waiting time and freight costs would both rise and, once the port
has reached full capacity, it would lose all additional traffic.
16.         It is anticipated that the IRE project will contribute to a
reduction of container dwell time by 502 over the project period of two
years, which would allow the port to receive increased container traffic
and reduce the annual cost to the Angolan economy from the US$ 700,000 a
year that it experiences now.
17.         A major benefit would also derive from the IRE project in
the reduction in the total number of ship berth days and the number of
days that ships spend waiting for a berth. Although the Angolan economy
will not receive immediately the full benefit of the savings in ship's
time, ultimately it will be passed on in the form of lower freight rates
and demurrage charges.

INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION ENGINEERING (IRE) PROJECT
CAMINHO DE FERRO DE KOCA_4EDES (CFRO COMPONENT
INTRODUCTION
1.          The Namibe Port Transport System, comprising the ports of Namibe and
Sacomar and the Mocamedes Railways (CFM), is fundamental to the development of
southern Angola or the Namibe hinterland including the provinces of Namibe,
Huila, Kunene and Ruando-Kubango. This area is about a third of the country and,
has deposits of many minerals and stones such as copper, lead, zinc, marble,
granite and kaolin. The area also offers great potential for (1) development of
agriculture, (2) establishment of agro-industries, and (3) export of agricultural
products to other regions of Angola and overseas.
DESCRIPTION OF 1THE NETWORK
2.          CFM has a total route length of 907 km of which 756 km comprises the
main line between Namibe and Menongue. Construction of the 756 km long main line
commenced in 1905 and was finally completed, along with the branch line from
Lubango to Chiange, in 1961. Rails at first were 600 mm gauge but builders later
changed the trackage to 1067 mm. To exploit the iron-ore mines at Jamba and
Cassinga, a branch line was constructed in 1966-67. The branch line connected
Entrocamento, a main line station 525 km from Namibe, to Jamba (17 km from
Entrocamento) and th_n extended to Tchamina (96 km), a station close to the
Cassinga mines.
3.          In order to carry the predicted high volume of Iron ore traffic and
operate special purpose wagons with an axle load of about 20 tons, the track was
relaid from the mines to the Sacomar port with 45 kglm rails. The line was also
regraded, curve alignments were carried out and the Chela variant, connecting
Chela to Chanja by passing Lubango, was constructed resulting in a saving of a
distance of 33 km. As a result of these changes, 595 km of track is fitted with
45 kg/m rails and the rest, 312 km, with 60 lb/yd rails.
4.          Originally steel sleepers were provided, but during relaying of the
main line, these have been changed to wooden sleepers. The wooden sleepers have
%AzLV&Ma&ad wit,h age and in, critical sectluus, have been replaced with used
steel sleepers. The line is ballasted to varying depths with local granite. All
bridges are designed for 20-ton axle loads. Bridges on Namibe - Lubango - Jamba
route are in good condition. Four bridges on Menongue line and one on the
Cassings branch line have been sabotaged.
5.          CFM has 35 main line and 8 shunting locomotives. Sixteen of the main
line locomotives are diesel electric of U-20-C type supplied by General Electric
and 19 are diesel hydraulic of H 1500 type supplied by Krupp.   Of the GE
locomotives, six are in service, six can be repaired and four may have to be
scrapped. Seventeen of the Krupp locomotives require overhauling. All shunting
locomotives are diesel electric. CFM has a total of 1,416 wagons of which 94i
are special purpose wagons for transporting iron ore.   Approximately 1,040



- 30 -
Annex Al-a(ii)
Page 2 of 8
wagons, out of a total of 1,416, are tn service. Out of a total of 33 passenger
coaches, 29 ore in service although tho condition of 17 coaches is very poor.
With the paoenger traffic growing, the shortage In th. supply of coaches is
posing a serious problem.
6.          The main workshop at Lubango Is well-equipped. The workshop has good
facilities for machining, casting and forging. The workshop can be geared to
manufacture for other enterprises. There is an acute shortage of trained staff.
The large variety of deigns of locomotives used on CNN has added to the problem
of maintenance. Exchange of Xrupp locomotives with GE locomotives of the Luanda
Railway (CFL) can work to the advantage of both railways. The diesel shed at
Namibe is well-equipped. CFN has a total staff strength of 1600.
7.          Overhead open line wire circuit is used for communications.  Train
control is centralized at the control office at Lubango station. The posts and
line wire on the Sacomar - Lubango - Jamba and Cassinga routes were completely
reconstructed in 1966 with a three-pair circuit which Is used for block working,
train control, inter-station and line side coumunications. The circuits are
working offectively except in the Carvalhais - Ceasinga Mine section, where the
line has been sabotaged.   The old open wire circuit on the section from
Entrocamento to Menongue is not operational.
OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFOUNANC
8.          Details of operatinSg and financial performance of CFN for the last
ten years, i.e., 1981 to 1990, are given in Table 1. The operating ratio between
cost and income has, since 1984, been less than 100, indicating a surplus of
income over cost. The ratio Wa as low as 502 during 1989 but deteriorated to
752 during 1990, mainlr because of a decline in passenger traffic after the
currency reform of 1989 . Part of the surplus resulted, however, from: (1) very
low allocation, only about two percent of the total ewponditure, for maintenance
spares as a result of which major assets - locomotives, track, passenger coaches
and maintenance equipment - are In a totally run-down condition; and (2) very low
charge to depreciation due to not revaluing assets. Appropriate allocations on
these two components of cost coupled with heavy capital costs, such as debt
service charges, dividend on equity and increased depreciation', that would need
to be incurred subsequent to undertaking heavy investments for rehabilitating the
railway system, are likely to place CFMs' future profitability under considerable
strain,
9.          Passenger traffic - around 2 million a year since 1986 - dropped to
1.4 million during 1990. Freight traffic, also around 0.2 million tons and 45
million net-ton-km (ntkm) since 1986, droppod to 0.15 million tons and 35 million
atkm In 1990. As a result, the revenues a well as the operating ratio dropped

sipgificantly. More effective operations planning and aggressive marketing for
return export freight traffic can enable the system to surpass substantially the
previous traffic levels.  The incremental cost for such marketing would be quite
low". CFM also needs to plan to transport container traffic, currently almost
nil. Partly as a result of this constraint, CFK carried only 202 of the cargo
handled by the port during 1990. The level of accounts receivable is, currently,
quite high, with heavy amounts due from government departments and public
enterprises.
10.         Serious constraints to CPm's utilization of its full capacity and
increasing its share of freight and passenger traffic include:   (1) poor
availability and reliability of its main line locomotives and passenger coaches;
(2) systems and procedures falling Into disuse; and (3) most important,
substantial dilution in the skill level and competence of staff at all levels --
managerial, supervisory and operating. CPM's current staff strength of 1904 (32
managerial, 150 supervisory and 1722 workers) is higher than necessary on the
basis of reasonable productivity and efficiency norms but the percentage of
competent staff is quite low. Human resource and organization development, and
reestablishment of systems and procedures should Set the highest priority in any
strategy to enhance the commercial viability of CFM.
LONQ4UEM OEJEC2IVEB O? CPM
I1.         Efficient and cost-effective transport capability is crucial to the
economic growth of the southern region. Identifying and developing the right mix
of transport modes for various types of traffic li absolutely essential to
achieve this goal. With the inter-modal competition increasing, CFM's share of
traffic, both passenger and freight, would depend upon the extent to which CIM
can provide efficient and cost-effective service.   An intensive program of
efficiency improvement and cost reduction by CPM is essential. In the long-tenm,
CPH needs to pursue two main, though liter-related, objectivest (1) establishing
adequate c-ap.CILy to enable CP4 to carry its due share of local and transit --
to and from Namibia -- traffic by implementing a plan comprLesng rehabilitation
of existing assets, marginal new investments, and improved operating efficiency;
and (2) evolving and implementing a strategy and a plan for CFM to operate as a
commerciall,' viable entity.

program of training, technical assistance, computerization and logistical and
administrative support would be implemented.   Equipment rehabilitation and
locomotive maintenance elements, also a part of the CPM component of the IRE
project, would help CRM to increase its capacity to carry more traffic. Such
improvements also would help in reestablishing systems pertaining to quality
assurance, spare parts management, procurement of materials and services,
maintenance management, and costing, as well as providing opportunity for staff
to get training in real work situations. IRE project also would lay the basis
for a more effective and speedier implementation of the main rehabilitation
project by exposing the organization to the complexities of project management.
COMPQ%N?N DESCRIPTION
13.         The IRE project pertaining to CFM has six main components:   (1)
feasibility study; (2) technical assistance; (3) training; (4) equipment
rehabilitation,   including   locomotive   overhaul   and   maintenance;   (5)
computerization; and (6) logistical and administrative support.
Feasibility Study
14.         The major objectives of comprehensive feasibility study for CFM would
include (1) forecasting the total demand for the transport of short and long
distance passenger and freight traffic in the southern region of Angola; (2)
estimating CPM's logical share of each type of traffic, based on comparative
economic costs of competing modes of transport under different scenarios of
efficiency and productivity; (3) evolving a long-term strategy and an action plan
to enable CRH become commercially viable at some reasonable point in the future,
(such a strategy would focus on operations restructuring and improvement, cost
reduction, rehabilitation of existing assets, new investments, human resource
development, organization redesign, optimal pricing linked to traffic forecasts
and traffic demand elasticity, and capital restructuring): and (4) establishing
the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding between CFH and GOA setting forth
their respective authority and obligations for meeting the objective of
commercial viability. This understanding would address issues pertaining to
pricing, foreign exchange allocation, reorganization, staff changes, implementing
schemes for motivating staff, and creating rules and procedures for the efficient
running of the railways. (The same study will cover the operation of the port
of Namibe as described in section Al-a(i)).
Technical Assistance (TA)
15.         Since independence CFM did not have the advantage of technically
qualified and experienced personnel. As a result, systems and procedures in
almost all the departments require review, and updating. Common responsibilities
of different experts under TA program would include: (1) improving systems and
procedures and implementing them; (2) establishing improved nomse of performance
and recommending measures for achieving them; (3) training the staff at the
management level; (4) undertaking detailed training needs analysis to encourage
preparation of appropriate training programs; (5) computerization of the process
of operations planning and performance monitoring; and (6) implementing the
accepted recomendations of the commercial viability study.  Six experts Pre

16.         Four training experts are proposed for employmeent f^-r nne m"onths
each. Their responsibilities would include: (1) designing specific training
programv and preparation of course material for different groups of staff,
grouped on the basis of education and experience level, age and training needs;
(2) preparing training material for selected staff to act as traiters and conduct
training progrsms for them; (3) conducting pilot training programs along with the
selected staff to act as trainers; (4) based on the feod-back, refine and

equipment.
Eauiument Rohabilitation
17.         New Ecuioment: No new equipment is proposed for purchase under this
project. However, the agreement provide for procureme_t of spare parts to
ree.8oo1ioun (1) an induction furnace; (2) locomotive testing equipment; and (3)
calibration equipment. A few sets of tools also will be Included.
18.        Loeowotive Maintenance: Four of the 16 main line General Electric
locomotives are currently out of co.idesion, two because of accidents and two
for major defects. These locomotives are of U-20-C type fitted with an engine
of 2150 H.P. The comierial viability study, under Its terms of reference, would
make recomuendations concerning the fealbility and modality of recomissioning
these locomotives.  The mount of US$1.25 million has been set  side for the
overbaul of some or all of these ocomotives if t (1) the overhaul is considered
feasible both technically and economically; and (2) traffic growth trends are
consiatent with forecats.
19.         Four personal cemputer *ystie n, wlth appropriate extenions, printers

22.         The credit for the IRE project o eoxpected to be effective by October
1991. Angolan counterparts already have prepared terms of reference of the
comercial viability study for the Namibe Port Transport System acceptable to
IDA. After obtaining the necessary Bank approval for short list of consultants
and the Letter of Invitation, 4INTEC c"A invite offers and complete technical
evaluation and prepare to negotiate the final contract.   Consislering tho
mobilisation period, the study Can begin by November 1991 and finih by June
1992. TA and tradaing components could begin by Karch 1992 and end by September
1993.
23.         Even before the comencement of IRE, CFM has agreed to increase the
locomotive assignment for freight traffic from the current two to four and thus
lncrease the freight-carrying capacity from 150,000 tons a year to 250,000 tons
a year, assuming the traffic is avaiLable.  CF1 also would be in a position to
commence the return traffic of granite for export at a level of 3000 ton a moth
and gradually increas It to 10000 tons a month by Deemiber 1991.
24.         Implementation of the IRE project s  oxpected to result In the
following benefIts i (1) sustain freight-carrying capaioty of SSO,000 tons a year
of Uports and 180,000 tons a year of exportsl (2) neraseo passenger trafftc by
252 as a result of  mproved  aintenance and availability of locomtives and
coaches and prevento  of tickt-leo  travelling'  (3) improve performano
resulting In an increas  of revenue and decrease I  unit operating costs and
reduction in the operating ratio from the 1990 figure of 752 to about 602'; (4)
begin to reestablish systm and procedures, computerisation of performance
monitoring, and training of staff; and (5) most  mportant, establish a strategy
and a clear plan for CFM to becom a coamercially viable entity.

INFRASTIUCTURE REHABILITATION ENGINEERING (IRE) PROJECT
DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
NATIONAL BASIC HIGHWAY NETWO0
CURRENT SITUATION
1.          Angola's basic highway infrastructure remains essentially
unchanged since independence in 1975. The civil strife in subsequent
years caused the departure of the majority of the skilled Portuguese
highway personnel and resulted in a continuing decline of the highway
network condition.
2.          In 1987, Angola's highway network consisted of an estimated
75,000 km, of which 8,000 were asphalt and 4,000 were surfaced with
gravel.  The paved and gravel portions of the network, together with
approximately 18,000 kmn of earth roads, provide the basic economic,
administrative, and strategic links between the national capital, Luanda,
and the provincial capitals and municipal centers.   These roads also
provide access to railroads, port and airport facilities, and to
International border crossings. In the future, this 30.000-km network,
known as the "National Basic Highway Network* (NUN), will probably be the
scope of respoAsibility of a new national highway agency recently
organized with the assistance of international consultants.    The new
agency resembles the general structure of the former autonomous highway
commission of Angola (JAXA) which was abolished in 1975.  Since then,
responsibility for highways in Angola shifted between several departments

throughout the country, the government made little or no effort to manage
the overall highway sector. The new Angola Highway Institute (IDEA) began
operations in November 1990.
3.          The staff of INEA currently consists of one graduate engineer,
a tecanical specialist, a secretary, amd an" epatriate  te &a-±c±n.
Additional personnel, consisting of nine engineers, a geologist, an
economist, a lawyer, nine technicians and nineteen administrative support
staff, has been requested in the proposed INEA operating budget from April
to the end of Fiscal Year 1991. These personnel are available within the
existing staff of the Ministry of Public Works and Urban Development t
lMINCONS) and other government agenciesienterprises.
4.          As part of a short study for the creation of INEA,  a
Portuguese consulting firm retained by MINCONS surveyed the location and
condition  of highway  equipment belonging  to MINCONS.    The  survey
I Formerly the MinLstry of Construction



- 38 -
Annex Al-b
Page 2 of 6
determined that, of 736 pieces of equipment identified, 21% were usable,
61S were not operational, and the operational condition of 182 of the
units was not known.  Information obtained from INEA indicates that a
large number of MINCONS' road equipment fleet was purchased new in 1980-
81, but that a significant *umber of units did not function more than
1,500 bours, because of  improper operation or lack of maintenance, or
both.
5.          The consultant also surveyed the position oce'pied, location,
years In present position, and qualifications of highway personnel working
within tho MINCONS.   The results indicated that of 973 individuals
surveyed In tbhrteen of the eighteen provinces, 812 were qualifieds and
192 were not qualified for the positions they held.
6.          The consultant concluded that for new highway agency to
und-rtake road rehabilitation and maintenance with its own forces, it
would require a total of 2,570 employes. They would consist of 150 for
the Luanda headquarters, 280 for regional offices and 2,140 for provincial
offices. The survey found that existing qualified candidates could fill
only 750 of the needed positions. This lack of quallfied candidates to
fill current and future requiremnts for qualified highway personnel is
beyond the reach of a human resource development effort and an alternative
approach is needed (para. 8).
7.          An efficient highway system is critical for the economic
recovery and further development of Angola.  During 1987 the highway
sector carried approxztately 1.1 million tons of cargo, representing 382
'of nationwide cargo movments.  During the some period,g more than 16.2
mIlLion passengers, equivalent to 692 of all passenger movements
nationwide  traveled by road.  The end of the war will enable GOA to
apl_ment Its economic restructuring programs, and Intensify operating and
finaiael&  activity in all sectors.  !IOwvar; m'. voahahS41tation and
mainteance of the highwy   frastructure lead the improvement process,
the  country's  economic and financial perfomane will be severely
hampered.   fighway rehabilitation and maintenance, together with the
necessary highway Institutional and mangnt improvements, are key
ingredients to Angola's recovery.
LOG-Tym OIJZCTMSIV
8.        The purpose of organising INSA was to manage the planning,
design, constructlon, rehablitation and maintenance of Angola's highway
network. The long torm goal is for the Institute to become an autonomous
organisation fully deriving its financial resources from user charges
collected through a "highway fund" echanism under consideration by GOA.
Since policy makers also antlcaipat that most highway maintenance and
rehabilitation work will be performed by contract, INEA would not hire
more staff, nor buy equipment for direct in-house operations. However,
until the contractor industry develops sufficiently in Angola, INEA would
have to contract vork to foreign organisations. Some basic routine
maintenance may continue to be the responsibility of in-house labor and



- 39 -
Annex Al-b

equipment under the direct supervision of INEA. Ultimately, INtA's staff
would consist only of ongineors and other professionals, surveyors,
laboratory techniciamn, aid materials and construction inpectors.
IRE PROJECT COPONENT 0lJECTIVES
9.        Considering these operatioal constraints for INtA, the proposed
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Engineering Project (IRE) plans consulting
services to conduct a highway management study and prepare a highwy
rehabilitation and maintenance program for the National Basic Highway
Network (NB3N). The project also will provide support and advice to the
newly formed INEA in settlng up the basic organisational and
administrative departments it requires. The consulting firm will further
identify ares" where INEA can make management and operational improvements
with available resources.   Another objective will be to develop and
initiate a staff development program to train INEA personnel and highway
staff of local road contractors. The consultant will make an assessment
of  existing potential training  facilities,  lncluding  the  National
University and other technical education training institutions and present
recomendations.  The IRS component for the NBHN also envisions final
design and preparation of tender documents for th, highest priority road
sections -- estimated at 600 km. -- to be identified in the rehabilitation
program.
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Manatemnt Study
10.       The highway maagemnt study element of consulting services
will* (1) develop the necessary uanagement structure for lmplemntation
and flnanaing of the rehabilitation and maintenance program; (2) review
and recommend Improvements to the technical, economic, and financial
responsibilities  and  control mechanism.  (3)  review  and  recomend
liprovements to existing staffLng plans, as well as other physical and
financial resource requirements for INlA; (4) review and recommnd
improvements as necessary for the implementation of INEA's policies,
practices and procedureo, including design, construction and maintenance
standards  and  specifications,  environmental  assessments,  hlghway
maintenance program linked to the highway condirionas ;raiCic surveys saa
projections, user costs, and procedures for technical, economic and
financial asessment of road projects; (5) develop procedures for location
and condition surveys of all highway construction ntd aintenance
equipment purchsed by GOA since 1975, including analysis of potential
rehabilitation, end alternatives for selling or leasing such equipment;
and (6) review and recommend Improvements in the procedures for
procurement of consulting services, and for tendering of rehabilitation
and maintenance contracts in complince with applicable Government
regulations and international lending agencies' guldelines. This study
will require an ostimated 20 man-months of expatriate consulting services.

Hixhwav Rehabilitation Study
11.       The rehabilitation program development element of consulting
services wills    (1)  carry out  a comprehensive  survey of highway
rehabilitation requirements in Angola; and (2) develop a technically and
economically feasible, environmentally sound, highway and bridge
rehabilitation master plan for the NBHN, together with the necessary
highway maintenance program. This will ensure that proper and continuous
maintenance will begin on rehabilitated roads lmuediately upon completion
of the rehabilitation work. This element will require an estimated 30
man-months of expatriate consultant services.
Maintenance Manatement System Implementation and Trainint
12.       Computerized data base management systems are not presently used
in the national highway department. As part of the scope of work to be
accomplished under this component of the IRE project, local counterparts
will receive on-the-job training in the use of computers and in highway
management systems and procedures.
13.       The consulting services also will further: (1) design and guide
the implementation of a comprehensive maintenance management system for
INEA, including policies, practices, procedures and standards for
planning, budgeting and supervising routine and periodic maintenance
operations; (2) based on the overall rehabilitation and maintenance
program, conduct a training needs assessment and formulate and guide the
implementation of a continuous staff development and training program;
(3) design and assist in the implementation of a program of technical and
managerial assistance and trailnng for local consultants and contractors;
(4) provide continuous assistance to INEA during the period of the
contract in the overall management of the Institute and the NBHN, and in
presenting the rehabilitatio-n program to international lending agencies
for potential financial support. This component will require an estimated
70 man-months of expatriate technical assistance in the following
functional areass
i ghway engineering
. organization and management,
. planning and budgeting:
. environnental assessments,
economics,
. financlal management,
. personnel trainig,
field maintenance operations.
Technical Skill Improvement of Local Counterparts
14.       In order for INEA to absorb the maximum amount of management,
planning, and supervision skills from the expatriate consultants during
their contract period, local counterparts will work with the consultant on
a daily basis. (A list of the planned local counterparts to be assigned



- 41 -
Annex Al-b
Page 5 of 6
by INEA has already been prepared). An estimated US$100,000 has been
included in this component to cover the cost of short overseas training
courses -- lasting six to twelve weeks, probably in Portugal -- of the
following INEA personnels
. one planning engineer,
. on  economist,
. one financial analyst,
. one mechanical engineer,
. one computer programmer,
. one field project inspector,
. two secretaries.
Basic Eauitment and Administrative/Lotistic SuPport
15.       The critical  shortage  of adequate housing  for expatriate
consultant staff, and anticipated difficulties in obtaining equipment --
delays of four to six months -- will require efforts to acquire these
elements before consulting services begin. A provision of US$560,000 has
been included in this component for consultant housing. Costs of basic
equipment for traffic counts, weight control, communications, as well as
for office equipment and vehicles for consultants -- including operating
costs -- amount to an estimated US$1.44 million. Since local procurement
of spare parts and supplies is difficult, the foreign currency portion of
this component's estimated cost includes an amount designed to make it
possible to purchase and import these items from outside the country.
Principal types of equipment -- and spare parts and supplies -- include:
V vehicles,
office equipment such as computers and coplers,
traffic counters,
weight control scales,
communications such as telex, fax, radio.
COMPONENT COST
16.       Costs of the highways component of the IRE Project will amount
to an estimated base cost of US$8.47 million (US$0.90 million in local
currency, with US$7.57 million in foreign currency) (see details in
Section A3 and the suimmary below).

VRASMTRUCTURE REUABILITATION ENGINEIRING (IRE) PROJECT
pESAILED PROJECT DESCRIPMTOK
PORT OF LUAND COMPONENT
CURRENT BITUATION
1.   Port of Luanda is the main port of Angolg ond is known aS 'one of
the finest harbors on the West Coast of Africa'. Depths In the wide
entrance from the Atlantic Ocean vary from 24 m to 33 m, and In the
large anchorage from 15 to 30 a. It is vell protected on its seavard
side by Ilh de Cabo, a low narrow island about 6,5 km long, joined to
the mainland at Lts south-west end by a causewy.
2.   A Director GOneral, assisted by managerlal and technical officers
In different sections and departmemts, heads the Port of Luanda. The
port employed about 3,600 peopli as of January 1991, but plans to reduce
the staff to approximately 1,0 0. TSh port curretly is negotiating a
contract with a private steve ring company for operating actlvities.
The contract probably will b. effective in the near future.
S.    The main existing port facilities Include a total of 2,262 a quay
length with a total of 55,000 m2 covered storage areas In 18 cargo sbhds
and warehouses.
4.   Angolan authorities have used the year 1973 as a reference year
when they compare port traffic development after Independence. lI 1973,
Port of Luanda bandled 1,414,000 tons of general cargo, 602 for export.
Average traffic from 1977 to 1980 was about 750,000 tons a year. The
traffic from 1960 to 1090 has been volatile. Dry cargo declined up to
1982 but then ton"ge increased with a growth rate of about 72 a year
from 1984 to 1990. To 1990 the port handled 1,124,500 tons of general
cargo, mainly imgorte (987,800 tonnes or 882). In 1973 the coastal
traffic amountod to approximately 332 of the total traffic
(import/export). Tn 1988 the share was 72, and increased to 1 during
1990. The composition of traffic also has changed. The increase in
containerisation has beon particularly strong, increasing from less than
151 in 1984 to S52 in 1990, equivalent to 322,000 tons of imported cargo
(23,515 TWBs). Container export consists mainly of empties.
5.   Uhereas overall dry cargo -- excluding cabotage, oil and cement --
has Increased at about 72 a year since 1984, container traffic has growa
by more than 251 a year. This growth rate has caused substantial
operational difficulties in ship-to-shore actlvities as well as storage
at the container yard, resulting in extremely high dwell time of
containers in the port. The numbers of containers In the port,
averaging 10,000 In January, 1991, already exceeded the storage
capacity. Excess containers are scattered throughout the port wherever
space can be found. The figures obtained during the appraisal mission
indicate that lmport/export containers spend 80 days or more, on
average, In the port. The total number of containers on hand to



44 -                   Annex Al-c i)
Page 2 of 7
considerably higher than the technical/operational capacity of the
terminal and extremely high by international standards.
6.    The main causes of the high container dwell time for import
containers seem to be: (1) importers' shortage of funds to pay customs
duties and handling/storage charges; (2) cumbersome customs clearance
procedures; (3) slow onward shipment by truck and/or rail; and (4)
delays in cargo handling by the port of Luanda, including searching for
specific containers resulting from a shortage of proper equipment and
lack of a container tracking system.
7.    The cargo handling equipment is old and has lacked proper
maintenance for many years, mainly because of a shortage of spare parts
and skilled mechanics. The port's statistics indicate that by January
1991 less than 30 2 of the total equipment was operational. The main
reason why the port has been able to continue operating current traffic,
particularly container traffic, is that the shipping lines have provided
their own shore handling equipment to operate their vessels.
8.    Civil structures -- quays, buildings, sheds, storage areas, roads,
water supply, drainage, sewerage, electrical installations -- bear
striking signs of neglected maintenance. Signs of neglect are
particularly evident in the old parts of the port but also are
noticeable in the container stacking yard and along the container quays.
9.    Accumulated waste all around the port is hampering cargo handling
and storage. Scrap, including scrapped or damaged cargo and handling
equipment, tend to remain in the port area, because no organized
procedure exists for removal of these obstacles.
10.   Port of Luanda's income statements for 1987-1990 show that the
port is operating at a net profit, increasing from Rz 280 million in
1987 to Kz 562 million in 1990. However, the net income is misleading
since the depreciation -- Kz 30 million per annum -- does not reflect
the actual value of all operational assets. The tariffs, similar for
all ports in Angola, are from 1985 and do not reflect the actual cost of
services. Port of Luanda has elaborated a new tariff structure, but the
Government has not yet approved it.
LONG-TEE)( OBJECTIVES OF THE PORT OF LUAOFA
11.   The long term goals and objectives of the port of Luanda are (1)
to optimize the use of existing facilities and (2) to develop the port
infrastructure, acquisitions and management to cater for existing
traffic as well as anticipated growth. The strategy to attain these
goals depends on increased productivity and generation of sufficient
revenues to recover costs. Cost control also is u major input in
evolving a competitive tariff to sustain the market and hence to improve
earnings.

IRE PROJECT COMPONENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
12.   The first step in achieving these objectives is to evolve a long-
term plan. This plan should include (1) investments for rehabilitation
of existing assets and acquisition of new assets; (2) operations
improvements; (3) organization restructuring; (4) introduction of a cost
based tariff structure; (5) human resource development; and (6) systems
improvements through a development study. The study recommendations
would form the basis of preparation, appraisal and eventual approval of
a port rehabilitation project. The IRE project would further include
technical assistance to help making badly needed improvements in port
operations and equipment maintenance as well as training of human
resources. Such assistance would lay the basis for more effective
planning and implementation of the main rehabilitation project.
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
13.   The proposal for the IRE project for port of Luanda contains the
following componentss
(a)   Study
The overriding goals of the port of Luanda are to optimize the use
of existing facilities and to develop the port infrastructure,
acquisitions and management to cater for existing traffic as well
as anticipated growth. Over the past 15 years no major efforts
have occurred to improve systems in the port operation and
management to cater to the changing environment, particularly
concerning containerized traffic. The port of Luanda authorities
intend to re-examine the current infrastructure and equipment and
to evaluate the expected increase in demand for port services to
plan comprehensive development of the port of Luanda.

prepare an overall port development program for the period from
1991 to 2004; (2) prepare a program for improvement in operations;
and (3) recommend an appropriate financial strategy to expand port
of Luanda's profitability.
The study will undertake detailed traffic forecasts, operational
analysis, final engineering of emergency rehabilitation vork
required, and preliminary engineering investigations. The study
also will make a finamcial and economic assessment of various
development options available to port of Luanda in order to
determine the improvements necessary to enable the port to handle
the traffic anticipated to the year 2004. the study will also
explore the possibility for diversification with the view to
ensuring financial stability.
Estimated cost for the study is US$ 0.66 million.

(b)   Technical Assistance
Operations and maintenance shortcomings are evident in all port
activities. In some categories, particularly equipment and civil
maintenance, the problems have become serious. Authorities said
lack of spare parts and skilled staff was the main cause, but the
root appears to lie in institutional, administrative and
managerial problems in port operations. Control and regulation,
formulation of policies and objectives, organizational structures
and planning mechanisms are less effective than they should be.
The importance of maintenance and its costs are not fully
recognized. Budgeta at the government and port level have failed
to provide appropriate funds to cover these costs, although this
has resulted, in part, from lack of accurate Information oan costs.
Purthermore excessive control from government ministries Impairs
the port's ability to manage its operational and maintenance
functions. This is most evident In the approval of purchase
orders for spare or replacement parts, where it often takes
several months, or longer, before an order eventually can be
placed.
Technical assistance is essential for port administration/
operations, equipment maintenance, and civil works maintenance.
Another goal of such assistance should be to improve the skills of
staff within these departments as well as to introduce improved
operational and administrative systems which would aim at higher
productivity of cargo handling and lower cargo dwell tine. The
technical assistance experts will help to Ldentify urgently
required spare parts and assist in procuring them as well as
supervise-repairs -and maintenance of equipmeut.  Twelve man-months
of proposed technical assistance for this port component has been
tabled as unallocated. The rationale for this is to make it
possible to call oan short term experts during the Implementation
of the project to help meet special requirements. Some examples
would include electrical engineering for ship-to-shore cranes, or
hiring specialists in stores and supply, finance and
communication.
The Port of Luanda will provide qualified local counterparts to
work with the foreign experts. The counterpart and the foreign
expert, with the support of the management, will work towards the
eventual phasing out of the technical assistance position and the
full assumption by the counterpart of the responsibilities related
to the job position. The counterparts should be nominated and in
place before the foreign experts will begin their services.
Overseas training of counterparts might be advisable so that
counterparts and technical assistants are not separated for more
than 202 of the period of assistance.
The component provides 70 man-months of technical assistance in
the following areas:

Page 5 of 7
- port administrationloperations    24 months
- equipment maintenance              22 months
- civil works maintenance            12 months
- unallocated                       12 months
Estimated cost US$ 1.25 million.
c)    Trainint
The port has too few skilled personnel for an enterpris, seeking
to modernize its equipment and introduce new operating techniques.
Technical assistants will provide on-the-job training and the
consultant for the development study will develop a training plan.
Data for the plan will come from analyses of existing personnel
prepared by the port of Luanda in liaison with the technical
assistance experts. General objectives of the training plan will
bes (1) to improve the competencies of staff who can benefit from
further training; (2) to train new staff to either replace those
who will retire or increase the level in accordance with port of
Luanda's development plan for the concerned period; and (3) to
improve the management and organization skills of managers and
supervisors. The most urgent traainig need identified during the
first year of implementation will be carried out during the second
year of the IRE-project.
Estimated cost US$ 0.22 million.
(d)   Eauipmentlsnare narts
The total need for spare parts and equipment for the port of
Luanda must be carefully assessed. This component therefore
includes requirements (1) to keep the heavy fork lift trucks
needed to handle containers at a reasonable high operational
availability and (2) to rehabilite two Jones mobile cranes, which
have been in the port since 1985 without being commissioned. The
port of Luanda has agreed to put the mobile cranes into operation
before any further rehabilitation begins. If necessary,
authorities could transfer cranes to Namibe port. Technical
assistants, working with port staff, will identify workshop tools
and equipment, civil maintenance equipment, spare part
requirements and communication equipment before they submit the
list to the Bank for approval. A consultant engaged by the port
of Luanda completed a study on computerization of several
departments within the port and issued it in 1990. This study
will be reviewed by the consultant assigned to carry out the first
phase of the development study. The mid-term review may include
further discussions of financing initial stage of the
computerization oroject.
Estimated cost USS 1.29 million.

There is an acute shortage of houses in Luanda to accommodate the
technical assistance experts and the consultant for the
development study. Port of Luanda has agreed to arrange for three
fully f'2rnished prefabricated houses, to be erected at a plot
owned by the port adjacent to the port area. The port also will
provide six vehicles to transport the consultant for the study and
technical assistance experts during the project implementation.
The port also will provide basic office equipment.
Estimated cost US$ 0.46 million.

COMPONENT SCHEDULE
15.   The credit for the IRE project is expected to be effective by
October 1991. Terms of Reference for the development study as well as
letter of invitation and short list of consultants have been prepared
and agreed on during negotiations for the credit. Plans call for
completion of the development study within seven to eight months after
the contract with the selected consultant is awarded. Procurement of
eauipment and spare parts and technical amsistan.e and tralning would
begin twvo to four months after the credit is effective and would
continue for two years.
COMPONENT BENEPITS
16.   The Port of Luanda currently has exceeded its storage capacity of
containers because of low productivity and the extremely high dwell time
of more than 80 days on average for imports/exports. The low
productivity stems from (1) shortage of equipment, (2) poor maintenance
of the infrastructure, and (3) an inefficient tracking system.

Page 7 of 7
17.   High dwell time is expensive.  Bach additional day that a full
Import container spends in the port costs the economy an estimated US$
5, the capital cost of the goods, and another US$ 3-4 in demurrage
charges to the container owner if the container is not returned within
21 days of discharge, a total of USS 8,50. With current import volume
of 23,515 TEUs, and the extremely high dwell time, this represents a
cost to the Angolan economy of about US$ 16 million per annum. More
Importantly in the long run, high dwell time reduces the effective
operation and capacity of the port. Ship's waiting time and freight
costs vould both rise and, once the port has reached full capacity, it
would lose all additional traffic.
18.   A target for the IRS project would be to reduce the container
dwell time by at least 301 over the project period of 2 years. This
would allow the port to receive anticipated increased container traffic
and reduce the cost to the Angolan economy by US$ 4,800,000.
19.   Another major benefit of the IRE project would be a reduct!on in
the total number of ship berth days and the number of days that ships
spend waiting for a berth. Although the Angolan economy would not
receive immedic.tely the full benefit of the savings in ship's time,
lover freight rates and demurrage charges would help the country in the
long tern.

1.          Luanda is the capital of Angola and a busy port with considerable
potential for growth. The hinterland of Luanda includes the provinces of Zaire,
Uige, Bongo, KEanaa-Norte, Maloage, Luanda-Norte and Luanda-Sul.  The Luanda
Railway (Cfl) comprises a main line and 4 branch lines totalling a length of 537
km. The main line links Luanda to the city of Malange, 424 km inland and 1153 m
above sea level, is the inland terminal of CnL, a center of a rich agricultural
area producing coffee, sisal, cereals, cotton, tobacco and bee wax. Coffee grows
mainly In  igse, Kvanza-Norte, Jwanza-Sul and Bongo Provinces. The branch lines
connect Luanda to Cacuaco (18 km), Maceques to Xikolo (9 km), Zenma to Dondo (55
ka), and Canhoca to Golungo (31 km).
2.          In 1974 about 220,000 tons of coffee were exported through the port
of Luanda, but because of war, production has fallen to less than 102. However,
in 1984, coffee exports earned close to US$ 80 million. Other agricultural
products exported at that time included cotton -- 120,000 tons in 1973 and 30,000
tons in 1984 -- and sisal -- 67,000 tons in 1974 and 20,000 tons In 1984. Among
minerals, iron and manganese ores have been mined in Malange Province and known
deposits of copper and uranium  also exist.   Before independence, scant
development took place in the Angolan Industrial sector. only food processing
industry in the Luanda, Catete, Dondo and Malano areas and after 1966 the textile
industry in Luanda and Dondo were permitted to produce, mainly for domestic
consumption. Now, considerable industrial development can be expected.
S.          A Special Assistance Programm  for Angola, including one for Luanda
Port Transport System (LPTS), comprising CFL and the port of Luanda was prepared
in 1988 by the Southern Africa Transport Communications Commission (SATCC). In
the Special Assistance Programme for Angola, the rehabilitatLon projects for the
railways and the hinterland road network amounted to US$ 180 million.
DISCaPTIOB OP THE UtWORK
4.          Construction of a 600 mu gauge railway from Luanda Port to Fuda, 45
km inland, was completed In 1888; later the gauge was changed to 1 m and the line
extended to Lucala (364 km) by 1899 and eventually to Malangc (424 km) by 1909.
A 600 an gauge branch line was constructed from Canhoca to Golungo Alto in 1915.
This 31 km branch climbs 511 m, the last 17 km at an average of 1 in 38. Two
other small branch lines were built from Luanda to Cacuaco (18 km) and from
Mueeques to Klcolo (9 km). In 1944, a 5S km branch line was built to connect
Dondo to the main line at Zenza. In 1960 the track gauge was changed from 1 a
to 3..6' (1067 mm).
5.          All sleepers are steel, some dating from 1906 and many have been
repressed and punched with new belt holes to accommdate the change of gauge.

about 2500 is higher than necessary on the basis of reasonable productivity and
efficiency norms but the percentage of competent staff is quite low.  luman
resource and organization development.  Rnd reegtablisbment of systems and
procedures, would require the highest priority in designing any strategy for
turning around CFL.
LOpGTS                -OJETS F O
9.          Efficient and cost-effective transport capability is crucial to the
economic growth of the area of influence of Luanda and defining the right mix of
transport modes for various types of traffic is absolutely essential. With
inter-modal competition increasing, CFL's share of traffic, both passenger and
freight, would depend upon the extent to which the railroad can provide efficient
and cost-effective service. Implementing an intensive program of efficiency
improvement and cost reduction by CFL is, therefore, of immediate importance.
In the long-term CFL should pursue two major inter-related, objectivess (1)
establishing adequate capacity to carry its due share of local traffic by
implementing a plan comprising rehabilitation of existing assets, marginal new
investments, and improved operating efficiency; and (2) evolving and implementing
a strategy and a plan to operate as a commercially viable entity.
IRt P!_J* CT COHPONENT OBJECTIVES ANDSTRATEGY
10.         The CFL component of the IRE project aims at defining CFL's future
role in the transportation sector.  One goal is to establish the basis for
preparation, appraisal, and eventual implementation of a project for
restructuring CFL, concentrating upon human resource and organizational
development and systems improvement.   A- feasibility study is designed to
establish the techno-economic feasbillity of various transport options and to
evolve a long-term action plan. A program of training, technical assistance,
computerization and logistical and administrative support will encourage
development of human resources and instructions during the project period.
Equipment rehabilitation and locomotive maintenance, also elements of the CFL
component of the IRE project, wll help CPL to increase its capacity to carry
more traffic. These activities also will help to reestablish systems related to
quality assurance, spare parts management, procurement of materials and services,
maintenance management, and costing, and will provide opportunities for staff to
get training in real work situations. The IRE project also would lay the basis
for R more effective and speedier implementation of the main rehabilitation
project by exposing the organization to the complexities of project management.
CONPONENT DKSCRIPTIOI
11.         The IRE project pertaining to CFL has six main componentst  (1) a
feasibility study; (2) technical assistance; (3) training; (4) equipment
rehabilitation   including   locomotive   overhaul   and   maintenance;   (5)
computerization; and (6) logistical and administrative support.

Feasibility Study
12.         A comprehensive  feasibility study for CFL  is aimed ats   (1)
forecasting the total demand for the transport of short and long distance
passenger and freight traffic in the area of influence of the capital of Angola
and estimating CFL's logical share of each type of traffic, based on comparative
economic cost8 of competing modes of transport under different scenarios of
efficiency and productivity; (2) evolving a long-term strategy and an action plan
to enable CFL to become commercially viable at some reasonable point in the
future.    Such  a  strategy  should  focus  on  operations  restructuring  and
improvement, cost reduction, rehabilitation of existing assets, new investments,
human resource development, organization redesign, optimal pricing linked to
traffic forecasts, traffic demand elasticity, and capital restructuring; and (3)
establishing the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding between CFL and GOA
setting forth their respective authority and obligations for meeting the
objective of commercial viability specifically with respect to the issues
pertaining to pricing, foreign exchange allocation, reorganization, staff
changes, implementing schemes for motivating staff, and creating rules and
procedures for the efficient running of the railways.
Technical Assistance (TA)
13.         Since independence CFL did not have the advantage of technically
qualified and experienced personnel. As a result systems and procedures in
almost all the departments need review, updating and reestablishment. Common
responsibilities of different experts under TA program would includes   (1)
iproving systems and procedures and implementing them; (2) establishing improved
torms of performance and initiating measures for achieving them; (3) training the
Staff at the management level; (4) undertaking detailed training needs analysis
to facilitate preparation of appropriate training programs; (5) computerization
of the process of operations planning and performance monitoring; and (6)
implementing the accepted recommendations of the commercial viability study.
Your experts are recommended under the TA program. Extent and scope of their
specific responsibilities, in addition to those mentioned above, would includes
(a)   Locomotive and Rollina Stock Maintenances   (1) establishing and
implementing  optimal  preventive  maintenance   schedules;   (2)
introducing a system of quality assurance; (3) undertaking equipment
and process audit and initiating improvements; and (4) and resolving
recurrent maintenance problems (18 months).
(b)   Onerations:   (1)  establishing  and  implementing  optimal  train
running schedules and yard management practices; (2) improving the
levels of wagon turnaround and locomotive utilization; and (3)
facilitating improvement in infrastructure and methods of handling
cargo through discussion with users (18 months).
(c)   Track Maintenance:   (1) introducing a system of Directed Track
Maintenance (DTM), linking this with the purchase of track trolleys;
(2) undertaking equipment and process audit and initiating
mprovements; and (3) undertaking analysis of derailments and



- 54 -

initiating measures for improvement including better maintenance of
oharr curves (18 monthe).
(4) Protect Documentatlions (1) setting up a section for keeping records
of all studies, investigations, reports, and action plans; (2)
computerization of all records pertaining to progress In
implementation of all action plans and recomendations; (3) setting
up a system of monitoring progress of projects and programsl and (4)
finally facilitating the development of a project planning and
monitoring section (6 months).
Trainina
14.         The training program envisions employment of four training experts
for 6 months each. Their responsibilities would Include, for their reopective
areass   (1) designing specific training programs and preparation of course
material for different groups of staff, grouped on the basis of education and
experience level, age and training neods; (2) preparing training material for
selected staff to act as trainers and conduct training programs for thems (3)
conducting pilot training programs along vith the selected staff to act as
trainers; (4) based on the foed-back, refining and finalising the training
programs; and (5) recommending advanced training programs and mode of training
for specialized staff. staff groups agreed for training under this program aret
(1) operating staff, such as train staff, station masters, train control staff,
and train checking stafft (2) locomotive maintenance, both in the workshop and
the depots, and operating staff; (3) tariff and pricing; and (4) staff for
maintenance of track and track equipment.
Basic Equiment and Spares
15.         New -auipments New equipment to improve the quality of maintenance
will be purchased under this project. The equipment Includes (1) one locomotive
testing stand; (2) two numbers of calibration equipment; and (3) one test stand
for performing running tests on traction motors.   Track trolleys are also
proposed to enable CIL to switch over to the system of DTM.
16.         Locomotive Maintenance;  Eight of the 17 main line General Electric
and General Motor locomotives currently are out of commission. These locomotives
are the U 20 C type, fitted with an engine of 2150 H.P. and are about 20 years
old. The commercial viability study, under its terms of reference, would offer
recommendations concerning the feasibillity and the modality of recommissioning
these locomotives. A total of US$1.2 million has been provided for the overhaul
of up to four of these locomotives on condition that locomotive overhaul is
considered techno-economically feasible and traffic grows as anticipated. Spare
parts costing up to US$0.6 million have been proposed to enable CFL to maintain
a high availability of locomotives.

Comouterization
17.         The project proposes installation of four personal computer systems,
with appropriate extensions, printers and software. the goal is to improve the
process of planning and to monitor performance in the following departmentst (1)
locomotive and rolling stock maintenance workshop; (2) operations; (3) civil
engineering; and (4) project documentation section.
Loglstical and administrative SupDort
18.         To implement project components of the commercial viability study,
TA and training, 12 to 15 experts can be in place at one time in Luanda, the
headquarters of CFL. Because of the acute shortage of housing in the city, CFL
has undertaken to build new houses on railway land presently lying vacant. The
company also will provide furniture and fittings. CFL would need to use pre-
fabricated houses to build them in a short time. Offices for these experts also
would require renovation. CFL management would work out details of the number
of houses to be built and equipped. A total of US$.l million has been provided
to furmish houses and offices and US$0.05 million to purchase vehlcles.
COMPONENT COST
19.         The total base foreign cost of the CFL component of the IRE project
would be US$4.51 million and US$5.59 million including physical and price
contingencies. The corresponding local costs would amount to US$0.61 as base
cost and US$0.75 million including contingencies. (Details of costs of various
elements and the basis of procurement are in Table 2.)
COMPONNT SCEDL
20.         The credit for the IRE project is expected to be effective by October
1991. Terms of Reference of the commercial viability study for the Luanda Port
Transport System are under preparation.  After obtaining the necessary Bank
approval for a short list of consultants and the Letter of Invitation, MINTEC can
invite offers, complete technical evaluation, and prepare to negotiate and sign
the contract. Considering the mobilization period, the study can commence by
November 1991 and finish by June 1992. TA and training components could begin
by March 1992 and end by September 1993.
COMPONENT BENEPITS
21.         Even before the comnencement of IRE, CFL has agreed to increase the
locomotive assignment for freight traffic from the current one to three enabling
the additional container train to Dondo via Zenza to begin service and raise
freight-carrying capacity from 53,000 tons a year to 140,000 tons a year.
22.         Implementation of the component would result in the following
beuefites (t) sustained freight-carrying capacity of 190,000 tons a year of
imports and equivalent return container traffic; (2) a 252 increase in revenue
earnings from passenger traffic as a result of a sustained program of preventing

ticket-less travelling, estimated currently at about 50Z; (3) improved
performance resulting in an increase of revenue and decrease in unit operating
costs and reduction in the operating ratio from the 1990 figure of 1182 to less
than 10OZ4s (4) a strong impetus toward reestablishing systems and procedures.
computerization of performance monitoring, and training of staff; and (S) most
important, the availability of a strategy and a clear plan for CFZ to become a
comuercially viable entity.

C:urrent Situation
1.    The city of Luanda has experienced significant population growth in the
last 20 yeara. From a population of about 450,000 inhabitants at independence
in 1975, the number grew to an estimated 1.5 million in 1988. with a per annum
growth rate of about 102 in recent years.  Serious health and environmental
problems are counon. The city covers today an area of approximately 140 km2, and
the urban density varies from about 100 to more than 1,000 inhabitants per
hectare.
2.    The water supply system, under the responsibility of the Luanda Provincial
Water Company (EPAL), delivers water to the city from Rio Bengo. The system has
two transmission and treatment facilities with a total nominal capacity of
200.000 m3 per day, and an average production of 100,000 - 140,000 m3 per day.
A third small facility, located to the west of the city, provides water to the
municipality of Viana, with a nominal capacity of 17,200 m3 per day and an actual
production estimated at about 10,000 m3 per day. The total available storage
capacity is about 130,000 m3. Nearly half of it is not operating because of a
lack of pressure In the network or other operational problems. The distribution
network is about 520 km long. No lay-out or as-build drawings of the network are
available with EPAL. The number of official house connections amounted to 61,000
in 1989, with a total annual estimated consumption of 34 millions m3.  No
information is available on illegal connections, water losses or unaccounted-for
water volumes. The general efficiency of the water distribution network is very
poor. As per accounting and cost-recovery, out of a total value of water bills
oi Sid million Ex in 1969, EPAL has recovered only Z22 million Xz. Out of 310
official public stsad pipes existing in 1990, only 96 are functioning while the
remaining 214 are out of service for various reasons. A large part of the
population is served by parallel, public and private, systems of truck-
distributed water.
3.    Sewerage and storm drainage system  are  the responsibility  oi  4be
Provincial Government of Luanda (GPL). The networks are limited and in poor
condition. Severs and drains are generally out of order, clogged by solid
domestic wastes and all kinds of urban litter. Effluents discharge directly into
the sea or natural drains without any sewage treatment. Individual sanitation
systems, ranging from septic tanks to dry pit latrines, are spread widely over
all areas of the city.
4.    The solid wastes collection and disposal system also ie the responsibility
of the GPL. Managoment of the wastes collection and disposal system is presently
sub-contracted to a foreign private company. The system should be improved in
the urbanized area and extended in the suburbs. A new sanitary landfill should
be studied for final disposal of solid wastes.

5.    During the last 15 years, to improve the above described situation, GOA has
promoted an important set of studies.   Implementation has been limited and
partial, hindered by lack of funds and management capability. Consultants should
review, evaluate, &t t update all available studies.
6.    Furthermore, GOA recently has launched several investment co-operation
programs which are operating or scheduled to begin operating during the first
semester of 1991.   Other more  limited programs are being considered or
implemented by the African Development Bank (AfDB), UN Organizations (UNICEF,
'WHO, etc.), bilateral cooperation programs and NGOs. All these programs should
be considered and taken into account by the consultants for preparation of the
studies described hereafter.
Long-term Obiectives of Luanda Water Sunpiw. SeweraLe. Storm Drainaae and Solid
Wastes Disnosal Systems
7.    The main long-term objective of Luanda water supply, sewerage, storm
drainage and solid wastes disposal systems should be attainment of an appropriate
level of service for the whole urban commnity. The basis for the service should
be equity criteria, cost recovery, and consumers participation systems. The
first step to achieve these objectives is to elaborate a set of rehabilitation
studies comprising the overall inastitutional and organizational structure,
comprehensive plans for the upgrading and extension of the systems, and an
emergency program to be implemented in the immediate future.

LA   US SZ.PLAN MM MUSSER
Current Situation
1.          The population of Luanda estimated at 2 million people in
1990 represents one-fifth of Angola's 10 million people and about 45 of
the total urban inhabitants. The rapid growth of Luanda, averaging
about 10 a year in the last decade, has overwhelmed the capacity of an
urban infrastructure designed for a colonial elite of 250,000 persons.
Some 701 of the present population live in overcrowded, informal
settlements without piped water, adequate means of human waste disposal,
adequate storm drainage, electricity, solid waste collection, and
sufficient housing, schools and other urban services.
2.          A recent study found 761 of Luanda households depend on
public fountains, vendors, and means of water supply other than piped
water although in some neighborhoods, this dependency reaches 100?. On
average, water costs an estimated USS 1.00 ocr 200 liters.
*.          The disposal of human excreta in Luanda was inadequate and
presented a serious problem as early as the 19509. There is no sever
system. Roughly 13S of the population disposes sewage by connection to
the storm drain network ending in the Atlantic. Another 162,
reportedly, have septic tanks. The remaining 702 of the urban
population use shallow pit latrines prone to flooding in the rainy
season.  On averase, as many as 11 people share the use of a single
latrine. The number of households with pit latrines varies from 502 to
952 by barrio. Storm drainage in the musseques does not exist. Kitchen
and bath sullage are disposed In the yards and passageways, creating
eatendiw'g black water ponds in soaw areas lacking drain outlet.
4.          The first plan for Luanda in 1943 addressed only the
settlement needs of the colonial population. The native population was
established in informal and un-serviced settlements called musseques.
The 1973 Master Plan recognized the requirement for new native
settlement by designating barrio populares on the South African township
model.  The plan provided urban services, separate from the colonial
city, in the few sites that were built. This plan did not extend
services to the existing musseques. With the pressure of rapid
urbanization and informal subdlvision of plots, the barrios populares
have grown. as have the older musseques, beyond the original population
densities. They now resemble each other with haphazard subdivision of
lots and poorly maintained infrastructure.
5.          A 1979 master plan proposed clearing the musseques and
replacing them with medium and high rise apartments organized in



- 64 -                  Annex Al-dii)
Page 2 of 5
superblock configurations. Overly ambitious in their use of financial
and other resources, these proposals remain unrealized. Basic urban
services coverage remains the same to it was at the time of
Independence. Subsequently in the early 1980s, the government
encouraged new housing construction and urban expansion by returning the
responsibility for building to the prospective householder. Termed
auto construgSoO by the law of the same name, this program provided
building sites with regular streets and lots, and, for those who
qualified, the right to buy construction materials at official prices.
Largely appropriated by the middle class and those with influential
connections, this program did not provide essential services such as
water and sanitation.
6.          Effectively, urban planning and lnformed development of
urban services are non-existent. The 1979 plan policy of eradicating
the musseques emphasised public buildings and the aesthetics of design
Instead, overlooking the Importance of enviromental and financial
resources. The result is a costly urban development pattern for
infrastructure servicing and one which is environmentally precarious.
7.          The Goverament of the Province of Luaud  (GPL) has limited
capability for planning. Local development planning is a central
government actlvity for the alleged reason that scarce personnel should
be used efficiently. Devolution of the responsibility for planning to
GPL, and understandings achieved In discussions during the appraisal
mission, are a first step. There ls nusufflcient professional staff to
carry out planning. More critically, there is a lack of knowledge of
the uses and procedures of land use planning, that would create a demand
for it. These defiiencies can be remedied by beginniag to develop the
capabilities of professionals and technicians by means of on-the-job
training and work experience. The government has agreed to assign 10
professionals and 26 techbicians to the study. They will come from the
GPL, the National Institute for Physical Planning, and the GCodeol.c and
Cartographic Institute.
Urban Plannint in Luanda
8.          The l13 Project will help reorient planning efforts In
Luanda tot (1) improve lnformation and data about urban land for
developments  (2) develop awareness of environmntal prthlo,w and need
for their corrections (3) improve planning skills including survey
design and analytic skills; (4) transfer planning technology for the
efficient assignment of land to uses; (5) anticipate infrastructure
needs and provide capacities to plan for those needs; (6) introduce
methods of urban upgrading; and (7) develop institutional capability.

9.          The objectives of the urban component of IRE are tot
(1) develop an approach to the future urban expansion of
Luanda, which will manage land use while enhancing the
environment and minimising infrastructure costs;
(2)   provide methods for the delivery of affordable
services aud upgrading of existing settlements with
full cost recovery;
(3)   carry out a feasibility and final engineering study
and prepare an urban upgrading projects
(4)   create awareness of the need to correct urban
onvironmental problems to improve living conditlons
and enhance public healths and
(5)  help establsh a sustainAble urban upgrading process.
10.         The urban infrastructure component for the city of Luanda
will finance a study whlch will prepare a lnd development plan, an
urbma upgradLog pilot project, and a priority list of projects for
subsequent project developmt work. Coordinated with water and
sanitation master plan elements of the Lu anai 23  component, the
component consists of a two-year study which vlll Include institutional
development and provlde traintig to government personnel at the national
and provlncLal levels.
11.         The urban land use and Infrastructure plan will, (1) define
policies to guide future urban expansion and configure streets and
other Infrastructures (2) project future population settlements and land
uses (3) determine the extent of the needs for basic urban services; (4)
desLgnate ways to enhance, or protect, publle health and the
eavironments and (5) minimize the costs of provlding urban
infrastructure.
12.         The pilot muhseque upgrading project to be prepared under
the study will demonstrate vays to lmprove the health, envlronmental,
and living conditLons of the musseque inhabitants and designate ways to
recover the costs of proposed investment. It will demonstrate that the
improvement of existing urban settlements is poseLble and affordable,
enlarging possLbilities for greater application of upgrading in Luanda.
The study will propose litegrated actions to Improve condLtions for So
to 40 thousand persons.
1.         All training of approximately 40 counterpart staff
conteplated will be on-the-job training. The consultant responsible
for the study will train the counterpart staff by integrating them into
the study team. The conoultant w1il attend to the formal trainLng needs

which may become apparent. The only separate technical assistance
considered under this component is for environmental expertise totalling
about twenty-eight man-months. (Described in section B.2).
Datu Organization and ComDuterization
14.  the use of computers is not widespread in the GPL. The
Introduction of computers, and on-the-job training in the use of
software, will increase analytic capabilities and achieve increased
productivity which will help relieve some of the problems posed by
insufflcient numbers of qualified personnel. The study will assess the

,Comonent Benef its
17.         Major benefits anticipated by the study are:
(1)   generation of population projections and other data,
including mapping of infrastructure conditions for land use
and other planning vork, assembly of information in one
place for efficient referral for the study, and for other
studies and projects being conducted in Luanda;
(2) development of a land use plan taking into consideration
land-carrying capability to assist the coordination of
government units and international agenciest
(3) preparation of a project of urban infrastructure upgrading
In a low income urban areas
(4)   increased awareness oft (a) concepts of environmental
protection or enhancementg (b) cost recovery and ability to
pay; (c) linkage of infrastructure improvements to public
health improvements; and (d) on-the-job training of public
officials;
(5) institutional and procedural change, or recommendations for
such change.
18.          Implementation of the urban plan and the upgrading project,
would contribute to increases in urban incomes due to individual savings
of time, lower morbidity, reduction of days of work lost and income
foregone, lower health costs, and diminished exposure to environmental
hazard. Construction of the infrastructure for musseque upgrading would
create jobs, directly and indirectly, producing income for both
individuals and local government. The infrastructure improvements would
support creation of small enterprises, or make existing enterprises more
competitive. The institutions brought into play by the component and
their responsibilities are detailed in aectil- 3.3 o^ project executlon.

INPRASTRUCTURE RESAILI?TI MON UNGINRZXIGRN PROJECT
TECHNIC  ASSISTAMCK ND AM ATRINI
Introduction
1.          The IRS Project conceived as a TechnLeal Assistance Project
to prepare priorLty rehabilltatlon work of the Infrastructure sector in
Angola, rests on the realization by IDA and the GOA that there is a
need to build instLtutional capacity pari-pasu with the preparatlon of
the civil works requlred. Project desLgn has taken into account the
findings of ORD Report No. 8573 on TA projects in Africa.
2.          The lack of institutional capacity calls for expert
assistance on the engineering design and feasLbility study phases of the
works to be undertaken. The preparation work itself gives a unique
opportunity to address the lack of capabillty issue. Most components of
the project include, in addition to the consultants who will do the
studies, technical assistance to set up the procedures and mechanisms
necessary to the follow-up and analysis required within the miaistries
and sector agencles involved. Such technical asositance alone, will not
be sufficLent to build-up the capacity of these instLtutions,and
training elements, both formal and on-the-job training, have been built
into the project.
S.          The careful definition of the technLcal assLstance aspects
of the project requires, nevertheless, a further ingredient to increase
its chance of success,i.e., regular IDA supervlslon as well as country
dialogue in the course of future economLc and sector ork.  This section
addresses the areas to which special attention has been paid, the
resources applied to the task, and administration and coordLnation
aspects of the technlcal assistance and training included under the
project. Section B.4 shows the supervisLon plan of the IRE project.
Areas of SDecial locus
4.          In bringLng forth the IRE project, IDA paid particular
attention to the need tot
(1)   brLig to bear relevant sector experience on the
integratLon of project preparation with technical
assiLtance, lnstitutional development, and staff
development aspects of the project;
(2)   plan for a substantial supervision Input to help
detect as early as possible implementatLon
difficultles and propose corrective actionst

(3)   link the project to future sector work under
discussion with GOA, reflected in the project'.
conditionality which orients the sector institutions
to the most pressing sector issues and to the best
possible use of technical ssistanc.l
(4)   have terms of reference fully discussed for all key
positions for technical assistance In the course of
technical discuwsions at the time of negotiations; and
(5) ensure that reporting associated to the project will
allow the analysis of the contributions made by the
experts during project Implementation.
5.          On the part of GOA, the salient features aret (1) a fitm
comuitment to the transformation of the Angolan economy; (2) desire to
adopt a long term strategy to introduce cost effectiveness and
liberaliation of the infrastructure sector; (3) interest in
establishing full cost recovery for all services as means to achieve
cost effectiveness; and (4) full acceptance of the need to Import --
and borrow for -- the required expertise and skills.
Resources Allocated
6.          The section A3 gives the resources allocated under the
project to technical assistance and training for a total of US$ 14.26
million. This does not include estimates for the resource cost of on-
the-job training when performed as part and parcel of the consultants
work in carrying out studies. The actual figures will be known at the
time of consultant selection. The costs of on-the-job training have been
considered in the estimation of the study cost when this has been chosen
as the best vehicle for such training. The total above underestimates
io&ewvaat the actuwa resources devoted to technical assistane and
training within IRE.
Coordination and Administration
7.          Responsibility for each component's technical assistance and
training will rest with the component's coordinator. A training and
staff development specialist will be part of the central coordinating
team (Annex B-3 gives project execution arrngements) to assist In
matters concerning the organization and monitoring of planned activities
to avoid duplication and benefit from the complementarities which may
exist. The staff development specialist will be also responsible for the
formulation of the staff development plan necessary across agencies for
the eventual preparation of sectoral Investment programs and expenditure
reviews. This teak will be performed In close coordination with the
work to be carried out under the Economic Management Technical
Assistance Project.

Procurement
1.          Procurement capabilities would be assured by the central
coordination offico in the Ministry of Planning and technical assistance
(Annix B-3, para. 1). Procurement la expected to take place In
agreement with the implementation schedule of the project. Nearly 702
of project procuremet will be subject to prior IDA review. No lese
than six contracts for an aggregate value of US$10.62million equivalent,
Including contingencies, would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB), In accordance with the Bank's guidelines for
procurement associated with consulting services and equipment. To the
extent practical, contracts would be grouped in bid paekages estimated
to cost the equivalent of US$500,000 or more to permit efficient
procurement. For the purposes of evaluation and comparison of bids
under ICB, a preference of 152 or the value of the applicable customs
duties, whichever is lower, would be allowed for material and equipment
manufactured in Angola. Review of bid documents prior to contract would
be required for all consulting services contracts and for equipment
contracts above US$75,000.
2.          A number of small aiso contracts of leos  than US$500,000 to
import prefabricateod. housing units. and 8$100,000. for goods-and not
likely to attract foreign suppliero, way be awarded on the basis of
competitive bids advertised locally, but also open to foreign firms.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that a procurement seminar
would be held in Angola before credit effectiveness and Bank staff would
teole t ohet epr   ty to review the borreoer'e procedures for
advertising, public bld opening, clarity of evaluation criteria, award
to lowest bidder, non-exclusion of foreign bidders from participation,
and need to obtain IDA's agreement the first time this procedure io
utilized. These contracts would cover malnlys (1) office equipment,
furniture and furnishings for consultants end project coordination; and
(2) minor rehabilitation of housing and office fel-rtt.,'
consultants. In addition, loel shopping for contracts under $10,000
will be allowed (para. 6 below).
3.          The Bank's guidelines Including IDA review of short lists
would be used to select the consultants for teachalcal assistance,
training sad studies financed under the credit.
4.          Locally procured goods as part of operating expenses, are
not eligible for IDA procurement. These would be procured from dealers
on the basis of quotations obtained locally.

7.           Disbursements for the project will be made without recourse
to a special account (revolving fund). To ensure availability of
counterpart funds, GOA will open a project account in U8 dollars two
months after effectiveness at a comorcial bank, with an initial deposit
of US$500,000 to be replenished every six months, and to be managed
exclusively by the projoct coordination office. In the case of payments
for techical assistance and consultants contracts, procedure III of the
Bank Guidelines will be followed (Sank Guidelines, Annex II, pars
11(i)). Monitoring, accounting and reporting will be done as indicated
in section B.3 on project execution.

INFRASTRUCUI$RE IMILITATION ENGIN NG PROJECT
BVIRONKEVTAL ASPECTS
1.         Improvement of the urban envirorment and comervation of
Angola's natural environmet will be on inherent part of the IRE
Projects' objectives. Environmental rehabilitation should be a goal of
each Project's component with a view to solutions based on both
envlronmentally sound practices and sustasnable development.
2.         The IRE Project refers only to rehabilitation of existing
systems. Nowever, such rehabilitation sbould provide for correction of
negative environmental impacts Incurred during prior implementation of
the system rather than perpotuating the resulting problems. Each

City of Luanda (UICL)I the Ministry of Transport and Communcations (MINTEC) for
the Namibe and Luanda Port Transport Systems (NPTS and LPTS)I and MINCONS for the
National Basic Highway Network (ElHN). Each project component will be the
responsibility of a specifically designated component coordinator. MINPLAN's
National Directorate of Investments and Construction (DNIC) will be responsible
for overall groiect coordination, and will chair a urolect steering committee.

representatives designated by the Ministry of Finance and the Angolan Central
Bank. It will meet twice a month to guide and direct the execution of the
project during its period of effectiveness. Each component coordinator will
develop action plans and schedules for each component, submit them for review by
-the Steering Committee, -and- forward them to IDA for comments.

agreements will stipulate that CPL and responsible ministries will give
individual component coordinators ample powers to manage, monitors, audit and
report on the execution of their respectiv6 individual components. GUA has
designated the Ministry of Planning (MINPLAN) as its official representative in
connection with projects supported by the International Development Association
(IDA). For purposes of the IRE Project, MINPLAN will grant ample powers to DNIC
for overall coordination, monitoring, auditing and reporting operational and
financial performance to GOA and IDA as frequently *ad In the level of detail to
be agreed upon at IRE credit agreement negotiations and included in the
implementation agreements. While urolect execution is scheduled for 30 montbs.

place eighteen months after effectiveness to examine the implementation of the
project, decide on the items which should be retained in the investment program
for the sector and select from these the projects for which final engineering
will be carried out. At this time, project finances will be reviewed and
reallocation of funds available to the project may take place as a result.
