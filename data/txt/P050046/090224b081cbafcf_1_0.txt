                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Approximately 90% of the AF grant of US $10 million has been disbursed while the entire amount of the original credit (US$70 million) has been fully disbursed. The third component
                         of the project was revised during project restructuring in October 2011 and two new sub-components were added to support reforms related to human resource (HR) management.
                         The remaining funds have been committed for disbursement by end of June 2013 and planned activities are being finalized. This project was originally designed as an Adjustable
                         Program Lending with three phases. However, to date only one phase has been implemented and the continuation of the other two phases under APL are not envisaged.
