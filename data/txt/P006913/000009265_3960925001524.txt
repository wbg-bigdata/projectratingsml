FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1187-CR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on Costa Rica's Fourth
Highway Project, for which a loan in the amount of US$39.0 million was
approved by the Executive Directors on December 30, 1975. The Project was
also supported by loans from the Venezuelan Investment Fund, the OPEC Fund
and funds freed from the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1845-CR). Funds from
Loan 1187-CR were fully disbursed on July 16, 1984, and project
implementation is continuing with funds provided by Loan 1845-CR.
This Completion Report was prepared by the Bauk's Latin America and
the Caribbean Regional Office and is based upon information obtained from the
Minutes of the Board Meeting, the LAC Information Center, Appraisal Report
No. 831a-CR, staff supervision reports, consultants' reports and information
gathered by a Bank mission that visited Costa Rica in October 1984.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report har been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent t..v the Borrower for comments. Comments received have been
taken into.account and are shown as Annex 2 to the PCR.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1187-CR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The Fourth Highway Project was successful in achieving its main
objectives: the construction of the San Jose-Siquirres highway to provide a
new link between the capital city of San Jose and the port of Limon, and the
strengthening of the planning capabilities of the Ministry of Public Works
and Transportation (MOPT). Substantial delays and cost overruns, however,
forced a reduction in the scope of the project and led to a decision to
allocate funds from Loan 1845-CR to finaare the completion of the civil works
component.
Substantial problems were experienced in the implementation of the
civil works component of the project, caused mainly by the organizational and
financial weakness of the contractors Because of the slow progress of the
works MOPT, which was responsible for the construction supervision, took
successive, well intentioned measures to avoid further delays and/or cost
increases, such as: (i) advancing payments to the contractor; (ii) pressing
the contractor for an inordinate amount of subcontracting; (iii) taking over
the technical and financial management of the civil works; and (iv)
implementing, with Bank approval, a change in the alignment of a road section
before the supporting studies were ready.
These measures, however, rather than improving the contractor's
output, complicated project implementation by blurring the roles of the
independent supervision ard the superintendence of works. Finally, in
October 1981, MOPT canceled the original contract on the grounds that:
(i) the original contract had expired and only 60% of the programmed works
had been completed; and (ii) the contractor's lack of technical, managerial
and financial capacity was affecting not only the fulfillment of its own
responsibilities, but also the performance of the subcontractors.
Before works could be resumed, the Borrower and the Bank agreed
that the following measures had to be taken: (i) completion of financial and
technical audits of the original contract; (ii) payment of outstanding debts
to the subcontractors; (iii) adthorization from the General Comptroller of
the Republic to proceed with the works under new contracts with the former
subcontractors; and (iv) estimation of work quantities still to be executed
on the different road sections. Actions toward fulfillment of these tasks
took about ten months, and could not be complets A, satisfactorily, mainly



v 
because the dramatic disarray of the project records made the assessment of
works performed and payments made to the original contractor difficult.
Works were resumed at various dates in late 1982 and early 1983 and are
proceeding according to the revised schedule. Some road sections are already
open to traffic, and the final completion date of the San Jose-Siquirres
highway is estimated for June 30, 1986.
The Project Completion Report critically reviews the main issues
arising from the project and draws the following lessons and conclusions:
(a)  the process d pre-qualification should not be limited to the
routine review of documents presented by the candidates;
(b) contract packaging should carefully weigh the trade-off between
economies of scale and risk;
(c) project supervision should be designed in a way in which
responsibilities and accountability are clearly defined;
(d) the Bank should have advised the Government, at an early stage, of
the logical alternative of cancelling the original civil works
contract and retendering the works, rather than going along with
measures that did not achieve their objectives. Those measures
merit the following comments:
(i) excessive subcontracting defeats the purpose of the
prequalification process;
(ii) MOPT's intervention in the financial and technical management
of the contract diffused responsibilities; and
(iii) t.a Bank should not have approved changes in the road
alignment when the final supporting studies were not ready;
(e) the technical assistance for transport planning was successful,
mainly because of the active participation of the local counterpart
staff in achieving the objectives of the assistance;
(f)  Bank projects should aim not only at strengthening the planning
capabilities of the Borrower but also at ensuring that those
capabilities will be effectively used in the investment decision-
making process;
(g) in spite of the importance that the Bank gave, during project
preparation, to lmiting investments in the Atlantic Railway, the
Bank, during negotiations, agreed tG a covenant that did not fully
reflect its earlier concern; and
(h) an economy-wide shortage of counterpart funds should prompt the
Government to reassess the priorities in its investment program.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAA 1187-CR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Costa Rice  has an area of 51,000 km2 and a population of
2.4 million; the country's main cities and over half of its population are it
the elevated and climatically equable Central Valley, where most of the
emerging industrial activity is located and the bulk of the country's coffee
is produced. About one-fifth of Costa Rica's GDP originates in agriculture,
one-fourth in manufacturing and construction, and the rest in transport,
trade and other private and Government services. In value terms, coffee and
bananas are the main export products; next in importance are beef, sugar,
textiles and cacao. In volume terms, bananas are the most important,
followed by coffee and sugar.
1.02       Transport plays an important role in the economy of Costa Rica
because of the country's heavy reliance upon export crops and the growing
volumes of imported basic raw materials and manufactured goods. The increase
of trade among different regions in the eountry and the opening up of new
lands for productive use are becoming more important. The country, however,
has topographical and climatic features which make the provision of transport
facilities both difficult and costly.
1.03      Bank involvement in the Costa Rica highway subsector started in
1961 with the approval of the First Highway Project (Loan 299-CR/Credit
10-CR, US$11.0 million). The project assisted in financing the first stage
(630 km) of the National Highway Program and also included maintenance and
construction equipment; the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (now the Federal
Highway Administration) provided technical assistance. A reduced program of
510 km of roads was completed satisfactorily in 1968. In 1970, a second Bank
financed project was undertaken (Loan 664-CR, US$15.7 million) comprising,
essentially, construction of a new 57 km two-lane paved highway between
Siquirres and Limon. The road was completed in 1975. Originally, this
project also included a feasibility study of an improved highway link between
San Jose and Siquirres, but the study was subsequently removed from the
project and combined with detailed engineering to form the Highway Studies
Project (Loan 872-CR, US$1.4 million, 1972), which led to the Fourth Highway
Project, the subject of this report. The Bank group also supported 107 km of
feeder roads improvement in the Canton of Perez Zeledon, through the
Agricultural Credit and Development Project (Loan 1410-CR, June 1977, US$18.0
million; Credit 872-CR, June 1977, US$9.0 million), of which US$0.8 million
was allocated for, and spent upon, roads.



1.04      This completion report is based on information obtained from the
minutes of the Board meeting, the LAC Information Center, project appraisal
and supervision reports, consultants' reports and information gathered by a
Bank mission that visited Costa Rica in October 1984.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      At the end of 1972, as mentioned in the preceding chapter, the Bank
made a loan to Costa Rica for a Highway Studies Project covering: (a) a
feasibility study for improving the road links between San Jose, Siquirres
and Puerto Viejo or constructing new ones; and (b. detailed engineering for
the economically selected highway alternative.  The feasibility study, which
demonstrated the economic advantage of constructing new links, was carried
out by a US-Costa Rican consulting joint venture and finished in late 1973.
The same joint venture was retained for the detailed engineering of the new
roads, which was substantially completed by the end of 1974, and which,
together with the feasibility study, formed the basis for the main element of
the project. Both studies were found satisfactory hy MOPT and the Bank.
2.02     The Bank's main concern during project preparation was the lack of
adequate planning in the transport sector of Costa Rica. In particular,
possible investments in the Atlantic Railway, which the Bank assessed as
uneconomic, helped to advance the view that the project should serve as a
vehicle to rationalize investmenc decisions in the sector.
2.03      The project was appraised in December 1974, and an Issues Paper was
circulated on January 9, 1975. The Decision Memorandum, issued on January
30, 1975, dealt mainly with:
(a)  the possible change in the size and scope of the project, as well
as the loan amount, if bids for civil works were unsatisfactory;
and
(b) the need to obtain, prior to negotiations, the Borrower's
commitment to the effect that no investments in its Atlantic
Railway would be made and/or approved before ascertaining their
full economic Justification. In the long run, the Bank's objective
was to help to initiate overall transport planning in Costa Rica,
and, if necessary, technical assistance to that end was to be
included under the project. Furthermore, it was agreed that
implementation of sectoral planning (i.e., establishing a transport
planning office and making it o erational) would be made a dated
covenant of the loan agreement. /
1/   The covenant was not included since the Transport Sector Planning Office
(TSPO) was created, by Decree No. 4956-Y of June 27, 1975, within the
Ministry of Public Works.



-3-
2.04      Negotiations wera held on December 3, 1975.  The discussions
included, inter-alia, a proposed covenant related to investments in the
Atlantic Railway. The Bank's objective of obtaining a specific commitment
from the Borrower regarding these investments was not reached. Rather it was
decided that the agreement would be stated as a general obligation of the
Government to carry out its investments in the transport sector on the basis
of adequate economic justification. Also at that t.me, it was agreed to
include, in a supplemental letter, more specific obligations regarding
investments in the railway. However, subsequent to negotiations, the
Government did not consider the supplemental letter necessary. The Bank,
feeling that there were sufficient assurances from the highest Government
officials that such investments were not likely to occur, accepted the
Government's point of view. (The Bank interpreted the setting up of TSPO as
a sign of the Government's firm commitment toward sound planning in the
sector). Also, during negotiations, the Government and the Bank agreed to
include, in the project, technical assistance to TSPO for the preparation of
a National Transport Plan and an Urban Transport Study.
2.05      A loan for US$39.0 million was approved by the Executive Directors
on December 30, 1975. The approved project elements and their costs, as they
appear in the appraisal report, are shown in the table on the following
page.
2.06      Works were expected to be completed in April 1980, and the Loan
Closing Date was set for October 31, 1980.
III. PROJECT IMPLENENTATION
A. Civil Works
3.01      For bidding purposes, works were divided into six lots, five 'or
road sections and one for major bridges. IThe prequalification process was
delayed by the Government's decision to reopen the process at the suggestion
of interested parties claiming that they had learned about the project only
after it was too late to prepere the relevant documents. Bidders were
allowed to bid for one lot or for any combination of lots, including the
complete package, according to their respective prequalification.
3.02      On June 23, 1976, nine firms or joint ventures (five local, three
foreign and one foreign local) submitted proposals for the works, although
twenty one (five local, fourteen foreign and two foreign local) had been
qualified. The lowest evaluated bid was that of an Ecuadorian firm, bidding
for the whole package using the asphalt alternative for the pavement aad the
prestressed concrete alternative for the bridges2/. The bid price, which
2/   For two of the road lots, there was the alternative of bidding for
either asphalt or concrete pavement, and, for the bridges lot, bidders
had the option of bidding for steel bridges or prestressed concrete
bridges.

Included 8% discount if the firm was awarded the complete works, was the
equivalent of US$49.2 million, about 1% above the Bank's appraisal estimate,
updated to mid-1976. T.ie contractor, in spite of the express requirement
spelled out in the bidding specifications, did not present the list of key
staff to be assigned to the project. Also, the bidding documents showed that
the contractor needed to purchase most of the equipment to be used in the
project. In spite of these warning signals, the favorable bid price and the
satisfactory performance that the contractor had had in Costa Rica seem to
have dispelled any doubts which might have arisen at the time. As a result,
MOPT proposed to award the contract to the Venezuelan firm, subject to a
satisfactory reply regarding key staff and equipment. The Bank agreed to
MOPTts decision, and the contract was subsequently awarded.
3.03      As in the previous Bank-financed  highway project, the
responsibility for civil works supervision was laid directly upon MOPT. The
US-Costa Rican consulting joint venture that had been involved in project
preparation was retained by MOPT to provide supervision assistance but only
in an advisory capacity.
3.04      Construction began in March 1977, about one year later than the
appraisal schedule, because of the extension of the bidding period and the
time elapsed until the approval of the construction contract by the National
Assembly. Progress was very slow from the start, and MOPT conveyed to the
contractor the need to improve its organization, but to no avail. In a
two-year period, the contractor changed its management staff three times, and
the problem of poor organization was compounded by financial difficulties.
MOPT, realizing that substantial progress was not possible without the
opening of a new workfront, pressed the contractor to subcontract part of the
works. The contractor, in July 1979, followed MOPT's long-standing
recommendation and subcontracted works for an amount of about US$9.0 million
(13% of total costs). The Bank, in a letter dated November 5, 1979,
encouraged further transfer of works to subcontractors.
3.05      Progress seemed to improve for a short while, but the contractor
continued to have organizational weaknesses (it had four new technical
managers in a period of eight months) and soon began to develop problems with
its subcontractors as a result of non-payment. In January 1980, to prevent
further deterioration of the contractor's financial situation and eventual
work stoppage, MOPT undertook several measures: (a) reinstated the original
amount of advance payment, returning retention funds to the contractor
amounting to US$2.2 million; (b) mortgaged the construction equipment in
favor of MOPT for a total value of about US$15.0 million equivalent; (c) set
up direct control of the project's technical and financial management,3/ and
(d) agreed with the contractor to expand the scope of subcontracted works to
about 40% of the total cost of the contract.
3.06      By August 1981, however, a Bank mission found the technical and
financial management of the project in complete disarray. The situation was
further complicated by the devaluation of the local currency, during the
3/   The Public Works Director's opinion is that the actions taken by MOPT
were limited to keeping a tight monitoring of the contractor's financial
status (Letter, Annex 2D).

first quarter of 1981, from a fixed exchange rate of C. 8.54 to a floating
rate which initially fluctuated at about C. 17.00 to the US dollar.  In early
May 1981, the Costa Rican Central Bank requested the Bank to effect all
disbursements at the prevailing fluctuating rate, reducing dollar inflow from
Bank loans by 50%. On the other hand, the Government was bound by the
contract with the Venezuelan firm to pay 50% of the monthly statements at the
fixed rate of US$1 = C. 8.60 for the duration of the contract. Consequently,
the Bank's reimbursements provided only 60% of the dollars needed to pay the
contractor.4/ In May 1981, all payments in US dollars to the contractor
were stopped and the contractor's payments to the subcontractors, who, after
several false starts, were by then carrying out about 60% of the works, were
also affected.
3.07      On October 16, 1981, the Minister of Public Works and Transport
informed the Bank that MOPT had decided to *ancel the construction contract.
The reasons expressed, among others, were: (a) that the contract had expired,
only 60% of the programed works had been completed, and no work whatsoever
had been done on the 29 km of the Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo road; and (b) that
the lack of technical, managerial and financial capacity of the firm had
affected not only the fulfillment of its own responsibilities, but also the
performance of the subcontractors. At the same time, MOPT proposed, and the
Bank agreed, to resume the construction works through direct contracting with
the subcontractors, once the legal and technical requirements to close the
contract with the Ecuadorian firm had been completed. 'je reasons given in
favor of direct contracting were that: (a) the foreign subcontractors had
imported into the country specialized equipment for bridge and tunnel
construction; and (b) both foreign and local subcontractors had indicated to
MOPT their willingness to continue the works on the basis of the originally
contracted unit prices, increased by the established escalation system and,
in the case of the local contractors, paid only in local currency.
3.08      Before works could be resumed, however, the Borrower and the Bank
agreed that the following measures had to be taken:
(a)  completion of f.-nancial and technical audits of the original
contract;
(b) payment of outstanding debts to the subcontractors;
(c) authorization from the General Comptroller of the Republic to
proceed with the works under new contracts with the former
subcontractors;
(d) estimation of work quantities still to be executed on the different
road sections, bridges and the Zurqui tunnel; and
4/   Nevertheless, it should be noticed that the contractor was receiving
"double" compensation, first through a guaranteed exchange rate and
second through a price escalation formula reflecting the impact of the
devaluation on construction costs.



- 7 -
(e) preparation of new draft contract documents including adequate
price escalation adjustment provisions for all formerly
subcontracted sections and arrangements for tendering of one
section which had not been subcontracted previously.
3.09      Actions toward fulfillment of the conditions necessary to resume
civil works were slow, especially because of difficulties encountered in
assessing the work actually done and payments made to the original
contractor. These difficulties arose mostly from the lack of integration
among the different offices of MOPT involved in the task (financial,
technical and comptrollers) and the lack of proper technical and financial
records of the project. An out-of-court settlement with the Ecuadorian
contractor was reached only in August 1982, 5/ and MOPT started the process
of contracting the remaining works directly with the former subcontractors.
Contracts were signed between October 1982 and February 1983. In March 1983,
MOPT awarded,through local competitive bidding, a contract to a local firm
for the completion of the Zurqui Tunnel-Rio Sucio road section, the only road
section on which the original contractor was working before cancellation of
the contract. Works were resumed at various dates in late 1982 and early
1983. (Details of the contracts are presented in Annex 1).
3.10      Before the main contract was canceled, MOPT proposed to change the
alignment of a section of the road on the grounds that it would shorten the
length of the road and would obviate the need to build two main bridges and
two short tunnels. Although final engineering studies to support the change
were not yet ready and the advisory consultants did not concur with the
change, the Bark agreed with MOPT's proposal. The realignment, involving
about 27 km of road, was expected to save US$3.0 million, partially
offsetting cost increases caused by cost overruns in the construction of the
Zurqui tunnel and additional earthmoving and drainage works (estimated at the
time to be on the order of US$6.0 million). According to the original
alignment, the road was to descend to the flat areas through the left bank of
the Rio Sucio and, after crossing a bridge, to continue northward to
Siquirres. In the new alignment, the descent, after crossing the river, was
down its right bank. However, technical problems arose, and the new line had
to be changed again, being moved further away from the river bank.6/
5/   According to the settlement, MOPT was to pay all of the contractor's
bills for works done and submitted prior to the date of cancellation of
the contract.  The agreement also recognized that MOPT had advanced
payments to the contractor, and that an estimated difference of C. 12.0
million in favor of the contractor would be partially used to pay the
subcontractors. For damages, MOPT received from the contractor selected
equipment valued at about US$2.7 million. MOPT also received C. 42.0
million from the contractor's bonding company.
6/   On the other hand, MOPT's Director of Public Works feels that inadequate
engineering design hampered MOPT's efforts to carry out the project. He
states that without the changes in road alignment, induced by MOPT, the
project could not have been completed (Annex 2D).



-8-
3.11      In early 1983, when works were about to resume, it became evident
that, because of the sharp economic downturn in Costa Rica and the austerity
mer.aures taken in connection with the Government's stabilization policies, a
shortage of counterpart funds was going to further slow down project
implementation. In an effort to accelerate disbursements and/or restructure
projects to fit more closely the expected availability of local resources,7/
the Government and the Bank agreed to:
(a) reduce the size of an ongoing road rehabilitation program included
under the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 1845-CR) by about one half to
make it consistent with the expected financing possibilities;
(b) utilize US$10.3 million in loan funds freed from the Fifth Highway
Project to finance completion of the works in the San Jose -
Siguirres road. The Bank, at the same time, increased its
financing to cover 100% of the estimated foreign exchange costs
starting in mid-1983 (the disbursement percentage for civil works
was increased from 57% to 65%); and
(c) delete from the project the Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo branch road for
which works had not yet conmenced.8/
These changes, however, were not based on a reassessment of the relative
priorities in the country's public investment program.
3.12      The loan agreements for both the Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects
were revised accordingly on June 24, 1983, and the loan closing date for the
former was extended to June 30, 1984. Funds from Loan 1187-CR were fully
disbursed in July 1984, and project implementation continues with funds
provided by Loan 1845-CR.
3.13      Project supervision was also restructured before works resumed, and
the US-Costa Rican consulting joint venture, until then MOPT's advisors,
became fully responsible for the supervision of civil works.
3.14      Since mid-1983, works have proceeded without major problems, and
some road sections have already been opened to traffic. Works are expected to
be completed by mid-1985. However, a recent cost reevaluation shows cost
overruns that will have to be financed from treasury allocations to MOPT.
7/  At the end of 1982, US$38.2 million was estimated to be required to
complete the project (excluding the Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo road).
Assuming that only the then undisbursed portion of the loan
(US$13.1 million) would be available to help complete the project, the
Government's funding for 1984 would have had to increase substantially,
a development considered unlikely to materialize.
8/ At present, the Government is negotiating, with the Venezuelan
Investment Fund (VIF), financing for the construction of the branch
road, which is expected to be completed during 1986.



-9-
B. Project Supervision
3.15      As already mentioned, during the first phase of road construction,
MOPT itself was responsible for project supervision and retained the same
US-Costa Rican joint venture of consulting firms that had been involved in
project preparation to provide assistance but only in an advisory capacity.
This arrangement, which had worked satisfactorily in the previous
Bank-financed project, proved to be inadequate to deal with the complexity of
this project and the complications that arose during its implementation.
Project management was very weak both in its financial and technical
aspects. During the first phase of project execution, MOPT's project
accounting records were in disarray, and there was no sound, practical system
for recording and updating information. Also, there was a complete lack of
internal auditing over project execution. As a result, the formal closure
of the contract with the main contractor took about ten months and could not
be satisfactorily completed, mainly because of insufficient knowledge within
HOPT of the quantity of works performed and its correspondence with the
payments and advances made up to the time of contract cancellation. In
addition, when MOPT took over the technical and financial management of the
contractor's operations, the distinctive roles of the supervisor and the
contract works superintendent were confused. It was during this period that
MOPT changed, with Bank approval, the original alignment on part of the road,
although its justification raised serious doubts from the consultants
advising MOPT on supervision of the project. When the consultants assumed
full responsibility for supervision, the quality of supervision, as well as
the usefulness and timing of reporting, improved substantially.
C. Technical Assistance for Transport Planning
3.16      The technical assistance for transport planning financed under the
loan was provided by US consultants to MOPT's General Directorate of Planning
(GDP). The contract, for a period of 36 months in the amount of US$934,000
equivalent, was signed in July 1977. The consultants started their work on
September 19, 1977. The starting date represented a delay of 13 months over
the appraisal schedule and was the result of delays in the loan becoming
effective and delays in DGP assigning the necessary counterpart personnel,
because of competing claims upon its limited staff for preparation of the San
Jose Urban Project (para 3.19) and other studies not related to the loan.
3.17      Once the technical assistance got etarted, it proceeded smoothly
until the completion of its main task: a National Transport Plan upon which
the Bank commented favorably in early 1982.9/ Throughout their assignment,
the consultants maintained an excellent relationship with the Borrower; the
local counterparts participated actively in the preparation of the Plan and
benefited from the transfer of knowledge derived from such participation. As
a result, DGP now has a core of professionals able to assist the Government
in those transport investment decisions that are made on the basis of
economic rationale.
9/   Bank comments were made during supervision missions and while reviewing
the final draft with local authorities. It is not clear why the Bank's
written comment could have helped in winning acceptance of the report
conclusions from MOPT's officials, as suggested in GDP's letter
(Annex 2C).



- 10 -
3.18      The Plan iLtself continues to be partially updated to evaluate  the
limited investments that MOPT is undertaking in the sector. Besides the work
related to the Transport Plan, the consultants submiLted, in the course of
their assignment, several technical reports and memoranda intended to comple-
ment their training of DGP's personnel. These reports dealt with various
aspects of transport planning from data collection and review of actual
policies in the different transport modes, to methodologies, the use of
computerized systems, and policy revisions.
D. Technical Assistance for Urban Transport
3.19      The loan also provided funds for technical assistance to prepare an
Urban Transport Study for San Jose. The study was carried out by US consul-
tants and was completed satisfactorily in September 1977. It served as the
basis for the preparation of the San Jose Urban Transport Project         (Loan
1491-CR, US$16.5 million).
E. Installation and Operation of two Permanent Weighing Stations
3.20      The project included the establishment of two permanent weighing
stations, one on the San Jose-Mata de Cafe section of the project road, and
the other on the Siquirres-Limon highway. The station at Siquirres was com-
pleted in 1977 and became operational In 1978, although, at times,operations
were suspended for lack of personnel. Bank missions stressed the need to
strengthen weight controls in Siquirres and other stations in the country
and, since 1979, MOPT has allocated sufficient funds and personnel to improve
axle weight controls substantially . The station on the San Jose-Mata de
Cafe road section is expected to be built as part of the civil works of the
San Jose-Siquirres road.
F. Acquisition of Axle-Weighing Portable Scales, Vehicles and Equipment
3.21      The loan provided funds for the acquisition of five portable axle-
weighing scales as well as for vehicles and equipment needed for the supervi-
sion of the civil works under the project. Procurement of these items was
completed in early 1979 at a total cost of US$370,000.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison of appraisal estimates and estimated final costs is
shown in Table 1.   The final cost of the project is estimated at US$87.94
million, 31% above the appraisal estimate of US$ 66.9 million (excluding the
Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo road which was deleted from the project). Increases
in project costs with respect to appraisal estimates were mostly due to:
(a) 38% cost overrun in the civil works component which resulted from
increases in earthmoving works; (b) a delay of five years in project comple-
tion; (c) inflation rates above contingency allowances; and (d) to a certain
extent, the element of double-counting in price escalation adjustments



- 11 -
resulting from the contractual arrangement with the Ecuadorian contractor to
effect partial payments in US dollars at a fixed exchange rate and/or apply a
general price escalation to both local and foreign costs.
4.02      In addition to the Bank loan (US$39.0 million) and the allocation
of US$10.3 million from Loan 1845-CR, the foreign exchange cost of the
project was partially financed by a US$3.0 million loan from the OPEC Special
Fund and a US$14.0 million loan from the Venezuelan Investment Fund (VIF).
Both the OPEC Fund and VIF loans were fully disbursed by early 1981. In
August 1984, VIF approved a new loan for about US$1.4 million.
4.03      The allocation of loan funds was revised once, as shown in the
following table, mostly to assign unallocated funds to the civil works
category in order to meet cost increases.

4.04      Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates from the start
(Table 2), reflecting the slow pace of the construction works and the
considerable delays in completing them. Preference given to the early
disbursement of the OPEC Fund and VIF loans also slowed down the Bank loan
disbursements until 1980. The original disbursement percentages for civil
works and related consulting services of 100% of foreign expenditures and 57%
of total expenditures were increased to 100% of foreign expenditures and 65Z
of local expenditures in June 1983, when the project was revised and funds
from loan 1845-CR were assigned to it. Loan funds were fully disbursed on
July 16, 1984. Works are proceeding with financing provided by Loan 1845-CR
and a VIF loan of US$1.4 million that the Government secured In August 1984.

V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.01      The economic reevaluation of the San Jose-Siquirres highway yielded
an estimated economic rate of return (ERR) of 13%, as compared to the 18%
expected at appraisal. The economic reevaluation also showed that, contrary
to appraisal expectations, the San Jose-Guapiles and Guapiles-Siquirres road
sections are not individually justified and that the expected viability of
the project depends upon traffic using the whole length of the project road.
The lower-than-expected reestimated ERRs are mostly the result of a currently
expected traffic quite below the appraisal forecast (Table 3). However, the
reduction in estimated project benefits brought about by the conservative
traffic forecast used for the economic reevaluation was partially offset by
savings in vehicle operating costs substantially above those expected at
appraisal (Table 4). The estimated cost of the project, in real terms, was
in line with appraisal estimates. The cost-benefit streams are presented in
Table 5.
5.02      The main reasons for the substantial difference between the
appraisal traffic forecast and the traffic projections used in the economic
reevaluation are:
(a) The original economic evaluation was based on over optimistic
traffic growth projections. They were extrapolated from the
historic rates of the 1970s, which were in the 8%-10% per annum
range. However, because of Costa Rica's economic downturn
irn the early 1980s, traffic levels stagnated, and it is
unlikely that the previous growth rates will be resumed soon.
Therefore, the economic reevaluation is based upon a projected
traffic growth rate that varies from 4% to 5% per annum during
the lifetime of the project; and
(b) The appraisal estimated that substantial traffic would be
generated by the opening of new agricultural areas and by
increased economic activities as a result of the highway.
However, part of the project road traverses an area that has
already reached a high level of agricultural exploitation
(another section traverses a National Park). Also, deleting
the Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo road from the project (which might
have had a positive impact on the value added in agricultural
production, although probably quite below appraisal estimates)
reduced the possibility of a slightly higher traffic level on
the main road. Therefore, the economic reevaluation assumes a
traffic generation amounting to only 10% of the diverted
traffic. In the original evaluation, generated traffic
represented about 100% of the diverted traffic.
5.03      The benefits quantified for the economic reevaluation are mostly
savings in transport costs and passengers' time accruing to users of existing
road and rail links who are expected to divert to the project road (Table 6),
This traffic diversion was estimated as a function of the users' perceived
incentives (cost and time value) for the selection of a transport

in 1987. Ceilings on possible traffic diversion were identified on the basis
of traffic surveys carried out by MOPT on the existing San Jose-Siquirres
road (throughn Turrialba) and on an earth track linking Guapiles with
Siquirres. In the case of the railway, these ceilings were derived from the
1981 origin-destination studies included in the National Transport Plan and
were updated according to recent railway statistics. As in the original
evaluation, it was assumed that the transport of bananas (the only source for
large volumes of bulk traffic) will remain captive to the railway. Although,
in 1984, the amount of bananas transported by road doubled with respect to
1983 (mostly because of the present unsafe conditions of the railway branch
lines to plantations), the associated road traffic is still negligible.
5.04      The economic reevaluation, based upon estimates of quantifiable
benefits, confirms the justification, albeit marginal, of the project; the
expected returns are, however, well below appraisal estimates. The
reestimated rate of return is a conservative one since the project not only
will serve as a link between the capital city of San Jose and the Port of
Limon, but also will integrate areas which were previously poorly served.
The potential for the development of local traffic also seems important,
judging from the limited evidence available on the road section between
Siquirres and Guapiles.
VI. ROLE OF THE BANK
6.01      The Bank contributed significantly during project identification
and preparation, particularly through financing, reviewing and commenting
upon the feasibility and engineering studies. The project was well selected
since it represented a new high priority connection between the Atlantic and
Pacific Coasts, started under the Fourth Highway Project.
6.02      Project implementation suffered from serious problems that could
have been reduced had the Bank advised the Borrower of the advantages of
different implementation and supervision arrangements. With hindsight, the
Bank should have warned MOPT of the risks of entrusting the execution of a
large and rather complicated project to only one contractor, especially when
the bid evaluation documents explicitly stated that the contractor did not
have any previous experience with projects of the size of the San
Jose-Siquirres highway. Regarding project supervision, the Bank relied upon
its problem-free experience with the previous project and agreed that MOPT
would supervise the civil works, leaving only an advisory role to independent
consultants. This arrangement proved inadequate to deal with the
complexities inherent in and the problems arising from, the difficult and
problem-ridden project, and resulted in weak technical and financial
management of the works.10/
10/ Unlike the Siquirres-Limon road, financed under the Second Highway
Project, the San Jose-Siquirres road traverses very difficult
mountainous terrain, requiring the construction of major bridges and
tunnels.



- 14 -
6.03      Once it became evident that the Ecuadorian contractor was not
fulfilling its obligations properly, the Bank went along with most of MOPT
proposals to prevent slowing down the pace of works (i.e., monetary advances,
changes in road alignment and subcontracting of works), which were not always
adequately justified; however, the cleanr-cut solution of contract
cancellation and retendering of works was never advanced by the Bank.
6.04      After MOPT's cancellation of the original contract, the Bank was
helpful in setting the framework for an orderly resumption of works; in
addition, given the financial constraints that Costa Rica was experiencing at
the time, the Bank showed the necessary flexibility to allow the use of funds
from Loan 1845-CR so that the civil works project component could have
adequate financing.
VII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
7.01      The importance of the project to Costa Rica was recognized by the
successive Governments that were in office during project implementation.
However, poor technical management, the lack of adequate cost controls and
the dilution of the supervision authority complicated the problems arising
from the poor performance of the original contractor. MOPT adopted several
well intentioned measures with the objective of avoiding work stoppage and/or
cost increases of civil works, but they were mostly the result of proposals
and subsequent decisions made as a response to crisis situations. These
measures had only a short term effect, if any; they did not address the main
issues affecting project implementation and, in the end, did not achieve
their objective of avoiding a work stoppage and cost overrun.
7.02      During project preparation, the Government and the Bank were
concerned about the possible disruption of the ecosystem of the rain forest
in the area of the project. As a result, the Government requested the Centro
Cientifico Tropical (CCT) to carry out a special study on the matter. The
ensuing report concluded that the existing forest cover had to be preserved
in order to contain erosion, regulate waterflows and preserve wild flora and
fauna, and it made specific recommendations regarding construction of the
project. Based upon this information, the Government altered the design of
the project before it was appraised. In 1977, some local and international
conservation societies approached the Bank to express their concern about the
possible negative impact of the project. Subsequent Bank supervision
missions pointed out, to MOPT and to the supervision advisory consultants,
the need to give greater care to the cuts in the mountainous watershed area
and to the selection of disposal areas for rubble and waste materials.
Meanwhile, the Government took other, more extensive measures to safeguard
the central mountains.      On April 5, 1978 a decree was issued whereby a
national park was established in the watershed area to help protect the
natural forest cover against exploitation, and budgetary provisions were made
for the necessary force to patrol the new park. In addition, on June 16,
1978, the Government established a high level commission to analyze and
recommend measures to solve all problems arising from the construction of the
project road. The commission concluded that there was no scientific proof to
indicate that, with proper surveillance and protective measures, the project
would have any negative effects upon the area's ecological system.



- 15 -
7.03      MOPT did not carry out its project supervision responsibilities in
a satisfactory manner. The lack of records for work performed, or for
payments made to the origiual contractor, prompted the Bank to request, after
works came to a standstill, a complete technical and financial audit of the
project, a task that, after almost ten months, was not possible to complete
because of the dramatic disarray of the project management. When MOPT took
over the technical and financial management of the contract, the distinction
between the roles of supervision and project construction superintendent
became blurred. It was at this point that MOPT designed and started to
implement, with Bank approval, a first major change in the road alignment
that had to be revised subsequently because of geological problems. The
advisory consultants did not agree with the change, on the grounds that final
engineering studies to support its merits were not available. Despite the
lack of consensus on the realignment, MOPT, with Bank approval, went ahead
with it. The savings expected from the change in line did not materialize,
since this road section experienced substantial cost overruns because of
increases in the physical quantities of worka.
7.04      The Borrower's performance with respect to transport planning was
mixed. The Borrower was instrumental in the success of the technical
assistance for transport planning, through the creation of the planning
office and the provision of local counterpart staff, which has undoubtedly
developed MOPT's planning capabilities. However, one major problem continues
to hamper the Planning Office efforts: transport planning is not related to
budget preparation and execution; consequently, the advice from the planning
staff, if not taking place after decisions are made, is often overridden by
other than economic considerations.   Moreover, highway investments and those
of public enterprises in charge of the Costa Rican railways and ports
continue to be made without coordination, and many have dubious
justification.
7.05      As mentioned in paragraph 2.04, the loan agreement obligated the
Borrower to carry out investments in its transport sector on the basis of
adequate studies demonstrating the economic justification of such
investments. This obligation originated in the Bank's concern about possible
unjustified investments in the Atlantic Railway.  In compliance, the Borrower
did carry out a study of the economic feasibility of the electrification of
the railway and gave the Bank the opportunity to review it. The Bank
questioned the study critically and insisted that the use of more realistic
assumptions would lead to the conclusion that investments in the railway were
unjustified.  However, the Borrower did not agree with the Bank's comments,
and the investments were carried out on the main line of the Atlantic
Railway.
7.06      The Borrower was also required by the Loan Agreement to submit to
the Bank, by January 1, 1977, a plan and timetable for the implementation of
a feeder road system within the area of influence of the project road.
Although with some delay, the Borrower complied with this covenant. In early
1982, MOPT completed the construction of 39 km of asphalt surfaced roads and
70 km of gravel roads in the area of influence of the San Jose-Siquirres
road.



- 16 -
7.07      Adequate road maintenance and axle load control of trucks were
subjects of staadard covenants included in the loan agreement.  The
Borrower's performance regarding road maintenance continues to be inadequate,
and the primary network is deteriorating rapidly. The Fifth Highway Project
is addressing these issues, but the lack of a firm conviction, on the part of
the Government, on the need to improve its maintenance operations causes
progress to be limited. With respect to axle load control, MOPT's efforts
have resulted in considerable improvements. Early in the project
implementation period, Bank missions brought to the attention of MOPT the
fact that sporadic checks of axle loads were ineffective. MOPT increased
its budgetary allocation to permit personnel to be available around the clock
in its weighing stations, and evidence suggests that overloading has
diminished considerably. These efforts were supported by the project through
the financing of weighing scales.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project was successful in providing Costa Rica with a needed
road to complete another connection between its capital city and the Atlantic
coast at Puerto Limon. In addition, the technical assistance included in the
project created a core of transport planning professionals who provide the
potential for enhancing the planning capabilities of MOPT. The main
weaknesses that continue to affect the highway subsector relate to what seems
to be the lack of commitment, on the part of the Government, to make
effective use of its planning capacity during the investment decision process
and to address the problem of inadequate road maintenance in a meaningful
manner.
8.02      Experience gathered during project implementation suggest that the
following lessons can be learned:
(a)  The process of pre-qualification and bid evaluation should not be
limited to the routine review of documents presented by the
candidates. The executing agency, with Bank assistance, should go
further into the investigation of past performance of the
candidates and, what is more important, should inquire about the
existence of other projects being carried out by the proposed
awardee that may possibly tax its future financial capabilities.
(b)  In contract packaging, the trade off between economies of scale and
diversification of risk should be weighed carefully. In
retrospect, it is evideat that the San Jose-Siquirres road was a
project too large and difficult to be entrusted to only one
contractor, particularly to one that had no previous experience
with projects of the magnitude of the San Jose-Siquirres highway.
(c)  Project supervision should be designed in a way in which
responsibilities and accountability are clearly defined; in
general, this is better accomplished by independent consultants
who are, at least, contractually responsible for eneuring that the
contract is implemented according to approved technical



- 17 -
and administrative specifications. In this project, consultants
were retained strictly in an advisory role. Their advice, provided
only on request, was seldom followed.
(d) The Bank should have considered, much earlier, the logical
alternative of advising the Borrower to cancel the original
contract and retender the works, rather than going along with (when
not actually encouraging) measures in response to crisis situations
that did not achieve even palliative solutions for the contractorts
weaknesses. Among these measures, the following merit some
comments:
(i) Excessive subcontracting: the inordinate amount of
subcontracting that took place defeated the purpose of the
prequalification process, since the originally selected firm
became an intermediary for firms which might not have
prequalified on their own. On the positive side,
subcontracting provided local contractors with the experience
of working in a difficult project. Their performance was, in
general, good.
(ii)  MOPT's Takeover of the Contractor's Technical and Fi ancial
Mangement:, MOPT's actions in this regard hampered project
implementation. It was a case not only in which a weak,
unorganized superviaor took control of a trouble-ridden
tonstruction project but also in which specific
responsibilities became further diffused.
(iii) Change in road alignment:  in part a by-product of the
overlapping roles that emanated from (ii) preceding, this
measure should not have been approved by the Bank without the
final supporting studies being ready. The fact that the
decision on the change in alignment did not generate consensus
among MOPT staff and the consultants should have warned the
dank that such a decision required further in-depth
consideration;
(e) The substantial know-how transfer that resulted from the technical
assistance for planning demonstrates that the success of this type
of exercise is critically dependent upon the establishment of a
working relationship between expatriates and their local
counterparts that requires the latter to be active participants in
achieving the objectives.
(f)  Bank projects should aim not only at strengthening the planning
capabilities of the Botrower but also at ensuring that those
capabilities will be effectively used in the investment decision
making process. Planning should be institutionalized and become an
integral part of the budget preparation exerciae.



- 18 -
(g)  The loan covenant regarding investments in the transport sector to
which the Bank finally agreed was inadequate to achteve its main
purpose: preventing uneconomic investments in the electrification
of the Atlantic Railway. In future projects, when the same type of
problem is foreseen, the Bank should not rely upon promises that
subsequent Governments do not have to honor, or upon obligations in
loan agreements that can be interpreted in ways that circumvent the
intended purpose.
(h) An economy-wide shortage of counterpart funds should have prompted
the Government to reassess the priorities in its investment
program. However, this was not done; the shift of funds from the
road rehabilitation works under the Fifth Highway Project to the
completion of the San Jose-Siquirres road was based on ad-hoc
considerations.

Dear Sir:
I have reviewed the report and in general my opinion is very
favorable. I find it most objective and it contains very important
observations that should be taken into consideration in future projects in
order to improve the administration of same.
The sole correction I would like to suggest is that wherever
reference is made to a "Venezuelan" firm, this should read "Ecuadorian,"
because the firm "Monolitica S.A." is in fact Ecuadorian.

Mr. Yukinori Watanabe
Director, Operations Evaluation Department
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Dear Sir:
We acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 3, 1985, by which
you requested our comments regarding the Completion Report on the Fourth
Highways Project (Loan 1187-CR), a copy of which you also kindly sent us.
We now have much pleasure in forwarding to you our observations on
aspects relating to the technical assistance component for transportation
planning provided, through the project, to the Directorate General of Planning
(DGP) of the Ministry of Public Works and Transportation (MOPT).
In general terms we concur with the conclusions of the report, which
found that the project was successful in strengthening MOPT's planning
capacity and that the active participation of the DGP counterpart personnel
played a fundamental role in the accomplishment of the aims of the technical
assistance for transportation planning.
Regarding the execution of this technical assistance (paragraph 3.16
of the report), it might be added that the extending of the duration of
contract from 36 to 51 months, i.e. by 42%, at an increase in cost of only
112, from $933,000 to $1,038,000, also greatly benefited the transfer of
knowledge from the consultants to the DGP counterpart personnel. In addition,
it should be made clear that DGP is not a recent creation within MOPT, as
stated in paragraph 3.16. In actual fact, it began operations thirty years
ago as a planning unit, being admittedly limited at first to the highways
subsector, although with the passage of time it also assumed responsibilities
in other modes until Decree No. 4956-T of June 25, 1975 finally made DGP the
sectoral planning office for the transportation sector.
Our active participation in the preparation of the National
Transportation Plan, completed at the end of the technical assistance after
more than four years of very detailed studies, meant that we could attest that
the plan was based on extensive research with a global approach and a rigorous
technical and economic analysis applying very high standards. We accordingly
consider this study to be the most complete and reliable of those made to date
on the Costa Rican transportation sector. While we assume that the Bank
shares this view, we are not aware of the favorable comments made by it
according to the report (paragraph 3.17) at the beginning of 1982. We are
sure that if the Bank had forwarded to us a document with those favorable
observations, this would have helped greatly toward winning acceptance of the



32-                           ANNEX 2
*Psge 6 of 15
report's conclusions and recommendations on the part of the Government
authorities and, especially, the officials responsible for the transportation
sector.
We agree with the reporc on the need for better integration and
coordination of plans and programs in the transportation sector
(paragraph 7.04). Certainly despite some recent steps such as creation of
what is termed the Transportation and Public Works Sector (Decree No. 1433-T
of February 25, 1983), it must be admitted that no system has yet been
developed that adequately coordinates and integrates the different modes and
institutions involved in transportation and made effective use of the planning
capacity of MOPT as the overall authority for the transportation sector.  We
also believe that for the future, Bank projects ought to be aimed both at
strengthening and modernizing MOPT's planning capability, and at ensuring that
this capability is utilized effectively in the formulation of Investment
programs in the transportation sector.
Finally, one point of detail: in the table in Annex I to the
report, under item C.2 (Consultant Services/Transportation Planning), in the
column "Value according to Contract", the figures 236, 802 and 1937 are given
for local currency, foreign exchange and total respectively. However,
according to our data, the correct amounts (in US$ thousands) are 155 (local
currency), 778 (foreign exchange) and 933 (total).
We remain at your disposal, should you require any further
clarifications.
Yours sincerely,

Estinado sefior:
Acusamos recibo de su carta de fecha 3 de diciembre de 1985, en la que
solicita nuestros comentarios en relaci6n con el InfoTm de Conclusidn
del Cuarto Proyecto de Carreteras (Pr6stam 1187-CR), copia del cual
tambi8n usted tuvo la amabilidad de hacernos llegar.
Al respecto con mwiho gusto le estamDs remitiendo nuestras observacio-
nes sobre aspectos conceTnientes con el componente de asistencia t&cni
ca para la planificaci8n del transporte suministTada, por medio del
mismo Proyecto, a la Direccidn General de Planificacidn (DGP) del 4DPT.
En terminos generales estamos de acuerdo con las conclusiones del In-

cidn activa del personal de contraparte de la DGP jug6 un papel funda-
mental en el logro de los objetivos de la asistencia t6cnica para la
planificaci&i del transporte.
Con respecto a la ejecucidn de esta Mltima asistencia t6cnica (pdrrafo
3.16 del Informe) podria agregarse que la extensi6n de la duracidn del
contrato de 36 a 51 meses, o sea en un 42%, con un incremento en el
costo de solamente un 11%, de $933 000 a $1 038 000, tambi&n beneficid
considerablemente la transferencia de conocimientos de los consultores
al personal de contraparte de la DGP. Por otra parte, debemos aclarar
que esta Direcci6n General no es de reciente creaci6n en el NDPT, como
se indica en el mis'o pfrrafo 3.16. En efecto, comenz6 a funcionar

la misma DGP se le otorg6 el carkter de oficina sectorial de planifica-

Nuestra participacidn activa en las tareas del plan nacional de tnmspor

plan se bas6 en una extensa investigacidn con enfoque global y en un ri-
guroso anglisis tecnoecondmico de nozmas muy elevadas. Por eso consi-
deramos que ese estudio es el rds completo y confiable de los hasta ahora
realizados, sobre el sector transporte de la economla costarricense.
Aunaque suponemos que el Banco comparte este criterio, no conocemns las
observaciones favorables que seg6n el Informe (pfrrafo 3.17) formuld6 a
comienzos de 1982. Estamos seguros de que si el Banco nos hubiese remiti
do un docuamnto con esas observaciones favorables, habria prestado una
contribuci6n muy significativa a la aceptacidn de las conclusiones y re-
comendaciones de ese plan, por los funcionarios del Gobierno y, particu-
larmente, los del sector transporte.
Goncordanms con el Informe en lo que se refiere a la necesidad de lograr
una mejor integracidn y coordinaciCn de los planes y programas en el sec
tor transporte (pkrafo 7.04). Ciertamente, a pesar de algunos esfuerzos
recientes como la creacidn del llamado Sector Transporte y Obras Pdblias
(Decreto N01433-T del 25 de febrero de 1983), hay quo reconocer que toda-
via no se ha logrado desarrollar un sistema que coordine e integre adecua
damente los distintos medios e instituciones que intervienen en el trans-
porte, y que aproveche con mayor eficacia la capacidad de planificaci&n
del MNPT como 6rgano rector del sector transporte. Taibidn creemrs quo
para el futuro, los proyectos del Banco deberfan estar dirigidos tanto a
fortalecer y actualizar la capacidad de planificacidn del NDPT, cow  a
asegurar que esa capacidad se aproveche efectivamente en el proceso de
fornmlacin de programas de inversiones en el sector transporte.
Por d1timD,una observaci6n de frnma:  En el cuadro del Anexo 1 del Infor-

te), bajo la columna "Valor segdn el contrato"   aparecen las cifras 236,

embargo, de acuerdo con los datos on nuestro poder, los montos correctos
(en miles de d6lares) son 155 (meneda nacional), 778 (divisas). y 933

Subject:  Your letter of December 3, 1985 regarding the
Completion Report on the Fourth Highway Project
(Loan 1187-CR)
Dear Mr. Watanabe:
In response to your request I would like to convey to you our views
on the Completion Report on the Fourth Highways Project, specifically as
regards the physical execution of the Siquirres-San Jos6 Highway. I would
like to make it clear that we agree with the financial aspects of the report;
the purpose of these comments is to emphasize the true cause of the
difficulties concerning execution, which prevented the works from being
completed with the resources and within the deadline planned. In our view two
very important factors hampered proper execution of the works, namely:
1.   Inadequatc construction studies and plans;
2.   Selection of the contractor, in which more researcb and care were
required.
Everything that prejudiced the completion of the works stems from
these two factors. As regards the former, it should be noted that this
Ministry (MPWT) was obliged to redesign works which supposedly had been fairly
well studied. Not only did the Ministry have to change a part of the original
route; it was also obliged to make a series of adjustments and corrections in
order to avoid the corstruction of gigantic walls and bridges (for example,
the Ventana bridge and the Coronel bridge). I must categorically state that
without these alterations and changes the project could not have been
completed. The mountain section was not studied carefully and it was
impossible to construct a single one of the walls stipulated in the plans,



ANNEX 2
37 -                        Page ll of l5
since the real conditions of the terrain were never the same as those shown in
the plans; Certainly we must take a large share of the responsibility for
this. As a Ministry we should not have accepted these plans without making
proper checks. We placed too much confidence in the US/Costa Rica consulting
consortium and we did not use well-tried systems that would have ensured the
quality of the work. As a result of this experience we have been working on
improving the organization of MPWT, and we will also work to improve the
attitude of our consultants, since development projects must be joint efforts,
involving a great deal of communication, if situations are to be avoided that
benefit nobody.
The fact that time that should have been devoted to supervision had
to be spent on redesigning the works while they were in progress, dealing with
a low-quality contractor, arranging subcontracts and trying to establish good
relations and good communications with the advisory consortium, which had to
be made to understand that it was working for the Ministry, may have had
effects on the quality of the supervision, but not on the physical difficulty
of the works, as suggested on pages 15 and 16, paragraph 6.02, of the report.
As regards the selection of the coaitractor, the MPWT made the very
serious mistake of following the recommendation of the same consulting group,
and awarded the entire works to a single contractor. Furthermore, the
contractor was not sufficiently investigated to ascertain whether it was
capable of implementing a contract of this size; when it became necessary to
execute the performance bond Government officials encountered numerous
difficulties, which almost made it impossible to collect payment. The
contractor was never properly organized, in technical and administrative
terms, to handle the project. This led to pressure on the contractor to
subcontract part of the works to local firms of proven ability. The good
results achieved through the first subcontracts led the Government to expand
these subcontracting arrangements, the idea being that the subcontractors
would finish the work, thereby avoiding the costly delays that would be caused
by a cancellation of the original contract. This Ministry never at ary time
took over the technical and financial administration of the works, since such
"intervention" was not a possible solution in this case, not only because of
the laws of Costa Rica, but because of the terms of the contract for execution
of the works. There was indeed strong pressure from the Government on the
company to establish tight financial controls, rigorous accounting and strict
control of cash flows, using company personnel. The Government never had
Ministry personnel administering Monolitica funds. Unfortunately, the very
bad management by the contractor obliged the Government to cancel the
contract. By this time the subcontracts were going very well as a result of
the good performance of the subcontractors, but it was already impossible to
continue with the main company.
Finally, we would like to emphasize the importance attached by the
Government of Costa Rica to the completion of this work. The changes referred
to in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) on page 9 of the report did indeed represent
a top priority, and this is the significance of the project for Costa Rica.
We also believe that this was the only way to continue with a project which
was in danger of coming to a standstill.

issues; we could if necessary expand on these comments and go into much
greater detail, but we will leave this for another occasion and only, of
course, if you consider it necessary.

obras giran alrededor de esos dos factores. Con respecto al primer factor,
cabe mencionar que ol MOPT se vio obligado a dosarrollar un rediseSo sobre un
trabajo que supuestamente estaba rasonablemente bien estudiado, asi, no sole-
mente el NOPT cambi'o parte del trasado original, sino que necesariamente lle-
v'o a cabo una serie de ajustes y correcciones que evito la construccion de
muros gigantescos, y puentes (caso de puente Ventana y puente Coronel). Cabe
afirmar categ'oricamente que sin estoe ajwustes y cambios el proyecto no se po-
dia llevar a feliz t'ermino. La seociron monta?osa no fue cuidadosamente estu-
diada y fue imposible colocar un solo muro de los estipulados en planos, de-
bido a que las verdaderas condiciones del terreno mnuca se asemejaron a las
mostradas en planos. Por supuesto que en esto tenemos una gran cuota de res-
ponsabilidad. Nosotros como Ministerio fallamos al aceptar dichos planos sin
un control adecuado.   Hubo demasiada confianza en el Consorcio Consultor
Norteamericano-Costarricense y no se establecieron sistemas bien prc'ados que
permitieran asegurar la calidad del trabajo. Como fruto de esa experiencia,
hemos trabajado en mejorar la organizacion del MOPT  y trabajaremos en cam-
biar positivamente la mentalidad de nuestros consultores, ya que los proyeo-
tos de desarrollo deben de trabajarse en conjunto y con mucha comunicaciAn,
de esta forma se evitar'an situaciones que ha nadie benefician.

La dispersiZon de tiempo de la supervisiBn al tener que redisenar
sobre la marche, tratar con un contratista de mala calidad, promover subcon-
tratos y eaforzarse en lograr armomna y buena comunicaciSn con el consorcio
asesor que por su parte debe entender que trabaja "para" el Ministerio, es
posible que haya incidido sobre la calidad de la supervision, no la dificul-
tad fisica de la obra como se da a entender en la Peg. 15 y 16, articulo 6.02
de su informe.
Entremos ahora a analisar el segundo factor, o sea ia selecei'on del
contratista.  El Ministerio de Obras Publicas cometio el gravisimo error de
seguir la recomendacon del mismo grupo consultor-asesor, adjudicando la to-
talidad de la obra a un solo contratista. Adem's, el contratista no fue de-
bidamente investigado para los alcances de un contrato. de esa magnitud, cuan-
do se hizo necesario ejecutar el bono de cumplimiento, lee funcionarios del
gobierno encontraron moultiples dificultades quo por poco imposibilitan sU co-
bro.   La organizacion del contratista nusca tuvo la capacidad t'cnico-
administrativa suficiente para manejar el proyecto. Esto origin'e las prosio-
nes hacia el contratista para que subcontratara parte de aU trabajo con em-
presas locales de reconocida capacidad. Los buenos resultados obtenidos con
los primeros subcontratos estimularon al gobierno a promover una subcontrata-
cion mayor, y la idea fue que le0  subcontratistas terminaran la obra, asi, se
evitarian costosasi demoras que ocasionarja la cancelaciUn del contrato origi-
nal.  El Ministerio no asumi'  en ningun momento la administraci'bn tecnica y
financiera de la obra, ya quo la "intervencion" no es solucion aplicable en
este case debido a las leyes de Costa Rica, y de acuerdo al contrato para la
ejecuciron de las obras, lo que ai existio fue una fuerte presion del gobierno
para que la empresa estableciera estrictos controles financieros, estricta
contabilidad y un estricto control del flujo de eaja con personal de la misma
empresa. El gobierno nunca tuvo personal del NOPT administrando fondos de
Monolitica.   Desafortunadamente la p'esima administraciEon del contratista
obligaron al gobierno a dar por cancelado el contrato. A esas alturaa los
subcontratos marchaban muy bien, era notoria ia buena labor de lo  subcontra-
tistas, pero era ya materialmente imposible seguir con la empresa principal.
Como comentario final queremos destacar la importancia que tiene
pars el gobierno de Costa Rica la terminaci'bn de esta obra, lo cambios que
se hicieron y que se comentan en los apartes a) b) y c) de la p`&gina 9 de su
informe, si respondieron a una gran prioridad cual es la significancia de
esta obra para nuestro pais, y creemos que esa fue la Ounica solucion para
darle continuidad a un proyecto que estaba en peligro de estanearse.
