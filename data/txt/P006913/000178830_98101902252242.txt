REPORT ANP RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESI'DENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA
FOR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Costa Rica for the equivalent of US$39.0 million
for a fourth highway project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including a grace period of five years, with interest at 8-1/2 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Report of Costa Rica" (No. 360-CR)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 15, 1974 (R74-loo). In
December 1974 an updating economic mission visited Costa Rica.   The principal
findings of this mission, as supplemented by brief missions which visited
Costa Rica in March and July 1975, are summarized in the following paragraphs.
A memorandum on the current economic situation and prospects of Costa Rica will
be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly. lnnex I summarizes the
main economic and social indicators.
3.        Costa Rica provides a rare example among developing countries of
how high per capita income growth may be achieved without an undue concen-
tration of development benefits in the upper income ;groups. A high level
of investment and rapid export growth allowed real ouatput to grow at about
6.3 percent yearly between 1965 and 1974, while family planning efforts and
rising educational and income levels contributed to a sharp decline in the
population growth rate from 4h0 percent in 1960 to 2.6 percent at present.
Consequently, real output per capita grew at 3.4 peyent per year during
1965-74 and per capita GNP in 1973 reached US$710.0-..
4.        Agriculture continues to be the most important sector of the
economy, generating about two-thirds of the country'3 foreign exchange
earnings. Agricultural output has increased fairly rapidly in recent years,
especially as a result of Government policies to increase exports principally
of bananas and beef. Four products (coffee, bananas, beef and sugar) made up
about 64 percent of merchandise export earnings in 1974 while 20 years earlier
only two commodities - coffee and bananas - accounted for 85 percent of exports.
Rapid industrial growth was made possible as a result of the creation of the
Central American Common Market (CACM) and the favorable economic conditions
resulting from the growth of agricultural exports. Recently, especially in
1974, industrial exports to the CACM and Panama have grown at a very high rate.

5.        The public sector has for long played a vital role in Costa
Rica's development process. The Government has given substantial attention
in recent years to improving the country's basic infrastructure such as
highways, feeder roads and the development of the hydroelectric potential
of the country. Substantial emphasis is placed on the opening up of new
areas for settlement and cultivation.   At the same time, the Government has
provided a wide range of public services. About half of the expenditures
of the Central Government have traditionally been in education, health,
nutrition and other social sectors. Health and nutrition programs have
been an important factor in reducing mortality rates from 9 per thousand
in the early 1960's to the present 6 per thousand. On the other hand, by
spending almost a third of its budget on education, the Central Government
has been able to improve coverage and quality of primary and secondary
schools, reduce illiteracy to a minimum and provide a good quality univer-
sity education. A new initiative enacted by the Government in 1975 is
the "Family Assistance Program" which is designed to increase the living
standards of the poorest rural families representing about one fourth of
the pop-ulation.  The program includes, among others, rural health, sani-
tation, housing and education projects, as well as nutrition programs for
pre-school and school-age children and will be financed primarily through a
recently passed payroll tax and an increase in the sales tax rate.    Costa Rica
has no standing army, and the share of Central Government expenditures devoted
to security - 2.3 percent in 1974 - has long been one of the lowest in the world.
6.        Since 1972, w1hen the current expenditures of the Central Govern-
men-, exceeded current revenues, the public financial situation has improved
substantially. The Government has increased tax revenues through compre-
hensive fiscal reforms, including changes in the income tax law, increases
in sales and consumption taxes, introduction of ad valorem export taxes and
administrative improvements in tax collections. Therefore, with moderate
increases in Government expenditures, public savings increased and the
overall public sector deficit was reduced from 3.8 percent of GDP in
1972 to 2.2 percent in 197h.
7.        The balance of payments, however, deteriorated substantially during
1974 while inflation - domestically induced and imported - accelerated. Where-
as exports expanded at a high rate of 26 percent, both through volume and price
increases, imports grew about twice as fast.    The major factors underlying the
rapid import growth include a sharp rise in import prices, an expansionary
credit policy and an inventory build-up. Import prices, led by oil, are estimated
to have risen by 30 percent during 1974 versus an estimated 15 percent growth in
export prices. The attempt to maintain a rising level of aggregate demand
in spite of the loss of income due to adverse terms of trade was possible only
through substantial foreign borrowing, a large part of it on commercial terms,
and through reserve losses. The country's financial difficulties in 1974 were
reflected in a deficit on current account of US$270.0 million or 16 percent
of GIJP. By December 31, 1974, net international reserves were estimated at
U3't15.d million (not including a US$22.7 million drawing from the IMF oil facility)
or less than ten days imports. At the same time, the rate of inflation (measured



-3-
by the consumer price index), which averaged 3.L percent per year during 1966-'2,
reached 15 percent in 1973 and 30 percent in 1974. Part of the explanation for
the change in internal price trends has been the recent rise in import prices,
but monetary expansion must bear part of the responsibility.
8.        The Government responded to these growing pressures in late 1974 and
early 1975, with a number of measures designed to stem the growth of imports
and encourage exports. Restrictions on installment crsdit for consumer durables
were introduced, and consumption and sales taxes were increased. Higher support
prices for basic grains were established to encourage import substitution. A
general reduction in export taxes took place in response to deteriorating worlcd
market prices for several traditional export commodities, and, in the case of
manufactured products, to offset the difference betweena domestic inflation and
inflation in the major export markets.
9.        These measures were largely successful.   The growth of imports slowed
down noticeably during the first few months of 1975, while manufacturirg indus-
tries' inventories of imported goods remained high. Moreover, import orders
as of July 15, 1975 indicate a further decline in import growth, and, if
present trends continue, imports during the whole ox 1775 should be about equal
to the 1974 level in current terms and decline in real terms. Largely because
of low coffee prices, export earnings were only about v percent larger during
the first five months of 1975 than in the same period a year ago. The recent
increase in coffee prices is not expected to help Costa Rica's earnings
significantly during 1975 as all of this year's crop has already been sold,
except for about 10-20 percent which was part of a retention scheme to be
financed by Venezuela. On the other hand, current indications are that the
basic grains program, initiated early this year, will be very successful: im-
ports of corn and beans will be much reduced from last year and a substantial
export surplus of rice is likely to develop. For the whole of 1975 export
earnings are expected to be 15 percent above 1974. On the basis of the above
trends, Costa Rica's current account deficit during 1975 will most likely be
reduced from its 1974 level to about US$210.0 million, or about 10.5 percent
of GDP.
10.       The reduction in imports is not expected to have a substantial effect
on output growth during 1975 because of the existence of large inventories:
real output is expected to grow at about 6 percent. Tle rate of inflation,
however, remains high, even though official estimates indicate a decline from
30 percent during 197)4 to a yearly rate of 23 percent during the first half of
1975. Domestic credit expansion also was rapid during the first five months
of 1975 largely because credit for export and basic grains production are not
subject to ceilings in the monetary program. The Central Bank has recently imposed
strict limits on its reciscount facilities, and credit expansion has slowed
considerably since the middle of the year.
11.       The developments in the trade balance during early 1975 are an
encouraging indication that the Costa Rican authoritie3 will be able to
overcome the immediate balance of payments difficulties: they will be
aided in this effort by the prospect of a substantial increase in export
earnings in 1976 because' of higher cofee prices    Over the longer 'erm a
substantial effort towards industnialization, selective import aubstltu-
tion and export diversifica4tion must fonm the basis for' an ircrsaSed GDP
growth rate and a strengthened bialance or oayrment's  To this end a major efo-rt



towards export promotion has been initiated. Currently exports of non-
traditional products to non-Central American Common Market countries are
promoted through a tax rebate scheme equivalent to 15 percent of the FOB
value; markceting outlets are being established in several countries in
the Caribbean; an export development fund is to be created in the rear
future and preferential interest rates are accorded to production for
export; also, a substantial expansion of hotel facilities is taking place
to promote the tourism industry.
12.       Assuming that the actions taken to overcome the short-run
difficulties are continued and the efforts to diversify and strengthen
the export sector over the longer term are successful, Costa Rica will
remain creditworthy for the substantial amounts of foreign borrowing envisaged
by the Government to implement its development program. The public debt
service ratio has fluctuated around 10 percent during the last few years.
The high level of commercial oorrowing auring 15V14 is expected to lead to a
substantial increase in debt service payments.  The authorities have,
however, since early 1975, made a firm decision to keep such borrowing under
control and, assuming export promotion policies are suecessful, the public
debt service ratio would rise to no more than 14-15 percent by 1980.
13.       Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided principally
by USAID, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). USAID has been active
mainly in agriculture, road maintenance and construction, and health.
IDB has been financing mainly agricultural and industrial credit, water
supply, housing,-feeder roads, power generation and rural electrification,
and vocational and agricultural education. CABEI is active in financing
projects which have a regional impact, principally in transport, industry,
iuower and telecommunications. The lending of these agencies in recent
years (through the end of i974) is summarized below (net of cancellations):

While the three rmajor lenders--IBRD, IDB and CABEI-- have loaned comparable
amounts to date, this results from sharply increased lending by IDB and CABEI
during the last few years. During the 1960's Bank lending substantially
exceeded tIe levels of IDB and CABEI lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Costa Rica has received to date eighteen Ban'k loans and one IDA
credit, totalling US$194.5 million, net of cancellations0 The last operation,
a loan for a power project amounting to US$h1.0 million, was signed on June 16,
1975. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and
IUC investments, as of October 31, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
15.       As of December 31, 1974, the Bank Group held 22.4 percent of the
US$454.O million external public debt outstanding--including undisbursed--
repayable in foreign currency.  This share is likely to decrease by 1980
because of an expected increase in the activity of other external lenders.
The Bank Group share of total public debt.service in 1971 is estimated at 14.9
percent.
16.        Since in the past other lenders were able to provide Costa Rica with
substantial amounts of concessional lending, which the Government preferred to
use for its socially oriented investments, the main thrust of the Bank's past
lending has been to help develop basic infrastructure, such as power, tele-
communications and highways. However, the Bank has also supported efforts to
increase and diversify exports through lending for agricultural credit and has
helped make educational programs more consistent with manpower objectives
through a loan for secondary and vocational education. Over the next few years,
and given Costa Rica's impressive longer-term record of rapid growth combined
with steadily improving income distribution, we intenc to support the main
elements of the Government's public investment program. This will mean that,
while power and transport will absorb a lesser share cf our total lending to
Costa Rica than in the past, they will nevertheless re!present the two most
important sectors in terms of lending amount. In lending for these sectors
we will not only be supporting Government investment priorities but will also
be building on past efforts to help improve the efficiency and savings capacity
of sectoral institutions.
17.        Given the vulnerability of Costa Rica's balance of payments, we
intend to give increased emphasis to assisting in the financing of export-oriented
industry and agriculture. In addition, in order to help expand exports, par-
ticularly those with a high percentage of local value added, the Bank is consi-
dering the possibility of participating in the financing of, and in mobilizing
additional external resources for, the large Boruca hydro-electric project which
is designed primarily to supply the power requirements of a proposed aluminum
complex. Through proposed loans in rural development and agriculture and compo-
nents of projects in infrastructure development, we would help to support the
Government's efforts to raise the productivity and employment capacity of the
farming sector and to reduce further the income and welfare dfisparities between



-6-
urban and rural areas. In our lending activities in Costa Rica, we will con-
tinue to coordinate closely with IDB, USAID and the Central American Bank for
Economic Integration not only with a viewto improving the effectiveness of
lending by major external agencies at the national level, but also to help
assure that Government programs are developed in a manner consistent with
Central American priorities.
18.        IFC has made only one investment in Costa Rica ($0.6 million in
1966 to Productos de Concreto, S.A.) which has been fully repaid. At
present, IFC is exploring the possibility of participating in the financing
of the proposed aluminum project.



-7-
PART LII - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
19,       Transport plays an important role in the economy of Costa
Rica, which depends heavily on exports of primary commodities and
imports of machinery and intermediate goods. Expanding regional
trade and the need to open up new lands for productive use have also
increased the pressure for a more satisfactory transportation network.
However, the country has topographical and climatic features which
make provision of the necessary facilities both difficult and costly.
In the past ten years the transport sector absorbed aDproximately -
25 percent of total public direct investment. Most of the transport
investment expenditure was for highways which is the dominant transport
mode in Costa Rica, and in 1973 accounted for about 86 percent of all
ton-km and 98 percent of passenger-km generated in the country.
Railways account for most of the remaining traffic; the significance
of air traffic, coastal shipping and pipelines is marginal.
The Highway Sector
20.       Costa Rica has a total highway network of about 23,000 km
of which 1,500 km are national highways, 900 km are regional (provin-
cial) highways and the balance are feeder roads. About 65 percent of
the national and regional highways and less than 1 percent of the
feeder roads are paved. About 75 percent of the feeder road network
consists of earth roads usable only during the dry season. With the
help of USAID, IDB, CABEI and the Bank, the Government has made a major
effort to improve the highway network. Between 1963 and 1973 the
length of the all-weather highway system almost doubled, and further
additions to the system are in progress or in preparation.
21.       Government efforts in highway construction followed largely
in response to the expansion of road transport which has been in-
creasing rapidly during the past decade. During this period the
total vehicle fleet (consisting of 60 percent passenger cars, 36 percent
trucks and 4 percent buses) has increased by 12 percent per year,
reaching 86,500 vehicles in 1973, or 1 vehicle per 20 inhabitants, which
is considered an adequate density to meet existing traffic demand.   The
most dynamic segment of the vehicle fleet was trucks, which grew at 14
percent p.a. between 1963 and 1973.
22.       Highway investment programs are the responsibility of
the Ministry of Public Works and Transport. The latest program,
covering the five-year period 1975-79, was prepared with the assist-
ance of consultants (a US and a Costa Rican firm) End lists about
575 km of roads to be constructed or improved. It is estimated
that this program, together with the feeder road program discussed
in paragraph 24 below, will require an investment expenditure of about
02,000 million (US$230 million). Because of the rapid growth of the
road system, total road user revenues are substantially less than



-8-
present or planned total expenditures on highways, but appreciably higher
than current highway m:intenance costs, including administration. It is
estimated that about 60 percent of the 1975-79 investment expenditures would
be financed by external borrowing.
23.       The appraisal mission, however, reviewed the 1975-79 program and
found that, except for the proposed project, the economic justification of
principal highways included therein had not yet been studied.   To remedy
the situation, the Ministry's newly created Transport Sector Planning Office
(TSPO) would obtain experts who would advise the Ministry on defining the
priorities within the transport sector, including assistance in determining
the economic justification of the proposed highway investment program.
(Sections 2.02 (a) and 3.09 of Draft loan Agreement.)
24.       With the financial assistance of USAID and IDB the Government
has carried out a substantial feeder road construction program over the
past decade. At present, through the Instituto de Fomento y Asesor{a
Municipal (IFAM), a decentralized agency of the Government, a new program
for feeder road construction is being prepared (with the assistance of
USAID and IDB). It is expected that about 500-600 km of new feeder roads
would be constructed annually beginning in 1976. About hOO km of feeder
roads have already been preselected for the first stage of implementation,
and several of these roads are located in the area of direct influence of
the project.  The Government has agreed to submit to the Bank for review
by January 1, 1977, a plan and timetable for improving and expanding the
feeder road system within the area of influence of the project. (Section
3.08 of Draft Loan Agreement.)
Urban Transport
25.       Increasing demand for passenger travel in the metropolitan area
of San Jose has become a cause of serious concern to the Government. The
area's main traffic arteries are congested, and maintenance of adequate
public transport services has been difficult. A UNDP-assisted urban trans-
port study (for whieh the Bank is the executing agency) has now been com-
pleted and has identified needs for immediate traffic and transit improve-
ments as well as outlined projects which would deal with medium- and long-
term problems.
26.       The Government has requested CABEI to finance final engineering for
high priority civil works in the Metropolitan Area. It has also requested
Bank financing of additional technical assistance (see paragraph 39)
necessary for preparation of an urban transport project which would include
improvements in public transportation and traffic control measures and
regulations for the city of San Jose. The proposed urban project may also
include a 2.5 km arterial aecess road for the proposed San Jose-Siquirres
highway, as it is expected that the capacity of the existing access highway
will become insufficient by the late 19701s.



-9-
Railways
27.       Costa Rica has three separate railway systems. While the
railway on the South Pacific Coast (288 km) is operated by a private
banana company, the other two railways (INCOP, 162 km, on the Pacific,
and JAPDEVA, 581 Im, on the Atlantic coast) are operated by public
companies. Tn 1973, the railways carried only 11.5 percent of all ton-km
and less than 2 percent of all passenger-km generated in the country.
They primarily serve the traffic needs of the banana, and cacao plantations,
located in the Atlantic and the South Pacific regions. Although the volume
of traffic has increased in the last ten years (mostly because of rapid
expansion of banana exports, which now account for more than 50 percent
of all tonnage carried by rail), the m lative importance of railways in
the transport sector has steadily decreased, primarily because of the
absence of large volumes of bulk traffic (except bananas) suitable for
haulage by rail.
Ports
28.       The two main ports in Costa Rica are run by the same companies
that operate the railways--Limon by JAPDEVA and Puntarenas by INCOP.
(The physical condition of both ports has been in need of improvement for
a number of years. To correct this situation, a new port at the nearby
site of Caldera would replace the port of Puntarenas; financing from the
EXIMBANK of Japan is being arranged for this purpose.) Plans for improving
and expanding the port of Limon, the larger of the two ports, were developed
as early as 1964. In 1970, the Bank appraised a pro)ject based on a study
prepared by consultants which recommended construction of deepwater facili-
ties at a new site near Lim6n. However, negotiations were discontinued in
1971, primarily because of disagreements with the Government regarding the
creation of a National Port Authority, whose responsibility would have been
to coordinate future development of the port sub-sector in the country. In
view of this, JAPDEVA increased the port capacity at the existing site of
Lim6n; the Central Government provided most of the necessary financing.
Overall Transport Sector Planning and Coordination
29.       The National Planning Office (OFIPLAN), responsible for econo-
mic planning and coordination at the national level, has, until now,
lacked the organization and staffing necessary to provide adequate
guidance to sectoral planning offices, such as the Directorate General of
Planning (DGP) of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, or JAPDEVA
and INCOP, in charge of ports and railways. In add-ition, the public
companies in general, such as INCOP and JAPDEVA, have enjoyed a consider-
able degree of autonomy which made overall planning and coordination ex-
tremely difficult.  Both institutions made efforts in recent years to
develop independent rnlans for rehabilitation and modiernization of their
facilities.  The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that
INCOP and JAPDEVA were competing T;!ith each other, and each tried to increase
its share of the transport market at the exoense of the other.



- 1o -
30.       However,in 1974,the Government undertook a major effort to strengthen
OFIPLAN. Technical and financial assistance were made available and
legislation enacted expanding the role of OFIPLAN in the development
process. At the same time, measures were taken to limit the autonomy
of public companies, thus permitting the Government more effectively to
control and coordinate the operations and development of the entire
public sector and reducing the possibilities of misallocation of re-
sources.
31.       To deal with the transport sector in particular, in June 1975
the Government upgraded DGP into the Transport Sector Planning Office
(TSPO) which, while remaining part of the Ministry of Public Works and
Transport, will be responsible for overall sector planning and inter-
modal coordination and will be a link between the independent transport
subsectors and OFIPLAN. In future, in order to provide assurances that
investments in the transport sector will be supported by adequate economic
justification, all investment plans and feasibility studies in the sector
will be subject to TSPO approval. The technical assistance components of
the proposed loan are specifically designed to assist TSPO in defining and
implementing adequately justified investment priorities in the transport
sector.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Fourth Highway Project -
Costa Aica" (No.  i3la-CR, dated December 12, 1975) is being distri-
buted separately. The main features of the loan ani project are summarized
in Annex III. Following substantial completion of detailed engineering for
the proposed highways by the end of 1974, the project was appraised in
December 1974. Negotiations were held in Washington on December 3, 1975.
The Government of Costa Rica was represented by Ing. Mario Fernandez,
Vice Minister of Public Works and Transport.
Background
33.       The Bank's first operation in the transport sector (Loan 299-CR,
and Credit 10-CR, for IJS$ .5 million each) was indPrtakPn in 1961 to
assist in financing the first stage (630 km) of the NatLonal Highway
Program and the purchase of maintenance and construction equipment.
Progress on the project lagged, but a reduced program of 510 km of
roads was satisfactorily completed in 1968. The delays resulted largely
from a shortage of local funds and the inability of the local contracting
industry to handle the large number of small contracts involved,
international contractors having shown little interest.
34,      In 1970, a second Bank project (Loan 664-CR, US$15.7 million)
was undertaken comprising, essentially, construction of a new 57-km
two-lane highway between Siquirres (which is linked to San Jose by an
existing road) and Lim6n, Costa Rica's main Atlantic port. Most of the



highway was eompleted on schedule (by end 1974) and is already in use.
The few remaining elements were completed in December 1975. Originally,
this project also included a feasibility study for an improved highway
link between San Jos6 and Siquirres, but the study was subsequently
removed from the project and included in a Highway Studies Project ap-
proved in 1972 (Loan 872-CR).   This loan, for US$1.l. million, covered
(a) a feasibility study designed primarily to determine whether it was
more economical to irrmprove the existing roads between San Jos6 and Si-
quirres and San Jose and Puerto Viejo or to construct a completely new
road system from San Jose to Siquirres and Puerto Viejo and (b) detailed
engineering for the most economically feasible alternative. The feasibi-
lity study demonstrated the economic advantage of constructing new roads
and, together with the detailed engineering subsequently carried out, has
formed the basis of this proposed Fburth Highway Project.
Project Description a-id Financing
35.       The project consists of:
(a)   Construction, including consulting services for supervision
of civil works, of two new main highways, San Jose-Rio
Sucio-Siquirres (about 96 km) and Rio Sucio-Puerto Viejo
(about 29 km);
(b) Establishment of two permanent weighing stations and the
nurchase of portable scales, and of vehicles and
equiTment for construction supervision;
(c)   Technical assistance for:
(i) Transport planning; and
(li) Preparation of an urban transport project for
San Jose.
36.       Total project cosl;s, including contingencies, are estimated
at US$74-0 million equivalent, of which US$50.7 million (68 percent) are
in foreign exchange.   Physical and price contingencies are estimated at
the equivalentof US$23.0 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$39.0
million would cover about 77 percent of the project's estimated total
foreign exchange costs, or about 53 percent of total costs. The remaining
US$11.7 million in foreign. exchange and the US$23.3 million equivalent in
local funds would be provided by the Government.
37.       The proposed highway from San Jos6 to Siquirres would provide
the remaining part of the improved San Jose-Lim6n linik (see paragraph 34
above) by replacing the existing road, San Jose-Turrialba-Siquirres, with
a new route via Rio Sucio.   The present San Jose-Siquirres road now has
noor geometric standards with many unstable roadside cuts and generally
inadecuate drainage.   Large segments of the road have poor, and sometlmes
no, asphalt raving.   The road is also dangerous as a. result of poor design



- 12 -
ancf of frequent dense fog in several areas. Average speeds are low
and capacity is restricted; some sections are already presenting signs of
congestion. The proposed highway to Puerto Viejo would replace the
present 95-km, 2-lane road to San Jose, which is of extremely poor geo-
metric standards, with steep grades and poor alignment, with a more
direct route via Rio SulciO, wh-ile at the same time opening up a new area
of considerable agricultural po,ential.
38.       To ensure proper usage of the proposed highways, the project
includes:  (i) establishment of two permanent vehicle weighing stations,
one on the project roar] north of San Jos6 and the other on the Siquirres-
Lim6n highway; and (ii) procurement of five portable scales for use on
road sections where traffic volumes would not warrant permanent stations.
The vehicles and equipmient included in the project are required for
supervision of the civil, works.
39.       To assist institution-building in the sector, the loan would
finance the foreign exchange component of consulting services for technical
assistance in two areas:
(a)   Transport Planning.  As mentioned in paragraph 31 above,
consultants would assist the Ministry of Public Works and
Transport in the formulation of transport policy and an
investnrent plan for the sector. They would help (i) define
data required for transport planning and initiate a system
for collection of data on a routine basis; (ii) study the
collect:on and allocation of road user charges; (iii)
defiine nethodologies for transport cost studies and project
feasibiLity studies; and (iv) train counterpart personnel.
An amount of US$900,000 equivalent has been included in the
project for the necessary consulting services. Agreement has
been reached with the Government on the terms of reference for
the consultants and on the appointment to the TSPO of
adequate counterpart personnel.
(b)   Urban Transport Planning and Project Preparation.  During
the execution of the UNDP transport study of the Metropolitan
Area of San Jose (parag-raphs 25 and 26 above), it became
apparent that the Ministry of Public Works and Transport needs
additional technical assistance in order: (i) to help pre-
pare a program for bus operations to be implemented as part
of the urban transport project being proposed on the basis
of the reco mendations of the UNDP study; and, (ii) to assist
in the implementation of an over-all transport management
program.  An amount of US$300,000 equivalent has been included
in the nroject for the cost of the consultants to provide
such assistance.
Project Execution and Supervision of Works
ilO.      Execution of the project would be the responsibility of the
'linistry of Public Works and Transport and would extend over a period of



- 13 -
about four years. Supervision of the works would be carried out jointly
by the Ministry and local and foreign consultants.  The number and
qualifications of the Ministry's staff on the supervisory team, and the
terms of reference and conditions of employment of the consultants have
been reviewed with the Government.
Procurement
41.       Contracts for civil works would be procured by international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines0 The con-
struction work would be divided into six sections, and bidders would have
the opportunity to bid on one or several sections, according to their ca-
pacity. Several local contractors have the capacity to undertake the con-
struction of one of the sections, and, in joint venture, of several of
the smaller sections. (Cost estimates assume that the main civil works
contracts will be carried out by foreign firms with subcontracting of
portions of the works to local firms.) Vehicle weighing stations and
portable weighing scales, and vehicles and equipment for supervision,
in total estimated to cost US$0.3 million, would be procured locally, in
accordance with the Government's competitive bidding procedures and subs-
ject to Bank approval. This procedure is justified by the relatively
small amount to be procured and the advantage of ensuring standardizati on.
Disbursement
42.       Disbursement from the Lioan account would be made for:  (i) civil
works, on the basis of 100 percent of foreign exchang3 expenditures
or 57 percent of total expenditures; (ii) consulting services for super-
vision of road construction, on the basis of 100 percent of the foreign
exchange expenditures for these services; (iii) procurement and installa-
tion of weigh stations and scales and for procurement of vehicles and
equipment for supervision, on the basis of 100 percent of the foreign
exchange expenditures; and (iv) consulting services for technical assis-
tance for transport sector planning and for urban transport planning and
project preparation, on the basis of 100 percent of the foreign exchange
expenditures for these services.
Economic Justification
3.       The propose( 96-km San Jose-Rio Sucio-Siquirres highway, together
with the 29-km Pio Si:cio-Puerto Viejo connection would he a part of the
basIc trunk road sys-;em of Costa Rica, completing the first all-weather
road link from the capital to the Caribbean. Major benefits from this
pro ject would be ach-ieved primarily by:
(a)   reducing operating costs, generating time savings to
road users and providing all-weather service to areas
previously completely isolated (or isolated during
the 6-month rainy period), thus helping 1-o bring these
areas into the mainstream of the country'3 economic life;
(b)   facilitating access to new agricultural and forested
areas, thus stimulatIng the fvll deveDpmen--t ofr tlheir
produrt-ve capacity.



44-      It is estimated that about 80 percent of the brnefits attri-
butable to the project would consist of road-user savin:s, while the
remaining 20 percent would include increased value of ag>ricultural,
livestock and forestry production from the area of influlence of the proposed
highways. It is estimated that in this area croplands uould increase
from about 26,000 ha at present to about 46,000 ha by the end of the
century; in the same period, pastures would increase from about 1l4,000
ha to about 220,000 ha. It is expected that the Government will use at
least a part of the land made accessible by the proposed1 project to
promote colonization schemes.
bL5.      The alignment of project roads was selected on the basis of a
comparative economic and technical feasibility analysis of improving the
existing roads from San Jose to Siquirres (through TurrLalba) and from
San Jose to uLerto Viejo (through Heredia).  It was established that the
proposed highway w.lll nrovide t-he least transport cost alternative between
San Jose, Siquirres and Piuerto Viejo.  The proposed hig>iway showed not
only a higher economic return (18 percent against 13 pe rcent to improve
the existing roads), but also presented a better techni(al solution while,
at the same time, Pr-viding road access to extensive ar* as of valuable
agricultural potential heretofore isolated.  Sensitivit: analyses have
been carried out on the main parameters affecting the e onomic evaluation
of the project, and show that the economic rate of retu-n wrould be accept-
able even under adverse assumntions, as a 25 percent increase in project
costs would still yield an economic rate of return of 15 percent.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Costa Rica
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Arti~cles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text
of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Besides the specific features men-
tioned elsewhere in this Report, the draft Loan Agreement conforms to
the normal pattern for loans for highway projects.
1-7.     I an satisf ed that the proposed loan would coriply with the
Articles of Agreemen F of the Bank.
PART VII - RECOIM4ENDATION
48.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approre the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
66L       Siquirres-Limon Highway Project:   US$15.7 Million Loan of April 2, 1970;
Effective Date:  June 17, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The project was completed in Decemnber 1975---ten a nt,hs behind the
oraginal schedule.   The final eosts are expented to exceed ..ie
original esbimate by about 20 per-rent.  7he Governient has finansed
the additional costs out of ,ts owM resoulrces.
3500      Fourth Power Project:   US$6.5 Million loan of February 2)4, 1972:
Effective Date: June 2, 1972; Closing Date: Jane 30, 1976.
The proiect has been progressing satisfactorily.   Installation of some
transmission lines and substations--the only uncompleted project
elements--will be delayed by up to twelve months because of changes
in the borrower's ;:ogram.   The exDected cost of the project is sub-
stantially the same as the appraisal estimate.
801       Third Telecommunications Project:   US$17.5 l'iSllion Loan of February 2L, 1972:
Effective Date: June 2, 1972; Closing Date: Jane 30, 1977.
After some delays attributable to revisions of the project scope and
late deliveries, the project is now progressing satisfactorily and is
expected to be completed by December 1976, which is the original
completion date. All procurement arrangements have been finalized.
An estinated 18 percent overrun in the project total costs is expected,
mainly due to increases in local cost elements.
827       Second Agricultural Credit Project:   US$9.0 Million Loan of June 5, 1972:
Effective Date: January 25, 1973; Closinig Date: December 31, 1976.
About 80 percent of the loan amount has been committed, which is
in accordance with the original schedule; however, disbursements
are lagging. In view of corrective measures beiing taken by the
Central Bank, full disbursement is expected by the original closing
date, December 31, 1976. As in the case of the first loan for
agricultural credit, lending for livestock has surpassed appraisal
estimates. So far about 67 percent of all funcls committed have
gone to livestock and about 5 percent to crops,, compared with an
expected distribution of 43.7 and J1.9 respect'Lvely. Loans for
agro-industry have amounted to almost 30 percent of funds committed,
nompared with 6.2 percent estimated at appraisal.

672       Highway Studies Project: US$1.4 Millicn Loan of December 28. 1972:
Effective Date: Jure 29, 1973; ClDsing Date: December 31, 1975.
The project, which consists of detailed engineering studies for the
proposed San Jose-Siquirres and Rio Sucio-Puero Viejo Highways, was
substantially completed by the end of 1974, but. finalization of the
studies was not completed until September 1975, about nine months
behind schedule.  The delay occurred mainly because .ore time was
needed to explore alternative designs for a numiber of bridges (using
post-tensioned concrete instead ol structural steel), with a view to
r-educig the estf,imated construction costs. XhE orggina1½i6osng
date (December 31, 1ITh) has been postponed by one ye-ar to permit final
payments to consultants.  The total cost of the project, as implemented,
is approximately the same as the arpraisal estimate.
915       Education Project: US$6.2 Million Loan of June 25, 1973:
Effective Date:_ December 27, 1973; Closing Date: December 31-,-1275.
The nroject is over a year behind schedule--partly because of the
delay in Congressional ratification of the loan Agreement and partly
because of difficul ties encountered in the organization and function-
ing of the Project Unit. Some improvement has been noted in the oper-
at.ion of the Project unifL', al,though close supervision is still required,
and a revised and accelerated implementation schedule lhas been devel-
oned.  There may be, however, some reduct-ions in project scope, result-
ing rirmarily from rapidly increasing construction costs.
100C      Fourth Telecornmunications Project:  US$23.5 Million Loan of June 1L  197L:
Effective Date: November 1 9, 197)4; Closing Date-  December 31, 1976
The project is progressing satisfactorily and about US$10.0 million has
already becn conmnitted. TNo cost overruns or .elays in implementation
are ernvisageci at this ti;;e.
1126       EIfth Pow-er Project:  US415tl.0 Tillion Loan of June 16 1975:
Closing Date: JTune.30, 1979.
Efectiveness of the loan has been delayed by legal and administrative
difficulties which arose in comnection with the revaluation of assets
of a su]bsidfiary of the borrower.  (Tne original terminal date for effec-
tiveness was October 15, 1275.)  These difficulties have now been re-
solved, although the terminal date for effectiveness has been postponed
until December 31, 1975, to permit completion of the documentation
necessary for the declaration of effectiveness.
