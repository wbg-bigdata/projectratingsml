A.   BACKGROUND
Employment Situation
1.    Mass unemployment as a result of the war is one of the major concerns of the authorities
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. An estimated 64 percent of the resident labor force is unemployed
and many of those with formal jobs receive only a fraction of their pre-war wages or are
underemployed because firms are working at reduced capacity. About 50 percent of the labor
force was employed in state-owned industrial enterprises before the war. The majority of these
have now collapsed and their future is uncertain. Many will need to go through a process of
restructuring and privatization before they can restart, and several large, non-viable industrial
plants that closed during the war may not reopen.
2.    Such high unemployment levels could threaten peace and economic recovery unless ways
are found to create jobs rapidly. Of particular concern are the job prospects for the 425,000
soldiers (245,000 in the Federation and 180,000 in the Republika Srpska) currently being
demobilized. The initial phase of demobilization involved those soldiers who were able to return
to their former homes and jobs and those whose education had been disrupted by the conflict.
The second phase of demobilization, involving about 140,000 soldiers, is currently ongoing and
poses more problems as many of these soldiers are unlikely to be able to return to their former
homes and jobs. New job opportunities are required for these soldiers and also for the 1.5
million people internally displaced during the war. Lack of employment opportunities also
represent a major constraint to the return of refugees. UNHCR currently estimates that about
145,000 refugees could return this year if adequate shelter and infrastructure, as well as job
opportunities are available.
3.    Reconstruction expenditures, estimated at over $5 billion in the period 1996-1999, will
generate considerable short and medium term employment. Both specialized and unskilled
manpower will be needed on a large scale for the reconstruction of housing, water and power
networks, schools, health facilities, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Overall job growth in
1996 (May-December) is expected to be about 20%. Though high, this is still far below what
will be required to absorb the large numbers of unemployed.
4.   In recognition of the need to urgently and pro-actively create job opportunities, the
Government, with the support of the World Bank, has designed an Employment Generation
Program. This has job creation as its primary objective and forms an essential part of the Priority
Reconstruction Program. The program has four main elements:
(i) support for labor-intensive public works to provide temporary employment for the
unemployed, including demobilized soldiers, displaced persons and returing refugees.
(ii) provision of employment counseling for demobilized soldiers and the unemployed on
available employment, training and business opportunities.
(iii) support for education and job training for demobilized soldiers and the unemployed.



Technical Annex
2 of 17
(iv) support for microenterprise development, in the form of credit and business services for
the unemployed, including displaced persons, refugees, war widows and demobilized soldiers.
5.    This Public Works and Employment Project supports the first element of this strategy by
financing labor-intensive public works at the municipality level. The employment counseling
and education and job training aspects are being supported through the Demobilization and
Reintegration Project. Microenterprise support is being provided for by the Local Initiatives
Project, the pilot phase of which is currently ongoing in Tuzla.
Damage to Municipal Infrastructure
6.    The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina has shattered the country's infrastructure. About 60
percent of the housing stock has been damaged. Transport networks have been devastated -
about 35 percent of the roads and 40 percent of the bridges have been damaged or destroyed,
either due to direct damage, or to lack of maintenance. Energy production has dropped by about
90 percent due to the destruction of power transmission lines and power stations. Water
networks have also been badly damaged leaving many communities without a functioning water
or sewage system. About 50 percent of schools and health facilities are in need of repair or
reconstruction.
7.   In addition to direct war damage, there is the indirect damage created by four years of war
and neglect. Garbage and the war debris have accumulated, particularly in towns and cities along
the confrontation line. Drainage and irrigation canals are blocked and many secondary roads are
badly damaged having been used well beyond their intended capacity during the war.
Institutional Setting
8.    This Project would focus on local level projects, those at the municipality level. Under
the political system established by the Dayton Agreements and the 1994 Federation Constitution
there are four levels of government, of which the municipality level is the lowest. There are a
total of 106 municipalities in the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina, some of which are now
divided by the inter-entity boundary line between the Federation and the Republika Srpska.
Municipalities (opstinas) have self-rule on local matters, including local utilities, maintenance of
local infrastructure, local social welfare, municipal courts, and education.
9.    Services at the municipal level are provided by municipal service companies called
komunalno that function like municipally owned joint stock companies. These include utility
companies for water and power, as well as companies responsible for public transport, solid
waste disposal, public parks and cemeteries. The revenues of these enterprises are kept separate
from municipal revenues. These municipal service companies traditionally initiated proposals
for project investments and, if the projects were local and did not require federal funding, they
were also planned and implemented by the company.
10.   The cantons are the next level of Government in the Federation. The equivalent regional
governments in Republika Srpska are known as districts. In the Federation, these regional
governments are responsible for the police force, education and cultural policy, housing policy,



Technical Annex
Page 3 of 17
policies relating to public services, local land use, local energy production, local business and
charitable organizations, local radio and TV, cantonal tourism, and the financing of cantonal
activities. For those municipalities whose ethnic majority is different from that of the canton as a
whole, the canton must delegate the responsibility for certain functions, including education,
culture, tourism, local business and charitable organizations, radio and television. The cantons
have only been functioning since the signing of the Dayton Agreements and in many areas they
are still weak and their relationship with the municipalities is sometimes unclear and politically
difficult.
11.   At the next level, there are two constituent political entities -- the Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. The Federation and Republika Srpska governments
have responsibility for defense, internal affairs, justice, economic policy (including planning and
reconstruction), fiscal policy, energy policy, and the financing of their activities. The highest
level of government is the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBH). The State has exclusive
responsibility in the areas of foreign policy, foreign trade, customs policy, international law,
immigration, common telecommunications, air traffic control, civilian coordination of activities
of the armned forces in the whole territory of SBH, the finances of the SBH budget and a common
monetary policy.
B.    BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
World Bank Strategy and Programs in Bosnia and Herzegovina
12.   On April 1, 1996 Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) fulfilled the conditions of succession to
the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC.
Membership is retroactive to February 25, 1993.
13.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-
funded reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the Bank, IMF, EU and EBRD in late
1995 resulted in the proposed Priority Reconstruction Program which was first presented to a
donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels, a week after the signing of
the Paris/Dayton Peace Agreement. This meeting led to donor commitments of about US$600
million for immediate reconstruction activities. A second donors' conference, again co-chaired
by the Bank and the EU, was held in mid-April, 1996 and resulted in additional donor pledges on
the order of US$1.2 billion for financing priority reconstruction activities during 1996.
14.   The Bank has been following a two-track assistance strategy, which seeks to leverage its
limited resources with significant resource transfer from donors. First, before arrears resolution,
the Bank supported selected immediate assistance programs through a special Trust Fund for
Reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH) which is providing US$125 million on
concessional terms equivalent to those offered by IDA, as well as an additional US$25 million in
grant funds. Seven emergency operations, committing the entire US$150 million, have been
approved under the TFBH: an Emergency Recovery Project; a Water, Sanitation, and Solid
Waste Urgent Works Project; an Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project; an Emergency



Technical Annex
4 of 17
Transport Project; an Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project; an Emergency
Education Reconstruction Project and a War Victims Rehabilitation Project. Second, following
arrears resolution (which was made possible by the effectiveness of the Consolidation Loan
package on June 14, 1996), while the Bank will continue to focus on supporting the
implementation of the reconstruction program, its assistance program will be broadened to
include support for the initial phase of the government's macroeconomic and institutional
reforms. In the area of reconstruction, Bank assistance will focus on employment generation and
housing, both needed to facilitate the reintegration of demobilized soldiers and the return of
refugees, as well as on continued support for the rehabilitation of infrastructure and clearance of
landmines.
Pilot Projects
15.   During project preparation, the Bank has financed pilot public works sub-projects, using
resources from the Netherlands Trust Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The objective of such
pilot projects was to (i) assess the level of demand for labor-intensive public works, (ii) gather
information on the price of unskilled labor and other input prices; (iii) refine sub-project
eligibility criteria; and (iv) develop and test standard sub-project contract documents. To date,
four pilot projects have been financed with an average cost of about US$ 50,000:
* repair of 3kms of tramway to Ilidza. Financing provided for labor costs only (295
man-months); equipment financed by the European Commission. This project is
currently under implementation.
* clean-up of six city cemeteries in Sarajevo in preparation for the relocation of graves
to official cemeteries. Financing of labor (171 man-months) and equipment costs.
Implementation is nearing completion.
*  clean-up of war ruins in Goradze municipality. Financing of labor (170 man-
months). Currently under implementation.
* emergency road repairs and clean-up of war ruins in the municipality of Maglaj.
Financing of labor (80 man-months), materials and equipment. Currently under
implementation.
16.   Further sub-projects are under consideration and will be financed prior to project
effectiveness. Lessons learnt from these pilot projects include the finding that labor is available
at the estimated cost of labor (1 ODM/day net); the need to coordinate carefully with other donor-
financed projects and maximize the amount of project fumds spent on labor by encouraging other
donors to finance the equipment costs of the public works sub-projects. For the Ilidza tramway
repair pilot project, for example, the European Commission financed the tramlines and other
necessary equipment, while the Netherlands Trust Fund financed labor costs.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Experience.
17.   The Bank has considerable experience in financing small-scale public works projects,
most commonly through so-called social fund operations. These projects have proven successful



Technical Annex
Page 5 of 17
at building flexible and efficient institutional mechanisms for financing local level investments.
The design of the proposed Project incorporates the lessons from these operations, while taking
into account the country context and conditions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At an operational
level, lessons learnt include:
a) the importance of institutional autonomy andfreedom from political interference for the fund
to allow it to operate quickly and transparently;
b) the importance of demand driven operations, meaning that local entities decide on which
sub-projects they wish to apply for financing and prepare the project proposal;
c) the importance of simplified procurement and disbursement procedures for efficient and
rapid sub-project implementation;
d) the need for clear operational procedures to guide project targeting and sub-project
selection; and
e) the need for strong supervision andfinancial controls at both managerial and sub-project
levels.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
18.   After four years of war, Bosnia and Herzegovina is faced with critical problems of
unemployment. This project addresses this situation directly by rapidly increasing employment
opportunities -- an estimated 100,000 man-months of labor could be created under the project.
The Bank is well-placed to assist the Government set-up the project given its experience with
similar operations in over 20 other countries.
Relationship with other Bank-financed Projects
19.   This Project has been designed to complement other projects under the employment
generation program, particularly the Demobilization and Reintegration Project and the Local
Initiatives Project. The Demobilization and Reintegration Project aims to assist the economic
reintegration of displaced workers, particularly demobilized soldiers, into the civilian workforce
through provision of job placement counseling, training and education. This Project will provide
temporary job opportunities for these demobilized soldiers. The Local Initiatives Project will
provide financial and technical support to microentrepreneurs wishing to set up businesses,
complementing the more unskilled employment created under this Project.
20.   The Project will also complement other investments under the priority reconstruction
program by financing smaller-scale, more labor-intensive projects proposed by municipalities,
such as the clearing of war damage, cleaning of drainage canals, and minor road repair,
complementing some of the larger, more capital-intensive projects financed by the World Bank.
In the area of housing, the Project will only provide financing for minor public housing repairs in
small rural municipalities not covered by the Emergency Housing Repair Project. Water supply
sub-projects would consist primarily of the labor costs of digging trenches and laying pipes,
complementing the investments in equipment covered under the Water, Sanitation and Solid
Waste Urgent Works Project.

C.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Project Objectives
21.   The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a) create rapid employment for those unemployed as a result of the war;
(b) rehabilitate small scale public infrastructure and clean-up war damaged public
property and assets;
(c) reinforce the decision-making role and responsibilities of municipality governnents
in municipal infrastructure project design and management; and
(d) to deliver visible impact at the local level in the near term.
Project Components
22.   To support the above objectives, the Project would have two components. Under the first
component, financing would be provided for public works projects, as further described below.
The second component would provide institutional support for the establishment and operation
of an Employment and Training Foundation (ETF), in both the Federation and the Republika
Srpska, to administer project implementation.
Component 1: Public Works (US$41.4 million or 92% of total cost)
23.   The Project would finance labor-intensive, public works sub-projects at the municipality
level, up to a maximum cost of US$100,000 each. A total of about 440 sub-projects would be
financed over the two year project implementation period creating an estimated 100,000 man-
months of work. Sub-projects would be proposed by municipalities and would be simple in
conception and scope, requiring no longer than six months to complete. Sub-projects would be
screened according to three eligibility criteria: (i) degree of labor intensity; (ii) economic impact;
and (iii) social or environmental impact. During appraisal, it was agreed that given the
employment creation objective of the project, sub-projects should have, on average, a labor
content of 60%. Further sub-project eligibility principles are outlined in Appendix 1.
24.   According to the above criteria, first priority works would include clearing of war
damage, cleaning and rehabilitation of surface drains, ditches and river banks, rural road repair,
park and cemetery rehabilitation and reforestation projects. Second priority works include
rehabilitation of public housing, roads, repair of urban sewage and city street drains,
rehabilitation of social service buildings, such as schools and clinics, and repair of water supply
networks. A complete list of eligible sub-projects and their ranking is provided in Appendix 1.
25.   To ensure a needs-based distribution of Project funds, cantonal allocations would be
calculated based on four criteria agreed during appraisal: (i) cantonal population, (ii) number of
refugees, (iii) amount of war damage (based on no. of damaged houses), and (iv) number of
unemployed (provided reliable data is available). The determination of these allocations,
satisfactory to IDA, is a condition of effectiveness. These allocations would represent a ceiling
amount to be disbursed for sub-projects in any one canton. The initial agreed allocations may be



Technical Annex
Page 7ofl7
adjusted during project implementation, with the approval of IDA, to reflect implementation
performance.
Component 2: Institutional Support (US$3.6 million or 8% of total cost)
26.   This component would provide financing for the establishment and institutional capacity
building of a Public Works Department within the ETFs currently being set-up in both the
Federation and the Republika Srpska. These Foundations would also act as the umbrella
institutions for the Demobilization and Reintegration Project. Specifically, financing would be
provided for:
(a) staff salaries, vehicles, office equipment and operating expenses for the Public Works
Department of the ETFs (US$2.48 million). The Federation Public Works Department
would have a total of 26 staff and the RS Department 16 staff at the height of operations.
(b) technical assistance (US$0.83 million). Technical assistance (34 man-months of
foreign and 24 man-months of local) would be provided to help set-up the ETFs and
refine their operational procedures, including assistance to set-up financial controls,
define sub-project eligibility criteria, establish a management information system (MIS),
and set-up a unit cost database.
(c) training (US$0.13 million). Training would be provided for local staff, for example
in computer skills and database management.
27.  In order to maintain high levels of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the Foundations will
operate on an administrative overhead of 8% or less of the total Project cost.
Project Cost and Financing Plan
28.   Project Costs. The total estimated cost of the Project is US$45 million equivalent, net of
taxes and duties; US$30 million for the Federation and US$15 million for the Republika Srpska.
The foreign exchange costs amnount to US$9.73 million or about 22 percent of the total project
cost. A summary of Project costs by component is shown in Table I below with detailed cost
tables for the Federation and the Republika Srpska provided in Appendix 2.

29.    Financing Plan. Of the total Project cost of US$45 million, IDA would finance US$ 10
million (22 percent of total costs). Cofinancing for the remaining US$35 million is currently
being sought. To date, there is a firm commitment of US$4 million from the Norwegian
Government and a tentative commitment of US$2-3 million from the Italian Government. The
Project is designed in such a way that it can become fully operational with only IDA financing.
The financing plan is shown in Table 2 below.

Economic Justification
30.    The primary objective of this Project is the creation of short-term employment. Overall,
the project would create an estimated 100,000 man-months of work. The main direct economic
benefit will be the increase in household income for those employed under the Project. This
increase in purchasing power will, in turn, provide a boost to the local economy.
31.    Given the job creation objective of the Project, highest priority will be given to those sub-
projects with the highest employment generation potential (see Appendix 1). These sub-projects,
which include municipal-level clean-up and rehabilitation of parks, riverbanks, and cemeteries



Technical Annex
Page 9of17
will have social benefits (return to "normalcy", removal of evidence of war, environmental
quality), but cannot be expected to have a high economic returns as other investments. The less
employment intensive, but more economically productive, sub-projects are listed on the menu as
priority 2. These priority 2 activities, such as repair of utilities, streets, housing and other more
economic infrastructure, will have more measurable and significant economic returns. Road
repairs, for example, will increase the efficiency of travel time; irrigation rehabilitation will
increase crop yields; and repairs to surface sewage and water supply systems will reduce water
loss. Given the demand driven nature of the project, however, it is not possible at this stage to
estimate the breakdown of the portfolio of sub-projects and an overall economic rate of return for
the Project.
Environmental Impact
32.   The project will have limited environmental impact given the nature and size of the sub-
projects and has been assigned a "B" environmental classification. Many of the eligible sub-
projects will, in fact, lead to environmental and public health benefits, for example, cleaning-up
of garbage and war debris, cleaning and rehabilitation of drainage canals and riverbanks, and
repair of urban sewage systems and drains.
D.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project Organization and Management
33.   Institutional Structure. The ETFs in the Federation and the Republika Srpska would
have overall responsibility for project implementation in their respective territories. Project
funds will be lent to the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina on IDA terms. These funds will be on-
lent to the Federation and Republika Srpska, which shall make the proceeds of the credit
available to their respective ETFs on a non-reimbursable, grant basis under Subsidiary Financing
and Project Implementation Agreements acceptable to IDA.
34.   The ETFs would be established as autonomous, non-profit agencies under a Charter,
satisfactory to IDA. This Charter has been approved by the Governments of the Federation and
Republika Srpska (see Appendix 4). The organizational structure of the ETFs is depicted below:

35.   The ETFs have Boards of Trustees composed of representatives from relevant ministries
and organizations, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Physical Planning and
Envirounment, Ministry of Social Affairs and Refugees, the Ministry of Defense, and the
Employment Institutes and the Chamber of Commerce. The Board of Trustees of the Federation
ETF (FETF) has already been appointed. Appointment of the Board of Trustees of the Republika
Srpska ETF (RETF) is a condition of disbursement of the Republika Srpska component. The
Boards will be chaired by their respecti-ve Ministries of Finance. The Boards, which will meet
every three months, will be responsible for approving the regulations, policies, procedures and
annual budget of the ETF.
36.   Each ETF will have a Public Works Department set up to manage the day-to-day
implementation of the Project. This Department will be headed by an Executive Director,
appointed by the Board of Trustees.  During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
Executive Director and other senior management positions would be staffed satisfactorily to
IDA.  The Executive Director of the FETF has already been appointed.  An Executive
Committee, chaired by the Executive Director of the Foundation, and comprising the Financial
Director and two members of the Board appointed by the Chairperson on a rotating basis, shall
have the responsibility for approving proposals for sub-project financing up to amounts specified
in the Departments' Operational Manual.
37.   Sub-project Cycle. The project cycle of the Public Works Department will be divided
into three main stages: promotion and screening, appraisal, and implementation (see Appendix
In the Federation, there would be two representatives from each oinistry or organization, however, each agency
would have only one vote.



Technical Annex

5). During the promotional phase, which has already commenced as part of project preparation
and start-up, municipalities will be informed of the existence of the ETFs and the guidelines and
eligibility criteria for sub-project applications. Municipalities would then submit proposals to
the ETF for project financing. It is they who would identify and design the projects at their own
cost. Other entities, such as local community groups and NGOs, could put forward proposals for
financing by the ETF, however, such sub-projects would have to be channeled through the
municipal governments. Sub-project applications would be screened by the ETF according to the
eligibility criteria (see Appendix 1).
38.   If deemed eligible, the ETF technical staff will appraise the sub-projects in the field and
check the sub-project design and cost estimates. The appraisal of the sub-project costs will be
done using a unit cost data base maintained by the ETF. This database will be a tool to monitor
market prices throughout the country and would provide reference prices for labor and other
inputs against which proposed cost estimates would be evaluated.
39.   Once appraised, the sub-project dossiers would be forwarded to the Executive Committee
for approval. Taking into account the size (maximum sub-project cost of US$100,000) and large
number of sub-projects (estimated at 440 in total), IDA would require prior approval of only the
first 40 sub-project contracts ( 25 in the Federation and 15 in Republika Srpska) or until
contracting is done satisfactorily to IDA. After this, ex-post review of a random selection of
sub-projects would be carried out on a regular basis. These approval procedures may be changed
if the maximum project limit is increased over US$100,000.
40.   Upon approval, the municipality would select the contractor to carry out the works, in
accordance with Bank procurement procedures as directed by the ETF and using a standard sub-
project contract, acceptable to IDA. The contractor might be a municipal utility company,
private contractor or NGO depending on the nature of the works. The municipality would
supervise the works on a regular basis. The ETF technical staff would also carry out site
supervision visits at least once a month to check the progress of the works and authorize
requested disbursements. Disbursements would be made directly to the contractor by the ETF in
tranches based on work activities completed and confirmed during the site supervision visits.
Payroll records would also be provided by the contractor to enable the ETF to monitor
employment creation.
Procurement
41.   The proposed procurement arrangements for the Project are summarized in Table 3
below.

Figures in parentheses are the estimated amounts to be financed by IDA.
2/ The "other" category includes consulting services to be procured following Bank guidelines for the Use of
Consultants, and salaries, fees and other operating costs (travel and utilities), for which procurement procedures
would not be applicable.
42.    The Public Works Departments of the ETFs would have overall responsibility for
procurement activities. ETF staff will be trained in Bank procurement procedures during the
procurement seminars organized by the Resident Mission (the Executive Director of the
Federation ETF has already participated in a procurement seminar held in June 1996).
43.    Civil Works. The civil works contracts under the Project consist of public works sub-
projects identified and proposed by the municipalities up to a maximum sub-project cost of
US$100,000. These contracts, which would consist of labor and materials, would be dispersed
throughout the country. The small size of the contracts and their dispersed nature make
international competitive bidding inappropriate. Therefore, procurement of civil works would be
carried out as described  below.   Municipalities would be responsible for carrying  out
procurement, in accordance with the following procedures provided to the municipality by the
ETF.
44.    Procurement of Small Works (simplified national competitive bidding) will be used for
the public works contracts, except as described in paras. 45 and 46 below. Works shall be
procured under contracts awarded under lumpsum, fixed price contracts on the basis of
quotations obtained from at least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written
invitation. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for
the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the conitr-act
successfully. Approximately US$17.8 milliorn of contracts (US$2.7 million of IDA fu1nds) are
expected to be awarded following these procedures.



Technical Annex
Page 13of17
45.   Direct contracting will be used for contracts under US$50,000 up to a total value of
US$2.26 million (US$1.76 million for the Federation component and US$0.50 million for
Republika Srpska component) when justified by the unique character of the works or when only
one private contractor is available, or the municipality lacks the capacity to obtain three
quotations. The unit cost database managed by the ETF will set an acceptable price for the
contract, and the ETF will supervise the sub-projects to assure the work is of acceptable quality.
46.   Force account will be used for contracts up to a total value of US$1.4 million of IDA
funds (US$1.12 million for the Federation and US$0.32 million for Republika Srpska), provided
that the contractor agency can satisfy four requirements: (i) the works are uniquely suited to the
skills and capacities of the agency; (ii) the agency can demonstrate that it has the ability to
account for the funds disbursed to it; (iii) the agency will execute the contract for a fixed price
based on completed works; and (iv) the agency agrees to full supervision by the ETF of
completed works before the ETF authorizes disbursement. The ETFs' unit cost database will
establish reference prices for such contracts.
47.   Goods and Equipment. Goods and equipment to be procured under the Project's
institutional support component include vehicles, computers and office equipment totaling an
estimated US$0.45 million. National shopping will be used for contracts for goods available in
Bosnia and Herzegovina up to an estimated cost of US$200,000 per contract with at least three
quotations, up to an aggregate amount of US$480,000 of IDA funds. Packages of goods and
equipment above US$200,000 where international shopping would be applicable are not
anticipated.
48.   Consulting Services and Training. About US$1.01 million would be allocated to
consultant services and training under the Project. Consultants for technical assistance financed
under the project would be selected in accordance with the "World Bank Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants" (1981). Technical assistance would consist of specialized management, financial
and technical support, involving consulting firms and individual experts, both local and foreign.
About US$0.5 million would be used for contracts with consulting firms. Any consultancy
contract for over US$100,000 would be based on a shortlist of qualified firms.
49.   Recurrent Costs. Office supplies and materials will be procured through local shopping.
Other administrative costs, including salaries, utilities, and travel costs, will be included in the
ETFs annual budgets subject to IDA's approval.
50.   Bank Review. IDA would require prior approval of the first 40 sub-project contracts (25
in the Federation and 15 in Republika Srpska) or until contracting is done satisfactorily to IDA.
After this, ex-post review of a random selection of projects would be carried out on a regular
basis. These approval procedures would be reviewed if the maximum sub-project limit is
increased over US$100,000. Prior Bank review would also be required for: (i) equipment
contracts over US$50,000, (ii) contracts for the employment of consultant firms above
US$100,000; and (iii) contracts for individual consultants above US$50,000. For all consultant
services and training contracts, IDA would review the terms of reference. Procurement will also

be subject to review by an independent procurement monitoring and auditing unit currently being
set-up in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Disbursements
51.    The proposed IDA credit of US$10 million would be disbursed over a maximum  period
of two years. Estimated IDA disbursements are shown in Table 4.

52.    IDA disbursement categories are shown in Table 5 below. The closing date of the Project
is February 15, 1999. Out of the proposed credit, up to a maximum amount of US$1.0 million
(10% of the credit) would be available for retroactive financing to reimburse eligible
expenditures made after May 15, 1996 in respect of Categories A (the Federation component).

53.   Special Account. The State Ministry of Finance will establish Special Accounts in
commercial banks, acceptable to IDA, for both the Federation and the Republika Srpska, with an
authorized allocation of US$1.5 million for the Federation and US$1 million for Republika
Srpska, representing about 4 months of project expenditures. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the State Ministry of Finance would authorize individuals eligible to sign withdrawal
applications to disburse funds from the Special Accounts to sub-projects. For the Federation
Special Account, these would include the Executive Director of the Public Works Department of
the FETF. To expedite local payments, a corespondent account would also be established in a
local bank. Replenishment applications would be prepared by the FETF with reconciled bank
statements and other appropriate documentation.
54.   Documentation of Expenditure. Disbursements would be based on full documentation
of expenditures for equipment contracts over US$50,000 and for the first 40 sub-projects (25 in
the Federation; 15 in the Republika Srpska) which are subject to prior approval. Disbursements
for all other expenditures, including sub-project grants (civil works) below US$100,000,
consultinig services below US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individual consultants
respectively, and recurrent costs would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures
(SOEs) certified by the Executive Director of the Public Works Department. The required
supportinig documents would be retained by the ETF for at least one year after the receipt by the
Banlk of the audit report for the year in which the disbursement was made. This documentation
would be made available for review by auditors and by visiting IDA staff upon request.
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting
55.   The ETFs would be responsible for overall financial management of the project and
would establish accounting systems acceptable to IDA, with technical assistance, as required.
The ETFs would be subject to annual external audits by independent auditors, satisfactory to
IDA. The external auditors will be responsible for auditing all project accounts, the Special
Account and all disbursement requests made against SOEs. During negotiations, it was agreed
that a project audit will be carried out for each fiscal year by, independent auditors acceptable to
IDA, to be employed by October 31, 1996. Each ETF shall send certified copies of the external
audit report to IDA, including balance sheets, income statements, and the auditor's opinion on
whether the ETF is achieving its objectives in a cost-effective way and whether internal controls
are adequate to minimize the misuse of funds.
Supervision, Reporting and Monitoring
56.   Bank Supervision. Due to the demand-driven nature of the project, and the large
number of sub-projects to be reviewed, intensive supervision is required by IDA. This is in
keeping with the experience of other similar operations. Supervision will be carried out regularly
by the Task Manager who is based in the Resident Mission. Additional Bank staff and
consultants will be brought in to supervise the project on a regular basis, as required.
57.   Reporting.  Each quarter the Foundation would submit progress reports to IDA,
according to an agreed format, summarizing the sub-projects under different stages of review,



Technical Annex
16 of 17
procurement or implementation. A final report and evaluation of the outcome of the proposed
project would be prepared by each ETF no later than six months after the closing date.
58.   Monitoring.  Performance monitoring indicators were agreed during appraisal (see
Appendix 6).  These indicators reflect the objectives of employment creation, speed and
efficiency of the ETFs operations, and the policies of the ETFs on priority sub-projects and
targeting of resources. These indicators will be closely monitored during Bank supervision, with
a focus on achieving employment creation targets. prudent financial management, rigorous use of
the unit cost data base for sub-project appraisal. and the consistent application of the operational
procedures.
E.    BENEFITS AND RiSKS
59.   Benefits. The major benefits of the project are: (i) the creation of 100.000 man-months
of employment, as well as the multiplier effects within the economy; (ii) reconstruction and
rehabilitation of public infrastructure and services with the associated economic, social and
psychological benefits; and (iii) reinforcement and strengthening of local government capacity to
respond to local needs quickly.
60.   Risks. There is a general risk of a resumption of hostilities in the region. The project
should help offset this bv providing increased employmenit opportunities to the unemployed
people. Specific project risks include: (i) political interference in the Foundations' operations;
and (ii) misallocation of financial resources. Preparation of the project has incorporated the
lessons from similar operations so as to minimize these risks. In particular, the risks of political
interference and financial misallocation will be mitigated by equipping the ETFs with the
operational procedures that ensure autonomy and transparency of their operations, including
rigorous eligibility criteria, adherence to strict unit cost ceilings for sub-projects. and external
aLlditing, as well as intensive supervisioni.
F.    AGREEM ENTS REACHED
61.   During negotiations, the following agreements were reached on the implementation of the
Project:
(i) the State of Bosnia and Flerzegovina will on-lend the proceeds of the Credit to the
Federation and Republika Srpska on identical terms to the IDA Credit. These funds
will be made available to the FETF and RETF respectively on a non-reimbursable,
grant basis:
(ii) the Executive Director and other senior management positions would be staffed
satisfactorily to IDA,
(iii) the ETFs will each adopt an Operational Manual setting out the operational
procedures in respect of sub-project screening. appraisal, approval and supervision,

cost database for sub-project appraisal and costing;
(vii)selected performance indicators, agreed with IDA. will be used to monitor the ETF's
performance;
(viii) the ETFs will submit quarterly reports to IDA on project activities. in a format
acceptable to IDA; and
(ix) the ETFs will maintain accounting practices acceptable to IDA. A project audit for
fiscal year 1996 will be completed by April 30. 1997. by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA.
62.   The following are c*onditions ofeffectimeness were agreed during negotiations:
(i) establishment of the FETF, acceptable to IDA;
(ii) execution of the FETF Subsidiary On-lending and Project Implementation Agreement
between the State, the Federation and the FFTF; and
(iii) determination of the initial cantonal allocations of the proceeds of the Credit for the
Federation, satisfactory to IDA.
63.   It was further agreed that the following would be conditions of disbursement of the
Republika Srpska component, which are expected to fulfilled no later than December 31. 1996:
(a) the legal establishment of the RETF;
(b) the appointment of the RETF board of trustees; and

ELIGIBILITY PRINCIPLES AND SUBPROJECT MENU
Eligible Applicants
Only municipalities are eligible to apply to the Public Works Department of the
Employment and Training Foundations (ETFs) for financing of public works sub-
projects. Community councils, civil associations and non-governmental organizations
may also apply to the Public Works Department, however, such applications must be
approved by and channelled through the municipality.
Eligibility Guidelines
Applicants are responsible for carrying out the technical design of the sub-project at their
own cost, as a minimum contribution to the operation. Design and specifications must be
consistent with the existing norms and standards of the relevant ministries, if applicable.
To the extent possible, sub-projects should rely on locally produced materials.
An individual sub-project must cost less than or equal to US$100,000.
Works must be simple in scope and take six months or less to complete.
The cost of labor must represent at least 50 percent of the total cost of the sub-project
(labor intensity percentages by priority ranking will be defined in the Operational
Manual).
Sub-proects cost must be within the cost per beneficiary limits established in the
Operational Manual.
Eligible Sub-projects
*  Employment - priority will be given to projects with a high labor content.
*  Economic impact - priority will be given to infrastructure works having a direct
impact on the local economy.
*  Social & environmental impact - priority will be given to works having a positive
impact on the environment, public health or other social issues.
The initial eligible sub-project menu is presented below. Sub-projects are ranked from 0
(no impact) to 3 (high impact) for each criteria. An overall rank (from 0 to 3) is
calculated based on coefficients which favor employment (coefficient of 70 percent) over
the other criteria (coefficient of 15 percent each).

CHARTER
THE EMPLOYMENT and TRAINING FOUNDATION
[FEDERATION OF BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA]
[REPUBLIKA SRPSKA]
Considering the large levels of unemployment expected during demobilization and
reconstruction, and the difficulties of creating and finding new employment in the changing
market structure;
Considering the need to develop new skills among the labor force to improve their
chances for employment, and to create new job opportunities for the unemployed;
Considering the widespread devastation to municipal public assets and infrastructure, and
the need to provide for urgent clean up, rehabilitation and reconstruction of such infrastructure;
The Government of the [Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina or Republika Srpska]
decides to create the Employment and Training Foundation (ETF).
CHAPTER 1 - General
Article 1.    The Employment and Training Foundation (ETF), hereinafter referred to as "the
Foundation", is hereby established as a juridical person with administrative, technical and
financial autonomy.
The Foundation shall perform its activities pursuant to this charter and its implementing
Regulations.
The domicile of the Foundation will be the city of Sarajevo [or Pale] and it may open
offices in other cities within the country.
Article 2.    The Foundation's objective shall be enhancing employment opportunities for the
unemployed through the financing of various activities as defined in its Regulations and in

retraining, (c) public works, and (d) public service employment projects. The grants will be
subject to requirements on content, duration, technical standards and other aspects as set forth in
contracts with executing agencies and in Foundation Regulations and as may be agreed with
financing sources.
The Foundation may finance other activities than those described above by decision of its
Board of Trustees, provided that these projects will serve to achieve the objectives of the

Other Foundation activities include information, staff training, transfer of technology and
advisory work related to the main activities of the Foundation.

entities and submitted to the Foundation.
The Foundation will evaluate these project proposals and, if it endorses them, finance

agency, not the Foundation. The Foundation will, however, exercise technical and financial

Article 5.    The Foundation's financial revenues comprise:
- resources assigned by multilateral or bilateral aid programs;

- domestic and foreign donations; and
- other revenues and income that may arise.
Article 6.    The resources of the Foundation shall be deposited in independent commercial
bank accounts.
Article 7.    The [Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina or Republika Srpska] will provide to
the Foundation such budget resources as are required in accordance with international financial
