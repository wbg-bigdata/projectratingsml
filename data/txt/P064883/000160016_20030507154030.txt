Project 
Development 
Objective 
1. 
Project 
development 
objective: 
The 
Western 
Altiplano 
is 
characterized 
culturally 
by 
its 
majority 
indigenous (Mayan)  population, 
and 
geographically 
as 
encompassing 
the 
departments 
of 
Sololti, 
El 
QuichB, 
Totonicaptin, 
Quetzaltenango, 
San 
Marcos, and 
Huehuetenango. 
The 
region 
has 
a 
GDP 
per 
capita that 
is 
one 
fifth 
of 
the 
national 
average and 
(with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
department 
of 
Quetzaltenango) 
has 
the 
highest 
incidence 
of 
social 
exclusion 
nationwide. 
Almost 
60% 
of 
the 
economically 
active 
population 
is 
engaged 
in 
smallholder agriculture 
(minifundio) 
and 
reliant 
upon 
an 
increasingly 
degraded and 
declining 
natural 
resources 
base. 
Project 
Development 
Objective: 
The 
project 
aims 
to 
improve 
the 
management 
and conservation 
of 
natural 
resources and 
biodiversity 
and 
the 
incomes 
of 
the 
people 
who 
depend 
upon 
these 
resources, 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
of 
Guatemala. 
The 
project 
would 
help 
to 
alleviate 
rural 
poverty, 
reduce 
pressures 
upon 
and 
improve 
management 
of 
the 
natural 
resources 
base 
by: 
(a) 
increasing 
social capital around natural 
resources management, 
through 
support 
to 
communities,  organizations 
and 
local 
authorities 
(traditional 
and 
municipal) 
to jointly 
define and 
implement 
a 
local 
development 
vision 
which 
takes 
natural 
resources 
management  and 
sustainability  objectives 
into 
account; 
(b) 
increasing 
opportunities 
to 
sustainably 
improve 
productivity 
and 
diversify farming 
and 
other 
(off-farm) 
livelihood 
systems; (c) 
extending 
and 
strengthening 
ongoing 
efforts 
of  indigenous 
communities 
to 
establish  permanent 
conservation 
areas 
within 
broader 
zones 
of 
biodiversity 
of 
global 
importance 
and 
to 
maintain 
the 
habitats 
which 
sustain 
this 
diversity; 
and 
(d) 
establishing 
and 
piloting 
a 
framework 
for 
environmental 
services 
markets 
to 
sustain 
local 
incentives 
for 
conservation. 
The 
proposed 
project 
will 
form 
a 
part 
of 
the 
Government’s 
program 
of 
interventions 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Peace 
Accords 
for 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
As 
some 
95% 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the 
proposed 
project 
area are 
Mayan, 
the 
proposed 
project 
can 
also 
be 
considered 
an 
indigenous (Mayan) 
peoples 
development 
project. 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
municipal 
governments, 
communities 
and 
local 
groups 
to 
incorporate 
sustainable 
natural 
resources management 
into 
local 
development 
planning 
and 
investment, 
while 
building 
upon 
the 
successful 
Western 
Altiplano 
experiences 
that 
have been generated 
by 
NGO 
(e.g., 
HELVETAS, 
Movi 
Mundo),  bilateral 
(e.g., 
GTZ) 
and  government 
(e.g., 
INAB/BOSCOM) 
programs. 
The 
project 
will 
provide 
rural 
households, 
community 
groups 
and 
local 
authorities 
(traditional 
Mayan 
and 
local 
government) 
with 
instruments 
to 
improve 
rural 
incomes, create 
incentives 
for 
increasing environmental 
sustainability 
of 
production 
practices, and 
value and protect 
globally 
important 
biodiversity. 
Global 
Development  Objective: 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
improve 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
and  conservation 
of 
globally 
important 
biodiversity 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Mesoamerican

la. 
Global Program 
Objective 
addressed 
by 
the 
project: 
The 
proposed 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
GEF 
Operational 
Strategy 
for 
long-term protection 
of 
globally 
important 
ecosystems. 
This 
project 
supports 
Operational 
Programs 
No. 
2 (Coastal, 
Marine 
and Freshwater 
Ecosystems), 
No. 
3  (Forests  Ecosystems)  and 
No. 
4 
(Mountain 
Ecosystems). 
The 
emphasis 
on 
ecosystemic 
or 
ecoregional conservation 
strategies 
is 
an 
explicit 
design 
element 
of 
the 
proposed 
project. 
The 
GEF 
specifically 
endorses 
programs 
in 
the 
Mesoamerican 
Biological 
Corridor 
(MBC), 
where 
the 
project 
is 
located. Furthermore, 
the 
intent 
of 
the 
National 
Council 
for 
Protected 
Areas 
(CONAP) 
is 
to 
design 
protected 
area 
strategies 
which 
encompass 
connectivity 
and 
are  representative 
of 
ecosystems 
across 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
The 
emphasis 
on 
sustainable 
use 
is 
reflected 
in 
the 
close 
coupling 
of 
GEF 
and 
World 
Bank 
financing 
in 
support 
of 
improved productivity 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
natural 
resources. 
The 
project’s 
emphasis 
on 
the 
inclusiodparticipation 
of 
indigenous people 
and 
communities 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
GEF 
objectives 
of 
working 
with 
local, and 
particularly 
indigenous, 
communities. 
2. 
Main 
sector 
issues 
and 
Government 
strategy: 
Declining Natural 
Resource Base. 
More 
than 
one-half 
of 
the 
population 
of 
Guatemala 
lives 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
depends 
directly 
on 
natural 
resources 
for 
food, 
shelter, 
income, 
and 
spiritual 
sustenance. 
Agriculture 
and 
forestry 
account 
for 
60% 
of 
land 
use, 
with 
agriculture 
providing 
more 
than 
50% 
of 
employment, 
24% 
of 
GDP, 
and 
60% 
of 
export 
value 
nationwide. However, 
factor 
productivity 
in 
agriculture 
is 
very 
low, 
and 
productive 
investments 
in 
the sector 
amount 
to 
only 
10% 
of 
gross 
national 
investment, 
reflecting 
the 
high 
degree 
of 
neglect 
and 
the 
unsustainable 
extractive 
practices 
in 
the 
sector. 
While  providing 
important 
Page  8
Page 
4 
opportunities 
for 
sustainable  development, 
the  nation’s  renewable 
natural 
resources 
are 
subject 
to 
increasing 
pressure: 
some 
60% 
of 
the 
national 
territory 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
subject 
to 
accelerated 
soil 
erosion 
from 
human 
activity, 
with 
soils 
being 
unsustainably 
exploited 
under 
current 
production 
systems. 
Countrywide,  approximately 
90,000 
hectares 
annually 
are 
deforested. 
Protection 
of 
remaining 
forests 
within 
the Guatemalan 
Protected Areas 
System 
(SIGAP) 
is 
strongly 
threatened 
by 
extractive 
practices, 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
agricultural frontier  (particularly 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
and 
the 
Pet&) 
and 
weak 
management 
of 
the 
SIGAP. 
Rural 
Poverty. 
Despite relative 
macroeconomic stability, moderate growth, 
low 
external 
debt, 
and a 
fairly 
open 
economy, 
Guatemala 
scores 
relatively 
low 
on poverty 
and 
social 
indicators. 
In 
2000, 
over 
half 
of 
all 
Guatemalans 
- 
56% 
or 
about 
6.4 
million 
people 
- 
lived 
in 
poverty. 
About 
16% 
lived 
in 
extreme 
poverty. 
Rural 
residents 
account 
for 
over 
81% 
of 
the 
poor 
and 93% 
of 
the extreme 
poor. 
Three 
quarters 
of 
all 
rural 
residents 
fall 
below 
the 
full 
poverty 
line 
(US$547) 
and 
one 
quarter  under 
the 
extreme 
poverty 
line 
(US$242). 
Although 
the 
indigenous 
represent 
about 43% 
of 
the 
national 
population, 
they 
account 
for 
58% 
of 
the 
poor 
and 
72% 
of 
the 
extreme 
poor. 
Over 
three-quarters 
of 
the 
indigenous 
population 
live 
in 
poverty, 
as 
compared 
with 
41% 
of 
the 
non-indigenous. 
Poverty 
is 
also 
deeper 
and 
more 
severe 
among 
the 
indigenous. 
The 
ENCOVI 
2000 
also reveals 
that 
there 
are 
important 
differences 
in 
poverty 
rates 
between indigenous 
groups. 
The 
largest 
indigenous 
groups 
are 
the 
K’ichb, 
the 
Kaqchiqel, 
the 
Main, 
and 
the 
Q’eqchi. 
Among 
these, 
the 
Mam 
and 
Q’eqchi 
have 
the highest 
poverty 
rates. 
Loss 
of 
Social 
Cohesion. 
The 
protracted 
civil 
war  strongly  impacted 
indigenous 
communities 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
In 
the 
struggle 
between 
the 
army 
and 
the 
insurgency, 
the 
social 
fabric 
was 
torn 
apart, 
inter-ethnic 
trust 
was 
severely 
damaged, 
and 
community 
organizations 
and 
local 
power 
structures 
were 
destroyed. 
The 
signing 
of 
the 
Peace 
Accords 
between 1994 and 1996 ended 
most 
of 
the (overt) 
conflict 
and  established 
a 
framework 
for 
development. 
While 
more 
peaceful 
community 
relations 
and 
organizations 
are 
slowly 
re-emerging, there 
is 
still 
very 
little 
trust 
in 
institutions. 
Government 
Strategy 
Fostering Social Inclusion, 
Peace 
and 
Alleviating 
Poverty. 
The 
Peace 
Accords outline 
the Government’s 
inclusive 
development 
strategy 
for 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
and 
other 
affected regions 
of 
the 
country. The 
Accords 
state 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
construct 
a 
lasting 
peace 
in 
Guatemala, 
the 
poverty,  especially 
rural 
poverty, 
must 
be 
tackled. The Accords 
call for 
a 
reduction 
in 
social inequities, 
increased 
participation 
of 
indigenous  and other 
groups 
in 
economic  growth, 
sustainable management 
of 
natural 
resources, 
and 
regular Government dialogue 
with 
civil 
society 
on 
development 
of 
policy 
and 
legal 
instruments. 
Natural 
Resource 
Management 
and 
Rural 
Development. 
A 
strong and 
consistent 
set 
of 
natural 
resource 
policies 
exist, 
with 
the 
notable  exception 
of 
water 
law 
and 
policy. 
Current 
public  policies 
foster 
an 
atmosphere 
that 
permits 
decision-makers 
to 
make 
rational 
economic 
choices 
that 
can 
lead 
to 
sustainable 
economic 
growth 
and 
resource conservation. 
A 
market-oriented 
model 
with 
an open trade 
regime 
has 
been 
put 
into 
place 
over 
the 
past 
decade. 
Evidence 
suggests 
that 
policy 
makers 
now 
increasingly 
view 
companion environmental 
and 
natural 
resource 
policies 
as 
a necessity 
for 
a 
modern 
Guatemala 
and 
less 
as 
a 
constraint 
to 
economic 
growth. 
The 
current  government 
has 
further  contributed 
to 
this 
framework 
through 
the 
National 
Strategic Environmental Agenda 
2000 
- 
2004 
which 
proposes a 
framework 
for 
the 
integration 
of 
environmental 
policy 
into 
agriculture, 
industry, 
commerce, 
tourism, 
oil 
and 
natural 
gas, 
as 
well 
as 
providing 
direction 
on 
biodiversity,  climate 
change, 
desertification 
and 
drought. 
Created 
by 
legislative 
decree 
in 
2000, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
(MARN) 
is 
charged 
with 
implementing 
this 
policy. 
The 
challenge 
for 
MARN 
is 
to 
lead 
a process 
which 
creates 
a 
public 
system 
of 
environmental 
management, 
which 
in 
the 
specific 
case 
of 
natural 
resources management, 
brings 
together

the 
roles 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture 
(MAGA), 
the 
National 
Protected Areas 
Commission 
(CONAP), 
the 
National 
Forestry 
Institute 
(INAB) 
and 
Municipal 
governments. 
Decentralization. 
A 
recent 
World 
Bank 
report 
concluded that 
a 
limiting 
factor 
of 
decentralization 
in 
Guatemala 
is 
the 
coordination 
between 
the 
central 
level 
and 
their 
departmental 
and/or 
regional 
units. 
Little 
has 
been done 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
public 
or 
private 
sector 
groups 
to 
assume 
their 
roles 
and 
the 
extension 
of 
rural 
development  support  services 
on 
the 
part 
of 
government 
institutions 
has 
not 
been 
sufficient 
. 
Central 
government  transfers 
to 
municipalities 
currently 
are 
used almost 
exclusively 
for 
financing 
public 
infrastructure and 
to 
servicing 
municipal 
debt. 
Many 
municipalities lack 
the 
incentives 
and have 
only 
limited 
capacity 
to 
approach 
local 
development 
in 
an 
integrated manner and 
to 
include 
management 
of 
local 
natural 
resources. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
municipal 
governments  do  have  the 
constitutional authority 
to 
manage 
natural 
resources and the 
necessary 
participatory 
mechanisms 
are 
supported 
through 
the 
Decentralization 
Law; 
these 
latter 
offer 
a 
long-term 
foundation 
for 
resource 
management. 
They 
have, 
however, demonstrated 
little 
technical 
competence 
to 
do 
so. 
Biodiversity and 
Protected Areas. 
The 
country’s 
policies 
for 
biodiversity 
conservation and 
protected 
areas 
are 
contained 
in: 
(a) 
the 
National 
Biodiversity 
Strategy 
(published 
in 
early 2000 
with 
assistance 
from 
GEF 
funding 
through 
LTNDP), 
(b) 
the 
National Policy for 
the 
Development 
of 
the Guatemalan Protected 
Areas 
System 
(SIGAP), 
(c) 
CONAP’s 
Strategic 
Plan 
1999 
- 
2010;  and 
(d) 
the 
National 
Strategic 
Environmental 
Agenda 
2000 
- 
2004. 
The  central 
priority 
of 
all 
these 
is 
the 
in 
situ 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity, 
mainly 
through 
strengthening 
of 
the 
SIGAP. 
3. 
Sector 
issues 
to 
be 
addressed 
by 
the project 
and 
strategic 
choices 
Thematic 
and  Geographical 
Focus. 
A 
cross-cutting 
approach 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
watershed 
management 
is 
proposed, 
focusing 
on 
local 
communities 
and 
municipalities 
and 
their 
management and 
conservation 
of 
the remaining 
forest 
areas 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano’s 
upper 
catchments. 
Given 
both 
Government  and 
Bank 
priorities 
to 
reduce 
poverty 
under 
the 
Peace 
Accords,  a 
program 
with 
a 
strong 
productive 
and 
local 
development focus 
is 
proposed. 
Fifty-four 
(54) 
municipalities 
were 
selected 
covering 
some 
60% 
(about 
14,000 
sq. 
km) 
of 
the 
land 
area 
of 
the Western 
Altiplano 
and 
containing 
about 
50% 
of 
the region’s 
population 
(1.65 
million 
people). 
Based 
on 
SEGEPLAN’s 
poverty 
data 
(SEGEPLAN, 
2002) 
data, 
developed 
with 
World 
Bank 
assistance, 
forty-seven 
(47) 
of 
these 
have 
an incidence 
of 
poverty 
above 
70%, 
with 
all 
but 
two 
of 
the 
remaining 
seven 
with 
over 
50% 
local 
population 
below 
the 
poor line. 
Targeting 
of 
Resources. 
Currently, 
only 
about 
7% 
of 
financing 
from 
the 
social 
funds 
and 
other 
formal 
sources 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
goes 
to 
productive 
activities,  and 
most 
of 
these 
are 
off-farm,  infrastructure 
investments. 
The 
project 
would 
not 
fund 
social infrastructure 
investments 
(e.g., 
roads, bridges, 
potable 
water, 
electricity, 
clinics, 
schools) 
as 
local 
demand 
is 
largely 
unmet 
for livelihood 
improvement, natural 
resources and 
environmental 
management 
needs. 
Under 
the 
project, 
increased emphasis 
will 
be placed 
on 
linking 
communities 
to 
private 
sector 
assistance 
and 
markets 
for 
productive 
(on- 
and 
off-farm) 
opportunities. 
Community 
subproject 
grants 
will 
be 
targeted 
to 
the 
rural 
poor 
who 
do 
not 
currently 
have 
access 
to 
either 
subsidized 
or 
market-rate 
credit, 
and 
who 
as 
individuals 
are 
too costly 
to 
be 
served 
by 
financial 
institutions 
due 
to 
high 
risk 
and 
high 
transaction 
costs. 
The 
grants 
will 
be 
seed 
money 
with 
which 
communities 
and 
local 
groups 
are 
expected 
to 
undertake a 
wide 
range 
of 
productive 
and 
natural 
resources  management 
activities 
and 
initiate  local 
savings 
and  credit 
schemes. 
Also, 
by 
supporting 
traditional 
natural 
resource management 
systems 
and 
practices 
of 
the 
Maya, 
the 
project 
would 
strengthen 
social capital 
in 
a manner  consistent 
with 
local 
cultural 
norms 
and 
long 
term 
sustainability through 
existing traditional 
rules 
and 
systems that, 
to 
date, 
have been 
greatly responsible 
for 
conserving what 
natural 
resources 
of 
value remain.

Conservation 
of 
Biodiversity. 
The 
project 
area 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
harbors 
biodiversity 
of 
global 
importance. 
Using 
the 
WWF/WB 
ecoregion classification, 
it 
includes 
two 
ecoregions 
(Central 
American 
Pine-Oak 
Forests 
and Central 
American 
Mountain 
Forests) and 
which 
are 
poorly 
protected 
at 
present 
in 
Guatemala. 
A 
detailed 
study 
undertaken 
by 
The 
Nature 
Conservancy 
(TNC) 
revealed 
two 
large 
biogeographic 
units 
in 
the 
project 
area 
(the 
Volcanic 
Belt 
and 
the 
Sierra 
de 
Cuchumutanes) 
which 
are 
of 
the 
highest 
global 
priority 
due 
to 
levels 
of 
endemism, 
high 
diversity, 
and 
lack 
of 
protection. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
GEF 
funding, 
the 
Government 
of 
Guatemala 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
effectively 
address 
the 
conservation 
needs 
of 
the 
area. 
As 
a 
result, 
this 
project 
includes 
a request 
for 
$8 
million 
of 
incremental 
GEF 
funding. 
The 
main 
conservation 
gains 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
will 
be 
achieved 
through 
in 
situ 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity 
under 
a strengthened 
SIGAP 
and 
by 
working 
with 
local 
communities 
and 
indigenous 
groups 
consolidating traditional 
resource management 
approaches 
favorable 
to 
biodiversity. 
Environmental 
Services 
Markets. 
Natural 
resources 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
provide 
critical 
environmental 
services 
including hydrologic 
stability, 
soil 
conservation, 
habitat 
for 
biodiversity, 
scenic  beauty,  and 
reduced 
vulnerability 
to 
natural 
disasters. 
Recognition 
of 
the 
value 
of 
these 
services and 
development 
of 
appropriate 
market-based 
approaches 
and 
instruments 
that 
contribute 
to 
their 
maintenance 
is 
a 
key 
element 
for 
ensuring 
long 
term 
environmental 
sustainability. 
At 
present,  there 
are 
no 
ready 
local 
or 
national 
markets 
for 
these services; 
international 
markets 
continue 
to 
develop, 
especially 
for 
carbon. 
In 
this 
same 
context, 
the 
expected 
GEF 
donation 
is 
effectively 
a 
payment 
by 
the international 
community 
to 
Guatemala 
for 
the 
effort 
to 
be 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
to 
conserve 
biodiversity 
of 
international 
importance. 
Over 
the 
medium 
to 
long 
term, 
the potential 
exists 
to 
create 
markets 
through 
strengthening 
the 
link 
between 
the 
resource  managers 
that 
provide 
environmental 
services 
and 
the 
consumers 
of 
those 
environmental 
services. 
Under 
such arrangements 
direct 
payments 
or 
other 
forms 
of 
compensation 
(e.g., 
access 
to 
additional 
development 
assistance 
or 
opportunities, 
in-kind 
assistance 
from 
downstream 
beneficiaries) 
may 
be 
made 
in 
exchange 
for 
ensuring 
continued 
provision 
of 
the 
services. 
Experience 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
operational 
and 
policy 
mechanisms 
(more mature 
in 
the 
OECD 
context, 
incipient 
in 
much 
of 
the 
LAC 
region 
with 
exceptions such 
as 
Costa 
Rica) 
suggests 
that 
successful mechanisms are 
country 
and 
situation 
specific. 
Therefore, 
the 
project 
would 
work 
with 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
stakeholders and 
test 
and 
pilot 
those mechanisms 
identified 
as 
most 
appropriate 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
while 
simultaneously 
supporting 
the 
development 
of 
the 
required national 
policy 
framework 
and 
instruments. 
C. 
Project 
Description 
Summary 
1. 
Project 
components: 
The 
total 
project 
cost 
is 
US$55.6 
million, 
of 
which 
the 
World 
Bank 
will 
finance 
US$32.8 
million, 
Government 
of 
Guatemala 
$8.6 
million, 
the 
GEF 
US$8.0 
million, 
and 
project 
beneficiaries 
an estimated 
$6.2 
million 
(the 
latter 
primarily 
in-kind). 
Component 
1 
(Sustainable 
Livelihoods) 
is 
oriented 
toward 
improving 
the 
welfare 
of 
the 
rural 
poor 
through 
promotion 
of 
sustainable use 
and 
Conservation 
of 
natural 
resources. 
The 
component 
consists 
of 
two 
subcomponents: Subproject 
Grants 
and 
Local 
Institutional 
Strengthening. 
Subproject Grants: 
will 
provide 
grants 
to rural 
community 
associations 
in 
the 
54 targeted 
municipalities 
to 
finance 
an 
estimated  760  small-scale 
sustainable 
production, 
natural 
resources  management 
or 
conservation 
subprojects, 
identified 
by 
these 
groups 
as 
priority 
investments 
to 
improve community 
well- 
being. 
The 
grants 
will 
include 
financing 
of 
necessary 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training. 
A 
maximum 
of 
US$3,500 
of 
grant 
financing 
over 
three 
years 
will 
be 
available 
per 
participating 
household. 
The 
average 
size 
of 
a grant 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
be 
on 
the 
order 
of 
US$37,600, 
though 
larger 
grants 
would 
not 
be 
excluded 
where 
justified. 
The 
maximum individual 
grant 
would 
not 
exceed US$150,000. 
Subproject

funds 
will 
be 
disbursed 
directly 
to 
community 
associations 
with 
legal 
status 
and 
verified 
capacity 
to 
manage 
funds. 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
also 
provide 
those 
cross-cutting 
services 
required 
to 
ensure 
the 
functioning 
and 
impact 
of 
the 
local 
capacity 
building 
and subproject grants subcomponents. 
These 
include: 
(a) 
land 
and 
resource 
access 
conflict 
resolution 
assistance, 
consisting of 
rapid 
diagnostics 
in 
each 
municipality 
over 
communal 
forests 
and 
water 
sources 
and support 
to informal 
(local)  and 
formal (CONTIERRA) 
efforts 
to 
resolve 
such 
conflicts; 
(b) 
strategic 
regional 
services such 
as 
subject 
matter 
specialists 
to 
provide 
specific, 
short 
term 
assistance 
on 
project 
needs 
and, 
as 
jointly 
developed 
with 
the 
Instancias Locales, 
technical 
assistance 
to 
address 
needs 
that 
are 
broader 
than 
single 
subprojects  such 
as 
improving 
marketing 
and 
commercialization 
opportunities 
for 
‘green’ 
produce, 
applied 
research 
and 
market 
studies, 
and 
formation 
of 
strategic 
alliances 
between 
local 
and 
national 
farmers’  organizations,  exporters 
and 
international 
trade 
promotion 
groups; 
(c) 
training 
for 
municipal-level 
promoters, 
leaders, 
and  service 
providers 
in 
participatory 
planning 
and 
the 
project 
cycle, 
biodiversity 
and 
environmental 
management, 
organization 
development, 
marketing, 
non-farm 
income 
generation and 
informal 
savings 
and 
credit 
schemes; 
and 
(d) 
community-interchange 
program 
to  allow 
local 
leaders 
and 
participants 
in 
subprojects 
to  visit 
and 
exchange 
learning 
with 
other 
successhl 
communities. 
Local Institutional 
Strengthening: 
will 
provide 
grant resources 
to 
participating municipalities 
to 
finance 
specialized 
technical 
assistance, 
training 
and other  services 
as 
needed. 
The Project Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
will 
maintain 
a 
roster 
of 
pre-qualified 
service 
providers 
and 
facilitate 
the 
contracting 
of 
these 
services. 
Municipal 
capacity 
assessments 
will 
be 
conducted 
for 
each 
municipality 
to 
ensure 
their 
ability 
to 
administer 
funding. 
The 
grants 
will 
assist 
municipalities, 
their 
communities 
and 
local 
organizations, 
and 
participating 
GoG 
agencies 
in 
participatory 
planning, 
formulation 
and execution 
of 
local 
projects and 
programs 
for 
the 
use 
and 
management 
of 
natural 
resources. 
Technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to: 
(a) 
develop 
consensus 
on 
a 
municipal 
development 
agenda 
which 
incorporates 
natural 
resources management 
concerns; 
(b) 
strengthen 
municipal-level 
forums 
(Instancias Locales, 
see 
Annex 
2) 
in 
local 
development 
and 
natural 
resources 
planning; 
(c) 
strengthen 
an estimated 
850 
community 
associations 
in 
participatory 
planning 
and 
proposal 
development 
and 
provide 
assistance 
in 
obtaining legal 
status; 
and 
(d) 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
MAGA 
and 
MARN 
Departmental Coordinators and 
INAB 
Regional/Subregional 
staff 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
roles 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
program; 
this 
latter 
would 
include 
purchase 
of 
vehicles, 
computer  equipment 
and 
training 
in 
participatory 
planning, 
conflict 
management 
and 
environmental 
management.

Biodiversity 
Conservation 
Monitoring 
and Evaluation: 
to 
strengthen 
CONAP’s 
biodiversity 
monitoring 
and evaluation capacity 
by 
establishing 
a comprehensive 
biodiversity information 
system 
for 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
CONAP 
will 
implement 
these 
activities 
and: 
(i) 
upgrade 
its 
GIS 
with 
new 
equipment, 
computer 
programs, and 
data; 
(ii) 
update ecosystem maps 
for 
NAB; 
and 
(iii) 
establish 
a 
central 
database 
on 
protected 
areas 
within 
the 
SIGAP 
and 
other 
areas 
of 
natural 
habitat 
under 
other types 
of 
protective 
and 
use 
regimes 
(this 
system 
will 
have 
linkages 
to 
Western 
Altiplano 
regional 
offices 
and 
form 
part 
of 
a 
national 
system). 
Component 
3 
(Environmental 
Services 
Markets) 
The 
Component 
will 
(i) 
develop 
the 
framework 
for 
policies 
and markets 
for 
environmental 
services, 
through 
the 
elaboration 
of 
a 
National 
Strategy 
for 
Environmental 
Services; 
(ii) 
provide 
local 
and 
foreign 
technical 
assistance 
for 
research 
and special studies and 
training 
for 
local 
and 
national 
officials working 
in 
areas 
related 
to 
development 
of 
environmental 
services 
policy, 
legal 
framework 
and 
pilot 
programs; 
and 
(iii) 
design 
and 
implement 
pilot 
projects  aimed 
at 
developing 
capacity, 
methodologies 
and 
instruments 
for 
market-based 
incentives 
for 
provision 
of 
environmental 
services. 
The 
development 
of 
environmental 
services markets 
is 
seen 
as 
an essential element 
of 
a 
longer 
term 
strategy 
to 
achieve 
the 
sustainable 
use 
and conservation 
natural 
resources. 
A 
national-level 
group 
will 
be 
formed 
by 
MARN 
to 
coordinate 
efforts 
and 
share 
experiences 
on 
environmental 
services 
in 
Guatemala; 
the 
Grupo 
Interinstitucional 
de 
Acompaiiamiento 
(GIA), 
which 
was 
previously 
organized 
for 
this 
purpose 
but 
which 
has 
limited 
GoG 
participation, 
will 
be 
invited to 
participate. 
Component

Key 
policy and 
institutional 
reforms 
supported 
by the 
project: 
Policy 
analysis  studies 
undertaken 
for 
project 
preparation 
reveal 
an 
enabling 
and 
positive 
policy 
environment. 
Five 
principal 
policies 
- 
agrarian, 
environmental, 
biodiversity, protected 
areas 
policies 
and 
forest 
policy 
and 
law 
- 
underpin 
the 
GoG’s 
approach 
to 
natural 
resource management. 
Institutionally, 
the 
project 
implementing 
agencies 
promote 
the 
principles 
of 
decentralization 
and  deconcentration 
of 
responsibilities  and 
implementing 
resources. 
Principal 
weaknesses 
are 
lack 
of 
practical 
mechanisms 
and 
institutional 
arrangements 
for 
implementation 
of 
these 
policies through 
cooperation and 
coordination 
with 
private 
organizations 
(NGOs), 
local 
governments and 
communities. 
Therefore, 
the 
project 
will 
support 
key 
government, 
private 
and 
community 
sector 
actors 
to 
design 
and 
execute 
activities 
based 
on 
local 
priorities 
and approaches 
to 
conservation, sustainable 
use 
of 
natural 
resources 
for livelihood 
purposes and 
contribute 
to 
the 
GoG’s capacity 
to 
manage 
natural 
resources 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
the 
central-level institutions 
responsible 
for 
natural 
resource 
policy 
formulation 
and 
oversight 
(MAGA, 
MARN, 
NAB, 
and 
CONAP) 
to 
develop and 
institutionalize 
instruments 
for 
delivery 
of 
decentralized 
and 
privatized 
public 
services 
for 
natural 
resource  management. 
Training 
and 
“in- 
service” 
project 
experience 
will 
provide 
regional 
and departmental-level 
public 
sector 
staff 
with 
practical 
skills 
to 
work 
with 
communities 
and 
local 
governments 
in 
a 
decentralized 
and 
participatory 
manner. 
Government extension and 
rural 
development 
efforts 
have 
been 
mainly 
directed towards 
men. 
MAGA 
recognizes 
the 
importance 
of 
women 
in 
development, 
especially 
in 
the 
Altiplano, 
where 
men 
often 
leave 
the 
region for 
seasonal 
work 
elsewhere. 
Furthermore, 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
decades 
of 
violence, 
the 
percentage 
of 
women-headed households 
is 
the 
highest 
in 
the 
country. 
At 
MAGA’s 
request, 
the 
project 
supports 
MAGA’s 
development 
of 
a 
gender 
policy 
and 
the 
design 
of 
implementing 
mechanisms. 
Municipal 
governments 
and 
the 
local, 
traditional 
Mayan 
authorities 
(e.g., 
alcaldias 
auxiliaries) 
will 
be 
assisted 
to 
facilitate 
the 
participatory 
development 
of 
municipal-level 
“sustainable 
development 
agendas” 
for 
natural 
resource use 
and conservation 
by 
means 
of 
participatory 
priority-setting 
mechanisms. 
An 
Page  14
Page 
10 
analysis 
of 
the 
municipalities 
proposed 
for  inclusion 
in 
the 
project 
revealed 
a 
relative 
abundance 
of 
grassroots organizations,  committees, 
formal 
rural 
associations and cooperatives, 
and 
of 
private 
sector 
entities, 
particularly 
NGOs,  specializing 
and 
working 
in 
natural 
resource 
conservation 
and sustainable 
production 
technologies. 
These 
organizations 
provide 
a sound 
foundation 
on which 
to 
build 
effective 
civil 
society and 
private 
sector 
cooperation 
for 
planning 
and 
establishing 
local 
natural 
resources management 
and conservation 
priorities, 
as 
well 
as 
establish 
privatized 
service 
delivery 
mechanisms and 
implement 
technically 
sound 
investments 
in 
response 
to 
the 
local 
demands. 
3. 
Benefits 
and 
target 
population: 
The 
great 
majority 
(90-95%) 
of 
primary 
project 
beneficiaries 
will 
be 
members 
of 
one 
of 
13 
Mayan 
ethno- 
linguistic 
groups (K’ich6, 
Mam, 
Jalcalteco, 
Ixil, 
Tzutzujil,  K’akchik’el, 
Cliuj,  Kanj’obal, 
Sacapulteco, 
Uspanteco, Aguacateco, 
Sicapanense, 
and 
Tectiteco) 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
project 
area. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
ladino community 
members 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
equal 
access 
to 
project 
resources. 
The 
project, 
as 
a 
whole, can 
be considered an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan 
(see 
Annex 
11). 
This 
project 
has 
four 
types 
of 
primary 
beneficiaries: 
i) 
communities 
in 
54 
municipalities 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
where 
some 
760 
local 
subprojects 
would 
be 
financed; 
ii) 
municipal 
corporations 
that 
would 
receive capacity 
building 
assistance 
for 
planning 
and development; 
iii) 
communities 
that 
manage 
and 
benefit 
from 
communal 
forests 
and 
other 
conservation 
regimes; 
and 
iv) 
communities 
near 
and 
within 
the 
priority 
areas 
for 
biodiversity 
conservation 
which 
would 
receive 
assistance 
in 
natural 
resource 
management, conservation, and 
be 
eligible 
to 
access 
subproject grants. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
subprojects 
would 
directly 
benefit 
some 
52,000 
people 
directly 
and 
over 
250,000 
persons 
indirectly 
(16% 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the project 
area). 
The 
54 
municipalities 
were 
targeted 
based 
on: 
GoG’s 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy; watershed management 
priorities; 
presence 
and degree 
of 
vulnerability 
of 
biodiversity 
of 
global 
importance; 
and 
absence 
of 
other  large 
public 
or  donor-financed  projects 
with 
similar 
objectives. 
A 
minimum 
of 
60% 
of 
grant 
financing 
would 
go 
to 
households 
with 
less 
than 
1 hectare 
of 
land, 
and 
a 
minimum 
of 
30% 
to 
women. 
Direct 
beneficiaries 
of 
productive 
and 
natural 
resources management 
investment 
grants 
will 
primarily 
be 
poor 
rural 
farming 
households whose 
livelihood 
strategies 
are based 
on: 
(i) 
maize 
and bean 
production, 
generally 
on 
very small 
(< 
0.7 
ha) 
hillside 
plots;  and 
(ii) 
sales 
of 
seasonal 
labor 
in 
coastal 
plantations, 
small-scale vegetable 
and 
coffee 
production, 
and 
semi- 
and 
unskilled 
labor 
in 
larger 
towns 
and 
cities 
(or 
illegal 
emigration 
to 
the 
United 
States). 
Female-headed households 
in 
particular 
will 
be 
targeted. 
Other 
direct 
beneficiaries 
include 
farming 
households 
with 
up 
to 
10 hectares 
of 
land 
and 
micro-enterprises 
with 
potential 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
diversification 
of 
the 
local 
economy and 
job 
creation. 
Direct 
local 
benefits 
are expected 
to 
include: 
(i) 
increased 
household incomes among 
small 
farming 
and 
landless households 
and 
local 
micro-entrepreneurs; 
(ii) 
increased 
ability 
of 
local 
people 
and 
organizations 
to 
manage 
their 
own 
development programs 
and relations 
with 
central government 
and 
other 
institutions; 
and 
(iii) 
improved 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
leading 
to 
more 
sustainable 
and 
stable 
production 
systems 
and 
a 
more 
amenable 
environment 
for 
human 
habitation. 
At 
the 
regional 
and 
national 
levels, 
beneficiaries 
include private 
sector and 
NGO 
staff who 
will 
be 
provided 
with 
additional 
training 
and 
employment 
as 
service 
providers 
for 
project activities. 
Central, 
regional 
and 
departmental government 
agencies 
(MAGA, 
MARN, 
CONAP, 
and 
INAB) 
will 
benefit 
from 
strengthened 
capacity 
to 
manage 
decentralized 
development, 
technical 
training, 
improved 
relationships 
with 
indigenous communities, 
and 
replicable 
models 
for  rural 
development 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation. 
Downstream 
consumers 
of 
environmental 
services, 
particularly 
water, 
will 
also 
benefit 
by: 
(i) 
stabilizing 
forest 
cover 
and 
watersheds; 
(ii) 
demarcating 
and 
establishing 
community 
co-management 
plans 
for 
protected 
areas; 
(iii) 
improving 
local 
and national 
capacity 
to 
sustainably manage 
community 
forests and 
protected 
areas; 
(iv) 
improving 
government 
agency 
capacity 
to 
support decentralized 
development;  (v) 
developing 
incentives

Project 
Management: 
A 
Project Coordination 
Unit 
(PCU) 
will 
be 
established 
within 
MAGA, 
under 
Ministerial 
Decree, and 
it 
will 
be 
located 
in 
the 
project 
areas 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
to 
provide 
for 
overall 
coordination 
of 
component 
activities 
and 
carry out 
project 
management 
functions. Specifically, 
the 
PCU 
will 
be  responsible 
for 
implementation, 
the 
day-to 
day  coordinating 
among 
implementing 
agencies, 
coordination 
and 
promotion, 
preparation 
of 
annual 
work 
programs, 
budgets, 
procurement 
and 
financial 
management, general supervision,  and 
monitoring 
and evaluation. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
participating 
agencies, 
mainly 
through 
their 
regional 
offices  and 
local 
staff; 
no 
administrative 
management 
is 
involved. 
The 
PCU, 
managed 
under 
the 
responsibility 
of 
a 
project 
coordinator, 
will 
include: 
an 
administrative 
unit 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
financial 
and 
procurement 
management; a 
unit 
for 
component 
coordination 
with 
qualified 
technical 
staff 
coordinators 
of 
each 
project 
component; and a 
unit 
for Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation. 
Also, 
the 
PCU 
will 
be 
assisted 
by 
a 
part-time 
legal 
counsel 
(on 
retainer). 
The 
terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
head 
of 
the 
PCU 
and 
the  financial 
officer 
and 
the 
procurement 
specialist 
unit 
will 
be 
reviewed 
prior 
to 
negotiations.  Selection 
of 
the 
Coordinator 
and 
principal staff 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
effectiveness. 
An 
internal 
auditor, acceptable 
to 
the 
World 
Bank, 
will 
be 
selected 
prior 
to 
effectiveness. 
They 
will 
report 
to 
the project’s 
Executive 
Steering 
Committee. 
An 
Executive 
Steering 
Committee 
will 
be 
established, supported 
by 
a 
larger Technical 
Advisory 
Group 
(TAG), 
to 
be 
responsible 
for 
project 
oversight, 
policy 
setting 
and 
inter-institutional coordination 
within 
the production, 
natural 
resources 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
activities. 
The 
former 
would 
comprise the 
Ministers 
of 
MAGA 
and 
MARN 
and 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
overall 
project oversight 
and 
coordination, 
policy 
setting 
and 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
Annual 
Work 
Program. 
The 
latter 
would 
comprise 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
agencies 
(MAGA, 
MARN, 
CONAP, 
INAB) 
or 
their 
representatives 
with 
the 
PCU 
coordinator acting 
as 
the 
Technical 
Secretary. 
The 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
TAG 
would 
include,  among 
others, 
intra 
and 
inter- 
institutional coordination 
necessary 
for 
Project 
implementation 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
each 
of 
the 
four 
institutions’ 
annual 
work 
programs 
within 
the 
project. 
Project Operational 
Procedures: 
Project 
management 
and 
responsibilities 
will 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
Project Implementation 
Plan 
(PIP) 
and 
associated 
Operation 
Manual. 
The functions 
and 
responsibilities 
of 
the 
PCU, 
project 
management 
and 
all 
other 
aspects 
of 
project implementation 
and 
procedures 
will 
be 
governed 
by 
the 
Project Operational 
Manual, 
which 
will 
include 
detailed 
guidelines 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
POA, 
staffing 
and 
assignments 
with 
specific  responsibilities, 
supervision, 
community 
subproject 
guidelines 
and  procedures, 
environmental 
standards 
applicable 
to 
all 
production 
and  conservation 
investments and 
pilot 
projects, 
flow 
of 
funds, 
special 
accounts, 
budgeting, 
auditing 
and reporting, 
as 
well 
as 
procurement and 
disbursement procedures. 
The 
Operational 
Manual 
would 
be 
updated 
according 
to 
project 
circumstances  and 
project 
strategies, 
implementation 
experience  and 
project 
objectives, 
and 
activities 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
PAD 
and 
Project 
Legal 
Agreement. 
A 
Project Operational Manual, 
acceptable 
to 
the 
World 
Bank, 
will 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
Project Effectiveness. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Arrangements: 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
project 
results  and 
impacts 
are 
monitored.  Detailed  project 
performance 
monitoring 
indicators 
and  a 
draft 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
proposal 
have 
been 
prepared and was 
reviewed 
at  appraisal. 
A 
finalized 
version 
will 
made 
available 
prior 
to 
Project Negotiations. 
A 
Mid-Term 
Review 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
to 
provide 
an 
in-depth 
evaluation 
of 
project 
performance 
and  outcomes 
based 
on 
the 
agreed  targets 
presented 
in 
Annex 
1. 
Page  17

Procurement 
Arrangements: 
The 
bulk 
of 
the 
project 
funds 
will 
finance demand-driven 
subprojects 
that 
will 
be implemented 
by 
pre-existing, 
rural community 
associations 
in 
fifty-four 
municipalities. The 
PCU 
will 
coordinate 
project 
activities. 
It 
will 
also 
maintain 
a 
roster 
of 
pre-qualified 
service 
providers 
(for 
provision 
of 
goods, 
works 
and 
services), 
which 
will 
be 
upgraded frequently, 
to 
facilitate 
the 
contracting 
of 
these 
services 
by 
the  communities. 
There 
will 
be 
no 
prior 
review 
of 
contracts 
carried out 
by 
these 
community 
associations since 
that 
will 
include 
mostly 
contracts 
of 
small 
value. 
One 
or more qualified 
firms 
or individuals 
will 
be 
hired 
to 
provide 
procurement 
support 
and supervision and 
the 
PCU 
will 
carry 
out 
post 
reviews 
of 
sampled  subprojects 
every 
six 
months 
during 
at  least 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
implementation; 
including 
an  independent 
review 
every 
year. 
The 
frequency 
of 
post 
reviews 
and 
independent 
reviews 
may 
be 
reduced 
based 
on 
progress 
of 
project 
performance. Capacity 
assessment 
of 
municipalities, 
to 
assess 
their 
ability to 
administer 
funds, 
were 
carried out 
for 
the 
first 
18 
municipalities. 
Capacity 
assessment 
of 
the 
remaining municipalities 
will 
be 
conducted 
subsequently. 
It 
has 
been agreed 
that 
periodic 
procurement 
audits 
would 
be 
carried 
out 
for 
subprojects. 
TORS 
were 
reviewed 
at 
appraisal 
and 
will 
be 
finalized 
at 
negotiations.

Project Rationale: 
1. 
Project 
alternatives 
considered and 
reasons 
for 
rejection: 
Watershed 
management 
vs. 
cross-cutting 
thematic 
approach: 
The 
original 
GoG 
proposal 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
restricted 
the 
project 
focus 
to 
investments 
in 
specific 
watersheds. 
This 
was 
rejected 
as 
it 
hindered 
the 
Bank’s 
and 
GEF’s 
comparative 
advantages 
to 
work on 
cross-cutting 
issues 
in 
a 
number 
of 
equally 
critical 
and threatened 
watersheds. 
No 
single 
project 
or 
program 
can 
effectively 
address 
all 
the 
myriad 
multi-sectoral 
development 
and 
investment 
needs 
for 
an 
entire 
watershed. 
The 
targeted 
region 
requires 
provision 
of 
services 
which 
span 
several watersheds 
and 
whose  “boundaries” 
are 
better 
defined 
by 
administrative divisions 
(Le., 
municipalities). 
Of 
necessity, 
the 
project’s 
GEF-financed 
biodiversity 
and 
environmental 
services 
activities 
extend 
beyond 
single 
watersheds. 
Centralized, top down (cluster) 
vs. 
local 
initiative 
approach: 
An 
initial, 
centrally-determined, 
emphasis 
on 
agro-industrial 
and forestry 
investments 
within 
the 
concept 
of 
sectoral “clusters”  was advocated 
by 
the 
previous 
Government. 
It 
was 
strongly 
debated 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
Bank’s  commitment 
to 
rural 
poverty 
alleviation 
and 
collectively 
changed 
to 
support 
for 
small-scale 
farmers and entrepreneurs based 
on 
local 
initiative 
and demand-driven 
investments. 
Nevertheless, 
this 
does 
not 
imply 
that 
the 
commercial and 
market-oriented 
farm 
sector 
is 
excluded 
from 
project 
benefits. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
during 
preparation, 
studies 
on 
a 
number 
of 
promising 
commercial 
crops 
for 
promotion 
within 
regional, 
national 
and 
export 
markets 
(shade 
and 
organic 
coffee; 
fruits; 
vegetables; 
potatoes; cardamom) 
were 
carried out 
in 
reference 
to 
the 
National 
Competitiveness 
Program 
(and the 
Bank’s Competitiveness 
Project 
under preparation), 
and 
links 
to 
the 
Agricultural 
Export 
Promotions Agency 
- 
AGEXPRONT, 
with 
regional offices 
in 
Quetzaltenango, 
will 
be 
fostered 
as, 
and 
wherever, 
opportunities 
arise. 
Conservation 
vs. 
sustainable 
use 
approach: 
The 
option 
of 
focusing exclusively 
on 
environmental 
issues 
and 
activities and natural 
resource 
conservation 
was 
never 
a serious 
option 
for 
this 
project, 
given 
the 
pressing social 
needs 
in 
the 
region. 
The project, 
to 
be 
acceptable 
locally 
and 
nationally, 
needs 
to 
include 
a 
strong  productivity-enhancement 
element. 
Experience 
with 
similar 
projects 
in 
Guatemala  and  other 
countries 
clearly 
demonstrates 
that 
without 
the 
provision 
of 
financial 
and 
economic incentives 
to 
the 
rural 
poor, 
efforts 
to 
stimulate 
changes 
in 
behavior 
from 
unsustainable resource 
use 
and 
production 
practices 
will 
not 
prosper. 
Poor 
farmers  cannot 
risk 
changing 
their 
traditional production 
practices 
unless 
the 
alternative practices result 
in 
tangible 
benefits 
(e.g., 
improved productivity, 
income, 
food 
security). 
In 
the 
project 
area, 
the 
need 
to 
provide 
alternative 
(off-farm) 
income-generating opportunities 
to 
reduce pressure 
Page  18
Page 
14 
on 
natural 
resources 
has 
also 
been 
recognized. 
Bank-financed 
conservation 
projects increasingly 
adopt 
such 
combined 
production-conservation incentives 
mechanisms. 
Centralized 
vs 
decentralized technical 
services 
approach: 
In 
Guatemala, 
the 
provision 
of 
centralized 
government 
services 
as 
a 
means 
of 
implementing project activities 
was 
rejected 
as 
part 
of 
the 
movement 
and 
policies 
to 
modernize the 
state. 
However, 
downsizing 
of 
public 
institutions, 
decentralization 
and 
privatization 
of 
services 
has 
reduced the 
public 
sector 
to 
the 
point 
where  selective  investments 
in 
strengthening 
(reformed) 
public 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
facilitate 
local 
services 
is 
required. 
The 
project 
supports 
locally-identified 
and client-managed 
assistance 
to 
producer 
groups 
and 
municipal 
governments 
on 
a 
cost-sharing 
basis 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
centrally-driven 
extension 
services, 
although 
some 
regional 
government 
offices 
(MAGA, 
MAN, 
NAB, 
CONAP) 
will 
be 
eligible 
for 
targeted 
institutional 
strengthening, 
while 
avoiding 
rebuilding 
bureaucratic 
inefficiencies. 
Choice 
of 
Financing 
Mechanisms: 
During 
preparation 
a 
number 
of 
alternative 
rural 
financing 
mechanisms 
(RIMS) 
were 
considered, analyzed and 
weighed. 
They 
ranged 
from 
selecting 
among 
the 
existing 
social 
funds 
(FIS 
and 
FONAPAZ), 
environmental 
funds 
(FOGUAM 
and 
FONACOM), 
and 
sectoral 
funds 
(FONAGRO). 
All 
of 
them 
were 
rejected 
for 
a 
number 
of 
discrete 
reasons, 
namely: 
a) 
the 
social 
funds 
have 
no 
capacity 
for 
promoting 
and 
supervising 
productive, 
environmental 
or  natural 
‘resources 
management 
investments, 
neither 
technically 
nor 
administratively, 
nor 
do 
they 
have 
institutional 
links 
or 
incentives 
to 
embark 
on 
programmatic 
approaches 
to 
environmental 
or 
natural 
resources management; 
b) 
the 
other 
funds, 
while 
offering 
interesting 
options,  have 
in 
the 
past 
sufferedfrom 
undue 
political 
interference 
and, 
in 
any 
case, 
may 
be 
restructured 
under 
GoG’s 
initiative 
(supported 
by 
the 
Bank) 
to 
rationalize 
the 
country’s 
funding 
mechanisms. 
The 
choice 
was 
to 
utilize 
the 
PCU to 
implement 
the 
grant 
financing 
program 
(technically  and 
administratively) 
and 
to 
have  a 
separate 
disbursementhancia1 
administration 
service 
- 
the 
Administrator 
Agent 
(AA). 
The 
GEF 
has 
supported  several 
biodiversity 
conservation projects 
in 
Guatemala. 
The 
World 
Bank, 
as 
implementing 
agency, 
had 
one 
recent 
GEF 
project 
in 
Guatemala 
-- 
a 
mid-sized 
project 
for 
the 
conservation 
of 
Laguna del 
Tigre 
National 
Park 
in 
the 
PetCn. 
Through 
the 
UNDP 
as 
implementing 
agency, 
the 
GEF 
supports the 
RECOSMO 
project 
in 
nine 
protected 
areas 
in 
northeastern 
Guatemala, 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
National Biodiversity 
Strategy 
(through 
an 
Enabling 
Activity 
Grant), 
the 
Small 
Grants 
Program, and a proposed 
mid-sized project 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
with 
the 
NGO 
Helvetas.

Lessons 
learned 
and 
reflected 
in 
proposed 
project 
design: 
Natural 
Resource 
Management. 
Bank 
experience 
demonstrates 
that 
fundamental 
to 
the 
success 
of 
this 
type 
of 
program 
are: 
(i) 
long-term 
security 
of 
land 
tenure/resource 
access; 
(ii) 
assurance 
of 
local 
buy-in 
(ownership) 
of 
project activities coupled 
with 
strengthening 
of 
local 
management capacity 
in 
regards 
to 
the 
forests,  watersheds, 
land/soils,  habitats 
and 
biodiversity 
upon 
which 
people 
rely 
or 
live 
around; 
(iii) 
mechanisms 
for 
managing 
resource-demand 
and 
access 
conflict; 
(iv) 
decentralizing decisions and support 
systems 
responsive 
to 
local 
demands 
and 
needs; 
and 
(v) 
providing 
all 
actors 
with 
enhanced 
access 
to 
useful 
and 
up-to-date 
information, 
training 
and  technical 
assistance 
which 
expands 
the 
range 
of 
alternatives 
open 
to 
them. 
Project 
design 
builds 
on 
these 
principals 
and 
on 
the 
positive 
pilot 
community 
forestdnatural 
resources 
planning 
and 
management  experiences 
of 
local 
governments 
and 
NGOs 
(HELVETAS, 
Movi 
Mundo),  other international 
donors 
(GTZ), 
and 
GoG 
agencies 
(INAB/BOSCOM) 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
and 
supports 
mainstreaming 
these 
successful 
models 
within 
the 
GoG’s 
line

Extension 
programs 
worldwide 
are 
being 
decentralized 
and privatized 
and 
general management 
reforms 
are 
being 
introduced.  Successful 
rural

decentralized 
services, 
allowing 
for 
local 
innovation 
and 
adaptation 
in 
response 
to 
locally  identified 
needs; 
(ii) 
involve 
farmers 
in 
planning, 
implementing, 
and 
financing 
services 
to 
assure 
program 
relevance 
and 
effectiveness; 
(iii) 
emphasize 
involvement 
of 
producer organizations 
in 
providing 
services 
for 
small 
farmers; 
(iv) 
strengthen producer organizations; 
(v) 
provide 
alternatives 
from which 
farmers  can select 
and 
adapt 
the 
practices and 
systems 
most relevant 
to 
their 
conditions; 
(vi) 
link 
farmers 
to 
private 
sector 
activities 
in 
input 
sales 
and 
product 
marketing; 
(vi) facilitate 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
interactions 
at 
various 
levels between 
farmers, 
researchers, 
policy-makers 
and 
the 
private 
sector; 
(vii) 
make coordinated 
use 
of 
all 
available  communications 
channels 
(especially  radio) 
for 
efficiently 
and 
effectively  transmitting 
information; 
and 
(viii) 
include 
new 
technology  and 
adaptive  research 
as 
a 
complementary 
activity 
to 
extension, 
The 
above-mentioned 
lessons 
and prescriptions, 
are 
equally 
relevant 
to 
adaptive 
research, 
small 
enterprise 
support 
and agro-enterprise 
development 
activities 
and 
are 
included 
in 
the 
project 
design. 
An 
information  campaign, 
important 
to 
ensure 
transparency 
and 
effective 
dissemination 
of 
the 
program 
objectives, 
is 
incorporated 
in 
the 
project 
design. 
Productive 
subprojects 
must 
be 
subject 
to 
rigorous 
selection criteria, 
provide 
services 
for 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
community 
members, 
and 
assure 
operational 
sustainability 
and maintenance 
by 
establishing 
the 
collection 
of 
user 
fees 
where 
appropriate. 
Participation 
by 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
selection, 
financing, 
execution, 
and operation and maintenance 
of 
subprojects 
has 
ensured 
that 
investments 
meet genuine 
community 
needs, 
led 
to 
cost 
savings, 
and 
has 
increased 
community 
‘ownership’  leading 
to 
improved 
sustainability 
of 
investments. 
This 
methodology 
will 
be continued 
under 
the 
new 
project. 
Poverty 
targeting 
mechanisms 
that 
are 
simple, 
verifiable 
and 
based 
on 
objective 
criteria,  can  foster 
transparency, 
minimize  political 
interference 
in 
project 
resource 
allocation 
and 
ensure 
that  project 
resources reach 
the 
poorest 
areas. 
The 
project 
allows 
communities 
to 
self-select 
through the 
demand- 
driven 
mechanism 
for 
subprojects. 
Biodiversity 
Conservation. 
Through 
an 
extensive 
portfolio 
of 
GEF 
and 
World 
Bank 
biodiversity 
conservation 
projects 
in 
Central America, 
the 
Bank 
has 
solid 
experience 
in 
the 
execution 
of 
conservation 
projects 
in 
the 
region. Emerging 
lessons 
include: 
(i) 
the 
value 
of 
biological 
corridors 
to 
protect 
reserves 
that 
are 
otherwise 
“isolated  islands”; 
(ii) 
the 
importance 
of 
incorporating 
local 
communities 
and 
local 
governments 
into 
biodiversity 
conservation planning; 
(iii) 
the 
need 
for 
financial 
mechanisms 
to 
fully 
cover operational 
costs; 
and 
(iv) 
the 
importance 
of 
institutional 
strengthening 
of 
the 
agencies 
responsible 
for 
conservation. 
4. 
Indications 
of 
borrower 
commitment 
and ownership: 
In 
March 
2000, 
SEGEPLAN 
(GoG’s 
General 
Planning 
Secretariat)  endorsed 
the 
project 
concept 
as 
important 
for 
both 
sustainable development  and 
achieving 
goals 
set 
by 
the 
Peace 
Accords. 
In 
March 
2002, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
formally 
advised 
the 
Bank 
of 
its 
support 
for 
the 
proposed 
project 
and 
in 
December 
2002, 
the 
Minister 
of 
Finance 
confirmed 
that 
the 
project 
was a 
priority 
and 
that 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
would 
include 
adequate 
financing 
for 
the 
project 
in 
the 
national 
budget. 
MAGA, 
MARN, 
CONAP 
and 
INAB 
have 
demonstrated 
strong 
support 
for 
the 
project 
and have designated 
staff 
to 
assist 
in 
its 
preparation, 
as 
has 
the 
Minister 
of 
IMARN. 
The 
GEF 
Focal 
Point 
is 
the 
Minister 
of 
MARN, 
who 
provided 
an endorsement 
letter 
for 
the 
project 
proposal 
in 
January 2001.

Value 
added 
of 
Bank 
support 
in 
this 
project: 
The 
Bank 
supports 
a 
rich 
portfolio 
of 
natural 
resources 
management, 
forestry 
and 
communal 
forest 
management, watershed 
rehabilitation 
projects 
in 
several 
Central 
and South 
American 
countries, 
from 
which 
important 
lessons 
have 
been 
captured 
for 
application 
in 
this 
project.  The  current 
Guatemala 
portfolio 
includes related projects 
in 
land 
administration, 
local 
initiatives 
and 
municipal 
development, 
and 
social 
infrastructure (through 
its 
support 
to 
the 
Guatemala 
FIS 
and 
FONAPAZ). 
Biodiversity 
conservation: 
The 
Bank 
has 
wide 
experience and 
will 
help 
target 
project 
activities 
to 
zones 
of 
critical 
ecological importance and 
mobilize 
appropriate technical 
assistance. 
The 
Bank 
has 
been 
active 
in 
regional 
dialogue 
on 
environment, 
sustainable 
use 
and 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
MBC 
in 
Central 
America 
and 
Mexico 
and has 
many similar 
projects 
in 
the 
region. 
Demand-driven, competitive funds: 
The 
Bank 
supports 
agricultural 
extension, 
social 
infrastructure, 
rural 
investment 
programs  and 
natural 
resources management 
throughout 
the 
region. 
Sharing 
of 
experience 
from 
these 
other 
funds 
will 
greatly 
shorten 
the 
learning curve 
for 
establishing 
the 
financing 
mechanism 
for local 
institutional 
programs. 
Agricultural 
technology 
programs: 
The 
Bank 
has 
acquired 
broad 
experience 
with 
financing 
agribusiness development 
and producer 
and 
community 
organizations 
and 
can 
bring 
this 
experience 
to 
bear 
in 
project 
design 
and 
implementation. 
Land 
Administration 
and 
Land 
Funds: 
The 
Bank 
supports 
key 
projects 
in 
Guatemala’s 
rural 
sector: 
the 
Land 
Fund 
(Ln. 
4432-GT), 
Land 
Administration 
(Ln. 
441 
5-GT), 
and 
the 
Reconstruction 
and 
Local 
Development 
Project  (Ln4379-GT). 
Coordination 
among  projects 
has 
been 
discussed 
and 
opportunities 
for 
synergies have been 
identified. 
Natural 
resources 
conservation and watershed 
protection: 
The 
Bank 
finances 
many 
such projects 
worldwide. 
Experience 
from 
these 
initiatives 
has 
been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
project 
design, 
including 
good 
practices 
in 
private 
service 
provision 
and 
private 
sector 
development. 
Integration 
of 
production 
and 
conservation 
activities 
to 
encourage 
reduced 
environmental 
degradation; 
demand-driven 
priority 
setting 
and 
planning; 
support 
to 
“farmer” 
(client-driven) 
agendas 
for 
improved 
income  security 
versus 
“agency” 
(supply 
and 
centrally 
driven) 
agendas 
seeking 
conservation 
outcomes 
through 
non-sustainable 
external 
pressures. 
Environmental 
Services 
Markets: 
Although 
new 
for 
Guatemala, 
the 
World 
Bank 
is 
involved 
significantly 
in 
major 
environmental 
services 
projects 
or 
components 
in 
Mexico, 
Costa 
Rica, 
El 
Salvador, 
Belize, 
and 
Colombia. 
A 
network 
of 
experts 
and a web 
page 
with 
resources 
has 
been 
created. 
This 
area 
is 
one 
in 
which 
the 
Bank 
has 
developed 
cutting 
edge 
experience 
and 
thus 
is 
able 
to 
provide 
significant 
value-added. 
E. 
Summary 
Project 
Analyses 
(Detailed 
Assessments 
are 
in 
the 
project 
files, 
see 
Annex 
9) 
1. 
Economic 
(see 
Annex 
4a 
and 4b) 
The  project 
is 
expected 
to 
generate 
a 
variety 
of 
benefits, 
including 
building 
or 
strengthening 
social 
capital, 
increasing 
productivity 
in 
natural 
resource 
use 
(agricultural, 
forestry, 
off-farm, 
and 
tourism 
enterprises) 
in 
a 
sustainable manner, 
promoting biodiversity 
conservation, 
strengthening 
institutions 
at 
the 
central 
and 
local 
level 
in 
the 
agriculture 
and 
natural 
resource 
sectors, 
and 
contributing 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Peace 
Accords. 
The 
economic 
and 
financial 
analyses 
focus 
on 
the 
productive 
and 
Page  22
Page 
18 
natural 
resource management subprojects, 
which 
amount 
to 
about 
50% 
of 
total project 
costs, 
or 
about 
62% 
of 
World 
Bank 
financing. 
For 
other 
project 
activities, 
criteria 
are 
discussed 
to 
compare 
project 
costs 
to 
suitable benchmarks 
in 
terms 
of 
effectiveness 
or 
cost norms. 
As 
required 
under 
GEF 
financing 
guidelines, 
an 
Incremental 
Costs 
Analysis 
is 
also 
included 
(Annex 
4b). 
Over 
the 
five 
years 
of 
implementation, 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Guatemala 
to 
implement the 
types 
of 
new 
approaches 
envisaged 
in 
this 
project 
are 
estimated at 
US157 
million. 
Available 
baseline 
financing 
(e.g., 
government 
funds, 
World 
Bank 
and counterpart 
funding 
under 
the 
project) 
is 
on 
the 
order 
of US149 
million 
vis-a-vis 
the 
requested 
US8 
million 
of 
incremental 
GEF 
funds. 
A. 
Economic 
and 
financial 
analysis 
of 
the 
community 
subprojects 
A 
number 
of 
farm 
models 
were 
developed 
during 
preparation 
to 
evaluate 
the economic  and 
financial 
viability 
of 
the 
different 
types 
of 
subprojects 
that 
may 
be 
submitted 
for 
financing. 
Models 
were 
assessed 
both 
from 
the 
beneficiary 
point 
of 
view 
(Le., 
the 
financial 
assessment 
including 
grant 
financing 
at 
the 
applicable 
percentage), 
and 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
project 
as 
a 
whole 
(i.e., 
in 
economic 
terms). 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
models 
have 
benefit-cost ratios 
from 
1.0 and 2.0. 
The 
Net 
Present 
Value 
(NPV) 
evaluated 
at a 
12% 
discount rate 
ranges 
between 
US$4,000  and 
US$0.6 
million, 
or, 
in 
per 
family 
terms, 
between 
US560 
and US$21,500. 
Estimating 
aggregate 
measures 
of 
value 
for 
this 
sub-component 
faces 
the 
problem that 
the 
number 
of 
subprojects demanded 
for 
each 
sub-type 
is 
unknown 
ex-ante. 
To 
provide indicative 
benchmarks, a range 
of 
NPV 
was 
calculated, 
in 
the 
two 
extreme 
cases 
in 
which 
the 
entire 
demand concentrates 
in 
subprojects 
with 
the 
lowest, 
and 
highest 
individual NPV, 
respectively. 
Taking 
into 
account the 
subprojects’  cost and 
therefore 
the 
maximum 
number 
of 
subprojects 
that 
could 
be 
financed 
for 
the 
given 
sub-component 
budget, 
the 
aggregate 
NPV 
would 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of 
US$0.8 
million 
- 
US55 
million; 
NPV 
per 
family 
would 
correspondingly 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of US120 
to 
US$20,000, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
family 
benefited 
would 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of 
1,300 
to 
29,000. 
The 
number 
of 
subprojects 
that 
could 
be 
financed 
varies 
between 
25 
and 
1,190. 
For 
purposes 
of 
the 
analysis, 
it 
was assumed 
that 
some 
500 
projects 
worth 
an 
average 
of 
US$37,600 
each 
would 
be 
financed. 
€3. 
Other 
project 
activities 
Conservation 
subpro-iects: 
It 
was 
assumed 
that 
the 
demand 
for 
conservation 
activities 
will 
correspond 
to 
about 
20% 
of 
project 
resources, 
that 
the 
average 
conservation subproject 
would 
cost US$25,000  and 
would 
affect 
an 
average area 
of 
100 ha. Based 
on 
these 
assumptions, 
some 
250 conservation 
subprojects 
were projected 
to 
be 
financed over 
an 
area 
of 
25,000 
ha 
at a cost 
of 
US6.28 
million. 
The 
resulting 
cost 
of 
US250 
per 
ha 
would 
appear 
reasonable 
as 
compared 
to: 
PINFOR 
reforestation 
payments 
of 
US$1,600/ha 
over 
five 
years 
for 
reforestation; 
US$573/ha 
for 
PINFOR/PRODEFOR 
reforestation 
over 
five 
years; 
or 
US$20 
to 
US$46 
per 
hdyr 
for 
INAB 
incentives 
for 
sound 
forest 
management. 
Institutional 
strengthening 
(subcomponent  1 
b): 
Some 
US$5 
million 
would 
be 
made 
available 
for 
this 
subcomponent. 
Given 
the 
demand-driven 
nature 
of 
the 
fund 
allocation, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
know 
in 
advance 
how 
many 
and 
which 
municipalities 
would 
be 
benefited. 
However, 
assuming 
distribution 
of 
resources 
proportional 
to 
the 
population 
of 
the 
54 
municipalities 
included 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
this 
sub- 
component 
would 
provide 
an average 
of 
US$0.60 
per 
capita 
per 
annum. 
In 
1998, 
the weighted 
average 
of 
fiscal 
transfers 
to 
municipalities 
in 
the 
three 
departments 
of 
El 
QuichB, 
Huehuetenango 
and 
San 
Marcos 
was 
US20 
per 
capita, 
so 
that  the 
project 
would 
add a 
modest 
3% 
on 
average 
to 
the 
municipalities’ 
current 
transfer 
absorption 
levels. 
Biodiversity 
Conservation  (Component 
2): 
Total 
component 
cost 
is 
US6.34 
million; 
the 
expected 
outcome 
is 
improved 
protected 
area 
management and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
over 
an 
area 
of 
2,100 
square 
km. 
This 
gives 
a cost 
per 
square 
kilometer 
of 
some 
US$3,019, 
or US$604 
per 
annum 
for 
the

year 
project 
period. 
This 
cost 
compares 
reasonably 
well 
with 
typical 
costs 
of 
biodiversity 
conservation 
in 
the 
LAC 
region: 
according 
to 
a recent 
review 
(Castro 
and 
Locker, 
2000), 
biodiversity 
funding 
per 
square 
km 
in 
the 
region 
(in 
the 
period 
1990-1997) can be clustered 
in 
five 
broad 
ranges, 
comprised between 
a 
“low” 
US$O 
- 
US$30 
(or 
US$O 
- 
US$4.2 
per 
annum) range 
prevailing 
in 
countries 
such 
as 
Chile 
and 
Argentina,  and 
a 
“high” 
range 
of 
US$210 
to 
US$12,000 (or 
US$30 
to 
US$1,700 
per 
annum) observed 
in 
Colombia,  Ecuador, 
and 
much of 
Central 
America. 
The proposed 
project 
would 
then 
be 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
“high” 
range, 
which 
is 
not 
surprising 
for 
a 
country 
like 
Guatemala, 
where 
a 
combination 
of 
high 
biodiversity 
priorities, 
and 
of 
complex 
social, 
economic and 
institutional 
threats 
to 
biodiversity 
are 
likely 
to 
make 
costs 
of 
protection 
high 
in 
regional 
comparative 
terms. 
2. 
Financial 
From 
the 
beneficiary 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
subprojects, at 
the 
indicated co-financing 
ratios, 
have benefit-cost 
ratios 
exceeding 
2 
(a 
reasonable 
threshold 
to 
induce 
adoption). 
The 
range 
of 
NPV 
(in 
financial 
terms) 
was 
estimated 
with 
the 
approach described above (Le. assuming 
concentration 
of 
demand at 
the 
lower 
and 
higher 
end 
of 
the 
distribution 
of 
individual 
sub-project 
returns), and 
is 
between 
US$5 
million 
and 
US$90 
million. 
IRR 
were 
not 
calculated 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
in 
most 
subprojects 
of 
initial 
negative 
values 
of 
net 
benefits. 
Fiscal 
Impact 
The 
counterpart 
contribution 
for 
GoG 
to 
the 
project 
is 
US$8.6 
million 
over 
5 
years. 
The 
majority 
of 
these 
resources 
(US$6.0 
million) 
are 
for 
the 
Sustainable 
Livelihoods 
Component 
and a 
smaller 
portion 
is 
for 
administrative 
costs 
(US$1 
.O 
million), biodiversity 
(US$1.3 
million) 
and 
environmental 
services 
(US$0.4 
million). 
Incremental 
recurrent 
costs 
for 
expanded 
activities 
of 
MAGA, 
CONAP, 
MARN, 
and 
INAB 
would 
total 
about US$0.35 
million 
per 
annum. 
This 
represents 
6% 
percent 
of 
these 
institutions’ current 
operating budget 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
of 
some 
Q 
34 
million 
(US$4.7 
million). 
The required 
annual 
counterpart requirements 
for 
the 
Project 
represent 
about 
1.5% 
percent 
of 
the 
total 
MAGA 
budget. 
The 
fiscal 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
local 
resources 
is 
limited 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Finance 
has 
confirmed 
that, 
from 
their 
perspective, 
the 
required co-financing 
(amount and 
availability) 
present 
no 
problems. 
Tax 
revenue 
generation 
in 
Guatemala 
(9% 
of 
GDP 
in 
1997) 
is 
among 
the 
lowest 
in 
the 
LAC 
region, and 
is 
clearly insufficient 
to 
finance 
the 
required 
levels 
of 
development 
and 
public 
goods 
social 
services. 
The 
Bank 
is 
seeking 
commitment 
from 
the 
government 
to 
meet targets 
for 
higher 
fiscal 
revenue 
collection 
(12% 
by 
2002). 
This 
will 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
determine 
the 
sustainability 
of 
any 
expanded 
public 
investment 
in 
rural 
development 
and 
poverty 
alleviation 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
and 
the 
country 
at 
large. 
However, 
under 
assumptions 
of 
maintenance 
of 
current 
levels 
of 
rural 
development 
financing 
over 
the 
medium-term 
through 
GoG’s 
primary 
programs 
(e.g., 
FIS, 
FONAPAZ, 
FSDC) 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano, 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
the 
framework 
established 
by 
the 
project 
would 
enable 
the 
demand 
for 
local 
productive 
and 
natural 
resources  management 
financing 
to 
be 
articulated 
and 
financing 
from 
these 
existing 
sources 
to 
significantly 
fill 
that 
need. 
The 
average 
annual investments 
in 
local 
subprojects 
proposed 
by 
the 
project 
represent 
less 
than 
20% 
of 
the 
total rural 
development 
financing 
transferred 
to 
the 
project municipalities. 
3. 
Technical 
The project 
builds 
on 
proven 
approaches 
to 
promoting 
rural 
productivity 
increases, 
natural 
resources 
management 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation among the 
rural 
poor. 
Given 
the 
opportunity 
and 
access 
to 
reliable technical 
support, 
the 
rural 
poor 
have 
the 
capacity 
to 
identify 
their 
most 
pressing 
needs 
and 
develop 
innovative 
responses. 
Project 
preparation 
studies  have 
confirmed 
the 
availability 
of 
local 
resource management 
innovations 
that 
are 
financially 
viable 
and 
technically 
feasible 
(see 
Annex 
8). 
All

proposed 
subprojects 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
technical, 
economic and 
environmental 
analyses 
to 
better focus 
investment 
on 
the 
more promising 
opportunities. 
The 
institutional 
analysis and 
social 
assessment 
revealed 
a considerable  presence 
of 
local 
development 
services 
providers 
and 
NGOs 
active 
in 
the project 
area, 
which 
can 
be 
drawn upon 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
assigns 
a substantial 
implementation 
role 
to 
the 
municipal 
governments, 
most 
of 
which 
are 
not 
adequately 
prepared 
and 
equipped 
to 
promote 
and 
facilitate 
local 
development projects.  Substantial 
capacity-building 
support 
to 
the 
municipalities 
is 
anticipated 
in 
planning, 
project 
preparation, 
implementation and 
supervision, 
with 
support 
from 
the 
Instuncius 
Locules 
and 
Municipal 
Promoters. 
The 
municipal 
technical 
units 
(UTMs) 
will 
be 
strengthened, 
through 
the 
hiring 
and 
equipping 
of 
a 
Municipal 
Promoter, 
to 
be 
able 
to 
assume 
the 
continuing 
development and 
facilitation/implementation 
support 
of 
local 
projects. 
Technical 
support 
will 
be 
drawn 
from 
a 
multi-sector 
pool 
of 
qualified 
and 
registered 
technical 
service providers, made 
available 
upon 
demand and 
financed 
by 
the 
project. 
These 
experts 
will 
provide 
services 
to 
the 
municipal 
UTMs 
and  strengthen 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Municipal 
Promoters, 
Instuncius 
Locules 
and 
producer 
groups 
in 
planning,  production,  marketing, 
resource  conservation, 
protected 
area management, 
legal 
issues, 
and 
organization 
strengthening. 
4. 
Institutional 
During 
preparation, a 
set 
of 
exhaustive 
analyses 
of 
institutions 
and appropriate 
institutional 
arrangements 
were produced 
(see 
Annex 
8). 
GoG 
policy 
is 
to 
limit 
the 
role 
of 
central and 
regional 
public 
agencies 
to 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
functions  and 
to 
stimulate 
local 
governments, 
communities, 
civil 
society, 
NGOs 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
in 
providing 
many 
sectoral and 
rural 
development 
services. 
In 
the 
project 
area, 
central 
and 
regional 
government 
agencies 
(especially 
MAGA, 
MARN, 
CONAP, 
and 
INAB) 
would 
concentrate 
on 
facilitating, 
regulating, 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating project 
progress 
but 
play 
a 
very 
limited 
role 
in 
project 
implementation. 
Most 
implementation 
and execution 
of 
project activities 
and 
technical 
services 
would 
be 
procured 
through private 
sector 
providers, 
local 
NGOs, 
producer 
associations  and 
universities. 
4.1 
Executing 
Agencies 
MGA 
has 
coordinating offices 
in 
each 
of 
the 
participating 
departments, 
with 
small 
technical 
teams 
of 
some 
six 
professionals, responsible for 
facilitating 
and 
regulating regional 
agricultural 
investments. 
They 
have 
a 
nominal 
task 
of 
convening, 
supporting 
and 
strengthening 
grassroots 
farmer 
organizations 
to 
assume 
bottom-up 
development 
and 
natural 
resources management 
activities.  The 
project 
will 
assist 
MAGA 
to 
become 
effective 
in 
their 
mandated 
functions,  and 
give 
the 
regional 
offices 
the 
role 
of 
municipal-level 
coordinating/liaison 
and 
annual 
planning 
of 
internal institutional 
strengthening, 
as 
well 
as 
facilitating 
linkages 
between 
the 
PCU 
and 
the 
field 
activities. 
MRN 
was  created 
in 
early 
2001 
(Legislative 
Decree 
90-2000) 
as 
the 
institution 
responsible 
for 
the 
formulation 
of 
policy for 
conservation, 
environmental 
and 
natural 
resources 
protection 
and 
management. 
Implementation 
of 
that 
policy 
is 
to 
be 
carried out 
jointly 
with 
or 
through 
the 
relevant 
institutions 
and 
line 
Ministries. 
During 
its 
short existence, 
MARN 
has 
established departmental  delegations 
throughout the 
country, 
put 
in 
place 
municipal-level 
promoters 
in 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
project 
area 
municipalities, 
and 
established  a 
national 
network 
with 
NGOs 
and 
civil 
society  organizations 
active 
in 
environmental 
management. 
The 
project 
will 
assist 
MARN 
and 
its 
decentralized 
staff 
to 
strengthen 
their 
outreach 
to 
municipalities 
in 
areas 
of 
environmental 
management, 
planning 
and compliance. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
assist 
MARN 
to 
lead 
the 
elaboration 
of 
a 
National 
Strategy for 
Environmental 
Services. 
CONAP 
is 
a dependency 
of 
the 
Executive 
branch 
of 
government 
and 
is 
responsible 
for 
the 
management 
and administration 
of 
protected 
areas 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
nationwide. 
It 
currently 
has 
only 
one 
regional office 
within 
the 
project 
area 
(Quetzaltenango). 
Its 
capacity 
to 
oversee 
protected 
areas 
in 
the 
Page  25
Page 
21 
region 
is 
severely 
limited 
and 
will 
be 
built 
up 
with 
project 
resources 
(see 
Annex 
2). 
At 
the 
central 
level, 
CONAP 
is 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of  the project 
and promises 
to 
be 
a 
reliable 
and 
committed institutional 
partner 
and counterpart. 
It 
will 
be 
chiefly  responsible 
for 
the 
execution 
of 
the 
GEF-funded 
activities 
in 
protected 
areas. 
To 
balance interests 
at 
the 
central 
level, 
the 
project 
promotes 
a strategy 
of 
extending 
greater 
capacity 
to 
manage 
protected 
areas 
to 
municipalities. 
INAB 
is 
a deconcentrated agency 
of 
MAGA, 
whose mandate 
is 
to 
implement 
national 
forest 
policy 
and 
facilitate 
access 
to 
technical 
services and 
financial 
resources 
to 
private 
actors and 
producers and forest 
managers 
through 
a  reforestation/forest 
managemenuforest 
conservation 
incentive 
programs 
such 
as 
PINFOR 
at 
three 
levels: 
municipalities, 
communal 
forests, 
and 
private 
plantations. 
It 
maintains 
a presence 
in 
municipal 
forest 
management 
through 
joint 
municipalNAB 
extension 
offices 
(where 
significant 
forest 
resources 
exist), 
providing 
training 
and 
support 
to 
municipal 
forest management programs, 
and forest 
fire 
prevention 
and 
control. 
INAB’s 
participation 
in 
the 
project 
is 
important 
and 
would 
take 
place 
at 
all 
levels, 
working 
through 
its 
Regional 
Offices 
and associated 
municipal 
offices, 
which 
in 
turn 
will 
be 
enabled 
to 
assume 
more 
responsibility 
and 
control 
of 
regional 
forests. 
Municipal 
governments 
will 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
project 
execution. 
They 
are vested 
constitutionally 
with 
increasing development responsibilities, 
receive 
up 
to 
10% 
of 
the 
national 
budget 
in 
transfer 
payments, 
are 
nominally 
structured 
to 
be 
able 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
mandate 
through 
Municipal 
Technical 
Units 
(UTMs) 
with 
agricultural 
and 
environmental 
promotion, 
forest 
and 
water 
resources management, and 
planning 
functions, 
In 
most 
of 
the 
municipalities 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
the 
UTMs 
are 
rudimentary 
and weak. The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
municipalities 
logistically 
and 
technically 
to 
be 
equipped 
to 
prepare 
“municipal 
development 
agendas” 
which 
will 
ultimately 
form 
the 
basis 
for 
subproject 
identification 
and selection, 
and 
will 
aim 
to 
significantly improve 
the 
municipalities’ 
capacities 
to 
plan 
and execute 
these 
agendas 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
project. 
To 
assist 
in 
project 
implementation, 
a 
variety 
of 
technical 
services 
will 
be 
contracted. 
Typical 
of 
the 
entities 
and services 
that 
will 
be 
contracted 
are: 
ICTA 
is 
responsible 
for 
agricultural 
research 
in 
Guatemala 
and, 
like 
INAB, 
its 
regional 
offices 
have greater 
technical 
substance 
than 
does 
MAGA. 
It 
has 
a 
degree 
of 
autonomy 
and 
is 
less 
politicized 
than 
MAGA. 
Its 
services 
will 
be 
contracted 
as 
required 
in 
generation, 
validation 
and 
diffusion 
of 
new 
technologies and 
as 
technical 
reviewer 
of 
subprojects, 
as 
appropriate. 
Universities. 
Natural 
resources management 
is 
a 
new 
area 
for 
most 
of 
the 
national universities. 
However, 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
Universidad 
Rafael 
Landivar, 
which 
has 
regional 
branches 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
will 
be 
drawn upon for 
support 
in 
agricultural 
extension, research 
and specialized 
training 
and 
review 
of 
locally-generated technical  subproject 
proposals. 
Their 
services 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
project’s 
Registry 
of 
Qualified 
Service 
Providers and 
drawn 
upon 
as 
needed. 
Private 
entities 
which 
will 
be 
drawn upon 
include consulting 
firms, 
foundations, 
commercial 
enterprises, 
local 
NGOs, 
producer 
associations and 
organizations. 
Most 
of 
these 
entities, 
except 
for 
the 
transnational 
commercial 
enterprises, 
are 
fragile 
but 
of 
great 
importance 
for 
project 
implementation. 
They 
can and 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
strengthening 
and 
support 
in 
return 
for providing 
technical and 
management services 
to 
the 
project, 
as 
required. 
Financial 
and 
banking 
services 
are 
available 
in 
all 
departmental 
capitals, 
led 
by 
BANRURAL 
and 
BANCAFE. 
They 
manage a 
variety 
of 
development 
funds 
and 
trust 
funds 
on 
behalf 
of 
NGOs 
active 
in 
the  region.  There 
are  also 
private 
entities 
which 
support  micro-enterprise 
support 
programs 
(e.g., 
FAFIDES 
and 
Genesis 
International)  and 
many 
bancos 
comunales 
in 
the 
region, 
particularly 
in 
Huehuetenango. 
During 
project 
implementation, 
based 
on 
a 
prior 
analysis, 
links 
with 
some 
of 
these 
private 
entities 
to 
leverage resources and 
support 
to 
the 
project 
would 
be 
sought.

Technical 
services 
have 
historically 
been 
limited 
in 
the 
region, 
however 
the 
policy 
shift 
in 
recent 
years 
to 
decentralized and 
privatized 
public 
services 
has 
encouraged 
the 
formation 
and increased 
the 
supply 
of 
Page  26
Page 
22 
service 
providers 
(private, 
NGO, 
farmer’s  organizations). 
As 
yet 
their 
presence 
is 
concentrated 
in 
the 
departmental 
capitals.  One 
entity 
with 
significant potential 
to 
the 
project 
is 
the 
Asociacidn 
Gremial 
de 
Exportadores 
de 
Productos 
no 
Tradicionales 
(AGEXPRONT) 
with 
a 
long 
established 
office 
in 
Quetzaltenango 
and 
currently 
establishing 
departmental 
offices, 
including 
within 
the 
project 
departments. 
It 
facilitates 
the 
association 
of 
agricultural 
produce 
exporters 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
exchange 
of 
market 
and 
production 
information, 
needs, 
and problems, and 
provides 
services 
in 
commercial 
information 
analysis 
and 
diffusion, 
training 
and 
technical 
assistance, 
and 
marketing. 
Its 
services 
are 
available 
to 
any 
kind 
of 
producer 
and 
marketing 
groups, 
and 
in 
the 
project 
area 
has 
had particular 
success 
in 
working 
with 
small, 
poor 
producers and 
marketing regional 
handicrafts 
abroad. 
It 
has 
been 
a 
pioneer 
in 
the 
development, 
promotion 
and 
marketing 
of 
organic 
and other 
types 
of 
“certified” 
agricultural 
and 
horticultural 
products. 
This 
organization 
will 
be 
drawn 
upon 
to 
provide 
training 
in 
business, 
marketing 
and other cross-cutting 
strategic services 
for 
small 
farmers 
and 
local 
development 
planning. 
4.2 
Project 
Management 
The 
execution 
of 
the 
project 
would 
be 
decentralized 
through 
the 
PCU,  supported 
by 
the 
participating 
agencies 
regional 
and 
local 
staff, together 
with 
the 
Instancias Locales 
(which 
include the 
UTMs). 
The 
latter 
entity 
will 
be 
defined 
flexibly 
in 
each 
Municipality 
to 
draw 
upon 
already 
existing 
entities 
(e.g., 
municipal 
and 
traditional 
authorities, 
Environmental 
and 
Development 
Committees; 
auxiliary 
mayors 
and 
other 
local 
stakeholders). 
In 
substance, 
they 
would 
function 
as 
the 
Consejos 
de 
Desarrollo 
Municipales 
‘sub-committee’ 
where 
productive 
and 
natural 
resources interests 
are 
represented 
and 
articulated, 
and 
priorities 
are negotiated. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
ensuring that 
the 
development 
of 
the 
project’s 
Annual 
Plan 
includes 
the 
relevant 
inputs 
from 
the 
municipal 
development 
agendas 
and 
project 
area 
stakeholder 
consultations. 
4.3 
Procurement 
Issues 
A 
procurement  capacity 
assessment 
of 
the 
Project 
Preparation 
Unit 
at 
MAGA 
was 
carried out 
and 
approved 
by 
the 
RPA’s 
office 
on 
March 
14, 
2003. 
The 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
is 
considered 
HIGH. 
It 
is 
recommended 
that 
the 
Bank provide 
close 
procurement 
supervision, 
especially 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project  implementation. 
It 
is 
expected  that 
by 
the 
second 
half 
of 
this 
year 
the 
Bank 
will 
have  a 
procurement  specialist  permanently 
in 
Guatemala 
who 
will 
facilitate 
closer 
assistance. 
The 
risk 
is 
expected 
to 
reduce 
with 
time 
as 
experience 
is 
gained 
by 
the 
PCU. 
Risk 
factor 
will 
be 
reassessed 
after 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project implementation 
and 
the 
risk 
assessment 
will 
then 
be 
upgraded 
if 
appropriate 
(See 
Annex 
6). 
4.4 
Financial 
Management 
Issues 
Assessment. 
As 
the 
PCU 
is 
to 
be 
created under 
the 
project, the 
Bank’s 
financial 
management 
assessment 
concluded that 
MAGA 
did 
not 
have 
in 
place 
an adequate 
financial 
management 
system 
for 
the 
project. 
It 
was agreed 
that 
MAGA 
would 
implement 
the recommendations 
in 
the 
action 
plan 
included 
in 
this 
report, 
to 
ensure 
that 
an 
adequate 
financial 
management 
system, 
acceptable 
to 
the 
Bank, 
will 
be 
in 
place 
by 
effep’tiveness.  Some 
of 
the 
key 
recommendations 
in 
the 
action 
plan 
are: 
(a) 
hire 
qualified 
financial, 
procurement, 
and 
administrative 
staff; 
(b) 
hire 
of 
an 
internal auditor 
and contract 
the 
external 
auditors; 
(c) 
develop 
the 
project 
operational 
manuals, 
including 
the 
administrative 
and  subproject  manuals; 
(d) 
contracting 
of 
qualified 
consulting 
firms/NGOs/Associations 
for 
the 
strengthening 
of 
community 
organizations 
and 
NGOs 
implementing 
subprojects, 
though 
training 
in 
financial, 
procurement, 
monitoring, 
and 
proposal 
and 
reporting 
preparation 
procedures; 
(e) 
implement 
a 
accounting 
information 
system; 
(f) 
a 
system/ 
controls 
for 
the 
monitoring 
of 
physical 
progress 
of 
project 
activities; and 
(g) 
contract 
the 
Administrator 
Agent 
(See 
Annex 
6).

To 
ensure 
adequate 
flow, 
transparency, 
efficiency, 
and 
opportune 
disbursement 
of 
project 
funds, 
MAGA 
and 
the 
participating 
implementing 
institutions 
have 
agreed 
to 
hire 
the services 
of 
an 
Administrator Agent 
(AA). 
The 
AA 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
custody 
of 
funds 
transferred 
from 
the 
Special 
Accounts 
(SA) 
provided 
through 
the 
loan 
and 
grant 
agreements, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
counterpart 
funds; 
making 
the 
disbursements 
approved 
by 
the 
PCU; 
and 
ensuring 
that 
these 
disbursement 
follow 
procurement  and 
disbursement  procedures 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. 
The 
specific 
entity 
to 
be 
contracted 
as 
the 
AA 
was 
identified 
by 
MAGA 
as 
“CIPREDA” 
from 
among 
the 
firms 
whose 
capacity 
to 
meet 
World 
Bank 
requirements 
had 
been 
previously verified; 
these 
were 
UNDP, 
IICA, 
and 
CIPREDA. 
(Centro 
de 
Cooperacidn 
Internacional 
para 
la 
Preinversidn, 
Agricola), 
is 
an 
intenational organization 
created pursuant 
to 
a 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding 
dated 
April 
10, 
1997, 
signed 
between 
MAGA 
and 
the 
Mexican 
Secretariat 
for 
Agriculture, 
Livestock 
and 
Food. 
According 
to 
the 
Acuerdo 
Gubernativo 
No. 
242-2000, 
MAGA 
may 
enter 
into 
direct 
agreements 
with 
CIPREDA 
for 
purposes 
of 
fund 
administration 
of 
its’ 
programs. 
The 
costs 
of 
CIPREDA 
will 
be 
paid 
from 
GoG 
counterpart 
funds 
for 
administration 
of 
both 
the 
loan 
and the 
GEF 
grant. 
A 
Financial 
Management 
Assessment 
of 
CIPREDA 
was 
completed 
prior 
to 
negotiations.. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
financial 
management 
assessment 
of 
CIPREDA 
indicated that 
it 
has 
demonstrated experience and 
capacity 
in 
the 
management 
of 
funds 
for 
projects 
funded 
by 
international 
donors 
and the 
GoG. 
Prior 
to 
its 
contracting,  several 
specific 
requirements 
identified 
in 
the 
assessement 
will 
be 
be 
met. 
The 
contracting 
of 
the 
Administrative 
Agent 
is 
a 
condition 
of 
Loan 
Effectiveness. 
Any 
possible 
issues 
arising 
from having 
the 
PCU 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
and 
an 
AA 
in 
Guatemala 
City 
will 
be 
addressed 
in 
the 
AA 
agreement. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
accounting 
and 
financial 
management 
of 
all 
project 
resources, 
including 
signing 
contracts, 
authorizing 
payments, 
approving 
disbursement 
of 
funds 
to 
be 
paid 
by 
AA, 
consolidating project 
accounts and 
information, 
budgeting, 
preparing 
financial 
reports, and 
establishing 
internal 
controls, 
reporting 
to 
the 
Bank 
and 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
. 
CIPREDA 
Counterpart 
contribution. 
MAGA 
will 
ensure, 
until 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
Project, 
that the required 
counterpart 
funds 
are 
incorporated 
in 
the 
GoG 
budget, 
including 
the 
financing 
for CIPREDA, 
and 
follow- 
up 
the 
opportune 
transfer 
of 
funds 
to 
the 
Project, 
and 
will 
coordinate 
with 
the 
participating implementing 
institutions 
that 
the 
agreed 
counterpart 
contribution 
is 
included 
in 
their 
annual budgets 
and 
that 
the 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
project 
account opened 
by 
the 
AA, 
which,  according 
to 
the 
current 
MHCP’s 
procedures, 
would 
be 
monthly, 
or 
at least 
on 
a 
quarterly 
basis. 
The 
required 
counterpart 
contribution 
of 
the 
project’s 
first 
year 
of 
execution 
is 
estimated 
to 
be 
approximately 
US$740,000, 
which 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
revised 
MAGA’s 
budget 
to 
be 
submitted 
to

this analysis. 
Summarize the 
steps 
undertaken 
for 
environmental 
assessment 
and 
EMP 
(including 
consultation 
During 
project 
preparation 
an 
environmental 
analysis 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
(see 
Infoshop: 
Analisis 
Ambiental General 
del 
Altiplano 
Occidental 
de 
Guatemala 
del 
Proyecto 
MIRNA) 
was 
conducted 
(Annex 
12). 
The analysis 
finds 
that 
environmental 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
proposed 
project 
are 
minimal 
and 
that 
overall  impact 
should 
be 
expected 
to 
be 
highly 
positive 
for 
land, 
watershed, 
forest 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation. 
5.2 
What 
are 
the 
main 
features 
of 
the 
EMP 
and 
are 
they 
adequate: 
The 
principal 
features 
of 
the 
environmental 
analysis  and 
mitigation 
plan 
include: 
(i) 
analysis 
of 
environmental 
challenges 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano, 
their 
causes 
and 
possible 
mitigating 
measures 
(CODERSA 
2000); 
(ii) 
preliminary 
environmental 
screening 
criteria 
and 
procedures 
for 
application 
in 
the 
subprojects 
review 
and 
approval 
process, 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
Project Operational 
Manual 
(screening 
will 
take 
place 
at 
several 
levels 
and 
times 
during 
subproject 
preparation: 
in 
the 
field 
with 
the 
beneficiary 
and 
Promoter/Extension 
agent, 
at 
the 
municipal-level 
with 
the 
Instancia 
Local 
and, 
depending 
on 
the 
size 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
subproject, 
by 
higher 
level 
technical/environmental 
experts); 
(iii) 
a 
negative 
list 
of 
subprojects 
which 
will 
not 
be 
financed 
on 
environmental 
grounds; 
(iv) 
a 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
program 
with 
detailed project 
performance, 
compliance 
and 
impact indicators; 
and 
(v) 
supervision 
and 
oversight 
procedures 
which 
would 
provide 
early 
warning 
and 
trigger immediate 
responses 
to 
potentially 
negative 
environmental 
impacts. 
Given 
the 
objectives 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
project, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
fact 
that 
most 
investments 
will 
improve 
and 
rehabilitate environmental 
quality 
and conserve 
natural 
resources, 
the 
measures 
summarized 
above 
are 
considered 
to 
be adequate.

Page  29
Page 
25 
objectives  and 
design 
were 
carried  out 
at 
several 
levels 
during 
project 
preparation, 
including: 
(i) 
a 
comprehensive 
Social 
Assessment 
over the 
six 
Western 
Altiplano 
Departments 
(see 
Annex 
13); 
and 
(ii) 
additional 
stakeholder  consultations 
with 
national 
and 
regional 
stakeholders 
with 
regional 
mayors, 
auxiliary 
mayors and 
NGOs 
(see 
project 
files). 
Stakeholder 
groups consulted 
during 
project preparation 
and pre-appraisal 
include: Plan 
de 
Acci6n

as 
well 
as 
mayors, 
auxiliary 
mayors, 
Mayan 
spiritual 
leaders, 
representatives 
of 
local 
catholic 
and protestant 
development 
organizations,  leaders 
of 
local

committees,  representatives 
of 
local 
and 
national 
NGOs, 
and 
community 
members 
(including 
men, 
women, 
and 
elders). 
Provision 
will 
also 
be 
made 
in 
the 
Project  Operational 
Manual for 
subproject-level 
environmental 
screening and 
consultations 
(e.g., 
by 
the 
Instancia 
Local, 
representing 
local 
community 
and 
municipal 
interests), 
as 
a 
condition 
for 
financing. 
The 
Project Operational 
Manual 
will 
be 
further 
reviewed 
with 
target and 
stakeholder groups 
prior to 
project 
effectiveness 
with 
additional 
refinements 
made based 
on 
the 
outcomes 
of 
these 
discussions. 
5.5 
What mechanisms have 
been 
established 
to 
monitor 
and 
evaluate 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
project 
on 
the 
environment? 
Do 
the 
indicators reflect 
the objectives 
and 
results 
of 
the 
EMP? 
The 
Environmental 
Analysis 
found 
the 
proposed 
project 
to 
have 
positive 
impacts 
on 
the 
environment and 
natural 
resources 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
Compliance 
with 
Bank 
and 
GoG 
environmental 
assessment 
requirements 
would 
be 
assured 
in 
that: 
(i) 
independent 
technical reviews 
of 
all 
subprojects 
would 
assess 
potential 
environmental 
impacts 
as 
required 
given 
the 
size  and/or 
nature 
of 
the 
subproject  and 
implementing 
agencies 
would 
be 
required 
to 
screen 
subproject 
proposals 
for 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
management 
provisions 
prior 
to 
approval; 
(ii) 
implementing 
agencies 
would 
coordinate 
monitoring 
of 
subproject 
compliance 
with 
environmental 
mitigation 
measures 
and 
report 
on 
environmental 
impacts 
of 
subprojects; 
(iii) 
a 
set 
of 
basic 
environmental indicators 
has 
been 
established 
for 
monitoring 
subprojects,  a 
negative 
list 
identifies 
types 
of 
ineligible 
subprojects; 
and 
(iv) 
all 
these 
procedures 
are 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
environmental 
management 
specifications 
of 
the 
Project Operational 
Manual.

6.1 
development outcomes. 
Summarize 
key 
social 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
project 
objectives, 
and 
specih 
the 
project’s 
social 
Any 
project 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
must 
accommodate and 
build 
on 
the 
strengths 
of 
local 
cultural 
diversity. 
The 
development 
goals and 
cultural relationship 
to 
land 
and resources 
of 
indigenous 
(90-95% 
of 
total) 
and 
ladino 
(5-10% 
of 
total) 
residents 
will 
be 
reflected 
in 
subproject proposals 
they 
submit. 
The 
presence 
of 
communal 
resource management 
systems 
and 
sacred 
areas, 
high 
levels 
of 
poverty,  and 
local 
impacts 
of 
civil 
war 
will 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
project implementation. The 
issues 
outlined 
below 
are 
of 
primary 
concern and 
have 
been 
incorporated 
into 
project 
design: 
Indigenous peoples 
(see 
Annex 
11): 
The 
indigenous people 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
belong 
to 
13 
ethno- 
linguistic 
Mayan 
groups.

most 
towns 
the 
indigenous 
population 
is 
bilingual, 
in 
many 
of 
the 
outlying 
communities, 
Spanish 
is 
spoken at 
only 
at a 
rudimentary level. 
Women 
and 
older 
people 
are 
more 
likely to 
speak 
only Mayan 
languages. 
The 
project 
will 
provide culturally 
appropriate 
(bilingual, 
as 
much 
as 
possible) 
technical 
assistance 
to 
farmer 
and 
artisan 
groups 
and 
community 
forest 
management 
committees 
(along 
with 
all 
other  stakeholders) 
to 
stimulate 
increased 
productivity 
and conservation 
of 
natural 
resources. 
Funds 
have 
been 
made 
available 
to 
the 
planning 
team 
to 
prepare 
technical 
information

project 
implementation. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
project 
will 
respect 
ladino 
culture 
and 
promote 
ladino 
participation 
in 
the 
project. 
Historically, 
indigenous 
peoples  have 
been 
mistrustful 
of 
government 
agency  representatives, 
and 
government 
agencies have 
not 
placed 
trust 
in, 
or 
invested 
in 
improving, 
the 
capacity 
of 
indigenous 
communities. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
and 
the 
Indigenous 
People’s 
Development 
Plan 
recommend 
trust- 
building 
learning activities 
between 
indigenous 
peoples and 
government 
agencies. These 
will 
be 
included 
in 
the 
project 
institution-strengthening activities, especially 
at 
the 
municipal 
and 
local 
levels. 
Gender: 
Female-headed households 
are 
very 
common 
in 
the 
rural 
Western 
Altiplano, 
making 
it 
important 
that 
the 
project 
provide 
special support 
to 
their 
productive 
capacities. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
presents 
findings 
and  recommendations 
focused 
specifically 
on 
the 
role 
of 
women 
in 
natural 
resources 
management and 
production. 
The 
project 
fosters 
women 
as 
equal 
agents 
of 
change, 
innovation 
and project 
implementation. 
Rural 
women’s 
productive 
and 
natural 
resources management 
(e.g., 
soils, 
forest 
and 
watershed  management) 
activities 
will 
be 
eligible 
for 
grant-financed 
subprojects, 
as 
will 
efforts 
and 
programs 
to 
facilitate 
their 
participation 
in 
(culturally 
appropriate) 
decision-making 
and 
planning 
forums. 
During 
project 
preparation, 
additional 
funds 
were acquired 
to 
enhance 
the 
gender 
focus 
of 
the 
project. 
Post-conflict  reconstruction: 
Decades 
of 
violence 
have 
strained 
the 
social 
fabric 
of 
Western 
Altiplano 
communities. 
The 
project 
will 
contribute 
to 
rebuilding 
social capital 
in 
the 
region 
by 
(i) 
strengthening 
existing 
traditional 
and 
other 
local 
organizations; 
(ii) 
supporting 
local 
leadership  development; 
(iii) 
providing 
access 
to 
project 
benefits 
without 
prejudice 
to 
ex-combatants, 
returned 
refugees, 
ex-civil 
patrol 
members 
and others 
who 
remained 
in 
their 
communities 
during 
the 
violence; 
(iv) 
fostering 
participatory 
decision-making 
in 
regard 
to 
project implementation 
and 
conflict 
management 
and 
providing training 
and 
technical 
assistance 
as 
needed; 
(v) 
working 
at 
the 
community 
and 
municipal 
levels 
and 
with 
other 
local 
demand-driven 
development 
approaches; 
(vi) 
strengthening 
or 
building 
local 
capacity 
for 
self- 
development  and 
stimulating 
active 
engagement 
in 
problem-solving; 
(vii) 
providing 
opportunities 
for 
local 
community 
co-management 
of 
protected 
areas 
and 
for 
planning 
and 
implementing 
grant 
financed 
subprojects; 
and 
(viii) 
fostering 
better 
relations 
between 
indigenous 
and 
ladino 
populations 
and 
government 
officials 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
rebuild 
trust 
between government 
and 
civil 
society 
in 
the Western 
Altiplano. 
Resettlement: 
The 
project 
will 
not 
finance any 
involuntary 
relocation 
of 
people 
as 
defined 
in 
the Bank’s 
operational 
directive 
on 
involuntary 
resettlement 
(OD 
4.30). 
A 
Process 
Framework 
providing 
guidelines 
for 
addressing 
potential 
adverse 
economic impacts 
is 
available 
(in 
Spanish) 
through 
the 
Bank’s 
Infoshop 
(see 
Annex 
8). 
6.2 
Participatory 
Approach: 
How 
are 
key 
stakeholders 
participating in 
the 
project? 
The 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
be 
responsive 
to 
local 
needs 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
beneficiaries. 
Local 
self- 
development 
is 
supported 
through beneficiary identification, 
design, 
and 
implementation 
of 
subprojects. 
The 
sustainability 
of 
local 
organizations’ 
ability 
to 
continue 
the 
type 
of 
activities 
and  technologies 
supported 
by 
the 
project 
is 
buttressed 
through 
the 
project’s 
local 
organizational 
strengthening 
initiatives. 
In 
project 
preparation; 
Representatives 
of 
stakeholders  at 
all 
levels 
(e.g., 
GoG, 
municipal 
mayors, 
community  auxiliary 
mayors, 
producer 
cooperatives  and  associations, 
communal 
forest 
management 
committees, 
local 
pro-development 
committees, 
Mayan 
elders, 
women’s  groups, 
and 
small local 
NGOs) 
participated 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
project through 
a 
series 
of 
local 
stakeholder/beneficiary 
workshops 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
subsequent 
consultations and 
verification 
meetings, 
and 
in 
field 
visits. 
Page  31
Page 
27 
In 
project 
implementation: 
All 
subprojects 
will 
be 
based 
on 
community-driven 
development 
initiatives, 
with 
stakeholders  and 
beneficiaries  active 
in 
their 
planning 
and 
implementation. 
Protected 
area 
management and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
activities 
necessarily 
require 
strong 
local 
involvement 
and 
will 
draw 
on 
local 
knowledge 
and indigenous 
resource management 
practices 
and experience. 
All 
activities 
will 
be 
designed 
to 
ensure 
the 
participation 
of 
community 
organizations 
and 
other 
civil 
society 
groups 
(e.g., 
Mayan 
elders, 
ex-combatants,  women,  and  displaced  peoples). 
Much 
of 
the 
support 
services 
provided 
to 
these 
beneficiary 
groups 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
local 
firms 
and 
NGOs. 
Zn 
project 
oversight 
and 
monitoring: 
Stakeholders 
will 
also 
participate 
in 
project 
oversight 
and 
guidance, 
help 
assure 
transparency 
of 
project 
objectives 
and activities, 
and 
monitor 
project 
outcomes 
through their 
representatives 
on 
the 
Technical 
Advisory 
Group 
and 
municipal-level 
Znstancias 
Locales, 
In 
project 
monitoring  and 
evaluation: 
Impacts 
of 
the 
subprojects 
and 
the 
institutional 
strengthening 
activities 
supporting 
them 
will 
be 
measured 
through  participatory 
monitoring 
based 
on 
indicators 
discussed 
and 
designed 
by 
direct 
beneficiaries 
and 
within 
the 
Agendas 
Municipales 
de 
Desarrollo 
Sostenible 
and 
the 
Znstancias 
Locales. 
The 
impacts 
of 
conservation 
activities financed 
under 
the 
project 
will 
be measured 
through participatory 
monitoring 
by 
the 
most immediate beneficiaries 
of 
these 
activities 
(e.g., 
the 
communal 
forest and protected 
areas 
committees 
and 
members 
of 
adjacent 
communities) 
as 
well 
as 
through 
data 
gathering 
among 
indirect 
beneficiaries 
(e.g., 
downstream water 
users). 
6.3 
organizations 
? 
How 
does 
the 
project 
involve  consultations 
or 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
or 
other 
civil 
society 
A 
wide 
variety 
of 
actors 
participated 
in 
project 
preparation,  and 
the 
consultative 
and 
collaborative 
processes 
used 
in 
that 
phase 
will 
be 
maintained 
throughout 
project 
implementation 
as 
part 
of 
project 
monitoring 
and 
on-going collaborative 
efforts. 
As 
part 
of 
preparation, a 
multidisciplinary 
team 
carried out 
an analysis 
of 
local 
stakeholders 
and 
held 
regional 
consultation workshops and focus groups 
with 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
local 
stakeholder representatives 
(e.g., 
communal 
forest 
managers, 
selected mayors, 
auxiliary 
mayors, 
indigenous 
leaders, 
women, 
and 
Mayan 
and 
ladino 
community 
representatives) 
in 
the 
departments 
of 
Sololi, 
QuichB, 
San 
Marcos, 
Huehuetenango, and 
Quetzaltenango 
(see 
Annex 
8). 
The 
input 
of 
producer 
associations  was 
solicited through 
consultations 
with 
RADEAS 
(department-level 
producer 
associations) 
and 
through 
field 
visits 
with 
producer 
association leaders. 
Consultations 
were 
also 
held 
with 
COPMAGUA 
(a 
national 
indigenous 
organization), 
ASOREMA 
(the 
coordinating 
board 
for 
NGOs working 
in 
environmental 
and 
sustainable 
development 
issues), 
private 
sector 
producer 
associations 
(AGEXPRONT, 
ANACAFE, 
Quetzaltenango 
regional 
potato  producers 
association), 
and 
key 
national 
and 
international 
NGOs 
(PAF-Maya, 
Saq’be 
Ixil, 
PRODESAGRO, 
Defensores 
de 
la 
Naturaleza, 
Caritas 
parochial 
rural 
assistance 
offices, 
HELVETAS, 
CARE, 
CRS, 
UNDP) 
through 
individual 
meetings 
and through 
workshops. 
Project 
experience 
and 
lessons 
from 
many 
NGOs 
working 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
were 
also 
incorporated 
into 
the 
project 
design. 
TNC 
and 
FLACSO 
collaborated 
directly 
in 
the 
design 
process. 
Coordination 
and, 
where 
possible, 
collaboration 
with 
NGOs 
working 
in 
the Western 
Altiplano 
will 
be facilitated 
through periodic 
meetings 
as 
agreed 
during 
the project’s 
stakeholder 
consultation workshop 
in 
September 
2000. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
technical 
and 
institutional 
strengthening  services 
contracted 
through project 
funds 
will 
be 
provided 
by 
qualified 
NGOs 
and 
other 
civil 
society organizations 
(see 
below 
and 
Annex 
2). 
6.4 
development 
outcomes? 
What 
institutional 
arrangements 
have 
been 
provided 
to 
ensure  the 
project 
achieves  its 
social 
The 
results 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
are 
incorporated 
into 
the 
project 
design and 
will 
contribute 
to 
achieving social 
development 
outcomes 
in 
the 
following 
ways: 
(i) 
the project’s  entire 
Page  32
Page 
28 
approach 
is 
community- 
and  demand-driven; 
(ii) 
financing  priorities 
will 
be 
established 
locally 
by 
representative 
bodies constituted of 
local 
stakeholders; 
(iii) 
the 
central-level oversight 
mechanism 
will 
include 
the 
participation 
of 
civil 
society representatives; 
(iv) 
attention 
to 
collaborative decision-making 
and 
conflict 
management 
will 
strengthen 
civil 
society and 
improve 
cohesion 
within 
communities; 
and 
(v) 
the 
strengthening 
of 
traditional 
and other 
existing 
local 
organizations’ 
ability to 
plan 
and 
implement 
their 
own 
development 
activities 
will 
improve 
the 
opportunities 
for 
social development after 
the 
projects 
itself 
ends. 
The 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
support 
decentralization 
and strengthen 
civil 
society’s 
ability 
to 
both provide 
and 
contract 
crucial 
development 
support  services. 
NGOs, 
private 
firms, 
universities 
and  other 
civil 
society 
organizations 
will 
participate 
in 
the 
project 
as 
beneficiaries 
(of 
training) 
and, 
more importantly, 
as 
providers 
of 
services 
to 
local-level 
beneficiary 
groups. 
Eligible 
organizations 
will 
be 
enrolled 
in 
a 
Registry 
of 
Qualified 
Service 
Providers, after 
which 
they 
can 
be 
contracted 
by 
local 
beneficiary 
groups 
to 
provide technical 
and 
institutional 
support services 
(see 
Annex 
2). 
6.5 
How 
will 
the 
project 
monitor 
performance 
in 
terms 
of 
social 
development outcomes? 
The 
project 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
system 
will 
measure 
impacts 
on 
people 
(e.g., 
level 
of 
satisfaction 
with 
project 
processes 
and 
outcomes, 
level 
of 
women’s 
participation 
within 
beneficiary 
organizations) 
and 
on 
institutional 
performance 
(e.g., 
gauging  improvements 
in 
a producer  organization’s 
ability  to 
effectively 
market 
its 
products 
or 
in 
a 
community 
pro-development  committee’s 
ability 
to 
prepare 
subproject  proposals). 
Grant-financed 
subproject  proposals 
will 
contain 
social 
and 
economic  baseline 
information 
which 
will 
be 
transferred 
into 
the 
management 
information 
system 
for 
periodic 
tracking 
and 
monitoring, 
and 
each 
subproject 
will 
include 
a 
monitoring plan 
with 
a 
set 
of 
indicators 
(including 
indicators 
to 
measure 
social 
impacts, 
some 
which 
will 
be defined 
by 
beneficiaries). 
Direct 
beneficiaries 
of 
subprojects 
and 
residents 
of 
communities 
bordering 
protected 
areas 
will 
participate 
in 
carrying 
out 
some 
aspects 
of 
the 
monitoring 
and 
analysis, 
and 
impacts 
on 
indirect 
beneficiaries 
will 
also 
be 
monitored. 
In 
addition, 
Project 
Operations 
Plans 
(POAs) 
will 
be 
prepared 
by 
the 
PCU 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
Technical 
Advisory 
Group 
for  submission and 
no 
objection 
to 
the 
Bank. 
Bi-annual 
Progress 
Reports 
will 
be 
prepared and 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
advance 
of 
Bank 
supervision 
missions and 
will 
be combined 
into 
a 
single 
Annual 
Progress 
Report. 
A 
Mid-term 
Review 
(MTR) 
and 
Implementation Completion 
Report (ICR) 
will 
be 
carried 
out, 
at 
which 
time 
stakeholder 
workshops 
will 
be 
held 
to 
share 
and 
review 
project 
progress and outcomes/impacts, 
including 
social 
outcomes. 
Where 
necessary, 
modifications 
based 
on monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
recommendations 
will 
be 
made 
to 
the 
Project Operational 
Manual. 
The 
PCU 
will 
prepare 
all 
project 
reports and 
the 
Executive 
Steering 
Committee 
will 
review, 
comment  and 
sign 
off 
on 
these 
reports and 
monitoring 
results. 
A 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
Coordinator 
will 
be 
placed 
within 
the 
PCU 
and 
given 
adequate 
logistical 
support 
to 
allow 
him/her 
to 
carry out 
these 
data 
gathering 
and 
evaluation functions.

(prepared 
by

are 
reflected 
in 
the

prohibit 
project 
financing 
from 
encouraging 
further 
incursions 
into 
and 
conversion 
of 
natural 
habitats, 
including 
forests, 
upland 
meadows 
and 
dry 
forests  and 
wetlands. 
Checklists 
and 
screening  mechanisms 
governing 
the 
selection 
of 
demand-driven 
local 
subprojects 
will 
filter 
out 
any proposals 
which 
could 
be 
harmful 
to 
such 
natural 
habitats. 
On 
the 
contrary,  community-managed 
forests 
and 
private 
conservation 
efforts 
will 
be 
encouraged 
and 
supported, 
financially 
and 
with 
expert 
technical 
assistance 
and 
information. 
Information 
on 
all 
the 
relict 
natural 
habitats 
within 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
will 
be 
generated, 
stored 
within 
the 
monitoring 
data 
base 
(GIS) 
and 
divulged 
through 
the 
environmental 
information 
and 
public 
education 
programs 
(in 
indigenous 
languages 
wherever possible). 
Forestry 
(OP 
4.36). 
The 
project 
will: 
(i) 
support 
community-based  forest 
management processes 
and 
practices 
which 
would 
retain 
as 
much 
natural 
forest 
as 
possible 
in 
areas 
where 
such forests 
still 
exist 
and 
are 
viable; 
(ii) 
improve 
the 
environmental 
aspects 
and reduce waste and unsustainable 
practices 
of 
current 
forest 
use 
and 
management practices, 
seeking 
to 
diversify 
current 
forest 
use 
patterns 
into 
more 
sustainable 
non-timberhon-consumptive 
uses 
including 
development 
of 
environmental 
services  markets; 
(iii) 
Page  34
Page 
30 
stimulate 
the 
revegetation 
of 
degraded lands and watersheds 
with 
natural 
and 
planted 
forests, 
wherever 
conditions 
allow for 
this 
to 
occur 
in 
a sustainable and 
efficient 
manner; 
(iv) 
contribute 
to 
the 
monitoring 
of 
existing 
forest 
cover 
within 
the 
project 
area 
(baseline) 
and 
changes 
in 
this 
cover, 
assisting 
MAGA, 
CONAP 
and 
INAB 
to 
address 
any incentives 
and 
identifiable 
causes 
which 
lead 
to 
forest 
conversion 
and 
degradation; 
(v) 
work 
with 
municipal 
governments  and 
communities 
in 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
existing 
and 
encouraging 
expansion 
of 
forests, 
wherever 
such expansion 
is 
viable 
and 
sustainable 
(e.g., 
for 
the 
generation 
of 
chargeable 
environmental 
services); 
and 
(vi) 
protect 
samples 
of 
rare 
and 
threatened 
forest  types 
within 
protected 
areas 
and 
parks 
and 
in 
general 
address 
all 
manner 
of 
threats 
to 
existing 
forests 
(fire, 
poor 
grazing 
practices,  unsustainable 
extraction 
of 
forest 
materials) 
through 
improved 
management 
capacity 
building 
at 
the 
regional 
(INAB), 
municipal 
and 
community 
levels. 
Regarding extraction 
of 
forest-based 
products 
(including 
timber, 
stakes, 
firewood, 
forest 
litter 
used 
as 
farm 
fertilizer, 
medicinal 
plants, 
etc.), 
the 
project 
will 
promote 
sustainable 
practices 
through 
financing 
community 
forest 
management plans, 
provide 
communities 
with 
forestry 
specialized 
technical 
assistance, 
and 
support 
traditional 
management approaches 
which 
have 
shown 
to 
retain viable 
forest 
stands 
while 
allowing 
for 
low-intensity 
use 
of 
the 
forests. 
During 
preparation,  exhaustive 
analysis and consultations 
were 
carried out 
on 
national 
policy 
and 
legal 
frameworks; forest 
land 
tenure 
and 
conflicts; 
cultural, 
social, 
environmental 
and 
economic  values 
of 
forests 
in 
the 
project 
area; 
and 
institutional 
capacity  around 
forests. 
Pest 
Management 
(OP 
4.09): 
The 
project 
does 
trigger 
this 
Bank 
OP, 
in 
that 
almost 
all 
commercial 
farmers 
and 
gardeners 
in 
the 
project 
area 
use 
chemical 
inputs, 
such 
as 
chemical fertilizers, 
pesticides 
and 
herbicides. 
The 
use 
of 
chemical 
inputs 
in 
traditional 
corn, 
beans 
and 
squash 
crops 
(milpa) 
and 
in 
production 
for 
home consumption 
is 
negligible; 
rather, 
traditional 
organic 
inputs 
such 
as 
those 
obtained 
from 
the 
forest 
floor, 
are 
preferred. 
The 
incidence 
of 
malpractice 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
application 
of 
chemical 
inputs 
is 
high. 
The 
project’s 
aim 
will 
be 
to 
raise 
agricultural 
productivity 
within 
the 
project 
area 
while 
also 
substituting 
for 
natural 
resources-degrading 
practices 
and 
reversing 
their 
effects 
(erosion, 
contamination, 
mining 
of 
fertility, 
and replacement 
of 
forest 
with 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
production). 
This 
process 
will 
take 
time, 
as 
well 
as 
require 
investments 
in 
public 
environmental 
education. 
Community 
subprojects 
with 
be 
screened 
for 
environmental 
compliance 
and 
farmers 
trained 
in 
appropriate 
applications 
of 
chemicals 
as 
needed. 
Thus, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
an 
overall 
reduction 
in 
the 
volume 
and 
toxicity 
of 
the 
chemical 
inputs, 
and do 
so 
gradually 
by 
substituting 
toxic 
substances 
for 
less 
toxic 
ones, 
large 
and 
inappropriate  applications 
for 
more 
appropriate 
quantities, 
and  generally 
promote 
sustainable practices 
(e.g., 
integrated 
pest 
management) 
over 
those  deemed 
environmentally 
unsustainable. 
In 
addition, 
no 
procurement 
of 
agrochemicals 
within 
the 
WHO 
Class 
1 
or 
2 
list 
would 
be 
allowed 
and, 
where agrochemical 
usage 
is 
an 
issue, 
all 
relevant 
subprojects 
will 
be 
required 
to 
include 
such 
elements 
as 
soils 
testing 
to 
reduce 
over-fertilization, 
training 
on 
appropriate 
use 
and 
storage 
and 
disposal 
of 
agrochemicals  and containers, 
cleaning 
of 
equipment 
and personal precautions 
to 
be 
taken. 
Strong 
gains 
will 
be made 
in 
these 
objectives 
through 
the 
environmental 
education  and 
information 
programs, 
the 
local-level 
extension 
and 
advisory 
services. 
Cultural 
Property 
(OPN 
11.03  and 
draft OP 
4.11). 
During 
preparation, 
the 
project 
contributed 
to 
financing  a 
series 
of 
workshops 
in 
the 
project 
area 
on 
indigenous (Mayan) 
natural 
resources 
planning 
and 
management practices. 
The 
results 
of 
these 
workshops, 
the 
Social 
Assessment and 
the 
close 
participation 
of 
the 
indigenous 
Plan 
de 
Accidn 
Forestal 
Maya 
(PAF-Maya) 
in 
the 
project preparation 
process, 
have 
been 
drawn 
into 
the 
project 
design 
and 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
delivery 
and 
management structure, 
through 
which 
decisions and proposals 
are 
generated 
and decided 
upon 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
with 
the 
full 
participation 
of 
local village 
and 
community 
authorities  and 
representatives, 
including 
the 
women. 
(See 
Annex 
11).

Indigenous 
Peoples 
(OD 
4.20): 
Some 
90-95% 
of 
rural 
people 
in 
the 
project 
area 
belong 
to 
Mayan 
indigenous ethnic 
groups. 
As 
such, 
the 
project 
should 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
and 
Participation 
Plan 
(IPDP), 
and 
has 
been 
designed 
as 
per 
the 
Bank’s 
definitions 
and 
policies 
set 
out 
in 
OD 
4.20. 
In 
addition, 
based 
upon 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
and 
its 
recommendations, 
and 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.30, 
a stand-alone 
IPDP 
has 
been 
prepared 
(Annex 
11). 
Most 
important 
for 
the 
project 
design 
is 
the 
commitment 
for 
the 
project 
to work 
within 
traditional 
Mayan 
cultural 
and 
natural 
resources and 
land 
use 
practices 
to 
achieve 
improvements 
in 
income 
and 
in 
natural 
resource 
conservation. 
A 
copy 
of 
the 
IPDP 
(in 
Spanish) 
has 
been 
placed 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
InfoShop. 
Involuntary 
Resettlement 
(OD 
4.30 
and 
draft 
OP 
4.12): 
The 
project 
would 
not 
support 
any 
involuntary 
relocation 
of 
people 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.30 and 
the 
Draft 
OP 
4.12 
paragraph 
2A. 
Nevertheless, 
a 
Process 
Framework 
has 
been 
prepared 
which 
summarizes 
current 
GoG 
legal 
provisions 
and 
instruments 
regarding 
rights 
of 
populations 
in 
and around 
protected 
areas. 
The 
Process 
Framework 
also 
provides 
guidelines 
and 
outlines 
means 
(such 
as 
extra 
assistance 
in 
preparation 
of 
proposals 
and 
access 
to 
subproject 
funds) 
for 
addressing 
potentially 
adverse 
economic  impacts that 
might 
result 
from 
project- 
supported 
implementation 
of 
existing 
and 
new, 
collaboratively 
designed 
management 
plans 
that 
include 
restriction 
of 
access 
to 
national 
protected 
areas 
and 
natural 
resources 
protected under other 
local 
regimes, 
A 
copy 
of 
the 
Process 
Framework 
document 
(in 
Spanish) 
is 
in 
the Project 
files 
and 
available through 
the 
Bank’s 
InfoShop. 
F. 
Sustainability 
and 
Risks 
1. 
Sustainability 
Incentives 
for 
stakeholders 
to 
implement 
the 
project 
are 
considered 
to 
be 
the 
most 
important 
investment 
in 
the 
sustainability 
of 
project 
outcomes. 
The 
project 
will 
establish partnerships 
with 
stakeholders 
(e.g., 
communities,  indigenous 
groups, 
the 
private 
sector, 
local municipal 
governments, 
and 
NGOs) 
for local 
planning, 
subproject 
identification, 
selection  and 
implementation. 
These 
groups 
will 
benefit 
from 
investments 
under  the 
project through  capacity-building 
and 
training, 
helping 
to 
ensure 
that  project 
objectives 
are 
owned 
locally 
and 
nationally, 
with 
the 
capacity 
in 
place 
to 
replicate 
the 
successful 
experiences 
and 
processes 
elsewhere 
in 
the 
region 
and 
country. 
The 
project 
would 
model 
decentralized, 
demand-driven development 
processes 
and 
private 
sector 
services 
delivery 
in 
agriculture, 
forestry 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation, 
thus 
making 
up 
for 
the 
near 
total 
absence 
of 
any 
such 
public 
services 
in 
these 
sectors. 
The 
degree 
to 
which 
these processes 
are 
successful 
and take 
hold 
among 
the 
beneficiaries 
will 
be 
a measure 
of 
project 
success 
and sustainability. 
The 
project 
will 
improve 
the 
ability 
of 
national 
and 
local 
agencies 
@e., 
MAGA, 
MARN, 
CONAP, 
INAB, 
NGOs 
and 
private 
groups) 
to 
integrate 
natural 
resources 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
values 
into 
development 
planning 
at 
all 
levels. 
The 
project 
will 
furnish 
and 
make 
available 
to 
local 
governments and 
communities 
planning information 
(e.g., 
GIs) 
previously 
held 
in 
tight 
control 
by 
centralized 
agencies 
in 
the 
capital.  Decentralized 
regional 
MAGA, 
MAW, 
CONAP, 
and 
INAB 
personnel 
will 
have 
been 
exposed 
to 
participatory 
resources  management 
approaches 
and, 
together 
with 
the 
private  technical 
service providers, 
will 
be 
better placed 
to 
contribute technical 
services 
to 
the 
rural 
populations 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
The 
project’s 
gender focus 
(during 
preparation, grant resources 
to 
support 
MAGA 
in 
articulating 
a gender 
policy 
were 
secured) 
and 
diffusion 
of 
culturally 
appropriate 
information 
should 
make 
a  permanent 
contribution 
to 
the 
capacity 
of 
rural 
women 
and  indigenous  people 
to 
gain 
greater 
acceptance 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
regional 
economy and 
the 
care 
and 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources.

The 
project 
will 
help 
ensure 
financial 
sustainability 
beyond 
the 
project 
period 
by 
developing 
cost 
recovery 
and 
financing 
mechanisms 
to 
recoup 
the 
management costs 
of 
protected 
areas 
(through tourism, 
concessions 
and 
user 
fees) 
and capture payments 
for 
conservation 
of 
environmental capital 
and services. 
In 
addition, 
it 
will 
develop 
the 
institutional 
capacity, 
methodologies 
and 
instruments 
for 
accessing 
other 
demand-driven 
rural 
development 
funding 
sources 
(e.g., 
FIS, 
FONAPAZ, 
FSDC) 
to 
finance 
local 
productive 
and 
natural 
resource management 
needs. 
The 
most 
durable 
investments 
are 
represented 
by 
the 
improved production 
and 
resource 
conservation 
practices 
it 
will 
foster, 
test 
and mainstream, 
combined 
with 
the 
institutional 
structures 
to 
carry 
them 
on 
into 
the 
future. 
Government support 
beyond 
the 
project 
phase 
is 
nominally 
assured 
by 
the 
current 
decentralizing 
natural 
resource 
and 
rural 
development and agrarian 
policies. 
The 
project 
builds 
on 
these 
concepts 
and 
will 
test 
implementing 
mechanisms 
for 
their 
application. 
It 
is 
hoped that 
these 
will 
be 
successful 
and 
can become a 
model 
for 
continued 
practice 
in 
the 
future.

Minimization 
Measures 
The 
project 
operates 
within 
the 
ongoing 
GoG 
decentralization 
agenda, 
associating 
processes 
with 
legally 
mandated 
local 
development committees 
and 
expressed 
sectoral 
policies. Significant 
promotion, 
participation, 
communications, 
and 
transparency- 
related activities 
are 
included 
in 
the 
design. 
Continuous 
dialogue 
with GoG 
during 
project 
implementation. 
Government 
has 
committed 
to provide 
significant 
resources, 
to 
be 
retroactively 
financed, 
to 
allow 
project 
start 
up 
to 
be 
advanced 
by 
six 
months 
in 
order 
to gain 
momentum. 
Project 
designed 
to 
take 
a phased 
approach. 
Design 
capitalized 
to 
the 
extent 
possible 
on 
previous 
experiences 
in

selection 
process 
includes 
local 
institutional 
capacity 
considerations. 
Capacity 
building 
activities 
will 
be tailored 
to local 
needs 
and capabilities. 
The 
project 
will 
develop 
consensus 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
valuing 
environmental 
services 
and 
on 
the 
design 
of 
mechanisms 
and 
institutional 
arrangements 
for doing 
so 
as 
well 
as 
on 
pilot 
mechanisms 
to 
test 
these. 
The 
project 
will 
support 
the 
SIGAP 
in 
the 
design 
of 
management 
plans that 
include social 
considerations 
and 
options 
to 
improve financial 
sustainability.

Possible 
controversial 
aspects 
The 
project 
is 
consistent 
with 
Government 
policy 
for 
the 
sector 
and 
the 
region, 
has 
its 
full 
support, 
and 
has 
been 
widely 
agreed 
to 
by 
local 
community, 
municipal 
and other 
civil 
society 
representatives. 
The 
main 
contentious  element  concerns indigenous 
communal 
land 
rights, 
resource 
access 
and 
uses 
(e.g., 
communal 
and 
municipal 
forests), 
given 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
GoG policy 
on 
communal 
lands 
to 
give 
full 
legal recognition 
to 
community-held 
land 
rights 
and 
titles. 
The 
project 
will 
address 
land 
tenure 
issues 
through 
facilitating 
linkages 
and 
cooperation 
with 
other 
public 
programs and investments 
such 
as 
the 
Bank-financed 
Land 
Fund 
and Cadastre 
projects 
and 
the 
GoG 
agency 
CONTIERRA. 
The 
project 
will 
seek 
to 
support and respect 
local 
and 
traditional land 
use 
systems. 
It 
will 
also 
make 
resources 
available 
to 
communities 
to 
engage 
legal 
and 
other technical 
counsel 
in 
regards 
to 
such 
elements, 
where 
it 
is 
judged 
to 
be 
helpful 
and appropriate. 
This 
will 
occur 
within 
the 
context 
of 
demand-driven 
subprojects. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Municipal 
Sustainable 
Development 
Agendas, 
inventories 
of 
land 
and resource 
access 
conflicts 
will 
be 
carried 
out 
and 
wherever 
demand 
exists, 
access 
will 
be 
facilitated 
to 
both 
informal 
and 
formal 
(e.g., 
with 
CONTIERRA, 
through 
a 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding) 
conflict 
resolution 
mechanisms. 
Synergies 
will 
be 
sought 
with 
the 
World 
Bank-financed 
Land 
Fund 
project, 
also 
implemented 
through 
MAGA, 
which 
has 
developed 
capacity 
to 
work 
in 
resolution 
of 
land 
tenure 
conflicts.

Description 
Component

Sustainable 
Livelihoods Component 
(US$40.6 
m. 
or 
73% 
of 
total project 
cost) 
The 
component 
will 
primarily 
finance 
community-driven 
investments 
in 
sustainable 
production, natural 
resource  management,  and conservation.  Secondarily, 
the 
component 
will 
strengthen 
the 
institutional

of 
municipalities, 
community 
associations, 
producer 
and resource management associations 
to 
plan 
and 
manage 
development activities. 
Subcomponent 
la: 
Subproject 
Grants 
The 
subcomponent 
will 
finance 
subproject  grants 
to 
community 
associations 
to 
increase 
productivity, 
stimulate 
innovation 
and 
generate 
employment, 
thereby 
increasing 
rural 
incomes and 
improving 
natural 
resource management. Subprojects 
will 
be 
financed 
across 
three categories: 
Sustainable 
Production, 
such 
as 
(i) 
improvement 
of 
production 
systems 
which 
require 
substantial 
use 
of 
inputs 
and technology 
(e.g., 
greenhouses); 
(ii) 
production 
for 
export 
or  high-value 
domestic 
markets 
(e.g., 
vegetables, 
cardamom, 
shade 
coffee); 
(iii) 
value-added 
processing 
of 
local 
products; 
(iv) 
improvements 
and 
development 
of 
small-scale 
artesenal 
and 
cottage 
industries 
or 
microenterprises 
to 
increase 
off-farm 
employment; and 
(v) 
small-scale and 
community 
reforestation; 
Natural 
Resource 
Management, 
for 
example 
(i) 
improved 
resource  management 
of 
traditional 
cropping 
and  grazing 
systems 
and 
community 
and 
municipal 
forests  and 
environmental 
services 
within 
existing 
traditional, 
multiple-use 
systems; 
(ii) 
other 
activities 
to 
reduce 
extractive 
pressures 
on 
protected 
areas; 
and 
(iii) 
environmental 
management 
of 
public 
goods 
(e.g., 
land 
and  soils 
rehabilitation, stabilization 
of 
heavily 
eroded 
or 
slumping 
slopes, 
and 
non-commercial reforestation 
or 
revegetation 
on 
heavily 
degraded 
lands; 
and 
Conservation, 
including: 
(i) 
creation 
and/or 
improvement 
of 
protected 
areas 
managed 
by 
communities, 
municipalities 
or 
local 
NGOs; 
(ii) 
improved 
management 
of 
community 
forests, 
aquifer 
recharge 
zones 
and potable water 
sources; 
(iii) 
natural 
disaster 
mitigation 
activities; 
(iv) 
recreational 
and ecotourism 
areas; 
and 
(v) 
the 
protection 
of 
sacred 
natural 
sites 
(jicham 
witz 
). 
Sub 
project 
Cycle: 
Community 
Associations  determine 
their 
local 
priorities, 
develop subproject proposals and 
submit 
them 
to 
the 
Instancias 
Locales; 
Instancias 
Locales, 
in 
regularly 
scheduled 
public 
meetings, 
review, 
prioritize 
and 
approve 
subprojects 
within 
a 
pre-determined 
resource envelope; 
PCU 
(through 
a 
registry 
of 
qualified 
private 
service 
providers) 
technically 
evaluates 
approved 
subprojects 
and 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
subproject 
proponent 
to 
administer 
the 
subproject 
grant  and 
confirms 
compliance 
with 
operational 
guidelines 
before 
releasing 
funds; 
Subproject 
grant 
agreements are 
signed 
between the 
PCU 
and 
the 
community 
association, 
detailing 
the 
terms 
for 
financing, 
execution, ownership, 
operation 
and maintenance 
of 
the 
subproject; 
Funds 
for 
subproject 
implementation 
are 
transferred 
directly 
to 
the 
bank 
account 
of 
the 
community 
association;

Community 
associations 
are 
responsible 
for 
contracting 
goods, 
works 
and 
technical 
assistance 
for 
subproject execution,  bear 
responsibility 
for

may 
request 
technical 
assistance 
to 
develop  administrative 
capacity,  and 
operation  and

programs and

Grant 
financing 
ceilings 
have been established 
for 
each 
municipality, 
based 
on 
a 
per capita 
distribution 
scheme. 
Total 
financing 
available 
to 
a 
given 
municipality 
is 
roughly 
equivalent 
to 
one 
annual 
per 
capita 
allocation 
(based 
on 
10% 
of 
general revenues) 
of 
funds 
made 
to 
that 
municipality 
by 
the GoG. The 
ceilings 
represent 
the 
maximum 
indicative 
amount 
which 
the 
municipality 
can 
receive 
from 
the 
project. 
Municipal 
allocation 
ceilings 
will 
be 
reviewed 
and adjusted annually, 
in 
light 
of 
total 
grant 
financing 
still 
uncommitted 
from 
the 
previous project 
year. 
Eligibility 
and 
financing criteria 
for 
community 
subprojects 
would 
be 
detailed 
in 
the Project Operational 
Manual. 
Regional 
Subprojects: 
As 
a 
result 
of 
interchanges 
between 
Instuncius 
Locales 
it 
is 
expected 
that 
some 
regional 
proposals 
(from 
so-called 
“muncomunidudes”) 
for 
cross-cutting 
subprojects 
of 
strategic 
importance 
for 
the 
sustainable development 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
will 
be 
developed, 
These 
might 
include: 
applied 
research, 
market 
studies 
and 
marketing; 
special 
training or information 
programs; 
and 
strategic 
alliances 
to 
strengthen 
local 
institutions 
(e.g., 
alliances between 
local 
and 
international 
potato, 
fruit, 
or 
livestock 
research programs;  alliances 
between 
local 
and 
national 
farmers’  organizations; 
local 
exporters and 
international 
trade 
promotion 
groups). 
The 
ceilings 
for 
these 
would 
initially 
be 
raised 
to 
$250,000 
and 
would 
require 
approval 
by 
the 
Executive 
Steering Committee, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
no-objection 
from 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Funds 
for 
these 
would 
be 
proportionally 
discounted 
from 
each 
participating 
municipalities 
funding 
allocation. 
Subproject  grants 
will 
finance: 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
services, 
studies, 
limited 
goods 
and 
equipment, 
small 
works 
and infrastructure, and 
limited 
fixed 
and 
working 
capital 
investments. 
GEF 
funds 
will 
primarily 
finance 
the 
Conservation 
Subprojects and 
incremental 
costs 
for 
biodiversity 
conservation 
within 
the 
sustainable 
production 
and 
natural 
resource  management  subprojects. 
Recurrent 
costs, 
particularly 
for 
agricultural 
inputs, 
will 
not 
be 
financed after 
the 
first 
production 
cycle. 
Training 
and  Technical 
Assistance: 
The 
PCU 
will 
contract 
the 
design 
of 
modules 
for 
training 
in 
Project/Program Orientation, 
Participatory Planning 
and 
Project/Program 
Implementation, Participatory 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation, 
Biodiversity 
and 
Environmental 
Conservation, 
Local 
Organization 
Development, 
Marketing, 
and 
Non-Farm 
Employment. 
The 
target 
audiences 
for 
these 
modules 
would 
be: 
(i) 
municipal-level 
promoters, 
(ii) 
Instuncia 
Local 
leaders, 
(iii) 
municipal 
government 
staff 
and 
(iv) 
community 
association leaders and 
members. 
Subproject-specific 
technical 
training 
will 
be 
financed 
as 
a 
part 
of 
subprojects 
in 
response 
to 
client 
demand. 
In 
addition, 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
training 
scholarships 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
increase 
the 
expertise 
of 
indigenous and female professionals 
in 
rural 
development 
and 
natural 
resources conservation. 
The 
PCU 
will 
also 
contract 
local 
and/or 
international 
experts 
to 
provide 
short-term 
technical 
assistance 
in 
response 
to 
client 
requests 
and 
project 
needs 
on 
specific 
issues 
(e.g., 
technical 
review 
of 
subproject 
proposals 
where 
expertise 
is 
not 
available 
within 
the 
Registry 
of 
Service Providers, diagnosis 
of 
crop 
diseases, 
legal 
assistance 
in 
preparing 
contract 
documents, 
design 
of 
an 
irrigation 
system, 
design 
of 
packaging materials 
for 
export 
products, 
clarification 
of 
legal land 
and 
resource 
rights, 
etc). 
Subproject 
Targeting: 
Fifty-four 
(54) 
municipalities 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
(out 
of 
a 
total 
of 
132 
in 
the 
region) 
would 
be 
prioritized 
under 
the 
project. Eighteen 
municipalities 
would 
participate 
in 
year 
one, 
an 
additional 
18 
in 
the 
second year 
and 
the 
remaining 
18 
would 
be 
added 
in 
the 
third 
year. 
Twenty-two 
municipalities, 
representing 
the 
highest 
importance 
for 
biodiversity 
would 
be 
favored 
for 
the 
GEF- 
financed 
subprojects 
(see 
project  files 
for 
details). 
Prioritization 
of 
these 
municipalities 
within 
the 
Page  44
Page 
40 
Western 
Altiplano 
is 
based 
on: 
(i) 
GoG’s 
Poverty Reduction 
Strategy; 
(ii) 
total 
forest 
area 
and 
percent 
of 
watershed 
under 
forest  cover; 
(iii) 
habitat 
or 
ecosystems 
critical 
for biodiversity 
conservation  and 
(iv) 
absence 
of 
other 
large 
public 
or donor-financed projects 
with 
similar 
objectives. 
Ultimately, 
eleven 
(1 
1) 
upper 
watersheds 
were 
prioritized 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
for 
project 
intervention, 
resulting 
in 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
40 
municipalities 
with 
significant 
land 
areas 
in 
those watersheds. 
Subsequently, 
these 
were 
compared 
against 
GoG’s 
poverty  reduction 
priorities 
(as 
identified 
in 
the 
National 
Poverty 
Reduction 
Strategy)  and 
an 
additional 
14 
municipalities, 
mostly 
contiguous 
to 
the 
initial 
40, 
were 
included 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
project 
support 
for 
poverty reduction 
objectives 
(see 
Table 
1). 
Subcomponent 
1 
b: 
Local Institutional 
Strengthening 
This 
subcomponent 
will 
provide 
grant  resources 
to 
participating 
municipalities 
to 
finance 
specialized 
technical 
assistance, 
training 
and  other  services 
as 
needed. 
The 
PCU 
will 
maintain 
a 
roster 
of 
pre- 
qualified 
service 
providers 
and 
facilitate 
the 
contracting 
of 
these 
services. 
Municipal 
capacity 
assessments 
will 
be 
conducted 
for 
each 
municipality 
to 
ensure 
their 
ability to 
administer 
funding 
under 
the 
grants. 
The 
grants 
will 
be 
tranched 
based 
on 
successful 
completion 
of 
successive 
steps 
in 
the 
institutional 
capacity 
building 
program. 
Municipalities 
and 
local 
organizations 
will 
be 
expected 
to 
co-finance 
10% 
of 
total 
costs 
of 
activities 
financed 
under 
the 
municipal 
grants. 
These 
grants 
will 
be 
used 
to: 
(i) 
establish, 
or 
strengthen 
the 
Instancia 
Local 
in 
order 
to 
develop 
a 
Municipal 
Sustainable 
Development Agenda 
(Agenda 
de 
Desurrollo 
Sostenible), 
prioritize 
and select 
local 
subprojects; 
(ii) 
employ, 
train 
and 
equip 
a 
municipal 
promoter 
(Promotor 
Municipal) 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Instancia Local 
to 
support 
municipal 
development 
planning 
and 
subproject 
grant 
activities; 
(iii) 
promote 
identification 
of 
local 
conservation and 
productivity 
subproject 
proposals 
to 
submit 
for 
project 
or 
other 
financing; 
and 
(iv) 
strengthen 
local 
organizations, 
as 
required, 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
access 
subproject grant 
financing 
for 
participatory 
planning;  establishing 
or 
improving 
financial 
accounting, 
planning, 
and  management 
systems; 
multi-stakeholder  collaborative 
decision-making 
and 
problem 
solving; 
developing 
leadership 
skills; 
membership training, 
participatory 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation, 
gender 
inclusion, 
and 
cultural 
communications 
skills; 
cross-visits 
to 
learn 
from 
successful groups; and 
linkages 
with 
other organizations and 
programs; 
(v) 
improve 
the 
design 
of 
conservation  and 
productive 
subproject  proposals; 
(vi) 
supervise 
on-going 
subproject 
implementation; 
and 
(vii) 
hold 
regular 
discussion 
forums 
on 
conservation and development 
issues, 
plans, 
and 
innovations. 
Municipal 
grants 
would 
also 
provide 
support 
to 
the 
Instancias Locales 
to: 
(i) 
interact 
with 
the 
groups 
they 
represent 
and 
with 
other 
Instancias Locales 
to 
identify 
and 
prioritize 
the 
broader 
types 
of 
assistance 
required 
to 
create 
opportunities 
to 
achieve economies 
of 
scale 
for 
key 
services 
(e.g., 
commercialization 
and marketing,  economic diversification,  development 
of 
local 
savings and 
credit 
mechanisms, 
etc.); 
(ii) 
seek 
financing 
from 
other 
sources 
to 
meet 
priorities 
not 
financed through 
this 
program; 
and 
(iii) 
support 
occasional  departmental 
or 
region-wide 
forums 
for 
interchange 
between 
local 
producer 
groups, 
state 
agencies, 
and 
other 
similar ongoing 
programs 
Additionally, staff 
of 
regional, 
departmental, 
and 
municipal 
MAGA, 
MARN 
and 
NAB 
offices 
will 
receive 
limited 
financing 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
their 
decentralized 
and deconcentrated support 
for 
local 
development 
through 
the 
project, 
such 
as 
training 
in 
environmental 
and  social 
aspects 
of 
natural 
resources  management, 
technical 
extension 
services, 
participatory 
planning, 
and 
monitoring 
and evaluation. 
Component 
2: 
Biodiversity 
Conservation 
(Total: 
$6.8 
m. 
or 
12% 
of 
total 
project 
cost) 
The 
component 
will 
strengthen 
local 
and 
national 
capacity to: 
(i) 
conserve 
natural 
habitats, 
especially 
those 
containing 
globally 
important  biodiversity; 
(ii) 
maintain 
locally 
and 
nationally 
important 
environmental 
services  and 
(iii) 
do 
so 
wherever  possible 
through 
support 
to 
local 
natural 
resources 
management, 
religious 
and 
cultural 
traditions 
which 
contribute 
to 
biodiversity 
conservation objectives. 
The 
component 
will 
finance: 
(i) 
protection 
of 
sites 
of 
global 
and 
local 
importance; 
(ii) 
intercultural 
communication 
and  education 
on 
environmental 
issues; 
and 
(iii) 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
of 
Page  45
Page 
41 
biodiversity 
conservation. 
Seven 
target 
areas 
were 
selected,  based 
on: 
the 
presence 
of 
important 
biodiversity; 
representation 
in 
the 
national 
protected 
areas 
system 
(SIGAP); 
contribution 
to 
strengthening 
the 
Mesoamerican 
Biological 
Corridor 
(MBC); 
presence 
of 
unique 
geomorphologic 
traits 
or 
cultural 
sites; 
watershed 
and 
environmental 
services; 
and 
synergies 
with 
other 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
(See 
Annex 
12 
and 
project 
files 
for 
more 
details). 
Protection 
of 
Sites 
of 
Global 
Importance: 
A 
set 
of 
inter-related activities, 
designed 
to 
strengthen 
local 
and 
national 
institutional 
capacity 
for 
conservation and 
co-management 
of 
natural 
resources 
in 
target 
areas, 
will 
include: 
Planning 
for 
Protected Areas: 
Within 
the 
seven 
areas 
targeted 
for 
improved 
protection, 
CONAP 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
PCU, 
in 
consultation 
with 
municipalities, 
Instancias  Locales, 
development 
and 
conservation programs 
in 
the 
region, 
community 
members  and other 
local 
stakeholders, 
will 
develop 
plans 
for 
co-management 
within 
the 
seven 
priority 
areas 
for 
conservation. 
Strengthening CONAP: 
CONAP 
will 
be 
strengthened 
in 
its 
role 
as 
a 
facilitator 
of 
develop 
and 
implement 
reforms 
designed 
to 
strengthen 
its 
program 
of 
biodiversity 
conservation 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
Specifically, 
its 
regional 
capacity 
to 
interact 
with 
civil 
society 
and 
facilitate 
local 
biodiversity 
conservation 
initiates 
would 
be 
strengthened 
as 
would 
the 
capacity 
of 
its 
central 
offices 
to 
support 
its 
decentralized 
staff 
in 
the 
project 
region. 
An 
institutional 
training 
program 
would 
be 
developed  and 
implemented 
for 
CONAP’s 
staff 
in 
key 
topics 
such 
as 
leadership, 
strategic 
planning, 
conflict 
management, 
intercultural 
communications, 
participatory 
processes, etc.. 
Regional technical 
staff 
would 
also  be 
trained 
in 
wildlife 
management 
and protection. 
The 
project 
would 
also 
finance 
an 
extensive 
review 
of 
biodiversity 
conservation 
experiences 
in 
the 
region, 
including 
extensive  consultations  and 
participatory 
analysis, 
leading 
to 
a  possible 
revamping 
of 
the 
SIGAP 
(concepts, 
protected 
areas 
categories, 
declaration 
processes) 
in 
light 
of 
traditional 
rights, 
territoriality 
and 
cosmovision 
of 
the 
Maya 
and 
their 
spiritual 
values 
which 
promote 
conservation. 
Expanding 
the 
SIGAP: 
CONAP, 
in 
coordination 
with 
Instancias Locales 
and 
municipal 
promoters, 
will 
provide 
communities 
with 
technical 
assistance 
for 
special 
studies, 
local training 
and workshops, 
multi- 
stakeholder 
participatory 
planning, 
and 
legal 
services 
required to 
establish 
new 
protected 
areas 
under a 
variety 
of 
management 
regimes 
(e.g., 
municipal 
regional 
parks, 
private 
reserves). 
These 
will 
only 
be 
established at 
the 
behest 
of 
the 
local 
communities 
and 
where 
doing 
so 
contributes 
to 
broader 
biodiversity 
conservation objectives. 
Strengthening 
Traditional 
Tenure 
Rights 
and 
Management 
Systems: 
CONAP 
will 
conduct 
special 
studies 
and 
provide 
targeted 
assistance 
as 
requested 
by 
communities 
to 
(i) 
Strengthen 
traditional 
tenure 
and 
management 
systems 
for 
natural 
resources 
(principally  community 
forests) 
and 
(ii) 
to 
resolve 
local 
conflicts 
over 
resource 
ownership. 
Biodiversity 
conservation 
promoters 
will 
identify 
candidate 
communities 
by 
consulting 
with 
local 
leaders  and 
institutions, 
RADEAS, 
Instancias  Locales, 
and 
municipal 
governments. 
Case 
studies 
of 
these 
interventions 
will 
provide 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
issues 
relating 
to 
traditional 
tenure 
rights 
and management 
systems 
for 
community 
forests and 
form 
the 
basis 
for 
modifications 
to 
the 
regulatory framework 
for 
rights 
and management 
of 
community 
resources. 
Special 
Studies: 
The 
PCU 
will 
contract 
qualified 
local 
or 
international 
organizations 
or 
individuals 
to 
complete 
studies 
on 
topics 
such 
as 
ecological 
evaluations 
of 
specific 
areas, 
flora 
and 
fauna inventories, 
hydrological 
studies, 
studies 
of 
tenure 
and 
management 
systems, 
or 
others.  These 
will 
be  closely 
coordinated 
with 
the 
Environmental 
Services 
studies 
(Component 
3) 
to avoid 
duplication 
of 
efforts. 
The 
project 
will 
publish 
the 
completed 
studies 
and 
make 
these 
available 
on 
a 
CONAP 
central 
database. 
The 
component 
will 
finance: 
technical 
assistance; 
travel 
and 
operating 
costs 
for 
CONAP 
promoters; 
costs 
of 
annual 
workshops 
for 
target protected 
areas; 
vehicles 
and equipment, 
training, 
and 
technical 
assistance 
for 
CONAP; 
special 
studies; 
and 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training for community 
activities; 
and 
small 
public 
works 
to 
improve 
protected 
areas’ 
infrastructure.

Strategy 
for 
Intercultural 
Environmental 
Education: 
An 
Environmental Education 
Strategy 
will 
be 
developed and 
implemented,  based 
on 
extensive consultations 
with 
institutions 
active 
in 
the 
project 
area 
and  other  stakeholders 
with 
relevant 
expertise. 
CONAP, 
assisted 
by 
the 
PCU, 
will 
contract 
local 
institutions 
to 
produce 
multilingual 
materials 
(on 
environmental 
issues 
relevant 
to 
the 
seven 
environmental protection 
target 
areas) 
for 
radio, 
video  and 
other 
communications 
media (including 
printed 
materials) 
in 
the 
nine 
principal 
languages 
of 
the 
region. 
A 
series 
of 
multilingual 
interactive 
community 
environmental 
programs, designed 
to 
stimulate 
awareness 
of 
environmental 
issues 
and 
draw 
on 
traditional 
knowledge, 
will 
also 
be 
integrated 
with 
the 
Formal Environmental 
Education 
initiatives 
under 
the 
overall 
strategy. 
The 
implementation 
services 
provider 
will 
collaborate 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Education 
to 
develop 
a 
multilingual 
training 
program 
on 
environmental 
education 
and 
pilot 
this 
in 
primary 
schools. 
The 
component 
will 
finance  technical 
assistance 
for 
development 
of 
multilingual 
environmental 
communications 
programs 
and 
mass 
media 
products; 
community 
environmental 
programs; 
costs 
of 
broadcasting, 
printing, 
and 
or performing 
environmental 
communications 
materials; 
training 
for 
teachers; 
and 
costs 
for 
schools 
to 
introduce environmental 
elements 
in 
the 
curricula. 
Biodiversity 
Conservation 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation: 
The 
component 
will 
strengthen 
CONAP’s 
biodiversity 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
capacity 
by 
establishing 
a 
comprehensive 
biodiversity 
information 
system 
for 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
CONAP 
will 
implement 
these 
activities 
and 
(i) 
upgrade 
its 
GIS 
with 
new 
equipment, 
computer 
programs,  and 
data; 
(ii) 
update  ecosystem maps 
for 
INAB; 
(iii) 
establish a 
central 
database 
on 
protected 
areas 
within 
the 
SIGAP 
and other 
areas 
of 
natural 
habitat 
under 
other 
types 
of 
protective 
and 
use 
regimes. 
This 
system 
will 
have linkages 
to 
Western 
Altiplano 
regional 
offices  and 
form 
part 
of 
a 
national 
system. 
The 
component 
will 
finance: 
equipment, 
training, 
travel 
expenses, 
and 
technical 
assistance 
for 
CONAP 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
an 
expanded 
biodiversity 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
program. 
Component 
3: 
Environmental 
Service 
Markets 
(US$2.3 
million 
or 
4% 
of 
total project 
cost) 
The 
objective 
of 
this 
component 
is 
to 
increase 
the 
provision 
of 
environmental 
services, 
which 
currently 
are 
not 
recognized 
in 
the 
market, 
by 
creating 
the 
conditions 
for 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
appropriate 
mechanisms 
to 
create markets, 
sell 
environmental 
services and establish 
payments 
to 
land 
managers 
for 
provision 
of 
these 
services. 
The 
Component 
will 
(i) 
develop 
the 
framework 
for 
policies 
and 
markets for 
environmental 
services, 
through 
the 
elaboration 
of 
a 
National 
Strategy 
for 
Environmental 
Services; 
(ii) 
provide local 
and 
foreign 
technical 
assistance 
for 
research 
and 
special 
studies 
and 
training 
for 
local 
and 
national 
officials 
working 
in 
areas 
related 
to 
development 
of 
environmental 
services 
policy, 
legal 
framework  and 
pilot 
programs; 
and 
(iii) 
design 
and 
implement 
pilot 
projects 
aimed 
at 
developing 
capacity, 
methodologies 
and 
instruments 
for 
market-based 
incentives 
for 
provision 
of 
environmental 
services. 
As 
there 
exists 
wide 
interest and several 
years 
of 
prior 
work 
by 
various 
institutional 
and 
bi- 
lateral 
actors 
on 
this 
emerging 
theme 
in 
Guatemala, 
MARN 
will 
seek 
to 
capitalize 
on 
this 
by 
forming 
a 
national-level coordination group 
to 
share 
and disseminate experiences 
and learning. 
The 
so-called 
Grupo 
Interinstitucional 
de 
Acompaiiamiento 
(GIA), 
which 
was 
loosely 
formed previously 
to 
provide 
a 
forum 
for 
coordination 
on 
environmental 
services 
in 
Guatemala 
can 
serve 
as 
“seed 
capital” 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
national-level 
group.

the 
World 
Bank 
will 
have 
been 
issued 
and 
put 
into 
effect. 
Among 
the 
required 
elements 
of 
a 
satisfactory 
Operational 
Manual 
will 
be: 
a 
first-year 
operating 
plan 
(POA) 
satisfactory 
to 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
terms 
of 
reference, acceptable 
to 
the 
World 
Bank, 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
an 
information 
campaign 
for 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
project; the establishment 
of 
the 
MIS; 
the 
project 
baseline 
study 
and 
the 
overall 
evaluation 
framework. 
The 
Project Operational 
Manual 
is 
the 
governing 
document 
which 
details 
the procedures 
to 
be 
followed 
in 
project implementation. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation: 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
supervising 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation 
work 
within 
each 
of 
the 
project 
component  activities, 
consolidating 
information 
for 
required project 
reporting 
and 
contracting 
special 
impact 
and 
evaluation 
studies. 
A 
Management 
Information 
System 
(MIS) 
maintained 
by 
the 
PCU 
will 
continuously 
register 
and update a 
series 
of 
key 
parameters 
regarding 
subproject implementation, 
community 
associations, 
instancias locales 
and 
ongoing 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
activities. 
Project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
systems 
would 
provide, 
inter 
alia, 
routine, 
detailed 
information 
on 
a 
series 
of 
indicators 
of 
indigenous 
peoples’ 
and 
women’s 
participation 
and 
benefit 
from 
project activities. 
If 
participation or 
benefit 
falls 
significantly below 
established 
targets, 
the 
Project 
Annual 
Reviews 
would 
recommend corrective 
actions. 
Local 
actors 
will 
participate 
in 
the 
design 
of 
indicators 
and 
in 
impact 
monitoring. 
The 
implementing 
agencies 
(MAGA, 
URN, 
CONAP, 
INAB) 
will 
establish 
a 
joint 
working 
group 
to 
ensure 
that relevant 
elements 
of 
the 
M&E 
system 
developed 
are 
incorporated 
into 
their 
agencies’ 
M&E 
system, 
thus 
contributing 
to 
the strengthening 
of 
these 
and 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
investments. 
During 
appraisal, 
the 
project 
team 
reviewed 
the 
key 
parameters. 
Terms 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
MIS 
are 
required 
in 
the 
Operational Manual; the Operational 
Manual 
is 
a 
condition 
of 
loan 
effectiveness. 
The 
project 
would 
implement evaluation 
studies 
to 
assess 
subproject 
impact 
and 
provide 
feedback 
to 
improve 
future 
project 
operations. 
These 
studies 
would 
include: 
(i) 
annual 
physical 
performance reviews 
to 
assess 
the 
quality 
and 
sustainability 
of 
common 
types 
of 
financed 
subprojects, 
including 
reviews 
of 
community-based 
procurement; 
(ii) 
an 
evaluation/implementation 
review, 
carried 
out 
at 
mid-term, 
to 
include  beneficiary 
consultations 
to 
evaluate 
project 
performance  and 
impact 
as 
perceived 
by 
its 
beneficiaries; 
and 
(iii) 
a 
rigorous 
and 
comprehensive 
impact 
evaluation. 
Specifically, 
the 
impact 
evaluation 
would 
assess 
(a) 
poverty 
targeting 
of 
beneficiaries 
relative 
to 
the 
income 
distribution 
of 
the 
Page  49
Page

population 
at  large; 
(b) 
household 
welfare; 
(c) 
social 
capital 
formation 
at 
the 
community 
level; 
(d) 
improved 
governance 
at 
the 
municipal 
level; 
and 
(e) 
ex-post 
cost-benefit 
of 
productive 
investments. 
Terms 
of 
Reference 
for 
the 
project 
baseline study  and

GUATEMALA 
WESTERN ALTIPLANO NATURAL 
RESOURCES 
MANAGEMENT 
PROJECT 
Economic Analysis 
A. 
Summary 
of 
benefits 
and 
costs: 
The 
Project 
aims 
to 
integrate 
activities 
for 
natural 
resources conservation,  sustainable 
productivity, 
and 
improved 
rural 
livelihoods 
to 
enhance 
value of 
the 
natural 
resource 
base 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
Benefits 
from 
the 
Project 
would 
include: 
0 
0 
Social  capital 
built 
in 
local 
organizations, 
decentralized  government 
units, 
and 
new 
institutional 
arrangements: 
This 
social capital 
is 
essential 
to 
future 
social 
and 
economic development 
of 
the 
area. 
Productivity 
increases 
from 
sustainable 
agricultural, 
forestry, 
off-farm, 
and 
tourism 
enterprises 
made 
possible 
by 
Project 
investments: 
These 
productivity 
increases 
and 
the 
sustainable 
employment 
generated 
by 
the Project 
are 
important 
parts 
of 
national 
strategy 
to 
reduce 
the 
high 
poverty 
levels 
of 
the 
area. 
Conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
biodiversity: 
Natural 
resources 
of 
the 
area 
provide 
both 
essential 
local 
environmental 
services 
and 
globally 
important biodiversity. 
Environmental 
services 
market 
and 
policy 
development 
would 
establish a basis 
for 
future 
supply 
of 
essential 
environmental 
services. 
Development 
and 
demonstration of 
a 
viable 
strategy 
and 
institutional 
arrangement 
for 
government 
financing 
of 
rural 
development: 
The 
mechanisms 
being 
developed 
by 
the 
Project 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
wider 
national 
investments 
in 
sustainable management 
and 
use 
of 
natural 
resources. 
Contribution 
to 
implementation 
of 
the 
Peace 
Accords, 
national integration 
and 
avoidance 
of 
future 
civil 
strife: 
Rural 
developments 
in 
the 
area 
are  a 
government 
commitment 
and 
are 
essential 
to 
overcoming 
the 
distrust 
and 
disruption 
of 
past 
civil 
war.

Clearly, 
few 
of 
these 
benefits 
lend 
themselves 
to 
estimation 
in 
quantitative 
terms, 
and 
fewer 
to 
evaluation 
in 
monetary 
terms. 
Furthermore, 
given 
the 
wide 
range 
and 
diverse 
nature 
of 
the 
benefits 
that 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
generated 
by 
the 
project,  aggregation 
into 
single 
measures 
of 
project 
worth 
is 
particularly 
problematic 
in 
methodological 
terms, 
with 
results 
difficult 
to 
interpret. 
Project 
costs 
involve 
the 
application 
of 
financial 
resources and 
contributions 
from 
project 
beneficiaries, 
largely 
in 
the 
form 
of 
own 
labor. 
The 
economic  and 
financial 
analysis 
illustrated 
in 
this 
annex  focuses 
on 
project  activities  that 
are 
amenable 
to 
reasonable 
estimation and 
aggregation 
of 
expected 
benefits: 
i.e., 
the 
sub-project 
grants 
in 
the 
productive 
and 
natural 
resource management categories, 
which 
amount 
to 
about 
50% 
of 
the 
entire 
project 
budget, 
and 
to 
about 
60% 
of 
World 
Bank 
financing. 
For 
other 
project 
activities, 
this 
annex 
provides 
a 
brief 
characterization 
of 
the 
costs 
and 
benefits, 
comparing 
them 
where 
feasible 
to 
suitable benchmarks 
in 
terms 
of 
effectiveness 
or 
cost 
norms. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Annex, 
the 
quantitative  analysis 
of 
costs 
and 
benefits 
for 
the 
entire 
project 
is 
summarized 
and related 
to 
those 
benefits 
that 
have 
not 
been 
measured. 
B. 
Economic and 
financial 
analysis: 
community 
subprojects 
Methodology 
Based 
on 
a 
number 
of 
studies, 
completed 
during 
project 
preparation, 
farm 
models 
were 
developed 
to 
evaluate 
the economic and 
financial 
viability 
of 
a 
group 
of 
different 
types 
of 
subprojects 
that 
may 
be 
Page  57
Page 
53 
submitted 
for 
financing, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
eligibility 
criteria 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
operational 
manual 
(CODERSA, 
2000 
b-g). 
The 
farm 
models 
provide 
information 
on 
costs 
and 
benefits under a 
“with” 
and 
“without” 
subproject 
scenario. 
The comparison 
of 
these 
two 
scenarios 
yields 
the 
profitability 
of 
each 
activity 
according 
to 
three 
different 
indicators: 
(i) 
cash 
flow 
effects 
on 
project 
beneficiaries, 
(ii) 
net 
private 
returns 
to 
project 
beneficiaries 
(including 
own 
labor 
costs); 
and 
(iii) 
net 
economic 
returns 
to 
the 
economy 
(including 
investment 
under 
the 
project). 
These 
figures 
are 
calculated 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
simple 
totals  over 
the 
five-year 
project 
horizon 
for 
each 
activity 
and 
also 
in 
terms 
of 
discounted 
net 
present 
values 
(NPV). 
In 
order 
to 
reflect 
the 
higher 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
capital 
faced 
by 
farmers, 
a 
private 
discount rate 
of 
15% 
is 
applied 
to 
cash 
flow 
and 
private 
returns 
and an 
economic 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
capital 
of 
10% 
is 
applied 
to 
the 
economic 
returns. 
Cash 
flow 
analysis 
determines 
whether 
adoption 
of 
new 
technologies 
financed 
by 
the 
subproject 
will 
increase 
or 
decrease cash 
flow 
to 
farmers. 
The 
analysis 
of 
private 
returns 
reproduces 
the decision faced 
by 
beneficiaries 
by 
modeling 
all 
costs 
and 
benefits that 
accrue 
to 
them, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
they 
reflect 
(i) 
cash transactions, 
(ii) 
changes 
in 
allocation 
of 
household 
resources, 
or 
(iii) 
the 
availability 
of 
subsistence 
production 
for 
own 
consumption. 
The 
net 
economic 
returns 
portray 
the net benefits 
as 
they 
accrue 
to 
the 
Guatemalan economy 
and 
serve 
as 
a 
useful 
indicator 
of 
the 
utility 
of 
the 
subprojects 
to 
the 
overall 
economy, 
ignoring 
any 
distributional 
effects. 
In 
addition, 
information 
on 
the 
contribution 
to 
total 
economic 
costs 
under 
the 
project 
can 
be 
extracted 
from 
the 
models. 
In 
other words, 
the 
costs 
that 
are 
included 
in 
the 
analyses 
consist 
of: 
0 
0 
0 
cash 
flow 
costs 
for 
purchased 
inputs 
and labor 
made 
by 
beneficiaries; 
own 
labor 
invested 
by 
beneficiaries; 
and 
project 
investments 
in 
fixed 
and 
variable 
costs 
of 
developing 
the 
subprojects. 
The 
benefits  consist 
largely 
of 
cash-flow 
benefits 
from 
the 
sale 
of 
products. 
In 
a 
number 
of 
cases, 
the 
“without” 
subproject scenario consists 
of 
subsistence 
production 
and, 
thus, 
the 
benefits 
are 
not 
considered 
as 
cash 
flow 
benefits 
but 
rather 
as 
part 
of 
the 
private 
and economic 
returns. 
In 
addition, 
the 
provision 
of 
family 
water 
tanks 
implies 
a 
benefit 
that 
is 
derived 
from 
the 
savings 
in 
labor that 
would 
otherwise 
be 
spent 
collecting 
water. 
This 
benefit 
also 
accrues 
only 
as 
a 
private 
and economic 
benefit 
and 
not 
a 
cash 
flow 
benefit. 
Profitability 
can 
then 
be 
assessed 
against 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
products, 
including 
the 
number 
of 
families 
and hectares 
involved 
and 
the amount 
of 
labor 
provided. 
Thus 
a 
series 
of 
indicators that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
evaluate and compare 
individual 
activities.

and 
employment 
generated 
and cost

An 
additional  indicator 
that 
was 
calculated  includes  the

include 
a 
mix 
of

of 
income-generating 
activities 
suited 
to 
the 
various  conditions 
present 
in 
the 
western

(e.g., 
agro-ecological 
zones, 
levels 
of

Net 
cash 
flows for 
“with” 
subproject 
scenarios 
are 
all 
positive, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
simple 
totals 
and 
discounted 
net 
present 
value 
(Table 
4.3). 
This 
is 
an 
expected 
result, 
as 
many 
of 
the 
subprojects 
fund 
the 
purchase 
of 
inputs 
in 
return 
for 
families’  contribution 
of 
increased 
labor 
- 
in 
place 
of 
previous activities 
that 
required 
some 
outlay 
of 
cash 
resources. 
The 
biggest 
impact 
is 
the 
increase 
in 
production 
of 
marketable  commodities, 
substituting 
for 
subsistence 
production. 
The 
sale 
of 
vegetables, 
medicinal 
plants, 
honey and ecotourism 
services 
all 
provide 
new 
cash 
benefits 
to 
farmers. 
Net 
cash 
flows 
per 
family 
are 
quite significant, 
ranging 
roughly 
from 
$70 
per 
family 
per 
year 
(agroforestry) 
to 
over 
$10,000 
per 
year 
(greenhouse 
vegetables). 
Returns 
to 
family 
water 
tank 
investments 
include 
an  increased 
livestock 
production 
due 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
water; 
the 
benefits 
accrue 
as 
labor 
savings 
(no 
direct 
family 
labor 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
these 
tanks).

The 
extra 
cash 
gained 
by 
investing 
additional labor 
(over  and 
above 
that 
employed 
in 
the 
“without” 
project 
scenario) 
in 
these 
activities 
(Le., 
net 
cash 
flow 
per 
unit 
of 
labor) 
is 
perhaps 
the 
most 
crucial 
indicator 
of 
the 
incentive 
these 
investments 
provide 
for 
beneficiary involvement. 
These 
values  are 
all 
positive 
and 
range 
from 
US$4.75  (organic  vegetables) 
to 
US$121 
(sheep 
and 
vegetables) 
in 
daily 
incremental income per 
unit 
of 
incremental labor. 
This 
compares 
quite 
favorably 
with 
the 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
labor 
used 
US$3.50/day. 
Annual 
net 
cash 
flows 
per 
family 
are also substantial. 
After 
incorporating 
the 
economic 
opportunity 
cost 
of 
family 
labor, 
all 
activities continue 
to 
display 
positive net 
returns 
(Table 
4.4). 
Net 
present 
values 
are 
primarily 
useful 
in 
making 
capital 
allocation 
decisions. 
While 
capital 
may 
be 
scarce 
and 
potentially 
hinder 
beneficiaries 
in 
adopting 
these 
innovations, 
most 
of 
the 
activities 
require 
minimal 
capital 
outlays 
and 
make 
use 
of 
land 
and 
labor 
- 
items 
which 
are 
in 
relatively 
more 
plentiful 
and 
which 
could 
be 
devoted 
to 
higher 
end 
uses. 
Consequently, 
net 
returns 
to 
labor 
are 
uniformly 
positive. 
Returns 
to 
land 
display 
greater 
variability. 
Vegetable 
production 
has 
high 
returns, 
ranging 
from 
US$3,000 
to 
over 
US$lOO,OOO 
and 
reflecting 
the 
intensive 
use 
of 
land 
and 
complementary 
inputs. 
Conversely,  agroforestry, 
organic 
manures, 
maize 
and 
medicinal 
plants 
- 
more 
traditional 
land-based 
activities 
- 
yield 
much lower 
returns, 
from 
US$171 
to 
US$742.

The 
results 
for 
the 
analysis 
of 
net 
economic 
returns 
are presented 
in 
Table 
4.5. 
All 
the 
subprojects 
generate 
benefits 
beyond 
those 
in 
the 
“without” 
project 
scenario. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
agroforestry, 
the 
incremental 
benefits 
are 
low 
as 
they 
consist 
only 
of 
a 
single 
harvest 
of 
firewood 
in 
year 4 
of 
the 
activity.

The

exceeds 
40% 
in 
most 
cases 
and 
net 
present values 
(i-e.,

are 
substantial. 
Finally, 
the 
net 
economic 
returns 
per

of 
labor 
invested 
are 
all 
positive, 
yet 
lower 
than 
the 
similar

as

Most 
of 
the 
subprojects 
require a 
substantial 
investment 
either 
in 
capacity-building 
and 
strengthening 
of 
local 
organizations 
or 
in 
covering 
investment 
and 
input 
costs. 
Most 
subprojects 
range 
in 
total 
cost 
from 
US$15,000 
to 
US$80,000, 
of 
which 
a 
significant 
percentage 
is 
allocated 
to 
direct technical 
assistance 
to 
the 
communities. Agroforestry 
and 
medicinal 
plants 
activities require 
little 
in 
the 
way 
of 
resources, 
needing 
only 
a 
small 
initial 
allocation 
of 
technical 
assistance 
and 
materials 
to 
generate 
firewood 
and 
medicinal 
plants 
alongside 
the 
traditional production 
of 
maize 
and 
beans. 
The 
beneficiary 
co-financing 
is 
highly 
volatile. 
In 
agroforestry, 
reduced 
use 
of 
artificial 
fertilizers 
would 
lead 
to 
cost 
savings 
for 
the 
beneficiaries, 
implying 
a negative 
co 
financing  percentage. 
With 
the 
production 
of 
medicinal 
plants 
and 
organic 
manures, 
the 
large 
increase 
in 
labor 
implies 
that beneficiaries 
are 
contributing relatively 
more 
in 
terms 
of 
co 
financing.

in 
the

area. 
A 
legitimate 
question 
is 
whether 
the 
subprojects 
constitute a cost-effective 
way 
of 
generating employment. 
The 
final 
two 
columns 
of 
Table 
4.6 
tackle 
this 
issue 
by 
ranking 
the 
subprojects 
according 
to 
the 
cost 
of 
generating 
a 
day’s 
worth 
of 
employment. 
These 
costs 
range 
from 
US$2-3 
for 
all 
but 
three 
of 
the 
activities: 
ecotourism, 
apiculture 
and 
sheep 
and 
vegetables. 
Ecotourism 
and 
beekeeping 
require 
relatively 
larger 
inputs 
and 
provide relatively 
less 
in 
the 
way 
of 
employment. 
As 
mentioned 
earlier, 
the 
sheep 
and vegetables 
activity 
either requires 
very 
little 
labor 
input 
or 
this 
input 
is 
under-budgeted. 
As 
a 
result 
the 
cost 
per 
unit 
of 
labor 
generated 
is 
quite 
high.

It 
is 
important 
to 
stress 
that 
this 
indicator 
does 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
profitability 
of 
the 
activity, 
being 
rather a 
measure 
of 
cost-effectiveness. 
Indeed, 
in 
allocating available 
capital, 
decisions 
are 
best 
taken 
based 
on 
the 
net 
present 
value 
of 
the 
economic 
returns. 
However, 
if 
poverty 
reduction 
is 
an 
explicit 
target 
alongside 
economic 
development, 
then 
such figures 
might 
well 
be 
compared 
to 
those 
of 
other 
public 
sector 
projects 
to 
judge 
their 
relative 
cost-effectiveness. 
As 
a 
caveat 
it 
should 
be 
stressed 
that 
the 
employment 
generated 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
hiring 
of 
consultants 
to 
undertake 
the 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
is 
not 
included

Estimating 
aggregate 
measures 
of 
value 
for 
subprojects 
poses 
a 
challenge, 
given 
the 
ex 
ante absence 
of 
demand 
data. 
The 
actual 
allocation 
of 
beneficiaries’ 
demand 
across 
the 
different 
subproject 
types 
will 
be 
a 
function  of 
several  factors,  such 
as 
relative 
profitability, 
agro-ecological 
suitability 
to 
each 
specific 
location, 
degree 
of 
subproject 
complexity 
and 
co-financing 
requirements, 
among 
others. 
For 
illustrative 
purposes, 
the 
potential 
net 
economic benefits 
of 
the 
subproject 
models 
were 
distributed 
across 
the 
various 
categories 
and 
scaled-up 
to 
an aggregate subproject 
investment 
level 
of 
approximately 
US$26.5 
million. 
Given 
the 
emphasis 
on 
conservation, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
western 
Altiplano, 
the 
agroforestry 
activity 
is 
scaled 
up 
at 
25 
percent 
of 
total 
costs, 
while 
the 
productive 
components  each 
receive 
10 percent 
of 
investment. 
Family

Allocating 
subproject investments 
in 
this 
manner produces 
the outputs 
and 
economic 
results 
portrayed 
in 
subsequent 
columns 
of 
Table 
4.7. 
Due 
to 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
agroforestry 
and 
family 
water 
tank 
projects, 
no 
co-financing 
contribution 
is 
calculated 
for 
these 
subprojects. 
With 
respect 
to 
outputs, 
the 
subprojects, 
as 
a 
whole, 
would 
then 
be 
able 
to 
reach 
over 
116,000 
families 
and generate 
almost 
30,000 
job 
years, 
bringing 
90,000 
hectares under 
more 
sustainable management. 
The 
overall 
net 
private 
returns 
to 
the 
beneficiary 
families 
would 
reach close 
to 
US$50 
million, 
split 
roughly 
half 
between 
the 
productive 
and conservation 
subprojects. 
The 
net 
returns 
to 
the 
economy 
are 
also substantial, at 
over 
US$30 
million 
for 
the 
five-year 
period. 
During 
implementation, 
assessment 
of 
the 
absorptive  capacity 
of 
relevant  markets 
will 
be 
Page  62
Page 
58 
necessary 
to 
validate 
the 
potential 
for  such 
high 
returns. 
However, 
substantial 
reductions 
in 
the 
expected 
benefits 
would 
need 
to 
occur 
before 
the 
subprojects 
would 
fall 
below 
the 
break-even 
point. 
In 
particular, 
the  large 
proportion 
of 
funds 
invested 
in 
agroforestry, 
the 
low 
level 
of 
investment 
required and 
the 
general 
utility 
of 
the 
output 
- 
firewood 
- 
bodes 
well 
for 
the 
prospects 
of 
providing 
significant 
benefits 
to 
the 
economy 
while 
halting 
environmental 
degradation 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
note that 
the 
economic 
results presented above 
do 
not 
include 
the 
economic benefits 
from 
improved 
ecosystem  services 
in 
the 
project 
areas 
that 
would 
result 
from 
the 
productive 
and 
conservation 
subprojects. 
Improved 
on-site 
fertility, 
downstream 
watershed 
services, 
carbon 
storage 
and 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity 
are 
all 
likely 
to 
result 
to 
varying 
degrees 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
subprojects. 
These 
benefits 
are 
underestimated 
in 
economic 
terms, 
given 
that 
many 
of 
these 
services, 
particularly 
fertility 
and watershed  services 
will 
actually 
prevent 
the 
need 
to 
invest 
in 
fertilizer 
and 
alternative 
sources 
of 
supply 
of 
clean water and 
electric 
power 
(from 
hydropower facilities). 
C. 
Other Project 
Components 
and 
Sub-components 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
(Subcomponent 
la). 
Under 
this 
subcomponent, 
the 
project 
would 
fund 
a 
number 
of 
activities 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
local 
institutions 
and 
organizations 
in 
their 
capacity 
to 
plan 
and undertake 
natural 
resource management 
activities. 
A 
total 
of 
$4 
million 
(of 
which 
about 
$3 
million 
from 
the 
World 
Bank) 
would 
be 
made 
available 
for 
this 
sub-component. 
Given 
the 
demand-driven nature 
of 
the 
fund 
allocation, 
it 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
know 
in 
advance 
how 
many 
and 
which 
municipalities 
would 
be 
benefited. 
However, 
assuming 
distribution 
of 
resources 
proportional 
to 
the 
population 
of 
the 
54 
municipalities 
included 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
this 
sub-component 
would 
provide 
an 
average 
of 
$0.6 
per 
capita per 
annum. 
In 
1998, 
the 
weighted 
average 
of 
fiscal 
transfers 
to 
municipalities 
in 
the 
three 
departments 
of 
El 
QuichB, 
Huehuetenango and 
San 
Marcos 
was $20 
per 
capita, 
so 
that 
the 
project 
would 
add 
a 
modest 
3% 
on 
average 
to 
the 
municipalities’  current 
transfer 
absorption levels. 
Again 
the 
exact 
benefits 
of 
these 
capacity 
strengthening 
are 
hard 
to 
measure, 
however 
as 
stated 
earlier 
social capital 
for 
development remains 
a 
scarce 
input 
in 
achieving 
sustainable 
development 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
and, 
thus, 
the 
relative 
returns 
to 
this 
investment 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
quite 
high. 
Biodiversity 
Conservation (Component 
2): 
The 
component  includes 
a 
host 
of 
activities 
of 
diverse 
nature 
(community  level 
planning, 
institutional 
strengthening, 
studies, 
communication 
and 
outreach, 
biodiversity 
monitoring 
and evaluation). 
The 
benefits 
of 
the 
component’s  outputs 
are 
characterized 
by 
widespread local, 
national 
and 
global 
externalities and 
hence 
do 
not 
lend 
themselves 
readily 
to 
monetary 
quantification. 
However, 
a 
cost-effective 
analysis can 
be 
used 
to 
assess 
if 
the 
investment 
being envisioned 
is 
reasonable 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
intended 
outcomes. 
Total 
costs 
of 
the 
component 
is 
approximately 
$5.8 
million; 
the 
expected 
outcome 
is 
improved 
protected 
area 
management and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
over 
an area 
of 
1,750 
km2. 
This 
gives 
a cost 
per 
square 
kilometer 
of 
some 
$3,300, 
or 
$660 
per 
annum. 
This 
cost compares 
reasonably 
well 
with 
typical 
costs 
of 
biodiversity 
conservation 
in 
the 
LAC 
region: 
according 
to 
a 
recent 
review 
(Castro and 
Locker, 
2000), 
biodiversity funding 
per 
square 
km 
in 
the 
region 
(in 
the 
period 
1990- 
1997) 
can 
be 
clustered 
in 
five 
broad 
ranges, 
comprised between 
a a 
“low” 
$0 
- 
$30 
(or 
$0 
- 
$ 
4.2 
per 
annum) range 
prevailing 
in 
countries 
such 
as 
Chile 
and 
Argentina, 
and 
a 
“high” 
range 
of 
$2 
10 
to 
$12,000 
(or 
$30 
to 
$1,700 
per 
annum) 
observed 
in 
Colombia, 
Ecuador,  and 
much 
of 
Central America. 
The 
proposed 
project 
would 
then 
be 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
“high” 
range, 
which 
is 
not 
surprising 
for 
a 
country 
like 
Guatemala, 
where 
a 
combination 
of 
high 
biodiversity 
priorities, 
and 
of 
complex 
social, 
economic 
and 
institutional 
threats 
to 
biodiversity 
are 
likely 
to 
make 
costs 
of 
protection 
high 
in 
regional 
comparative 
terms.

The 
direct 
output 
of 
this 
component 
will 
be market 
and 
feasibility 
studies, 
followed 
by 
implementation 
of 
a 
range 
of 
initiatives 
to 
develop 
market 
and 
payment 
schemes 
for 
environmental 
services. 
Schemes 
aimed 
at 
improving 
watershed management 
will 
likely 
involve 
transfers 
between 
users 
and 
producers 
of 
hydrological 
services 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
improved 
land 
management. 
The 
net 
economic 
impact 
of 
such 
initiatives 
will 
be 
to 
lower 
the investment 
required 
to 
replace 
publicly 
or privately 
produced water 
supply, 
irrigation 
or 
hydropower 
services 
that 
are 
typically 
degraded 
over 
time. 
A 
series 
of 
other 
schemes 
aimed 
at 
biodiversity 
and carbon values 
are 
likely 
to 
result 
in 
the 
selling 
of 
environmental 
services 
provided 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano  to 
international 
users 
and 
markets. 
In 
other  words 
the 
net 
economic 
impact 
of 
these 
efforts 
will 
be 
to 
generate 
net 
inflows 
of 
financial 
resources 
to 
the 
country. 
Thus 
the 
Environmental 
Services 
Component 
will 
improve 
economic 
allocation 
of 
internal natural 
resources 
as 
well 
as 
generate 
additional external 
financial 
resources.

Other 
Economic 
Benefits 
not

in 
Monetary 
Terms 
Clearly, 
many 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
project 
are 
not 
amenable 
to 
quantification, 
either 
in 
biophysical or 
economic 
terms. 
Nonetheless, 
from 
an 
economic 
perspective 
given 
that 
the 
uncounted 
benefits 
are 
certainly 
in 
excess 
of 
any 
uncounted 
costs, 
the 
costs 
and 
benefits 
as 
quantified 
above 
can 
be 
assessed 
to 
see 
if 
the 
investment 
makes 
sense 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
the 
national 
economy. 
This 
is 
undertaken 
in 
Table 
4.8 
below 
and 
explained 
as 
follows. 
The 
total 
direct 
cost 
of 
the 
project 
scenario 
analyzed 
is 
$54.13 
million, 
with 
an 
additional 
$8 
million 
as 
a 
GEF 
donation. 
This 
is 
effectively 
a  payment 
by 
the 
international 
community 
to 
Guatemala 
for 
the 
effort 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
to 
conserve 
biodiversity 
of 
international 
importance. 
Of 
this 
about 
$41 
million 
was 
allocated 
in 
the 
analysis 
to 
be 
spent 
on 
Component 
1, 
the 
Rural 
Investment 
Component. 
As 
part 
of 
this 
investment, 
$34 
million 
will 
go 
to 
the 
subprojects, 
which 
were 
quantified 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
productive 
costs 
and 
benefits 
in 
Part 
4A. 
above. 
The 
net 
economic 
benefits 
in 
present 
value 
of 
this 
sub-component are expected 
to 
be 
on 
the 
order 
of 
$32 
million, 
Taking into 
account 
then 
the 
$21

that 
would 
go

While 
it 
is

true 
that

of 
the

may over-estimate 
the

will

in

it

GUATEMALA 
WESTERN 
ALTIPLANO NATURAL 
RESOURCES 
MANAGEMENT 
PROJECT 
Incremental 
Cost 
Analysis and 
Global 
Environmental 
Benefits 
Baseline Scenario 
The 
reduced 
biodiversity 
of 
the 
globally 
important 
Altiplano 
of 
Guatemala 
has 
fragmented 
remaining 
habitats  and 
threatens 
their 
future 
survival.  Current 
agricultural 
practices, 
on 
which 
the 
bulk 
of 
the 
Altiplano 
residents 
depend, 
are 
often  unsustainable 
and 
are 
slowly 
contributing 
to 
the 
erosion 
of 
the 
remaining biodiversity. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
rural population 
density 
is 
higher 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
than 
any 
other 
part 
of 
Guatemala, and 
the 
greatest 
areas 
of 
poverty 
are focused 
here. 
The 
economic development 
of 
this 
region, 
specifically 
the 
development 
of 
the 
area’s 
agricultural 
potential, remains 
of 
vital 
importance 
to 
Guatemala. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
Altiplano 
residents are 
poor 
Mayan 
indigenous 
peoples, 
and 
in 
the 
near 
future 
there are 
no 
reasonable alternatives 
to 
subsistence and near-subsistence 
agriculture 
as 
their 
means 
of 
survival. 
A 
detailed 
assessment 
of 
probable 
public 
investment 
(defined 
here 
as 
government 
agency 
spending 
and 
expected 
investments 
under 
the 
proposed 
project) 
over 
the 
five-year  project 
period 
was  conducted, 
detailing 
expected 
investments 
in 
Natural 
Resource 
Management 
(NRM) 
in 
the 
productive 
landscape, 
expected 
investments 
in 
conservation,  and  expected 
development 
of 
environmental 
services 
markets. 
These 
analyses 
of 
the 
Baseline 
Scenario 
are 
summarized 
here. 
Integrated 
NRM 
in 
Productive 
Landscapes. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Agriculture, 
Livestock, and 
Food 
(MAGA) 
is 
responsible 
for 
productive 
investments 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector. 
Its 
budget 
for 
the 
period 
1995-2000 
has 
averaged 
US$62.4 
million. 
Using 
1999 
pro-rated 
data for 
the 
departments 
included 
in 
the 
Altiplano, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
average 
MAGA 
annual 
expenditure 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
will 
be 
approximately 
US$20 
million 
(some 
US$lOO 
million 
over 
the 
five-year 
project 
period). 
The 
National 
Forests 
Institute 
(INAB) 
is 
charged 
with 
developing 
and 
implementing 
Guatemala’s 
forestry 
policy. 
Its 
budget 
for 
1995-2000 
has 
averaged 
US$6.3 
million 
annually, 
of 
which 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
only 
some 4% 
is 
spent 
in 
the 
project 
area. 
The 
baseline 
for 
INAB’s 
projected expenditure 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
is 
therefore 
about 
US$1 million. 
The 
planned 
World 
BanWGEF 
investment 
under 
this 
project 
is 
$US40.8 
million. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
GEF 
funding, 
these 
resources 
for 
Component 
1 
would 
be 
dedicated 
more  toward 
traditional  productive 
activities, 
with 
little 
or 
no 
funding 
for 
the 
now-proposed Conservation 
Subprojects. 
The 
total 
baseline 
for 
integrated 
NRM 
activities 
is 
therefore 
estimated at about 
US$ 
139 
million 
which 
would 
have 
generated 
very 
few 
global 
benefits. 
Knowledge 
about 
farming 
and 
NRM 
practices 
that 
are 
beneficial 
to 
conservation 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
biodiversity 
and 
agrobiodiversity 
outside protected 
areas 
would not 
have 
been 
developed 
or 
financed. 
Biodiversity 
Conservation in 
the 
SIGAP. 
Management of 
the 
National 
Protected 
Area 
system 
(SIGAP) 
is 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
National 
Council 
for 
Protected 
Areas 
(CONAP). 
The 
average 
annual 
budget 
of 
CONAP 
during 
the 
period 
1995-2000 
has 
been 
US$ 
3.2 
million. 
CONAP 
has 
currently 
limited 
presence 
in 
the 
Altiplano; 
based 
on 
1999 
information 
on 
distribution 
of 
staff 
costs, 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
only 
some 
US$ 
0.17 
million 
per 
year 
may 
have been 
spent 
in 
the 
region. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
non-project 
budget 
for 
SIGAP  protection 
is 
estimated  at  about 
US$ 
0.8 
million 
over 
the 
5 
years 
of 
the 
project.  Baseline 
biodiversity 
conservation 
efforts 
would 
focus 
essentially 
on 
the 
maintenance 
of the 
status 
quo, 
i.e., 
only 
very 
basic  levels 
of 
funding 
to 
maintain 
a 
nominal 
presence 
of 
the 
State 
in 
protected 
areas. 
In 
this 
scenario 
there 
will 
be 
virtually no 
funds 
for 
consolidation and 
expansion 
of 
the 
protected 
area 
system.

About 
$2.3 
million 
of 
World 
Bank 
and 
GoG 
funds 
are 
included 
in 
the 
proposed 
project 
for 
Component 
2. 
We 
do 
not 
include 
these 
in 
the 
baseline amount 
as 
these 
funds 
have 
been 
leveraged 
by 
the 
GEF 
funds 
themselves. 
The 
amount 
for 
the 
baseline scenario 
for 
this 
component 
is 
therefore 
only 
$0.8 
million. 
At 
best 
this 
would 
allow 
the 
tiny 
area 
currently 
in 
protected 
areas 
to 
be 
maintained 
as 
such 
but 
would 
not 
allow for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
protected 
area 
system, 
development 
of 
effective 
biological 
corridors, 
nor  for 
the 
effective  collaboration 
with 
local 
communities 
on 
issues 
of 
sustainable 
use 
and 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity. 
There 
would 
be 
no 
readily 
available 
monitoring 
tools 
for 
managing 
the 
various  natural 
ecosystems 
in 
the Western 
Altiplano. 
Environmental 
Service 
Markets. 
Despite 
considerable 
interest 
in 
Guatemala 
and 
more 
generally 
in 
Central 
America, 
experiences 
to 
date  are  scarce 
regarding  development 
of 
the 
institutional 
and 
regulatory 
framework required 
to 
promote markets 
for 
enviroiimental 
services. 
The 
government 
is 
currently 
pursuing 
a 
subsidy 
approach 
(as 
opposed 
to 
a 
market-based approach) 
to 
remunerate 
land 
users 
for  providing 
environmental 
services. 
The 
Program 
for 
Forest 
Incentives (PINFOR) 
delivers direct 
payments 
to 
forest 
producers 
using 
earmarked 
fiscal 
resources. 
Using 
the 
program’s 
budget 
for 
CY 
2001 
as 
a 
basis 
(Q3.5 
million, 
about 
US$460,000) 
it 
is 
estimated 
that 
the 
government’s 
non-project 
expenditure 
in 
this 
sector at 
the 
national 
level 
will 
be 
in 
the 
range 
of 
US$ 
1.8 
million 
during 
the 
project’s 
duration, 
supplemented 
by 
US$1.3 
million 
in 
World 
Bank 
funding 
under 
MIRNA. 
The 
total 
Baseline 
Scenario 
amount 
for 
this 
component 
would 
therefore 
be 
in 
the order 
of 
$3.1 
million. 
Under 
this 
scenario, 
current 
managers 
and  beneficiaries 
of 
development  programs 
would 
have 
no 
incentives 
to 
integrate 
biodiversity 
concerns 
because 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
policies 
or 
a 
framework 
that 
incorporates 
biodiversity 
into 
developing  environmental 
services 
markets. 
The 
development 
of 
environmental 
services 
markets 
would 
focus 
most 
likely 
entirely 
on 
water 
and perhaps also 
on 
carbon 
markets 
(which  would 
generate 
indirectly 
global 
benefits 
for 
biodiversity 
but 
would 
not 
necessarily 
ensure 
that 
globally 
important 
biodiversity 
would 
be 
specifically 
targeted). 
Global 
Environmental 
Objective 
The 
Global 
Environment objective 
of 
the 
project 
is 
to 
promote 
Conservation 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
globally 
significant 
biodiversity 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
broad 
range 
of 
strategies 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
These 
strategies focus 
on 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
concepts 
of 
sustainable use 
and 
conservation 
of  biodiversity 
within 
productive 
landscapes, 
direct 
investments 
in 
conservation, 
and 
incorporation 
of 
biodiversity 
issues 
into 
emerging 
environmental 
services 
markets. 
GEF 
ALTERNATIVE 
With 
GEF 
assistance, 
the 
Government 
of 
Guatemala 
would 
be 
able 
to 
undertake 
an 
expanded 
program 
that 
would 
generate 
both 
baseline 
national 
benefits 
and 
a 
more ambitious 
set 
of 
global 
benefits. 
The 
GEF 
Alternative 
would 
reorient 
the 
baseline scenario described 
earlier 
(essentially 
a 
traditional 
approach 
to 
rural 
development 
with 
minimal 
investments 
in 
conservation 
and sustainable 
use 
of 
biodiversity) 
and 
augment 
it 
to 
become an expanded 
program 
for 
addressing the 
global biodiversity 
objectives 
outlined 
above, 
The  GEF 
Alternative 
would 
be 
financed 
through 
the 
present 
proposed 
project 
which 
has 
been 
designed 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the capacity 
of 
the 
GoG 
and 
its 
partners 
to 
implement 
such 
an 
ambitious 
agenda. 
Incremental 
Costs 
The 
difference 
between 
the 
costs 
of 
the 
Baseline 
Scenario 
(US$ 
144.5 
million) 
and 
the 
GEF 
Alternative 
(US$ 
151.2 
million) 
is 
US$ 
10.3 
million 
(see 
table below). 
This 
represents 
the 
incremental 
cost 
for 
achieving 
global 
environmental 
benefits 
through 
sustainable 
livelihood 
projects 
with 
biodiversity 
conservation 
objectives, 
protectiiig 
sites 
with 
globally 
significant  biodiversity, 
and  development 
of 
environmental 
service 
markets  that  integrate 
biodiversity 
conservation  objectives.

quarters, etc.) 
totaling 
$1.1 
million 
equivalent 
are 
expected 
under 
this 
project, 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 
community 
subprojects. 
All 
Contracts 
are estimated 
to 
cost 
less 
than 
US$150,000 
equivalent 
and 
will 
be 
procured 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
at least 
three 
quotations received 
in 
response 
to 
a 
written 
invitation, 
which 
will 
include 
a 
detailed description 
of 
the 
works, 
including 
basic specifications, 
the 
required 
completion 
date, 
a 
basic 
form 
of 
agreement acceptable

Community 
Subprojects 
Community 
subprojects 
are 
grants 
to 
be 
provided 
to 
pre-existing, 
rural 
beneficiary 
associations 
in 
the 
54 
targeted 
municipalities 
to 
finance 
small-scale 
investments 
for 
sustainable 
production 
and 
natural 
resource 
conservation 
and 
are 
estimated 
to 
cost US$32.7 
million 
equivalent, 
including 
beneficiary 
contributions. 
There 
will 
be 
three 
types 
of 
subprojects 
eligible 
for 
grant financing: 
i) 
Sustainable 
Production 
Subprojects 
that  increase 
production 
and 
income 
without 
harming natural 
resources 
(e.g., 
greenhouses, 
low-impact 
product 
processing  facilities, 
and 
commercial 
reforestation); 
ii) 
Sustainable  Resource 
Management 
Subprojects 
for improving 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
(e.g., 
soil 
conservation 
in 
hillside 
cropping 
systems, 
livestock 
stables 
for 
organic 
fertilizer 
production, 
and waste management); 
and 
iii) 
Conservation 
subprojects 
that 
encourage 
environmental 
conservation 
in 
and 
around 
protected 
areas 
and 
communally- 
managed lands. 
Individual 
subprojects cannot 
be 
defined 
ex 
ante, 
though 
model 
subprojects 
have been 
developed and 
analyzed 
based 
on 
existing 
small 
projects 
and estimates 
of 
demand. 
Subproject  grants 
would 
consist 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
training, 
services, 
studies, 
limited 
goods 
and 
equipment, 
small works 
and  infrastructure, 
and 
limited 
fixed 
and 
working 
capital 
investments. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
each 
subproject 
would 
consist 
of 
a 
combination 
of 
goods, 
works 
and 
services. 
The 
contracts 
for 
these 
goods, 
works 
and services 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
small, 
as 
the 
average 
of 
individual 
grants 
will 
be 
approximately US$3 
8,000 
equivalent, 
including 
beneficiary 
contributions. 
Subproject 
funds 
would 
be 
disbursed 
directly 
to 
beneficiary 
associations 
with 
legal 
status 
and 
verified 
capacity 
to 
manage 
funds. 
Grant-financed  procurement  of 
goods, 
works 
and 
related 
services, 
which 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
small 
contracts 
in 
remote 
areas, 
would 
thus 
follow 
community-based 
procurement 
procedures 
where 
direct 
contracting 
would 
be 
used 
when 
the 
cost 
to 
the 
community 
of 
another 
procedure 
would 
be 
disproportionately 
high 
relative 
to 
the 
value 
of 
the 
procurement 
itself, 
and 
where 
only 
one 
qualified 
supplier/contractor 
is 
available 
locally. 
The 
Project 
Operational 
Manual, 
to 
be 
finalized 
as 
a 
condition of 
Page  71
Page 
67 
Loan 
effectiveness, 
would 
describe 
in 
details 
eligibility 
and 
selection 
criteria 
for 
subprojects, 
the 
process 
for 
identifying, 
developing 
and 
approving 
subprojects, 
and applicable  procurement 
and 
disbursement 
procedures. 
It 
would 
contain specific directives 
to 
guide 
the 
communities 
in 
the 
procurement 
of 
goods, 
contracting 
of 
works 
and 
selection 
of 
consultants and 
include 
sample 
procurement 
documents. 
To 
facilitate 
selection 
of 
firms 
or 
consultants, 
the 
PCU 
would 
maintain 
a 
roster 
of 
local 
service 
providers 
which would 
include local 
NGOs, 
more 
advanced 
communities, 
private 
firms 
and 
individual 
consultants 
from which 
beneficiary 
organizations 
could 
draw 
a 
shortlist 
of 
consultants 
or 
a 
list 
of 
suppliers 
to 
provide 
price 
quotations. 
The 
roster 
would 
be 
updated and 
published bi-annually 
by 
the 
PCU. 
A 
firm 
would 
be 
contracted 
to 
provide training 
to 
community 
organizations that 
have 
been 
identified 
as 
eligible 
to 
receive 
funds 
on how to 
carry out 
Shopping 
procedures, 
selection 
of 
consultants, 
financial reporting 
and 
filing. 
No 
prior 
review 
of 
contracts 
under 
subprojects 
with 
value 
under 
US$25,000 
equivalent 
would 
be 
required. 
Rather, a 
firm 
would 
be 
hired 
to 
carry 
out 
ex-post 
review 
of 
one 
in 
five 
contracts 
and 
to 
provide 
procurement 
assistance 
as 
needed. 
No 
procurement 
activities 
will 
be 
started 
with 
communities 
until 
the 
consultant 
has 
been  selected and 
his 
assignment 
started. 
Larger 
contracts 
for 
more 
comprehensive 
technical 
assistance, i.e. 
land 
use 
or 
potential production 
marketing 
and 
distribution, 
etc., 
estimated 
to 
cost 
more than 
US$25,000  equivalent, 
would 
be 
eligible 
for 
grant 
financing 
but 
would 
be 
procured 
by 
the 
PCU 
in 
accordance 
with 
procedures established 
in 
Tables 
A 
and 
B 
of 
this 
Annex. 
In 
addition, 
the 
PCU 
would 
also 
carry 
out 
post-review 
of 
contracts under 
community 
organizations 
at 
random. 
Project 
Funds 
Administration 
A 
firm 
would 
be 
contracted 
to 
administer 
project 
funds, 
acting 
as 
an “Administrator Agent” 
(AA). 
During 
appraisal, 
UNDP, 
IICA, 
and 
CIPREDA 
were 
identified 
as 
qualified 
potential Administrator 
Agents. 
See 
“Project 
Funds 
Administration” 
in 
“Financial Management” 
section, 
below. 
Operational 
Costs 
Project incremental 
recurrent 
expenses are 
estimated 
at 
US$3.9 
million 
equivalent 
and 
would 
be financed 
by 
the 
Bank 
on 
a 
gradually 
declining 
basis 
over 
the 
life 
of 
the 
project. 
Recurrent 
costs 
to 
be 
financed 
include  rental 
of 
facilities, 
vehicle 
operational 
costs, 
communication 
expenses 
related 
to 
project 
implementation, 
maintenance 
of 
procured 
goods, 
office 
supplies 
and 
utilities. 
B) 
Assessment 
of 
agency’s 
capacity 
to 
implement procurement 
The procurement 
assessment 
concluded 
that 
the 
overall project 
risk 
for 
procurement 
is 
high, 
as 
the 
PCU 
did 
not 
have procurement  capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
project. 
A 
procurement 
action 
plan 
summarized 
below, 
was  agreed 
with 
MAGA 
to 
implement 
the 
recommendations 
identified 
during 
appraisal  and 
included 
in 
the 
Procurement Capacity 
Assessment 
Report. 
Procurement Action 
Plan 
During 
negotiations, 
the 
following Action 
Plan 
was 
agreed 
upon: 
PLANNING: 
a) 
Draft 
detailed 
procurement 
plan 
for 
the 
first 
year 
will 
be 
discussed: 
by 
project 
negotiation; 
b) 
Detailed 
procurement 
plan 
for 
first 
year 
finalized: 
by 
effectiveness; 
c) 
Finalized 
Operational Manual: 
by 
project 
effectiveness; 
d) 
TORS for 
procurement 
auditing 
of 
subprojects: 
by 
project 
negotiations; 
e) 
Negotiate 
with 
the 
government 
an 
exception 
rule 
so 
that 
appointment 
of 
evaluation  committees 
and 
procurement 
decisions 
be 
delegated 
to 
the 
PCU. 
In 
case 
full 
delegation 
to 
the 
PCU 
is 
not 
granted, 
negotiate 
an 
increase 
of 
the 
US$27,000 
threshold 
to 
a 
more 
reasonable 
amount 
such 
as 
us$loo,ooo.

STAFFING: 
a) 
The 
PPU 
will 
hire 
a 
qualified 
Procurement 
Officer 
with 
at 
least 
five 
years 
of 
experience 
in 
Bank-financed 
procurement: 
by 
effectiveness; 
the 
TOR, 
CVs, 
and 
contract 
for 
the 
Procurement 
Officer 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
Bank's 
prior 
review; 
b) 
The 
PCU 
will 
hire 
two 
procurement 
assistants 
to 
assist 
the 
Procurement 
Officer 
after project 
effectiveness, 
prior 
to 
disbursement 
of 
subproject 
grants 
to 
communities. 
C) 
Procurement 
Plan 
The 
Borrower 
has 
prepared 
a 
draft 
of 
the 
procurement 
packages 
for 
the 
entire 
five 
years 
of 
the 
project. 
A 
final 
version 
of 
the 
procurement 
packages 
document 
will 
be 
presented 
and 
finalized 
at 
negotiations. 
The 
procurement 
plan 
will 
be 
updated 
each 
year and 
will 
need 
Bank 
approval 
before 
further 
procurement 
might 
be 
carried out. 
Table 
A 
provides 
the 
aggregate amounts 
for 
each 
procurement method. 
The 
PCU 
will 
be 
required 
to form 
ad-hoc 
evaluation 
committees; 
the 
TOR 
for 
the 
Procurement Specialist 
will 
specify 
that 
he/she 
will 
participate 
in 
the 
evaluation 
committees to 
ensure 
appropriate 
procedures 
during 
opening 
of 
proposals 
and 
evaluation. 
Bank 
Procurement 
Standard 
Bidding 
documents 
will 
be 
used 
following 
Bank 
guidelines 
and 
bidding 
documents 
for 
NCB 
and 
Shopping 
will 
be 
agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. 
Contract 
administration 
will 
be 
done 
by 
the 
PCU 
with 
support 
from 
the 
regional 
coordinators. 
The 
PCU 
will 
establish a records 
system 
to 
maintain 
records 
on 
all 
procurement 
in 
the 
project 
for 
purposes 
of 
auditing  reports. 
Initial 
Bank 
supervision 
missions 
will 
validate 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
adequate 
filing 
system 
of 
documents, and 
an 
electronic 
data 
base 
on 
procurement 
and 
financial 
records 
of 
contracts 
financed 
under 
the 
loan.

Overall 
Procurement 
Risk 
Assessment: 
High 
The 
overall 
risk 
assessment 
is 
based 
on 
possible 
implementation 
of 
the 
Action 
Plan recommended 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
PCU. 
A 
consultant 
will 
be 
hired 
to 
develop 
a  system 
for 
filing, 
monitoring 
and 
reporting 
procurement 
actions and 
it 
this 
will 
be 
in 
place 
by 
project 
effectiveness. 
Consequently 
the 
PCU 
is 
ineligible 
for 
FMR-based 
disbursements 
on 
procurement 
reporting 
grounds. 
However, 
such 
situation 
should 
be re-assessed 
when 
the 
consultant’s 
work 
is 
completed. 
The 
World 
Bank 
will 
provide 
close 
procurement supervision especially 
during 
the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation. 
It 
is 
expected 
that 
by 
second 
half 
of 
this 
year 
the 
Bank 
will 
have a 
procurement specialist 
permanently 
in 
Guatemala 
which 
will 
facilitate 
closer 
assistance. 
The 
risk 
is 
expected 
to 
reduce 
with 
time 
as 
experience 
is 
gained 
by 
the 
PCU. 
Risk 
factor 
will 
be 
reassessed 
after  the 
first 
year 
of 
project 
implementation 
and the 
risk 
assessment 
will 
then 
be 
upgraded 
if 
appropriate. 
Frequency 
of 
procurement 
supervision 
missions 
proposed: 
Project 
supervision 
will 
include  post 
reviews, and since 
this 
is 
a 
high 
risk 
case 
scenario, 
supervision 
missions 
and 
post 
reviews 
will 
be 
carried 
out every 
six 
months 
during 
at 
least 
the 
first 
two 
years 
of 
project implementation 
and 
will 
include 
an 
independent 
review 
every 
year. 
The 
frequency 
of 
post 
reviews 
and 
independent 
reviews 
may 
be 
reduced 
based 
on 
progress 
of 
project 
performance. 
All 
direct contracting 
(single 
source 
contracts) 
notwithstanding 
contract value 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
prior 
review 
(other 
than 
under 
community 
subproject 
grants). 
Modifications to 
all 
contracts 
would 
be 
made 
as 
set 
forth 
in 
Appendix 
1, 
Paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
Guidelines, 
notwithstanding 
the 
contract value. 
A 
systematic 
ex-post 
review 
by 
the 
Bank 
would 
be 
carried out 
once 
a year 
and 
would 
result 
in 
review 
of 
about 
40 
percent 
of 
all 
contracts. 
Confirmation 
would 
be 
sought 
on 
prior 
review 
arrangements 
during 
negotiations.

Procurement 
Audits. 
It 
has 
been 
agreed 
that 
periodic 
procurement 
audits 
would 
be carried 
out 
for 
subprojects. 
TORS 
will 
be 
reviewed 
prior to 
negotiation 
and incorporated 
in 
the

of 
the 
project 
will 
be 
carried 
out, 
through 
cooperative agreements 
(Convenios 
de 
Cooperacidn) 
with 
MARN, 
CONAP 
and 
INAB. 
An 
Executive 
Steering 
Committee  formed 
by 
MAGA 
and

and 
biodiversity 
conservation 
activities. 
A 
Project Coordinating 
Unit 
(PCU) 
would 
be 
established 
within 
MAGA, 
under 
Ministerial 
Decree, 
and 
it 
will 
be 
physically 
located 
in 
the 
project 
area 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano to 
provide overall 
coordination 
of 
component 
activities 
and 
carry

PCU 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
participating 
agencies, 
mainly 
through 
its 
regional offices 
and 
local 
staff.

and 
will 
coordinate 
with 
the 
participating  implementing 
institutions  that 
the 
agreed 
counterpart 
contribution 
is 
included 
in 
their 
annual 
budgets and 
that 
the 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
to 
the 
project 
account opened 
by 
AA, 
which 
according 
to 
the current 
MHCP’s 
procedures, 
would 
be 
monthly, or 
at least 
on 
quarterly 
basis. 
The 
required 
counterpart 
contribution 
of 
the 
project

integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
(SIAF). 
The 
counterpart 
funds 
transferred 
by 
the 
other 
participant 
implementing 
agencies 
are 
recorded 
as 
executed 
in 
their 
records, nevertheless, 
the 
PCU 
will 
keep 
appropriate 
controls on 
the 
receipt 
and

funds. 
Project 
Funds 
Administration 
A 
firm 
would 
be 
contracted 
to 
administer 
project 
funds, 
acting 
as 
an 
Administrator 
Agent 
(AA), 
to 
ensure 
adequate 
flow 
and efficient, 
and opportune disbursement 
of 
funds. 
MAGA 
and 
the 
other 
implementing 
institutions 
have agreed 
to 
hire 
the 
services 
of 
the 
AA. 
Among 
the 
advantages 
of 
contracting 
this 
service 
are 
included: 
(i) 
it 
responds 
to 
GoG’s 
policy to 
avoid 
the 
proliferation 
of 
institutionalized 
Funds, 
(ii) 
transparency; 
and 
(iii) 
as 
the 
project 
is 
multi-institutional 
and 
multi-sectoral, 
contracting 
out 
this 
service 
avoids 
replicating 
administrative 
procedures 
in 
four 
institutions. The 
AA 
will 
be 
in 
charge 
of 
the custody 
of 
funds 
transferred 
from 
the 
SAs 
provided 
through 
the 
loan 
and 
grant, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
counterpart 
funds; 
making 
the 
disbursements 
approved 
by 
the 
PCU; 
and 
ensuring 
that 
these 
disbursement 
follow 
procurement 
and 
disbursement 
procedures  agreed 
with 
the 
Bank. 
MAGA 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
implementing 
agencies 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
selection and 
contracting 
of 
the 
AA. 
During 
appraisal, 
UNDP, 
IICA, 
and 
CIPREDA 
were 
identified 
as 
qualified potential Administrator 
Agents. 
MAGA 
has 
informed 
the 
World 
Bank 
that 
it 
wishes 
to 
have 
the 
flexibility 
to 
select 
and 
direct 
contract 
CIPREDA 
as 
the 
AA. 
In 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
do 
so, 
MAGA 
has 
advised 
the 
World 
Bank 
that 
100% 
of 
the 
costs 
for 
both 
the 
administration 
of 
the 
loan 
and 
the 
grant 
will 
be 
covered 
by 
national 
counterpart 
funds.

de 
Cooperacidn 
Internacional 
para 
la 
Preinversidn,

Livestock 
and Food. 
According 
to 
the 
Acuerdo Gubernativo 
No.

demonstrated experience 
and 
capacity 
in 
the 
management 
of 
funds 
for 
projects 
funded 
by 
international 
donors 
and the  GoG. 
Prior 
to

reporting 
arrangements. 
Financial 
statements 
and reports 
will 
be 
prepared 
in 
formats 
satisfactory

sections 
of 
the 
FMRs, 
will 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
no 
later 
than 
45 
days 
after the end 
of 
each 
reporting

The 
PCU 
will 
be 
responsible 
for 
the 
financial 
management 
of 
the 
project, and 
will 
implement 
procedures 
that 
ensure 
an 
adequate 
segregation 
of 
duties, 
procedures 
documented 
in 
the 
operational manual. 
The

project 
funds 
and 
review 
of 
compliance 
with 
the 
loan 
and 
grant 
agreements, 
by 
an 
AA, 
will 
be 
an additional factor 
contributing 
to 
the 
segregation 
and 
ensuring 
compliance 
of 
the 
established procedures.

specifying 
the 
sources 
of 
funds, 
by 
June 
of 
each year, 
after 
approval 
of 
the 
budget 
by 
Congress, 
MAGA 
and 
the 
participating 
implementing 
agencies 
provide 
the 
MHCP 
the 
estimated 
flow 
of 
funds, 
based 
on 
what 
MHCP 
assigns 
monthly 
quotas; 
counterpart 
funds 
will 
be 
transferred 
by 
the 
MHCP 
on monthly 
allocations, 
as 
requested 
and approved 
by 
MAGA 
and 
the 
participating 
implementing 
institution 
to 
the 
project 
accounts  opened 
by 
the

and 
report  through 
the 
MAGA 
integrated 
financial 
management 
system 
(SIAF) 
the 
expenditures 
as 
incurred 
for 
the 
loan, grant 
and 
counterpart 
funding; 
the 
participant 
implementing 
agencies 
report 
the 
transfer 
of 
counterpart

Accounting, 
Policies,  and 
Procedures. 
Accounting 
and 
budgetary 
records 
will 
be 
maintained 
in 
accordance 
with 
the GoG’s 
procedures and 
International 
Accounting 
Standards. 
The 
project 
accounting 
manual 
to 
be 
developed 
as 
part 
of 
the 
financial 
management  system 
will 
describe 
the 
policies 
and 
procedures.

department 
of 
MAGA 
does 
not 
have 
the 
resources 
to

for 
the 
project. 
Due 
to 
the 
complexity 
of 
the project, 
the 
involvement 
of 
several 
implementing 
agencies, 
and 
the 
significant 
workload 
that 
will 
represent 
the 
subprojects 
with 
community 
organizations 
and 
NGOs, 
it 
has 
been

A

systems 
and capacity was 
carried 
out 
during 
preparation, and

As 
the 
PCU 
is 
to

under

the Bank’s financial 
management 
assessment 
concluded that 
MAGA 
did 
not 
have 
in

adequate 
financial 
management system 
for 
the project. 
MAGA 
has expressed 
its

and

will 
be 
held 
in 
US 
Dollars 
in 
the 
Banco 
de 
Guatemala 
(BANGUAT), 
from which 
the 
PCU 
will 
transfer 
funds 
to 
the 
project Administrator Agent 
account 
to 
cover 
the project 
needs 
of 
eligible 
expenses. 
The 
SAs 
are 
only 
for 
eligible 
expenditures 
under 
the loan and 
grant 
(under 
no 
circumstances 
may 
funds 
in 
the 
SA 
be 
used 
to 
cover 
the 
share 
of 
counterpart 
expenditures). 
Transfers 
from 
the 
SA to 
other 
bank 
accounts 
will 
only 
be 
permitted 
to 
meet 
eligible 
expenditures 
for 
a 
limited 
period 
of 
less 
than 
30 
days. 
Total 
advances 
to 
the 
SA 
at 
any 
given 
time 
would 
not 
exceed 
the 
“authorized 
allocation” 
specified 
in 
the 
Loan 
and 
Grants Agreements. 
For 
replenishment 
of 
the 
advance, 
the 
PCU 
will 
prepare 
monthly 
(in 
any 
case, 
no 
more 
than 
quarterly) 
requests 
for 
reimbursement 
of 
expenditures 
made. 
Use 
of

Loan 
and grant 
withdrawal 
applications can 
be 
supported 
by 
SOEs 
for expenditures 
relating 
to 
contracts 
that 
are 
not 
subject 
to 
the 
Bank’s 
prior review 
(see 
Table 
B 
in 
Annex 
6). 
Reimbursement 
of 
other  expenditures 
would 
require 
submittal 
to 
the 
Bank 
of 
full 
supporting 
documentation. 
Documents 
in 
support 
of 
SOEs 
must 
be maintained 
by 
the 
PCU 
at 
least 
until 
one year 
after 
the 
Bank 
has 
received the audit report 
for 
the 
fiscal 
year 
in 
which 
the last 
loan 
and 
grant 
withdrawal 
was 
made. 
Such 
documents 
must 
be 
available 
to 
review 
by 
the 
external 
auditors 
and 
Bank 
staff.

Other 
procedures. 
Upon 
request 
from 
the 
Borrower 
and 
subject 
to 
the Bank’s 
approval, 
payments 
may 
be 
made: 
(i) 
directly 
to 
a 
third 
party 
(supplier 
or 
consultant) 
for 
goods, 
works, 
and 
services; 
or 
(ii) 
to 
a

bank 
for 
expenditures against 
a

Special 
Commitment covering 
a

Retroactive 
financing. 
An 
amount equal 
to 
US$4.08 
million 
equivalent 
of 
eligible 
expenditures 
made 
after 
January 
1, 
2003 
(but 
not 
more 
than 
12 
months 
prior 
to 
loan 
signing) 
may 
be 
financed 
retroactively 
from 
the 
project’s 
SA. 
These 
funds 
would 
be used 
to 
accelerate 
project implementation 
by 
allowing 
a 
project 
manager 
and 
key 
project 
staff 
to 
be 
employed 
prior 
to

Guatemala 
Western 
Altiplano 
Natural 
Resources 
Management 
Project 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
and 
Participation Plan 
This 
document 
summarizes 
the 
Participation 
Plan 
and Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan 
(IPDP). 
The 
two 
documents 
have 
been 
combined 
because some 
95% 
of 
the 
rural 
residents 
within 
the 
54 
municipalities 
in 
the 
project 
area are 
indigenous 
Mayans. 
For 
this 
reason, 
the 
Western 
Altiplano Natural 
Resources 
Management 
Project 
constitutes an 
IPDP 
as 
per 
the 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.20. 
However, 
because 
indigenous 
issues 
are 
so 
central 
to 
the 
Project’s 
planning 
and 
implementation, 
a 
separate 
IPDP 
was prepared, based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
(an extensive  socio-ethnographic 
evaluation 
of 
the 
project 
area) 
and 
other consultations. 
The 
importance 
of 
ensuring 
the 
informed participation 
of 
the 
beneficiaries, 
especially 
of 
the 
indigenous 
peoples 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
cannot 
be 
overstated. 
They 
need 
to 
be 
fully 
involved 
in 
both 
planning 
(as 
has 
been 
the 
case), 
preparation 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
Informed 
participation 
means 
that 
there 
will 
be: 
direct 
and 
full 
consultation 
with 
beneficiaries, 
their 
direct participation 
in 
decision-making 
within 
the project, 
and transparent 
adequate 
knowledge 
of 
project activities. 
This 
IPDP/Participation Plan 
is 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.20 
on 
Indigenous 
Peoples. 
It 
is 
based 
on 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
set 
of 
prerequisites 
outlined 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.20:  14 (Prerequisites). 
The 
set 
of 
issues 
outlined 
in 
OD 
4.20: 
15 
(Content) 
are 
summarized 
below. 
Legal Framework 
The 
Political 
Constitution 
of 
Guatemala, 
decreed 
on 
31 
May 
1985, 
in 
articles 
66-70, 
contains 
a special 
section 
entitled 
“Indigenous  Communities.” 
These 
laws 
recognize 
the 
existence 
of 
diverse ethnic 
groups 
and 
demand  respect 
for 
their 
lands,  customs,  languages,  dress 
and 
cultural 
rights. 
Article 
67 
states, 
“Indigenous 
communities 
and others 
that 
possess 
lands 
that 
historically 
have 
belonged 
to 
them 
and 
that 
traditionally 
have 
been 
managed and 
administered 
[by 
them] 
in 
a special way, 
will 
maintain 
this 
system.” 
Article 
68 continues, 
“By 
means 
of 
special 
programs and 
adequate 
legislation, 
the 
State 
will 
provide 
state 
lands 
to 
those 
communities 
that 
need 
them 
for 
their 
development.” 
Article 
70 
contains 
arrangements such 
that articles 
66 
- 
69 
may 
be 
made 
into 
law 
by 
means 
of 
a special 
decree. 
Although 
this 
Constitution 
was 
promulgated 
in 
1985, 
up 
to 
the 
present 
date 
no 
regulations 
and 
rules 
have 
been 
promulgated regarding 
these 
articles. 
Hence, 
the 
legislation 
has 
not 
been 
become operational,  and 
no 
concrete  orders 
to 
emit 
judicial 
decisions and 
sanctions, 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
rights 
contained 
in 
these 
articles 
are 
violated,  have 
been 
given. 
The 
Peace 
Accords 
of 
1996 
stress 
the 
rights 
of 
indigenous 
peoples 
and importance 
of 
taking 
into 
account 
their 
views 
regarding 
actions 
that 
affect 
them 
directly. 
The 
Accord 
on 
Socioeconomic 
Issues 
and 
the 
Agrarian 
Situation 
(ASESA) 
and 
the 
Accord on 
the 
Identity 
and 
Rights 
of 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
(ASIDPI), 
signed 
in 
December 
1996 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Peace 
Agreement, 
recognize that 
the 
“Subject 
of 
Land” 
and 
the 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
play 
a 
central 
role 
in 
development. 
The 
ASESA 
states 
that 
for 
the 
structural 
evolution 
of 
the agrarian 
sector, 
land 
tenure 
and 
use 
of 
land 
must 
be 
advanced 
in 
a 
way 
that 
makes 
its 
goal 
the 
incorporation 
of 
the 
rural 
population, 
and above 
all 
the 
indigenous 
population, 
in 
economic, 
social 
and 
political 
development. 
Moreover, 
security 
of 
land 
tenure 
is 
to 
be 
the 
basis 
for improving 
their 
social 
welfare 
and 
is 
to 
be 
the 
guarantee 
of 
their 
liberty 
and 
dignity. 
Similarly, 
in 
1997 
the 
Government 
of 
Guatemala 
ratified 
Treaty 
169 
of 
the 
International 
Labor 
Organization 
(ILO) 
relative 
to 
the 
rights 
of 
indigenous 
peoples. 
Treaty 
169, 
in 
articles 
15 
to 
19, 
deals 
with 
the 
theme 
of 
land. 
It 
establishes 
that 
the 
rights 
of 
property 
and 
possession 
of 
land 
that 
traditionally 
belong 
to 
indigenous 
peoples 
should 
be 
recognized. 
Treaty 
169, 
in 
article 
61, 
also establishes 
that 
“whenever 
legislative 
or 
administrative 
measures 
that  have 
the 
potential 
to 
affect 
Page  90
Page 
86 
them 
directly 
are 
foreseen,” 
governments  should “consult 
with 
affected 
peoples, 
by 
appropriate 
means 
and 
especially 
through 
their 
representative 
institutions.” 
In 
addition, 
article 
6.1 
.c  states, 
“means 
for 
the 
full 
development 
of 
the 
institutions 
and 
initiatives 
of 
these 
peoples 
must 
be 
established, and 
in 
appropriate 
cases, 
they 
must 
be 
given 
the 
resources 
necessary 
for 
this 
end.” 
Guatemala 
also 
has 
ratified 
other 
international 
treaties 
that 
include 
clauses 
pertaining 
to 
indigenous 
communities, 
such 
as 
the 
International 
Convention 
on 
Biological 
Diversity 
(preamble and articles 
8 
and 
10). 
The 
Convention 
recognizes 
the 
close interdependence 
between 
forms 
of 
traditional 
indigenous 
life 
and 
prudent 
use 
of 
biological 
resources. 
It 
also acknowledges 
that 
signatories 
promise 
to 
respect, 
preserve 
and 
maintain 
the 
knowledge, innovations, 
and practices 
of 
indigenous and 
local 
communities 
that 
involve 
traditional 
lifestyles 
pertinent 
to 
the  conservation 
and  sustainable 
use 
of 
biological 
diversity, 
and 
to 
promote 
their 
wise 
use, 
with 
the 
approval 
and 
participation 
of 
those 
who 
possess 
this 
knowledge, 
innovations, 
and practices. 
In 
this 
way, 
the 
equitable 
distribution 
of 
the 
benefits 
derived 
from 
their 
use 
will 
be 
promoted. 
Baseline 
Data 
Based 
on 
the 
Social 
Assessment, 
local 
and 
national 
Institutional 
Analyses, 
Policy 
Analysis, 
Biodiversity 
Evaluation, 
and 
Technical 
Analyses carried 
out 
during 
Project 
preparation 
to 
provide 
baseline 
data, 
the 
following 
were 
identified 
as 
fundamental 
issues 
for 
indigenous development 
(see 
project 
files 
for 
details). 
Lands and 
territories. 
In 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
there 
is 
widespread 
traditional stability 
of 
indigenous 
lands 
and territories, 
but 
this 
has 
not 
been 
sufficiently 
recognized 
by 
the 
political 
administrative 
structure 
of 
the 
country. 
Many 
of 
the 
indigenous communities 
possess 
communal 
lands 
or 
a 
combination 
of 
private 
and 
communal titles. 
Conflicts 
have 
arisen 
where 
private 
parties 
have attempted 
to 
(and 
often 
succeeded 
in) 
registering 
communal 
lands 
as 
private holdings. 
A 
lack 
of 
definition 
of 
territorial 
limits 
between 
municipalities, communities 
and  forests  also 
persists. 
The 
project 
could 
assist 
with 
the 
participatory 
definition 
of 
boundaries 
of 
communal 
lands 
where 
requested, 
but 
should 
refer 
such concerns 
to 
and 
might 
facilitate 
the 
linkages 
to 
CONTIERRA 
(GoG land conflict 
management agency) 
where 
appropriate. 
While not 
to 
be 
undertaken 
by 
the 
project, 
it 
is 
important 
to 
note 
the 
following 
recommendations 
resulting 
from 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
and 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
IPDP: 
(i) 
a geo-referenced 
inventory 
should be 
carried out 
of 
communal 
lands 
in 
each 
municipality, 
an 
inventory 
of 
sacred places, 
legalization 
and 
regularization 
of 
use 
rights 
to 
communal 
lands, 
and, 
thereafter, 
participatory 
physical 
demarcation 
of 
the 
above; 
(ii) 
a 
proposal 
for 
a 
law 
to 
protect 
communal 
lands 
by 
explicitly 
titling 
them 
in 
the 
name 
of 
the 
indigenous 
communities 
should 
be 
prepared 
and  presented 
to 
Congress; 
(iii) 
a 
National  Council 
of 
Communal Lands 
(a 
representative 
body 
for 
communities 
which 
own 
communal 
property 
resources) 
should 
be 
created 
as 
an 
instrument 
for 
the 
sound management 
of 
natural 
resources, 
and 
(iv) 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
cooperation 
between 
indigenous 
communities 
that 
are 
divided 
by 
national 
frontiers, 
and 
in 
accord 
with 
article 
32 
of 
ILO 
Treaty 
169, 
a 
Plan 
for 
Cross-Frontier 
Cooperation 
with 
Mexico 
should 
be 
elaborated. 
In 
fact, 
while 
recognizing that 
assistance 
in 
assuring 
comprehensive 
legal 
titling 
of 
communal 
lands 
is 
of 
central importance 
to 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
in 
the 
Altiplano, 
the 
proposed 
project 
will 
not 
become 
involved 
in 
this, 
beyond 
referring 
communities 
to 
other 
entities 
that 
can 
provide 
this 
service. 
Local 
institutionality. 
An 
initial 
systematization 
of 
the 
management 
of 
communal 
lands 
belonging 
to 
indigenous 
peoples reveals 
the 
existence 
of 
traditional or 
“customary” 
law,  along 
with 
existing legal 
bodies 
that 
implement 
these 
laws. 
There 
is 
a 
rich 
tradition 
of 
managing 
the 
communal 
lands 
in 
accordance 
with 
such 
law 
which 
has 
a 
ritual 
and 
ceremonial 
character. 
The 
tradition 
includes 
surveying 
practices, 
definitions 
of 
territories 
and 
individual 
usufruct 
rights,  designation 
of 
authorities,  and 
rules 
to 
apply 
in 
cases 
of 
conflict 
between 
communities 
or 
between 
members 
of 
the 
same 
community. 
These 
mechanisms 
of 
conflict 
management 
for 
land and 
for 
assigning 
usufruct 
rights 
are 
applied, 
with 
variations, 
in 
many 
communities. 
The 
major 
difficulty 
in 
making 
them 
effective 
results 
from 
the 
intrusion 
of 
external 
mechanisms  and  reasoning, 
such 
as 
a 
parallel 
structure 
of 
state 
sanctioned 
power 
in 
any 
given 
Page  91
Page 
87 
community. 
The 
recognition 
of 
the 
traditional 
systems 
the 
communities 
use 
to 
resolve 
conflicts 
related 
to 
land 
tenure 
should 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
process 
that 
strengthens and recovers 
indigenous 
norms, 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Peace 
Accords. 
Traditional 
management 
of 
natural 
resources. 
Traditional 
management 
is 
firmly 
maintained 
through 
a 
system 
of 
internal 
regulations  that 
explicitly 
or 
implicitly 
dictate 
community 
activities 
in 
relation 
to 
forests, water, 
and 
other 
community 
resources. 
These 
regulations 
contain 
a 
set 
of 
norms 
and sanctions 
that 
are 
respected 
by 
the 
population 
and  form 
part 
of 
what 
is 
termed 
the 
local 
institutionality 
for 
the 
management 
of 
natural 
resources. 
Local 
institutionality 
in 
the 
management 
of 
natural 
resources 
is 
exercised 
through 
the 
traditional 
social 
structure 
(e.g., 
communal 
assemblies). 
Systems 
of 
local 
government  such 
as 
auxiliary 
mayors, 
councils 
of 
elders, 
and 
parcialidudes 
(patrilineal 
groups) 
are 
important 
in 
this 
context. 
It 
merits 
emphasizing 
that 
these 
entities constitute 
the 
link 
with 
the 
municipal 
and 
state 
authorities. 
Natural 
resources 
and protected 
areas. 
In 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
of 
Guatemala 
there 
are 
significant 
remnants 
of 
communal 
lands 
and 
forest 
which 
have ecological, 
economic 
and 
sociocultural importance 
not only for 
local 
populations 
but 
also 
regionally 
and 
globally. Considering 
that 
in 
most 
of 
the 
municipal 
and 
communal 
forests 
traditional 
management 
practiced 
by 
local 
populations 
is 
prevalent, 
it 
is 
important 
that 
the fundamental 
role 
the 
indigenous 
communities 
have 
in 
the 
use, 
management 
and conservation of 
natural 
resources also 
be 
considered. 
In 
this 
sense, 
the 
communal 
forests  have been an 
unrecognized 
model 
of 
protected 
areas, 
established 
by 
the 
communities. 
These 
forests 
are 
closely 
linked 
to 
environmental 
services 
for 
carbon 
sequestration, 
production and 
conservation 
of 
water, 
prevention 
of 
erosion,  and 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity, 
among 
other 
things. 
Among 
the 
environmental 
services, 
conservation 
of 
water 
sources 
is, 
at 
the 
present 
time, 
the 
most valued 
in 
all 
the 
places 
visited, and 
the 
one 
about 
which 
the 
communities 
express 
their 
central 
concerns. 
Indigenous 
productivity 
and 
economy. 
The 
agrarian 
systems 
of 
production 
found 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
are 
primarily 
of 
the 
infra-subsistence  and 
subsistence 
type. 
Their 
basic characteristic 
is 
that 
the 
harvest 
is 
destined 
to 
cover 
part 
of 
the 
family’s 
required 
food 
needs, 
though 
in 
many 
cases 
it 
is 
insufficient. 
Agriculture 
of 
the 
surplus 
and 
commercial 
type 
is 
insignificant, 
and 
is 
currently 
concentrated 
in 
the 
production 
of 
coffee. 
Notwithstanding 
their 
reduced 
area 
and 
limited 
agricultural productive 
capacity, 
the 
small 
farms 
of 
the 
Altiplano 
have 
a 
strategic 
importance 
in 
national 
food 
production. 
Nearly 
60% 
of 
the 
national 
production 
of 
maize 
and 
potatoes, 
and 
30% 
of 
the 
production 
of 
small 
animals 
comes 
from 
this 
zone. 
The 
major 
limits 
to 
agricultural production 
are 
inadequate land, 
scarcity 
of 
irrigation, 
lack 
of 
road 
access, 
lack 
of 
connection 
with 
markets, 
and 
lack 
of 
economic 
resources. 
The 
growth 
of 
regional 
population 
accelerates 
the 
reduction 
of 
agricultural 
lands 
into 
micro 
units 
and 
reduces 
possibilities 
for 
investment 
in 
perennial 
crops 
or 
ground 
cover. 
The 
majority 
of 
farm 
producers 
in 
the 
Altiplano 
combine 
agriculture 
with 
other  subsistence strategies, 
among 
which 
may 
be 
mentioned: 
craft 
production 
and 
commerce 
(Solola,  Totonicaptin); 
migratory 
labor 
(Cuchumatanes, 
El 
Quiche 
and 
San 
Marcos); 
local 
wage 
labor; 
and, 
at a 
low 
level, 
animal 
husbandry. 
It 
is 
also 
noteworthy that 
many 
Altiplano 
farmers 
cultivate 
lands 
rented 
along 
the 
south coast 
of 
the 
country. 
Craft 
production, 
regional 
commerce, and 
forestry 
activities 
have 
been and can be 
adequate 
incentives 
to 
avoid 
sole 
dependence 
on 
farming. 
As 
the 
entire 
Social 
(and 
Ethnographic) 
Assessment demonstrated, 
this 
diversification 
has 
permitted 
the 
reduction 
of 
social 
pressure 
on 
natural 
resources. 
This 
could 
be 
of 
special 
importance 
for 
and 
directed especially 
to 
infra-subsistence and 
subsistence producers. 
Organizational 
Management: 
Organizational 
management 
of 
production 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
and 
improve 
the 
productive 
chains, 
including improved 
commercialization, 
may 
present 
options 
for 
thousands 
of 
Altiplano 
producers, 
especially 
for 
producers 
of 
surplus. 
Identity 
and 
participation. 
The 
participation 
of 
indigenous 
communities 
in 
the 
project should 
be 
managed 
as 
a 
process 
that 
leads 
to 
local 
“empowerment” 
with 
respect 
to 
diverse 
initiatives 
for 
conservation 
and 
development. 
Spaces 
for 
self-management 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
participating  communities  should

facilitated, 
so 
that 
they 
take 
ownership  of 
and 
follow-up 
on 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
project. 
This 
will 
be 
possible 
if 
the 
project 
bases 
itself 
on 
the 
local 
systems 
of 
organization 
that 
already 
exists 
in 
the 
region, 
and 
if 
the project 
promotes 
the 
initiatives 
that 
these 
local 
organizations 
have 
already 
begun 
to 
implement, 
Protection 
of 
water 
sources, 
for 
example, 
has 
been 
an 
issue 
around 
which 
numerous 
rural Altiplano 
communities 
have 
been integrated. 
Strategy 
for 
Indigenous 
Participation 
General 
participation 
strategy. 
In 
order 
to 
effect 
indigenous development 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
project, 
a 
process 
of 
integrating 
indigenous 
community 
organizations 
(whether 
formal 
and/or 
traditional) 
at 
the local, 
municipal 
and 
regional 
levels 
will 
be 
required 
(see 
Annex 
13). 
It 
is 
necessary 
that 
the 
project 
reach 
out 
to 
include 
(i) 
at 
all 
levels, 
whether 
municipal or 
regional, 
associates 
of 
the 
project 
who 
are 
able 
to 
communicate 
with 
indigenous peoples 
in 
their 
own 
respective 
languages, 
respecting 
in 
all 
cases 
the 
spiritual 
aspects 
and  specific 
modes 
of 
consultation 
with 
indigenous 
peoples; 
(ii) 
at 
the 
local 
level, 
strengthening 
of 
grassroots 
organizations 
(auxiliary 
mayors 
and 
community 
directors) 
in 
such a 
manner 
that 
each 
community 
is 
enabled 
to 
represent 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
community 
in 
a 
positive 
way. 
In 
this 
sense, 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
obtain 
legal 
status 
(personaria 
juridica) 
for 
these 
organizations, 
and 
in 
all 
cases, 
even 
when 
legal 
status 
cannot 
be 
obtained, 
the 
community 
assemblies 
should 
be 
recognized 
and 
legalized 
as 
representative 
bodies 
of 
their 
respective 
communities; 
(iii) 
at 
the 
municipal 
level, 
and 
in 
each 
project  municipality, 
strengthening  (or 
established 
by 
linking 
existing 
entities) 
a 
local 
forum 
(Instancia Local) 
with 
participation 
from 
the 
municipal 
corporation, 
UTM 
(municipal 
technical 
unit 
- 
if 
it 
exists), 
local 
bodies 
of 
the 
civil 
society 
linked 
to 
“wise 
use 
of 
resources” 
(parcialidades, 
traditional 
religious 
fraternities, 
councils 
of 
elders, 
principales, 
shamans, 
and 
auxiliary 
mayors 
who 
represent 
indigenous 
villages 
and 
communities), 
producers groups, 
and 
NGOs 
with 
a 
local 
presence; 
and 
(iv) 
at 
the 
regional 
level, 
the 
project should promote 
intermunicipal 
forum 
and 
dialogues 
(e.g., 
through 
an 
Association 
of 
Mayors 
from 
within 
the 
project’s 
sphere 
of 
influence). 
This 
body 
should 
provide 
a representative 
to 
the 
project’s Regional 
Steering 
Committee. 
The 
central 
purpose 
of 
these 
two 
levels 
of 
permanent 
participation 
is 
to 
guarantee 
transparency and 
partnership 
in 
project 
implementation 
by 
consensus 
at 
the 
municipal 
as 
well 
as 
at 
the 
regional 
level. 
In 
all 
forums, 
bilingual 
communication 
should be provided. 
Intercultural 
social 
communication. 
Indigenous  populations 
will 
be 
kept 
fully 
informed 
of 
project 
activities 
and 
be 
assured 
of 
opportunities 
to 
fully 
participate 
in 
the 
project 
in 
their 
own 
languages. 
This 
requires 
identifying 
the 
relevant 
actors, 
elaborating 
culturally 
appropriate 
didactic 
materials, 
and 
implementing 
a 
information 
campaign 
covering 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
project. 
Because 
this 
must 
be 
initiated 
at 
project 
start-up, 
the 
project 
preparation 
team 
has 
acquired 
additional 
preparation 
funds 
to 
design 
culturally 
appropriate  communications 
methods 
and 
media 
and 
to 
translate 
technical 
and 
institutional 
strengthening materials and extension methodologies 
into 
culturally 
appropriate 
forms 
in 
the 
regions 
main 
Mayan 
languages. 
This 
will 
include 
materials targeted 
specifically 
towards women. 
Institutional 
strengthening 
for 
sustainable 
production 
and 
the 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources. 
This 
addresses 
local 
interests  and 
demands 
and 
is 
based 
on 
local 
institutionality 
in 
such  a 
manner 
that 
it 
strengthens 
the 
involvement 
of 
communities 
in 
the 
tasks 
of 
conservation. 
This 
requires 
an 
effort 
to 
promote 
local participation 
in 
all 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
project. 
It 
is 
necessary 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
typology 
of 
producers 
and 
the 
typology 
of 
organizations, 
which 
are 
presented 
in 
the 
Social 
Assessment, 
because 
different 
activities 
must 
be 
designed 
for 
each 
of 
the 
different 
types. 
Rural 
participatory 
diagnostics 
and 
the 
development 
of 
local 
capacities, 
especially 
in 
the 
field 
of 
project administration 
and 
management, 
will 
be 
undertaken. 
Major 
importance 
will 
be 
given 
to 
strengthening 
local 
institutionalitv 
and 
revitalizing traditional 
organizations, 
because 
the 
processes 
of 
development and 
the 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
depends 
on 
them. 
At 
the 
municipal 
level, 
the 
governance structure 
of 
the project 
(e.g., 
Instancias 
Locales) 
will 
be 
structured 
to 
provide 
for 
strong 
representation 
by 
indigenous 
people 
and women. 
Meetings 
of 
the 
Instancias Locales 
Page  93
Page 
89 
will, 
to 
the 
extent 
possible, 
be 
bilingual 
in 
Spanish and the 
local 
Mayan 
dialect 
or 
language. Assistance 
will 
be 
provided 
to 
the 
Instancias  Locales, 
to 
the 
UTMs, 
and 
to 
the 
formation 
of 
an Association 
of 
Mayors 
should 
demand 
exist 
for 
the 
latter. 
To 
facilitate 
all 
of 
the 
above, 
the 
project 
will 
assist 
communities 
and  other 
beneficiary 
groups 
to 
acquire 
legal 
status. 
If 
possible, 
creation 
of 
a 
legal 
framework, 
based 
on 
existing 
legal 
standards 
to 
facilitate obtaining 
complete and 
explicit 
recognition 
of 
indigenous 
communities 
as 
entities 
with 
their 
own 
legal 
status, 
should 
be 
supported. 
Project 
training 
programs 
for municipal 
promoters and 
local 
leaders 
(as 
in 
the 
Instancias Locales) 
would 
include 
gender- 
sensitivity 
and gender- 
equity 
training. 
Such 
training 
would 
be 
incorporated 
into 
other 
project-financed 
training, 
as 
appropriate. 
At 
the 
national 
and 
regional 
levels, 
the 
project 
will 
improve 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
staff 
of 
GoG 
agencies 
participating 
in 
project  implementation 
to 
support 
locally-defined 
and  managed 
development  and 
conservation 
initiatives 
and 
to 
work 
with 
indigenous 
people and 
particularly 
with 
indigenous women. 
The 
NGOs, 
private 
firms, 
universities and 
other 
entities 
enrolled 
in 
the 
Registry 
of 
Qualified 
Service 
Providers 
(see 
Annex 
2) 
will 
also 
be 
provided 
with 
the 
same 
types 
of 
capacity-building. The project 
will 
encourage 
contracting 
of 
women 
and 
individuals 
with 
local 
language 
capability for 
positions 
as 
Promoters, 
PCU 
staff, and 
Grant 
Technical 
Unit 
(GTU) 
and 
Biodiversity 
Component 
Technical 
Unit 
(BCTU) 
staff. 
Women 
’s 
participation: 
The 
PCU 
Gender 
Coordinator 
and 
GTU 
will 
develop 
information 
and 
simple 
manuals and 
technical 
materials 
on 
business 
and 
investment 
opportunities, 
in 
response 
to 
demands and 
needs 
voiced 
by 
women. 
Institutional 
strengthening 
programs and 
projects 
will 
give 
special emphasis 
to 
developing 
and 
strengthening 
women’s 
groups  and  assisting 
them 
in 
preparing 
subprojects 
for 
grant 
financing 
as 
well 
as 
to 
women’s 
participation 
in 
other 
local 
organizations. 
The 
project 
preparation team 
has 
acquired 
additional 
funds 
to 
enhance 
the 
project’s 
ability to 
benefit women. 
Special 
studies 
will 
assess 
constraints 
to 
participation 
by 
women, 
Mayan 
groups  and 
other 
disadvantaged 
people  and 
identify 
corrective 
actions 
to 
facilitate 
their 
inclusion 
and 
participation. 
Conservation 
of 
community 
biodiversiq. 
As 
part 
of 
Component 
2 
of 
the project, 
priority 
will 
be 
given 
to 
those 
communities 
in 
the 
seven 
sites 
selected 
for 
biodiversity 
conservation. 
Activities 
related 
to 
the 
conservation 
of 
biodiversity 
in 
indigenous communities 
include 
rural 
participatory 
evaluation, co-design 
of 
management plans, and 
regularization 
of 
boundaries. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
community 
conservation 
strategy, 
priority 
also 
will 
be 
given 
to 
activities 
related 
to 
the 
payment 
of 
environmental 
services. 
The project 
would work 
through traditional 
organizations and institutions, 
to 
the 
extent 
possible. 
It 
would 
seek 
to 
strengthen 
(at 
least 
to 
respect) 
existing 
and 
traditional 
tenure 
and 
resources management 
systems, 
and 
would 
disseminate 
appropriate indigenous 
knowledge 
and resource management 
practices. 
Implementation 
Schedule: 
Because 
long-term 
sustainability 
is 
a 
central 
goal, 
the 
project 
should 
take 
into 
account 
the 
seasonal 
schedules 
(including migratory 
work 
and 
peak 
labor times 
in 
agriculture 
cycles) 
in 
the 
planning 
of 
activities. 
A 
typology 
of 
local 
institutions 
has 
been 
constructed 
(CODERSA 
2000), 
and 
project activities 
(including institutional 
strengthening 
as 
well 
as 
subproject 
technical 
innovations) 
are 
designed 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the levels 
of 
capacity 
and 
the 
decision-making frameworks 
and 
tiineframes 
used 
in 
indigenous organizations. 
Monitoring 
and 
Evaluation: 
As 
described 
in 
Annex 
2, 
project 
monitoring 
and 
evaluation 
systems 
would 
provide 
routine, 
detailed 
information 
on 
a 
series 
of 
indicators 
of 
indigenous 
peoples’ 
and women’s 
participation 
and 
benefit 
from 
project 
activities. 
If 
participation 
or 
benefit 
falls 
significantly 
below 
targets, 
the Project 
Annual 
Reviews 
would 
recommend 
corrective 
actions. 
Indigenous 
peoples 
will 
participate 
in 
the 
design 
of indicators 
and 
in 
impact monitoring. 
Cost 
Estimates 
and 
Financing 
Plan: 
Because 
the 
Project 
is 
itself 
an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan, 
the 
costs 
and 
financing 
plan 
of 
the 
activities 
directed towards indigenous 
peoples 
are 
equivalent 
to 
the 
costs 
and 
financing 
of 
the 
project.

Guatemala 
Western 
Altiplano 
Natural 
Resources 
Management 
Project 
Environmental 
Analysis and 
Environmental 
Management 
Plan 
The  Guatemala 
Western 
Altiplano  Natural 
Resources Management 
Project 
seeks 
to 
achieve 
a 
number 
of 
complementary objectives, 
including: 
(i) 
addressing 
rural 
poverty 
in 
its 
region 
of 
highest 
incidence, 
the 
western 
highlands (Altiplano); 
and 
(ii) 
addressing and redressing 
the 
processes 
which 
have 
led 
and 
continue 
to 
lead 
to 
the 
degradation 
and 
decline 
in 
viability 
of 
the 
natural 
resource 
base. 
This 
is 
the 
resource 
base 
upon 
which 
rural 
livelihoods 
depend 
(e.g., 
agricultural 
land/soils, 
water, pastures, forests, 
biodiversity, fuelwood) 
and 
which 
also 
provides 
essential 
raw 
materials 
(e.g., 
lumber, 
non-timber 
forest 
products) 
and 
local 
environmental 
services 
(e.g., 
watershed 
protection, 
slope 
stabilization, 
flood 
control,  and 
spiritual 
and 
recreational 
values) 
along 
with 
global 
environmental 
services  and  values 
(e.g., 
sequestration 
of 
carbon, 
retention 
of 
clear 
water 
sources, 
globally 
important biodiversity, 
etc.). 
Guatemala’s 
Western 
Altiplano 
retains 
the 
country’s  highest 
density 
of 
rural 
population 
within 
a mountainous 
region 
containing 
some 
of 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
biological 
endemism 
and 
relict 
biodiversity 
and 
agro- 
biodiversity 
in 
Central America. 
The 
region 
was 
once 
densely 
forested 
with 
pine 
and 
broadleaf 
forests, 
most of 
which 
have been cleared 
for 
small-farm 
agriculture 
and grazing, 
exposing 
steep 
slopes 
to 
the 
dangers 
of 
erosion 
and 
slumping. 
Agricultural 
practices 
are 
largely 
traditional 
and 
of 
low 
productivity 
and 
diversity, 
with 
access 
to 
adequate land, 
markets 
for 
products, 
financing 
for 
inputs, 
and 
improvements 
in 
technology 
and 
knowledge being 
some 
of 
the 
main 
constraints. 
Rapidly 
expanding 
population 
in 
the 
region 
and 
growing 
rural 
impoverishment 
do 
not 
promise 
much 
relief 
for 
the 
natural 
resource 
base, 
and ways 
to 
preempt 
the 
total 
collapse 
of 
the natural 
systems 
need 
urgently 
to 
be 
experimented 
with 
and 
promoted. 
The 
project 
proposes 
to 
achieve 
a 
measurable 
improvement 
in 
the 
management 
of 
these 
natural 
resources 
providing 
incentives 
for local 
natural 
resources 
users 
to 
change 
from 
unsustainable 
to 
more 
sustainable 
natural 
resources 
uses 
and 
management practices. 
It 
will 
do 
so 
by 
linking 
the 
provision 
of 
financing 
for 
improved 
local 
environmental 
planning, 
agricultural productivity, 
diversification 
and 
market 
development 
to 
improved 
land 
and 
resource 
conservation. The 
project 
will 
also 
finance 
the 
identification 
and 
protection 
of 
high-value 
biodiversity 
within 
existing 
and 
new 
protected 
areas 
in 
the 
region, 
and 
the 
strengthening 
and 
improving 
the capacity 
of 
local, 
regional and national institutions 
in 
the 
protection 
and 
stewardship 
of 
these 
protected 
areas 
and 
their 
biological 
contents 
and 
values. 
In 
addition, 
the 
project 
will 
provide 
the 
financial 
resources 
and expertise 
to 
help 
Guatemala 
establish 
a 
system 
of 
valuing 
and 
marketing 
(locally, 
regionally, 
nationally 
and  internationally) 
the 
environmental 
services 
provided 
by 
well-managed 
ecosystems 
in 
the 
region. 
(see 
Annex 
2 
for 
details). 
Environmental 
Issues 
within 
the 
Project  Area: 
During 
project 
preparation, 
the 
GoG 
prepared 
an 
Environmental 
Issues 
report 
for 
the 
region 
(Analisis 
Ambiental General 
del 
Altiplano 
Occidental 
de 
Guatemala 
y 
del Proyecto 
MIRNA), 
a copy 
of 
which 
is 
included 
in 
the 
project files. 
The 
report 
lists 
the 
main 
interrelated 
environmental 
issues 
and challenges 
in 
the 
region, 
inter 
alia, 
land 
tenure 
and 
rights, 
soil 
erosion, 
forest 
cover 
losses, 
water 
availability 
and contamination, 
solid 
wastes, 
and 
pollution), 
and recommends. measures 
to 
address 
these 
within 
the 
project. 
The 
main 
challenges 
are 
summarized 
below: 
High 
population 
density 
with 
the 
region, 
concentrating 
some 
35% 
of 
the 
national population 
on 
some 
18% 
of 
the 
land 
which 
is 
poorly/inequitably 
distributed 
and 
much 
of 
which 
is 
held 
in 
small 
(and 
often 
agriculturally 
non-viable) 
parcels 
called 
miniJicndios. 
This 
causes 
constant pressure 
upon 
the 
land 
and other 
natural 
resources. 
It 
is 
the 
region 
within 
which violent conflict 
has 
raged 
over 
some 
40 
years 
and 
to 
which 
many 
formerly 
displaced 
persons 
are 
returning, 
exacerbating the 
pressure 
on 
land 
as 
well 
as 
urban facilities 
and 
public 
resources. 
Some 
70% 
of 
the people 
returning 
since 
the 
war 
ended 
are 
settling 
in 
Huehuetenango 
and Quiche. 
Page  96
Page

Land 
tenure 
is 
a 
chronic 
source 
of 
conflict, 
as 
are 
use 
rights 
and 
access 
to 
natural 
resources. 
Most 
commonly, 
land 
is 
held 
in 
small 
farms 
and 
in 
communal 
and 
municipal 
forests. 
The 
lack 
of 
secure 
land 
titles 
for 
smallholders 
and 
stable tenure 
rights 
to 
communal 
land 
rights 
hamper 
efforts 
to 
improve 
natural 
resources 
stewardship 
and conservation. 
Small-scale 
agriculture 
on 
steep 
slopes 
in 
light 
and 
friable 
soils 
causes 
chronic erosion 
and 
slumping 
and 
calls 
for 
soils conservation 
and watershed 
protection 
measures. 
Expansion 
of 
agriculture 
and pasture  into 
ever 
more 
marginal 
lands 
threatens 
remaining 
forests  and 
exposes 
new land 
to 
degradation 
and 
erosion. 
Generalized 
misuse 
and 
overuse 
of 
agricultural 
chemical  inputs 
such 
as 
fertilizers, 
herbicides  and 
pesticides. 
These 
run 
off 
into 
the 
streams 
and 
river 
courses 
and 
cause 
local 
and 
downstream 
pollution, 
resulting 
in 
human health 
problems. 
The 
issue 
is 
becoming more 
and 
more 
acute 
as 
market-oriented 
vegetable 
gardening 
and 
farming 
becomes 
more 
widespread 
in 
the 
region. 
Lack 
of 
adequate 
disposal 
of 
solid 
and 
liquid 
wastes 
is 
seriously 
contaminating water 
sources 
with 
effects 
upon 
human 
health. 
Positive 
Environmental 
Impacts 
of 
the 
Project: 
Overall, 
the 
proposed 
project 
is 
an 
environmental 
project, 
with 
GEF 
investments 
oriented 
entirely 
to 
conservation 
of 
global 
biodiversity 
but 
also 
with 
IBRD 
and 
GoG 
resources targeted 
to 
realization 
of 
environmental 
goals. 
The 
entire 
project description 
can 
thus 
be 
referred 
to 
for 
a 
review 
of 
the 
expected 
positive environmental 
and 
social 
impacts 
of 
the project. 
We 
would 
highlight 
among 
these: 
0 
0 
0 
0 
Promotion 
of 
environmental 
services; 
0 
0 
Gender 
focus 
of 
project. 
Support 
for 
environmental 
and 
natural 
resources 
planning; 
Improvements 
in 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
management practices; 
Support 
for 
protected 
areas 
and 
biodiversity 
conservation; 
Promotion 
of 
natural 
resource management 
targeted 
to 
indigenous 
people; and 
Potential 
Adverse 
Environmental Impacts: 
As 
mentioned 
above, 
the 
project 
is 
designed 
to 
improve 
rural 
livelihoods through fostering 
sustainable 
environmentally 
friendly 
activities 
and 
through improved 
management 
and 
conservation 
of 
the 
natural 
resource 
base. 
As 
such, 
criteria 
and screening mechanisms 
will 
be 
set 
in 
place 
to 
select 
against 
activities 
and 
investments 
which 
may 
go counter 
to 
these 
aims. 
National 
Environmental 
Legislation: 
Under 
national 
legislation, 
all 
private 
and 
public 
works 
and 
projects 
must 
undergo 
an 
environmental 
assessment 
(EA) 
and  clearance 
in 
accordance 
with 
Article 
8 
of 
the 
corresponding 
Legislative 
Decrees 
(DL 
68-86 and amended 
by 
DL1-93 
- 
Proteccion 
y 
Mejoramiento del Medio 
Ambiente). 
Article 
8 also 
holds 
that 
the 
official 
who 
omits 
or 
overlooks 
the 
EA 
requirement 
will 
be 
personally 
held 
co-liable 
for 
noncompliance 
and 
will 
be 
fined. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
rules, 
Article 
20 
of 
the 
Protected 
Areas 
Law 
(Ley 
de 
Areas Protegidas, 
DL 
4-89 
and 
its 
subsequent 
amendments) regulates 
activities 
within 
protected 
areas 
(concessions; 
infrastructure; 
productive 
activities; 
tourism 
facilities), 
all 
of 
which 
are 
subject 
to 
an 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
(EM) 
and 
must 
be 
compatible 
with 
the 
respective 
area’s 
Management Plan. 
The 
EIA 
is 
submitted 
to 
CONAP 
by 
the proponent 
who, 
in 
turn, 
submits 
it 
(with 
an 
opinion) 
to 
the 
national 
environmental 
commission 
(CONAMA) 
for 
review 
and 
approval. 
In 
regard 
to 
management 
of 
natural 
forests 
within 
protected 
areas 
(depending 
on 
the 
management category 
of 
the 
area), 
CONAP 
calls 
for 
an 
EIA, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
management plan, 
for 
eventual 
review 
and 
approval 
by 
CONAMA. 
CONAP 
has 
its 
own 
forest 
management 
manual 
with 
clearly 
established 
rules, 
standards 
and 
Page  97
Page 
93 
procedures. 
By 
contrast, 
INAB, 
which 
is 
responsible 
for 
regulating 
and 
licensing 
the 
use 
and 
management 
of 
forests 
outside 
of 
protected 
areas, 
does 
not 
require 
EIAs 
to 
accompany 
forest 
management plans. 
All 
of 
the 
above 
notwithstanding,  most 
EIAs 
in 
Guatemala 
are 
largely 
pro-forma 
exercises, 
since 
the national 
environmental 
agencies 
(CONAMA; 
CONAP)  lack 
the  technical 
human 
resources  and 
capacity 
to 
verify 
compliance. 
This 
project 
has 
the 
potential 
to 
produce clear 
environmental 
standards 
and regulations 
for 
activities 
such 
as 
road 
construction, 
tourism facilities 
housing 
within 
protected 
areas. 
Environmental Review 
of 
Project 
Activities 
by 
Component: 
While 
all 
project  activities 
are 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
environmental 
quality, 
the 
productive 
and resource management subprojects 
to 
be financed 
within 
Component 
1 
are 
most 
subject 
to 
potential 
environmental 
damage. 
Component 
2 
will 
create 
new 
and 
strengthen 
existing 
protected 
areas 
and 
biodiversity, 
within 
the 
national 
regulations 
cited 
above. 
Component 
3 
is 
entirely 
environmentally positive. 
Component 
1 
(Sustainable 
Livelihoods) 
is 
designed 
to 
raise 
the 
environmental 
standards 
and 
quality, 
as 
well 
as 
productivity 
and 
efficiency, 
of 
natural 
resource-based 
activities 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
including 
improved 
agricultural 
production 
and  practices, 
improved  livestock 
management  practices, 
and 
improved 
forest 
management practices, 
as 
well 
as 
soils 
and water 
conservation 
practices, 
community 
and 
municipal 
natural 
forest 
and 
natural 
areas 
protection. 
Local 
planning 
and 
expert 
technical 
assistance 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
so 
that 
local 
project 
beneficiaries/proponents 
can and 
will 
prepare acceptable 
environment-enhancing 
subprojects. 
These 
subprojects 
will 
be 
prepared and 
submitted 
according 
to 
guidelines 
for 
financing 
and 
design 
criteria, 
including 
the 
environmental 
criteria, 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Project 
Operational 
Manual. 
Subprojects 
will 
be screened 
according 
to 
these 
criteria 
and, 
should environmental 
issues 
arise, 
they 
will 
be 
addressed 
within 
the 
subprojects’  design. Based 
upon 
the 
screening, 
subprojects 
will 
be 
required 
(and 
assisted) 
to 
include environmental 
mitigation 
measures, 
including 
plans 
to 
reduce 
or 
replace 
the 
use 
of 
toxic 
agricultural 
inputs; 
change 
or 
modify 
cultivation 
practices; 
change 
or 
modify 
grazing 
sites 
and practices; change 
or 
modify 
forest, 
soils 
and 
water 
uses; 
change 
or 
modify 
disposal practices 
for 
solid 
wastes; 
and/or 
change 
or 
modify 
the 
degree 
and nature 
of 
forest 
exploitation. 
These 
mitigation 
plans 
for 
the 
subprojects 
will 
be 
reviewed 
first 
by 
the 
local 
technical 
promoter, 
then 
by 
the 
local 
review 
committee 
(Instancia Local) 
before 
being 
submitted 
to 
the 
PCU 
for 
higher 
level 
technical 
feasibility 
and 
environmental 
review 
and approval. 
No 
subproject 
financing 
will 
be 
approved 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
highly 
toxic 
agricultural 
inputs, 
clearing 
of 
forested 
land, 
inappropriate 
(e.g., 
clear 
cut 
felling) 
and excessive 
(with 
degrading 
results) 
exploitation 
of 
forests 
or 
which 
would 
lead 
to 
contamination 
of 
water 
courses 
and/or 
inappropriate disposal 
of 
solid 
and 
liquid 
wastes 
(as 
from 
coffee 
processing 
plants). 
The 
client-prepared 
environmental 
analysis 
proffers 
lists 
of 
the 
kinds 
of 
problems 
which 
might 
be confronted 
and recommends 
appropriate 
mitigating 
measures 
to 
be applied 
in 
the 
project, 
and 
included 
in 
the Project Operational 
Manual. 
Component 
2 
(Biodiversity 
Conservation) 
is 
designed 
to 
identify 
and 
put 
under 
some 
form 
of 
protection 
high 
value 
biodiversity 
in 
the project 
area. 
It 
will 
finance the 
improved 
management 
of 
existing 
protected 
areas 
within 
the 
National 
System 
of 
Protected 
Areas 
(SIGAP) 
and 
establish 
new 
ones. 
It 
will 
strengthen 
CONAP’s 
capacity 
at 
the 
central, 
regional 
and 
local 
levels 
to 
fulfill 
its 
mandate. 
Installation 
of 
new 
protected 
areas 
will 
be 
done 
in 
accord 
with 
current environmental legislation 
and regulations; 
this 
will 
not 
include 
resettlement 
of 
people 
(see 
section 
below 
on 
Involuntary 
Resettlement). 
Support 
for 
productive activities 
by 
people 
within 
and 
around 
the 
protected 
areas 
will 
be 
subject 
to 
the 
same 
rules 
established 
for 
Component 
1 
for 
subprojects, 
but 
will 
be more 
stringently 
supervised 
and 
monitored 
by 
CONAP 
and 
local 
community 
and 
municipal 
groups and 
entities. 
Environmental 
education and dissemination 
of 
environmental 
information 
will 
be 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
and 
a special 
effort 
and 
investment 
is 
being 
made 
to 
make 
such 
information 
available 
in 
culturally 
appropriate 
forms 
and 
local 
indigenous 
languages. 
The  environmental 
education 
strategy 
will 
include 
mass 
media 
communications 
(in 
the 
national 
and 
local 
languages), 
community 
environmental 
programs 
to 
stimulate 
Page  98
Page 
94 
awareness 
and increase 
local 
knowledge 
about 
environmental 
issues, 
biodiversity 
and 
protected 
areas, 
as 
well 
as 
strengthen 
the environmental curriculum 
within 
the 
public 
school 
system, 
Compliance 
with 
World 
Bank 
Safeguard Policies: 
The 
project 
has 
been designed 
to 
fully 
comply 
with 
the 
spirit 
and 
letter 
of 
relevant 
World 
Bank 
Safeguard 
Policies, 
as 
summarized 
below. 
Environmental 
Assessment 
(OP 
4.01). 
This 
project 
is 
classified 
as 
Category 
B, 
requiring 
an 
Environmental 
Analysis 
(EA) 
but 
not 
a full-scale 
Environmental 
Impact 
Assessment 
(EIA). 
In 
addition, 
a 
more 
detailed 
environmental 
analysis 
study, 
Analisis Ambiental 
del 
Altiplano 
Occidental 
de 
Guatemala 
y del 
Proyecto 
MIRNA 
(prepared 
by 
Consultores  para 
el 
Desarrollo 
Rural 
Sostenible 
- 
CODERSA) 
was 
submitted 
to 
the 
Bank 
in 
October, 
2000. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
Bank’s 
Information 
Disclosure 
Policy 
(BP 
17.50), 
copies 
of 
this 
report 
(in 
Spanish) 
are 
available 
for 
public 
viewing 
at 
the 
PCU 
office 
in 
Guatemala 
City 
(13 
Calle 
3-40, 
Edificio 
Atlantis, 
Nivel 
14, 
Zona 
10, 
Guatemala) 
and 
a 
copy 
is 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
project 
files. 
The 
key 
findings 
and 
useful 
recommendations 
from 
this 
report 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
design 
and 
summarized 
in 
this 
Annex. 
Consultation 
on 
the 
project 
has 
taken place 
at 
many 
levels 
and 
times 
throughout 
the preparation 
pro~ess.~ 
In 
addition, 
a 
full-fledged 
Social 
Assessment 
was 
carried out 
over 
the 
six 
departments 
of 
the western 
Atliplano 
and 
a 
subsequent 
stakeholder 
(mayors, 
auxiliary 
mayors, 
community 
representatives,  and 
local-level 
NGOs 
representatives) 
consultation 
held 
in 
Quetzaltenango (September 
2000) 
validated 
the 
results 
of 
the 
study 
and 
provided 
additional 
opportunities 
for 
consultation. 
A 
three-day 
national 
stakeholders 
workshop 
was 
held 
in 
the 
city 
of Antigua 
in 
September 
2000. 
Additional 
stakeholder 
consultations 
were 
held 
in 
San 
Marcos, 
El 
Quiche, 
and Huehuetenango (November 
2000). 
Special 
consultations 
were 
held 
in 
regard 
to 
Component 
2 
concerning 
the 
biodiversity 
and 
parks 
management 
activities 
of 
the 
project 
(Panajachel: 
November 
2000). 
Suggestions and 
information 
garnered 
from 
these 
workshops 
and 
consultations, 
and especially 
those 
emerging 
from the 
Social 
Assessment, 
have been 
included 
in 
the 
project 
design. 
Additional 
studies 
(see 
project 
files) 
have 
yielded 
important information. 
The 
Policy 
and 
Institutional 
Analysis 
study 
is 
of 
particular 
significance, 
as 
it 
reveals 
that 
Guatemala 
has 
in 
balance  a 
very 
satisfactory 
set 
of 
policies 
in 
regard 
to 
natural 
resources 
management, 
while 
having 
almost 
no 
capacity 
to 
implement 
them. 
This 
provides 
a 
strong 
justification for 
the 
institutional 
strengthening 
activities 
proposed 
in 
the 
project. 
The 
subproject 
environmental 
screening 
measures 
and 
processes 
which 
will 
be  detailed 
in 
the  Project 
Operational 
Manual 
and 
implemented 
under 
the 
project 
for both 
Components 
1 
and 
2 
fully 
comply 
with 
the 
requirements of 
OP 
4.01 
for 
the 
minor 
impacts that 
might 
be 
expected 
under 
this 
project. 
Natural  Habitat 
Policy 
(OP 
4.04). 
The  project  (through 
its 
GEF-financed 
Component 
2) 
is 
designed 
to 
maximize 
protection 
of 
existing 
remaining 
natural 
habitats 
and 
increase 
the 
amount and 
representativity 
of 
all 
such 
habitats 
within 
the 
national 
protected 
areas 
system 
(SIGAP). 
Component 
1, 
where 
rural 
sustainable 
livelihoods 
will 
be 
enhanced,  has 
criteria 
which 
strictly 
prohibit 
project 
financing 
from 
encouraging further 
incursions 
into 
and 
conversion 
of 
natural 
habitats, 
including 
forests, 
upland 
meadows  and 
dry 
forests  and 
wetlands. 
Checklists 
and  screening  mechanisms 
governing 
the 
selection 
of 
demand-driven 
community 
subprojects 
will 
filter out 
any 
proposals 
that 
could 
be 
harmful 
to 
such 
natural 
habitats. 
Community-managed 
forests 
and 
private 
conservation 
efforts 
will 
be 
encouraged and supported, 
financially 
and 
with 
expert technical 
assistance 
and 
information. 
Information on 
all 
the 
relict 
natural 
habitats 
within 
the western 
Altiplano 
will 
be 
generated, 
stored 
within 
the 
monitoring 
data 
base 
(GIS) 
and 
divulged 
through 
the 
environmental 
information 
and 
public 
education 
programs 
(in 
local 
indigenous 
languages and dialects, 
wherever 
possible). 
Forestry 
(OP 
4.36). 
The 
project 
will 
adhere 
to 
the 
spirit 
and 
letter 
of 
the 
prescriptions contained 
within 
the 
Bank’s 
new 
policy, insofar 
as 
it 
will: 
(i) 
seek 
above 
all 
to 
stimulate concern 
for  and 
support forest 
management 
processes 
and practices 
which would 
retain 
as 
much 
natural 
forest 
as 
is 
possible 
in 
areas 
where 
such forests 
still 
exist 
and 
are 
viable; 
(ii) 
seek 
to 
improve 
the 
environmental 
aspects 
and 
reduce waste 
and 
unsustainable practices 
within 
current 
forest  use 
and 
management practices; 
(iii) 
stimulate 
the 
revegetation 
of 
degraded 
lands 
and 
watersheds 
with 
natural 
and 
planted 
forests, 
wherever 
conditions 
allow 
for 
this 
to 
occur 
in 
a sustainable and

efficient 
manner; 
(iv) 
monitor 
all 
existing 
forest 
cover 
within 
the 
project 
area 
(baseline) 
and 
any 
future 
changes 
in 
this 
cover, 
promptly 
addressing 
the incentives 
and 
causes 
which 
lead 
to 
forest 
conversion 
and degradation; 
v) 
work 
with 
municipal 
governments and 
communities 
in 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
existing 
and encouraging 
expansion 
of 
forests, 
wherever 
such 
expansion 
is 
viable 
and sustainable 
(e.g., 
for 
the 
generation 
of 
chargeable 
environmental 
services); 
and 
vi) 
protect 
samples 
of 
rare and threatened 
forest types 
within 
protected 
areas 
and 
parks 
and 
in 
general 
address 
all 
manner 
of 
threats 
to 
existing 
forests 
(fire, 
poor 
grazing 
practices, unsustainable 
extraction 
of 
forest 
materials) 
through  improved 
management 
capacity 
building 
at 
the 
regional 
(NAB), 
inunicipal 
and 
community 
levels. 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
extraction 
of 
forest-based 
products 
(including 
timber, 
stakes, 
firewood, 
forest trash 
used 
as 
farm 
fertilizer, 
medicinal 
plants, 
etc.), 
the 
project 
will 
promote 
sustainable 
practices 
through financing 
community 
forest  management  plans, 
provide 
communities 
with 
forestry  specialized 
technical 
assistance, 
and 
support 
traditional 
management 
approaches 
which 
have 
shown 
to 
retain viable 
forest 
stands 
while allowing 
for 
low- 
intensity 
use 
of 
the 
forests. 
Pest 
Management 
(OP 
4.09). 
The 
project 
does 
trigger 
this 
Bank 
OP, 
in 
that 
almost 
all 
commercial 
farmers and 
gardeners 
in 
the 
project 
area 
use 
chemical 
inputs, 
such 
as 
chemical 
fertilizers 
and 
purchased 
pest 
and 
weed 
controls 
to 
produce 
vegetables, 
coffee, 
and 
other 
products 
for  local 
and 
regional 
(and  occasional  export) 
markets. 
The 
incidence 
of 
malpractice 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
application 
of 
these 
inputs 
is 
very 
high. 
The 
project’s 
aim 
is 
to 
raise 
agricultural 
productivity 
within 
the 
project 
area 
while 
also 
substituting 
for 
natural 
resources-degrading 
practices and 
reversing 
their 
effects (erosion, contamination, 
mining 
of 
fertility, 
and replacement 
of 
forest 
with 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
production). 
This 
process 
will 
take 
time 
and 
investments 
in 
public 
environmental 
education. 
Community 
subprojects 
with 
be 
screened 
for 
environmental compliance 
and  farmers 
trained 
in 
appropriate  applications 
of 
chemicals 
as 
needed. 
Thus, 
the 
project 
is 
expected 
to 
contribute 
to 
an 
overall 
reduction 
in 
the 
volume 
and nature 
(toxicity) 
of 
the 
chemical 
inputs, 
and do 
so 
gradually 
by 
substituting 
toxic 
substances 
for 
less 
toxic 
ones, 
large 
and 
inappropriate  applications 
for 
more 
appropriate 
quantities, 
and 
generally 
promote 
sustainable practices 
(e.g., 
integrated 
pest 
management) 
over 
environmentally 
unsustainable 
practices. 
In 
addition, 
no 
procurement 
of 
agrochemicals 
within 
the 
WHO 
Class 
1 
or 
2 
list 
would 
be 
allowed 
and, 
where 
agrochemical 
usage 
is 
an 
issue, 
all 
relevant 
subprojects 
will 
be 
required 
to 
include 
such elements 
as 
soils 
testing 
to 
reduce 
over-fertilization, 
training 
on 
appropriate 
use 
and storage and 
disposal 
of 
agrochemicals and 
containers, 
cleaning 
of 
equipment and personnel 
precautions 
to 
be 
taken. 
Strong 
gains 
will 
be 
made 
in 
these 
objectives 
through 
the 
environmental 
education 
and 
information 
programs, 
the 
local-level 
extension  and 
advisory 
services. 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
(OD 
4.20). 
Some 
90-95% 
of 
rural 
people 
in 
the 
project 
area 
belong 
to 
one 
or 
another 
Mayan 
indigenous ethnic 
subgroup. 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
highlighted 
this 
fact 
and 
made 
it 
quite 
clear 
that 
the project 
itself 
could 
thus 
be 
regarded 
as 
an 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Project. 
However, 
to 
further 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
OD 
4.20, 
the Project team 
has 
drafted 
a stand-alone 
IPDP 
with 
a 
number 
of 
measures 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
project 
will 
work 
within 
traditional 
Mayan 
cultural 
and 
natural 
resources 
and 
land 
use 
practices 
to 
achieve 
improvements 
in 
income 
and 
in 
natural 
resource 
conservation. 
Cultural 
Property 
(OPN 
11.03 and draft 
OP 
4.11). 
During 
preparation, 
the 
project contributed 
to 
financing 
a 
series 
of 
workshops 
in 
the project 
area 
on 
indigenous (Mayan) 
natural 
resources 
planning 
and 
management 
practices. 
The 
results 
of 
these 
workshops, 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
and 
the 
close 
participation 
of 
the 
indigenous 
Plan 
de 
Accidn 
Forestal 
Maya 
(PAF-Maya) 
in 
the 
project 
preparation 
process, 
have 
been 
drawn 
into 
the 
project 
design 
and 
are 
reflected 
in 
the 
project 
delivery 
and 
management 
structure 
whereby 
decisions 
and 
proposals are 
generated and decided 
upon 
at 
the 
local 
level 
and 
with 
the 
full 
participation 
of 
local 
village 
and 
community 
authorities and 
representatives, 
including 
the 
women. 
(See 
Annex 
1 
1). 
Involuntary 
Resettlement 
(OD 
4.30  and  draft 
OP 
4.12). 
The 
project 
would  not 
support  any 
involuntary 
relocation 
of 
people 
as 
defined 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.30 and 
the 
Draft 
OP 
4.12 
paragraph 
2A. 
Nevertheless,  a 
Process 
Framework 
has 
been 
prepared 
which 
summarizes 
current 
GoG 
legal  provisions 
and 
instruments 
regarding 
rights 
of 
populations 
in 
and 
around protected 
areas. 
The 
Process 
Framework 
also 
provides 
guidelines

and 
outlines 
means (such 
as 
extra 
assistance 
in 
preparation 
of 
proposals and 
access 
to 
subproject 
funds) 
for 
addressing 
potential 
adverse 
economic  impacts 
that 
might 
result 
from 
project-supported 
implementation 
of 
existing 
and 
new 
collaboratively 
designed 
management 
plans 
that 
include restriction 
of

Guatemala 
Western 
Altiplano 
Natural 
Resources 
Management 
Project 
Social 
Assessment 
This 
document 
summarizes 
the 
main 
findings 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
carried 
out 
during 
project 
preparation. 
Because 
some 
90-95% 
of 
the 
population 
of 
the 
project 
target 
area 
is 
indigenous, 
the 
project 
is 
designed 
as 
an Indigenous 
Peoples 
Development 
Plan 
as 
defined 
by 
the 
policies 
and 
operational directives 
of 
the 
World 
Bank. 
Nevertheless, a 
separate 
IPDP 
was 
prepared 
(see 
Annex 
11) 
along 
with 
a Gender 
Participation 
Plan 
to 
support 
the 
involvement 
of 
women, 
Mayans 
and 
ladino 
people 
in 
the 
project 
area 
(see 
project 
files). 
This 
Social 
Assessment 
had 
the 
following 
objectives: 
(a) 
evaluate 
the 
existing 
patterns 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
land 
ownership, 
management, 
access, 
and 
use 
practiced 
by 
different  ethnic 
groups 
and 
in 
different 
agro- 
ecological 
regions  of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano; 
(b) 
identify 
stakeholders  and 
beneficiaries 
using 
a 
gendered 
perspective and 
identify 
the 
most appropriate 
means 
by 
which 
they 
should 
be 
involved 
in 
project 
preparation, 
implementation 
and 
evaluation,  and 
to 
obtain 
their 
inputs 
for 
project 
scope 
and 
design; 
(c) 
identify 
potentially 
negative impacts 
of 
proposed 
activities 
on 
vulnerable  groups 
in 
the 
population 
including 
indigenous 
people, 
low-income 
producers, and 
women 
and 
to 
design 
measures 
to 
prevent 
or 
mitigate 
these 
impacts; and 
(d) 
identify 
opportunities 
to 
build 
the 
capacity 
of 
municipal 
governments, 
Mayan 
indigenous producers’  organizations 
and 
NGOs. 
Methodology: 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
consisted 
of: 
(a) 
an analysis 
of 
stakeholders 
and 
potential 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
project 
area 
engaged 
in 
agriculture, 
natural 
resources  management 
(mainly  communal 
forests) 
and 
environmental 
protection; 
(b) 
regional 
consultations,  workshops,  and 
focus group meetings 
with 
stakeholders 
and 
potential 
beneficiaries 
in 
the 
project 
area 
carried  out 
by 
a 
multidisciplinary 
team 
which 
included 
internationally 
eminent 
professionals, 
national 
experts, 
and 
local community 
social  and 
environmental 
field 
workers; 
(c) 
extensive 
interviews 
of 
municipal 
government 
representatives, 
community 
leaders 
and 
local 
NGOs; 
(d) 
extensive 
analysis 
of 
secondary 
literature 
on 
the 
social 
impacts 
of 
the 
legal  and 
regulatory framework 
including 
land 
tenure 
issues; 
(e) 
meetings 
held 
with 
national 
and 
local 
Mayan 
organizations 
and 
with 
representatives 
of 
non-indigenous 
communities 
and 
municipal 
leaders; 
and 
(f) 
specific 
legal 
analysis 
related 
to 
resettlement 
issues 
in 
regard 
to 
residents 
in 
and 
around protected 
areas. 
The 
initial 
step 
was 
to 
construct 
a socio-ethnographic 
matrix 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
selecting 
an adequate sample 
of 
communities. 
The 
communities 
exemplify 
the 
full 
range 
of 
ecological, 
socio-cultural and 
legal 
factors  and 
processes 
affecting 
natural 
resource management and 
productive activities 
in 
the 
Altiplano. 
The 
indicators 
used 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
socio-ethnographic 
matrix 
were 
based 
on 
ethnicity 
and  language 
(predominantly 
Mayan 
languages);  watersheds; 
administrative 
units; 
life 
zones 
and 
productive 
strategies 
used 
in 
the 
different 
life 
zones; 
land 
tenure; 
level 
of 
conflict; 
and 
relationship 
with 
the 
protected 
areas 
proposed 
by 
the 
SIGAP 
(Guatemalan 
Protected 
Area 
System). 
The 
socio-ethnographic 
team 
reviewed 
government, 
World 
Bank 
and 
academic 
studies, 
including 
ethnographic 
and 
statistical 
works. 
In 
addition,  special 
attention 
was 
given 
the 
World 
Bank’s 
study 
“Guatemala: 
Priorities 
in 
Natural 
Resource 
Management: 
Start-up 
Phase 
Literature 
Review/Diagnosis” 
(Warne, 
2/99). 
Based 
on 
the 
above, 
several survey 
instruments were 
designed 
together 
with 
World 
Bank 
staff: 
(a) 
Community 
Diagnostic 
Instrument: 
data 
were 
collected through group 
discussions 
and 
with 
focus 
groups whenever 
possible; 
(b) 
Natural 
Resources: 
group 
discussion 
methods 
were 
used 
to 
collect 
data 
on 
natural 
resources 
available 
to 
communities; 
(c) 
Local 
Authorities: 
a 
semi-structured 
interview 
guide 
was prepared 
for 
discussions 
with 
mayors 
or 
with 
municipal 
secretaries 
about 
natural 
resource 
use 
and 
conservation, 
common 
property 
management, 
etc.; 
(d) 
Organizations: 
a 
semi-structured 
interview 
guide 
was 
prepared 
to 
collect 
data 
from 
government 
organizations 
and 
non-government  organizations 
(NGOs) 
working 
in 
specific 
regions 
or 
municipalities; 
(e) 
Gender: 
open-ended 
and relevant 
questions 
were 
used 
within 
all 
other methods 
to 
focus 
on 
gender 
relations; and 
(f) 
Cross-cutting 
Studies: 
special 
studies 
were carried 
out 
on 
aspects 
of 
gender and 
institutional 
relations. 
(The 
Page  102
Page 
98 
experts 
in 
charge 
of 
these 
special 
studies 
also 
participated 
in 
the 
design 
and analysis 
of 
the 
studies 
mentioned 
above.) 
Results: 
The 
following 
summarize 
features 
critical 
to 
understanding 
the 
socio-cultural, 
economic 
and 
environmental 
dynamics 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
Historical 
Context: 
The 
basic socio-economic  structure 
of 
the 
region 
is 
the 
historical 
outcome 
of 
two 
critical 
periods: 
1) 
deliberate 
state 
policies 
of 
the 
Liberal 
Period 
(1 
870 
to 
1944), 
for 
the 
development 
of 
labor 
supply 
for 
agro-export 
plantations, 
which 
have 
had continuing 
impacts 
on 
agrarian structure 
and labor 
relations; and 
2) 
the 
armed 
internal 
conflict 
(1962 
to 
1996) 
during 
which 
the 
population 
of 
the 
region suffered 
harsh 
repression. 
Complexity 
and Diversity: 
The 
Western 
Altiplano 
is 
a 
region 
of mountainous 
relief, 
characterized 
in 
ecological 
terms 
by 
extremely 
fragile 
ecosystems, 
in 
social 
terms 
by 
being 
primarily 
indigenous 
(90-95% 
in 
the 
project 
target 
area; 
however, 
the 
degree 
to which 
people 
maintain 
Mayan 
customs, 
culture and 
identity 
varies),  densely 
populated 
with 
extremely small 
landholdings, 
and 
in 
economic 
terms 
by 
the  predominance 
of 
subsistence 
production. 
In 
general, 
there 
is 
a 
correlation 
between 
Mayan 
identity 
and 
deep 
poverty 
(93% 
of 
the 
entire 
indigenous 
population 
of 
Guatemala 
is 
classified 
as 
living 
in 
poverty). 
The 
Western 
Altiplano 
is 
a 
complex 
region 
because 
of 
its 
inter-ethnic 
relations, 
networks  of 
regional 
commerce, 
internal 
and 
external 
migratory 
processes, 
manifestations of 
local 
power 
and 
customary law, 
territorial 
conflicts, 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
globalization 
on acculturation 
and 
local 
economies. 
The 
linguistic 
and 
social-cultural 
diversity 
match 
the 
ecological 
and 
productive diversity: 
13 
Mayan 
languages 
(in 
addition 
to 
Spanish) 
are spoken 
by 
the 
people 
in 
the 
region. 
Despite 
the 
attempts 
of 
the 
state 
to 
homogenize and 
marginalize 
the 
Maya 
of 
the 
Altiplano,  local 
regions 
retain 
their 
cultural 
heterogeneity. 
Socio-cultural  identity: 
Socio-cultural 
identity 
is 
based 
on 
membership 
in 
a 
given 
local 
community, 
and 
the 
community 
is 
identified 
with 
a 
given municipality. 
There 
is 
a 
profound 
connection among 
people, 
community 
and 
territory 
(settlement, 
fields, 
woods and water 
sources). 
The 
Mayan 
cosmovision 
explicitly 
and 
closely 
links 
people 
with 
natural 
resources and 
provides 
an 
important 
contextual 
point 
of 
departure 
for work 
in 
natural 
resources management. 
In 
general, 
production 
and 
natural 
resource  management  are 
not 
seen 
as 
separate 
activities. Decisions 
tend 
to 
be 
made 
by 
consensus 
(in 
general 
assemblies), 
led 
by 
local 
authorities 
(often 
deputy 
mayors 
in 
law 
but 
elders 
in 
custom). 
Thus, 
the 
community 
is 
seen 
as 
the 
locus 
of 
organizational 
strength. 
Expressed 
Development 
Needs: 
Beyond 
needs 
for 
gainful 
employment, 
people 
are 
most 
concerned 
about 
growing 
water 
shortages. 
There 
is 
also 
concern 
about 
forests 
that 
supply 
firewood, 
timber, 
water 
supply, 
etc. 
Rupture 
of 
the 
Social 
Fabric: 
Three 
decades 
of 
violence 
and tactics designed 
to 
weaken 
local 
leadership 
and 
social and 
productive 
institutional 
structures 
and 
create 
mistrust 
within 
communities 
have 
severely 
stressed 
the 
social 
fabric 
of 
the 
communities 
that 
are 
central 
to 
Western 
Altiplano rural 
life. 
The 
current 
generation can 
count 
on 
far 
fewer 
traditional 
resources 
than 
its 
predecessors. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
communities 
and 
local formal 
and 
non-formal  institutions 
remain 
the 
central 
axle 
of 
decision-making, 
development, 
and 
conservation 
for 
rural 
people, 
These 
factors 
combine 
to 
make 
active 
participation 
and 
community-driven 
development 
the 
key 
to 
local 
development. 
Importance 
of 
Community-driven 
Development: 
Institutionalized  discrimination 
against 
the 
indigenous 
population, 
the 
recent violence,  and 
paternalistic development 
practices 
have 
left 
many 
indigenous 
people 
wary 
of 
top-down 
projects. 
To 
gain 
access 
to 
resources, 
local 
people 
tend 
to 
appease 
NGOs. 
This, 
along 
with 
mistrust 
of 
outsiders, 
NGOs, 
and 
the 
government 
and 
a 
history 
of 
failed 
projects 
make 
active 
participation 
and 
community-driven 
development yet 
more 
important. 
Recommendations: 
The 
ecological, 
agricultural, 
social, 
linguistic 
and 
cultural 
diversity 
of 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
make 
generalizations 
difficult 
and 
dangerously 
unproductive. 
Thus, 
the 
central recommendation 
of 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
is 
that 
addressing 
this 
complexity 
and 
diversity 
(which 
must 
be 
accepted 
as 
a 
given, 
not 
denied) 
requires 
a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
inclusiveness, 
participation, 
and 
flexible 
local 
processes 
in 
planning, 
community-driven 
development and 
project activity 
implementation and 
on 
strengthening 
local 
institutions 
in 
their 
ability 
to 
plan 
and manage 
conservation and development 
actions. 
(It 
should 
also 
be 
stated 
here 
that 
many 
Page  103
Page 
99 
of 
the 
recommendations  of  the  Social 
Assessment 
have 
been taken 
into 
account 
in 
Project 
design; 
some, 
however, 
fall 
beyond 
the 
purview 
of 
this 
project 
and 
will 
need 
to 
be 
referred 
to 
other 
more 
appropriate 
agencies.) 
Target 
Group: 
Predominantly Mayan 
Rural 
Population: 
The 
central 
participant/beneficiary 
groups 
would 
be 
poor 
rural men 
and 
women 
at 
the 
community, 
parcialidad, 
village,  and 
municipality 
levels 
who 
are 
organized 
around 
production 
and/or 
conservation 
goals. 
Given 
the 
social organization 
and 
institutional 
topography 
of 
the 
region, 
target 
groups 
would 
include 
women-headed 
families  (many 
of 
them 
war 
widows); 
existing 
community 
organizations, 
particularly 
traditional 
ones 
(rather 
than  committees 
artificially 
established 
to 
serve 
donor 
agencies), 
organized around 
agricultural production 
or 
natural 
resource management 
themes; 
and 
municipalities. 
In 
addition, 
small-scale 
cottage and 
rural 
industrial production 
units 
(e.g., 
textiles, 
artisan and 
craft 
goods, 
and 
furniture) 
should 
be 
targeted. 
Women: 
The 
decades 
of 
violence 
and 
outmigration 
of 
men 
to 
elsewhere 
in 
Guatemala 
and 
to 
the 
United 
States, 
have 
left 
behind 
a 
large 
number 
of 
women-headed  households. 
Though 
women 
play 
important  roles 
in 
agriculture,  commerce, 
firewood 
collection, 
forest 
stewardship and 
on 
some 
committees (although 
in 
some 
cases 
their 
participation 
may 
be 
a 
faqade 
to 
facilitate 
access 
to 
NGO 
benefits), 
there 
are 
few 
productive 
projects 
for 
women 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
proposed 
project 
must 
be 
proactive 
in 
facilitating 
women’s 
participation 
in 
the 
implementation 
and 
benefits 
of 
project 
activities. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
project 
must 
assure 
that 
provisions 
are 
made 
to 
prevent 
overburdening 
women’s 
work 
days, 
and alternatives 
and support 
(e.g., 
community 
childcare) 
must 
be 
made 
available 
to 
facilitate 
their 
participation. 
Culturally-Appropriate 
Communication:  Project 
information 
and 
activities  should  be 
in 
the 
local 
Mayan 
languages 
as 
well 
as 
Spanish, 
designed 
in 
culturally 
appropriate 
forms, 
and 
be 
easily 
accessible 
to 
non-literate 
people 
(as 
much 
as 
50% 
of 
the 
targeted 
population, 
predominantly 
women, 
is 
illiterate). 
Institutional 
strengthening, 
participation 
and 
local 
power: 
Given 
the 
immense 
socio-cultural 
variety 
in 
the 
project 
area, 
the 
lingering 
impacts 
of 
decades 
of 
violence, 
and 
the 
emphasis 
on 
community- 
and 
demand-driven 
development, 
the 
mechanisms 
through 
which 
the 
project 
will 
work 
must 
be 
specifically 
tailored 
to 
each 
municipal 
context 
and 
to 
the 
particularities 
of 
local 
counterparts, 
through 
participatory 
planning 
and 
implementation. 
In 
doing 
so, 
the Project 
will 
also 
be 
complying 
with 
OD 
4.20 
of 
the 
World 
Bank 
which 
calls 
for 
“the 
informed participation 
of 
indigenous 
peoples and 
communities 
in 
decision 
making 
throughout 
the 
planning, 
implementation 
and 
evaluation 
of 
a 
project” 
(paragraphs 
8 
and 
14). 
To 
assure 
that 
activities 
within 
the project 
are 
appropriate 
for 
the 
local 
context, 
are 
locally 
chosen (demand-driven),  and answer 
to 
locally-identified real 
needs, 
participatory 
diagnostics 
must 
be 
carried 
out.  These 
should 
analyze 
formal 
and 
informal 
institutional 
structures 
and 
relations 
(including  municipal 
government 
and 
community-level 
pro-development, 
resource 
management, 
spiritual, women’s 
and elders’ committees 
and 
associations) 
in 
each 
municipality 
supported 
by 
the 
project, 
They 
should result 
in 
selecting 
and 
constituting 
an 
appropriate 
Instancia 
Local 
(municipal-level 
forum 
for 
local 
natural 
resource and 
environmental planning 
and decision-making). 
This 
forum 
should be 
made 
up 
of 
representatives 
of 
the 
above 
groups, 
and should 
promote 
the 
identification 
and 
preparation and 
screen 
locally- 
generated subprojects 
for 
financing 
under the project. 
Representatives selected 
by 
communities 
and 
municipalities should 
be 
actively 
involved 
in 
working 
on 
project 
design, 
implementation 
and  evaluation 
(local 
evaluation  indicators 
should 
be 
employed). 
Where 
possible, 
consensual 
decisions 
(the 
traditional 
decision-making  method)  should 
be 
encouraged. 
(This 
requires 
that 
the 
project 
be 
willing 
to 
invest 
more time 
and resources 
in 
up-front planning 
than 
is 
usually the 
case.) 
Existing 
Local 
Institutions: 
Wherever  possible, 
the 
project 
should 
work 
with 
already 
existing  traditional 
organizations, 
rather 
than creating 
new 
ones. 
This 
is 
consistent 
with 
commitments 
made 
in 
the 
Peace 
Accord 
on 
Socio-economic 
Issues 
and 
the 
Agrarian 
Situation 
(ASESA 
No. 
37). 
It 
is 
also 
important 
because 
creating 
new 
organizations 
may 
divide 
a 
community 
to 
the 
detriment 
of 
unified 
local 
development 
and 
conservation 
efforts. 
For 
the 
success 
of 
project activities 
and 
long-term sustainability 
(stability 
of 
natural 
resource  management 
regimes 
and 
strengthening 
of 
local 
capacity 
to 
develop 
and implement 
new 
projects 
and acquire 
additional 
funding) 
and 
of 
positive social 
impacts, 
existing 
structures 
should 
be strengthened. 
These 
might 
include 
councils 
Page  104
Page 
100 
of 
elders, 
auxiliary 
mayors’ 
corporations, 
and 
local 
entities 
that 
manage 
natural 
resources 
as 
well 
as 
development 
forums  that  exist 
within 
the 
municipal 
code. 
Particularly 
in 
cases 
where  there  exists 
a  clear 
communal 
tradition 
of 
management 
of 
natural 
resources such 
as 
forests, 
water 
and 
land, 
the 
project 
should 
strengthen 
the 
local 
institutions 
responsible  and  create 
the 
necessary 
space 
to 
make 
possible 
increased 
community participation 
in 
municipal 
government. 
Associations 
of 
auxiliary 
mayors 
and other 
existing 
formal 
and 
informal 
authorities should 
be 
provided 
with 
assistance 
as 
well. 
Legal 
Status 
of 
Local 
Organizations: 
Since 
under 
current legislation, 
the 
indigenous 
community 
(as 
such) 
is 
not 
recognized 
in 
law, 
the 
project 
should 
assist 
beneficiary 
groups 
to 
obtain 
legal 
status 
Cpersonariajuridica). 
Legal 
status 
for 
indigenous  communities 
and 
rural 
organizations 
would 
facilitate 
the 
capture 
of 
funds, 
allow 
for 
signing 
of 
contracts, 
give 
access 
to 
a range 
of 
state 
and other 
resources, 
and, 
in 
general, 
increase 
capacity 
for 
self-management. 
Particular 
attention should 
be 
given 
to 
legalizing 
groups 
organized 
by 
women 
(in 
cooperation 
with 
Departmental 
Women’s 
Forums; also 
see 
ASESA 
No. 
33). 
Coordination:  The  project 
should 
assist 
in 
coordination 
across 
geographic 
boundaries, 
landscapes  and 
administrative 
(governmental) 
units 
to 
create 
synergies 
and 
enhance 
subproject impacts. 
It 
should 
help 
support 
the 
regional  Association 
of 
Mayors 
to 
facilitate 
information 
exchanges  and 
stimulate 
greater 
regional 
participation. 
Because 
the 
Project 
will 
operate 
within 
the 
boundaries 
of 
the Mesoamerican 
Biological 
Corridor 
(and 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
International 
Labor 
Organization’s 
Treaty 
169, 
article 
32), 
regional 
cooperation 
among 
the 
indigenous people should 
be 
fostered 
(with 
Mexico, 
for 
instance). 
The 
project 
should 
also ensure 
that 
it 
works 
with 
other 
development and 
conservation 
efforts 
in 
the 
region. Technical 
and support 
services 
should 
be 
provided 
by 
NGOs, 
private 
firms 
and others 
with 
compatible 
development philosophies and practices. 
Sustainable 
Livelihood 
Strategies: 
Since 
some 
95% 
of 
rural 
families 
in 
the 
region 
intensively 
farm 
plots 
of 
less 
then 
7 
ha 
and 
nearly 
half 
of 
those 
are 
less 
than 
0.7 
hectares 
(predominantly 
gardens 
of 
corn 
and 
beans), 
they 
have 
developed diverse 
survival 
strategies. 
These 
include 
permanent and 
seasonal 
migrant 
labor,  commerce, 
production 
of 
craft 
goods, 
cottage 
industries 
and 
small-scale 
factories  (textiles  and 
furniture), 
tourism,  and 
capture 
of 
remittances 
from 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
project  should 
support 
improved 
productivity 
and 
profitability 
of 
diversified 
strategies. 
Clean 
Technology 
Agriculture: 
Production 
and 
marketing 
of 
agricultural 
products 
should 
be 
supported 
through 
(i) 
rescuing and 
promoting 
those 
traditional 
agro-ecological 
systems 
of 
production 
which 
use 
organic 
inputs 
and 
which 
have the 
potential 
to 
be 
articulated 
with 
demands 
for 
certified 
products that 
are 
of 
increasing 
global 
importance; 
(ii) 
promoting 
improved 
clean 
production 
and 
transformation 
technologies; 
and 
(iii) 
local 
and 
regional 
marketing 
initiatives. 
Non-agriculturally 
based 
income 
generation: 
In 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
pressure 
on 
natural 
resources, 
the 
project 
should  also  support 
non-agriculturally 
based 
income  generation 
activities. 
Recommendations 
for 
types 
of 
products and 
businesses 
are 
detailed 
in 
the 
Social 
Assessment. 
Throughout, opportunities 
should be 
provided for 
organizing  and 
training 
women’s 
groups 
for 
specific 
work. 
These 
should 
take 
into 
account 
technical 
improvements, 
access 
to 
credit, 
small 
business 
management 
training 
and 
marketing 
of 
artesanry 
produced 
by 
women, 
and 
easing 
of 
women’s  current 
work 
loads. 
These 
should 
provide 
women 
with 
improved 
possibilities 
of 
competing 
in 
national 
and 
international 
markets 
with 
a 
variety 
of 
farm 
and 
off-farm 
products. 
Pilot 
projects 
for 
marketing 
organic 
coffee 
and other 
high-value 
crops 
should be 
fostered, 
while minimizing 
reliance 
on 
external 
intermediaries.  Mechanisms 
to 
value 
and 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
use 
of 
environmental 
services 
(in 
particular 
water 
consumed 
by 
agro-export 
companies 
and 
other 
plantations 
on 
Guatemala’s 
south 
coast) 
should 
be 
created. 
In 
addition, 
collective 
indigenous 
intellectual property (particularly 
those 
related 
to 
crops 
and 
medicinal 
plants) 
as 
an 
important part 
of 
the nation’s 
patrimony 
should 
be 
protected. 
Conservation 
and 
Use 
of 
Natural 
Resources: 
In 
the 
Western 
Altiplano, 
successful 
conservation 
efforts 
will 
have 
to 
be based 
on 
secure, 
clear 
and 
explicit 
local 
control, especially 
when 
involving 
indigenous 
communal 
lands. 
Local 
institutions 
that manage resource 
access 
must 
be 
central 
to 
project 
conservation 
activities. 
Page  105

Tenure: 
The 
Social 
Assessment 
recommends that, 
where 
feasible, 
the 
Project 
support 
regularization/legalization 
of 
communal 
lands 
(common 
property), 
including municipal 
lands, 
which 
have 
a 
clear 
community 
tenancy 
tradition 
(which 
is 
called 
for 
in 
OD 
4.20 
paragraph 15.c.: 
“... 
The 
[World] Bank 
will 
extend 
to 
the 
borrower 
the 
assessment 
and 
assistance 
needed 
to 
assure 
legal 
recognition 
of 
indigenous 
populations’ 
traditional land 
tenancy 
systems” 
and 
in 
clause 
IV-F-5 
of 
the 
Peace 
Accord 
on 
the 
Identity 
and 
Rights 
of 
Indigenous 
Peoples 
[ASIDPI]). 
Standardizing 
the 
titling 
and 
registering 
of 
communal 
lands 
should 
lessen 
incentives 
for 
privatizing 
natural 
resources, 
which 
removes 
land 
and 
its 
benefits 
from 
community 
control. 
Women-headed 
households 
will 
need 
special 
bilingual 
legal 
assistance 
to 
obtain legal 
title 
to 
the 
lands 
they farm. Deere and 
Le6n 
(1999) 
affirm 
that 
land 
ownership 
(including 
in 
those 
cases 
in 
which 
peasant 
women 
are 
not primarily 
agriculturists) 
has 
great 
importance 
for 
status 
and 
welfare, and becomes a 
platform 
for 
“empowerment.” 
Management 
of 
Resource 
Access 
ConJicts: 
Participatory 
mapping 
should 
be 
employed 
to 
define 
agreed-upon 
boundaries 
of 
multiple-use 
and conservation 
areas 
and boundaries 
between 
neighboring 
communities 
and 
to 
define current 
use 
of 
natural 
resources. 
This 
should 
be 
done 
in 
cooperation 
with 
PROTIERRA 
(a 
GoG 
agency 
for  cadastral 
work 
and 
registries). 
To 
resolve  land 
use, 
tenancy, 
natural 
resource 
and  socio-environmental 
conflicts, 
the 
good 
services 
of 
local 
institutions 
based 
on 
Mayan 
norms 
(making 
use 
of 
the 
existing 
wealth 
of 
indigenous 
common 
law) 
should 
be 
drawn 
upon, 
while 
maintaining 
contact 
with 
CONTIERRA 
(GoG 
agency 
for 
land 
conflict 
resolution). 
Because 
this 
approach 
would 
have 
legitimacy 
among 
the 
parties 
to 
a 
dispute, 
it 
would 
help 
assure 
compliance 
with 
agreements 
reached. 
Resettlement 
and 
Protected Areas: 
The 
current 
configuration 
of 
remaining 
areas 
of 
forests 
as 
well 
as 
water 
sources 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano 
correlate 
with 
many 
of 
the 
historical protective 
actions and 
areas 
belonging 
to 
indigenous  communities, 
rather 
than 
with 
state 
policy. 
Hence, 
not only 
should 
such 
traditional 
regimes 
be 
supported, 
but 
any 
involuntary 
resettlement 
or eviction 
of 
local 
populations 
will 
be 
strictly 
avoided. 
The 
norms 
established 
in 
the 
Bank’s 
OD 
4.30 
(which 
are 
more restrictive 
than 
CONAP’s resolution 
No. 
030-99 
on 
Policies 
for 
Human 
Settlements 
in 
Protected 
Areas 
or 
ASESA 
34.f-k 
and 
ASIDPI 
IV 
F6) 
should 
be 
strictly followed. 
Local 
conservation 
practices 
should 
be 
fostered and respected 
in 
delimiting 
conservation 
and 
protected 
areas. 
Community 
members 
should 
fully 
participate 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
management plans, 
which 
in 
turn 
will 
be 
established 
to 
include 
local 
priorities 
and  solutions 
(PAHAP 
115. 
and 
111: 
1 
1). 
The 
concept 
of 
“Community 
Management 
Entities” 
(UTM, 
PAHAP, 
Annex 
4) 
should 
be 
adapted 
to 
serve 
traditional 
Maya 
localities. 
This 
corresponds 
to 
ASIDPI 
IV-F-612, 
which 
stipulates 
that the government 
should 
“recognize  and 
guarantee 
the 
right 
of 
communities 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
use, 
administration 
and 
conservation 
of 
existing 
natural 
resources 
on 
their 
lands.” 
The project should 
support 
the 
state’s 
obligation 
to 
seek 
and “to 
obtain 
the favorable 
opinion 
of 
indigenous 
communities 
prior 
to 
carrying out 
any 
project 
involving 
use 
of 
natural 
resources” 
(ASIDPI 
IV-F-613) 
and 
“... 
to 
adopt, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
communities, 
the 
necessary means 
to 
protect 
and 
conserve 
the 
natural 
environment” 
(ASIDPI 
IV-F-614). 
Further 
Recommended 
Actions: 
In 
order 
to 
be 
best 
prepared 
for 
project 
implementation, 
the 
Social 
Assessment 
recommends 
that 
the 
following 
additional 
information 
be 
gathered 
and 
synthesized. 
The 
first 
two 
items 
have 
been 
completed, 
and 
the 
following 
three 
are 
well-advanced.

Develop 
a 
typology 
and 
profile 
of 
municipal 
corporations and 
their 
committees and 
of 
common 
local 
formal 
and 
informal  institutions. Provide 
a 
description 
of 
the 
range 
of 
levels 
of 
organization, 
capacity 
and 
legitimacy 
that 
each has 
within 
the 
community 
and 
the 
types 
of 
support 
that 
would 
enable 
it 
to 
better 
fulfill 
the 
roles 
expected 
of 
it 
by 
civil 
society.

Develop 
a 
typology 
and 
profile 
of 
producer 
groups 
in 
each 
municipality to 
help 
define 
work 
plans 
and 
programs 
for 
each 
target 
group, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
level 
of 
intervention 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
project. 
0 
Carry 
out 
a 
deeper 
study 
of 
the 
bases 
for 
household 
subsistence, 
as 
a great range 
of 
alternative options 
for 
“survival 
strategies” 
which 
may 
be 
observed 
in 
the 
Western 
Altiplano. 
This 
will 
help 
formulate 
plans 
for 
technical 
assistance 
and training, 
which 
can 
be 
an 
important 
aspect 
of 
supporting 
local 
development 
while 
reducing 
pressures 
on 
natural 
resources.

Carry out 
a 
more detailed 
study 
of 
gender 
aspects 
of 
local 
organizations, 
production 
systems, 
and 
resource 
management 
practices 
to 
more 
fully 
target 
project activities 
to 
women, men, and 
families.

Develop 
a 
detailed 
communications 
strategy and 
materials 
for 
culturally 
appropriate 
communication 
and 
education 
for 
all 
major 
language groups 
within 
the 
context 
of 
the 
project.
