REPORT AND RECOMMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT AND LOAN
TO THE MALAGASY REPUBLIC FOR A FORESTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit for the equivalent of $6.75 million and a proposed Loan
for the equivalent of $6.75 million to the Malagasy Republic to help finance
a forestry project. The credit would be on standard IDA terms. The loan,
which would be utilized after the credit, would have a term of 25 years,
including 10 years of grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECOTOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "'The Economic Development of
Madagascar:  Main Issues"   (Report No. 167a-MAG) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on July 15, 1974. Country data are attached as
Annex I.
3.        Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world, has a popula-
tion of nearly 8 million, with an average per capita income of about $140.
Its economy is dominated by the agricultural sector. In the 1960's agricul-
tural production only rose at the same rate as population and lagged behind
the growth in the domestic demand for foodstuffs. Agriculture supports
directly about 85 percent of the population and contributes approximately
one third of GDP. Recent fluctuations in GDP may be attributed in part to
changes in weather. In 1973, harvests were poor and real GDP fell sharply.
In 197h, there was a good harvest and a modest increase in real GDP is
forecast.
4.        The two main crops are rice, which is the staple food, and
coffee,which is the most important export.   Rice is grown on more than half
of the area under cultivation and accounts for about half of the country's
crop production by value. Nevertheless, Madagascar has increasingly imported
rice to make up a domestic deficit. The quantity of rice marketed in 1973
was well below the 1970-72 level, not only because of the poor harvest, but
also because a low producer price discouraged farmers from selling their
crop.  Consequently, shortages led to the import of an exceptional 124,000
tons of rice, equivalent to about 9 percent of annual consumption. In the
past year, to provide improved incentives to the farmers, the price of paddy
has been increased by nearly 90 percent. The producer prices of beef,
groundnuts, pepper and coffee have also been substantially raised. Rice
production in 1974 was about 15 percent higher than in 1973 and the quantities
of most other crops produced also increased.



5.        While the country is sparsely populated--?3 inhabitants per
square kilometer--there is great pressure on cultivable land in specific
regions. In these areas, people have standards of living close to
subsistence level; nutrition is deficient and child mortality is high.
A particular difficulty is the lack of an adequate inland transportation
network.  Despite the heavy irnvestments which took place in the last
decade, only one-third of the highway network is all-weather and only
3,000 kilometers of road are paved in a country where production centers
may be as far as 1,200 kilometers from the points of consumption.
6.        Manufacturing has made only a small contribution to overall
economic growth although it has expanded faster than GDP. It provides
employment for no more than 42,000 people or under 2 percent of the total
active population; it contributed about 12 percent of GDP in 1972. Produc-
tion is almost entirely devoted to consumer goods for domestic use. As
manufacturing expanded, the imports of non-food consumer goods declined as
a percentage of total merchandise imports from 42 percent in 1960 to 28
percent in 1972. However, the scope for further import substitution is
limited by the smallness of the monetized domestic market.   In addition,
this industrial growth has required high protection against competitive
imports and has resulted in a sharp increase in imports of raw materials
and intermediate products utilized for local processing.
7.        Between 1966 and 1971, real GDP per capita rose by only 1 percent
per annum. During this period Government policies did not sufficiently
support economic and social development. They favored urban consumers through
price controls on domestically produced commodities and they favored high
income groups through liberal imports of luxury goods. At the same time,
reliance on foreign technical assistance was substantial and recourse to
external borrowing was limited. This relative conservatism can be explained
in part by the inertia of a tradition-bound society, regional fragmentation
and ethnic diversity. It can also be partly explained by an institutional
framework inherited from the colonial period which did not favor rapid
development.
8.        In 1972, the Government of President Tsiranana was replaced by
a new Government led by General Ramanantsoa. The economic policies of the
present Government have been set out in a new National Development Plan
covering the period 1974 to 1977 published in May 1974. The Plan proposed
a target rate of growth of GDP of 3.2 percent per year, calling for an
investment program totaling $700 million over the four year period. The
Directorate of Planning is currently preparing a detailed public sector
investment program in conformity with the policies elaborated in the Plan.
The two most important objectives of the Government's development strategy
are clear. First, the rural people are to be much more closely involved
in the development process. To achieve this, regional and local government
is being reorganized using the traditional village councils or "fokonolonas".
The fokonolonas are being associated with the management of small scale
development projects, the marketing and processing of agricultural commodities
and the distribution of agricultural inputs, including credit. Second,
Malagasy nationals are to take control of the management of the economy.



- 3 -
Foreign executive staff in private enterprises, most of which are foreign-
owned and managed, are being replaced as far as possible by Malagasy, in
keeping with schedules agreed upon with the owners. To achieve the same
objective, the Government is gradually extending its control over
important sectors--namely banks, insurance companies, external trade,
domestic and external transport, energy and mines--by purchasing majority
interests in existing firms, and by establishing public corporations to
be run commercially.
9.        Uncertainties about economic policies associated with the change
in Government in 1972 adversely affected private investment. There was a
downturn in the economy in 1972 and 1973 which was reflected in lower public
savings and a decline in public investment. Consequently, total capital
formation amounted to only 13.2 percent of GDP in 1972 and 12.3 percent in
1973. There are indications of a small increase in total investment in
1974, mainly as a result of a rise in public capital formation.
10.       To further its aim of bringing the economy more fully under
Malagasy control, Madagascar left the Franc Zone in July 1973. This
withdrawal has been accompanied by the introduction of exchange control
regulations and the establishment of an autonomous central bank. Imports
of non-essential commodities have been curbed by licensing and an increase
in import taxes. In 1973, despite Madagascar's internal economic difficulties,
the overall balance of payments showed a surplus of about $10 million.
However, over the past twelve months, the cost of rice imports has approached
$50 million, and imports of oil products have cost about $15 million. These
and other factors are likely to result in an overall balance of payments
deficit in 1974. Net foreign exchange reserves currently account for about
three months of merchandise imports and are likely to decline further in ine
short term. The Government is actively considering ways to redress the
situation, including measures to restrain domestic consumption and to promote
investment and exports. Nevertheless, it is likely that there will be a
severe shortage of foreign exchange over the next two to three years.
11.       The long-term prospects of the balance of payments are favorable.
The country's export trade is already diversified. Coffee, cloves and
vanilla face inelastic demands on international markets, but they account
for only half of Madagascar's total merchandise exports. Investments and
policies favoring the production of meat, high quality rice, fish and sugar
should permit Madagascar to improve its export position. In addition, the
association with the European Communities should provide in the long run
markets for    industry more oriented towards exports. There is also some
potential for tourism.
12.       Disbursements on medium and long term official aid averaged about
S12 million in thie 1970-71 period and reached  $23 million in 1973. As a
result of concessionary external assisLtance and a 1972 agreement canceling
about 45 percent of debt owed to France, the current level of Madagascar's



indebtedness is relatively low. The external public debt disbursed and out-
standing at the end of 1973 was estimated at about $117 million, of which
the Bank Group's share was 33 percent. The service on public debt amounted
to   $11 million in 1973 or about 4.9 percent of export earnings, of which
the Bank Group's share was    S0.8 million.  In the next few years, the need
for foreign exchange will be greater than the imported component of the public
investment program.   It would therefore be appropriate for external assistance
to be used to finance a substantial share of local costs.
13.       If one assumes that about one-fifth of Madagascar's future borrowing
will be financed on soft (IDA-type) terms, three-fifths on IBRD-type terms and
the balance on commercial terms, the debt service ratio would remain below 1IJ
percent by 1980, but would rise steeplv thereafter, to reach close to 20 per-
cent by 1985.  This points to the need for most external assistance to continue
to, be provided on concessionary terms, although Madagascar is considered credit-
worthy for moderate amounts of Bank lending. Even with some increase in our
program, the Bank Croup's share in Madagascar's disbursed foreign debt is ex-
pectod to decline gradually over the next 10 years to reach about 25 percent
by 1985.  Over the same period, the Bank Group's share in Madagascar's debt
service is expected to increase somewhat but would not exceed 15 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       Madagascar has received eight IDA credits totaling $76.8 million
and four Bank loans totalling $25.8 million. About 64 percent of the total
lending has been for transport, 32 percent for agriculture and the balance
for education. There have been no IFC investments. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank Loans and IDA Credits as of October 31, 1974 and
notes on the execution of on-going projects. Project execution is generally
satisfactory, with three exceptions.   The Livestock Project (Loan 585-MAG)
has encountered major problems but remedial measures, agreed upon between the
Government and the Bank are being implemented. The Morondava Irrigation
Project (Credit 322-MAG) and the Third Highway Project (Loan 876-MAG and
Credit 351-MAG), both of which are covered in greater detail in Annex II,
are facing serious problems due to heavy increases in implementation costs.
15)       The emphasis in our lending for transport and agriculture conforms
to Madagascar's development requirements and objectives. Our program in trans-
port is geared to: (i) the development of the main road network; (ii) the
construction of penetration roads into promising agricultural areas: (iii) the
improvement of port facilities; and (iv) the strengthening of the railroad
which provides the most economic means of transportation in certain areas and
for certain commlodities. The Tamatave Port Project, currently in execution,
will soon provide an improved outlet for exports.    Roads financed by the Bank
and IDA in the central, northern and part of the western regions have helped
to increase all-weather land connections within the island. A secondary net-
work, however, is largely lacking and secondary roads in existence are in poor
physical condition; this hinders the development of potentially rich agricul-
tural areas. Under the Railway project, assistance is given to prepare a
program of secondary road improvement.



16.       In agriculture, Madagascar's development objective is to regain
self sufficiency in rice by expanding production, and to diversify and
increase production for export. The Bank is assisting the Government in
the implementation of this policy by two ongoing projects whose principal
production will be rice, while the recently approved livestock project will
increase beef exports.    Additional projects for agricultural
development are at various stages of preparation and should result in Bank
Group financing in the next three fiscal years. The Government is currently
preparing, with Bank assistance, a scheme to rehabilitate various irrigation
works that would enable Madagascar to expand rice production. Consideration
is being given to devising mechanisms whereby financial assistance could be
provided to local communities to finance small development projects. Project
preparation in agriculture, however, is hampered by a serious shortage of
expertise. The proposed project therefore includes funds that would enable
the Government to hire, as and when needed, individual experts to strengthen
its own services in this respect. In education, an important reform is under-
way, on the basis of which a project, suitable for Bank Group financing, may
materialize in FY 1976. Finally, a hydro-electric power project and a devel-
opment finance company project are also under preparation.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY SECTOR IN MADAGASCAR
17.       Agriculture is the most important sector in the economy of Madagascar.
It directly supports about 85 percent of the population, contributes about one-
third of GDP, and is the source of about 85 percent of foreign exchange earn-
ings. On-farm consumption absorbs about 60 percent of total agricultural pro-
duction. Basic food crops are rice, maize and manioc. The principal agricul-
tural exports are coffee, cloves, vanilla, pepper, beef, sugar and sisal.
Livestock production accounted for about 10 percent of total GDP in 1972,
and contributed about 11 percent of total exports.
lF.       There are five major agricultural production regions in the country:
the central highland, accounting for most of the irrigated rice grown; the
east coast, where the main products are coffee, cloves, pepper, vanilla and
bananas; the northern zone, which has a tropical climate, growing mainly cash
crops such as sugarcane, cocoa and spices; the middle west, where soil and
climate conditions are ideal for livestock development; and the west coast,
where the population is scarce and where food crops (maize, cassava) and
livestock are the main traditional activities. The high fertility of some
of the alluvial flood plains in this latter region has led to the development
of cotton and tobacco cultivation as well as to the production of hiigh qualiyv
rice for export.
19.        One of the main objectives of the Malagasy Government over the next
few years is the expansion of marketable production of agricultural commod-
ities in order both to satisfy the basic needs of the rural population and



to generate foreign exchange resources. Agricultural exports, including
exports of forestry products, will have a special significance in this
context, as alternative means of meeting the countryts growing foreign ex-
change requirements are limited.
20.        About a third of Madagascar's land area is covered with forests
consisting mainly of indigenous tropical hardwood and some pine and eucalyptus
plantations. About 12 million ha are state forests, a third of which has been
demarcated as Forest Reserve. However, most of the indigenous forests have
limited economic significance because of difficult access and low value of
the wood.
21.       The Government has initiated afforestation programs in various areas
where soils are inadequate for agriculture or livestock. The afforestation
programs are also expected to create employment opportunities and help control
Madagascar's serious erosion problem. By 1973 about 65,000 ha of commercial
pine plantations had been established, of which 56,000 ha are mainly in three
areas: 7,500 ha in Antsirabe, 30,000 ha in Matsiatra and 18,500 ha in the
Mangoro valley. The Mangoro valley offers encouraging prospects for a large
scale afforestation program, to which the Government has given the highest
priority. The program provides for the planting of 96,000 ha with pine trees
to be used as raw material for a pulp mill to be constructed in Moramanga.
The pulp mill is expected to be operational by 1985 with a planned annual
production of 200,000 tons of bleached sulphate pulp, most of which is expected
to be sold in W4estern Europe. The proposed project would finance the planting
of 35,000 ha under this afforestation program.
22.       Forest-related industry in Madagascar is in an early stage of
development. About 400,000 cubic meters of hardwood saw timber are annually
extracted from the forests. Most of the logs are converted to lumber in the
forest by hand sawing, which causes substantial waste. The forest industry
consists of about 60 saw mills, which processeed 48,000 cubic meters of timber
in 1972, a fiber board plant at Moramanga and a small pulp and paper mill
at Tananarive and some smaller factories producing furniture, parquet floor-
ing and matches. A particle board mill is being constructed in Tananarive.
23.       The Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for forestry
through its Directorate of Forestry (DF). The Directorate plans and imple-
ments forestry development and administers the state forests and provincial
forest service. It is also responsible for the protection of national parks
and wildlife, fresh water fisheries and soil conservation. Its tasks are
carried out by three departments: (i) reforestation and forest industries
management; (ii) national parks, wildlife and fisheries: and (iii) soil
conservation. The DF is efficiently organized with a competent staff con-
sisting of 45 professional foresters and forest technicians, 400 forest rangers
and guards, and a small research unit. In 1973, the DF's budget amounted to
$6.3 million of which about 60 percent was used for afforestation projects
throughout the country. The DF also collects Government's revenues from
wood extracted from the state forests, which are paid directly to the
Ministry of Finance.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
2b.       A report entitled "Madagascar - Appraisal of a Forestry Project"
(No.-50-F4LG),dated December 6, 197lL, is being circulated to the Executive
Directors separately. A loan/credit and project summary is provided in
Annex III.
25.       The project, which would be the Bank Group's first for forestry in
Madagascar, was prepared by the Government with the assistance of the FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Program and the Bank Group and appraised in November/December
1973. Negotiations were held in Washington in August 1974. The Malagasy
delegation vas led by Mr. Pierre Rajaonah, Secretary General of the Ministry
of Rural Development and included Mr. Raphael, Director of Forestry,
Mr. Razakaboaha, Director at the Planning Department, Mr. Ravelonarivo of
the Ministry of Finance and Mr. Randrianasolo, First Secretary of the Malagasy
Embassy in Washington.
The Project Area
26.       The project area is located in the Mangoro Valley which runs parallel
to the eautern coast of the island at about 75 km from Tananarive (see maps
IBRD 10923/4 attached). The valley is about 130 km long and about 20 km wide,
with an altitude varying between 900 and 1,100 meters. Annual rainfall aver-
ages 1,400 mm with the wet season occurring between December and March. It
ig surrounded by high mountain ridges and features rolling grasslands affected
by heavy soil erosion. The Mangoro and Sahabe rivers provide the major water
sources. The valley is served by a railroad which runs from Lake Alaotra to
Moramanga, the main city in the area, and then connects with the Tananarive-
Tamatave railroad. About 3,n00 peasant families, grouped in 36 villages, live
in the project area around and between the areas earmarked for the plantations
and practice rice farming for subsistence on small plots of about 1.5 ha.
They keep about 8,000 cattle mainly as work animals and for- milk production.
Much of the land in the Mangoro Valley is almost totally unsuitable for agri-
cultural production other than extensive poor quality grazing for cattle.
Employment possibilities in the valley are limited and the only cash incomes
are derived from some temporary work in the afforestation program.
27.       To avoid possible conflicts with villagers over customary grazing
rights, the boundaries of the plantations thus far established have been drawn
in agreement with the village communities in the project area. This practice
would be continued during the Mangoro afforestation program. Valley bottoms
would continue to be used for rice cultivation and neither these areas nor the
better grazing lands would be included in the areas to be planted under the
project. Thus any interference with local land use patterns as a result of
the project is expected to be minimal. Nonetheless, should some of the farmer's
land be affected by the afforestation program, the Government would compensate
the farmers in accordance with Malagasy law (Section 3.08 of the Loan Agree-
ment and corresponding supplemental letter). In addition, all farmers in the



project area would benefit from expanded health and educaTion facilaiiva
and irproved rice cultivation through existing and future Government
programsa.
23.       The project to be implemented over a period of five years (1974/75-
1978/79) would be Part of the ongoing Government program to afforest 96,000 ha
in the Mangoro valley. Specifically it would include:
(a) afforestation of 35.000 ha of pilne plantations;
(bl fire control and maintenance of all plantations within the
project area,
(c)  construction and maintenance of about 60 km of service roads,
and 1,750 km of plantation rcads
(d)  construction of project headquarters and three divisional h.ead
quarters and staff and labor facilities;
(e) technical assistance in research, training and preparation of
future forestty projects; and
(f) pasture improvement on about 2,000 ha within the project area.
29.       As indicated in paragraph 16 above, the project would also include
funds to assist the Government in preparing additional projects in agriculture.
Detailed Features of Prpiect Compnents
Establishment of Plantations
3Y.       The methods used thus far in .adagascar to establish tree pl&atations
were developed jointlv by the DF, INDP/FAO and French bilateral assistance.
They have proved successful and would be continued under the proposed project.
About 7,000 ha would be planted each year. The works would start with land
and soil surveys, which would be based on earlier surveys made with the assist-
ance of the IJTD/?FAO. About 12 million seedlings would be needed to complete
the annual planting program and would be provided by several nurseries in the
project area. To ensure a rapid growth of the pines, a small application of
fertilizer would be required prior to planting. To facilitate the implementa-
tion of the prograr., the project area would be divided Lnto Nlor-:hern,Central
and Southern Divisions.  Mhe project provides for -he procurement of anuir-
reor, including btulldozcrs, graders, tractors and other vehicles to carry
out the programu.



-9-
Fire Control
31.       To control fires, a permanent fire unit would be created and equip-
ned in each of the three divisions. Nine fire towers would be constructed at
i5 km intervals and various water points would be installed. About 400 km
of fire breaks would be constructed throughout the project area, while slopes
of hills and valley bottoms would serve as natural fire breaks. The fire breaks
would be cleared annually, including those in about 25,000 ha already planted
under the Mangoro afforestation program.
Construction of Roads and Buildings
32.       About 60 km of gravelled service roads would be constructed linking
the project area with the outside all weather road network. In addition,
about 840 km of plantation truck roads and 910 km of access roads would be
built. rhe fire breaks would be connected with the plantation road system.
33.       The project would provide housing, schools, stores, water supply
facilities and village halls in each of the three Divisions to accommodate
the project staff and laborers permanently employed under the plantation
program. In addition, the quarters would have offices, a garage and a work-
shop. The main quarters of the project area would be located in Moramanga.
Buildings for the Central Division have already been constructed, while
those for the Southern Division would be improved and expanded. The
Northern Division, however, has not yet been established and new buildings
would be constructed there.
Research and Training
3L.       A considerable amount of research has been carried out by the
Government in the Mangoro plantation area. This research would be continued
under the project to facilitate further development of the afforestation
program. It would include studies on yields, growth, use of fertilizers
and disease control measures.
35.       A training center would be established at the central division,
headed by a professional forester. Plantation staff would be instructed
on the establishment and maintenance methods of large scale plantations. The
project includes funds for the provision of staff and equipment for the center.
Pasture Improvement
36.       During project implementation the Government plans to improve
pastures and rice cultivation for subsistence in the project area.    In
support of this program the project would provide $100,000 mainly for
the introduction of stylosanthes (a subtropical legume, which remains
green and provides good feed during the dry season) on 2,000 ha of pasture
within the project area. The use of stylo has been successfully tested
in Madgascar and should    considerably increase the carrying caDacity of
the natural pastures used by the villagers for communal grazing.



-10 -
Future Project Preparation
37.       The project includes funds for technical assistance to the Government
to prepare a second phase of the project. About $500,000 is included for the
preparation of other projects within the agricultural sector as referred to
in paragraph 16, This would enable the Government to hire experts when needed
to strengthen its own services.
Project Implementation
3P.       The project would be executed by FANALAMANGA, a corporation (Societe
d'Economie Mixte) to be established by the Government with substantial admin-
istrative and financial autonomy. Initially, all shares of FANALAMANGA would
be owned by the State, except for one percent of the shares, which will be
held by the Banque Nationale Malgache (BNM), the Malagasy Development Bank.
The structure of FANALAMANGA would allow for local and foreign private partici-
pation at later stages of the Mangoro afforestation program. As a contribution
to its equity capital, the Government would make available to the corporation:
(i) the existing plantations, facilities and equipment of the Mangoro plantation
scheme; (ii) the Government's own contribution to the cost of the proposed pro-
ject, and (iii) an amount equivalent to the proceeds of the Bank loan and IDA
credit as they are withdrawn from Bank/IDA for project implementation.
The establishment of FANALAMANGA would be a condition of credit and loan
effectiveness (Section 6.01 (b) of the Loan Agreement).
39.       The Director General of FANALAMIANGA would have overall responsibility
for project implementation, and the appointment of a suitable candidate to
this post would be a condition of credit and loan effectiveness. (Section
6.01 (c) of the Loan Agreement) He would be responsible to a Board of
Directors, including representatives of the Directorate of Forestry (DF)
within the Ministry of Rural Development, as well as representatives of the
Ministries of Economy and Finance, Interior, Planning, Public Works, and
Tranport. The Board would have full responsibility for policv and financial
matters. FANALAMAINGA would take over part of the existing organization of
the Directorate of Forestry, and would take over the budget, personnel and
functions of the existing Mangoro plantation scheme. The Director General
would be supported for two years by an internationally recruited Forestry
Specialist who would advise on overall project implementation.
bo.       The day to day management of the project would be under the direct
supervision of three Assistant Project Directors -- the Plantation Director,
the Engineering Director and the Financial Director. The Plantation Director
would oversee the afforestation program, fire control and village development.
The Engineering Director would be responsible for the construction of roads
and fire breaks and the maintenance of equipment in the workshops and would
supervise a Workshop and an Electrical Engineer to be stationed at the Central
Division. At the Government's request, the Workshop Engineer would be re-
cruited abroad and assisted by a local counterpart. The Financial Controller
would be responsible for the project accounts, cost control and procurement.



- 1J -
The Plantation Director, the Financial Controller, the Forestry Expert and
the Workshop Engineer whose qualifications and experience should be satis-
factory to the Bank, would be employed within 7 months of the signing of the
Development Credit and Loan Agreements (Section 4.03 (b) of the Loan Agreement).

41.       The Mangoro afforestation program would improve the ecology of the
Mangoro Valley by reducing erosion and improving soil fertility and
water retention. The Government has given assurances that during implementa-
tion of the program sound environmental practices would be followed, in partic-
ular with respect to the eventual construction and operation of the pulpmill
in order to minimize any adverse ecological effects (Section 3.07 (a) of the
Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
L2.       The total cost of the project, exclusive of taxes, is estimated at
$17.2 million with a foreign exchange component of $4.5 million. Imported
materials and equipment required for the project are exempt from taxation.
While some value added tax is levied on the purchase of local materials, their
impact is negligible. The costs of the project include about S3.2 million
for the afforestation program (including $0.9 million for fertilizer to be
applied before first planting), $2.9 million for roads and tracks and fire
protection, $5.8 million for project management, buildings, vehicles and
equipment, $0.8 million for research, training and studies and $0.1 million
for pasture improvement. Cost estimates are based on 1974 price levels;
physical contingencies and provisions for expected price increases amount to
$4.4 million. The proposed IDA credit and Bank loan would cover 78 percent
of the total project cost, including a substantial portion of the local cur-
rency cost. The Government would finance the balance of the local cost esti-
mated at $3.7 million.
Procurement and Disbursement
2J3.      Contracts for service roads and staff houses and for vehicles, eluip-
ment and fertilizers exceeding $30,000 would be awarded after international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Domestic contrac-
tors would be granted a margin of preference of 7.5 percent. Domestic manufac-
turers would be granted a margin of preference equal to the amount of customs
duties or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of these goods, whichever is lower.
Orders below $30,000 would be awarded in accordance with Government procurement
procedures which are satisfactory.   In view of the remo eness of the project
area, and the nattire of the work, other infrastructure- work anid the ei:tablish-
ment of the platntations are unlikely to attract either Iccal or international
competitive bidding and would thierefore be carried out under fcrct acc(c.nt.

J4!I.     The proceeds of the Bank loan and the IDA credit would be disbursed
over a period of six years, first from the credit and then from the loan,
against (a) 75 percent of both foreign and local expenditures for civil works
by contractors and by force account, (b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures
or 75 percent of local expenditures for vehicles, equipment and fertilizer,
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 75 percent of local expenditures
for pasture improvement, consultant services for research, training, for pre-
paration of a second phase project, as well as other projects within the
agricultural sector. Since the afforestation program for 1974-1975 has
already begun, an amount up to $100,000 would be retroactively financed to
cover salary expenditures and administrative costs after November 1, 1974.
Economic Benefits and Rate of Return
)5.       As indicated in paragraph 21, the purpose of the 35,000 ha of pine
plantations is to produce raw material for a pulp mill to be constructed near
Moramanga. The economic justification of the project is therefore based on
the entire Mangoro afforestation program including the plantation of a total
area of 96,000 ha, logging operations over 6,000 ha of 15-year-old pines each
year, the construction of the pulp mill and the subsequent wood processing.
The economic benefits of the program are chiefly determined by the revenues
from the expected pulp sales.
46.       On the basis of experiences obtained in similar afforestation pro-
grams in Madagascar and other countries, it can be expected that by 1985 the
pines of the Mangoro plantations will have grown sufficiently to permit log-
ging operations and pulp production to start. The construction of the
mill at Moramanga would begin in 1982 and would be completed in 1985. The
site of the mill has been projected at the junction of the Mangoro river and
the highway and railway from Tananarive to Tamatave Seaport. Total construc-
tion costs are estimated at about $140 million with a foreign exchange component
of about S80 million. The mill is expected to operate at a satisfactory profit.
FANALAMANGA will eventually be in charge of the construction and operation of
the pulp mill and the Government will explore and request the financial partici-
pation of the private sector in the corporation for this purpose.
L7.       While prices for pulp remained stagnant over the last two decades,
in 1972 increasing demand reached the point where shortages started to occur,
resulting in a significant price increase. Although consequently pulp produc-
tion is expected to expand, a recent analysis by FAO based on current projec-
tions of consumption and production indicates that the current shortage of
pulp will continue at least during the next decade. Tests of pulp produced
from pines grown in the project area compare favorably with pulp produced
in other parts of the world. In addition, the location of the plantations
and the pulp mill close to the Indian Ocean, provides Madagascar with an
advantageous position for exports of pulp products. As most of the pulp is
expected to be sold on the West European markets, the reopening of the Suez
Canal would strengthen the competitive position of the mill. At ftll develop-
ment (21 years after project inception), the annual value of production of



- 13 -
the Mangoro afforestation program (including the pulp mill) is expected to
reach S56 million. After deducting the cost of production, the net annual
incremental economic benefits attributable to the program would be about
$31 million.
I8.       The economic rate of return of the program is estimated at 13 per-
cent. The project would provide regular employment for about 1,600 workers
who to the extent feasible would be recruited from the villagers living in
the Mangoro valley. The villagers would also gain opportunities to sell
agricultural products to project laborers. The ecology of the valley would
be substantially improved by preventing further erosion, increasing soil
fertility and water retention. In addition rural roads in the project area
would be upgraded and pastures improved.
4O.       The main risk involved in the project concerns the projected price
of pulp and consequently the viability of the proposed pulpmill.    Therefore,
although present. price forecasts for pulp are favorable, a conservative
market price has been used in the economic evaluation to take into account
the possibility of a slower price increase than expected. A substantial re-
duction in pulp prices, however.is not likely in view of the projected in-
crease in demand for pulp and the limited possibilities for expanding mill
capacity and wood resources in the world in the next ten years. Another
element of risk is that the projected yields of the plantations,and hence
the production rate of the pulp mill,are based on yields from the first years
of the Mangoro afforestation program and from programs in comparable areas
in Madagascar and elsewhere in the world.   A slower growth rate of the pines
than expected would necessitate a larger plantation area than the 96,000 ha
envisaged or a reduction in the size of the pulp mi11. If growth and price
conditions during the further development of the Mangoro afforestation pr6-
gram were to alter present forecasts significantly, sufficient flexibility
as to the size of the plantations, the scope of the mill and the type of
pulp to be produced would still be available at the beginning of the second
phase of the plantation program when growth and market conditions would be
reevaluated.Comparative calculations at present price levels show hatn. there
are several alternative uses of the plantations' output for different vpes
of pulp or pulD and paper mills with rates of return at acceptable levels.
50.       In the unlikely event that neither the proposed pulp mill nor any
other type of wood processing facility were built, the raw material from the
project plantations could be exported as logs or wood chips. There is an
increasing demand for these products on the world market, and current indica-
tions are that there should be little difficulty in marketing the project
output. If the output from the Mangoro plantations were to be exported as
wood chips, it is estimated that the economic rate of return of the project
would be about 10 percent.

B.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-:/
Credit No. 90-MAG - Road Project; $10 million credit of August 2, 1966;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is now completed with the exception of a feasibility
study and a master plan of three road sections, scheduled for completion
by December 31, 1974.
Loan No. 585-MAG - Beef Cattle Development Proiect; $2.8 million loan of
February 14, 1969; Closing_Date: June 30, 1975
This project was intended to introduce to Madagascar a new system
of land use for beef production. To that end, six cattle ranches were to be
developed, one of which would also produce stylosanthese seeds to improve
pasture. In certain respects, particularly in pasture development, the
project has been successful. On the other hand, it has encountered from the
outset a number of serious problems. Some of them were of a technical nature
in that the imported Brahman bulls were susceptible to steptotricosis which
was not foreseen at appraisal. The surviving animals and their progeny, which
proved resistant to this disease, will, in fact, make a useful contribution
to the improvement of Malagasy livestock but at a considerably greater cost
than would have been encountered had this problem been anticipated. The major
problems, however, resulted from the fact that the scheme had been devised as
an enclave without taking full account of the presence, on the ranch area, of
farmers who had been using large tracts of land for traditional grazing and
for the cultivation of paddy. This created strong opposition against the
ranches and resulted in substantial cattle theft, destruction of fences and
burning of pasture.   Relations 'were also made more difficult by the fact that
ranch management had been entrusted to expatriates who were unable to establish
contact with the local population. Following discussions with the Government,
however, considerable progress has been made in modifying the concept of the
project to make it possible for the local population gradually to share in the
benefits of the project and to use the Oranch as a focal point to spread modern
tehnology in the area. The second livestock project (Credit 506-MAG of
August 21, 1974) includes the financing of three pilot development schemes in
this region which would assist villagers in the development of livestock and
mixed farming enterprises. In addition, expatriate ranch managers have been
replaced by Malagasy nationals. As a result, relations with local farmers
have improved considerably, cattle theft has been drastically curtailed and
the burning of pasture has been reduced. In short, the beginning of an effort
to relate the ranches to the people of the area has been made.    The results
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered and the solutions taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

appear to be favorable but further developments will need to be followed
closely. A Bank supervision mission just returned from Madagascar and its
report is under preparation.
Credit No. 200-MAG - Tamatave Port Proiect; $11.4 million credit
of June 19, 1970: Closing date:   December 31, 1974
Construction of the largest project element, the port extension and
improvement, has been completed four weeks ahead of schedule. Considerably
delays, however, have been experienced in inviting bids for the tanker terminal,
consequently the closing date will need to be extended by about two years. On
the other hand, the reorganization of port administration is proceeding more
slowly than expected. As management assistance provided under the Credit had
not been very effective, IDA agreed at the Government's request to the employ-
ment of Malagasy nationals in the most important posts of Director General
and Chief of Finance of the Port Authority. Port financial and administrative
management is still unsatisfactory, partly as a result of labor unrest. The
Government has agreed to give administrative support to the Director General
and engage accounting consultants for the port.
Credit No. 214-MAG - Lake Alaotra Irrigation Project; $5 million credit
of August 17, 1970; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976
The project's main objective is the expansion and intensification
of paddy production in the Lake Alaotra Region by rehabilitation of the
irrigation and drainage networks on 4,000 ha and construction of such net-
works on about 6,000 ha of marshland. In addition to the 1,200 families
already on Project lands, some 1,700 farming families will be settled. After
initial delays, Project construction has been progressing satisfactorily and
the major civil works were completed by the end of 1973. in accordance with
the revised schedule. SOMALAC, the Project Authority, has suffered from
poor management which has had several consequences, principallv the fact that
virtually no progress has been made so far with respect to settlement of
farmers. However, changes have been made and indications are that satis-
factory progress will be achieved in the near future. A competent new manager
is in post, a study of infrastructure and general layout of the villages has
just been completed and works have started. Finally, a competent consulting
firm has been engaged to re-structure SOMALAC's accouning system.
Credit No. 322-NAG - Morondava Irrigation and Rural Development Project;
$15.3 million credit of June 30, 1972: Closing Date:
June 30, 1979
The projecL as appraised aimed at the production of rice on 4,f(JU ha
and tobacco and cotton on 2,70U ha and 1,9Ul0 respectively.  Pro&ect works in-
clude construction of a diversion darn, rehabilitation of main canals., gravity
and sprinkler irrigation systems, drainage, on-farm developnient works and
construction and extension of villages. The credit became effective in April
1973. Since then, progress on preparatory work has been broadly satisfactory
but the Project is facing serious problems due principally to heavy increases



ANNEX II

in implementation costs. Recent tenders for the major civil works are more
than double the appraisal estimates and it is probable that overall imple-
mentation costs will be greater in about the same proportion. The cost in-
crease is approximately equally attributable to both design changes and to
increases of costs for materials and construction. Estimated total project
costs would amount to at least $6U million, instead of S27 million as ap-
praised. Because project benefits have not risen commensurately it would
now seem that the project as initially envisaged is unlikely to be economi-
cally viable. Any substantial reduction of project costs would require a
restructuring of the Project and a reduction in its scope. A recently re-
turned IDA supervision mission, which held lengthy discussions with the
Covernment on the suitability of alternative options, will complete its
economic and technical analysis in early December.
Credit No. 351-MAG - ($15 million) and Loan No. 876-MAG ($15 million);
Third Highway Project of January 17, 1973:
Closing Date:  December 31, 1977
The major components of the project are construction works on about
400 km of primary roads in the central part of the country, and consulting
services for detailed engineering of a further 200 km of primary roads. Consid-
erable project cost increases are expected as a result of price escalation.
Most of the contracts under this project have been awarded, and physical pro-
gress of the project is generally satisfactory. Bid proposals for the recon-
struction of the road RN1 between Arivoninamo and Analavory were about 50 per-
cent higher than the original estimates. A contract for the construction
of this road has not yet been awarded pending discussions between the Govern-
ment and the Bank on design standard reductions.
Credit No. 488-MAG - Railway Project: $6.0 million credit of June 27, 1974;
Closin_ Date:  June 30, 1976
The Project will assist in financing part of the Malagasy Railways'
1973-75 investment program, services of consultants to improve the railways'
management and operations; and technical assistance to strengthen the planning
cell of the Ministry of Amenagement du Territoire. The credit was declared
effective in September 1974, and project execution is progressing satisfac-
torily.
Credit No. 506-MAG - Village Livestock and Rural Deyelomen    Project:   $9.6
million credit of August 21, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31,L 1979
The project is a broadly based program to assist traditional live-
stock and rural development in the Majunga Province and the Tsiroanomandidy
Sub-prefecture of Tananarive Province, through the provision of improved
veterinary and extension services, as well as essential rural infrastructure
in about 2,000 villages in the project area. Conditions of effecitveness are
to be fulfilled by December 30, 1974.
