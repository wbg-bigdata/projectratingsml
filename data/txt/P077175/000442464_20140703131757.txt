1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and sector background

1.      At the time of appraisal, Indonesia’s proven reserves of natural gas, estimated
at more than 2.5 trillion cubic meters (about 90 trillion cubic feet), were among the
largest in the region. In 2003, gas production amounted to about 87 billion cubic
meters (about 3 trillion cubic feet), of which 58 percent was exported, mainly to
countries in the region. However, gas consumption by power and small and medium
sized industries as proportion of total energy consumption was among the lowest in
the region. Until recently prior to appraisal, the laws and regulations governing the
hydrocarbon sector sanctioned the dominance of PT Pertamina (Persero) and PT
Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) Tbk (PGN). They also allowed the government to
interfere in the sector in ways that inhibited efficient operation and limited
participation of the private sector. Many of the issues the sector faced under the
previous legislative framework were addressed by the 2001 Oil and Gas Law and the
2004 implementation rules and regulations. The law and regulations created an
environment conducive to the removal of the barriers to competition and private
sector entry and to the development of the gas sector and the domestic gas market.
However, at the time of appraisal, the sector was still facing the following interrelated
issues that hampered the rapid development of a domestic gas market:
     a) The structure of gas pricing in Indonesia was distorted, resulting in
        inefficient resource allocation. The price of natural gas in the domestic
        market was below its economic and market value reducing producers’
        interest in developing this abundant resource for domestic use. The negative
        economic impact of this inadequate pricing system was compounded by the
        subsidized prices of petroleum products.
     b) The implementation of the new Oil and Gas Law was proceeding slowly
        because of delayed issuance of the implementation regulations. While the
        law provided the basis for a progressive liberalization of the gas market, its
        implementation had been slow because of the delayed issuance of the
        implementing rules and regulations. The Bank engaged the government on
        this pressing issue and the implementation regulations were enacted on
        October 18, 2004, paving the way for effective implementation of the law.
     c) PGN was not fully prepared to operate in the emerging competitive gas
        market. Under the new Oil and Gas Law, the three major segments of the
        oil and gas industry (production, transmission and distribution) would be
        unbundled, open access to network services would be allowed and
        eventually, a competitive gas market would be developed. To face these
        challenges, PGN planned for: (a) further restructuring, including strategic
        partnership with private sector to increasingly meet new investment
        requirements from its financial resources and standings, a major objective
        assigned to it by the government; and (b) strengthening its management and



                                           1
          operational practices and corporate governance to be ready to operate in the
          future competitive market.
       d) Production-sharing contracts (PSCs) were not conducive to gas
          development. More than 90 percent of Indonesia's oil and gas was
          produced by the private sector, mostly by international oil companies.
          Private sector investment in the sector was almost totally governed by PSCs.
          The fiscal and non-fiscal terms of Indonesia's PSCs were mostly in line with
          international practice. However, many existing contracts still did not have
          provisions for gas discoveries and therefore no predictable basis for
          forecasting the value to the producers of possible gas discoveries for
          domestic markets.
       e) The transmission and distribution infrastructure was underdeveloped.
          The country's transmission and distribution infrastructure was
          underdeveloped and that constrained the development and expanded
          utilization of this economically and environmentally attractive fuel. Progress
          toward a competitive gas market, as envisaged by the Oil and Gas Law 2001,
          required further development of gas transmission and distribution systems.
2.     The broad objectives of the Government of Indonesia's (GOI’s) policy to
reform the energy sector were: (a) efficiency and reliability; (b) transparency and
competition; (c) minimization of the use of public funds; and (d) environmental
soundness. GOI’s strategy with respect to the above gas sector issues includes the
following:
   •    Phasing out of the subsidies and rationalization of energy prices. The
        prices of petroleum products in Indonesia were heavily subsidized. Prior to the
        rapid increases in oil prices that began in 2003, the GOI had implemented
        phased increases in fuel prices that led to a reduction in fuel subsidies and
        more rational energy product prices. Following a Presidential Decree in
        December 2002, the subsidies for all products-with the exception of kerosene-
        were to be fully eliminated by the end of 2004. However, the unprecedented
        surge in global oil prices from 2003 widened the gap between domestic prices
        and current international prices and increased the amount of fuel subsidies.
        The government remained fully committed to addressing the oil product
        subsidy and gas pricing issues and to developing and implementing a rational
        gas pricing policy. Full removal of fuel subsidies would require more time
        than earlier planned and substitution of domestic gas for imported fuels would
        contribute to resolving this issue and benefit the economy and the environment.
   •    Establishment of an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework.
        Many of the sectoral issues had stemmed from the previous inadequate
        legislative framework governing the energy sector. In November 2001, the
        government enacted a new Oil and Gas Law. The law gave Indonesia its first
        modern legal framework to fundamentally reform the oil and gas sector,
        through: (a) the gradual development of a competitive market; (b) the
        establishment of an implementing body for upstream activities and an
        independent regulatory agency for downstream activities; and (c) the
        unbundling of the traditionally vertically integrated oil and gas businesses.
        The issuance of the implementing rules and regulations on October 18, 2004
        was a key step in speeding up the opening of the oil and gas sectors to
        competition and further private investments.


                                           2
     •   Restructuring of the Gas Sector. PGN had already unbundled its key
         transmission activities from its distribution operation. It had associated with
         several strategic partners to create a gas transmission subsidiary, and listed, in
         December 2003, about 39 percent of its shares in the Jakarta and Surabaya
         stock exchange markets. Further restructuring of PGN to allow greater private
         sector participation in its operation and preparation for future sales of its
         shares and assets was under way.
     •   Production-sharing contracts. The new law and regulations provided for a
         competitive environment under which all gas producers could have direct
         access to consumers. The absence of a provision for gas discovery in the
         existing contracts was to be resolved gradually, on a case-by-case basis.

Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.       At appraisal, there were three reasons put forward for Bank involvement.
4.      First, Bank involvement and assistance to PGN would significantly contribute
to adequate and effective implementation of the sound legal framework and policies
developed with Bank support during the preparation of the project. During project
implementation, the Bank would continue the ongoing policy dialogue and
cooperation with GOI and PGN on deepening the reform of the energy sector to
ensure adequate implementation of the recommendations of the analytical and
advisory and technical assistance activities jointly carried out to date. The project
would focus mainly on: (a) designing and implementing an effective gas pricing
policy; and (b) further restructuring of PGN to bring its corporate structure in line
with the new Oil and Gas Law. Appropriate policies in gas pricing and the
restructuring of PGN must be addressed “to improve the climate for high quality
investments” to develop gas use in the domestic market. The Bank’s involvement
would also assure that these two issues are addressed in a timely manner to meet the
market needs according to international best practice and the government reform
objectives. This would pave the way to further opening of the sector and attract
private sector financing to meet the sizeable investment needs to develop it.
5.      Second, the development of a comprehensive gas pricing framework in
relation to the cost of production, transmission and distribution of gas will improve
the transparency of payment and allocation of the rent. The revenues generated by the
development of natural gas from the field to the final users will allow the government
and the regulator to make informed decisions in setting prices after taking into
account efficiency and equity.
6.      Third, the GOI had secured US$500 million from private investors to
Pertamina for further field development and US$485 million from the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) to PGN for a transmission project to increase gas
supply to West Java – the South Sumatera to West Java (SSWJ) transmission line and
a distribution line in West Java. However, the government and JBIC agreed that
additional investment alone is not enough to develop the domestic gas market. The
Bank’s strong global knowledge and experience would be instrumental in addressing
long term policy issues to develop and sustain the domestic gas market. It was agreed
that the JBIC would rely on the Bank to address gas pricing issues to support its
project.

Higher level Objectives to which the Project Contributes

7. The higher level objectives that the project contributed to included:
       i) increasing Indonesia’s national energy security by seeking to switch to
          using more of its abundant natural gas resources domestically, at a time
          when Indonesia’s falling oil production had resulted in it becoming a net
          importer of the oil and refined petroleum products it largely relies on for
          energy supply;
       ii) encouraging investment to increase the supply of gas to meet unmet
           domestic demand by addressing both:
           (1) the physical constraints that limited domestic gas production,
               transportation and distribution; and
           (2) regulatory and commercial factors constraining the development of the
               domestic gas market, including: market structure and competitiveness,
               Open Access arrangements for gas networks, and more transparent and
               economically efficient pricing of gas along the whole gas supply chain;
       iii) reducing the budgetary impact of subsidies on alternative fuels to gas,
            which were rising as a consequence of the rapid increase in global oil
            prices.

8.      At appraisal, the objectives of the project were considered fully consistent
with, and giving substantial support to, two of the five areas identified in the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) as essential to raise investment and improve (energy)
services: (i) fostering a competitive private sector; and (ii) expanding Indonesia’s
infrastructure. The CAS, approved by the Board on October 29, 2003 (Report No.
27108-IND), focused on assistance to Indonesia to overcome the low rate of
investment and to improve the weak public service, two major impediments to
reducing poverty.

9.      The development and implementation of a rational gas pricing policy was seen
as key to improving the efficiency of gas utilization, increasing transparency, and
creating a more attractive environment for private sector participation, and thereby
increasing investment in the supply and utilization of natural gas.

10.    The restructuring of PGN was essential to ease entry into the growing gas
market and to increase private investment in the gas sector. It would align PGN's
corporate structure with the new law and recent regulations, and prepare it to operate
in a competitive environment.
11.     The physical expansion of the gas infrastructure under the project would have
a significant impact on alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks in Indonesia and
improving quality of gas service in West Java. The project supported the
reinforcement of PGN’s distribution system to increase potential supply to about 550
mmcfd, more than three times PGN’s gas sales in the West Java region at the time of
appraisal.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)



                                           4
PDO
12.    There is inconsistency in the PDO in the PAD and in the Loan Agreement. In
the Data sheet and Annex 3 of the PAD, the PDO was described as:
“Natural gas utilization expanded and air pollutant emissions reduced in West Java.”
(Ref. PAD B.2, Technical Annex 3).

However, par. 2.1 of the PAD described the PDO as:

“The objective is to improve economic efficiency and reduce pollution by substituting
gas for more expensive and more polluting fuels, such as diesel, fuel oil and coal.”

13.   The PDOs described above also differ from the PDO which is in the project’s
Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement states:

“The objective of the Project is to improve economic efficiency and reduce pollution
in Indonesia by expanding the use of natural gas in the Borrower’s domestic market.”
(Loan Agreement, Loan No. 4810-IND, Schedule 2).

14.   The Legal Agreement’s version of the PDO is legally binding between the
Bank and the Borrower and therefore should be used for measuring the successful
outcome of the project.
Key Indicators
15.    The key performance indicators focus on the following:
       • An increase in utilization of natural gas;
       • The reduction of air pollutant emissions;
       • Finalization of the gas pricing study and development and implementation
          of a rational natural gas pricing policy according to a schedule acceptable
          to the Bank; and
       • Finalization of the PGN’s restructuring study and development and
          implementation of a restructuring strategy according to a schedule
          acceptable to the Bank.
16.     The project's PDO Indicators measure increases in gas sales and gas
connections in the project areas, and reductions in specific air pollutants in the project
area, relative to a projection of air pollution under a Business-as-Usual energy usage
scenario without the project.
17.     The project's Intermediate Outcome Indicators measure: (i) the physical
delivery of new gas distribution infrastructure in the project area; (ii) further structural
reforms and capacity building at PGN; (iii) the adoption of a new gas pricing
framework built on sound principles of economic efficiency and the effective use of
the that framework to determine gas prices.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

19.     The primary target group benefitting from the project was expected to
comprise industrial, commercial, and residential energy consumers in West Java, who
could switch to using gas instead of more expensive and polluting fuel sources such as
diesel and fuel oil. The primary target group would have access to greater volumes of
gas through a higher capacity and more robust and reliable gas supply network. They
would also benefit from increased transparency in gas pricing, with a shift towards a
pricing framework based on sound economic-engineering principles, and the different
elements of the overall gas price (production, transportation, distribution) being
exposed.
20.     The largest beneficiaries of the primary target group would be large industrial
users of gas, such as power stations, fertilizer and chemical factories, and other energy
intensive industries that could substitute gas for other fossil fuels; primarily fuel oil
and diesel. While small in number, accounting for only 1.3% of PGN’s customer
base, industrial customers and power generation companies account for 97% of
PGN’s gas sales (Table 1). The largest such customers are electricity generation
companies, chemical and fertilizer manufacturers, ceramics, and metal manufacturers;
which together account for 76% of PGN’s total sales to Industries and Electricity
power plants (Figure 1) and 73.6% of PGN’s total gas sales in 2013.

21.    Secondary beneficiaries of the project include: (i) the residential population of
West Java, who would benefit from substantially lower levels of pollutants, including
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Total Suspended Particulates (TSP),
and Carbon Dioxide equivalents (CO2e); (ii) natural gas producers, who would
increase gas sales and gain a larger share of the large West Java energy market; (iii)
owners of gas transmission and distribution lines, who would gain from increased gas
throughput and revenues on an increased asset base; and (v) government.
22.     The gains to government would be three fold. First, as the majority
shareholder of PGN, increased gas sales and increased pipeline revenues increase the
profitability and value of the government’s stake in PGN. Second, fiscal benefits
arising from reductions in the level of fuel subsidy that would have otherwise been
required if industrial users continued to use fuel oil and diesel rather than switching to
gas. Third, the government received technical assistance in further reforming the gas
sector, improving the capacity of PGN, and strengthening regulatory arrangements; all
of which contributed towards the government’s policy objectives of increasing the
efficiency and sustainability of the domestic gas sector and its contribution to wider
economic policy objectives.
23.   These primary and secondary beneficiaries were not explicitly identified in the
PAD, but they are implicit in the design of the project and the formulation of the PDO.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

24.      The original project comprised two components:
a) Distribution Infrastructure Expansion: This component, to be implemented by
   PGN, includes: (i) construction of class 300 steel pipelines 4–16 inches in
   diameter with a cumulative length of about 185 km along with control valves and
   corrosion control facilities; (ii) construction of class 150 steel pipelines of 4 to 16
   inches in diameter with a cumulative length of about 71 km, along with control


                                                        7
   valves and corrosion control facilities; (iii) installation of five off-take and two
   pressure regulation stations; (iv) installation of about 210 customer metering and
   regulating stations; (v) installation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) system; and (vi) provision of radio and telecommunications equipment,
   information technology (IT) support, and emergency response equipment. The
   total cost of this component is US$108.63 million including contingencies and
   value added tax (VAT), with IBRD financing of US$77.00 million.
b) Capacity Building: This component, to be implemented by PGN, involves
   assistance to PGN in upgrading its capabilities and staff skills in financial
   management, infrastructure planning, gas marketing, gas utilization, distribution
   system safety and integrity management, and gas transmission and compression.
   The total cost of this component is US$6.20 million, with IBRD financing of
   US$3.00 million.

1.6 Revised Components
25.     The components were not formally revised, but that during implementation,
several technical outputs and activities under the project’s first component were
altered, without affecting the achievement of related objectives. These are discussed
in Section 1.7 below.

1.7 Other significant changes
26.    The project evolved over time during its implementation, with significant
changes to its original technical design, scale and scope of activities, and
disbursement allocations.
27.     Changes to the technical design, scale and scope of activities occurred on
several fronts.
a) Pipeline lengths, routing, costs and Bank financing. During implementation the
   total length of pipelines to be financed by the Bank was reduced from the 256 km
   estimated at appraisal to 123 km. As a consequence, the relevant contract price
   for this work was reduced. This approximate halving of the pipeline costs funded
   by the Bank arose from: (i) a decision by PGN to use its own funds to rapidly
   build branch lines in the Greater Jakarta and Karawang area (IFB-8B) in order to
   expedite the connection of new customers; (ii) the need to re-align the route of a
   pipeline in the Jakarta area in order to satisfy the requirements of municipal
   planning authorities and gain the necessary work permit.
b) Cost savings of approximately $10.6 million in the Bank loan arose from a
   combination of PGN’s decision to self-finance package IFB-8B (i.e. branch lines
   in the Greater Jakarta and Karawang area) and competitive bidding. These cost
   savings, which related to goods procurement, were later cancelled from the loan
   rather than reallocated to other categories under the loan, as discussed below.
c) SCADA and Telecommunications systems. Major changes to the technical
   specifications of the SCADA and Telecommunications systems package (IFB-4)
   between appraisal and implementation resulted in a substantial increase in the cost
   of this package, a protracted procurement process, and a 36 month extension to
   the project’s implementation period. The specifications were changed to allow
   for: (i) the addition of a back-up master control station for system reliability; and
   (ii) open access architecture.


                                           8
d) Relocation of the Serpong off-take station. Due to difficulties in finding suitable
   land at Serpong, during implementation the planned Serpong off-take station,
   which was evaluated during appraisal, was replaced by two off-take stations at
   Bitung (Bitung 2 and 3).
28.    The changes to project Component 1 (Distribution Infrastructure Expansion)
are summarized in Table 1.

29.    In addition, structural reforms at PGN arising from its commercialization
program resulted in some adjustments to the project’s implementation arrangements
— principally the location of the Project Management Unit within the evolving PGN
corporate structure.
30.     Reallocations between disbursements categories were activities were
requested by GoI but never counter-signed and put into effect. On January 8, 2008,
the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Bank requesting that $10.6 million of the loan be
reallocated between disbursement categories. The amendment sought to utilize costs
savings from the procurement of goods contracts by putting them towards the
increased costs associated with four works contracts. The proposed reallocation was
agreed to by the Bank on February 11, 2008 and sent to the MoF for counter-signature.
However, this proposed reallocation was ever actually countersigned by GoI and
given effect. Instead, the Loan Amendment for the reallocation was caught up in the
protracted budgetary approvals process in both 2008 and 2009 and never actually
implemented. The government later decided to cancel this $10.6 million from the
loan, as discussed below.
31.     Loan terms amended, July 3, 2009. The Loan Agreement was amended on
July 3, 2009 to transform it from a Variable Spread Loan (Loan No. 4810-IND) to a
Fixed Spread Loan (Loan No. 7755-ID). This did not affect project design,
implementation, costs, or outcomes.
32.   A total of $18.2 million was cancelled from the loan (22.8% of the original
$80 million loan value) in two stages, together with extensions in the loan’s closing
date.
33.     First closing date extension and first request for Partial Loan Cancellation.
On December 14, 2010 the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Bank requesting the
cancellation of US$10.6 million of the loan amount and extending the closing date of
the project by 36 months to March 31, 2014. On January 5, 2011, the closing date of
the project was extended to March 31, 2014, to allow sufficient time for the SCADA
system (IFB-4) to be redesigned for open access and then procured, installed and
commissioned. During early 2011 PGN sought to persuade the Ministry of Finance
that the US$10.6 million in unused funds be reallocated towards the final contract
payment for IFB-2, Greater Jakarta Distribution Mainline, rather than having this
amount of the loan cancelled. However, after discussions between PGN and MoF, it
was decided that MoF’s original partial loan cancellation request would remain
unchanged.
34.    First Partial Loan Cancellation. On July 4, 2011, US$10.6 million was
cancelled from the loan, retroactive to December 21, 2010. The consequence of this
cancellation was that PGN funded the additional costs of Works using its own
finances, including the works on the Greater Jakarta Distribution Mainline (IFB-2).
35.     Second Partial Loan Cancellation and second closing date extension. On
October 30, 2013 another US$7.6 million of unneeded loan financing was cancelled
(effective from February 1, 2013). In addition, since all investments were already
completed, the project closing date was advanced from March 31, 2014 to October 30,
2013 in order close the loan ahead of time.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
36.    There was no review of quality at entry by the Bank's Quality Assurance
Group (QAG).

37.    However the ICR’s assessment is that quality at entry was good, for the
following reasons.
38.     First, the project responded to the priorities and wishes of the GoI and built on
the lessons of earlier gas distribution projects in Indonesia by having:
   a) Extensive consultations with the GoI and PGN on: (i) the project’s design and
      implementation arrangements; (ii) how the project might support ongoing
      strategic structural reforms in Indonesia’s gas and electricity markets; (iii)
      inter-linkages with PGN’s least cost gas networks expansion plans, including
      major capital works co-financed by the Japan Bank for International
      Cooperation (JBIC); and (iv) the development of new gas supply fields and
      PGN’s efforts to secure additional volumes to meet to increased demand for
      gas in West Java.
   b) Gas pricing reforms and further restructuring of PGN as key issues to be
      addressed in order to accelerate the development of the domestic gas market.
      The Bank’s past lessons with gas distribution projects in Indonesia indicate the
      critical importance of ongoing Bank involvement in strategic energy sector
      policy development and the creation of an enabling environment that fosters
      commercialization of incumbent energy providers, market entry, and increased
      competition;
   c) A strong focus on expanding the capacity, efficiency, safety and reliability of
      gas infrastructure networks; and
   d) Improved access for customers to natural gas, a fossil fuel abundant in
      Indonesia, which is less polluting than diesel, fuel oil and coal.
39.      Second, the design supported rapid start-up and by the time of project
negotiations on October 24, 2005 the Goods and Works sub-projects had feasibility
studies finalized, together with conceptual designs. In the second half of 2004 PGN
had established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and a Procurement Committee,
which were to later be supported by a firm acting as Project Management Consultant
(PMC). PGN’s selection and appointment of the PMC in the second half of 2005 was
designed to ensure that the procurement packages for the project were prepared ahead
of the project being approved by the Bank’s Board. While arrangements to ensure
rapid start up were generally good, there were still delays due to shortcomings in
initial procurement and contracting, as described in Section 2.2.
40.    Third, there were comprehensive public consultations on the project during
preparation. PGN convened three public consultations in Jakarta and several
consultations in project affected areas with representatives from most of the
stakeholder groups: government agencies, property owners, local businesses, NGOs
and academia.
41.   Fourth, the key risks to the Development Objective, identified at appraisal,
were comprehensive and the proposed risk mitigation actions were effective during


                                           11
implementation. The key risks identified at appraisal were: (i) gas supply being lower
than expected; (ii) customer conversions to gas being slower than planned; (iii) a lack
of political commitment by government to rationalize energy pricing and phasing out
subsidies on the prices of oil products; (iv) fraud or corruption resulting in cost
overruns or poor quality outputs or subprojects. The two key risks to Implementation
Progress identified during appraisal were: (i) potential delays in construction; and (ii)
procurement delays. At the time of appraisal, the project’s overall risk rating was
“Modest” and it was not expected to have any controversial aspects.
42.     There were considerable periods of time between the project’s conception
(July 2003), to appraisal (January 2005), and then to approval (December 2005).
These delays in project preparation arose from a range of factors, including:
       i) Delays during 2003 and 2004 in PGN completing a gas system
          optimization study, the results of which would affect the configuration and
          design the gas distribution system and consequently the scope, cost and
          timing of the project.
       ii) Difficulties in finalizing both the safeguards arrangements and the
           economic and financial evaluation of the project, due to the
           abovementioned delays in finalizing its scope, cost and timing;
       iii) Uncertainties in PGN securing sufficient volumes of gas following the
            government’s decision to reallocate gas previously earmarked for PGN to
            PLN, and the expiration of some existing gas contracts. In October 2003
            the Government directed PGN to forego its planned supply contract to
            purchase about 160 mmcfd gas from the CNOOC field, and instead allow
            that source of supply be used by PLN, given PLN's critical need for gas to
            fuel its power plants. PGN subsequently had to negotiate and secure new
            supply contracts during 2004 and 2005.
       iv) The Initial Public Offering (IPO) of PGN shares in December 15, 2003;
           and
       v) The protracted period of time required to consult with and gain the support
          of a broad range of government and regulatory stakeholders on the design
          and scope of key aspects of the project’s technical component, in particular
          those relating to further restructuring of PGN, open access for gas
          networks, and gas pricing reforms.
43.     Although project preparations, appraisal and negotiations took two and half
years to complete, they resulted in a well-structured project that was tailored to meet
the evolving needs of the gas sector and the government’s policy priorities.
44.     The reform of gas and other energy markets in Indonesia, like elsewhere
around the globe, takes a considerable period of time. Indonesia’s domestic gas
sector, like other parts of its energy sector, has a range of serious, entrenched and
fundamental and inter-related distortions. Some of these distortions benefit vested
interests, who will seek to delay or stop reforms. Unravelling these distortions takes
strong and sustained political will and requires careful consideration of the policy,
economic and commercial consequences of various reform options before decisions
can be made and reforms implemented.
45.     Consequently, the preparation time of this project was more than reasonable in
light of the scope of: i) the capital works contemplated and where they were located


                                           12
in the densely populated West Java region; and ii) the institutional, regulatory and gas
market reforms that the project supported.

2.2 Implementation
46.     PGN had previous experience in implementing three previous IDA financed
projects and as such was familiar with Bank procedures. In addition, PGN had several
loans with Asian Development Bank (ADB), JBIC and others, which employ similar
procurement arrangements to the Bank. Nonetheless, the PIU, Procurement
Committee and PMC all needed to acquire or enhance their understanding of the
fiduciary requirements, processes and procedures of the Bank – both ahead of and
during implementation.
47.    However, despite this readiness for implementation, shortly after the February
6, 2006 signing of the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement, the Bank’s March
2006 supervision mission found that implementation progress for both Goods and
Works contracts and Consultancy Services contracts was between three to five
months behind schedule. These early delays arose from a combination of sources,
including: (i) the initial poor quality of bidding documents for the first Goods and
Works packages (IFB-1 and IFB-5) resulting in a lengthy time period before the Bank
could issue No Objections for the bidding documents; and (ii) the Project
Management Consultant (PMC) initially being unfamiliar with the Bank’s
requirements in relation to procurement procedures, guidelines and bidding
documentation.

48.   Supervision missions, and the June 2010 Mid-Term Review, highlighted a
number of factors that affected project implementation, as detailed below.
       i) Strong competition for goods and works, combined with changes in the
          specifications of several large contract packages (e.g. IFB-1), and
          decisions by PGN to self-finance a large package (IFB-8B), generated
          significant savings. These savings were initially expected to result in the
          reallocation of funds across the various Loan Categories, but as discussed
          in Section 1.7 above, these savings were instead cancelled from the Loan.
       ii) Changes in the scope of works after bidding documents were issued risked
           delaying the implementation of the project. This was an issue for several
           major contract packages, including those for the Offtake Stations (IFB-3),
           Construction of Branch line in Banten (IFB-8A).               Similarly, the
           complexity of the SCADA and Telecommunications package (IF-4), and
           several critical changes to its specifications resulted in long delays in the
           bidding documents being finalized and issued.
       iii) PGN was slow to formally approve the technical assistance reports by
            consultants and to then implement the findings and recommendations of
            the reports. These reports included recommendations on: planning;
            customer management; asset integrity, security and safety; and gas pricing
            reforms.

49.     The implementation and outcomes of the project were positively affected by
four things:
       i) The “dash to gas”, with a significant increase in the number of new
          customers who connected to PGN’s networks as a result of: a) reductions


                                          13
          in fuel oil and diesel subsidies for industry making gas a much more
          attractive fuel; b) PGN’s gas marketing activities; c) network upgrades and
          extensions, and the increased availability of gas;
       ii) The significant increase in gas supply volumes to West Java from fields
           operated by Pertamina SSWJ, Conoco Philips, and MEDCO. This new
           gas supply was critical to the achievement of the PDO;
       iii) Timely and smooth land acquisition at four of the five sites for meter
            regulating stations (IFB-3) and for distribution pipelines located along the
            right of way of roads; and
       iv) Broad support to reform gas regulatory and pricing arrangements.

50.    There was no QAG review of the quality of supervision for this project.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

51.     The KPIs used in the project, both at the PDO outcome level and the
Intermediate outcome level, were appropriate and will remain relevant and suitable
into the future.
52.    The KPIs provide readily quantifiable measures of the physical PDO outcomes
— specifically increases in gas sales and customer connections in the areas targeted
by the project; together with reductions in major air pollutants and greenhouse gas
emissions.
53.     The KPIs for intermediate outcomes were also straightforward and useful: the
Commissioning into service of gas transmission and distribution pipelines (length of
pipes), number off-take stations and metering regulating stations.
54.    However, the intermediate level KPIs in the results framework for Component
2 (Technical Assistance/Capacity Building), are in some cases weak because they do
not effectively measure the successful implementation of the TA’s reform
recommendations, but simply require a set of recommendations to be prepared and
reviewed by PGN and others (e.g. Ministry of Energy and Mining Resources, BPH
Migas) with a view towards their eventual adoption.
55.     The design, collection and utilization of the M&E data for the project was
carried out effectively by PGN throughout the project and served a useful means of
tracking both progress and measuring impacts of the investments financed by the
project.
56.      In 2009 the rate of disbursements was slow, with only around 17% of the
projected annual disbursements actually taking place. The slow disbursement rate in
2009 arose from the protracted delays in approval of the Indonesian budget, which
held up approval of the project’s 2009 Supplementary Loan Agreement budget until
late in the year. Once the 2009 Supplementary Loan Agreement budget was approved,
disbursements re-commenced on December 4, 2009.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance




                                          14
57.     At appraisal, it was determined that the project triggered two safeguards
polices: OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment); and OP4.12 (Involuntary
Resettlement).
58.    Although OP4.12 was triggered, there is an inconsistency in the project
documentation; specifically the PAD’s data sheet mistakenly omits the triggering of
the OP4.12 but both the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement refer to the Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework dated January 31, 2005. This
omission of OP4.12 from the PAD appears to be an editorial oversight, which did not
affect either the project’s preparation or execution in relation to meeting the
requirements of OP4.12.
59.    The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and Environmental
Management Plan was established during project preparations, which includes Public
Consultation and Disclosure as required under Indonesia's AMDAL (Analisis
Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan Hidup) process and a framework on land acquisition,
namely General Policy on Land Acquisition and Compensation. An Environmental
Coordinating Office (ECO) was established within PGN to monitor environmental
management and monitoring as required under the PAD.
60.    The environmental and social impacts of the project are discussed below,
together with a short assessment of compliance with the safeguards policy
requirements.
Environmental safeguards
61.     At appraisal, the project was assigned an Environmental Category A because
of its link to the JBIC-financed SSWJ transmission project. The SSWJ gas
transmission project comprises: the SSWJ transmission line (32” to 24” diameter,
1064 km), the Bojonegara-Serpong gas transmission line (24” diameter, 70 km), and
an associated distribution line (SSWJ Distribution Cilegon, 16” diameter). The
Bojonegara-Serpong gas transmission line would to provide much of the new gas to
be distributed in West Java area via the new distribution lines financed by this IBRD
project. The Bank also monitored the land acquisition process of the JBIC and PGN-
financed Bojonegara-Serpong Transmission line, due to its linkage to the project.
62.      Based on the Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) prepared by
PGN, the project was not expected to have any significant impact on natural habitats,
forests or protected or sensitive areas. None of the impacts from the construction or
operation of the pipelines were considered likely to be sustained or irreversible. The
major negative environmental impacts would be temporary interference to the traffic
in the project area and some temporary air and water pollution, as well as the removal
of vegetation during the construction of the project. None of them, however, were
assessed as likely to be major, sustained or irreversible. Positive environmental
benefits would arise from significant reductions in air pollutants and greenhouse gas
emissions, as a result of the switch by targeted customers to natural gas from other
fossil fuels.
63.     The environmental safeguards compliance of the project was satisfactory, with
it being consistently in compliance with the environmental safeguard policies and
environmental performance requirements. The Environmental Monitoring System
(EMS) put in place operated effectively using a cooperative mechanism between
contractors, PGN, local authorities, and local communities. As required under the
EMS, PGN prepared and submitted quarterly reports to the Bank on environmental


                                         15
management and monitoring that covered all project activities; and these reports were
considered satisfactory by the Bank. In general, any adverse environmental impacts
or concerns were reported and solved with the participation of relevant stakeholders.
64.      During the course of project implementation, PGN also took positive steps to
mainstream environmental management into its corporate activities. First, on
February 1, 2008, the ECO was established as a division under vice presidency.
Second, on January 12, 2009, PGN formally established the Committee for Health,
Safety and Environmental Management (K3PL), which go beyond the project specific
activities of ECO. Third, PGN sought to bolster its capacity in HSE management
through staff recruitment and training.
65.     Following the completion of construction works in June 2010 (i.e. Mid-Term
Review), the Bank requested that bi-annual reports on environmental management
and monitoring be prepared by PGN’s K3PL team in the period to the close of the
project. In addition to post construction environmental management and monitoring,
the bi-annual report was also expected to cover safety and emergency response
incidents.


Social safeguards — Land Acquisition
66.      At the time of project appraisal, it was concluded that there would be no
involuntary resettlement and no impact on indigenous people or cultural property
under the project. The adverse environmental and social impacts of the project were
considered to be minor. The gas pipelines of the project would be built primarily in
largely urbanized or industrial areas, all alongside existing roads. Businesses,
residents and other facilities along the roadsides could suffer some temporary (up to
one day) disruption caused by construction activities. In addition, there could be
increased risk of pedestrian injury from traffic accidents during construction because
of physical obstruction or removal of walkways. To minimize these disruptions, PGN
has standard operating procedures and prevention and mitigation measures in place. It
also agreed to compensate any affected businesses for loss of income according to the
General Policy on Land Acquisition and Compensation agreed with the Bank during
project preparation.     In addition, PGN has a strong commitment to social
responsibility and has supported the communities along its transmission and
distribution right-of-way. In 2002, a Master Plan for Community Development was
drafted to provide corporate guidelines on community development (ComDev)
programs. In conducting its ComDev program, PGN has worked closely with
universities, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local governments. These
institutions will help PGN assess local need and play important roles in project
implementation and in monitoring social outcomes.
67.     Prior to and during the project, extensive public consultations were carried
out. Consultation with the public at the local level is an important component of
Indonesia's AMDAL process. During the project preparation, PGN convened three
public consultations in Jakarta and several consultations in project affected areas with
representatives from most of the stakeholder groups: government agencies, property
owners, local businesses, NGOs and academia. During the project implementation,
consultation was governed by the AMDAL and Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) processes.




                                          16
68.     The land acquisition process used during implementation appears to have been
satisfactory and in compliance with OP4.12, the General Policy on Land Acquisition
and Compensation agreed to during preparations, and AMDAL. It used a normal
transaction approach with market price as a basis for land value, similar to a willing-
seller, willing-buyer transaction.    An outline of land acquisition relating to the
project’s Metering Regulation Station and distribution pipelines follows; together
with a discussion of the land issues around the linked Bojonegara-Serpong gas
transmission pipeline.
69.     Meter Regulation Stations. Land was acquired for five meter regulation
stations (IFB-3) in four locations and for the distribution pipelines.
70.     Distribution pipelines. Gas distribution pipelines did not require any land
acquisition because they were installed roadside rights of way. PGN obtained
permission to use these rights of way from the Ministry of Public Works and from
respective local governments. As agreed upon in the General Policy on Land
Acquisition and Compensation in the market area, pipeline construction activities
were carried out during non-business hours and mainly at night, in order to greatly
minimize any potential negative economic impacts on local traders. This is a
common practice followed by PGN for the installation of pipelines.
71.    Linked Bojonegara-Serpong gas transmission pipeline
       i) Due to the linkage between the project and the PGN and JBIC-financed
          Bojonegara-Serpong gas transmission pipeline, the land acquisition
          processes for the Bojonegara-Serpong gas pipeline were carefully
          reviewed by the Bank project preparation.      This Bank found these
          processes acceptable and as a condition of project approval required
          regular updates on this linked investment during project supervision; in
          particular its social safeguards aspects.
       ii) As required during supervision, PGN regularly provided the Bank with
           documentation on the Bojonegara-Serpong gas transmission pipeline. The
           land acquisition processes followed by PGN for the Bojonegara-Serpong
           line were in compliance with the plan agreed to during preparations;
           specifically:
           (1) PGN followed the procedure for land acquisition set out in the
               Indonesian Regulation for land acquisition for public purposes — i.e.
               President Regulation No. 36/2006 (and its revision, President
               Regulation No. 65/2007) and Regulation of Head of Land Agency No
               3/2007 — even though gas provision is not categorized as a public
               purpose under President Regulation No. 65/2007.
           (2) Independent land appraisal was used to determine the land value of the
               affected areas, while the final figure for land price was arrived at
               through negotiation.
       iii) During supervision, there were no complaints regarding the level of
            compensation paid for land acquired for the Bojeonegara-Serpong
            transmission pipeline.
72.    In conclusion, at the end of the project, the overall compliance with social
safeguard policies triggered by the project was satisfactory.



                                          17
Procurement
73.     At the time of appraisal, the overall project risk for procurement was assessed
as average. The key issues and risks around procurement were seen to be: (a)
corruption and collusive practices — which are perceived as a nation–wide issue; (b)
the tight implementation schedule and risks arising from procurement delays; in
particular the potential financial risk to PGN from having to pay for gas through the
SSWJ transmission line from the end of 2006 under a “take-or-pay” contract before
three key elements of the Bank-financed distribution network expansion were
completed. Specifically, without the Banten distribution mainline (IFB-1), greater
Jakarta distribution mainline (IFB-2) and the new off-take substations (IFB-3), PGN
could end up in the unenviable position of having to pay for gas that it was unable to
actually sell to customers due to the lack of distribution infrastructure.
74.     The design and implementation of the project were effective in limiting
procurement risks. The project’s design included the following measures: (a) the
development of an Anti-Corruption Plan and Strategy (discussed further below); (b)
the hiring of external Project Management Company to assist in project
implementation and management, including prequalification and bidding documents,
bid evaluation, contract negotiation, contract management, and cost–schedule–quality
control; (c) a procurement plan with a clearly defined scope and detailed procurement
and construction schedule. The use of supply and installation (or EPC — Engineering,
Procurement, and Construction) arrangements for most of the works was designed to
reduce procurement risks, as was the use of ICB and Bank Prior-review. NCB was to
be used for only four works packages. Consultant firms would be hired using
competitive selection (QCBS or QBS) with Bank prior review; (d) the hiring of a firm
to act as a Third Party Inspector, tasked with independent inspection and certification
of goods and works.
75.     During implementation, the overall procurement performance of the project
was satisfactory and in compliance with the agreed procurement arrangements. The
large and diverse range of subprojects required a mix of ICB contracting for goods for
most works, the limited use NCB contracting (for four installation contracts), and
these were generally well executed by the PIU using the Bank’s procedures.


Financial Management
76.    At appraisal, the financial management assessment for the project concluded
that overall, the financial management risks are moderate and that it would be
appropriate to accept the entity annual audited financial statements for Bank purposes,
with appropriate disclosures on the use of the Bank funds. FM risk mitigation
measures designed into the project included: (i) the adoption of quarterly Financial
Management Reports (FMRs); (ii) external audits by leading private sector accounting
firms; and (iii) strengthened procedures for validating and approving payments to
contractors.
77.     The financial management performance ranged between Moderately
Satisfactory and Satisfactory throughout the Project implementation period. Quarterly
FMRs submitted were acceptable to the Bank despite a few delays in timely
submission. Audited financial statements and audit reports were generally submitted
to the Bank on time and were of acceptable quality. None of the audits were qualified.
Financial Performance and compliance with financial covenants


                                          18
78.    PGN’s financial performance was considered sound at the time of project
appraisal, including through the years of the Asian financial crisis (1997-2000).
79.      The 2003 Audited Financial Statements provide a snapshot of PGN’s business
at the time of appraisal:
    a) Revenues and Expenditures. In 2003, PGN generated a total revenue of
       US$425 million, comprising (i) US$350 million (82.4 percent of the total
       revenue) from sales of natural gas through its distribution networks, (ii)
       US$74 million (17.4 percent of the total revenue) from fees earned for gas
       transmission services, and (iii) less than US$500,000 (less than 0.2 percent of
       the total revenue) from sales of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
    b) Assets. PGN’s total assets in 2003 were about US$1.08 billion, including
       current assets of US$418 million. Cash and cash equivalent represented 54
       percent of its current assets, and short-term investments represented an
       additional 19 percent. The large cash account was the result of proceeds from
       the multilateral or bilateral loan borrowing, a US$150 million Eurobond issue,
       and a December 2003 public offering of about 39 percent of its shares.
    c) Liabilities. PGN’s long-term debt in 2003 was about US$330 million, mostly
       consisting of “two-step loans,” owed to the government for the funds
       borrowed from the ADB, JBIC, European Investment Bank (EIB), and World
       Bank for its capital expenditures.
    d) Equity. PGN’s total equity in 2003 was about US$390 million.
80.     Due to the project’s central role in supporting PGN in adapting to the new and
more competitive domestic gas market and in growing the size of that market, PGN’s
financial performance was carefully monitored by the Bank through the project’s
implementation period.
81.   The project loan included three financial performance covenants, requiring
PGN to:
   a) Generate sufficient revenue from its internal sources equivalent to at least 25
      percent of its average three-year capital expenditures.
   b) Demonstrate that a reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures for
      each fiscal year would produce sufficient net revenue to be at least 1.5 times
      its estimated debt service requirements.
   c) Not incur any debt, if after the incurrence of such debt the ratio of debt to
      equity shall be greater than 75:25 during 2005-2009 and 70:30 thereafter.
82.      Throughout the project implementation, and at the project’s close, PGN’s
financial performance was strong and it remained in compliance with the financial
covenants under the loan. At the end of 2012, PGN’s self-financing ratio was 135 per
cent, its Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) 9.17 times, and its debt to equity ratio
30:70.

83.     PGN’s 2013 Audited Financial Statements reveal a dramatic change in the size
and scope of PGN’s business at the end of the project. In 2013 PGN’s revenues were
6.5 times the size of those in 2003, its assets over 4 times larger than ten years earlier,
and its equity 7 times larger than in 2003. Profits in 2013 were close to US$0.9
billion, with a healthy profit rate of approximately 30% on revenues. In addition to


                                            19
downstream gas transmission, distribution and sales, by 2013 PGN had also
established an upstream Oil and Gas exploration business, as well investments in
LNG processing.
      a) Revenues and Expenditures. In 2013, PGN generated a total revenue of
         US$3.001 billion, comprising (i) US$2.770 billion (92.3 percent of the total
         revenue) from sales of natural gas through its distribution networks, (ii)
         US$0.18 billion (6.0 percent of the total revenue) from fees earned for gas
         transmission services, and (iii) US$34.8 million (less than 1.2 percent of the
         total revenue) from exploration of Oil and Gas; and (iv) US$16.7 million
         from Other Operations (i.e. fibre optic rental for network services,
         construction and O&M services to customers), which accounted for 0.56% of
         total revenues.
      b) Assets. PGN’s total assets in 2013 were US$4.36 billion, including current
         assets of US$1.78 billion. Cash and cash equivalents (US$1.32 billion)
         represented 74 percent of its current assets, and short-term investments
         represented an additional 4.8 percent.
      c) Liabilities. PGN’s long-term debt in 2013 was about US$612 million, 84%
         of which were “two-step loans,” owed to the government for the funds
         borrowed from the ADB, JBIC, European Investment Bank (EIB), and World
         Bank for its capital expenditures.
      d) Equity. PGN’s total equity in 2013 was about US$2.73 billion.
      e) Profit. PGN’s net profit before tax for 2013 was US$0.894 billion
         (representing a profit rate of 29.8% on total revenues and a 32.7% return on
         equity).
84. The project played a significant part in the transformation of PGN, by facilitating
    increased gas supplies into West Java, institutional and regulatory strengthening,
    and the introduction of gas pricing reforms. This is discussed further below and in
    Annex 2.
Anti-Corruption Plan
85.    To address perceptions about endemic corruption in Indonesia, and Anti-
Corruption Action Plan was formulated as part of project preparations. The Action
Plan identified potential risks of corruption and specified appropriate mitigation
measures. Given that the project budget was dominated by expenditure related to
building new gas infrastructure, the plan focused on reducing the potential of
corruption around procurement.
86.     Through the course of project implementation, PGN followed the Anti-
Corruption Action Plan, with one exception early on in the project — the publication
of contract award information in 2006 and early 2007. This was remedied in April
2007 when PGN published on its own website — and that of UNDB and dgMarket —
a summary table of contracts awarded to then. Thereafter, PGN regularly submitted
Anti-Corruption Implementation Progress reports to the Bank; review of which
indicates that PGN was in compliance with the Anti-Corruption Action Plan agreed to
with the Bank; including publication of data on contracts awarded.
87.     There are no known issues of corruption relating to this project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase


                                           20
88.    Following completion and commissioning of new gas network augmentations
in West Java, the operation and maintenance of assets was transferred to the
operational division of PGN.
89.      The sustainability of benefits arising from the project will be contingent on the
gas infrastructure in the project area continuing to be capable of reliably meeting
increased gas demands over time. Improvements in long term planning in Indonesia’s
domestic gas market requires a stable and sensible policy framework, with a clear
strategic vision by government, effective planning of and investments in gas networks,
appropriate incentives and contractual arrangements for ongoing development of gas
fields to supply domestic markets, and ongoing reforms to gas pricing and subsidies to
alternative fossil fuels. The development of a more competitive gas market, as
envisaged under the Oil and Gas Law, will also depend significantly on further
reforms to Indonesia’s electricity sector, which could eventually substitute gas for the
large volumes of diesel, fuel oil and coal currently used for power generation.
90.      The capacity building provided by the Technical Assistance in the area of gas
system planning will contribute to sustaining the outcomes of the project. Other
technical assistance provided through the course of the project has also bolstered
institutional capacity in the areas of: a) Operations and Asset Integrity Management;
b) Quantitative Risk Assessment; c) Gas Transmission and Supply; d) Gas Marketing,
Sales, and Customer relations; e) information technology and management
information systems; f) The technologies utilized by gas consumers, including gas air-
conditioning, gas engines, gas turbines, cogeneration, and steam boilers; g) Gas
pipeline construction. For details, see Annex 2.
91.     The broader gas sector reform agenda is also expected to contribute to
sustaining reforms, including through: (i) implementation of recommended reforms to
gas tariffs to improve economic efficiency; (ii) further commercialization of PGN,
including potential further increases in the shareholding level of the private sector;
(iii) implementation of regulatory reforms; and (iv) effective application of the Third
Party Access regime for gas networks.
92.     The ongoing engagement of the Bank in Indonesia’s energy sector has a range
of strategic follow up operations to this project, including: a) technical assistance to
on ways to further develop Indonesia’s domestic gas market; b) power sector
investments in transmission (Power Transmission Project and proposed 2nd Power
Transmission Project) and pumped storage hydro-generation (Upper Cisokan); c) the
IFC’s investments in Medco Power Indonesia to own and operate gas and
hydroelectric projects; d) the Bank’s Geothermal Clean Energy Project; e) Advisory
services on electricity and fuel subsidies and a regulatory framework for the
electricity sector; f) TA on the development of Public Private Partnerships (PPP)
Framework and Policy; g) increasing access to modern energy services in rural and
remote parts of Indonesia; and h) Advice on potential PPP candidate projects in the
energy sector, particularly geothermal power. 1

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
93.      The project objectives and design remain highly relevant to the development
priorities of Indonesia. The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Indonesia,
covering the period FY2013 to FY2015 is aligned with the GoI’s Master Plan for
Economic Development 2011-2025 (MP3EI), 2 which seeks to create economic
growth, jobs, reduce poverty through creating conducive macro-economic and
regulatory conditions for the acceleration and expansion of investments. This project
contributes to those objectives because it has supported the ongoing energy sector
reform agenda; key elements of which involve: harnessing private sector financing of
new energy infrastructure, electricity and gas market development, and utilizing
domestic gas supplies to support Indonesia’s economic growth and development.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
94.     The project has fully achieved its stated project development objective of
“improving economic efficiency and reducing pollution in Indonesia by expanding the
use of natural gas in the Borrower’s domestic market.”
95.      The PDO Indicators focused on Component 1 of the Project. In addition, the
project achieved its implicit and more fundamental objectives in Component 2 of the
project that relate to improving the economic efficiency of the domestic gas market.
The project’s technical assistance was instrumental in improving some aspects of the
domestic gas pricing regime and in facilitating competition through the creation of a
more effective open access regime for gas transmission.
96.    Targets for all 6 PDO performance indicators have already been achieved
and/or exceeded.
Component 1 of Project
Utilization of natural gas increased
97.    The Project contributed to the dramatic increase in natural gas usage in West
Java, by facilitating increased gas distribution capacity, and improved marketing of
gas to new industrial customers that led to increased customer connections in West
Java. Other factors leading to increased gas usage in West Java include new gas
supply contracts being signed by PGN and reductions in fuel subsidies to industrial
customers that resulted in “dash to gas”.
98.      The PDO indicators show:
      a) PGN’s gas sales in the project area (mmcfd): The target for PGN gas sales
         was exceeded on schedule — by 31 Dec 2010 sales were 573 mmcfd or
         135% above the 2010 targets. By the end of the project, PGN’s gas sales
         were 224% above the target value of 423 mmcfd for end 2010;

                                                   22
   b) Cumulative number of consumers converted to gas. The target of 120 gas
      conversions was exceeded in December 2010, by which time 444 conversions
      to gas had taken place; which exceeded the target by 370%. By the close of
      the project, gas conversions were 498% above the original target value.
Air pollutant emissions reduced in West Java
99.     The large increase in the use of natural gas resulted in the displacement of fuel
oil and diesel as energy sources, and in doing so reduced the levels of pollutants and
greenhouse gas emissions.
100. The reductions in major air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs)
emissions (1000 tons per year) in the project area were:
   a) SO2: By the end of 2010, SO2 reductions amounted to 90,180 tons per year,
      which exceeded the 2010 target by 61%.
   b) NOx: Realized reductions in annual NOx                    emissions    for   2010,
      108,948tons/year, exceeded the target by 160%.
   c) TSP: Reductions in the annual volume of emissions of Total Suspended
      Particulates (TSP) were 51,230 tons per year in 2010, which were 160% of the
      2010 target.
   d) Greenhouse Gases (CO2e): The increased use of natural gas, and displacement
      of other fossil fuels in West Java, resulted in a significant reduction in annual
      CO2e emissions (2,645,376 tons/year) that exceeds the 2010 target by 160%.
101. The achievement of these PDO targets was largely due to the timely delivery
of the project’s gas supply infrastructure, combined with effective efforts to market
gas as a fuel to large industrial customers.
Component 2 of Project
Gas market development and structural reform
102. The project was part of and supported a large scale transformation in PGN's
business and the implementation of fundamental reforms to Indonesia's domestic gas
market, which aimed to improve the economic efficiency of the gas sector, the
broader energy sector, and the economy in general. These reforms to the domestic gas
market presented PGN with both new opportunities and challenges.
103. The Oil and Gas Law 2001 resulted in PGN losing its self-regulated quasi-
monopoly on domestic gas transmission and distribution; and facing the potential of
increased competition as the domestic market opened up over time. In addition, PGN
was also subject to new regulatory arrangements under which gas transmission and
distribution tariffs would be set by an independent regulator.
104. The implementation of third party open access to gas networks would enable
gas suppliers to directly market gas to consumers, thereby subjecting PGN to
competitive pressures that could reduce its profit margins.
105. Opportunities arising from gas market reform included PGN being able to
significantly increase its supply and sales of gas in the West Java market, via a
combination of investments in new gas transportation infrastructure, securing new gas
supply contracts, and effective marketing of gas to large scale customers.
106. PGN's ability to take advantage of these opportunities would be supported by:
(i) the elimination of distortionary subsidies on fuel oil used by industrial customers;


                                           23
(ii) corporate restructuring and capacity building, including further sales of PGN
shares by the government to the private sector investors.
Capacity building and structural reform of PGN
107. Capacity at PGN has been improved significantly via the technical assistance
components of the project, including: (i) implementation of structural reforms at
PGN; (ii) enhance planning, operations and marketing capability; (iii) enhanced HSE
and environmental management processes and the mainstreaming of those processes
throughout PGN. These are discussed further in Annex 2.
Enhancement of Open Access regime implementation of gas pricing reforms
108. Two key market reform outcomes that the project supported were: i) the
implementation of a new Third Party Access regime for gas networks; and ii) a new
Gas Pricing framework. These reforms support improvements in the economic
efficiency of the domestic gas market by facilitating competition.
109. By the end of the project, a number of critical market reform outcomes had
been achieved. These are outlined below and discussed further in Annex 2.
110. New streamlined regulatory arrangements for Third Party Access to
transportation lines were established in 2007 and 2008 and all PGN’s gas transmission
pipelines now operate under Open Access arrangements.
111. There is limited implementation of Third Party (Open) Access on PGN's Gas
Distribution networks -- with this being restricted to national interest and government
programs.
112. Efforts to implement revisions to the existing third Party (Open) Access
arrangements for Gas Distribution Networks have stalled, together with moves to
unbundle PGN's distribution network assets. That is, the Energy & Mineral
Resources Ministry Regulation No. 19, 2009 has not been effectively implemented
because the government is still considering the matter.
113. There have some reforms to gas pricing, including: a) implementation of new
regulations concerning the calculation of gas transportation and distribution tolls; b)
increased transparency on gas prices; c) PGN shifting to regionalized and
differentiated pricing on a nationwide basis from April 1, 2010; b) PGN implementing
large increases in its selling prices to customers in West Java in 2012 and 2013
following increases to PGN's buying price of gas.
114. Further reforms to gas pricing are unlikely to be implemented until there is a
consensus of views on key aspects of the pricing framework and a political will to
scale back the range and number of special users' whose gas prices are determined by
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources. As of April 1, 2014, there appears to
remain a divergence on views between Bappenas, SKK Migas (the successor to BP
Migas), and BPH Migas on some aspects of the gas pricing regime.
115. However, the government has not abandoned the use of ministerial allocations
that specific how gas reserved for domestic supply is to be split across domestic gas
customers.
Summary
116. The project was completed on time, within budget, and with successful
implementation of all but one of the investment subprojects before the project closing



                                          24
date. That final subproject, the SCADA and Telecommunications system (IFB-4) was
commissioned into service one month after the project closing date.
117.    The technical assistance in Component 2 of the project resulted in:
        i) substantial strengthening of PGN’s capacity in targeted areas, including
           safety, planning, and gas marketing;
        ii) implementation of further structural reforms at PGN;
        iii) changes to domestic gas pricing arrangements, particularly in relation to
             the setting of regulated gas transportation and distribution tariffs, so that
             they are more transparent and based on sound economic-engineering
             principles; and
        iv) the implementation of a new Open Access regime, which has been
            effectively applied to PGN’s transmission pipelines. A central element of
            this new regime is PGN’s Pipeline System Rules.
118. The Results Framework in the Data Sheet and Annex 2 further describe the
outcomes, outputs and achievements of the two components of the project.

3.3 Efficiency

119. An ex-post economic analysis has been undertaken of the investment
Component of the project (Component 1), using the same methodology as that
employed at project appraisal. The input costs relate to the construction costs incurred
and estimated lifecycle O&M costs. The economic benefits of the the project (cash
flow from sales of gas by PGN) were estimated based on the assumption that the
economic value of gas was equal to willingness to pay for gas. Other benefits of the
project, such as energy efficiency and product quality improvement due to switching
from oil products to gas, as well as environmental benefits of substituting cleaner gas
for oil products, were not considered in the analysis.
120. The economic analysis for the project components was carried out using two
scenarios: (i) with the project; and (ii) without the project. The 'with' project scenario
includes the investment in West Java gas transmission and distribution networks,
including the linked transmission pipeline investments financed by PGN and JBIC.
The 'without' project scenario assumes that absent the project that increased volumes
of fuel oil and diesel would be used by industries in West Java.
121. For the estimation of the economic indicators, namely ERR and NPV, the
following assumptions were made for the ex-post analysis:
    •   Actual costs at the end of the project are used. The transmission
        investment costs were US$433.76 million and the distribution investment
        costs US$81.76 million. Customer conversion costs were $10.3 million.
    •   The volume of gas sales:
            o Actual data on the level of increased gas sales in the West Java area
              (SBU1) through the South Sumatera West Java 1 (SSWJ1)
              transmission pipeline has been used, covering the period 2005 to 2013.
            o For the period 2009 to 2022, it is assumed that the full 400 mmscfd
              capacity of the SSWJ1 pipeline is utilized to supply West Java (SBU1),



                                           25
               based on the fact that PGN’s contracted volumes into West Java
               exceed 400 mmscfd and that some of them must be flowing down the
               SSWJ2 pipeline. SSWJ1 was built first and only its capital costs and
               capacity are taken into account in the ex-post cost benefit analysis;
               consistent with the ex-ante cost-benefit analysis. Only later was the
               SSWJ2 pipeline built, adding another 400 mmscfd of potential
               capacity and bring the combined gas pipeline transfer capacity
               between South Sumatera and West Java up to 800 mmscfd.
               Consequently, SSWJ2 is excluded from this ex-post cost-benefit
               analysis.
           o For the period 2023 to 2025, gas volumes fall to 394 mmscfd, in line
             with PGN’s contracted gas for 2023s.
    •   Gas prices
           o The ex-post analysis uses historic data on PGN’s Average Purchase
             Price of Gas and its Average Selling Price of Gas in the period 2004 to
             2013.
           o Customers’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for gas is assumed to be equal
             to the PGN’s Average Selling Price of Gas. This WTP assumption
             affects the calculation of project benefits.
           o For the period 2014 to 2025, it is assumed that PGN’s Average
             Purchase Price of Gas remains at its 2013 level ($4.49/MMBTU) as
             does its Average Selling Price of Gas ($9.20/MMBTU).
122. The ex-post economic cost-benefit analysis indicates that the project has a
very high net benefit, valued at $2.7 billion in NPV terms with 10% discount factor.
The Economic Rate of Internal Return (EIRR) is also high at 64.5%. For details, see
Annex 3.
123. The drivers of these very strong results appear to be: (i) the substantial spread
between PGN’s Average Purchase Price of Gas and its Average Selling Price of Gas;
and (ii) the increased volumes of gas sold in West Java.
124. These very positive results vindicate the decision to proceed with the project
and point to the large potential for further economic benefits to arise from future
infrastructure investments in Indonesia's downstream gas sector.
125. No sensitivity analysis has been undertaken ex-post on how changes in key
variables might impact the ex-post economic evaluation.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

126. The project achieved its project development objective of improving economic
efficiency and reducing pollution in Indonesia by expanding the use of natural gas in
the Borrower’s domestic market. The investments made under the project have a
very positive EIRR. Improvements in gas supply infrastructure to West Java arising
from the project contributed to a dramatic increase the number of connections and
volume of gas sold, but this was complemented by upstream investments in domestic
gas fields and upgrades elsewhere the gas transmission and distribution networks. The


                                          26
overall result is measurably increased use of gas in West Java for commercial and
industrial activities, and significant reductions in annual emissions of major pollutants
and greenhouse gases arising from the switch to gas from other fossil fuels.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
127. On a project of this nature, the measurement of poverty impacts, gender
impacts and social development is both challenging and arguably unrealistic.
128. On relation to poverty reduction, the impact is likely to be minimal because
there is only are tiny numbers of both household customers (less than 90,000) and
small to medium sized commercial businesses (1709) that use piped gas, and these
two types of consumers account for only 3% of PGN’s gas sales, but account for
98.6% of PGN’s total customer numbers. Households generally use bottled LPG for
cooking, rather than reticulated gas. Approximately 97% of natural gas sold within
Indonesia is consumed by the small number large industrial customers, which account
for 1.4% of PGN’s customer numbers (see Table 1).
129. Gender and social development impacts are also difficult to quantify for the
same reasons.
130. The project, by supporting increased gas supplies to industrial customers, and
efficiency improvements in the domestic gas market, might have indirect impacts on
poverty, gender and social development through the impact it has on the prices of
energy intensive products, such as electricity, fertilizer and chemicals, public
transportation, and metals. However, to fully assess any such impacts would be a
large undertaking, involving surveys, economy-wide modelling, and detailed
simulations of how changes in prices and economic activity resulting from the
reforms impacted different types of households.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

131. The Domestic Gas Market Development Project was implemented through a
time of major institutional change in Indonesia’s gas sector, and supported through
the Second Component the project which strengthened the capabilities of PGN in
several critical business areas, including: a) Operations and Asset Integrity
Management; b) Quantitative Risk Assessment; c) Gas Transmission and Supply; and
d) Gas Marketing, Sales, and Customer relations.
132. The institutional development aspects of the Domestic Gas Market
Development project appear to have been appropriate, tailored to the needs and
priorities of PGN, and resulted in the training of key staff across PGN’s Strategic
Business Units and Management. The combination of in-country training and targeted
overseas training has contributed to the adoption of new, more commercial, practices
across PGN.
133. Component 2 of the project (Capacity Building of PGN) had three major
Intermediate Results measures: a) PGN Restructure and its financial management,
operation and planning capability strengthened; b) the design and implementation of a
new “Third Party Access” regime covering PGN’s gas transmission and distribution
networks; c) the implementation of rationalized gas pricing policy, covering both gas


                                           27
commodity pricing and the regulated tariffs for gas transmission and distribution
services.
134. In summary, the results across these three areas were mixed, with significant
progress made with the PGN’s restructuring and capacity development in the areas of
financial management, operation and planning; but limited progress made with the
implementation of a new Third Party Access regime covering PGN’s gas transmission
and distribution networks. It also appears that development and implementation of a
rationalized gas pricing policy has stalled following the implementation of initial
reforms in 2009 (Government Regulation No. 30, 2009 and Energy and Mineral
Resources Regulation No. 19, 2009). Further discussion can be found in Annex 2.

Not Applicable.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low
135. The installation of new gas transmission and distribution infrastructure in
West Java has transformed the energy supply situation there by providing new and
existing gas customers with access to significantly increased volumes of gas for
industrial, commercial and residential use. By further tapping into the vast gas
reserves of Sumatera, and providing the gas reticulation needed to get the gas to
customers, PGN has been able to provide customers in West Java with access to one
of the cheapest and cleanest fossil fuels.
136. With virtually all of the PGN’s new customers being industrial ones, it is
unlikely that they will revert to using fuel oil, diesel or coal, in part because their
factories and processes will need to be remodeled — involving considerable capital
costs — and in part because absent fuel subsidies the price of natural gas is
considerably less than alternative fossil fuels on a dollar per unit of energy basis. The
government’s 2005 removal of distortionary subsidies on fuel oil for industrial
customers appears to be irreversible, ensuring that natural gas will continue to be
assessed against alternatives on basis that reflects their true costs.
137. To sustain the PDO benefits, the ongoing challenge for PGN is to ensure
continued supplies of gas to meet the demands of its new customers. It appears that
PGN’s shift upstream into oil and gas exploration and LNG development is part of
broader strategy to secure gas supplies into the future. There remains considerable
potential for further increases in the use of natural gas instead of fuel oil —
particularly in power generation — with the associated benefits of reductions in
pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. PGN’s dramatic increase in scale, and
access to private sector financing following its partial privatization, means that it
should be well placed to finance future network capacity increases to develop and
meet currently unserved demand for gas.




                                           28
138. For Indonesia’s gas market to develop further, additional efforts are needed to
consolidate and improve the gas Third Party Access Regime and the Gas Pricing
arrangements. In addition, broader reforms are required to encourage investment in
the development of gas for domestic consumption; particularly now given that
Indonesia is a net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products and the
government is severely constrained in its ability to subsidize petroleum fuel prices.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
139. The Bank’s performance in project identification, preparation and appraisal is
rated moderately satisfactory.
140. The design of the project effectively accounted for structural changes in
Indonesia’ domestic gas market and sought to address critical issues of strategic
importance: (i) increasing use of Indonesia’s abundant natural gas resources to meet
growing energy demands; (ii) providing access to cleaner fossil fuels with lower
pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions; (iii) creating conditions conducive to
further investment in the domestic gas market by providing greater clarity around
Third Party Access arrangements, Gas Pricing, and the setting of regulated Gas
Transmission and Distribution tariffs.
141. The implementation arrangements were suitable, with the PIU supported by a
PMC, a TPI, and overseen by a Procurement Committee reporting to PGN’s senior
management and Board.
142. The project’s design was focused, ready for rapid-start up and could be
effectively implemented in the West Java, one of the most densely populated areas of
Indonesia.
143. From a technical, financial and economic perspective, the investment
subprojects were sound — targeting the largest gas consumption area of West Java;
leveraging off the increased gas supplies coming from the linked SSWJ transmission
pipeline project that PGN financed with JBIC; and being built to international safety
standards.
144. However, for a variety of reasons discussed in Section 2.1 above, the project
preparation was protracted – with nearly two and half years between project
conception and final approval.
145. In addition, with the benefit of hindsight, it is open to question whether in
preparing the project the Bank was able to engage as effectively as would have been
desirable with some key stakeholders, in particular: (i) the downstream gas regulator,
BPH Migas; (ii) BP Migas (the gas upstream regulator, now called SKK Migas); (iii)
DG Migas (Directorate General, Oil & Gas); and (iv) Bappenas (State Planning
Ministry).     The modality of using a market reform project that was primarily
implemented through the dominant downstream gas supplier, PGN, could at times
have led to perceptions that some of the recommended reforms to gas pricing and
open access arrangements, which arose from the project’s technical assistance
component, might have favored PGN. The partial implementation of gas sector


                                         29
pricing reforms, the continued use of government intervention in the allocation of gas
to specific industries and its price, and the increasing degree of vertical integration in
the gas sector are all indicators that some of the project’s key reform objectives did
not gain full support across government. Nonetheless, significant the structural,
regulatory and pricing reforms supported by the project did gain traction, with the
reforms actually made being substantial steps along the road to improved efficiency in
Indonesia’s gas and energy markets.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
146.   The Bank’s supervision of this project was moderately satisfactory.
147. The project implementation performance assessments, as reflected in ISRs,
Management letters, and Aide Memoires, provided a realistic overview the project
throughout project implementation. The reporting of the project’s investment
component appears to be timely and relevant, and the Bank’s reporting of changes in
PGN’s financial performance and efforts to contract new gas supplies was very good.
148. While there were some implementation difficulties, the Bank team was pro-
active in its supervision and implementation support to help identify and address the
issues emerged. For example, in 2006 the Bank worked effectively with PGN’s
newly appointed PMC to prepare terms of reference and evaluate proposals for key
procurement packages. Following that intervention, the PMC gained confidence and
competence in managing procurements in line with Bank procedures.
149. The Bank missed the opportunity to formally restructure the project after there
were significant changes in Component 1 of the project. Instead, $18.2 million from
the loan was cancelled. In missing to formally restructure the project, the Bank also
missed the opportunity to revise the PDO in the PAD consistent with the PDO in the
Loan Agreement.
150. However, one important area of weakness in the Bank’s supervision appears to
be an inadequate level of reporting on developments in the critically important areas
of: (i) gas policy and regulatory reforms; (ii) implementation of changes to the gas
pricing methodology used by BPH Migas; (iii) reforms to the Open Access Regime;
and (iv) further structural reforms and unbundling of PGN. These were all part of
Component 2 of the project. The project’s ISRs do not provide information on
Intermediate Outcome Indicators relating to Component 2 of the project, and as such
there was little reported information on the outputs and outcomes of this important
area of the project.
151. Towards the very end of the project, the Bank took steps to engage more
effectively with a broad spectrum of stakeholders on issues relating to the efficacy of
gas market reforms made so far and the need for further reforms. That was done
through a separate technical assistance project (the Gas Development Master Plan
(P129639)), which was completed in December 2013 – see Annex 3 for details.
152. Importantly, if the Bank team had very early-on made clear that the SCADA
system and telecommunications systems specifications must have an open
architecture that supported Third Party Open Access, some of the delays arising from
the re-specification and re-tendering of those packages could have been avoided.
Delays arising from the SCADA and telecommunications system re-specification, re-


                                           30
design, tendering and construction and commissioning ultimately led to a 36 month
extension in the project’s closing date. The understanding of the importance of open
architecture that supported Third Party Open Access might have been lost as a result
of changes in the composition and skill sets of the Bank’s project team, both between
project preparation and supervision and across the supervision period.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
153. The Bank responded to client requests in a timely manner and provided
suitable advice on how to adapt to changes and address challenges that arose over
time. Proactive engagement with the implementing agency helped to reinforce
safeguards, procurement and fiduciary controls.
154. However, there appear to be weaknesses in the Bank’s supervision as it related
to engagement with and oversight of the implementation of important reforms to the
open access regime and gas pricing.
155. While strong early efforts were made to support PGN in hiring an individual
consultant to advice on open access regime and gas pricing, the supervision reports of
the Bank do not adequately report on how, whether, and to what extent the reforms
recommended were actually implemented by government and the regulator and on the
strategic policy consequences arising from the reforms or the lack of reforms.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


156. There was generally strong government commitment to the project investment
components, which contributed to the timely completion of the project.               The
government commitment and actions were probably much more critical to this project
than most, as the underlying regulatory, legal, pricing structure and policies set by the
government were indispensable to achieving the objectives.
157. The government has also demonstrated strong commitment to broader gas
market reform and commercialization aspects of the project. The government has
implemented some of the project’s recommended reforms to gas pricing, supported
the development and implementation of a new Third Party Access regime for gas
transmission. By 2013, the government had further divested shares in PGN, with the
public holding 43.03% of PGN’s issued shares and the government 56.97%.
158. However, the GoI’s protracted budgetary process in 2009 put pressure on the
project’s delivery, with disbursements in that year only being 17% of what was
envisaged. The slow disbursement rate in 2009 arose from the protracted delays in
approval of the Indonesian budget, which held up approval of the project’s 2009
Supplementary Loan Agreement budget until late in the year. Once the 2009
Supplementary Loan Agreement budget was approved, disbursements re-commenced
on December 4, 2009.
159. The Indonesia-specific requirement that parliament reviews the annual budget
of each donor-sponsored project creates challenges for effective and timely project


                                           31
implementation. The removal of this parliamentary review requirement, if at all
possible, would help to streamline project implementation while still allowing public
accountability to be maintained via regular project performance reports, annual
project audits, and annual financial statements from the Implementing Agency.
160. The government’s decision to cancel over 20% of the loan meant that PGN
had to finance a larger share of the investments under the project using its own
financial resources or with financing with a higher cost than the IBRD loan. This had
no impact on the delivery and outcomes of the project because PGN was more than
capable of increasing its contribution to the project, since over time its financial
strength increased. It is understood that the GoI’s partially cancel the loan was made
taking into consideration broader issues regarding the government’s overall debt
levels and with regard to PGN’s growing corporate strength as a partially privatized
gas utility.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

161. Despite an initial delay of 1 year, PGN was able to commission into service all
the gas transmission and distribution infrastructure before the closure of the project —
apart from the SCADA and Telecommunications package, which was commissioned
in November 2013, one month after the project’s closure.
162. In addition, PGN was able benefit from the implementation and outcomes
arising from the capacity building component of the project, including: (i)
improvements to gas safety, system planning, and the project management of large
infrastructure projects; (ii) gas system management and SCADA system
implementation; (iii) greater transparency in the regulatory setting of gas
transportation and distribution tolls; (iv) improvements in gas marketing; and (v) an
improved Open Access regime.
163. PGN appears to have played a positive and effective role in convincing other
important stakeholders, including BPH Migas and gas shippers and customers, of the
merits of its Pipeline System Rules, which are a central part of the new Open Access
regime.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Based on the GOI’s and the implementing agency’s performance to achieving the
project objectives, overall Borrower’s performance is rated moderately satisfactory.


6. Lessons Learned

   a) Regulatory and policy reforms are critical to market transformation
       •   In implementing a market reform project like this one, the supervision of
           the project needs to pay as much attention to fundamental policy,



                                          32
        regulatory and pricing reforms as it does to the delivery and
        commissioning of physical infrastructure and its impacts.
    •   Further development of Indonesia’s domestic gas market depends critically
        on implementation of an effective regulatory regime, with incremental
        improvement to Indonesia’s sound Third Party Access Regime and major
        changes to the domestic gas pricing and gas allocation arrangements.
    •   Significant changes to both these areas were proposed and partially
        implemented during the course of the project, based on the technical
        assistance provided by this project and the earlier Java-Bali Power Project.
    •   It appears that the momentum for further major gas market policy and
        regulatory reforms stalled between 2009 and 2012. Reform momentum
        needs to be reinvigorated by clear policy guidance from government and
        with the implementation of further reforms that create an enabling
        environment for increased private sector investment. There are promising
        signs this is now happening, following additional and more effective gas
        policy engagement by the Bank with the government during 2013.

b) Benefits of probity and transparency around procurement
    •   The publication of contract award information can greatly contribute to
        improving perceptions of Indonesia’s endemic corruption; especially when
        this forms part of a broader Anti-Corruption Plan.
    •   PGN discovered this to be the case after it published in April 2007
        information on contracts awarded during 2006 and early 2007.
    •   A positive benefit arising from improved confidence in the probity and
        transparency of procurement is that well qualified, genuine bidders will be
        more likely to submit proposals, thereby increasing the effective level of
        competition for goods, works, and services.

c) Careful specification of complex market related infrastructure, such as the
SCADA system, needs to take into account how that infrastructure will be
used in the evolving market.
•   There should have been much greater clarity from the start that the SCADA
    system and telecommunications systems specifications needed to have an open
    architecture that supported Third Party Open Access, rather than a proprietary
    architecture more suited to system monitoring and control by a gas pipeline
    owner operating without Third Party Open Access to its networks.
•   If there had been that clarity, the bulk of the project’s delays arising from the
    re-specification and re-tendering of the SCADA system and
    telecommunications packages could have been avoided.
•   The understanding of the importance of open architecture that supported Third
    Party Open Access might have been lost as a result of changes in the
    composition and skill sets (especially, micro-economists, engineers, and IT
    professionals) of both the Bank and client’s project teams, both between
    project preparation and supervision and across the supervision period.
    Alternatively, there might have been inadequate communications between


                                       33
       various disciplines on why open architecture was needed and what was
       required to implement it.

Note: In some places the PAD included physical contingencies, price contingencies, and value-added
tax as part of Component 1 (with a total cost of $108.5 million), and in others they were listed as
separate line items. Interest was consistently treated as a distinct cost at appraisal.

Note: Project beneficiaries (private companies/industries converting to gas from other fuels) also
invested considerable amounts, including some costs that were originally expected to be covered by the
Bank loan or PGN (i.e., installation of project-financed metering and regulating stations). The
conversion-related costs borne by the companies were not systematically estimated at appraisal or
recorded during implementation

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

The project consisted of 17 packages, of which 16 packages were financed by the
Bank: 12 for the procurement of goods, works and non-consulting services; and 4 for
consultant services. The 17th package (IFB-8, Branch lines in Greater Jakarta and
Karawang) was funded by PGN.

IFB-1: Banten distribution mainline. The Banten distribution mainline was
commissioned into service on 18 November 2008, approximately 1 year than
originally scheduled under the contract. A total length of 36,348 meters of 16”
diameter pipeline was laid, in accordance with six amendments to the original
contract. The contract for the Banten distribution mainline originally planned for
41,950 meters of 16” diameter pipeline was to be installed, but during implementation
changes in the routing of the pipeline reduced the length of pipe installed by 5.6 km
(or 13.3%) from that originally planned.

IFB-2: Greater Jakarta Distribution Mainline. Similar to the Banten Distribution
Mainline, the Greater Jakarta Distribution Mainline experienced some delays in
construction. The EPC contract for the Greater Jakarta Distribution Mainline
envisaged that 60,089 meters of 10” to 16” diameter pipes would be laid within a year
(19 Dec 2006 to 25 Nov 2007). That ambitious timetable for construction had to be
extended by two years to 5 January 2010. Changes in the routing of the Jakarta
distribution mainline meant its final as built length was 58,686 meters (97.7% of that
originally contracted).

IFB-3: Off-take stations and Regulation Stations. Five Offtake Stations were built:
Cikande, Cimanggis, Walahar, Bitung 2, and Bitung 3. Two Regulation Stations were
constructed: one at Bitung 2 and the other at Cikupa. The location of one of the off-
take stations changed during the course of project implementation. Specifically, the
originally planned Serpong off-take station was replaced by an extra off-take station
at Bitung (Bitung 3) due to difficulties in securing suitable land at Serpong. The
completion of IFB-3 on 12 February 2010 was around 12 months later than originally
set out in the contract (10 January 2008 to 23 Jan 2009).

IFB-4: SCADA and telecommunication.                 The complex SCADA and
Telecommunications package (IFB-4) underwent significant changes in its design
specification that prompted a 36 month extension to the closing date of the project to
March 31, 2013. In order to accommodate an open access system and improve
reliability by having a second, back-up, Master Control Station, the design and
bidding documentation for SCADA were altered from those originally drawn up by
PGN. The SCADA system enables the system operator to monitor and control the
flow and pressure of gas across the West Java Distribution Network via
telecommunications signals sent from a Master Control Station. This assists PGN
with system control and security, gas metering, and financial transaction settlements.
The SCADA system comprises: 1 Master Control Station (MCS), 1 Back-up Master
Control Station (BMCS), 10 Offtake stations, 20 Big Customers, 7 District Offices,
the existing SCADA system for the SSWJ transmission connection (SSWJ SCADA
system), 10 Automatic Meter Readers (AMR), 25 Pressure Monitoring Devices
(PMD), and 2 OPC (Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control) Tunneling.
Installation of the SCADA system commenced in July 2011, shortly after the contract
was awarded. From January 2013, PGN took over the funding of IFB-4 from the
World Bank. By November 2013, the whole SCADA and Telecommunications
system had been installed and commissioned into service.

IFB-5 and IFB-5A: Procurement of pipes for service lines. A total of 125.5 km of
pipes between 4” and 10” diameter were acquired under IFB-5 (99km) and IFB-5A
(26.5 km). The IFB-5 pipes were delivered between October 2006 and January 2007
and the supplementary order of IFB-5A pipes delivered between September and
November 2007. These pipes were used in the construction of branch lines and for
customer connections. The additional service pipes ordered under IFB-5A were
required to meet increased customer demand for connections, arising from the new
branch lines in the Greater Jakarta and Karawang area (IFB-8B).

IFB-6A: Metering and regulating stations (Banten customers). The 88 MRS for
customers in the Banten area were delivered between June and July 2007, after the
contract was signed on 26 December 2006.

IFB-6b: Metering and regulating stations (Greater Jakarta and Karawang
customers). A total of 164 MRS were procured for customers in the Greater Jakarta
and Karawang area. The MRS units were delivered between Nov 2006 and March
2008. The contract was closed on 3 May 2009 following the expiry of the warranty
period.

IFB-7: Special O&M tools and equipment. The procurement of special O&M Tools
and Equipment was protracted, taking until June 2011 to complete. Part of the reason
this package took a long time to tender and complete was that the specification of
various tools and equipment required extensive consultations with PGN staff in SBUs,
Operations, and mobile emergency units. A mixture of ICB and Shopping was used
to procure the various lots of tools and equipment: ICB was used for IFB-7A (Special
Tools for Operation and Maintenance); while Shopping was used for IFB-S7A (HSE
Equipment and tools), IFB-S7B (Pipeline and Facility Tools), and IFB-S7C (SCADA
and Communication Tools).




                                         38
IFB-8A: Branch lines (Banten). The 26 branch lines around Banten, under IFB-8A,
were completed by 31 October 2009, with minor outstanding works completed during
the subsequent 12 month defect liability period.

IFB-8B: Branch lines (Greater Jakarta and Karawang). Early during project
implementation PGN decided to use its own funds to rapidly build branch lines in the
Greater Jakarta and Karawang area (IFB-8B) in order to expedite the connection of
new customers. The branch lines for Greater Jakarta and Karawang (IFB-8B) were
completed by September 2009.

IFB-9A: Customer connections for Banten. The installation of MRS and customer
connections for all 35 new customers around Banten was completed by 12 June 2009,
with minor outstanding works completed during the subsequent 12 month defect
liability period.

IFB-9B: Customer connections for Greater Jakarta and Karawang.                  The
installation of MRS and customer connections for all 25 new customers in the Greater
Jakarta and Karawang area was completed by 31 June 2009, with minor outstanding
works completed during the subsequent 12 month defect liability period.

Project Management Consultant (PMC). The PMC contract was an integral part of
PGN’s effective delivery of the project. The contract was signed on February 10,
2006, following a QCBS selection process being followed in the lead up to project
being approved by the World Bank Board. The PMC assisted PGN across a range of
preparatory matters – including field surveys, preliminary engineering, and



                                                   39
preparation of bidding documents – and project management matters, such as contract
supervision, schedule changes, and quality assurance.

The Long Term Technical Collaboration Services (LTCS) contract was signed in
May 2006. The consortium that won the PMC contract was also awarded the LTCS
contract. The objective of the LTCS contract was to strengthen PGN’s capability in
planning and operating the gas distribution system by providing: (i) seconded
technical experts; (ii) training and assessment of staff; (iii) consultancy services; and
(iv) advising on and transferring technology to PGN.

The LTSC contract focused on seven key areas:
   1. Engineering and planning;
   2. Operations and Integrity Management System;
   3. Quantitative Risk Assessment;
   4. Gas Transmission;
   5. Review of IT requirements;
   6. Risk Management Review; and
   7. Training.

By the Mid Term Review in June 2010, implementation of the LTCS contract was
complete; with the exception of the reviews of Risk Management and IT
Requirements, both of which were dropped. That was in line with the plan outlined in
the inception report of the LTCS consultants.

      •     Risk Management was excluded from the final scope of work after the
            consultant’s inception report found that PGN’s Risk Management Department
            had already initiated its own work on this topic due to delays in the
            procurement process for the LTCS contract.

      •     The consultant’s Review of IT Requirements was restricted to: (i) diagnostic
            analysis of PGN’s IT system; (ii) providing assistance in designing an IT
            system that would cover all aspects of the gas business. Tasks related to
            procurement and implementation of a new IT system were dropped from the
            contract. PGN replaced these tasks with other technical services using its own
            resources to fund further IT related work (design of an IT Master Plan and
            related activities).

Gas Pricing Framework and Third Party Access

The project sought to make fundamental reforms to Indonesia’s: (i) the Third Party
Access arrangements for gas transmission and distribution; and (ii) gas pricing
framework.

The implementation of these two particular reforms was one of the main rationales for
the project, and considered essential to: improving the efficiency of gas utilization,
increasing transparency of gas supply chain costs, unbundling the gas sector, and
creating a more attractive environment for increased private sector investment in the
supply and utilization of natural gas. As such, these reforms were key pillars to giving
effect to the policy objectives in the Oil and Natural Gas Law 2001 and Government
Regulation 36/2004 (Oil and Gas Downstream).

The project financed technical assistance to advise PGN on the Third Party Access
arrangements and gas pricing framework. PGN awarded a contract to an individual
international consultant in March 2006. The consultant advised PGN on gas pricing
issues and methodology and open access arrangements for its gas transmission and
distribution networks. The work of this individual consultant built on and distilled
other consultancy work prepared as TA under Loan 4712-IND (Java-Bali Power
Restructuring and Strengthening Project); specifically: (i) Gas Pricing and Utilization
Study; 3 (ii) PGN Restructuring and Privatization Study. 4

The individual consultant delivered three inter-related reports: (A) Indonesian Gas
Structure Industry Issues; 5 (B) Third Party Access to Indonesian Gas Networks; 6 and
(C) Gas Pricing Framework and Methodology and Implementation Rules for
Transmission and Distribution Tariffs. 7

These three reports provided PGN, the regulator BPH Migas, and the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources with concise summaries of existing regulatory
arrangements, the range of reform options available, and recommendations on how to
effectively implement significant reforms to gas pricing and third party access
arrangements.

The findings and recommendations of each report are briefly summarized below,
before an assessment of is made of the extent to which the recommended reforms
were implemented, the outcomes arising from the reforms made, the scope for further
reform efforts in these areas and the possibility of future Bank involvement with those
efforts.

I. What further gas market reforms were recommended?

A. Indonesian Gas Structure Industry Issues

As well as implementing new arrangements for Open Access and Gas Pricing, five
other key issues in Indonesia’s gas sector were identified as requiring further
attention:
     1. Avoiding increased vertical integration and reduced competition;
     2. Safety Standards in Gas Transmission and Distribution;
     3. Allocations;
     4. Destination Clauses in Gas Supply Agreements; and
     5. Support for Regulator.

I. Avoiding increased vertical integration and reduced competition

After reviewing Indonesia’s gas market reforms, Third Party Access arrangements,
gas pricing framework, and regulatory regime (as it stood in early 2007), a critical risk
was identified: the “danger that the reforms may actually lead to increasing vertical
integration and reducing competition.” 8 Producers (either directly or through
subsidiaries or affiliates) could have incentives to build their own transportation and
own distribution networks and have their own trading company selling gas directly to
consumers. This danger was seen as arising from two things. First, there being
insufficient separation of gas transportation and trading under Indonesia’s gas laws
regulations, which allowed a corporate body with either a transport or trading license
to obtain a Special Right for transport or distribution. That is, it was possible for a
trading company to build and operate a gas transport pipeline, and for a transporter to
act as a trader. In these circumstances, the gas producer’s own transport pipeline
could be used deny access to any third party by a range of complex means. Second,
the regulations requiring open access to be negotiated were silent on what would
happen if the parties failed to agree on terms for access. “The result of these two
things may be that gas market players are encouraged to integrate vertically and there
is little in the regulation to stop that happening.” 9

                                           43
To mitigate the danger of vertical integration and reduced competition, four sets of
reforms to the regulatory regime were recommended:

   1. Separation of Transport and Trading. Introduce a regulation clarifying that
      high pressure transmission operators (or any affiliate or subsidiary) may not
      engage in trading, and traders (or any affiliate or subsidiary) may not have any
      high pressure transmission activity. This excludes the distribution level
      (where it is normal to have a period of exclusivity and combined distribution
      and trading/supply for a time).

   2. Transparency across the Gas Chain, with regulations implemented to oblige
      transparency and disclosure of information by gas producers, transporters,
      distributors and traders.

   3. Separate Pricing at Each Point of the Gas Chain:
          a. Price disclosure at all levels of the gas chain;
          b. Publication of contract prices, even in unregulated segments of the
             market where gas companies may freely negotiate prices with
             consumers.       In particular, it was recommended that there be
             publication of: (i) All contract prices from producers to traders; (ii)
             Maximum prices from traders to consumers; (iii) Transmission tariffs
             to all traders; (iv) Distribution tariffs (where there is distribution open
             access) or the maximum distribution margin (where there is not yet
             distribution open access).
   4. Regulated Open Access and Pipeline System Rules.
          a. Implement regulated open access, with the transporters and traders
             (shippers) to negotiate and agree on the Pipeline System Rules between
             themselves, and then submit them to the regulator (BPH Migas) for
             approval. In assessing whether to approve the negotiated Pipeline
             System Rules, the regulator should have regard to: (i) Frequency of the
             commercial balancing regime; (ii) The opportunities for new shippers
             to gain access to capacity; (iii) The opportunities to stay in balance;
             and (iv) Non-discrimination of the balancing regime.
          b. Transparency: Make the Pipeline System Rules freely available to any
             trader (shipper) who is considering using the pipeline.

II. Safety Standards in Gas Transmission and Distribution

       To improve the safety and security of the gas sector in Indonesia, as clearly
       intended under the law and regulations, it was recommended that a philosophy
       and culture of safety be built into gas industry practice (if it is not already
       there).

       Three recommendations were made to strengthen gas safety and security in
       Indonesia:
          1. Technical standards for gas transmission and distribution be
             independently regulated and aligned to international standards;

           2. Laws be reformed to assign legal liability for unsafe practices and gas
              incidents to both gas corporations and the individual directors of gas
              corporations, with penalties to include significant fines and
              imprisonment; and
           3. The regulator’s decision to a grant license to either a gas transmission
              or a gas distribution company should take into account the proven
              experience in safe gas installation by: the gas company itself, its
              competent staff, its competent subcontractors, or a competent affiliate
              company or partner.

III. Allocations

In the past BP Migas sometimes issued instructions on how gas was to be allocated by
gas producers to various sectors (e.g. 50% to PLN, 40% to PGN and 10% to others),
but such practices are generally considered to be anti-competitive and have been
abandoned in many countries that formerly used them (including communist
countries).

Indonesian law obliges 25% of gas production to be assigned to domestic use, but is
silent on where that 25% of gas production should go. A law and policy of retaining a
share of gas for domestic use is common in countries with small but developing gas
markets and large export volumes. However, how exactly that domestic share of gas
is split among various gas users is left to the market (through supply, demand and
price) rather than via allocations by regulation or ministerial decree.

It was recommended that with Indonesia’s shift to a competitive gas market, the
allocation of gas to particular domestic users should be decided by the market, and not
through regulation or ministerial decree.

IV. Destination Clauses in Gas Supply Agreements

Another recommendation was that clauses in Gas Supply Agreements that restrict the
sale of gas to certain specified geographic areas (i.e. so called Destination Clauses) be
declared illegal and abolished because they are considered anti-competitive. The
abolition of destination clauses, together with increase transparency and publication
of location specific gas prices, are two ways of promoting competition and efficiency.

V. Support of the Regulator. It was recommended that the regulator (BPH Migas) be
supported and empowered so that it could properly and effectively regulate the
downstream gas industry.

B. Third Party Access to Indonesian Gas Networks

Following the passing of the Oil and Natural Gas Law 2001 (Law 22), the regulatory
regime for open [i.e. third party] access was partially developed through Government
Regulations and BPH Migas Regulations; in particular:
   •   Government Regulation No. 36/2004 – Oil and Gas Downstream;
   •   Elucidation of Government Regulation No. 36/2004;



                                           45
   •   BPH Migas Regulation No. 1, “Guidelines of Special Rights for Transport of
       Natural Gas through Transmission Pipelines”, BPH Migas, Jakarta, 10
       December 2004;
   •   BPH Migas Regulation No. 2, “Guidelines of Special Rights for Transport of
       Natural Gas through Distribution Pipelines”, BPH Migas, Jakarta, 10
       December 2004.

Several aspects of a gas Open Access regime were already established in Indonesian
law and regulation in 2007; specifically:
   •       There was a requirement for open access for both to transportation and
           distribution pipes;
   •       The transport and distribution business was to be regulated to the extent
           that there was open access;
   •       Existing users and the pipeline owner were not to suffer from the open
           access and a user of open access was required to pay the owner of the
           transport or distribution pipeline;
   •       A distribution company had an exclusive right to build distribution
           networks within its distribution area for 25 years, providing it conformed
           with the development plan and there was sufficient capacity to allow open
           access;
   •       It was possible to extend the Special Right time period.


However, other key aspects of the Open Access regulatory regime required further
development or clarification, in particular:
   1. The Pipeline System Rules necessary to give effect to an Open Access
      Regime;
   2. The clear separation of responsibilities between traders and transporters, with:
           a. The transporter being responsible for physical balancing; and
           b. Traders being responsible for commercial balancing;
   3. A regular commercial balancing regime;
   4. Commercial incentives for traders to stay in balance.


For each issue in turn, the existing regulation in 2007, plus recommendations for an
improved open access framework are summarized in Table A2.4.

C. Gas Pricing Framework & Transmission and Distribution Tariffs

As with Third Party Access, by early 2007 Indonesia already had in place significant
regulations regarding gas pricing and gas network tariffs, arising from the Oil and
Natural Gas Law 2001, Government Regulations and BPH Migas Regulations.
Specifically:
• Oil and Natural Gas Law 2001;
• Government Regulation No. 36/2004 – Oil and Gas Downstream;
• Elucidation of Government Regulation No. 36/2004;
• BPH Migas Regulation No. 4, “Guidelines to Determine Transportation Tariffs”,
  BPH Migas, Jakarta, 7 February 2005;
• BPH Migas Regulation No. 3, “Guidelines to Determine Tariffs for Households
  and Small-Scale Consumers”, BPH Migas, Jakarta, 7 February 2005.



                                           48
However, further reforms to the gas pricing framework and gas network tariffs were
recommended.

Existing Gas Pricing Framework (May 2007)

The gas pricing policy in Indonesian law and regulation in early 2007 covered the
following:
1. Prices to consumers are to be according to “a fair, healthy, and transparent
   competition” (Government Regulation No. 36/2004, Article 72);
2. Tariffs for transportation shall be regulated by BPH Migas. Several components
   of that tariff regulation were set out in BPH Migas Guidelines;
3. Prices to Household and small-scale customers shall be regulated by BPH Migas
   according to technical-economical principles (of cost recovery) but also reflect
   Government policies. Several components of that tariff regulation were set out in
   BPH Migas Guidelines;
4. In setting the tariffs, BPH Migas must pay attention to the interest of all the parties
   involved: gas owners, pipeline companies and consumers (explanation to
   Government Regulation 36/2004, Article 9, Clause c).
In summary, the Gas Pricing Framework that existed in 2007 had the following
elements:
• Tariff setting powers: The company proposes tariffs and the calculations, and they
   are then reviewed and approved by the regulator;
• Tariff policy:
       o Regulated tariffs: Transport (including distribution), plus households and
           small-scale consumers;
       o Unregulated tariffs: All others
• Components of the gas chain:
       o Production: Unregulated;
       o Transport: Regulated
       o Sales:
                Industry – unregulated
                Households and small-scale consumers - regulated

Recommended changes to Gas Pricing Framework

The following recommendations were made to change Indonesia’s 2007 gas pricing
framework:
• Separate pricing and costing for each part of the gas chain (production including
    processing, transmission, distribution, sales);
• Distribution
       o A bundled final price of the Distribution and Sales Charge (use of
           distribution pipes plus sales);
       o Pass through of all other costs;
• Cost reflective tariffs for households and small-scale consumers, gas companies
    should not have to subsidise these consumers;
• Cost of Service methodology for regulated tariffs;




                                           49
•   The Regulator needs to define how and if the CPI-X formula for regulated
    household and small-scale consumers will be applied.
•   Published tariffs at all levels (production, transport, sales);
•   Tariff review periods;
       o Transport and distribution – every three years;
       o Sales to household consumers – every three years;
       o Sales to large-scale consumers – when necessary;
•   Automatic price adjustments
       o Sales to large-scale consumers – monthly or quarterly;
       o Sales to household consumers – annual;
       o Automatic pass through of:
                 Gas cost;
                 Transport cost;
                 Non gas costs.

Existing Framework for Regulation for Gas Network Tariffs (May 2007)

•   Depreciation – straight line;
•   Asset lives
       o Economic life; or
       o Period of security of the gas supply;
•   Asset valuation –by a valuation company (therefore current cost);
•   Rate of Return – IRR;
•   Transportation and distribution tariffs
       o Postage; or
       o Distance.

Recommended changes to Gas Network Tariff Regulatory Framework

The following recommendations were made to change the regulatory framework for
establishing gas transmission and distribution network tariffs:

    •   Design principles – Cost of Service approach;
    •   Cost calculation – forecast costs;
    •   Operating costs
           o Forecast actual costs;
           o Other costs passed through;
           o Unaccounted for gas:
                     Recovered through the balancing regime where there is one; or
                     Tariffs where there is not yet open access;
    •   Asset lives – 20 years;
    •   Transportation tariffs – zonal;
    •   Distribution tariffs – postage.

For each area and issue in turn, the existing regulation plus recommendations for a
revised framework and transmission and distribution tariffs are summarized in Table
A2.5.

downstream Gas Pricing is available at the BHP Migas website. 10

Four of the key new reform instruments are summarized below.
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 19/2009
   • Sets the structure of natural gas trading, transmission and distribution business
       and licensing.
   • Provides special rights and licensing for dedicated downstream.
   • The price setting authority and mechanism for piped natural gas differs by
       customer class:
           o Residential gas customers’ prices are regulated by BPH Migas.
           o Special users’ are subsidized industries whose gas prices are
               determined by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.
           o General users’ gas prices are determined by gas companies and reflect
               market forces. General users consist of non-subsidized industries and
               power plants.
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 3/2010
       •    Upstream has a mandate to serve domestic demand by 25% of natural gas
            production.
       •    Domestic gas utilization priorities for national oil and gas production,
            fertilizer, electricity and industrial uses.
       •    Exemption for existing Gas Sales & Purchase Agreements, Heads of
            Agreement, Memoranda of Understanding or negotiations in progress.

Government Regulation No. 30/2009
       •    Amended Government Regulation No. 36/2004 by changing its clause 72 from
            stating that “the prices of oil and gas, except gas for residential and small
            customers, are to be determined by a healthy, normal and transparent business
            competition” to stating “ the price of fuel and gas is to be
            regulated/determined by Government”.
       •    GR 30/2009 was one reaction to critics of gas market liberalization and
            concerns that the reforms were in contravention of the Indonesian Constitution
            clause that states “commodities and natural resources are important to the
            welfare of the people and controlled by the state”.
Master Plan for Gas Transmission and Distribution
       •    The development and regular updating of the National Gas Network Master
            Plan is a requirement stipulated in Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources
            Decree on Gas Master Plan (MESDM No. 1321/2005).
       •    The current Gas Network Master Plan, covering 2012 to 2025, was issued on
            September 6, 2012 (Keputusan Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral, No.
            2700 K/11/MEM/2012). 11

       •    The Master Plan maps gas fields, pipelines, power plants, major industrial gas
            consumption centers, gas monitoring stations, refineries, LNG plants, and gas
            supply franchise areas. Tabulated information is also provided on pipeline
            diameters, lengths, pipeline capacities and pipeline utilization.
       •    Importantly, the Master Plan provides specific information on the access
            arrangement by type of pipeline (gas transportation or distribution), for both
            existing and planned pipelines.

     Self use


       •    It is evident that a significant number of new gas pipelines are planned, many
            of which notionally will have open access arrangements, as required under
            Government Regulation 36/2004 and BPH Migas Regulation No.12/2008.
            However, if a planned new pipeline’s capacity is fully utilized under the
            related foundation Gas Transportation Agreement, the existence of an open
            access regime on the pipeline will be largely irrelevant because third parties
            will have limited opportunity to actually ship gas through the new pipeline.

Reforms to the Open Access regime

During the project implementation period, two significant reforms to the gas network
open access arrangements were: (i) the development of PGN’s Pipeline System Rules
and their approval by the regulator; and (ii) refinements to regulations concerning
Special Rights that are designed to encourage further development of new open access
transmission pipelines and open access gas distribution areas. 12

Since the development of the Pipeline System Rules was a key recommendation of
the project’s technical assistance in 2007, it is discussed further.


PGN Pipeline System Rules 2007
       •    PGN’s Pipeline System Rules (“the Rules”) provide the general terms and
            conditions relating to Third Party Access to PGN’s gas transportation
            networks. The Rules provide a detailed framework for gas transportation,
            nominations, allocation, attribution, measurement and stock transfer that apply
            to each Shipper who seeks to move gas through the Pipeline System.

     Special Right Auction of Gas Pipeline: BPH Migas Regulation No.12/BPH Migas/II/2008.




                                                      56
   •   The Rules must be obeyed by both Transporter (PGN) and Shippers. In the
       event of any inconsistency between the Rules and any Gas Transportation
       Agreement between the Shipper and Transporter, the provisions of the Rules
       prevail (Clause 34 of Rules).

   •   Key parts of the Pipeline System Rules are: (1) Operating philosophy for the
       pipeline; (2) Obligation on the transporter to operate on an Open Access Basis;
       (3) Gas management system; (3) Technical Rules, including on gas quality and
       safety standards; and (4) Legal and Miscellaneous Rules, including dispute
       resolution.
   •   The Pipeline System Rules were developed by PGN in consultation with gas
       Shippers and other interested parties, and submitted to the downstream gas
       sector regulator BPH Migas for approval.
   •   The Rules were approved by by BPH Migas and now form a critical part of
       the Indonesia Open Access Arrangement for gas transportation pipelines.

Reforms to gas pricing

1. Gas commodity pricing
   •   Some reforms to domestic gas commodity pricing were made after the
       publication of Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Decree No. 19/2009.
   •   It appears that many of the pricing reforms recommended in 2007, as part of
       the project’s technical assistance, have been implemented.        Specifically:
       geographically divergent gas prices are now set; there is greater transparency
       on what makes up end user gas prices; and there is greater transparency on the
       setting of gas pipeline tariffs.
   •   The Government of Indonesia continues to play a dominant role in setting
       domestic gas prices and in allocating that gas among competing uses. The
       total volume of Indonesia’s domestic gas supplies is still heavily influenced
       by: upstream Production Sharing Contracts; the government’s policy that 25%
       of gas produced in Indonesia be allocated to domestic usage; the opportunity
       costs of LNG exports; gas infrastructure constraints; government decisions on
       how domestic gas is allocated among various users; and government decisions
       on which users receive subsidized gas prices. In addition, the continued
       subsidization of fuel oil, diesel, coal and other fossil fuels for certain
       consumers is likely constraining further development of Indonesia’s domestic
       gas market.
   •   Consequently, Indonesia remains in a situation of underlying domestic gas
       demand being unmet due to a lack of sufficient gas supply coming to market.
       While there have been dramatic changes to Indonesia’s domestic gas
       consumption – arising from the reductions in fuel subsidies in 2005, combined
       with investments in gas infrastructure, and structural and market reforms – the
       domestic gas market remains underdeveloped.
   •   The wide and growing spread between PGN’s average gas purchasing price
       and its average sale price to customers is reflective of Indonesia’s domestic



                                         57
         gas supply-demand balance situation, and distortions in the domestic energy
         market. In 2012, PGN’s Average Selling Price of $8.54/MMBTU exceeded
         its Average Gas purchase price of $3.93/MMBTU by $4.61/MMBTU. This
         price spread has grown over time and is one of the reasons that PGN has
         quickly grown into a very profitable gas company. 13 Another reason for the
         rapid increase in PGN’s profitability and revenues in the period 2005 to 2013
         is the large increase in the volume of gas sold domestically following the
         development of new gas infrastructure in West Java.
     •   Further of expansion of Indonesia’s gas production capacity, pipeline and
         storage capacity, and LNG regasification capacity would contribute to
         improving gas supply, changing the demand-supply balance, and thereby
         domestic gas prices.
     •   Additional reforms to gas pricing in Indonesia could spur an increase in
         domestic gas supplies and the usage of gas. Further increases in the use of gas
         would help reduce localized pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. There is
         also scope to review the extent to which gas sector unbundling has occurred,
         and how effectively this has contributed to: increased competition,
         transparency, and efficiency gains. Such a review could also assess: (i) how
         gas sector efficiency gains have been shared between gas suppliers, pipeline
         owners, gas consumers, and others; and (ii) the scope for and benefits of
         greater gas pipeline interconnection within Indonesia and with East Asia.

2. Pipeline tariffs

     •   BPH Migas is empowered to set the tariffs for transporting gas through
         pipelines. These tariffs are also referred to as toll fees.

     •   In setting gas pipeline toll fees, BPH Migas is obliged to consider the
         economics of pipeline owner, and the interests of the shippers and consumers
         (Government Regulation No 36, 2004, Article 33).

     •   The regulator uses a cost-of-service rate making methodology to establish the
         toll fees (BPH Migas Rule No. 16/P/BPH Migas/VII/2008). Using this
         methodology BPH Migas seeks to establish toll fees that are fair, transparent,
         accountable and affordable, by taking into account the economics and
         engineering aspects of gas pipelines.

                                        
           =      ℎℎ


     •   Under the cost-of-service ratemaking, the toll fees are designed taking into
         account a pipeline's cost of providing services, including the ability of the
         pipeline owner to earn a reasonable return on its investment (BPH Migas
         Regulation No.8/2013).



13
  In contrast, during 2005 the spread was $2.45/MMBTU; with PGN’s Average Selling Price being
$5.00/MMBTU and its Average Gas purchase price being $2.55/MMBTU.




                                                                     58
          =    + &  +
          +  +  +   

   •   BPH Migas establishes the allowable rate of profit in the above Cost of
       Service calculation after assessing the profitability of the gas pipeline
       enterprise as follows:

        =
        ℎ     ×    .


III. Summary of gas pricing and open access reforms

In summary and conclusion, it appears that project’s technical assistance contributed
to significant reforms in the areas of domestic gas pricing and open access to gas
pipeline networks. The form and content of the new pricing and open access regimes
implemented since 2007 reflect, in large parts, many of the findings and
recommendations made in the project’s technical assistance reports.

At the end of the project:
   1. New streamlined regulatory arrangements for Third Party Access to
      transportation lines were established in 2007 and 2008 and all PGN’s gas
      transmission pipelines now operate under Open Access arrangements.
   2. There is limited implementation of Third Party (Open) Access on PGN's Gas
      Distribution networks -- with this being restricted to national interest and
      government programs.
   3. Efforts to implement revisions to the existing third Party (Open) Access
      arrangements for Gas Distribution Networks have stalled, together with moves
      to unbundle PGN's distribution network assets. That is, the Energy & Mineral
      Resources Ministry Regulation No. 19, 2009 has not been effectively
      implemented because the government is still considering the matter.
   4. There have been some reforms to gas pricing, including: a) implementation of
      new regulations concerning the calculation of gas transportation and
      distribution tolls; b) increased transparency on gas prices; c) PGN shifting to
      regionalized and differentiated pricing on a nationwide basis from April 1,
      2010; b) PGN implementing large increases in its selling prices to customers
      in West Java in 2012 and 2013 following increases to PGN’s buying price of
      gas.
   5. Further reforms to gas pricing are unlikely to be implemented until there is a
      consensus of views on key aspects of the pricing framework and a political
      will to scale back the range and number of special users’ whose gas prices are
      determined by Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources. As of April 1,
      2014, there appears to remain a divergence on views between Bappenas, SKK
      Migas (the successor to BP Migas), and BPH Migas on some aspects of the
      gas pricing regime.




                                                           59
6. The government has not abandoned the use of ministerial allocations that
   specific how gas reserved for domestic supply is to be split across domestic
   gas customers. For example:
       a. On February 7, 2013, the government set the allocation of domestic
          LNG for FSRU terminals across Indonesia. PGN’s FSRU at Lampung
          received an allocation of 10 LNG cargoes per year for 10 years starting
          in 2015.
       b. Subsequently, on May 13, 2013, SKK Migas issued a new allocation of
          644 cargoes of LNG to the domestic market over the period 2013-
          2021. PGN’s FSRU Lampung was allocated 18 LNG cargoes per year
          starting from 2016, with the supply to come from BP Tangguh,
          Chevron IDD and Eni Muara Bakau. The allocation set only the
          amount of the cargoes, with the commercial terms of transactions to be
          negotiated between gas suppliers and customers.
7. A degree of vertical integration has been allowed to take place, with: a) PGN
   investing in gas exploration; and b) PLN and several gas producers in
   Sumatera have successfully gained licenses to develop their own open access
   transmission or distribution pipelines to directly sell gas to large gas customers
   within some of PGN’s existing distribution areas. To date there is little
   interest in significantly expanding the small number (15) of low pressure
   distribution networks (Gas Kota or City Gas networks) that service household
   customers.
IV. Follow on reforms to Indonesia’s domestic gas market
There is considerable scope for further World Bank technical assistance in
Indonesia’s domestic gas market, particularly in the critically strategic areas of: (i)
gas pricing; (ii) further industry restructuring; (iii) gas infrastructure financing in
greenfield areas; and (iv) further transitioning more towards market based means
of balancing the energy security need for adequate petroleum fuel supplies for
domestic use versus the opportunity cost of foregoing long term revenues arising
from exporting LNG at high global prices.
Indeed, the Bank is already seeking to re-engage with Government of Indonesia
on matters of gas sector policy, as part of the Bank’s broader strategic
engagement.
Specifically, in 2012-2013 the Bank provided technical assistance under the Gas
Development Master Plan. That TA was undertaken in partnership with the
Government of Indonesia (DG Oil & Gas, and BAPPENAS) with funding from
Australia’s bilateral program (formerly referred to as AusAID INDII). The
activity was designed by the Bank through discussions with key stakeholders in
Indonesia's gas sector including the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources,
BAPPENAS, the upstream, and downstream gas sector regulators, the private
sector and others.
In December 2013 that TA work produced 10 policy notes, a gas planning and
optimization model, and a benchmarking and final report in order to assist the
Government with increasing domestic gas supply, relieving transportation
bottlenecks, improving the pricing regime, relieving the demand supply
imbalance, identifying policy gaps, and making recommendations for each of the
TA areas.


                                        60
During the first half of 2014, the Government was seeking to formalize the
recommendations through the issuance of two ministerial and one Presidential
decree in the following three areas:
1. Gas demand and supply balance;
2. Gas infrastructure financing and tendering; and
3. Gas pricing.


During March 2014, the Government was forming three task forces at SKK
MIGAS (upstream regulator); DG MIGAS (Directorate General, Oil & Gas); and
Bappenas (State Planning Ministry) for getting the decrees issued by end April
2014.
Bappenas, which is chairing the Steering Committee, has requested a more
detailed study and analytical underpinning to support the gas pricing decree. The
Bank, in conjunction with Australia, has sought to meet that request.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Project Economic Analysis

Methodology at Appraisal

Economic Costs

The ex-ante economic costs of the project included: (a) total investment costs for gas
transmission pipelines (partly financed by the JBIC) and for gas distribution network
(partly financed by the Bank); (b) O&M costs related to the transmission and
distribution facilities; (c) expenditures for gas purchases; (d) cost associated with gas
losses incurred during transmission and distribution, and (e) conversion investment
costs to be undertaken by customers for fuel switching. All the costs excluded taxes
and duties and financing costs. The conversion factor was considered as 1.0 when
estimating the economic costs from financial costs because the distortions in the
exchange and wage rates in the overall costs were not considered significant enough
to justify the use of shadow prices.

Detailed assumptions considered in the ex-ante cost analyses were as follows:

•   The investment costs for the transmission and distribution components of the
    project was estimated at US$408.79 million and US$109.52 million;

•   The annual incremental O&M costs were assumed to be 2 percent of the
    investment costs for transmission and distribution components of the project.

•   Gas losses were assumed to be 2 percent of the annual quantity of gas received
    from producers.

•   Under the gas purchase agreement between Pertamina and PGN, Pertamina would
    sell the gas to PGN at the inlet of the transmission line for US$2.00 per mmBtu
    for the first year, and the price would be indexed at 2.2 percent for the ensuing
    years. Although this reflected a financial cost, it was assumed to be the average
    incremental economic cost (AIC) of the exploration, development and production,
    given the proximity of this value to the AIC calculated for Indonesia as part of the
    Bank’s sector analytical work in 2000 (that is, US$1.90–2.25 per mmBtu). This
    gas purchase price was used to estimate the gas purchase costs for the project.

Economic Benefits

The ex-ante economic benefits of the project (cash flow from sales of gas by PGN)
were estimated based on the assumption that the economic value of gas was equal to
the future market prices of oil products to be replaced by gas. Oil product prices were
based on the Bank’s projection of oil price during appraisal at US$26 per bbl. Other
benefits of the project, such as energy efficiency and product quality improvement
due to switching from oil products to gas, as well as environmental benefits of
substituting cleaner gas for oil products, were not considered in the estimate.

Detailed assumptions ex-ante benefit analysis were as follows:


                                           62
   •    The volume of gas sales: Although the carrying capacity of the transmission is
        450 mmcfd and the capacity of the distribution system was 550 mmcfd, the
        evaluation of the project benefits was based on the gas purchase agreement
        signed between PGN and Pertamina. According to the agreement, Pertamina
        would supply gas to PGN from June 2006 according to the following
        schedule: 150 mmBtu for the first year, 200 mmBtu for the second year and
        250 mmBtu from the third year up to 2018. It was assumed that after 2018,
        the gas supply would remain at 250 mmcfd level and the price would be the
        same as that in 2018. At the time of appraisal, PGN had already secured other
        sources to supply the West Java market, of which about 160 mmcfd could be
        distributed by the system expanded under the project.

   •    According to PGN’s gas market survey prior to appraisal, the fossil fuels to be
        replaced by gas from the proposed project would be fuel oil (18 percent),
        automotive and industrial diesels (72 percent and 10 percent, respectively).

   •    The prices of fuel oil and diesel are estimated at US$3.74 per mmBtu (fuel oil),
        US$6.23 per mmBtu (automotive diesel) and US$6.03 per mmBtu (industrial
        diesel) based on the Bank’s recent long-term forecast of crude oil prices
        available at appraisal: US$26 per bbl.

   •    Customer conversion costs were estimated by PGN at about US$10.3 million.

Methodology at project completion

The ex-post economic cost benefit analysis used an identical methodology to that used
at appraisal, except that:
    •   Actual costs at the end of the project are used. The transmission
        investment costs were US$433.76 million and the distribution investment
        costs US$81.76 million (see Tables A3.1 an A3.2). Customer conversion
        costs were $10.3 million.
    •   The volume of gas sales:
            o Actual data on the level of increased gas sales in the West Java area
              (SBU1) through the South Sumatera West Java 1 (SSWJ1)
              transmission pipeline has been used, covering the period 2005 to 2013.
            o For the period 2009 to 2022, it is assumed that the full 400 mmscfd
              capacity of the SSWJ1 pipeline is utilized to supply West Java, based
              on the fact that PGN’s contracted volumes into West Java exceed 400
              mmscfd and that some of them must be flowing down the SSWJ2
              pipeline. SSWJ1 was built first and only its capital costs and capacity
              are taken into account in the ex-post cost benefit analysis; consistent
              with the ex-ante cost-benefit analysis. Only later was the SSWJ2
              pipeline built, adding another 400 mmscfd of potential capacity and
              bring the combined gas pipeline transfer capacity between South
              Sumatera and West Java up to 800 mmscfd. Consequently, SSWJ2 is
              excluded from this ex-post cost-benefit analysis.



                                          63
       o For the period 2023 to 2025, gas volumes fall to 394 mmscfd, in line
         with PGN’s contracted gas for 2022.




•   Gas prices.
       o The ex-post analysis uses historic data on PGN’s Average Purchase
         Price of Gas and its Average Selling Price of Gas in the period 2004 to
         2013.

           o Customers’ Willingness to Pay (WTP) for gas is assumed to be equal
             to the PGN’s Average Selling Price of Gas. This WTP assumption
             affects the calculation of project benefits.
           o For the period 2014 to 2025, it is assumed that PGN’s Average
             Purchase Price of Gas remains at its 2013 level ($4.49/MMBTU) as
             does its Average Selling Price of Gas ($9.20/MMBTU).

Results of ex-post economic cost-benefit analysis
   • The ex-post economic cost-benefit analysis indicates that the project has a
     very high net benefit, valued at $2.7 billion in NPV terms with 10%
     discount factor. The Economic Rate of Internal Return (EIRR) is also high
     at 64.5%.
   • The drivers of these very strong results appear to be: (i) the substantial
     spread between the Average Purchase Price of Gas and the Average Selling
     Price of Gas; and (ii) the increased volumes of gas sold.
   • These very positive results vindicate the decision to proceed with the
     project and point to the large potential for further economic benefits to
     arise from future infrastructure investments in Indonesia’s downstream gas
     sector.

Executive Summary

The utilization of natural gas in Indonesia is still constrained by some inter-related
issues among others the underdeveloped of the natural gas transmission and
distribution infrastructure. This Indonesia Domestic Gas Market Development Project
which intended to expand the use of natural gas in the West Java market under Loan
No. 4810-IND addressed such matter. The intermediate result of this project also
addressed other aspects such as PGN Restructuring, third party access and gas pricing
which expected to support the expansion of West Java Gas Distribution network.

The Loan Agreement and Project Agreement have set the indicators of the Project
Development Objectives to be fulfilled and milestones to be achieved. The
achievement of such indicators and milestones was sourced from project reports and
documentation and consultation with relevant PGN internal sources of information
such as PGN’s Strategic Business Unit, Corporate Finance, HSE, HRD, and
Organization and Business Process Division.

Overall, the project outcome as stated in the Project Agreement has been achieved as
indicated based on actual data in 2010 by the increasing of PGN’s gas sales in West
Java (573 mmscfd), increasing of the number of customers converted to gas (444
customers) and the significant reduction of major air pollutants and greenhouse gas in
the form of: (i) SO2 (135,000 tons per year), (ii) NOx (163,000 tons per year), (iii)
TSP (76,000 tons per year), (iv) CO2e (3,964,000 tons per year). All such
achievement were “highly satisfactory” and exceeds the target stated in the Project
Agreement. However the timeframe to complete the major milestone was extended
compared to the original plan due to adjustment to the actual conditions encountered
during the implementation period.

As for the achievement of other aspects such as PGN Restructuring, third party access
and gas pricing were “moderately satisfactory”. As an achievement, PGN has
strengthened its capability in planning and operating the distribution system,
improved its organization structure, implemented some degree of third party access
for the key transmission activities and limited third party to support national interest
and government program for some distribution activities. With regard to the gas
pricing, PGN has completed the study on Gas Pricing Framework and Methodology
& Implementation Rules for Transmission and Distribution Tariffs and has submitted
such report study to World Bank and BPH Migas for consideration. Currently the
government plans to revise the open access and unbundling regulation stipulated in
the Energy Ministry Regulation No. 19 Year 2009 in order to make the
implementation of such scheme to become more effective. PGN is still looking
forward for such revised regulation.

During the implementation of the project, there are some obstacles which related to
the commercial and technical aspects of the project. Recommendation in this report
addressed such aspects for further improvement in the project implementation.

Lessons Learned
The following are the lessons learned from the implementation of the contract
packages under the project:

    a. For EPC Pipeline Installation, Offtake Stations and SCADA &
       Telecommunication and PCC Branchline Installation, Customers
       Attachment & MRS Installation Contract Packages:
       • Detail Investigation about the road regulation (for example: regarding road
          backfilling material) is required to be performed prior to the bidding
          process and should be incorporated in bid document.
       • Approval of crossing method (include the requirement of pipe casing)
          from relevant authority is required to be obtained and defined prior to the
          bidding process and should be incorporated in bid document.
       • All information regarding interface works including location of connection
          point (location of Offtake Station), location of the customers & premises
          (for SCADA installation) and Supporting Facilities of existing customers
          (electricity, SCADA houses, AC, etc.) should be defined prior to the
          bidding process and incorporated in bid document.
       • Status of permit and principal permit of the pipeline route which shall be
          obtained by the Employer should be cleared prior to the bidding process
          and defined in the bid document.
       • Detail soil investigation along the route (include under road crossing)
          should be performed in order to minimize the claim due to unforeseen
          condition.
       • Conceptual Design and overall plan should be fixed prior to bidding
          process.
       • Land Acquisition of the Offtake Station should be fixed and cleared prior
          to Bidding process.
       • Target schedule of gas-in for each customer should be defined clearly in
          bid document.
       • There was one contract package which was cancelled due to the nominated
          bidder requested an escalation of bid price due to the long period between
          the bid submission and bid award.

    b. For Line Pipe Procurement and MRS Procurement Contract Packages:
       • Quantity of procured pipe and MRSshould be calculated in detail for each
          diameter/size based on the actual requirement.

Conclusion
Development of gas infrastructure while supported by effective gas pricing policy will
potentially give significant impact to overcome many problems such as the low rate of
investment and to improve the weak public service. It also strengthened PGN’s gas
distribution infrastructure and increase company revenue which further will be
utilized for infrastructure development in accordance with government programs to
reduce oil fuel subsidy. Gas infrastructure development also has a significant rule in
reducing environment problem, especially air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

This project raised the opportunity for many industries, especially in West Java, to
easily utilize gas for their operation which eventually increasing the economic
efficiency by using cheaper, cleaner fuel and reducing its production cost. This project
also gave PGN an institutional strenghtening by restructured and improve PGN’s
financial management, operation, planning, and safety management system that help
PGN to serve better.


(b) Borrower Comments on Bank ICR

Two documents are required for the completion process of Domestic Gas Market
Development Project: Implementation Completion and Result Report (ICR) at the
World Bank side and Borrower Completion Report at the PGN side. The Borrower
Completion Report which contains records of project achievements, as well as project
evaluation for future improvement, has been submitted to the World Bank. The
sections below are the review and comment on the draft of ICR prepared by the
World Bank for project ratings:

We agree with the “Satisfactory” rating for the outcomes and Bank/Borrower
performance. The ratings are supported with the record of fulfilled PDO indicators
and Intermediate Outcome Indicators. The project was completed on time, within
budget, and with successful implementation. However, the detail explanation in the
section 5 (Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance) provides different
performance rating compared to the rating in the Table of Ratings Summary (page iv).
Some ratings provided in the Section 5 are “Moderately Satisfactory”.
