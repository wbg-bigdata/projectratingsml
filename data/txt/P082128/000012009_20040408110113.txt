Executive Summary
The Government of Albania has requested support from the World Bank towards
the implementation of a Water Resources Management Project. This project will
help Albania to increase the contribution of water resources to sustainable
economic growth through increase in agriculture production. The implemented
agency for the proposed project is the Project Management Unit (PMU) under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MoAF).
It is expected that the proposed Project will include the following components:
*  Component 1: System Rehabilitation
*  Component 2: Institutional development for irrigation, drainage and flood
management sector
*   Component 3: Institutional support for water resources management, and
*  Component 4: Project implementation support
Under Component 1, the Project will support repair and rehabilitation of selected
irrigation and drainage infrastructure (e.g., irrigation canals, drainage structures,
pumping stations) to improve agriculture productivity as well as urgent physical
measures to improve the safety of dams. The Project will not support investments
into new infrastructure and all works will be done in agricultural lands. Given the
nature of the physical works to be supported under the project, the project has
been classified as Environmental Category B.
As part of project preparatory activities, the PMU under the MOAF has prepared
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the first six irrigation rehabilitation
schemes intended to be financed under Component lof the Project. Under the
initial phase. The schemes selected for rehabilitation during the first phase include
Berat (BRU-3), Fier (FRU-3), Korce Gjanci (KOU-1), Lezhe (LEU-1), Shkoder
(SHU-4/9) and Vlore (VLU-1).
Since the remaining of the investments are not know yet, given the demand-driven
nature of the project -water users associations and drainage boards will apply to
the Project for assistance, the PMU has also prepared Environmental Management
Plan Framework (EMPF). The EMPF will serve as a valuable tool for identifying
key environmental and social impacts that could result from the rehabilitation



works to be supported under the Project. It proposes environmental screening,
mitigation measures to address the most significant negative impacts, monitoring
programs, public disclosure and institutional responsibilities for implementation.
This document summaries the results of the EIA and EMPF, which were carried
out with the assistance of Halcrow Group Limited.
Environmental Impact Assessment of Sub-Projects in First Phase
The World Bank has been supporting the Government of Albania through the
MoAF with the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes since the end of 1994. The
First Irrigation Rehabilitation Project led to the rehabilitation of about 91,000 ha of
irrigation lands and 120,000 ha of drainage systems between 1995 and 2000. The
Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project (SIDRP) rehabilitated the
primary works of irrigation systems covering 50,000 ha, secondary works to 25,000
ha and drainage systems for 90,000 ha. The SIDRP had a bottom-up demand-
driven approach in which the rehabilitation of irrigation canals depended on the
strong commitment of farmers, including up-front financial contributions. Initially,
farmers were reluctant to invest in these projects, but participation increased
dramatically as the benefits became apparent.
During the initial phase, the Project will focus in completing rehabilitation works
that started under the SIDRP, for which an environmental screening reports and
feasibility studies were prepared. The Screening Reports and Feasibility Studies
have been updated to allow for the work completed in the SIDRP on these
schemes and the work that is anticipated to be carried out under the proposed
Project.
The irrigation schemes covered in the EIA section of this report are: Berat BRU-3,
Fier FRU-3, Korce Gjanci KOU-1, Lezhe LEU-1, Shkoder SHU-4/9 and Vlore
VLU-1.
Each scheme was evaluated according to the World Bank guidelines for impacts
upon the physical, biological and socio-economic environments. Impacts were
graded as positive or negative and according to degree of severity from no impact
through minor, moderate and severe levels. All schemes have been determined to
be environmentally acceptable with negative impacts (i.e. those imposing some
degree of risk to the environment) either nil or minor. Mitigation measures have
been introduced to offset the minor negative aspects to the extent possible. These
measures consist of engineering interventions, incorporated into the design of the



schemes, or modifications to farming practices (through training schemes) to
reduce groundwater and drain pollution by agrochemicals.
Improved irrigation and drainage will have beneficial impacts worth highlighting.
First, they will reduce waterlogging and increase crop production, maintaining
sustainability by ensuring salinity control. Second, they will derive considerable
improvement of farm incomes and living standards of families dependant on
agriculture, by increased employment opportunities, enhanced land values,
improvement in the nutrition of both humans and animals, an overall
improvement in health and an increase in the quality of life.
The potential negative environmental impacts of the proposed rehabilitation works
have been grouped into two sets: those that may occur during the construction
phase, and those that may occur during the operation phase.
During constructions, impacts will be limited to disturbance, noise and dust as well
as disposal problems. These impacts will be temporary and will cease on the
completion of the works. During the operation phase, potential environmental
impacts may arise from sediment accumulation in canals, deterioration of water
quality downstream and groundwater sources, disturbance to localized ecosystems,
and hydrological disturbance.
Water quality deterioration could lead to public health concerns associated with
nitrate levels in potable water from wells and the presence of untreated sewage in
drain water, which is at present recycled within irrigation scheme for irrigation of
summer vegetables. The nitrate problem wil be tackled under the farmer training
programme. The irrigation of crops with potentialy polluted water will be
substantial reduced by making available additional irrigation water supply. The
review of the monitoring data collected over the first twelve month period of
operation of the rehabilitated schemes shows that at present the quality of drainage
water and groundwater is within acceptable limnits. Monitoring will continue during
the life of the proposed Project.
Potential disturbance to ecosystem has been identified in two schemes: Skoder
SLU-4 and Vlore VLU-1. These two sub-projects discharge into rivers that
eventually reach Category 4 nature reserves. The Shkoder SLU -4 whose water,
after dilution in Lake Myrtemza, reaches the Viluni lagoon and Vlore VLU-1,
which discharges some drain water to the Narta lagoon. Current baseline data
reveal that at present the quantities of pollutants passing into these schemes is
relatively small. Nonetheless, it is important to monitoring drainage discharge
given the dynamics of the irrigation sector and the increased agriculture production



the rehabilitation works are expected to bring may lead to the increases in agro-
chemical application.
Hydrological disturbance are not expected in any of the six schemes, since in all
cases, the quantity of water to be abstracted will not exceed the amount extracted
in former times. Trends in water use will be monitor during project
implementation.
Public meetings were held for all sub-projects where each proposed scheme was
outlined and the environmental implications of the development were explained.
In all cases there was overwhelming support for rehabilitation.
In 2001, four of the sub-projects were submitted to the Albanian Ministry of
Environment and Food (former Natiaonal Agency for Environmental Protection)
and received approval, subject to monitoring conditions in respect of Shkoder and
Vlore that have been incorporated into the environmental management plan for
those sub-projects. Procedures are being followed to obtain the approval of the
Ministry of Environment for the Berat and Korce Gjanci schemes.
Tables A through F below present the Environmental Management Plans (EMPs)
for each scheme proposed for first phase. The EMP proposes mitigation and
monitoring measures to address potential negative impacts identified during the
environmental screening, the implementation arrangements, the timing of the
implementation of the measure, the proposed training, and the respective
incremental cost of the measure.
Environmental Management Plan Framework (EMPF)
The PMU has also prepared the EMPF, which describes procedures for
environmental screening, environmental documentation, review and approval,
consultation, disclosure as well as institutional arrangements for ensuring full
consideration of environmental safeguards accordance to World Bank operational
guidelines and Albania procedures in the implementation of additional
investments for rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes financed under
the project and proposed by Water Users Associations and Drainage Board.
While EMPF provides procedures for environmental screening and categorization,
the EMPF describes procedures to deal with only environmental categories B and
C schemes. Procedures for any environmental category A scheme would be
developed on a case by case and in consultation with the World Bank. The EMPF
will become an integral part of the Project Operational Manual.

Introduction
The Government of Albania has requested support from the World Bank towards
the implementation of a Water Resources Management Project. This project will
help Albania to increase the contribution of water resources to sustainable
economic growth through increase in agriculture production. The implemented
agency for the proposed project is the Project Management Unit (PMU) under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MOAF)
It is expected that the proposed Project will include the following components:
*  Component 1: System Rehabilitation
*   Component 2: Institutional development for irrigation, drainage and flood
management sector
* Component 3: Institutional support for water resources management, and
*  Component 4: Project implementation support
The Government of Albania has requested support from the World Bank towards
the implementation of a Water Resources Management Project. This project will
help Albania to increase the contribution of water resources to sustainable
economic growth through increase in agriculture production. The implemented
agency for the proposed project is the Project Management Unit (PMU) under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MoAF).
It is expected that the proposed Project will include the following components:
*  Component 1: System Rehabilitation
* Component 2: Institutional development for irrigation, drainage and flood
management sector
*  Component 3: Institutional support for water resources management, and
*  Component 4: Project implementation support
Under Component 1, the Project will support repair and rehabilitation of selected
irrigation and drainage infrastructure (e.g., irrigation canals, drainage structures,
pumping stations) to improve agriculture productivity as well as urgent physical
measures to improve the safety of dams. The Project will not support investments
into new infrastructure and all works will be done in agricultural lands. Given the



nature of the physical works to be supported under the project, the project has
been classified as Environmental Category B.
As part of project preparatory activities, the PMU under the MOAF with the
assistance of Halcrow Group Limited has prepared an Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) of the first six irrigation rehabilitation schemes intended to be
financed under Component lof the Project. Under the initial phase. The schemes
selected for rehabilitation during the first phase include Berat (BRU-3), Fier (FRU-
3), Korce Gjanci (KOU-1), Lezhe (LEU-1), Shkoder (SHU-4/9) and Vlore (VLU-
1).
Since the remaining of the investments are not know yet, given the demand-driven
nature of the project -water users associations and drainage boards will apply to
the Project for assistance, the PMU has also prepared Environmental Management
Plan Framework (ENIPF). The EMPF provides procedures for environmental
screening and environmental categorization as well as public disclosure procedures
and institutional responsibilities for implementation.

2                   Background
Agriculture is the leading sector of the Albanian economy accounting for
approximately 50% of the GDP and 60% of the total employment. Although
Albania has substantial annual rainfall, the distribution varies from 3,000mm in the
northern mountains to only 800mm in the coastal area with less than 20% of the
rainfall occurring in the six-month period from April to September. Summer
crops can only be grown if irrigation water is available and drainage is important in
preventing flooding and water logging in winter, particularly in the coastal plain.
The construction of irrigation and drainage schemes was given high priority under
the socialist regime and by mid-1980s irrigation and drainage schemes covering
about 420,000 and 280,000 hectares respectively were constructed.
During the socialist era, the state-owned Water Enterprises (WE) were responsible
for the entire irrigation and drainage sector. During the gradual decline of the
economy in the last period of the socialist regime, many irrigation and drainage
systems entered into a vicious cycle of inadequate budget allocation, deferred
maintenance, system deterioration and unreliable water delivery, which was
exacerbated by the massive destruction of public property following the collapse of
the socialist regime in 1991. As a result many irrigation and drainage schemes
ceased operations and by 1993 only 80,000 hectares were irrigated.
Since the end of 1994, the World Bank has been supporting the Government of
Albania through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (NIoAF) with the
rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes in order to improve their performance
so that small farmers would be able to increase their agricultural production and
improve their livelihoods.
In response to the acute crisis in the irrigation and drainage sector, the
Government of Albania adopted the policy to transfer the operational
responsibilities of secondary irrigation canals to water users through Water Users'
Associations (WUAs), with the operation and maintenance of the primary canals
and irrigation reservoirs remaining the responsibility of the state-owned Water
Enterpn'ses. However, the Water Enterprises were not able to manage the primary
canals and reservoirs due to diminishing subsidies and the extensive vandalism
perpetrated during the civil turmoil of 1997. In 1998 the Government decided that
the responsibility for operation and maintenance of the primary irrigation facilities
7



and associated drainage schemes should also be transferred to water users through
Federations of Water Users' Associations (FWUAs).
Under the First Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, irrigation systems covering about
91,000 hectares and drainage systems for some 120,000 hectares were rehabilitated
between 1995 and 2000. As there was a clear need to expand the initiatives taken
under the first project across the country and to ensure the sustainability of the
irrigation and drainage sector by continuing and completing the essential
institutional reform a second project was undertaken. The Second Irrigation and
Drainage Rehabilitation Project (SIDRP) rehabilitated the primary works of
irrigation systems covering 50,000 hectares and secondary works to 25,000
hectares and drainage systems for 90,000 hectares.
The primary objectives of the SIDRP were:
*      to achieve sustainable and equitable use of irrigation water for agricultural
production;
*      to reduce the risks of floods; and
*      to support Government's initiative towards establishing institutional and
legal framework for dam safety.
The SIDRP had a bottom-up demand-driven approach in which the rehabilitation
of irrigation canals depended on the strong commitment of farmers, including up-
front financial contributions, in order to nurture their ownership. Initially farmers
paid only sufficient to rehabilitate the primary works but as the benefits became
apparent demand for rehabilitation of the secondary systems has increased
dramatically with farmers depositing their financial contribution.
The proposed Water Resource Management Project (WRMP) will complete the
rehabilitation works and the irrigation management transfer process.

3                   Legal, Policy and Institutional
Framework
3.1                 Legal and Policy Framework
3.1.1              Irrigation, Drainage and Water Resources Management
Irrigation and drainage activities are governed by two laws, the Law on Water
Resources (LWR) No. 8093 of 1996, and the Law on Irrigation and Drainage
(LID), No. 8515 of 1999.
The LWR establishes the National Water Council (NWC).
The purpose of the LID is:
*      to establish a comprehensive legal framework for the establishment and
operation of Water Users Associations (WUAs), Federation of Water
Users Associations (FWUAs) and Drainage Board Councils (DBCs).
*      to define institutional arrangements and competences supporting a
national policy in respect of irrigation, drainage and flood protection in
Albania
*      to determine the legal rights and duties of legal and natural persons
involved in irrigation, drainage and flood protection
*      to provide for the transfer in use and in ownership of irrigation systems to
WUAs and FWUAs, and
*      to provide for the transfer in use and in ownership of drainage systems
and flood defence works to DBCs.
3.1.2               Environment
Environmental legislation is governed by the Law on Environmental Protection
No. 8934, dated September 5, 2002. This Law establishes national and local
policies on environmental protection, requirements for the preparation of
environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments,
requirements for permitting the activities that affect the environment, prevention
and reduction of environmental pollution, environmental norms and standards,
environmental monitoring and control, duties of the state bodies in relation to
environmental issues, role of the public and sanctions imposed for law violations.
9



According to the Law on Environment, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) is
the competent authority for reviewing the request for ELA documentation
prepared by independent experts hired by the project developer. The Law provides
that the MOE will prepare and approve a list of experts to provide such services.
The list has not been approved yet.
A new law on EIA , No.8990 was approved on January 23, 2003. This law defines
the rules, procedures and deadlines in identifying and assessing the direct or
indirect activities of projects or activities on the environment. The law establishes
provisions for all of the steps necessary to implement the EIA procedures:
presentation of the application, preliminary review, selection and classification
criteria, public hearing and consultation, access to information, duties and rights of
other bodies. The law also provides the list of activities that should be subject to
the extended EIA process. These activities include oil and gas refinery plants,
thermo-power stations, smelters, oil and other mineral extraction, incinerators, etc.,
with an identified capacity. The other list of activities that includes: agriculture,
silviculture, aquaculture, quarries, food industries and other activities not included
in the other list, is subject to the shortened EIA process. The extended EIA report
should contain besides the standard data on the project, its description, potential
impacts on the environment and rehabilitation measure, more detailed information
on the site selection, direct and indirect impacts, potential impact on of the several
development options on environment and public health, estimation of the risks for
the accidents with considerable impact on the environment and sustainable use of
energy, natural and mineral resources. Requirements for the implementation of
transboundary EIA are also included, since Albania has ratified Espoo Convention
on Transboundary Impacts.
3.1.3               International Conventions
Albania has signed and ratified a number of intemational conventions.
(a)    The UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary
Watercourses and International Lakes. This was ratified on January 5,
1994. The Protocol on Water and Health was ratified on March 8, 2002.
(b)    The Convention on the Environmental Impact Assessment in
Transboundary Context was ratified by Albania on October 4, 1991.
(c)    The UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial
Accidents was ratified onJanuary 5, 1994.
(d)    Albania is a signatory to the RAMSAR Convention (1971) on the
protection of wedands. At present there two designated RAMSAR sites in
10



Albania: the Karavasta lagoon and Butrinti Lake. The Narta lagoon has
been identified as a candidate RAMSAR site. A management programme
for the lagoon was proposed under the PHARE programme (PHARE,
December 1999) and is being followed by UNDP/GEF . The wider
objective of the management programme would be to promote the
sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of bio-diversity by
the improvement, planning and managing the resources of the lagoon.
(e)    The Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in
decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters was
signed by the Ministers of Environment of EU Member States in Aarhus,
Denmark, on 25 June 1998. Albania ratified the Aarhus Convention on 27
June 2001.
3.2                InstitutionalFramework
3.2.1              Irrigation, Drainage and Water Resources Management
The principal executing agency established under the Law on Water Resources
(LWR) is the Technical Secretariat of the National Water Council (NWC), which is
responsible for montoring the nation's water resources, proposing regulations for
their sustainable development and issuing permissions and licences for water
abstractions, discharges and transfer of water across river basin boundaries. The
law also provides for a regional component of water resources management based
on Drainage Basin Councils (DBCs), responsible for the implementation of
national water resources policy and permitting. However, the NWC has not been
allocated sufficient budget to establish any DBCs.
In principal, the WUAs and FWUAs are responsible for entering into contracts
with upstream suppliers of water, or securing licences to divert water, and then
supplying the water to their members for an agreed fee.
The DBCs are responsible for the operation and maintenance of drainage and
flood defence systems under the supervision of local interest groups such as
FWUAs, municipalities and communes.
The regulation of groundwater abstraction for potable water supply is currently
divided between the National Water Supply and Sanitation Regulatory Commission
(NWSSRC) and the National Geological Service (NGS).
In summary, the legislation results in overlapping competences in the management
of water resources between the various institutions. Three principal organisations



are involved, the NWSSRC, the MOEP, and the NWC/DBCs. However, as the
legislation is not fully implemented, the overlapping competencie s have yet to
materialise. In practise:
*      the role of the NWSSC is limited to approving water charges set by the
newly established Water Supply Companies;
*      the NEA and REAs were established, but they have since been
incorporated into a Ministry of Environment, and remain under-resourced
and unable to carry out their full range of duties;
*      the Technical Secretariat of the NWC has been established but is under-
resourced and none of the DBCs have been established to date.
As a result the management of water resources continues on an ad hoc basis. The
control of surface waters is vested in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MoAF)
through its (Irrigation and Drainage) Water Enterprises (WE) and the control of
groundwater is with the Ministry of Public Works through the Water (Supply)
Enterprises/ Companies. In many districts of Albania, responsibility for irrigation
supply infrastructure has been handed over to the FWUAs and WUAs. The WUAs
have also acccepted respo nsibility for the tertiary drainage systems in their areas
whilst the remainder of the drainage system currently rests with the WEs.
3.2.2               Entironment
In 2002, the Ministry of Environment approved its new structure, which consists
of. The Directorate of Policy, Legislation and Integration, Directorate of EIA,
Directorate of Pollution Prevention, Directorate of Nature Conservation and
Directorate of Foreign relations and Communication. The new structure indudes
the Environmental Inspectorate which on central level is comprised of the Chief
inspector and two other inspectors, while in the qark (regional) level of the
inspectors of the Regional Environmental Agencies. The EIA directorate and the
Environmental Inspectorate coordinate their activities as regards inspection of
environmental damages and pollution and enforcement of the permit
conditionalities. The REAs are responsible for the enforcement of environmental
legislation at the local level through local inspection. The inspection includes the
review of actual construction in order to determine compliance and monitoring.
The REAs must provide approval before construction can commence. They have
the authority to take action should there be a breach of regulations or permit
requirements, including halting works.
12



The EIA system of proposed and on-going projects is administrated by the EIA
Directorate of the MOE. The EIA Directorate has approximately 5 level staff in
Tirana and about 30 local staff in 12 Qarks. The EIA Directorate has the expertise
needed to administrate the EIA system, but the expertise shall be further
strengthened. This directorate cooperates very closely with the other technical
directorates of the Ministry especially as regards the screening of the requests,
identifying of the permit conditions monitoring of the permit application and
rehabilitation of the environmental after the conclusion of activities.
A small number of full EIA studies have been carried out for internationally
funded projects, generally under the procedures of the funding institutions.
Although scientific and technical institutions have been weakened during the past
decade, considerable experience exists in the university, scientific institutions and
NGOs on fundamental aspects of environmental impacts assessment.

4                   Overview of Environmental Situation
4.1                Basic Features
The Republic of Albania is situated between latitudes 3938' and 42o39' north and
longitudes 1916' and 2140' east. It is bordered on the north by Montenegro, to
the north-east by Serbia (Kosovo), to the south-east by the Republic of Macedonia,
to the south by the Republic of Greece, and to the west by the Ionian and Adriatic
Seas. The total surface area is 28,748 square kilometres and the country is divided,
for administrative purposes, into twelve Prefectures and further subdivided into 36
administrative districts.
Albania is a mountainous country, with a varied landscape and much bare rock.
The location between the sea and a mountainous hinterland results in very varied
climatic conditions. The population of 3.4 million is now distributed fairly evenly
between the rural areas (53 5%/6) and the urban areas.
The land use in Albania consists of agricultural land (240/0), forests (360/6), meadow
and pasture (16%) and 'unproductive' land: urban, waterways etc (24%). The total
agricultural area of around 700,000 ha is most intensively cropped in the western
coastal lowlands where the majority of the irrigation schemes are located. About
420,000 ha are supplied with an irrigation infrastructure.
4.2                 Topography and Geology
Albania is a mountainous country and the topography exhibits considerable
variability, with more than 75% of the land being described as hilly or
mountainous. Elevations range from sea level to a maximum of 2751 metres at
Korabi peak. The broad topographic classification adopted (Zdruli, 1997) is
divided into three regions based on height above sea level. These are: the lower
region 0-1000 metres, occupying about 67% of the land mass; the central region
comprised of elevations between 1000-2000 metres and occupying 31% of the
land; and high elevations (2000-2800 metres), that represent 2 % of the total land
area.
Geologically the country is relatively young and was formed during the Tertiary era
when tectonic activity resulted in uplift and formation of the mountain ranges,
oriented in a general south-east to north-west direction. The resulting folding
14



produced anticlines and syndines superimposed on the system of inter-montane
valleys and the coastal lowlands.
The country is located in a tectonically active zone and significant faulting has
resulted in the formation of many steep slopes and near vertical fault scarps.
Igneous rocks form around 15 % of the land area. Most are intrusives and occur in
the north, north-east, central and the south eastern sectors. The central and eastern
regions are dominated by ultrabasic rocks that are the source of the important
deposits of nickel and chromium. These ultrabasic rocks have a complex
mineralogy dominated by the presence of olivine (a magnesium rich silicate). Other
igneous rocks include gabbro, diabase, dolerite and basalt. Acid igneous rocks
include pegmatites and granite. Metamorphic rocks occur only to a limited extent,
usually as marble and gurbrinite.
The sedimentary rocks are widespread and occupy around 85% of the land area,
mainly present on the coastal plain, central and southem Albania. The coastal
plains are mainly sandstones and mudstones (shales) with conglomerates in the
hills. However, limestones occur most frequently throughout the country with
dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) the most common form. Some gypsum
deposits are encountered.
Albania is relatively well endowed with minerals and some thirty types have been
recognised (Mining Journal, 1992). The south-west is rich in hydrocarbons,
particularly petroleum and bitumen, whilst the north-east has chromite, copper and
ferrous nickel deposits.
Petroleum and bitumen are found in the Tertiary deposits along the edge of the
coastal plain between Elbasan and Vlore. Seepages of natural gas have been known
from Classical times and mentioned in the writings of Strabo and Dioscorides. The
petroleum is costly and difficult to refine with a high sulphur and asphalt base. The
bitumen is of high quality and has been exported since Classical times from the
mine at Selenica.
The chromite ore is widely distributed (48% Cr203) and the Albanian deposits are
the fourth largest in the world, although the association with serpentine results in
limited workability.
15



The copper occuts as low grade suiphide ores associated with iron pyrites, largely
found in the valleys of the Mat and Drin rivers.
The iron nickel deposits contain about 1% nickel and were originally processed at
the large metal refining complex at Elbasan.
Lignite is mined at various places within seams that vary from 0.5 to 1.7 metres
thick and of varying calorific value.
4.3                 Climate
Albania is situated between two major atmospheric regions and between two
distinct systems of atmospheric circulation. In winter the Azores High extends
over southern Europe and into Central Asia with low pressure over the
Mediterranean and North Africa, bringing cold dry northerly winds into Albania.
In the summer, Mediterranean low pressure extends northwards and brings very
warm air into the region. At all seasons Atlantic and Mediterranean cyclonic
depressions bring rain that is particularly extensive and violent in the winter
months. Also the virtually land locked Adriatic trough possesses its own low
pressure area and frequent cyclonic depressions bring south west and westerly
winds into Albania. The depressions are forced to rise over the high land with
resultant rainfall. These depressions also accelerate the general circulation of the
Mediterranean Sea currents bringing warmer surface water through the Ionian Sea
and into the Adriatic. This has the effect of mitigating the winter cold for the
coastal regions and increasing the summer humidity. The climate is one of winter
cold and heavy rainfall with a hot and dry summer. Altitude and aspect determine
the local climate.
The Institute of Hydrometeorology (1988) has subdivided the country into four
sub climatic zones. These are:
*      The southern coastal plain;
*      The central and northern coastal plain;
*      The sub-mountainous or hilly region;
*      The mountain region.
The southern coastal plain extends from Lushnje to Saranda and includes the
Elbasan valley. It is characterised by a relatively dry Mediterranean climate of hot
summers and mild wet winters. The average summer temperature is 260 C with a
humidity of 60% (for July and August). Winter average temperature is 100 C in
16



January. Average annual rainfall is 800-1300 mm, mostly in winter, with around
300 mm falling between June and September.
The central and northern coastal plain is also characterised by the Mediterranean
climate of hot dry summers and mild wet winters. Average summer temperature is
240 C. Winter is wet and there is a possibility of frost. Rainfall is high, especially in
the north, where up to 2000 mm is received.
The sub-mountain region extends, more or less parallel to the coast, from south to
north having an altitude of 800 masl. This region is dissected by rivers that flow
from east to west. The average summer temperature is 26.80 C and falls in winter
to -11' C. Frosts are frequent. Rainfall varies but on the Korce plain, the most
important agricultural area, the precipitation is only 640-800 mm, suggesting that
this area is in a rain shadow situation.
The mountain region extends above 800 masl and is characterised by a continental
climate with a summer rainfall from 600-1000mm and an annual average of
1500mm. November and December are the wettest months and July the driest.
The northern areas have a very high rainfall, up to 3000 mm/y. The summer
temperature may reach 250 C in July and winter minimum temperature may fall to
-200 C.
4.4                 Water Resources
The water resources of Albania are extensive. Winter rainfall is good, even in the
plains. Several major rivers, the Drini, Vjosa and the Semani drain from the
highlands westwards to the Adriatic. There are several large lakes, Prespa, Ohrid
and Scutary on the eastern borders. A series of coastal lagoons occur along the
Adriatic of which the Karavasta, Narta, Kune-Vain and Shkoder are perhaps the
most important. A large number of reservoirs have been constructed (630) and
groundwater is also an important resource.
4.4.1               Surface Water
(a)    Surface Water Quality
The Institute of Hydrometeorology (IHM) measure flow and monitor the water
quality at various locations, about 18 in total. The location of each station is given
in Table 4.1. Prior to 1990 the analytical data reported were devoted to evaluation
for agricultural applications. More recently additional observations have been
included (biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, phosphate and
17



suspended solids) as an aid to monitor the potential environmental quality of the
river water.

Notes: anions and cadons expressed in me/I and converted from IHM data (expressed in
mg/i) given in Table 19 of the 'State of the Environment' report for 1995-1996 (NEA
1997). Sodium and potassium were not reported and were deduced as follows: potassium
normally present in small amounts and so a token 0.1 me/I assumed. Sodium then
calculated by difference between sum of anions and sum of reported cations ie calcium,
magnesium and potassium. The electrical conductivity (EC) was not stated and this was
calculated by dividing the sum of the total cations by 10. Dissolved oxygen, biological
oxygen demand and suspended solids all reported as mg/I.

As shown by Table 3.3, run off from hills and mountains can be high and the
change of gradient is considerable as the water leaves the highland and reaches the
valleys. Most rivers in the inter-montane valleys and the coastal zones are
protected with embankments to prevent flooding of the low lying adjacent alluvial
terraces where development is most intense. Most irrigation schemes are situated
in this position. Flood volumes can be high as illustrated by the data in Table 4.4
for the Seman river at Ura e Kucit (Institute of Hydrometeorology, 1985). The
run-off volume for the 10 year flood event has been estimated at more than 200
million cubic metres (MCM).

Low flows, as measured in terms of low flow exceedance probabilities, are given in
Table 4.5. The summer river flow is often insufficient and many schemes depend
upon water supplied from reservoirs. Such water may be run-off from surrounding
catchments or pumped storage supplied during the winter months.

(b)    Municipal Water Quality
Water for municipal use has been made a priority and the Government has
adopted the WHO standards for potable water (WHO, 1993), maintaining an
active sampling programme for the larger municipalities and those centres that
serve groups of villages. The Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology has
responsibility for the source water sampling widtin the distribution systems.
Parameters usually measured are residual chlorine, nitrite, nitrate, ammonia and E.
coli.
(c)    Sediment in Rivers
Measurement of sediment loads in major rivers was not a standard practice for the
IHM, nor have sediment loads been measured in canals. This situation has been
partially rectified in recent times and later reports contain some data. BCEOM
(1996) also present data obtained from the IHM. All this data is of limited value
unless the water velocity is reported and high sediment loads in the peak flow
periods (winter and spring) have little overall relevance to the irrigation diversions
that take place in the summer period, when river flow rates and suspended solids
are generally much lower. However the deposition of coarse sediment at the
intakes to many of the schemes results in considerable clearance costs at the start
of the irrigation season.
4.4.2               Groundwater
(a)    Groundwater Levels
Groundwater levels in the coastal plains fluctuate throughout the year, with
periods of recharge closely following periods of high rainfall. The IHM maintains a
series of observation wells. According to DAI (1996) groundwater resources are
generally reserved for public water supphes and extraction for irrigation is not
normally allowed. However, in several schemes where irrigation water is not
21



presently available, use is made of groundwater for irrigation of vegetables during
the summer months. Similarly, private development of groundwater for high-value
crops (vegetables) is taking place outside Tirana. The provision of irrigation water
will reduce, but not entirely replace, use of groundwater.
Monitoring of the changes in groundwater level within the irrigation sub-projects
has never been done on a routine basis. This information is important for the
interpretation of the effectiveness of drains and their actual performance
compared to design performance. High water tables in summer provide a source
of water to the crop through the process of capillary rise, very important in
situations where irrigation water is not supplied, and a factor that often enables the
farmer to achieve a modest yield of summer crop. Hidromont (1998) provide some
data on sub-soil water movement for a plot in Fier, illustraing the reaction of the
water table to irrigation with both functioning and partly functioning tertiary drains
and the impact of the plough pan restricting downward water flow. These
observations are important and help in the interpretation of water movement over,
into and through the soil. Unfortunately these measurements were restricted to the
summer months and were curtailed after one season. Regular monitoring of the
groundwater depth and quality (initially EC) has been recommended for each
subproject so that the operation of the drains can be checked and any longer term
trends detected concerning drain function, change of water quality and the possible
onset of soil salinity.
(b)    Groundwater Contamination
Contamination by nitrogen is of some concern in the rural areas where the potable
water supply is obtained from shallow wells not subject to control and analysis for
water quality. These shallow wells are used by some sub-project households and a
system of monitoring has been recommended to check groundwater water quality.
The problems of nitrate in water are common to all sub-projects, to a lesser or
greater extent, depending upon access to a piped and treated water supply.
4.5                 Sedimentation
Most rivers carry a substantial load of coarse and fine sediments that are deposited
when the gradient eases. Sedimentation from rivers is at a peak during the winter
months. Sub-scheme intake structures on these rivers are dosed at this period but
much material is left to obstruct passage of irrigation water. The high velocity of
the water (and deposited sediment) also destroys intake channels, scours the river
beds and brings about bank erosion. Considerable annual costs are incurred by
many sub-projects to clear these deposits.
22



The major irrigation canals often cross, or are close to, steeply sloping land and
interrupt the natural drainage channels. Here the control of cross drainage is a
constant challenge. Some high level canals also act as cut-off drains, collecting
rainfall run-off and sediment.
Sedimentation in the smaller irrigation channels is not too serious as the diverted
water supply has lost a lot of sediment by the time the tertiary channels are
reached.
Assessments of sediment loss from local catchments, made as part of the
environmental impact of irrigated lands in the Lushnje District (Halcrow 2001a)
revealed a generally satisfactory situation. Losses were estimated at around one
millimetre of soil depth per annum - a sustainable level.
Sedimentation into reservoirs also appears to be manageable for the sub-projects
under study.
4.6                  Land Resources
4.6.1                Introduction
The national soil map of Albania was completed in 1958. The classification
adopted was essentially a local one, adapted from the Russian system and clearly
served its intended purpose quite well, providing an overview of the land
resources, their distribution and suitability for agricultural development, based on
physical, chemical and biological properties (Zdruli, 1997). Various attempts have
been made since 1968 to reconcile the local soil classification to the intemational
systems in common use, such as the FAO system and the USDA Soil Taxonomy,
with only partial success.
4.6.2                Soils ofAlbania
The most accessible source of information available is that of Zdruli (1997) and
much more resides in the archives of several institutions dealing with soils, such as
the Soil Research Institute at Tirana and the various universities, including the
Agricultural University at Kamza on the outskirts of Tirana. This report does not
intend to deal with the entire range of Albanian soils and discussion will be
restricted to those soils specifically encountered on the irrigation schemes studied
within this project. According to Zdruli (1997) each irrigation scheme originally
was surveyed at the scale of 1:10,000 and 1:50,000 scales and reports with soil
maps and analytical data were produced. However, since this information is not
available, sketch maps at scales of 1:25,000 and 1:50,000 were used for
23



examination. Classification was at the coarsest level of Soil Orders. These maps
were classified according to the FAO Soil Map of the World legend and are
reproduced for each sub-scheme area.
4.6.3                Specfic Problems of Local Soils
(a)     Soil Fertility
The use of inorganic fertilisers is low due to the prevailing economic conditions
and farmyard manure is used as much as possible.. Farmers would like to make use
of artificial fertiliser to maintain crop nutrition and avoid crop yields decline. The
major nutrients of interest in Albania are nitrogen, phosphate and potash. Only
nitrogen and phosphate are routinely applied as potash fertiliser is considered too
expensive and the return to that fertiliser is not economic under the existing
circumstances. It is claimed that soil fertility is being degraded due to use of too
little fertiliser (Zdruli, 1997) although data to support this statement have not been
seen. The lack of fertiliser is not obvious in the commonly grown crops and visual
observation indicates moderately healthy plants, with the occasional moderate
yellowish foliage (nitrogen deficiency), but with few signs of major nutrient
disorders such as phosphate deficiency. Crops may be suffering from sub-clinical
deficiency symptoms and fertiliser inputs should, at the least, be matched with
crop removal to maintain some sort of equilibrium. Potash reserves in some of the
micaceous soils are probably good and soil mineral weathering sufficient to supply
the rather modest crop needs, but these are special circumstances. Phosphate
reserves in soil are usually not sufficient for sustainable plant growth and there is
little phosphate in farmyard manure. Phosphate is probably the most important
nutrient limiting crop growth at the present time.
(b)    Plough Pan
The problem of the existence of a plough pan in many areas of the irrigated lands
has been known for some considerable time and deep ripping of soils used to be
an operation c arried out on a five year rotational basis. This process was
discontinued after 1990, apparently for economic reasons. Hidromont (1998)
monitored the irrigation cyde at three sites (one site in each of three irrigation
schemes, notably Lushnje, Kavaje and Fier). Various soil physical and
meteorological data were determined at each site and piezometers installed to
check phreatic water levels. Soil samples were taken from depths of 30 and 60 cm
and subject to a series of tests including pF (soil moisture holding capacity), bulk
density and compaction. These investigations provided technical evidence for the
existence of a plough pan by confirmation of a high soil bulk density (1.7-1.8
g/cm3) at the 30 cm depth, accompanied by a soil compaction measurement of
24



1.7-2.0 kg/cm2. Tensiometers installed in field plots recorded little change of
moisture content at a depth of 60 cm following irrigation, indicating that applied
water was not penetrating below the 30 cm layer.
High values for soil bulk densities severely restrict downward water movement (as
shown by the piezometer studies) and root growth. The problem, which is
common in the finer textured soils of most of the sub-projects, is related to the
practice of ploughing when the soil is wet, as noted during field visits in
November. The problem can be overcome by deep ploughing (subsoiling) about
once every five years - as was done pre-1990 and avoiding, as far as possible,
ploughing when the soil is wet.
(c)    Saline (Solonchak) Soils
These soils occur on the westem lowland plains and are mainly found in low-lying
areas where the water table is close to the surface and the groundwater brackish or
saline due to influence from the sea. The local classification for saline soils is based
on salt content and three categories are distinguished:
*      slightly salty: containing 0.25 to 0.5% salt (EC 4.2 to 7.7 dS/m)
*      moderately salty: containing 0.5 to 1.0% salt (EC 7.8 to 15.4 dS/m)
*      very salty: containing greater than 1.0% salt (EC>15.4 dS/m).
The first two categories do not constitute a problem for agriculture production and
salt removal can be accomplished under the normal agricultural operations,
provided that the scheme drains are working according to design standard. The
Project will include a few small areas near the coast for rehabilitation of drainage.
Most have been excluded from the rehabilitation programme, such as the very
saline clay soils at the Vlore VLU-1 sub-project. This will facilitate the natural
restoration of coastal wetlands.
(d)    Magnesium Dominated Soils (Serpentines)
Ultramafic rocks and serpentinites occur in many parts of the world and are
conspicuous for their unusual vegetation, characteristically lacking in the variety of
species and numbers of plants (Krause, 1958). These ultrabasic rocks consist of
iron-magnesium silicates that, following weathering, produce soils having high
values for exchangeable magnesium, generally exceptionally low values for
exchangeable calcium and smectite (montmorilloriites) as the typical clay minerals.
Such soils are usually deficient in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus,
molybdenurn deficiency can occur. The heavy metals nickel, iron and chromium
25



often attain high values in soil and associated plants. Some plants accumulate very
high concentrations of nickel (the accumulator plants). Albania has large areas of
ultrabasic rocks and many magnesium rich soils, often called smonitsa soils.
There are also cracking clay soils in Albania that exhibit all the characteristic s of
Vertisols and contain high amounts of exchangeable magnesium. They have been
classified as smonitsa (and by implication serpentine soils) and yet are not
characteristic serpentine soils since they appear to lack the ubiquitous high
concentrations of nickel and chromium.
(e)    Peat (Organic) Soils
Peat soils are common within the lower lying lands of the coastal plain and in other
places where swamps and marsh previously existed. The anaerobic decomposition
of swamp vegetation (Juncus, Typha, Augustifola, Scirpus and Salix sp.) resulted in the
formation of thick deposits of organic litter and eventually peat. The thickness of
the peat layer varies from 50 to 150cm with even deeper layers present in some
areas. The Maliq swamp area near Korce has up to 8 metres depth of peat.
Drainage of the land and the lowering of the water table have resulted in the
oxidation of much peat, accelerated by the disturbance of land due to cultivation.
The former swamp at Maliq has all gradations from mineral soils with an organic
rich layer merging into extensive deposits of peat in the low-lying central area. The
peats are reasonably fertile with plenty of nitrogen, although incorporated into the
organic material and not readily available to plants. Phosphate status is moderate,
as is potash. Some zinc deficiencies have been observed. The peat is slightly to
moderately acid in reaction (pH 5.5 to 6.0), has good permeability to air and water,
with a bulk density less than 1.0g/cm3 and can absorb water up to ten times their
weight. The soils are friable and easily cultivated.
The peats are poorly drained and ponded water is common during the winter
months. Groundwater may be just below the surface or even above the land level.
The underlying silts and clays are very poorly drained at all times, are a dark grey in
colour and bacterial reduction dominates soil forming processes. Reduction
extends into the waterlogged peat and a strong smell of hydrogen sulphide was
encountered during field inspections in November.
Groundwater tables are shallow and (according to Plaku et al, 1999) at the end of
the dry season (October 1995) it was at 150 cm depth in the unburnt peat land and
120 cm in adjacent burnt areas. The following March (1996), at the end of the wet
26



season, the watertable depths wete respectively 30 cm below ground level and
above ground level.
The peat lands a Maliq originally occupied around 2000 ha although that area has
decreased significantly over the past fifty years, pardy as a result of cultivation and
natural oxidation of the organic matter. The most catastrophic reduction of the
volume of peat has resulted from fire, mainly due to burning of crop residues in
the field. These incidents have taken place in scattered areas so that the resultant
micro-relief is now undulating and the surface difficult to cultivate and to drain.
The land now consists of a complex pattern of natural peat, partially burned and
completely burned areas. The best estimate of the probable area of peat remaining
is 1200-1500 ha. The ash content of the peat varies from 15 to 20% (Plaku et al,
1999). Some data on the peat and adjacent soils are given in Table 4.6.

The burnt peat, essentially a mnixture of oxides of the various non-volatile
components of the peat, has the highest pH, base saturation, bulk density and
specific gravity. The organic matter, total nitrogen and phosphate contents are also
low, as one would expect. There is very little difference in the cation exchange
capacity (CEC), which is somewhat surprising, as the organic matter has been
significantly reduced in the burnt peat areas. This ash still provides a satisfactory
medium for plant growth and wheat planted in the winter of 2000 germinated and
the young plants were growing as well as those in other, unburnt, parts of the
fields.
27



(f)    Soil Erosion
Soil erosion problems in Albania are not new. The erosion of the uplands was
exacerbated in the 1930s by deforestation for fuel wood and the widespread
herding of sheep and goats (Mason, 1945). Significant strides were made in
reforestation between 1950 and 1988. However the move to increase crop
production under rainfall led to expansion of cultivation onto unsuitable land that
quickly eroded despite efforts at soil conservation (Atkinson et al, 1991). The
economic circumstances of the 1990s resulted in uncontrolled removal of trees for
building purposes and fuel wood and increased grazing pressures on marginal land.
Maintenance of installed soil conservation works ceased and erosion steadily
accelerated. Not all erosion is manmade. Geological erosion is to be expected in a
country such as Albania with steep slopes, high and often intense rainfall events
and much exposed bare rock surfaces. Much of the land is geologically unstable
and landslides are common. The coast has been prograding for many years and the
coastline is estimated to have advanced by up to five kilometres since Classical
times (Pounds, 1969).
Water erosion of the soil surface is the dominant form and sheet, ril and gully
erosion is widely documented. There is some wind erosion that affects small areas
of sandy soils on the coastal plains and the peat soils of the Korce plain. The
critical erosion period is winter when the rain tends to fall as high intensity, short
duration showers. Slope angle and length in combination are the two most
important factors controlling water erosion and clearly the mountainous and hilly
lands are most at risk. The majority of the irrigation schemes are situated on the
plains and terraces of the principal river systems and erosion in the hills does not
directly affect their operation. However many schemes are situated close to steep
land and deposition of large volumes of sediment during torrent flow does affect
intake structures (e.g. Lezhe LEU-1) and increases operation and maintenance
costs.
Estimates of the quantities of soil lost from catchment areas throughout the
country range from 20 to 70 tonnes per hectare per annum (Kovaci et al, 1996).
Target figures for allowable erosion (to maintain sustainability) vary but generally
in the range from 10 to 12.5 tonnes per hectare per year. It is therefore clear that
some catchment areas need more protection and soil conservation measures need
to be implemented. Overgrazing of some of the uplands near the irrigation
schemes has resulted in some localised soil erosion. The production of increased
quantities of livestock feed as a consequence of rehabilitation is a potential solution
to at least part of the overgrazing/erosion problem.
28



Soil conservation will only succeed if the local people are fully aware and involved
in the process. A Natural Resource Management Project has been proposed by the
World Bank and, when implemented would include the participation of WUAs in
local soil conservation schemes.
4.7                 Vegetation
The variation in altitude, rainfall and geology has resulted in a marked local
vegetation and considerable species diversity. Coastal Albania is dominated by
Mediterranean flora and evergreen hard leaved vegetation. Oak woodlands in the
north give way to maquis scrub and marsh woodlands. Two vegetation regions are
recognised within the highlands. The northern Albanian mountains and the central
highlands support extensive forests of white bark pine and beech, particularly on
the limestone, with oak forest at somewhat lower altitudes. The southern highlands
consist of black pine with Greek firs, dry oak woodland and maquis scrub in the
valleys.
4.8                 Wetlands of Nature Conservation Interest
Albania possesses some of the richest biodiversity in the Mediterranean basin and
the coastal areas are particularly favoured. Irrigation development on the coastal
plains has resulted in the drainage of many former wetlands and several
developments occur near existing coastal lagoons. These coastal wetlands are
important over-wintering and stop-over sites for migratory waterfowl and other
avian species. The principal sites (NEA 1995/1996), along the coast, named from
north to south, are given in Table 4.7. Karavasta and Butrint are RAMSAR sites
and Narta is under preparation for RAMSAR status.

5                   Overview of Environmental Assessment
of First Phase Schemes
5.1                 Background
A list of the priority schemes selected during the SIDRP for completion of the
rehabilitation works during the first phase of the WRMP is given in Table 5.1
below and the location of the sub-projects is shown on Figure 5.1. These schemes
were selected on the basis of technical and environmental aspects, economic
viability, and the declared interest by stakeholders (the Water Users Associations -
WUAs) for rehabilitation and, furthermore, their agreement to provide financial
support.
Sections 6 through 12 present the results of environmental impact assessments
(EIAs) for each of the six irrigation rehabilitation projects that are being taken
forward for refurbishment in the WRMP.
5.2                 Approach to the EM
In Albania, there is little guidance on the identification of projects requiring an
EIA or the scope of an EIA. The Law on Environmental Protection (LEP) 1993
(No. 7664) prescribes the EIA process but does not define the methods for
screening which projects require an EIA, determining the scope of the EIA, or the
assessment methodology. A draft Council of Minister Decision was prepared in
1993, based on the EU Directive on EIA and elements of American law and
procedures, but the Decision was not enacted. The environmental authorities
required developers to follow Chapter 2 of the LEP, while EIAs undertaken by
International Funding Institutes (IFIs) tend follow the guidance of the IFI.
The recent and ongoing studies for irrigation and rehabilitation in Albania have
been funded by the World Bank. These projects have been classified as Category B
for the purposes of environmental assessment. Operational Directive 4.01 (World
Bank, 1991) states that a Category B project does not require a full environmental
assessment and an environmental mitigation or environmental management plan
should be sufficient.
In accordance with the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) for the Second Project
an environmental assessment of all irrigation and drainage schemes in excess of
1,000 ha is required to fulfil Ministry of Environment (MoE) and Bank procedures
30



and requirements for a classification B project. For sub-projects under 1,000 ha
implementation could proceed without an environmental assessment of the basis
that PMU verify that no environmental impacts are expected from the
rehabilitation works.
This EIA is based on guidance published by the World Bank in OP 4.01 and the
International Commission for Irrigation and Drainage (ICID), and the
requirements of EU legislation on EIA. This approach satisfies the procedures of
the Government of Albania and the World Bank for a classification B project.
5.3                 Scope ofEnvironmentalAspects
The environmental impact for each scheme cannot be considered in isolation since
the schemes are not independent, at least in environmental terms. Impacts arise in
three areas:
*      upstream of the irrigation project;
*      within the irrigation project;
*      downstream of the irrigation project.
Upstream impacts are mainly associated with the quality of the irrigation water
received at the scheme intake. In Albania many of the rivers, which form the
principal source of irrigation water, were formerly polluted with industrial effluent
although the level of pollution is now much reduced due to closure of many of the
offending factories. Urban effluent, principally raw sewage, is still discharged into
rivers from all centres. Appropriate treatment facilities are planned by various
funding agencies to reduce this problem
Occasionally environmental risks intrude such as the deposition of coarse
sediments due to erosion of watersheds upstream and erosion of riverbanks near
the intake associated with changes in bed morphology.
All potential environmental impacts have to be considered together within each
scheme in order to prepare a comprehensive environmental assessment. There are
potential direct scheme impacts such as increased crop production, increased use
of fertilisers and pesticides, human health, soil erosion, land subsidence,
salinsation, waterlogging and contamination of groundwater. Activities not directly
attributable to the scheme may affect the irrigation operations, the soil, the
groundwater and the drainage effluent. An example is the disposal of domestic
effluent into drains and the consequent public health hazards.
31



Downstream impacts will be chiefly concerned with the quality and quantity of
effluent discharged by the project back into the river system, or to the principal
drain collectors, since a lot of river (and some drain) water is re-used downstream
for irrigation.
Finally discharge of drainage effluent from the project has to be considered in
terms of its potential effect upon fisheries, wildlife or wetlands downstream.
All these aspects are discussed in more detail in later sections of this report.
5.4                 Methodology
For each sub-project, the ICID checklist recommended by the Intemational
Comnission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) was used to identify those
environmental effects that impinge upon the project (upstream effects), those
existing or interacting with the irrigation and drainage work proposed (on-site
effects) and possible downstream effects of the rehabilitation of the project
(downstream effects). A detailed questionnaire (based on the ICID checklist
suitably modified for Albanian conditions) was completed by the local consultants
prior to the field checks. Field visits were made by the international and Albanian
specialists and the project area was thoroughly inspected from the intake structures
for the water to the final drain discharge point(s). A reconnaissance was made both
upstream and downstream of the subproject, where considered necessary. Farmers
were informally interviewed. Notes were made of all potential problems related to
water, soil, agriculture and public health. Possible effects upon ecosystems or sites
of archaeological/historic interest were evaluated. These findings were compared
to the results from the socio-economic surveys. Measures to overcome predicted
problems (mitigation measures) have been recommended.

6                   Berat BRU-3
6.1                Background
The BRU-3 Berat Ura Kucit sub-project is located mainly in Berat District, and a
small part, (740 ha), in Kucove District, in central Albania. The scheme lies in
lower part of the Osumi river valley between the town of Berat and the confluence
with the Devolli River to the west of the town of Kucove. The top-end of the sub-
project lies within the suburbs of Berat town (population around 62,000).
Berat town is approximately 40 km southeast of Lushnje and from there it is
around 90 km to Tirana or 56 km to Durres port. Joumey time from Tirana to
Berat is around 3 hours along roads of reasonably good condition. Minor roads to
the south east of Berat lead into the mountainous areas in central southern
Albania.
Approximately 16 villages, within the four communes of Velabisht, Otilak, Poshnje
and Perondia-Kucove have an interest in the sub-project.
Figure 6.1 shows the key components of the scheme.
The Berat BRU-3 Ura Kucit sub-project is located on both sides of the Osumi
River in the wide alluvial plains which lie between the Shpirag Goncani hills to the
west and the Berat Kucove hills to the east. The main canal system supplied from a
barrage on the Osumi River is over 25 km long. The areas that make up the BRU-3
scheme are 3,960 ha comprising:
(a)    1,100ha from Beratto Ura Vajgurore, of which about 300 ha is supplied by
pumping stations and the remainder by gravity;
(b)    740 ha, now in Kucove District to the north east, and supplied by gravity;
(c)    2120 ha on the left bank of the Osumi river, between Ura Vajgurore and
Sheq Gadja, of which 150 ha is supplied from a pumping station and the
remainder by gravity.

The provision of water is complex in this area with a number of nearby and linked
areas supplied either from reservoirs or pumping stations. Extra features were
examined and, where appropriate, these additional areas have been included in the
proposed works. These additional areas, covering a total of 935 ha, comprise:
-   irrigation of the Uznova area upstream of BRU-3 and supplied from a free
intake on the right bank which serves 165 ha plus an additional small area
(about 120 ha) supplied from the right bank canal from a pumping station;
-   irrigation of a further 650 ha on the left bank of the Osumi River which is
supplied from a number of sources including the Sadovice reservoir and the
much smaller Manastiri and Males Grope reservoirs.
In addition, there are a large number of small pumping stations that supply
supplementary water to areas, within the command areas described above, at times
when water from the primary source of supply is inadequate.
In summary, of the 4,895 ha considered in this report, 4,325 ha are supplied by
gravity and 570 ha from small pumping stations. Of the 4,325 ha supplied by
gravity, about 1,600 ha can also be supplied from other small pumping stations
when the gravity supply is insufficient during the irrigation season. These pumping
stations are reported to be operated about 30 days per year.
This area was, under the previous regime from 1953, an agricultural cooperative
that was broken up in 1991. It was highly productive and one of the major crops
was cotton, which was processed and used for textile production. The factories
were located in Berat town. After 1991 the cotton processing equipment fell into
disrepair and is now only operating on a very limited scale. Farmers now grow a
range of crops, primarily for home consumption.
6.2                Description of the Rehabilitation Works
The rehabilitation requirements were based on the findings of the condition survey
by SELAS and visits to the sub-project area by the Consultants. The rehabilitation
works that were originally proposed comprised the following sections of the
irrigation sub-project BRU-3 (3,960 ha) and the adjacent areas (935 ha):
-   minor rehabilitation to the main barrage structure across the Osumi River,
-   rehabilitation of the right bank intake structure,
-   repairs to the suspension bridge crossing over the Osumi River,
36



-   irrigation canal earthworks to restore profiles and capacity,
-   concrete lining of main canals and about 60% of secondary and sub-
secondary canals,
-   repair/reconstruction of gates and cross regulators,
-   renovation of aqueducts, culverts, siphons and other associated structures,
- rehabilitation of the intake structures and associated works on the Manastiri,
Malas Grope and Sadovice reservoirs,
-   rehabilitation of five pumping stations which operate throughout the
irrigation season and thirteen which are used for pumping supplementary
irrigation water in the latter part of the irrigation season,
-   improvement to access roads, rehabilitation of bridges and construction of
new bridges.
The proposed rehabilitation works of the drainage sub-projects BRK1 and BRK2
(3,960 ha) were completed during the SIDRP. The outstanding works comprise a
few remaining secondary canals.
6.3                Present Environmental Situation
6.3.1              Irrgation WaterQualiy
Irrigation water quality from the Osumi and Devolli Rivers is extremely good, with
very low EC (0.3-0.5 dS/m), TDS (240-340 mg/1) and SAR (0.4-0.7) values.
6.3.2               Soil Saliniy and Toxiaiy
No saline soils are present in the sub-project areas. No areas of other major
problem soils occur within the immediate confines of the sub-project areas.
6.3.3               Drainage Water Qualhy
The drains within this project eventually discharge into the Osumi river that joins
with the river Devolli within the scheme area to become the river Semani. The
Semani water is used downstream to irrigate other lands.
Hunting et al (1998a) confirmed that irrigation water quality was good (EC 0.3 to
0.6 dS/m) and also that drain water in the autumn period (sampling September
1998) was in the range 0.4 to 0.6 dS/m, presumably a wetter year than 2003.
The drainage water quality was monitored in 2003: the sampling points are given
on Figure 6.1 and the laboratory data in Table 6.1. The salinity data collected
37



during this recent monitoring exercise confirmed Hunting's results and showed
that, even in a dry year, the drain waters (EC 0.6-1.79 dS/m) are not particularly
saline and all could be reused directly for irrigation, although in most cases the
drain water is diluted by river water before reuse.
Table 6.1:      Berat BRU-3 Drain Water Salinity
Sample    Location                          Salinity (dS/m)
Spring    Summer    Autumn
1         Shahinova Main Drain (Sheq-Gajde)  0.56     ns        ns
2         Shahinova Main Drain (Manastir)   0.70      ns        ns
3         Frashnjote Drain                  1.79      ns        ns
4         Perroi Gorraj Drain               0.90      ns        ns
Nitrate (0.01 mg/1) and phosphate (0.01 mg/1) concentrations in the drain water
are very low, with the exception of Sample 3 where both nutrients are somewhat
higher (nitrate 3.64 and phosphate 2.26 mg/1) well above the general range in
values, suggesting local contamination by sewage.
Drain water will be diluted by the river, further reducing a salt and agrochemical
content that is already low. There are no measurable environmental impacts
downstream.
6.4                 Without Project Future
Summer cropping without water will remain very restricted except for those lands
close to the river where it may be possible to abstract some water. In dry years
even the drains do not flow (as in 2003). The farmers grow a lot of vegetables for
the nearby market at Korce and use of drain water, often contaminated by sewage,
will continue to pose a health hazard to consumers.
6.5                Environmental Impact of the Proposed Rehabilitation Works
6.5.1              Impacts During Construction
The remaining engineering work s are modest and will be constructed using small
scale plant and local manual labour. These works will cause some disturbance,
noise and dust. The disturbance to passage of traffic will be small due to the scale
of operations and only relatively small excavation equipment will be involved.
Noise and dust will be limited and may affect the workers more than the
inhabitants as the majority of the construction work will be outside the villages.
38



Local labour will be employed and there will not be any clash of cultures.
Supply of construction materials will be sub-contracted to outside individuals who
will deliver the quantities necessary for, at most, one or two days work. There will
be little or no stockpiling of aggregates or fuel.
Construction will result in the creation of solid waste that will removed from site
and dumped at an approved site (either by agreement with the local administration
or with the regional environmental officer). All of these impacts will be of a
temporary nature and will cease on the completion of the works.
6.5.2               Impacts During Operation
(a)     Upstream Impact
There are no significant upstream impacts.
Sediment has accumulated around the barrage structure, flood debris has been
deposited on the steel superstructure and there is scour damage downstream of the
piers of the dam. Consequently the presence of these structures is affecting the
river morphology locally.
(b)    Within Scheme Impact
There will be an increase in agricultural production, particularly in the summer
months that will be accompanied by an increase in the overall quantity of
agrochemnicals applied annually. This increase is estimated to be moderate as the
type of crops that will be grown will be the same as presently grown. The
application of fertiliser and pesticides will also be restricted by the socio-economic
status of the local farmers.
The irrigation efficiency will not be markedly improved so the salt burden of the
drain water will remain about the same as at present. The concentration of fertiliser
and pesticide residues in the drain water will increase slightly above present levels.
The increase in the supply of water will mean more water in drains and dilution
and flushing of sewage components. It will also mean that less water will be used
for irrigation, both from the drains and from the groundwater resource.
39



(c)    Downstream Impact
The drain water from the scheme will continue to have a quality suitable directly
for reuse downstream. Any pollutants are effectively diluted when discharged back
into the river system so the resultant downstream effect is negligible.
6.6                 Mitigation Measures
There will be regular inspection and clearing of debris and sediment from canals
and drains.
The increased agricultural activity will result in the increased use of agrochemicals
and the inevitable loss of agrochemicals, particularly nitrate and pesticide, to drains
or groundwater. These impacts will be offset by the introduction of the best
agricultural practice training programme. Specifically this will involve:
*   Deep ploughing to break up the plough pan to improve water infiltration
and crop aeration.
*   Farmer education concerning the storage, handling, application and
disposal of pesticide residues and containers
*   Farmer education concerning the problem of nitrates in water and
potential health effects.
*   Community agreement to limit nitrate applications to crops.
*   Storage and handling of farm yard manure
6.7                 The Monitoring Programme
The proposed monitoring requirements have been kept to a minimum consistent
with the need to monitor those aspects identified as critical for public health (well
water quality, drain water quality), and those that will give information and possible
early warning of trends that will affect longer term sustainability (water table
behaviour and salinity). Irrigation water quality from the Devoll and Osum rivers is
good and it is not necessary to check. The location of the water table monitoring
sites and the sampling sites for irrigation and drain water collection are shown in
Figure 6.2. The annual monitoring programme is summarised in Table 6.2.
40



6.7.1               Public Health
(a)    Drainage canals
Six sites have been selected. The locations are shown in Figure 6.2. The actual sites
will be determined in relation to the villages - both upstream and downstream
sample sites are needed. Analysis will be done for the determinands EC,
phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and faecal coliform. Samples will be
collected according to the requirements of the public health laboratory. Samples
will be taken in April and September of each year.
(b)    Well waters
Six wells have been chosen according to the locations shown in Figure 6.2. The
actual sites will be determined by a field visit and discussion with the farmers.
Analysis will be done for the determinants EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite,
ammonium and faecal coliform. Samples will be collected according to the
requirements of the public health laboratory. Samples will be taken at six month
intervals in April and September each year.
6.7.2              Scheme Water Tables
Water table observation pipes will be installed at 6 sites, according to the locations
show in Figure 6.2. The location of the pipe must be with the consent of the
landowner who should be asked to take responsibility for its protection from
interference. Water table depth will be measured at three month intervals during
the months of September, December, March and June. Water samples will be
collected and analysed for EC only.
6.8                 Conclusions
Overall the net environmental impact of this scheme would be positive, raising
crop production and farm incomes, and will be economically and environmentally
sustainable provided that the designated mitigation measures are followed. The
rehabilitation would improve the socio-economic status of the farmers
considerably provided that the various mitigation measures are implemented. In
addition the improved availability of water in the summer months would flush the
drains and reduce the health hazard due to disposal of sewage. The scheme
produces a significant amount of vegetables for the nearby town of Berat and
provision of irrigation water would reduce the tendency to use polluted drain water
for irrigation. Negative impacts can be offset, or reduced, by engineering
interventions and/or improved farming practices. The scheme does not affect
cultural values and it would greatly increase the quality of life of the local people.

7                   Fier FRU-3
7.1                Background
The FRU-3 irrigation scheme and FRK-7 and 8 drainage schemes are located in
the Fier District in central Albania and were constructed in stages between 1950
and 1970 to supply most of the agricultural area in east Fier District. Irrigation
water is supplied by pumping from the Semani river and gravity from Kurjami
reservoir.
The scheme covers an area of 6400 ha of which some 70% is currently cultivated
for the production of low value grain and fodder crops. However, there are
significant areas of vegetable production for the market of Fier. Large areas where
water is not available are cultivated under rainfed conditions.
An estimated 4225 ha net is under gravity command of the Kurjani Reservoir. This
is subdivided into four distinct command areas, LB (left bank) 1, 2, and 3, and RB
(right bank). The net area fed by direct pumping from Gorrican is 1870 ha. The
LB3 area is also supplemented by a small pump station at Belina, which feeds 150
1/s directly into the V4 canal.
An area of about 800 ha of the original subproject was found to be severely
affected by pollution from leaking oil wells. This area was excluded from the
present study since it required specialist rehabilitation treatment. However, certain
parts of the irrigation and drainage system pass through the area and require some
limited engineering work for rehabilitation and protection from surface spread of
crude oil. The V4 canal runs across it from Marineza to Belina and feeds the
Kurjani LB3 area of 375 ha. The Roskoveci-Hoxhare Collector Drain traverses the
area and is contaminated with crude oil downstream of the Marineza Pump station.

7.2                Description of the Rehabilitation Works
This section describes the works that were intended to be undertaken under the
SIDRP. Parts of these works were completed under that Project and the remaining
works will be completed under the Water Resource Management Project.
The SIDRP proposed to rehabilitate the main canals, main drains, provide
protection works to vulnerable areas to prevent damage from the Semani River
and rehabilitate 5 pump stations. Canal and drain structures and canal lining would
also be rehabilitated.
Some works were considered to be essential for the continued operation of the
scheme. These essential works are not complex or expensive but without them the
system would remain largely inoperable as at present. These works are:
*      Restoration of Matke Pumping Station.
*      Rehabilitation of S hequi and Marinze Drainage Pumping Stations
*      Repairs to Cerveni - Kurjani feeder canal.
All other works proposed are less complex in nature including canal lining, de-
silting, and replacement of minor structures. Although as many of these as possible
will be constructed under the rehabilitation programme, some of this work could
be carried out under a rolling programme of maintenance to give a steady
improvement in the overall scheme as funds become available.
The main and the secondary canals are in many places filled with sediment and
have damaged sections, damaged lining and destroyed structures. Seepage is
significant in hilly areas where soils tend to be permeable. The project proposed to
rehabilitate the canals and structures to their original condition, with concrete
lining extended to all main and secondary canals. Where precast slabs have been
used for lining, these have in many places been stolen. In situ concrete lining will be
used as replacement.
The V6B canal will be shortened by about 2.3 km from its existing route, in order
to by-pass the urban area of Fier city. An inverted siphon will convey the canal
across the main road and a depression.
Earthworks consist mainly of de-silting and re-sectioning canals and drains.
Elsewhere on the scheme, excavation is limited to removing sediment and flood
debris from structures such as siphons and culverts.
47



Secondary canals are extensively damaged and need significant work in
remodelling. The total volume of excavation is estimated at 127,000 m3.
Mass concrete lining is proposed for all main and secondary canals, and all canals
that pass through village or urban areas. Standard design is Ml 50 concrete,
thickness 10-15 cm, with 1:1 side slopes. The total volume of concrete required for
canal lining is estimated at 34,000 m3.
Structures are extensively damaged or have been demolished. It is planned to
repair all 468 existing structures and build 314 new ones where necessary. The
majority of new structures will be gated outlets, of which in total 177 are proposed.
The main access routes are generally in good condition. Most gravel roads within
the project area are adequate and no significant improvements are proposed, other
than repair or reconstruction of bridges and culverts. New bridges are induded
where there is a demonstrable need. These are normally simple concrete slabs
spanning the canals. A total of 166 bridges are proposed for repair or renewal.
Drain rehabilitation will comprise resectioning, repair and replacement of
structures, with special arrangements for disposal of contaminated spoil.
Excavation works for resectioning the main and secondary drainage canals is
estimated at 530,000 m3, with 1880 m3 of concrete for lining and 72,000 m3 of
contaminated material to be transported. In addition 110 structures, mainly
bridges and culverts, will be repaired or replaced.
The left bank of Seman River is induded in scheme FRK-7 rehabilitation. In the
area of Samatic-Jagodine the bank is damaged by erosion and it is necessary to
repair and improve the existing protection works. It is proposed to carry out bank
reinstatement (filling and compaction), construction of 4 new concrete revetment
panels and repairs to existing panels.
It was only possible, under SIRDP, to rehabilitate the main canal from the Kurjan
reservoir and the main drains VMK, VMK-1, and VMK-2.
7.3                 Present Environmental Situation
One subproject is the rehabilitation of the irrigation scheme for FRU-1 and two
sub-projects concern the drainage rehabilitation schemes FRK-7 and FRK-8. All
the irrigated land in FRU-1 will also have drain rehabilitation so the area of FRU-1
48



is the same as the total of FRK-7 and FRK-8. The irrigation scheme was
constructed in stages over the period between 1950 and 1970. Soil erosion in the
uppet catchment area of the Devolli results in a high sediment load in the river at
high flow periods when the irrigation system does not function. Clearly sediment
loads are lower during the summer months of reduced rainfall and water velocity.
The intake requires annual cleaning to remove sediments. The river banks are also
subject to erosion. A large dam (the Banja dam) is being constructed upstream and
will be completed within the next five years. This will result in an attenuation of
flood volumes and reduced sediment loads at the intake.
Petroleum deposits were known to extend under the scheme area and oil field
development started within the scheme during 1957. The development was very
intensive and many production wells were established in and around the former
scheme, between the river Seman and the foothills on the southern periphery.
The original proposition for rehabilitation of the irrigation system was amended.
An area of about 800 ha suffers from gross pollution of land or drain
infrastructure and so this area was excluded from the subproject leaving a net area
of 6200 ha.
Rehabilitation within that exclusion zone was limited to repair and protection of
the main irrigation or drain feeders that need to cross the area to connect to
otherwise separated parts of the irrigation subproject.
7.3.1               The Water Resource
The sub-project FRU-3 and the associated drainage sub-projects FRK-7 and
FRK-8 are situated on the left bank of the river Seman to the east of the town of
Fier.
7.3.2              Imgation Water
The planned irrigation water sources are by abstraction from the Seman river by
pump stations at Gorrican and Belina with additional storage and rainfall collection
from the Kurjan reservoir. The IHM maintain a river monitoring station for the
Seman at Mbrostar situated at the downstream end of the sub-project area. This
station is below the scheme water abstraction intakes. The Devoll river and the
Osum river combine near Kucova to form the Seman. The IHM have monitoring
stations on the Devoll at Kozare and on the Osum at Ura Vajgurore. The chemical
analyses of these waters, published by the NEA (2000) have been used to assess
the water quality of the Seman for irrigation within sub-project FRU-3. There is
49



liniited water quality data available for the Kurjan reservoir that indicates it is
suitable for irrigation. The analytical data are reproduced in Table 7.1 below.
Table 7.1:      Water Chemistry of the Devoll and Osum rivers and the
Kurian Reservoir
River    Ca   Mg     Na    K     HCO3    Cl    S04    EC     SAR    pH
Devoll   0.9  2.4    3.3   0.1   4.9     0.8   1.0    0.7    2.5    8.5
Osum    0.9   1.3    4.6   0.1   4.8     0.8   1.3    0.7    4.6    8.0
Kurjan   2.0  2.2    Na    0.1   na      0.6   na     na     na     na
Note: anions and cations are expressed in me/litre.
The two river waters have a similar chemical composition, with the Osum
containing slightly more sodium than the Devoll. The Devoll has a larger
catchment area (and flow volume) than the Osum and so, after mixing, the
dominant water will be that characteristic of the Devoll.
The Kurjani re servoir is expected to provide the majority of the irrigation water
and since the water is basically a mix of Semani river water and local catchment
run-off then it is reasonable to assume that water quality is similar to that in the
Seman.
Although irrigation water is of a good quality, at the present time there would be
insufficient water to meet the needs of the peak summer demand for the crops at
full project development.
The Kurjani reservoir is an off-stream storage facility supplied, in part, by a
pumped diversion from the main canal through the Matke Pump Station and a
gravity canal supply from the Cerveni dam.
7.3.3               Drain lWater
The sub-project has only a very limited supply of irrigation water at present. All
drain water eventually drains into the Roscovice Collector, the main spinal drain
within the sub-project that eventually discharges into the Adriatic Sea. Scheme
water efficiency, under the brazda system, will be low and a large proportion of the
applied water will run across the soil surface and directly into the field drains.
Consequently, since the soils are non-saline the collected field drain water, both
run-off and soil drainage, will have a composition not dissimilar to that of the
applied irrigation water. Domestic raw sewage generally goes to sumps (cess pits)
although some is discharged directly into the drain system. Children play and fish
50



in the drains. Domestic waste discharge is small compared to the quantity of water
passing along the drains and so will be well diluted and overall quality at the point
of discharge to the main drain will probably be adequate. The environmental
concern here must be related to the health of the rural population within the
scheme.
Pesticide and fertiliser use is low because the farmers, for reasons of cost, are
normally applying the minimum doses necessary to maintain a satisfactory crop
production. The quantities of nitrogen and phosphate entering the drain are low,
as confirmed by the 2003 monitoring programme (Halcrow, 2003). Monitoring was
restricted to measurement of salinity, phosphate and nitrate in selected drains. The
sampling sites are indicated on Figure 5.2 and the salinity data are given in Table
7.2.
Table 7.2:      Fier FRU-3; FRK -7/8 Drain Water Salinity
Sample    Location                           Salinity (dS/m)
Spring  Summer    Autumn
1         Drain K30                          1.18    NS        NS
2         Drain (Shekult Pump Station)       2.30    NS        NS
3         Drain K31                          1.04    NS        NS
The drain water quality is good with low salinity (1.0-1.2 dS/m), low phosphate
(O.Olmg/l), and low nitrate content (O.lmg/l), and does not present any problem
downstream.
7.3.4              Soils and Agriculture
The scheme is situated within the valley of the river Semani and the soils are
mairly developed from alluvial sediments of Quaternary to Recent age. The soils
exhibit a range of textures that reflect the age and depositional sequence of
sediment from river waters moving across a floodplain. The most recent sediments
are coarse textured sands to sandy loams and are deposited nearest to the river
channel. Behind the levees the sediments are finer textured (silt loam to silty clay
loam) on the cover flood plain with the finest textures (silty clay to clay) in the
backswamp areas where river water originally ponded against the hill slopes. The
soils are calcareous with a pH in the range 7.5-8.0. Salinity is not a problem.
51



A plough pan exists in most of the medium to fine textured soils and the soil, at a
depth of 20 to 30 cm, is compacted and has a high bulk density such that root
penetration and water movement are impeded. The consequence is that irrigation
water and rainfall are not penetrating (or only penetrating slowly) below the 30 cm
depth and substantial run off occurs under intense rainfall, contributing to the
surface drainage problem. A regular programme of sub-soiling to a depth of 30 to
40 cm will improve water entry and root elongation.
The brazda system of irrigation is inefficient unless the flow of water is carefully
supervised (the conservative estimate of irrigation efficiency is only 40%) and
particularly so where a plough pan is present. Most incident water (including rain)
flows to drains, carrying away a portion of any applied fertiliser, of which nitrogen
fertilisers are the most vulnerable.
Pesticide use is extremely low, as most crops presently are grown on rainfall
(winter) and the summer crops depend upon residual soil moisture, supplemented
in part by subsurface irrigation and intermittent summer rain.
Fertiliser applications are low and at the best, fertiliser and manure application may
just balance removal by the crops.
7.3.5               Socio-Economic Conditions
The waste disposal situation within the sub-project is most unsatisfactory since
there is no organised collection and disposal programme for domestic rubbish.
Household waste litters road verges, fields, villages, drainage and irrigation canals.
It is unsightly and unsanitary as well as contributing to scheme water distribution
and drainage problems. Domestic sewage disposal to drains presents a potential
health hazard to children, collectors of frogs and fish and others. Some 80% of
households dispose of sewage to unlined cess pits and the remainder to drains.
Water for domestic use is supplied to some villages through a piped distribution
system. The socio-economic studies did not record any households connected to a
piped water supply for domestic use. Of the households surveyed 86% rely upon
water abstracted from private or shared wells. The location of wells and cess pits in
the same vicinity, gives rise to some concem regarding possible pollution of the
well water supply. Provided the wells are deep and are well sealed then
contamination from cess pits should not be a problem.
52



7.4                 Without Project Future
The scheme will continue much as at present with winter crop production based
on rainfall and crop losses due to waterlogging - a common problem, particularly
in the western sector beyond Shequista. Summer crop production, apart from the
very limited areas that receive some irrigation water, will be limited to growth from
stored soil moisture, some sub-irrigation where the water table is shallow and the
occasional summer rain shower. There will be economic pressure to irrigate
summer vegetable crops using any water source available, including sewage
polluted drain water, with a consequent public health hazard. Some farmers may be
forced to dig shallow wells for irrigation.
7.5                 Environmental Impact of the Proposed Rehabilitation Works
The overall environmental impact of rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage
infrastructure would be positive as far as agriculture is concerned and the project
would be economically sustainable over the long term, provided that the
recommended mitigation measures are implemented and that sufficient money is
available to ensure timely routine maintenance of irrigation and drainage scheme
infrastructure. However social tensions are likely to develop if the irrigation water
cannot be distributed in such a manner that all stakeholders receive an equal share.
Disputes over water at the irrigation scheme level and between schemes and other
users will be monitored during the course of the Project.
7.5.1               Construction Impacts
The remaining engineering work s are modest and will be constructed using small
scale plant and local manual labour. These works will cause disturbance, noise and
dust. Disturbance to passage of traffic will be small due to the scale of operations.
Noise and dust will affect the workers more than the inhabitants as the majority of
the construction work will be outside the villages. Construction will result in the
creation of solid waste that will be removed from site and dumped. All of these
impacts will be of a temporary nature and will cease on the completion of the
works.
7.5.2               Operational Impacts
(a)    Upstream
Technically at present there is insufficient water to irrigate all the command area.
However, due to agronomic constraints, it is expected that only 80% of the land
will be brought into cultivation. The build up to full development will take about
five years. During this time it is estimated that the Banja Dam will become
operational, and will provide any additional water that may be needed.
53



The intakes on the Semani River remain vulnerable to damage from floods and
deposition of sediments.
The river banks are also liable to further erosion, a situation that will be improved
to a certain extent following commissioning of the Banja Dam and attenuation of
the river flow.
Some crude oil from production wells, situated outside and at a higher elevation
than the scheme, will continue to seep downslope and theV4 irrigation canal is
vulnerable to contamination.
(b)    Within Scheme Impacts
There will be an increase in agricultural production, particularly in the summer
months that will be accompanied by an increase in the overall quantity of
agrochemicals applied annually. This increase is estimated to be moderate as the
type of crops that will be grown will be the same as presently grown. Use of
ferti]iser and pesticides will also be restricted by the socio-economic status of the
local farmers.
The irrigation efficiency will not be markedly improved so the salt burden of the
drain water will remain about the same as at present. The concentration of fertiliser
and pesticide residues in the drain water will increase slightly above present levels.
The increase in the supply of water will mean more water in drains and dilution
and flushing of sewage components. Less water will be taken from drains and
groundwater. Some public health concerns will remain however.
The irrigation canals that cross the oil fields will have to be inspected at regular
intervals to ensure that crude oil is not entering the system.
(c)    Downstream
The water draining from the cropped land is expected to remain relatively salt free
and with low concentrations of fertiliser and pesticide residues. All drain water
drains to the Roscovice Collector and is eventually discharged into the sea. Drain
water, representing rainfall runoff, oil field brines and crude oil, is emptied into the
Collector at the Marinza pump station. The resultant mixture is not suitable for any
reuse purpose whatsoever.
54



7.6                Mitigation Measures
The following engineering mitigation measures wil be implemented:
*      Small river bank protection works.
*      Canal protection works from oil spillage. These consist of the provision of
covers for the channels in those sections at risk to contamination. These
covers will be installed as part of the final rehabilitation of the scheme.
Other mitigation measures to be implemented are:
*      Regular inspection and clearance of debris from canals and drains and
culverts
*      Application of improved farming practices including:
*      Deep ploughing to break up the plough pan to improve water
infiltration and crop aeration.
*      Farmer education concerning the storage, handling, application
and disposal of pesticide residues and containers
*      Farmer education concerning the problem of nitrates in water and
potential health effects.
*      Community agreement to limit nitrate applications to crops.
*      Storage and handling of farm yard manure
7.7                 The Monitoring Programme
The water supply quality (the Devoll and Osum rivers) is monitored (and has been
for many years) by the Institute of Hydrometeorology - there is no need to
duplicate such work. The proposals for further monitoring are outlined below and
summarised in Table 7.3.
7.7.1               Public Health
NMonitoring within the scheme (now confined to those lands not polluted by crude
oil) has been confined to those aspects likely to affect the general health of the
scheme residents.
(a)    Drainage canals
Six sites will be selected. The locations are shown in Figure 7.2, the actual site will
be determined in relation to the villages-both upstream and downstream sample
sites are needed. Analysis to be carried out for the determinants EC, phosphate,
nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and faecal coliform. Samples will be collected according
55



to the requirements of the public health laboratory. Samples will be taken at
approximately six month intervals in April and September of each year.
(b)    Normal well waters
Six wells will be chosen according to the locations shown in Figure 7.2. The actual
sites will be determined by a field visit and discussion with the farmers to select
wells that are shared by four families and two that are individually owned. The
analytical work will measure the determinands EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite,
ammonium and faecal coliform. The samples will be collected according to the
requirements of the public health laboratory. The samples will be taken at six
month intervals in April and September each year.
7.7.2               Scheme Water Tabler
Water table observation pipes will be installed at ten sites, according to the
locations shown in Figure 7.2. The water table depth will be measured at three
month intervals during the months of September, December, March and June. The
Water will be sampled and analysed for EC.
7.8                 Conclusions
Overall the environmental impact of this scheme would be positive, raising crop
production and farm income. There is a strong demand for this scheme and the
farmers have reacted enthusiastically to form WUAs. The rehabilitation would
improve the socio-economic status of the farmers considerably provided that the
various mitigation measures are implemented. In addition the improved availability
of water in the summer months would flush the drains and reduce the health
hazard due to disposal of sewage. The scheme produces a large amount of
vegetables for the nearby town of Fier and provision of irrigation water would
reduce the tendency to use polluted drain water for irrigation. Negative impacts
can be offset, or reduced, by engineering interventions and/or improved farming
practices. The scheme does not affect cultural values and on the contrary it would
greatly increase the quality of life of the locality.

Korce Gjanci KOU-1
Background
This sub-project (KOU-1) is located in Korce District the most easterly district
within the country and is close to both Greece and Macedonia. The sub-project
hes in a south westerly to north easterly plain and the city of Korce lies on its
eastern side.
The sub-project area lies within the four communes of Mollaj, Drenove, Voskop
and Bulgarec, within which there are 21 villages as shown on Figure 8.1.
It is a traditional wedge-shaped irrigation scheme for those located at the top end
of a valley, approximately 12 km from the head to the tail end; it is approximately 9
km wide at the lower end.
A good spinal road runs up through the entire length of the sub-project, with
reasonable connections to the numerous villages most of which lie along the edges
of the irrigation area, and to the others located within the area itself. There is good
access to the reservoir from which the sub-project obtains its water supply.
The nominal gross area of the main sub-project area is 6,050 ha having taken
account of drains, canals, access roads and other infrastructure, the net area
available for cultivation is approximately 5,445 ha.
Of the gross area, 2,570 ha lies on the left bank and 3,480 ha lies on the right.
Included within this area are two small systems, KOU-1-2/9, Boboshtica (300 ha)
and KOU-1-2/10 Mborje (70 ha); the net area is estimated at 333 ha. These are
located above the gravity command area and depend on pumped water supply
from the right bank canal; they are situated on the valley slopes behind and close
to Korce city. The costs of rehabilitating the required pumps have been included;
the heads for these are 40 m and 50 m for Boboshtica and Mborje respectively.

Approximately mid-way down the left bank is an area of around 1,100 ha where a
sprinkler system was installed some years ago. Most of the sprinklers no longer
operate, but the main pipe system can be made to operate and distribute water to
command the area, by gravity flow. The rehabilitation of the main pipe distribution
system has been costed in the overall estimate, but no provision has been included
to cover rehabilitation of the sprinkler system.
At the head of the scheme is an area of 120 ha gross, (108 ha net), supplied by a
small canal near Floqi. This has also been included in the overall study as part of
the right bank area.
The whole area is part of the KOK-1 drainage scheme, whose total served area is
17,600 ha and covers the KOU-1 area plus three other large-scale irrigation
schemes. Drainage is not a major problem, as there are generally good slopes
within the sub-project, but, in certain locations, drainage requires attention to
protect the irrigation infrastructure.
8.2                Description of the Rehabilitation Works
The rehabilitation requirements have been based on the findings of the detailed
condition survey visits to the sub-project and our studies. They take account,
where appropriate, of suggestions by representatives from the relevant WJUAs
where these have been forthcoming.
The proposed works are as follows:
-   Rehabilitation of the 6.5 km long supply canal to its design capacity of 3 m3/s,
from its intake on the Osumi River to the Gjanc reservoir;
-   Minor improvements to the Gjanc reservoir to include: extension of the wave
walls at both dams; erosion repairs at the main dam; drainage works at the
main dam and subsidiary dam; refurbishment of the overflow; and
miscellaneous minor works;
-   Rehabilitation of the intake and supply tunnel (1.64 km long, horseshoe
shaped to a capacity of 4 m3/s) to include re-profiling and lining (subject to
checks on peak water demands);
-   Rehabilitation of the main supply canal improved lining and repair of
masonry walls to same capacity as the tunnel;
-   Minor repairs to the penstock and hydro-electric plant;
61



-   Rehabilitation of the left bank main canal (25.9 km long, capacity 1.5 m3/s)
and subject to checks on peak water demands and associated siphons,
aqueducts, cross drainage and associated control and measuring structures;
-   Rehabilitation of the right bank supply canal (16.7 km long, capacity 2.5 m3/s)
and associated siphons, aqueducts, cross drainage and associated control and
measuring structures;
-   Reconstruction and complete re-fit of pumping stations, at Boboshtica
(serving 300 ha) and Morje (serving 70 ha) (if considered worthwhile);
-   Restoration of the underground piped irrigation network (system M6, M7, M8
and M9 with 12.5 km of main supply pipes) to serve a surface irrigation
network in the area of Polena, Voskop, Goskove e Poshtme and part of
Qatrom; (provision for future development of distribution pipework to serve
hand-move sprinkler system of 1,100 ha would be made possible but actual
implementation would depend on the formation and initiatives of farmer
organisations);
-   Rehabilitation of secondary canals (85.6 km), addition of new control and
measuring structures and gated outlets to tertiary canals;
-   Restoration of tertiary canals in areas not recently irrigated and to be brought
back under command of the rehabilitated system;
-   Minor repairs to lining and siphon on the recently constructed canal (built in
1995-96) which supplies the Flogi area;
-   Improvements to canal access roads.
Most of the proposed works were completed under the SIDRP. The outstanding
works comprise the rehabilitation of secondary canals and will be undertaken
under the Water Resources Management project.
8.3                 Present Environmental Situation
8.3. 1              Water Resources
Irrigation water is abstracted from the Dunavecit river and also from the Gjanci
reservoir, the water source for the reservoir is the Osumi river. All drainage water
is returned to the Dunavecit by a series of drains from both left and right banks
and this river joins the Devolli near Maliqe. Water quality monitoring was
conducted in 2003 to ascertain the salinity of the water supplies and the resultant
river salinity downstream of various drains. The sampling points are shown in
Figure 8.2 and the results for salinity are given in Table 8.1.
62



Table 8.1: Korce Gjanc KOU-1 River and Drain Water Salinity
Sample    Location                                 Salinity (dS/m)
Spring   Summer   Autumn
1         Reservoir water (main supply canal)  0.29   0.30      0.45
2         River water near penstock          0.51     0.49      0.80
3         River (and drain) water at Turani  0.45     0.52      1.04
4         River downstream Korce main drain  0.64     0.69      0.62
5         River downstream at Bulgarec       0.50     0.75      0.69
The water quality from river and reservoir is good. Catchment sedimentation into
the reservoir, mentioned by Hunting et al (1998b), is only a minor problem
because most of the water in the reservoir originates by diversion from the Osumi
river.
8.3.2              Irrigation Water
Irrigation water quality from the reservoir and headwaters is extremely good, with
very low EC (0.3-0.6 dS/m), TDS (270-500 mg/1) and SAR (0.2-0.6) values.
As with other areas, the sediment load in source waters and side streams are of
some concern as they increase the cost of maintenance. The local problem will be
addressed under a new programme that will involve the WUAs in soil conservation
measures (Natural Resources Management Project).
8.3.3               Drainage Water
The drains receive agricultural runoff and sewage from houses. Sewage discharge is
intermittent and difficult to quantify - it is more obvious in the drier months at low
drain flow. The river and drainage water was monitored for nitrogen and
phosphate. Phoshate content of river water varied between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/l even
when mixed with drain water, a low level (most river water averages about 0.1
mg/l). The exception was downstream of Turani villages (sample site 3) where the
concentration increased to 0.6 mg/I. Nitrate concentrations of the river ranged
from 0.5 to 1.4 mg/l, rising to 6.8 mg/l at Turani village. Also at the Turani site
the ammonium content was high at 5.1 mg/l. These elevated levels represent
localised contamination of the drain by sewage from Turani village. Concentrations
63



of all nutrients decreased to more normal levels 2 kms downstream at Bulgarec
(phosphate 0.24, ammonium 0.84, and nitrate 0.42 mg/l respectively).
8.3.4               Soils
Some concem was expressed about the presence of soils derived from ultrabasic
rocks, these soils have a higher exchangeable magnesium than exchangeable
calcium content. This subject was discussed in the Phase 2 screening study reports
on environmental aspects (Halcrow 2001c). There is little evidence to conclude
that these soils are a problem. Most of them have a high clay content and are
difficult to work, as are most clay soils. In any case they are not the dominant soils
within the scheme. Similar soils are cultivated elsewhere - Egypt has large areas
under cultivation without too many problems.
8.3.5               Summary
The 2003 monitoring results confirm previous findings (Hunting 1998b) that
irrigation water quality is good and that the drain water discharged back into the
river has very little effect upon overall river quality. Nitrate and phosphate values
are generally low, rising somewhat in the vicinity of villages (such as Turani) then
returning to more normal low values further downstream.
Drain water salinity remains low throughout the dry season, a time when one
might expect higher values.
Drain water has no measurable effect upon river water quality and the small
quantities of pollutants therein will be quickly diluted downstream. There are no
measurable environmental impacts.
8.4                 Without Project Future
Famling will continue as present with farmers supplementing water supply in late
summer by pumping from drains or river, wherever water is available for use. Late
summer crops are mainly vegetables for the Korce market and there are health
implications if watered by sewage contaminated drain water. The risks are greater
in the summer months as rainfall is low and inadequate to dilute drain water. The
application of agrochemicals will be limited.
64



8.5                 Environmental Impact of the Proposed Rehabilitation Works
8.5.1               Construction Impacts
The remaining works entail the reconstruction of small scale secondary channels.
The associated construction impacts are expected to be similarly localised and
short term.
The construction impacts revolve around dust, noise, disturbance to farmers and
local residents and removal of solid waste. The quantities of materials involved are
small, and most are imported on a daily basis and used that day. Equipment will be
small scale and mobile, being removed from site each day.
Dust and noise will be minimal, likewise obstruction of access roads. Labour will
be recruited locally from the scheme villages so there will not be any conflict with
village life and customs.
Small amounts of solid waste will be generated and disposed according to the
wishes of the local community.
8.5.2               Operational Impacts
(a)    Upstream Impact
There are no upstream impacts.
(b)    Within Scheme Impact
Sewage discharge is intermittent and difficult to quantify: it is more obvious in the
drier months at low drain flow. Rehabilitation and provision of irrigation water in
summer will result in a greater drain flow, dilution and flushing. A regular water
supply will also offset the practice of using drain water (or groundwater) for
irrigation.
An increased cropping intensity will result in the application of more
agrochemicals with increased amounts going to drains and/or the groundwater
table.
(c)    Downstream Impact
Drain water is discharged back to the river along the length of the sub-project.
Present discharges have little impact upon water quality. Future water quality is
expected to be similar, possibly with more nitrate and phosphate, but not unduly
so. There is no measurable impact.
65



8.6                Mitigation Measures
Regular inspection and clearance of debris from canals and drains and culverts will
be undertaken.
Application of improved farming practices will be encouraged through training
programmes on:
*   Deep ploughing to break up the plough pan to improve water infiltration
and crop aeration.
*   Farmer education concerning the storage, handling, application and
disposal of pesticide residues and containers
*   Farmer education concerning the problem of nitrates in water and
potential health effects.
*   Community agreement to limit nitrate applications to crops.
*   Storage and handling of farm yard manure
8. 7                The Monitoring Programme
The following section sets out a monitoring programme for public health and
environmental aspects. The programme is summarised in Table 8.2 and the
proposed locations are shown on Figure 8.2.
8.7.1              Public Health
(a)    Drainage canals
Six sites will be selected, according to the locations shown in Figure 8.2, the actual
site to be determined in relation to the villages - both upstream and downstream
sample sites are needed. Analysis will be undertaken for the determinands EC,
phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and faecal co]iforms. Samples will be
collected according to the requirements of the public health laboratory. Samples
will be taken in April and September of each year.
(b)    Well waters
Six wells will be chosen, according to the locations shown in Figure 8.2. The actual
sites will be determined by a field visit and discussion with the farmers. Analysis
will be undertaken for the determinands EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite,
ammonium, and faecal coliforms. Samples will be collected according to the
66



requirements of the public health laboratory. The samples will be taken at six
month intervals in April and September each year.
8.7.2               Scheme Water Tables
Water table observation pipes will be installed at 6 sites, according to the locations
shown in Figure 8.2. The location of the pipe must be with the consent of the
landowner who should be asked to take responsibility for its protection from
interference. The water table depth will be measured at three month intervals
during the months of September, December, March and June. Water samples will
be collected and analysed for EC only.

8.8                 Conclusions
Overall the environmental impact of this scheme would be positive and would
increase crop production and farm income. The rehabilitation would improve the
socio-economic status of the farmers and would be environmentally sustainable,
provided that the various mitigation measures are implemented. In addition the
improved availability of water in the summer months would flush the drains and
reduce the health hazard due to disposal of sewage. The scheme produces a
substantial quantity of vegetables for the nearby town of Korce and provision of
irrigation water would reduce the tendency to use polluted drain water for
irrigation. Negative impacts can be offset, or reduced, by engineering interventions
and/or improved farming practices. The scheme does not affect cultural values
and the increased incomes, improved diets, chances of employment for farm
labour, and an increase in the value of land would greatly increase the quality of life
of the local population.

9                   Lezhe LEU-1
9.1                Background
The LEU-1 scheme is situated between the mouths of the Drin and the Mat rivers
on the Adriatic coast in Lezhe District in North West Albania. It was constructed
in the 1 960s. The scheme was designed to irrigate a near level plain which was
reclaimed from coastal swamp, from a free intake on the adjacent river Mat as
shown on Figure 7.1.
Lack of canal maintenance in recent years has caused an almost total abandonment
of the scheme and the destruction of many structures. During 1999 rehabilitation
of the part of the drainage system was undertaken.
The scheme covers an area of 4,900 ha. Some 70% of this is currently cultivated
under rainfed conditions for the production of low value grain and fodder crops.
Only a small area of land is currently irrigated, due to the poor state of the main
canal and distribution system.

9.2                Description of the Rehabilitation Works
The following description of the rehabilitation works covers all the works that
were intended to be undertaken under the SIDRP.
Rehabilitation is aimed at improving the whole irrigation network in this area. Most
of the canals are to be lined and canal structures rehabilitated.
The following works are considered to be essential for the continued operation of
the scheme. Without these works, the scheme will become completely inoperable
very rapidly. They are too complex or expensive to be carried out under a regular
maintenance programme.
*      River training works in the Mat River, alongside the headreach.
*      Stabilisation of the headreach with retaining walls and partial lining.
*      Cover slabs in the lower part of the headreach to protect the canal from
falling rock debris.
*      Repair of joints in aqueducts and flumed reaches on the main canal.
The river training works, stabilisation of the headreach and the provision of cover
slabs over the canal have been carried out by NATO as part of infrastructure
works.
All other works proposed are less complex in nature including canal lining, de-
silting, and replacement of minor structures. Although as many of these as possible
should be constructed under the rehabilitation programme, some of this work
could be carried out under a rolling programme of maintenance to give a steady
improvement in the overall scheme as funds become available.
Major river training works are required alongside the main canal headreach.
Elsewhere on the scheme, excavation is limited to removing sediment and flood
debris from canals and structures such as siphons and culverts. Secondary canals
are extensively damaged and need significant work in remodelling.
Where existing concrete lining is damaged it will be repaired or replaced with a
mass concrete overlay. All lining in serviceable condition will be retained.
Structures are extensively damaged or have been demolished. It is planned to
repair all existing structures and build new ones where necessary. A total of 484
new steel gates are proposed.
73



Service roads are generally in very good condition. The new highway goes through
the scheme from north to south. No significant improvements are proposed. New
bridges are included where there is a demonstrable need. These are normally
simple concrete slabs spanning the canals.
The works on the main canal and secondary canals remain to be completed and
these are planned for consideration under the proposed Project.
9.3                 Present Environmental Situation
9.3.1               The Water Resource
The water supply is from the Mat river through a long intake channel that borders
the floodplain and then runs along the pediment of a limestone ridge. The
sedimentary rock strata slope steeply, and are poorly vegetated, a natural
consequence of an environment where weathered rock is rapidly moved
downslope by gravity. The resulting debris (scree) slopes are in a state of
metastable equilibrium. In one case the longitudinal profile of the scree slope is
now convex and slippage could occur at any time, especially during the rainy
season. A landslip here would effectively block the intake canal. This section has
recently been safeguarded by NATO who have reconstructed the section and the
irrigation water now passes through a pipe.
The flood embankment within the floodplain that protects the intake channel from
the high river flows, was formerly also in poor condition (in places), has also been
provided with protective spurs (groynes), again by NATO.
From the intake gates the main canal more or less follows the line of the Tirana-
Lezhe road, and is constructed on the narrow fringing pediments of a series of
limestone ridges. Rock outcrop is frequent, hillslopes are steep and the deeply
fissured limestone readily crumbles to form fan shaped, unstable mounds of
debris. The slopes above the canal are prone to landslips and rapid rainfall runoff
that continually threaten to dislocate irrigation water supplies. Small water slowing
check dams constructed in drainage ways are rapidly filled with debris. The lower
mountain slopes are planted with pine trees (Pinus spp) and little further soil
conservation can be achieved. Continuing maintenance of water slowing structures
and regular clearance of rubbish from culverts/cross regulators is essential. A
substantial allocation of maintenance costs is required to ensure a sustainable
project.
74



9.3.2               Imgation Water
The river source for LEU-1 is the Mat river and the Institute of Hydrometeorology
(IHM) maintain a river gauging and sampling point at Millot, across the river from
the intake works. The water quality is excellent for irrigation and there are no
problems whatsoever for use. Details of the river water chemistry published by
IHM are reproduced in Table 9.1.
Table 9.1:      Water Chemistry of the Mat at Millot
River    Ca   Mg     Na    K     HCO3     Cl   S04     EC     SAR    pH
Mat      0.9  0.3     1.9  0.1   2.8      0.2  0.2     0.3    2.4    8.0
Note: anions and cations expressed in milliequivalent per litre.
9.3.3               Drain Water
LEU-1 is only partly supplied with irrigation water at present due to the poor state
of the water distribution network. The main drains are still functioning and the
main pump station (Tale PS) is still operational. All drains contained water, even
at the end of the dry season, and a fair amount of sediment and vegetation. This
suggests that the drains are impeded and not working efficiently, especially as
irrigation water has not been provided. The field visit recorded that raw sewage
from houses was being discharged to drains. In addition some polluted drain water
was used for irrigation of vegetables.
The scheme drainage is partly by gravity to the coast and also through the Tale PS
where water is pumped directly into a creek within the tidal flats bordering the
Adriatic. The scheme water efficiency is extremely low and most irrigation water
passes into the drains without a great deal of change to its chemical composition.
The major change is a decrease in the calcium content as a consequence of the
precipitation of calcium carbonate as the water passes through the soil. This
reaction increases slightly the SAR of the water although the change is not
significant and has little effect upon the overall water quality. Domestic discharge
of sewage is well diluted by the time the effluent reaches the sea. The quantities of
pesticide and fertiliser will be small because the farmers are applying the minimum
doses necessary to maintain a satisfactory crop production.
Soil erosion in the watershed catchment areas results in a high sediment load in the
river at high flow periods when the irrigation system does not function. Clearly
sediment loads are lower during the summer months of reduced rainfall and water
75



velocity. The quantity of the sediment deposited in the irrigation and drainage
system is sufficient to demand regular annual clearance.
9.3.4               Soils and Agriculture
The scheme is situated at the seaward end of the rivers Drin and Mat and the soils
are developed from Quatemary deltaic and marine sediments.
Soil textures vary according to the physiographic position within the riverine
floodplain and the mixture with the marine sediments. Textures range from
gravelly sandy loams to silty clays. Soils are calcareous with a pH range from 7.4-
8.0. They are not saline. A plough pan exists in the medium to fine textured soils
and the soil, at a depth of 20 to 30 cm, is compacted and has a high bulk density
such that root penetration and water movement are impeded. The consequence is
that irrigation water and rainfall are not penetrating (or only penetrating slowly)
below the 30 cm depth and substantial runoff occurs, contributing to the surface
drainage problem.
The brazda system of irrigation is inefficient unless water application is carefully
supervised (the conservative estimate of irrigation efficiency is only 40%) and
particularly so where a plough pan is present. Most incident water (including rain)
flows to drains, carrying away any applied fertiliser, of which nitrogen fertilisers
would be most vulnerable.
Pesticide use is extremely low and also fertiliser inputs as most crops are grown on
rainfall (winter) and residual soil moisture, supplemented in part by subsurface
irrigation and sporadic summer rain.
9.3.5               Socio-Economic Conditions
The canals and drains are used for the disposal of solid and liquid domestic wastes
and the problems are most acute in the vicinity of scheme villages, as might be
expected. Domestic sewage disposal to drains presents a considerable health
hazard. It is clear that all households are not connected to cesspits, as reported in
the socio-economic surveys. The socio-economic studies reveal that only 15% of
households are connected to a piped water supply for domestic use. The other
households rely upon water abstracted from private or shared wells. The location
of wells and cess pits in the same vicinity near the commune village, gives rise to
some concern regarding possible pollution of the well water supply.
76



The deep groundwater is extracted for domestic supplies through a piped
distribution system. The groundwater aquifer in the sub-project is separated from
the overlying soils by a thick clay layer, said to be in excess of 30 metres thick, that
effectively seals off any penetration of potential contaminants.
The existing solid waste disposal situation is unsatisfactory since there is no
organised collection and disposal scheme for domestic rubbish. Household waste
litters road verges, fields, villages, drainage and irrigation canals. It is unsightly and
unsanitary as well as contributing to scheme water distribution and drainage
problems. The quality of life of the inhabitants of these villages is significantly
degraded.
9.4                  Without Project Future
The scheme will continue much as at present. Summer crop production will
continue to be limited to growth from stored soil moisture, some sub-irrigation
where the water table is shallow and the occasional summer rain shower. There
will be an increased tendency to water crops using any water source available,
especially sewage polluted drain water, with a consequent public health hazard.
Some farmers may be forced to dig shallow wells for irrigation, depleting a
freshwater source that serves as the domestic water supply for many families.
9.5                  Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Rehabilitation Works
9.5.1                Construction Phase
The rehabilitation of scheme infrastructure will, inevitably, give rise to some noise
and dust and temporary interruption to normal life. The engineering operations are
generally modest, apart from the main canals, and large excavations and/or
construction work is not envisaged. Imported machinery will be of a modest size
and most construction materials will be delivered to site on a daily basis. Local
people will be employed as workers. However, the reconstruction of lined
irrigation channels will result in production o f solid waste (principally solid blocks
of concrete). Contractors will agree a site with the WUAs (and the other villagers)
for the orderly and safe disposal of solid engineering waste. Otherwise
arrangements will be made to remove the material from the scheme with final
disposal at the landfill sites now being developed for the major municipalities.
Biodegradable material, sediment, soil and vegetation, will be deposited on site and
then smoothed on the banks of the canal in the traditional manner.
77



9.5.2                Operation Impacts
(a)     Upstream
There are no upstream impacts.
(b)     Within Scheme Impacts
The projected increase in agricultural production will be accompanied by an
increase in the application of fertilisers and pesticides. This increase is expected to
be moderate since the introduction of high pesticide use or high demand fertiliser
cropping is not foreseen. The irrigation efficiency will not be improved
significantly, so the salt burden of the drain water will remain about the same as
present. The concentration of fertiliser and pesticide residues in drain water will
increase slightly above the present very low levels.
Provision of an assured water supply will reduce the pressure to utilise drain water
for irrigation, although not entirely. Some vegetables will continue to be irrigated
using drain water to supplement the design determined schedules, with the same
concerns for public health due to contamination by raw sewage. Drains will carry
an increased volume of water and will dilute and flush sewage out of the system,
thereby reducing the health risk.
The pressure to utilise the groundwater resource for irrigation will be removed.
(c)     Downstream
Drain water is collected and discharged from the Tale PS to a creek that joins the
Drin river just before the river enters the Adratic. This water will be slightly
saline, will contain negligible amounts of fertilisers, and some well diluted
untreated domestic sewage. The daily inflow of sea water will further dilute any
effluent remaining on the tidal flats and any negative impacts to marine or littoral
ecosystems are considered to be negligible.
The southern area is drained by gravity to the sea.
The sub-project is situated on the southern boundary of the Kune-Vale Tale
managed nature re serve, a IUCN category 4 protected area, which contains
important biodiversity . Therefore, it is expected that some pollutants in the drain
water may reach the edge of the nature reserve. At present, no major impacts are
expected, but the Project will support monitoring of the impacts in the protected
site.
78



The drain water quality was monitored in 2003. The sampling sites are shown on
Figure 9.2 and the analytical data are reproduced in Table 9.2.
Table 9.2:      Lezhe LEU-1 Drain Water Salinity
Sample    Location                          Salinity (dS/m)
Spring  Summer    Autumn
1         Northem Pump Station              2.83    ns        2.8
2         Main Drain south                  12.2     ns       6.9
The drain water collected at the northem pump station is not unduly saline,
although somewhat more saline than other schemes. The southem drain is directly
connected to the sea and is influenced by the tide and hence the higher salt
content. Since the drain waters are discharged into the sea there are no
environmental problems associated with disposal.
9.6                Mitigation Measures
The proposed mitigation measures consist of regular clearance of debris from
culverts, irrigation and drainage channels and farmer training on the use of
agrochemicals.
Regular inspection and clearance of debris from canals and drains and culverts
Application of improved farming practices including:
*  Deep ploughing to break up the plough pan to improve water infiltration
and crop aeration.
*  Farmer education concerning the storage, handling, application and
disposal of pesticide residues and containers
*   Farmer education concerning the problem of nitrates in water and
potential health effects.
*   Community agreement to limit nitrate applications to crops.
*   Storage and handling of farm yard manure

9.7                 The Monitoring Programne
9.7.1               Public Health
The following sections describes the proposed monitoring programme which is
summarised in Table 9.3. The locations of monitoring sites are shown in Figure 9.2
(a)    Drainage canals
Six sites will be selected, according to the locations shown in Figure 9.2. The actual
sites will be determined in relation to the villages along the drains - both upstream
and downstream sample sites are needed. The analyses required are EC,
phosphate, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium, and faecal coliforms. Samples will be
collected according to the requirements of the public health laboratory. Samples
will be taken in April and September of each year.
(b)    Well waters
Six wells will be located as shown in Figure 9.2. The actual sites must be
determined by a field visit and discussion with the farmers to select four wells that
are shared by several families and two that are individually owned. Analyse will be
for the determinands, EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and faecal
coliforms. The sample collection will follow the requirements of the public health
laboratory. Samples will be taken at six month intervals in April and September
each year.
9.7.2               Scheme Water Tables
Water table observation pipes will be installed at six sites, according to the
locations shown in Figure 9.2. The location of the pipe must be with the consent
of the landowner who should be asked to take responsibility for its protection
from interference. Water table depth and salinity (EC) will be measured at three
month intervals during the months of September, December, March and June.
9.8                 Conclusions
Overall the environmental impact of this scheme would be positive and would
significantly increase crop production and farm income. The rehabilitation would
improve the socio-econonic status of the farmers and would be environmentally
sustainable, provided that the various mitigatory measures are implemented. In
addition the improved availability of water in the summer months would flush the
drains and reduce the health hazard due to disposal of sewage. The scheme
produces vegetables for the nearby town of Shkoder and the provision of irrigation
water would reduce the tendency to use polluted drain water for irrigation.
Negative impacts can be offset, or reduced, by engineering interventions, regular
80



attention to inspection and maintenance of infrastructure and/or improved
farming practices. The scheme does not affect cultural values and the increased
incomes, improved diets, chances of employment for farm labour, and an increase
in the value of land would greatly increase the quality of life of the local
population.

10                  Shkoder SHU-4
10.1                Background
The SHU-4 scheme area is located in Shkoder District in northern costal Albania.
It was originally constructed for the irrigation of wetland rice. Irrigation water is
provided by a free offtake on the Drini River downstream of the Vau I Dejes
power station.
The scheme covers an area of 5,300 ha of which some 60% is currently cultivated
for the production of low value grain and fodder crops. Approximately 25% of the
area is currently able to receive irrigation. The remaining area is cultivated under
rainfed conditions. A significant portion of the area, 1,200 ha, where there is
uncertain land ownership has developed into permanent natural pasture, which is
grazed all year.
As shown in Figure 10.1, the water for the SHU-4 system is taken from the
distributor structure P121 of the Mjedes main canal which bifurcate s to form the
left branch P121-Kukel with a capacity of 4.6 m3/sec, and the right branch P121-
Beltoje-Berdice-Daj,, U3, with a capacity of 12.6 m3/sec. Canal U3 supplies all the
other main canals and the other secondary canals of the SHU-4 irrigation system.
All the drain water from the drainage sub-projects is collected at one location,
passed into the Myrtemza main drain to be drained westwards under gravity, out of
the project area, into lake Myrtemza. A drainage canal conducts lake water through
the Veluni lagoon and then to the Adriatic. Lake Myrtemza also receives drain
water from several other irrigation schemes situated around Lake Myrtemza.
Lack of canal maintenance in recent years has resulted in damage to the canals and
the destruction of many structures limiting the area able to receive irrigation water.
The project would rehabilitate the main canal, main drains and secondary works.
Canal and drain structures will be (some already have been) rehabilitated and canal
lining rehabilitated.
83



Water Resources
Water for this sub-project is abstracted from the Drin upstream of the confluence
with the Buene. Drainage from this subproject is discharged into a shallow lake,
Lake Myrtemza, then through the Veluni lagoon to the Adriatic.
The Drin river has a catchment area of 14,173 square kilometres, of which 5973 lie
within Albania. The Drin has two tributaries - the Black Drin and the White Drin.
The Black Drin originates in FYR Macedonia and flows into Albania. The White
Drin originates in the Serbia and Montenegro, flows into Albania and joins the
Black Drin within Albanian territory. Near the town of Shkodra the Drin
combines with the Buene river, which flows from Shkodra Lake (an international
lake shared between Albania and the Serbia and Montenegro) to the Adriatic sea.
There is no ratified agreement regarding the use of international waterways
between Albania and FYR Macedonia, or between Albania and the Serbia and
Montenegro. However the Government of Albania informed both countries on 17
August 1998 concerning its intention to rehabilitate irrigation schemes with an
IDA credit and provided detailed information and a map on 7 November 1998.
The Government of Albania has not received any response from either country.

10.2                Descnption of the Rehabilitation Works
The rehabilitation works described below were intended to be undertaken under
the SIDRP. Part of these works were undertaken under that Project and the
remaining works, which are proposed to be undertaken under the proposed
Project.
Rehabilitation is aimed at improving the whole irrigation network in this area. The
improvement includes cleaning canals, repairing existing structures and building
new ones where necessary. Some of the canals will be lined.
10.2.1              Earthworks
Earthworks consist mainly of de-silting and re-sectioning canals and drains.
Elsewhere on the scheme, excavation is limited to removing sediment and flood
debris from structures such as siphons and culverts. Secondary canals are
extensively damaged and need significant work in remodelling.
10.2.2              Canal Lining
Mass concrete lining is proposed for some main and secondary canals, and all
canals that pass through village or urban areas. Standard design is M150 concrete,
thickness 8-10 cm, with 1:1 side slopes.
10.2.3              Structures
Structures are extensively damaged or have been demolished. It is planned to
repair all existing structures and build new ones where necessary. The majority of
structures are gated outlets in secondary canals, and culverts across drains.
10.2.4              Service Roads
The main access routes are generally in good condition. Most field roads within the
project area are adequate and no significant improvements are proposed, other
than repair or reconstruction of bridges and culverts.
10.2.5              Work to be Completed
All the drainage works have been completed and about half of the main canals
rehabilitated. The works to be undertaken under proposed Project comprise the
completion of the rehabilitation of the main canal works and rehabilitation of all
the secondary canals.
10.3                Present Environmental Situation
The sub-project involves one irrigation rehabilitation scheme SHU- 4.
87



A part of SHU-4 was studied during the first phase of SIDRP (HTS, Shkoder-
Zadrime 1998) and comprised 3200 ha situated adjacent to the Drin river and to
the east of the Lezhe-Shkoder road. The balance of the irrigated land within SHU-
4 (5300 ha) is the subject of the present sub-project study and is located to the
west of the Lezhe-Shkoder road.
10.3.1             Irrigation Wlater
This sub-project is supplied from the Drin river intake into canal U-1. Some
analyses of water from drains and canal and river are presented in the HTS report
and can be used to give a picture of the situation for the Shkoder SHU-4 sub-
project. The analytical data presented only concerns the quality of water for
irrigation. Some analyses are reproduced in Table 10.1 below:
Table 10.1:     Water Quality of River Drin, Canal and Drain for Shkoder
SHU-4
Location     Ca   Mg    Na    K     HCO3    Cl    S04    EC    SAR    pH
Drin         1.9   1.8  0.7   0.1   2.8     1.1   0.6    0.5   0.5    8.4
Canal        2.3   1.5  0.2   0.1   2.9     0.4   0.5    0.3   0.1    8.4
Drain        4.2   5.7  0.9   0.1   6.3     0.6   1.2    0.8   0.4    8.5
Note: anions and cations expressed in milliequivalent per litre.
Drini river water is of excellent quality for irrigation and does not pose any
problems whatsoever, as far as the chemical quality is concerned. The
calcium/magnesium ratio is rather narrow (1.0) and will decrease after irrigation
following precipitation of calcium (as calcium carbonate) from the irrigation water.
This prediction is supported by the analytical data for SHU-4 drain water where
the ratio of Ca/Mg is less than one.
10.3.2              Results of the 2003 Monitoring Programmer
All drainage from this scheme goes to the Myrtemza main drain and out of the
sub-project area. It therefore provides a useful location to monitor all potential
water borne pollutants leaving the area. The sampling point monitored in 2003 is
shown on Figure 10.2 and the salinity data collected are summarised in Table 10.2.
Nitrate and phosphate contents were low at 0.2 mg/l and 0.05 mg/l respectively.
88

10.3.3              Drain Water
All the drain water from the drainage sub-project will be collected into the large
spinal drain to be drained westwards under gravity, out of the project area, through
the Veluni lagoon and then by a channel to the Adriatic. Since irrigation efficiency
will be low the drain water quality will not be greatly changed from that of the
irrigation water, apart from a slight decrease in the calcium content, some nitrogen
and phosphate from fertilisers, a small quantity of pesticides and well diluted
sewage effluent.
10.3.4              Soils and Agriculture
The soils are derived from both riverain deposits and piedmont alluvial outwash
deposits. The alluvium deposited from the Drini river reflects the characteristic
textures associated with sedimentary deposition from overtopping of the river
banks. The soils nearest the river are coarse textured, mainly loamy sand and sandy
loam. Across the cover floodplain the textures are silt loam to silty clay loam and
silty clay at the boundary with the piedmont deposits. Soils are mainly greyish
brown and exhibit gley features in the poorly drained low lying portions of the
floodplain. The piedmont alluvium is somewhat redder in colour and of a
dominantly clay loam texture, becoming somewhat more sandy and gravelly as the
higher ground is approached. The soils are calcareous with a range of pH from 7.8
to 8.2. The water table during a visit in September 2000 was between 2 to 3 metres
deep and alfalfa and maize were grown under rainfall, with some ryegrass. A lot of
the area was under pasture in the south-west corner, where the water-table was
higher and adjacent drains full and stagnant.
10.3.5              Socio-Economic Conditions
Household waste litters in road verges, fields, villages, drains and irrigation canals.
The litter is unsightly and unsanitary as well as contributing to problems in water
distribution and drainage. Domestic sewage disposal to drains presents a local
health hazard. The quality of life of the inhabitants of the villages is significantly
degraded.
89



The socio-economic surveys recorded that no households were connected to main
drainage, all had latrines connected to cess pits. Some 30% of households reported
having access to stand pipes for domestic water use. The other households rely
upon groundwater abstracted locally from private wells. The location of wells and
cess pits in the same vicinity near a village, gives rise to some concern regarding
possible pollution of the well water supply.
10.4                Without Project Future
The irrigation canal system from the Drin is not likely to be breached by external
events but is sensitive to blockage by waste material. The present situation of
pasture production in the areas of high winter and summer water table, winter crop
losses due to water logging, subdued summer crop production without irrigation
and better crop yields in the areas with irrigation water should continue. The health
risk from irrigation of summer vegetable crops with drain water will remain.
10.5                Environmental Impact of the Proposed Rehabilitation Works
10.5.1              Construction Impacts
The construction works that remain to be finished are completion of the main
canal network and all the secondary canals. The canals are not large and the
associated construction impacts are expected to be localised and short term.
The construction impacts revolve around dust, noise, disturbance to farmers and
local residents and removal of solid waste. The quantities of materials involved are
small, and most are imported on a daily basis and used that day. Equipment will be
small scale and mobile, being removed from site each day. The types of impacts
might include some disruption to nearby residents from noise or dust,
contamination of channels from runoff of aggregate stockpiles or accidental
spillages of fuel or lubricants.
Dust and noise will be minimal, likewise obstruction of access roads. Labour will
be recruited locally from the scheme villages so there will not be any conflict with
village life and customs.
All solid waste will be removed and disposed according to the wishes of the local
community.
90



10.5.2              Operational Impacts
(a)    Upstream
Upstream impact is negligible. The river Drin passes through a series of reservoirs
from the border with Kosovo to a final dam located south-east of Shkoder town.
A considerable amount of the sediment load is deposited within the storage system
and the irrigation water is relatively clear.
(b)    Within Scheme Impacts
The improvement in drainage will eventually bring about a change from a pasture-
based system to more winter wheat production and irrigation in summer will
increase the area of land under crops. There will be a modest increase in the
applications of fertilisers and pesticides with a corresponding moderate increase of
nutrients and pesticide residues in the drain water. Irrigation efficiency will not be
improved so the salt burden of the drain water will remain similar to the present
levels.
Plough pans develop in the medium to fine textured soils and this pan requires
ripping at regular (generally five year intervals).
Domestic water is obtained mainly (70%) from private wells, with possible
contamination by nitrogen from fertiliser and manure and domestic sewage from
cess pits.
Domestic sewage is discharged to drains. Drain water is occasionally used in
summer months for irrigation of summer vegetables between irrigation intervals.
This activity is a potential health hazard but the risk will be reduced as drain water
will be in greater supply, diluting and flushing sewage through the system.
(c)    Downstream
Drainage from the scheme is collected at the Myrtemza main drain, which then
flows by gravity between two limestone ridges into Lake Myrtemza. A drainage
canal conducts lake water through the Veluni lagoon and then to the Adriatic.
Since irrigation efficiency will be low the drain water quality will not be changed
significantly from that of the irrigation water, apart from a slight decrease in the
calcium content, some nitrogen and phosphate from fertilisers, a small quantity of
pesticides and well diluted sewage effluent. Lake Myrtemza also receives drain
water from the other irrigation schemes around Veliposa. The Veluni lagoon is
rated a category 4 protected area (a managed nature reserve). Drain water reaching
the lagoon will be a mix of SHU-4 and other scheme drains. Drain water quality
91



monitoring will be restricted to SHU-4 water although to monitor total inputs to
the Veluni lagoon then other scheme drain waters should also be assessed. In
practice, it is reasonable to assume that Veliposa drain water will be similar to
SHU-4 water as most irrigation projects in the vicinity have similar cropping
patterns.
10.6                Mitigation Measures
Engineering works for the primary canal system involves substantial rehabilitation
leading to moderate negative impact of disturbance, noise and dust. The
engineering works for the secondary canal system requires mainly minor and short-
lived impacts causing disturbance, noise and dust. Even so the work force will not
be large, perhaps 20 to 30 persons, most of whom will be recruited from the
scheme viUages or nearby Shkoder town. There will not be any cultural clashes.
Supply of most items will be sub-let to small contractors who will deliver
aggregates, steel rods, and other building requirements on a daily basis. There is no
need for a large storage area. Reconstruction of the main canals and secondary
irngation channels will result in the production of solid waste (principally solid
blocks of concrete). A fair amount of solid waste will be generated (mainly
concrete and steel gates) which will require disposal in the local land fill site.
Other mitigation measures will involve regular inspection and clearance of debris
from canals and drains. The agrochemical mitigation will be handled through the
implementation of improved farming practices. These will include:
* Deep ploughing to break up the plough pan to improve water infiltration
and crop aeration.
* Farmer education concerning the storage, handling, application and
disposal of pesticide residues and containers
* Farmer education concerning the problem of nitrates in water and
potential health effects.
* Community agreement to limit nitrate applications to crops.
* Storage and handling of farm yard manure

10.7                The Monitoring Programme
The irrigation water supply quality (the Drin river) is monitored (and has been for
many years) by the Institute of Hydrometeorology - there is no need to duplicate
such work. The PMU will obtain and analyse data from the Hydrometeorology
Institute. The following sections describes the monitoring programme, which is
summarised in Table 8.3. The location of the water table monitoring sites and the
sampling sites for drain water collection are shown in Figure 10.2.
10.7.1             Public Health
(a)    Drainage canals
Six sites will be chosen, according to the locations shown in Figure 8.2, the actual
site to be determined in relation to the villages along the drains. Samples from
upstream and downstream of each village are needed. The analysis will be for the
determinants EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and faecal coliform. The
samples will be collected according to the requirements of the public health
laboratory. The Samples will be taken in April and September each year.
(b)    Well waters
Four wells will be monitored according to the locations shown in Figure 10.2. The
actual sites must be determnined by a field visit and discussion with the farmers to
select two wells that are shared by several families and two that are individually
owned. The analysis will comprise EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and
faecal coliform. The sample collection must follow the requirements of the public
health laboratory. Samples are to be taken in April and September each year.
10.7.2             Scheme Water Tables
Water table observation pipes will be installed at 6 sites according to the locations
shown in Figure 10.2. The water table depth will be measured at three month
intervals during the months of September, December, March and June. Water
samples will be collected and analysed for EC only.
10.7.3              Collector Drain Monitoring
The main collector on SHU-4 will be monitored for flow and quality. Drain water
will be sampled before it enters Lake Myrtemza. Analyses will be undertaken for
EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, sediment load and pesticides at six
monthly intervals. Samples will be collected in April and September. A gauging
station will be constructed at the end of the Myrtemza main drain to record drain
flow. Measurements will be made four times a year in September, December, April
and June.

10.8               Conclusions
Overall the environmental impact of this scheme would be positive and would
significantly increase crop production and farm income. Farming will probably
continue with a significant proportion of animal husbandry but the supply of
irrigation water will provide an increased amount of fodder, both lucerne and
maize stover. The availability of increased amounts of fodder will remove the
necessity to graze flocks on adjoining hill land, thus reducing the onset of soil
erosion. The rehabilitation would improve the socio-economic status of the
farmers and would be environmentally sustainable. The improved availability of
water in the summer months would flush the drains and reduce the health hazard
due to disposal of sewage. The scheme produces some vegetables for the nearby
town of Shkoder and the provision of irrigation water would reduce the tendency
to use polluted drain water for irrigation. Negative impacts can be offset, or
reduced, by regular attention to inspection and maintenance of infrastructure
and/or improved farming practices. The scheme does not affect cultural values
and the increased incomes, improved diets, chances of employment for farm
labour, and an increase in the value of land would greatly increase the quality of life
of the local population.

Vlore VLU-1
Background
The rehabilitation works of irrigation scheme VLU-1 and drainage schemes VLK-1
and VLK-2 are located in the Myzeqe massif of the Vlore District in southem
coastal Albania. The drainage schemes cover the entire area, whilst the irrigation
scheme presently covers only 3000ha of the area, omitting the former state land
reclamation scheme that consists of low lying saline land.
As shown on Figure 11.1, the VLU-1 irrigation scheme is a gravity system taking
water from Vjosa river through the Mifoli pump station which supplies the Ul
primary canal, the UU2-U9 secondary irrigation canals and the sub-secondary and
tertiary canals system. Most of the area is drained to the Adriatic sea through the
Akernia pump station.
The scheme serves the agricultural communities of Mifol, Novosele, Cerkovine,
Aliban, Akernia, Bishan, Poro and Delisuf villages.
The northern area of 3,000 ha has been allocated to farmers. Of this area 50 to
60% is currently cultivated for the production of low value grain and fodder crops
with only 300 ha receiving irrigation. Areas unable to receive irrigation are
cultivated under rainfed conditions.
Lack of canal maintenance in recent years has caused the deterioration of the
canals and structures severely limiting the area able to receive water. The intake
channel to the Mifoli pump station suffers from severe siltation annually and there
are problems of river control where riverbank erosion threatens the irrigated area
in several places.
The project would rehabilitate the main canal, main drains, provide protection
works to vulnerable areas to prevent damage from the river Vjosa and rehabilitate
the irrigation and drainage pump stations for the cultivated area of 3,000 ha where
land has been allocated to farmers. Canal and drain structures and canal lining will
be rehabilitated.

The Vjosa river is the main water source. After rehabilitation of the scheme, the
volume of water abstracted will not be greater than that formerly taken.
11.2               Desctiption of the Rehabilitation Works
The following description of the rehabilitation works covers the works that were
intended to be undertaken under the SIDRP. Only some of these works were
carried out under that Project and the remaining works are proposed to be
undertaken under the proposed Project.
Rehabilitation is based on the original plan and is aimed at improving the irrigation
and drainage network to the currently cropped area of 3000 ha. This improvement
includes cleaning and desilting all canals and drains, repairing existing structures
and building new ones where necessary.
Some works are considered essential for the continued operation of the scheme.
These essential works are not complex but without them the system will remain
inoperable. These are:
*      Reconstruction of Mifoli Pump Station and replacement of pumps with
submersibles.
*      Replacement of pumps at Akernia Pump Station.
*      Restoration of power lines to Akernia Pump Station.
The Skrofolina saline area was considered too expensive to reclaim and was
excluded from the irrigation programme, apart from the drainage works necessary
to conduct water away for eventual discharge to the sea.
All other works proposed are less complex in nature including canal lining, de-
silting, re-sectioning, and replacement of minor structures. Although as many of
these as possible should be constructed under the rehabilitation programme, some
of this work could be carried out under a rolling programme of maintenance to
give a steady improvement in the overall scheme as funds become available.
100



(a)    Akerrnia Pump Station
The rehabilitation works comprise:
*      Replacing the 3 destroyed pumps with 3 new pumps (Q = 2.5 m3/s, H
6 m,N = 200 kw
*      Replacing the delivery pipes
*      Replacing the electric control plant
*      Construction of a new electric line tension 10 kv, 12 km long from Mlifoli
sub-station.
*      Structural improvements induding the damp-course of the old station,
partial replacement of the doors and windows, repairing plastering and
painting.
*      Repairing and construction of pump intake structure.
(b)    Mifoli Pump Station
A complete re-design is recommended, in order to avoid the perennial problems of
siltation of the existing intake channel. This is based on the use of electric
submersible pumps mounted on sloping rails inclined at an angle of 30 degrees to
the horizontal. Civil works are minimal, pumps can be raised clear of the water
during floods or for maintenance, and the pumps themselves require no priming
and little maintenance.
(c)    Canals
The main and the secondary canals are in many places filed with sediment and
have damaged sections, damaged lining and destroyed structures. Seepage is
significant in hilly areas where soils tend to be permeable. The project proposes to
rehabilitate the canals and structures to their original condition, with concrete
lining in some main and secondary canals, which are situated in sandy or other
permeable soils.
(d)    Earthworks
Earthworks consist mainly of de-silting and re-sectioning canals and drains.
Elsewhere on the scheme, excavation is limited to removing sediment and flood
debris from structures such as siphons and culverts. Secondary canals are
extensively damaged and need significant work in remodelling.
101



(e)    Canal Lining
Mass concrete lining is proposed for some main and secondary canals, and all
canals that pass through vilage or urban areas. Standard design is M150 concrete,
thickness 10-15 cm, with 1:1 side slopes.
(f)    Structures
Structures are extensively damaged or have been demolished. It is planned to
repair all existing structures and build new ones where necessary. The majority of
structures are gated outlets in secondary canals, and culverts across drains.
(g)    Service Roads
The main access routes are generally in very good condition. Most gravel roads
within the project area are adequate and no significant improvements are
proposed, other than repair or reconstruction of bridges and culverts.
(h)    River Training Works
In total five new groynes 30m long are proposed in the two reaches of the Vjosa
River that are prone to severe bank erosion. It has been suggested that they should
be placed across the current at an angle of 60 degrees, but this is not in accordance
with internationally accepted practice and is unlikely to be effective. A better
alternative will be to orient the groynes perpendicular to the bank, and at a spacing
of 3 times the length of individual groynes. Construction would utilise precast
concrete blocks 1 m cube.
The works on the pump station, river training works, main and secondary canals
remain to be completed and these are planned for the Water Resource
Management Project.
11.3                Present Environmental Situation
11.3.1              Setting
The subproject is situated on the right bank of the river Vjosa close to the outfall
to the sea. The scheme consists of irrigation rehabilitation of 3,040 ha of both
irrigated and drained land, and drainage of 1,170 ha of saline land. Two distinct
physiographic features are included: a higher lying alluvial plain derived mainly
from sediments of the river Vjosa with some piedmont alluvial material (the
scheme lands) and a lower lying lacustrine plain of mixed riverain and marine
sediments (saline land excluded from the irrigation scheme). Coastal dunes isolate
the scheme from the Adriatic on the west. A substantial part of the coastal dune
land has been planted to pines and this land, comprising 1,770 ha, is a IUCN
102



Category 4 protected area. The southern boundary of the scheme is formed by salt
works that separate the sub-project from the Narta lagoon (an area being prepared
for Ramsar site status).
11.3.2              The Water Resource
Water is abstracted from the Vjosa river by a pump station situated near to the
village of Mifoli. The main irrigation canal is the U-1 canal that runs parallel to the
Vjosa river and supplies water to most of the alluvial plain soils. A subsidiary canal
(the Ull) contours along the side of the higher land to the south of Mifoli and
provides irrigation water to the soils of the piedmont alluvium.
The U-1 irrigation channel, in places, runs very close to the meandering river
channel of the Vjosa and minor changes in channel direction threaten the integrity
of the canal. Two sites, in particular, appear at risk and embankment protection (in
the form of groynes) is proposed to rectify the potential problem.
The subsidiary canal (U-I l) is a higher level contour canal that is constructed on
the fringing pediments from the hills that form the south east boundary of the sub-
project. The slopes above the canal are only partially stable and rapid rainfall run-
off carries substantial debris into the cross drainage structures. Continuing
maintenance and regular clearing of culverts and check dams will be essential. A
substantial allocation of maintenance costs is required to ensure a sustainable
project.
11.3.3              Irmigation Water
Some analytical data for the Vjosa at Mifol is provided by BCEOM (1996). The
water quality is excellent for irrigation. Details of the water chemistry published by
BCEOM have been converted to units suitable for irrigation water quality
assessment (conversion of results in milligrams per litre to milliequivalents per litre
or millimols per charge). Results are reproduced in Table 11.1.
Table 11.1:      Water Chemistry of the Vjosa at Mifol
River        Ca    Mg    Na    K     HCO3     Cl    S04    EC    SAR    pH

Note: anions and cations expressed in milliequivalent per litre.
11.3.4              Drain Water
Only a limited amount of land is presently irrigated, said to be around 10% or 300
ha, and the proposed irrigation rehabilitation is restricted to the 3,000 ha of the
103



higher lying alluvial plain soils. This land is drained by gravity. Drain KK-1 will
remove surplus water from around 1,100 ha of irrigated land and another 860 ha
of adjoining upland, by-passing the salt works, with eventual discharge into the
Narta lagoon. The lagoon receives about 30% of the total drain water and also the
rainfall runoff from the adjoining upland. The total quantity of water involved over
the year is around 4.2 X106 m3.
Drain water and upland runoff water contribute equal amounts to the total drain
flow.
The remaining land, apart from 300 ha, is drained into the former cultivated
lagoon lands for eventual disposal to the sea through the Akernia pump station.
The Akernia pump station does not work at the present and so the former lagoon
area is poorly drained, even in the summer months, and partly flooded in the rainy
season.
The final 300 ha in the vicinity of the village of Porcja will be drained into an old
channel of the Vjosa, suitably deepened for gravity outfall into the sea.
11.3.5              Soils andAgnculture
The scheme is situated at the seaward end of the Vjosa river and the soils are
developed from a complex mix of parent material, river alluvium, piedmont
alluvium, deltaic and marine sediments. The piedmont alluvial soils are loams to
clay loams.
The soils of the alluvial plain exhibit a range of textures that reflect the age and
depositional sequence of sediment from river water moving across the floodplain.
The most recent sediments are of a coarse texture of sands to sandy loams and are
deposited nearest to the river channel. Behind the levees the sediments are finer
textured (silt loams to silty clay loams) on the cover flood plain with the finest
textures (silty clay to clay) in the backswamp areas where water previously ponded
against the hill slopes. The soils become much sandier to the west near to the
coast.
The alluvial and piedmont alluvial soils are mainly calcareous with a pH in the
range 7.5-8.0. Salinity is not a problem except to the west, near the villages of
Porcja and Delisuf where the soils are sandy, the groundwater is saline, close to the
surface and there is sufficient capillary rise to salinise the topsoils. Drainage and
irrigation will reclaim these areas. The irrigation pump station at Mifoli works
104



sporadically when money is available to pay for electricity. During the last summer
season only about 25% of the crop was irrigated and five applications were given.
A plough pan exists in most of the medium to fine textured soils and the soil, at a
depth of 20 to 30 cm, is compacted and has a high bulk density such that root
penetration and water movement are impeded. The consequence is that irrigation
water and rainfall are not penetrating (or only penetrating slowly) below the 30 cm
depth and substantial run off occurs under intense rainfall, contributing to the
surface drainage problem.
The brazda system of irrigation is inefficient unless water application is carefully
supervised (the conservative estimate of irrigation efficiency is only 40%/6) and
particularly so where a plough pan is present. Most incident water (induding rain)
flows to drains, carrying away any applied fertiliser, of which nitrogen fertilisers
would be most vulnerable.
Pesticide use is extremely low and also fertiliser inputs, as most crops presently, are
grown on rainfall (winter) and residual soil moisture, supplemented in part by
subsurface irrigation, the occasional surface irrigation when water is available, and
sporadic summer rain. Fertiliser and manure applications, at best, may just balance
nutrient removal by the crop.
11.3.6              The Narta Lagoon
The total surface area of Narta lagoon is around 4,000 ha, including the salt pans
that occupy around 1200 ha. The area covered by water varies with the season.
There is only one outlet channel to the Adriatic sea with a flow rate of 1-5 m3/s.
Two islands exist in the south west of the lagoon of which the larger is covered by
Cypress trees and contains a small monastery. The lack of significant water
exchange with the Adtiatic and intense summer evaporation brings about a
reduction, in summer, of water surface of 30%. The dry area appears to be
increasing annually. Water depth in summer is about 10-20 cm and increases in
winter to around 40 cm.
11.3.7              Soeio-Economic Conditions
Domestic sewage disposal to drains presents a health hazard, although 90% of the
households dispose of sewage to cess pits. The existing waste disposal situation
within the sub-project is unsatisfactory since there is no organised collection and
disposal scheme for domestic rubbish.
105



The socio-economic studies reveal a good situation with regard to water supply for
domestic use as 80% of households are connected to a piped supply. The other
20% of households rely upon water abstracted from private wells. The location of
wells and cess pits in the same vicinity near the commune village, gives rise to
some concern regarding possible pollution of the well water supply.
11.4                Without Project Future
The scheme will continue much as at present and continuing downstream bank
erosion will eventually result in the loss of agricultural land and the breaching of
the principal irrigation canal (the U-1 canal). Loss of agricultural land and loss of
summer irrigation water will reduce scheme summer crop yields from an already
low base. Summer crop production will then be limited to growth from stored soil
moisture, some sub-irrigation where the water table is shallow and the occasional
summer rain shower. There will be pressure to water crops using any water source
available, including sewage polluted drain water, with a consequent public health
hazard.
Some farmers may be forced to dig shallow wells for irrigation, depleting a
freshwater source that serves as the domestic water supply for some of the
villagers.
11.5                Environmental Impact of the Proposed Rehabilitation Works
11.5.1              Construction Phase
Engineering works for the primary canal system involves substantial rehabilitation
leading to moderate negative impact of disturbance, noise and dust. The
engineering works for the secondary canal system requires mainly minor and short
lived impacts causing disturbance, noise and dust. The reconstruction of the Mifoli
Pump Station will be a fairly large project but takes place away from most
settlements. River bank protection structures also involve some larger than normal
construction work. The work force will not be large, perhaps 20 to 30 persons,
most of whom will be recruited from the scheme villages or nearby Vlore town
There will not be any cultural clashes. Supply of most items will be sublet to small
contractors who will deliver aggregates, steel rods, and other building requirements
on a daily basis. There is no need for a large storage area. A fair amount of solid
waste will be generated (mainly concrete and steel gates) which will require disposal
in the local land fill site.
11.5.2              Operation Phase
(a)    Upstream Impacts
106



No upstream impacts are expected. Withdrawal of water will be restricted to the
volume extracted when the systems were working.
(b)    Within Scheme Impacts
The KK-1 main drain crosses many drainage ways and also acts as a cutoff drain.
Each year there is substantial deposition of sediment and inspection and clearance
of drain and cross drain structures is essential.
The projected increase in agricultural production will be accompanied by an
increase in the application of fertilisers and pesticides. This increase is expected to
be moderate since the introduction of high pesticide use or high demand fertiliser
cropping is not foreseen due to the high cost of agrochemicals following removal
of state subsidies.
The irrigation efficiency will not be improved so the salt burden of the drain water
will remain about the same as present. The concentration of fertiliser and pesticide
residues in drain water will increase slightly above the present very low levels. The
effect of the volume of drain water that will be discharged into the Narta lagoon is
likely to be small, but a monitoring programme will be implemented to check this
assumption.
Provision of an assured water supply will reduce the pressure to utilise drain water
for irrigation. This situation will be monitored by drain sampling. The need to
utilise the groundwater resource for irrigation of the major summer crops will be
largely removed.
The increased volume of water moving through the drains in the dry summer
months will dilute and flush away any sewage.
Plough pans develop in the medium to fine textured soils and this pan requires
ripping at regular (generally five year) intervals.
Some 20% of households obtain potable water from private wells, with possible
contamination by nitrogen from fertiliser and manure and domestic sewage from
cess pits.
107



(c)    Downstream Impacts
Water that is discharged directly to the sea through the Akernia drainage pump
station will be saline since it passes through the Akernia salt flats and will inevitably
collect some saline return flow from these salty soils. The water will also contain
negligible amounts of fertiliser and pesticides, and some well diluted untreated
domestic sewage.
Drain water that reaches the sea through the old meander channel of the Vjosa
will be slightly saline, contain only small amounts of fertiliser and pesticide as well
as very small quantities of untreated sewage. The daily inflow of sea water will
further dilute any effluent remaining on the foreshore or the tidal flats and any
negative impacts to marine or littoral ecosystems are considered to be negligible.
The current flow along the coast is in a northerly direction and so any effluent will
be carried away from the entrance to the Narta lagoon, an area being prepared for
Ramsar site status.
The drain water from drain KK-1 will discharge directly into the Narta lagoon.
The expected discharge from this source is estimated to be around 4 million cubic
metres per year and will be a mixture of surplus rain water from the upland and
land drainage water. The quantities of fertiliser and pesticides will be small and
salinity of the water will be low. Problems due to eco-toxicity are not expected but
the drain water will be monitored on a regular basis to establish longer term trends
in water quality. Similarly, regular monitoring of ecological habitats will be
conducted.
11.6                Mitigation Measures
Mitigation measures have been adopted wherever possible in the engineering
design.
*      The river Vjosa is unstable and bank erosion a problem. This has been
rated as a moderate negative impact. Engineering works, consisting of
construction of groynes are proposed to provide protection of the main
supply canal.
*      One high level irrigation canal is situated at the base of hillslopes subject
to soil erosion. This is considered to be a minor problem. Cross drainage
structures and check dams will require continuous repair and cleaning.
*      The soils of the alluvial plain will be ripped periodically.
*      Drain water from about 1,100 ha of the alluvial plain will be discharged
into the Narta lagoon, a protected area. The impact is not expected to be
108



more than minor since improved agricultural operations are expected to
be modest.
*      Some drain water will be discharged into the Vjosa near its outfall to the
sea with negligible impact.
Drain water from the rest of the alluvial plain, and the saline drain water from the
reclamation lands of the lacustrine plain, will be discharged into the Adriatic sea.
The impact will be negligible.
Training on the application of improved farming practices will be undertaken,
including:
*   Deep ploughing to break up the plough pan to improve water infiltration
and crop aeration.
*   Farmer education concerning the storage, handling, application and
disposal of pesticide residues and containers
*   Farmer education concerning the problem of nitrates in water and
potential health effects.
*   Community agreement to limit nitrate applications to crops.
*   Storage and handling of farm yard manure
11.7                The Monitoring Programme
Monitoring for environmental purposes has been designed to check those aspects
identified as critical for public health (well water quality, drain water quality) and
those that will give information and possible early warning of trends that will affect
longer term sustainability (water table behaviour and salinity). Since one of the
drains empties into the Narta lagoon this location will be monitored for salinity,
phosphate, nitrates, and pesticides. An overview of the monitoring programme is
provided in Table 11.2. The proposed location of the water table monitoring sites
and the sampling sites for drain water collection are shown in Figure 11.2. The
water supply quality (the Vjosa river) has been monitored systematically over many
years by the Institute of Hydrometeorology - there is no need to duplicate such
work. The PMU will obtain data and analyse trends.
109



11.7.1              Public Health
(a)    Drainage canals
10 sites will be monitored, according to the locations shown in Figure 9.2, the
actual site to be determined in relation to the villages along the drains - both
upstream and downstream sample sites are needed. Water will be analysed for the
determinants EC, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and faecal coliform.
Samples will be collected according to the requirements of the public health
laboratory. Samples will be taken in April and September of each year.
(b)    Main Drain
The KK-I drain discharges to the environmentally sensitive Narta lagoon, which is
expected to be declared a Ramsar site. The principal interest from the ecological
side will be the concentrations of pesticides and fertilisers in the drain water.
KK-1 drain water will be sampled twice a year in April and September. Drain flow
volume will be recorded four times each year in September, December, April and
June. A measuring weir will be installed. Samples will be analysed for EC,
phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, EC, sediment load and pesticide residues.
(c)    Well waters
Six wells will be monitored, according to the locations shown in Figure 9.2. The
actual sites must be determined by a field visit and discussion with the farmers to
select wells. Samples will be analysed for the determinands EC, phosphate, nitrate,
nitrite, ammronium and faecal coliform. Samples will be collected according to the
requirements of the public health laboratory. Samples will be taken at six month
intervals in April and September each year.
11.7.2              Scheme Water Tabkes
Water table observation pipes will be installed at 10 sites, according to the
locations shown in Figure 9.2. The location of the pipe must be with the consent
of the landowner who should be asked to take responsibility for its protection
from interference. Water table depth will be measured at three month intervals
during the months of September, December, March andJune. Water samples are
to be collected and analysed for EC.

11. 8               Conclusions
Provision of irrigation water will significantly increase crop production and
improve the socio-economic status of the farmers. The projected increase in
agricultural production will be accompanied by an increase in the application of
fertilisers and pesticides. This increase is expected to be moderate since the



introduction of high pesticide use or high demand fertiliser cropping is not
foreseen.
The drains will be flushed more frequently and any sewage diluted and removed
from source, again reducing a public health risk.
The irrigation efficiency will not be improved so the salt burden of the drain water
will remain about the same as present. The concentration of fertiliser and pesticide
residues in drain water will increase above the present very low levels. Downstream
impact of the drain water upon the seashore will be negligible. The pollution load
of the drain water that will be discharged into the Narta lagoon is likely to be small.
The increase in agricultural activity to full production is predicted to take place
over a five year period that will give time to obtain a comprehensive series of
results from the monitoring programme.
Provision of an assured water supply will reduce the pressure to utilise drain water
for irrigation. The need to utilise the groundwater resource for irrigation of the
major summer crops will be removed.
Operation and maintenance schedules must be implemented for the success of the
rehabilitated scheme. The route of the main canal remains vulnerable to damage
from riverbank erosion by future changes in river morphology.
The culverts, the torrent flow courses, and the minor water control structures
along the subsidiary main canal must be kept free from debris to prevent flood
damage from upper slope run-off.
The scheme will be sustainable, both from a social and environment point of view,
provided that regular inspections and maintenance of infrastructure is carried out
and that the monitoring scheme results are carefully analysed and the cause(s) for
unexpected changes determined. The results from the KK-1 drain that discharges
to the Narta lagoon are particularly important.

12                 Environmental Management Plan First
Phase Schemes
12.1               Introduction
The principal objective of an EMP is to ensure that the proposed schemes are
implemented in such a way as to avoid negative construction and operational
impacts on the environment. To achieve this objective, seven tasks are identified:
1. Identification of the key environmental aspects and impacts
2. Development of mitigation measures to address negative impacts
3. Development of a monitoring programme to track impacts of the scheme on
the environment through the construction and operational phases
4. Establishment of sound environmental institutional arrangemrents
5. Implementation of the EMP
6. Promotion of environmental awareness among stakeholders
7. Detailed post-evaluation (environmental audit).
The following sections describe the main components of the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) which are summarised in the site specific EMPs. A
generic EMP is provided in Appendix A, which should be used as a guide for the
preparation of new EMPs for additional schemes.
12.2               Key EnvironmentalAspects
The six irrigation rehabilitation schemes are located in areas with a long-standing
tradition of irrigation dating back to the 1 960s. None of these irrigation areas are
known to be sensitive eco-systems, although two of the schemes drain to wetlands
of scientific interest. There are no sites of archaeological interest in the irrigation
areas, despite the abundance of many such important sites within Albania.
Numerous villages are sited within and around the irrigation sites, which lead to
environmental problems particularly due to the lack of adequate wastewater
facilities and solid waste disposal activities by inhabitants.
Tables 12.1 to 12.3 provide an overview of the magnitude, direction and duration
of impacts on the physical, biological and human environments associated with the
rehabilitation of the six irrigation schemes.
114



Construction impacts are expected to have minor, negative, temporary effects on
land disturbance, dust and noise. All the schemes are expected to have minor,
negative long term impacts on drain water quality, groundwater levels and
groundwater quality. Schemes SHU-4 and VLU-1 would have no significant or
only minor negative impacts on the water quality of downstream lagoons. All of
the schemes are predicted to have minor benefits on soil salinity and soil fertility.
Rehabilitation of S HU-4 and VLU-1 schemes may have minor, negative, long term
impacts on the aquatic flora and fauna of nature reserves, namely the Veluni
lagoon (a nature reserve) for SHU-4 and the Narta lagoon (a candidate RAMSAR
site) for VLU-1.
All six rehabilitation projects are expected to benefit people and communities, with
the exception of public health issues related to the quality of groundwater quality
used for drinking. There is potential for contamination by nitrates and bacteria, the
main sources being rural sanitation facilities (e.g. cess pits) rather than the use of
fertilisers on agricultural land. Moderate benefits are expected for health, land
values, crop cultivation and quality of life.

12.3                Mitigation Plan
It is inevitable that some of the sub-projects will have negative impacts and the
ultimate degree of severity will depend very much upon project mitigation
measures. The EIA identified the need for mitigation in the following areas (a)
engineering interventions, (b) control of construction-related nuisances, (c)
operational and maintenance activities, (d) farming interventions through TA
training programmes. The following text summarises the main mitigation measures
identified for the rehabilitation of the six irrigation areas. No mitigation measures
are proposed for the up and downstream areas, where scheme impacts are not
considered to be significant.
*      Engineening Interventions. Engineering interventions include: improved de sign
and replacement of intakes, provision of river bank protection structures,
remodelling of cross drainage, lining of primary and secondary irrigation
channels, new irrigation water control gates and improved drainage. These
118



structures have all been considered under SIRDP and incorporated (as
necessary) into the scheme engineering designs. The costs have been
incorporated into the scheme costs.
*      Control of construction-related nuisances. Construction-related impacts on
communities and the environment can be largely mitigated through good
housekeeping measures on site. This approach will involve the
incorporation of environmental clauses and the SEMP in the contract
documents, the obligation on the contractor to comply with these
conditions, and good site supervision by an independent engineer to
ensure that the contractor complies with the contract documents. A list of
clauses to be incorporated in the contract documents is provided in
Appendix B.
*      Regular cleaning and necessay maintenance. During the operational phase,
impacts on the quality of irrigation water will be mitigated through routine
maintenance activities, such as de-silting the irrigation channels. These
types of activities are the responsibility of the WIUAs.
*      Farming Interventions. A set of realistic, easily achieved, and relatively low
cost measures to improve agricultural practices in the short to medium
term have been prepared (Halcrow, 2001b) and should be adopted by
farmers. For the purposes of this project, this will be achieved by training
of trainers in more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. The
mitigation plan includes a component for Technical Assistance in the
training of staff of the PMU. A list of possible issues to be covered is
present in Appendix C.
12.4                Monitoring Plan
12.4.1              The EnvironmentalMonitoring and Evaluation System (EMES)
Environmental monitoring may be defined as the collection of specific
information on the characteristics, quantities and functioning of the environmental
variables over space and time. Monitoring evaluation is the analysis and
interpretation of this collected information to determine trends in space and time.
Regular monitoring of key parameters is necessary to measure environmental
change and to give an early warning so that corrective action can be taken.
12.4.2              Baseline Monitoring Programme
A monitoring programme was designed under the SIDRP and implemented during
2003. Monitoring consisted predominantly of the collection of water samples from
scheme drains and analysis for those components that may adversely affect
119



downstream projects or the aqueous environment, particularly impact upon nature
reserves such as the Narta lagoon.
Samples were analysed for salinity, nitrogen (both ammonium-nitrogen and nitrate-
nitrogen) and phosphate. Pesticide residues were not included since intensive
earlier work in the Lushnje district (Halcrow 2001 a) indicated that the modem
pesticides now in use did not constitute a serious hazard. Furthermore such
pesticides rapidly break down in the aqueous environment and concentrations
depend upon residence time on the field and in the drain, making collection and
interpretation of any data extremely difficult.
The monitoring data collected over the first twelve month period was reviewed by
Halcrow (2003) and has been used to inform the environmental impact assessment
for the six schemes reviewed in this EIA report. The review confirmed previous
work that showed that the present level of environmental impact was minor. The
monitoring programme will continue.
12.4.3             Future Monitoring Programme
At this stage regular monitoring is only proposed for a few key parameters that are
relatively easy to measure yet will give an early indication of possible unwanted
changes. Additional measurements could always be included at a later stage should
agricultural cropping develop commercially with more intensive farming systems
or to comply with future environmental legislation.
The focus of the monitoring programme is placed on those parameters that appear
to be crucial. These are public health, groundwater conditions and scheme effluent
quality.
The recommended approach is:
*      Installation of groundwater observation sites to measure changes in water
level and water salinity.
*      Establishment of monitoring sites and flow gauges at the location (or
locations) where drainage water is discharged from the scheme.
*      Monitoring of the quality of well water used for domestic purposes.
*      Monitoring of the discharge of domestic sewage to drains as part of a
drain monitoring campaign.

Monitoring, and the associated laboratory costs for analyses, is often an expensive
undertaking and yet it is vitally necessary for the sustainability of any irrigation
scheme to guard against adverse impacts such as rising groundwater tables and soil
salinisation. The health and welfare of the rural (and often urban) population
depends upon the quality of scheme water for potable supplies, the harvesting of
fish and frogs for consumption, and for recreational use. Therefore checks are
needed on the quality of drain water discharged into rivers. Agricultural drain water
discharges to rivers that connect to sensitive lagoons or sea with the potential for
impact upon the biosphere. Monitoring provides information on nutrient levels
and pesticides that can affect water quality and aquatic life.
The following recommendations for implementation are considered to be the
minimum necessary:
(a)    Scheme water tables (groundwater)
Depth to water to be measured and sampled at three month intervals (months
September, December, March andJune). In situ measures of chemical analysis for
electrical conductivity (EC) only.
(b)    Rural Drinking Water Supply Wells
Samples to be collected at six month intervals during April and September and
analysed for faecal coliform, phosphates and nitrate, nitrite and ammonium.
(c)    Drainage Water Within Scheme
Samples to be collected at six month intervals during April and September, and
analysed for EC, phosphates, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and faecal coliforms.
(d)    Drainage water at discharge point(s)
A simple system to monitor drain water quality exported from each sub-project is
recommended. The assessment of water quality alone is not sufficient. It is the
quantity of the potential pollutant that is discharged downstream over time that is
the critical factor. Therefore the quantity of water flowing out of the system must
be determined as well as quality.
To monitor the quality (and quantity) of water leaving the scheme (downstream
environmental effect). Sample twice a year at the end of the winter cropping and at
the end of the summer cropping (March/April) but when the drains still
discharging. Record effluent volume and collect one bulk sample (several small
121



samples combined) and analyse for: salinity (EC), nitrate, nitrite, ammonium-
nitrogen, phosphate, sediment load, and pesticide residues.
12.4.4              Equipment Needs
Salinity is traditionally measured by a laboratory procedure that reports total
dissolved solids (TDS) in milligrams per litre. The procedure is both time and
energy dependent (evaporation of water) and requires sample transportation and
laboratory facilities. It is much simpler and more cost effective to measure the
electrical conductivity (EC) of waters and effluents directly at site by use of an
electrical conductivity meter. Modern EC meters are robust, easy to carry, easy to
use and relatively inexpensive. It is recommend that monitoring staff should be
provided with these instruments and trained to use them.
12.4.5              Evaluation and Reporting
Responsibility for the collection, sampling, analysis, and reporting of the data
should rest with the Environmental Specialist in the PMU.
The monitored data will be evaluated and reported at intervals of twelve months.
The evaluation will comprise the review of all data collected in the previous twelve
months and a comparison with earlier results and trends. Data wil be plotted
continually so that long-term trends can be seen. The conclusions drawn from this
exercise will form the main content of each annual report but would also include
tabulations of all quantitative data and simple statistical analysis as required to
illustrate the findings and trends.
The PMU will liaise with the scheme managers (WUAs and DBs) to ensure that
they are fully aware of any changes occurring, and in the case of negative impacts,
to attempt to identify the cause (or causes) of the problem.
The reports will be prepared by the end of each calendar year, after the cessation
of the irrigation period and collection and analysis of the last samples. The reports
should be automatically issued to the Ministry of Environment.
12.5                InstitutionalArmngements
12.5.1              Proposed InstitutionalArrangementsfor the EMP
The most suitable organisation to take overal responsibility for the
implementation of the EMP would be the PMU. The PMU has the logistical
122



resources necessary to organise the collection of samples and the contacts within
the schemes.
The PMU therefore would be responsible for the co-ordination of the monitoring
(in conjunction with the WUAs and DBs) and for the evaluation of the collected
data. However the technical range of the monitoring tasks (and the expertise in
analytical procedures) is such that different organisations would have to be sub-
contracted as necessary. The PMU would subcontract the work and exert overall
environmental control and take responsibility for the publication and
dissemination of the results.
12.6               Implementation of the EMP
12.6.1             Programme
(a)    Bidding Phase
The EMP will be annexed to the contract documents for each scheme, and the
main contract will include clauses for the protection of the environment.
Contractors will be required to prepare a short Method Statement to describe the
measures they will undertake to comply with the environmental conditions of
contract. This document will be evaluated as part of the bidding procedures.
(b)    Construction Phase
The PMU will appoint the contractor and a supervising engineer for each scheme.
The role of the supervising engineer is to ensure that the works are implemented
according to the contract documents, including design drawings, programme, and
special clauses such as those on the protection of the environment. The PMU will
also nominate a member of staff (Environmental Specialist) with responsibility for
overseeing the implementation of the EMP and environmental contract clauses for
all schemes.
(c)    Operations Phase
During the operational phase, the following activities
*      routine operational and maintenance activities
*      TA to the PMU field staff involved in the monitoring exercise
*      TA to the PMU agricultural staff (training of trainers) for messages on
best agricultural practices programme
*      Overall review and assessment of the data from the monitoring
programme by an international consultant

12.6.2              Bud,gets
A break down of the overall budget for the implementation of the EMP for first
phase schemes including the cost to be incurred for the remaining is summarised
in Table 12.4 below.
1Z2 7               Public Consultation and Disclosure
12.7.1              Public Consultation
There is a requirement for public consultation as part of the environmental
assessment process.
Public consultations have taken place to inform the local communities of the
proposal to rehabilitate the sub-projects, to obtain the opinions of farmers, and
others, on the merits of the scheme and to explain the environmental
consequences. Most meetings had an enthusiastic response from the public and
often more than 100 people participated, from government, local authorities,
stakeholders, the general public, NGOs and the regional environmental agency.
Minutes of these meetings are attached as Appendix D.
12.7.2              Disclosure of Information
It is recommended that the annual monitoring reports (and data) are made
available to any public person who requests the information. Consideration should
be given to publication of the annual monitoring report under the environmental
review prepared every year by the Ministry of the Environment.
12.8                Post-Project Evaluation
It is normal practice to undertake a detailed environmental post-evaluation at some
time following scheme rehabilitation. These schemes are quite small and a major
effort is not justified unless the monitoring programmes reveal changes that were
not predicted at this initial stage of rehabilitation. Schemes that might fall into this
category are those of Shkoder and Vlore that discharge some drain effluent into
biologically sensitive habitats (the Veluni lagoon and Narta lagoon respectively).

13                  Conclusions over First Phase Schemes
Since all six irrigation programmes are concerned with rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure environmental impacts within schemes are mostly minor. There are
no sites of archaeological interest, despite the abundance of many such important
sites within Albania. Although two sites discharge water to areas of ecological
importance (Narta lake and Viluni lagoon), the impacts are expected to be very
small at the present. While more agrochemicals will be used following
rehabilitation, the concensus amongst agronomists is that agrochemical use will not
increase markedly and there will be a fairly long period of five years from
rehabilitation to full production development. This gives time for the monitoring
programme to assess the increase in agrochemical content in drain waters and for
the mitigating measures included in the Best Agricultural Practices programme to
take effect.
Improved irrigation and drainage will reduce waterlogging and increase crop
production, maintaining sustainability by ensuring salinity control. Salinity is not an
issue in these sub-projects and any small amounts of salt that may accumulate
temporarily, following use of drain water, are quickly removed in the following
rainy season. Some areas, near the sea, are saline, due to a combination o f saline
groundwater and natural poor drainage. Only very small areas of slightly saline
land, easily reclaimed given water and drainage, have been included in the
rehabilitation programme. All the schemes will have considerable social and socio-
economic benefits derived from increased incomes, increased employment
opportunities, enhanced land values, improved nutrition of both humans and
animals, overall improvement in health and an increase in the quality of life.
There are no significant upstream impacts for any of these schemes. Floods and
high sediment loads in winter result in the deposition of sediment against the
intake works, closed during this period. River bank erosion is a problem in places
such as Vlore.
Sediment in canals is less of a problem. Localised soil erosion or landslip may
occasionally occur from uplands bordering the course of canal or drain
143



These impacts are nitigated either by engineering works, properly costed as part of
the overall economic and financial assessments or by regular inspection and
maintenance.
The within scheme impacts, mainly related to use of agro-chemicals, are small at
present. The use of agro-chemicals is predicted to increase following rehabilitation,
although not markedly and the increase will be gradual as build up to full
production is expected to take five years.
The negative impacts predicted following rehabilitation are expected to be minor.
These will be mitigated through training programmes (training of trainers) for
farmers on best agricultural practices.
A monitoring programme to monitor all SIDRP schemes was designed by
Halcrow (2002) and implemented in 2003. Mfonitoring consisted predominantly of
the collection of water samples from scheme drains and analysis for those
components that may adversely affect downstream projects or the aqueous
environment, particularly impact upon nature reserves such as Narta lagoon. The
parameters measured were salinity, phosphates and nitrates.
The monitoring data collected over the first twelve month period was reviewed,
and the review confirmed previous work that showed the present environmental
impact of all the sub-projects was minor. The monitoring programme will continue
until the new monitoring programme is put in place.
Two sub-projects discharge drain water that eventually reaches nature reserves.
These are Shkoder SHU-4/9 and Vlore VLU-3 schemes. The potential impact
upon the reserves (based upon present data) is very minor since the quantities of
nitrogen and phosphate reaching the sites are low. Furthermore these sub-projects
are only one of several schemes that contribute drainage to the lagoons and any
serious assessment of impact must take into account the cumulative impact of all
potential contributors of pollutants, including inputs from urban areas. The
monitoring will continue following rehabilitation and will be extended to include
pesticide residues, once the change of agricultural practices can be established and
the type (and quantity) of pesticide determined.
The remaining works to be implemented under the proposed Project are generally
small scale, relating mainly to the rehabilitation of the secondary distribution
144



system. There are some larger features that still need to be constructed such as
primary canal system and headworks (Fier, Lezhe, Shkoder and Vlore).
During construction potential impacts include nuisances to workers and farmers
due to construction noise and dust, interference with farming activities, soil
compaction; pollution of soils and water from accidental spillages e.g. lubricants
and fuels, erosion and siltation; and waste disposal issues mainly for inert
construction materials. The impacts are expected to be negative, minor and
temporary. These impacts will be mitigated through standard good housekeeping
measures that will be included in the contractors contract and checked at regular
intervals by the supervising engineer.
In summary, the minor adverse impacts identified for the post rehabilitation phase
can be mitigated through improved agricultural practices and are greatly
outweighed by the socio-economic benefits to farmers and the local community.

14                 Environmental Management Plan
Framework
14.1               Introduction
This Section presents the general procedures as well as implementation
arrangements for ensuring full consideration of environmental safeguards in the
implementation of irrigation and drainage rehabilitation, flood control and dam
safety improvements works financed under the proposed WRMP. The procedures
describe here deal with only environmental categories B and C schemes.
Procedures for any environmental category A scheme would be developed on a
case by case and in consultation with the World Bank.
14.2               Environmental Review and Approval Process
14.2.1             Screening and Environmental Classification
As described in Section 2, in Albania there are regulations that make control and
supervision of construction works mandatory. The current legislation specifies
procedures required for obtaining environmental permit, based on the nature of
activities irnpied. The EIA Act requires an environmental impact assessment
(EIA) and public participation in the decision-making.
Under the proposed project, the screening of sub-project proposals and the
assessment of their environmental impact and proposed mitigation measures will
be carried out by PMU staff and/or consultants A simple screening of sub-
projects will determine what type of environmental assessment is required, based
on a project typology.
Environmental Screening
An environmental checklist of the likely items that may affect rehabilitation
schemes has been prepared, based upon a review of previous experience, as an aid
for design engineers, local consultants and PMU staff to guide them towards an
understanding of the environmental factors that need to be considered during the
planning for rehabi]itation of irrigation and drainage schemes. Table 14 1 addresses
those possible areas (within an Albanian context) that impinge upon the physical,
biological and human environment.

Negative impacts are recorded so that an assessment can be made of the severity
of the problem. In practice many of these impacts will be such that they can be
offset by adoption of a best agricultural practice approach (Halcrow, 2001c) or
sympathetic engineering design or by compensation (loss of land or amenity).
These mitigation measures become part of the costs of rehabilitation (see Halcrow,
2004).
The checklist also allows for the identification of any possible critical issues where
another professional opinion may be needed. The Regional Environmental Agency
should always be consulted for advice at an early stage of any studies. Their
opinion may be necessary where severe pollution may be a problem (for example
crude oil or waste products of industry or mining) or for any projects that
discharge drain water upstream of ecologically sensitive lands such as the coastal
lagoons or major lakes. The major lakes of Albania are particularly sensitive
environments as they are not only biologically important but share an international
148



boundary (Lake Shkodra, Lake Ohrit) or boundaries (Lake Prespes). The river
Bunes, downstream of Shkoder, is a biologically important river and shares a
common boundary with Montenegro. Abstractions from, or discharges to, such
environments are subject to intemational agreements.
Agriculture is at a stage where the future trends are not clear. There may be in the
future land consolidation and more intensive farming on a larger scale, or new
crops may be introduced. Monitoring of schemes is now used to check that the
earlier operational predictions were correct and to ensure that the scheme complies
with environmental regulations specified by the Govemment. The environmental
licence to proceed will contain mandatory requirements to monitor certain aspects
( LEP,Article 35). Monitoring is a relatively new concept in Albania but one that
needs to be carefully considered, especially for schemes that may have (or be
considered by others to have) a degrading effect upon the natural habitat. It is
better to pre-empt possible unnecessary criticism by proposing and implementing a
monitoring programme to ensure that any drainage into these habitats is measured.
There are plenty of examples of all these evaluations in the various sub-screening
reports submitted by consultants during 2000 to 2001 (Halcrow, 2000-2001a).
The environmental checklist is to be used in conjunction with the with the
environmental questionnaire provided in Appendix E. The questionnaire covers
most of the likely problems to be encountered whilst assessing a project scheme. It
will provide the essential information needed to complete the environmental
checklist. The checklist will then indicate what particular impacts are important and
this information can be used to screen and categotise the sub-project for the
necessary level of environmental assessment.
Table 14.2 is a sample of a typology for environmental classification, which will be
further elaborated before Project implementation and will be consistent with
recently adopted Albania legislation. Some sub-projects will not need an EIA and a
simple review may suffice, following the completion of the site environmental
questionnaire and the application of the checklist; some a limited environmental
assessment (LEA) and others may require an environmental impact assessment as
a World Bank Category B scheme that needs an EMP. Although Table 14.1 lists
environmental category A sub-projects that may require full environmental impact
assessment, it must be pointed out that procedures to be followed up for these
schemes will be developed in consultation with the World Bank.

Table 14.3:    Enviromnental Guidelines for Civil Work Contracts
Contractors will be oblige to apply environmentally sound construction standards and
procedures. AU civil works contracts will have the following environment-protecting provisions:
* Take measures and precautions to avoid adverse environmental impacts, nuisances or
disturbances arising from the execution o f the works. This shall be done by avoidance or
suppression whenever possible rather than abatement or mitigation of the impact once
generated.
* Comply with all environmental laws and regulation. Nominate staff to be responsible for
implementation of environmental actions and to receive guidance and instructions from the
engineer or environmental authorities.
* Minimize dust emissions to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on air quality.
* Maintain foot and vehicular traffic flows and public access to neighboring sites and facilities.
Provide markers, lights and temporary connections or bypasses for safety and convenience.
* Prevent or minimize vibration and noise from vehicles, equipment and blasting operations.
* Minimize disturbance to and restore vegetation disturbed as a consequence of the works.
Protect surface and groundwater and soil quality from pollution. Appropriately collect and
dispose of waste material.
More details can be found in Appendix B.
151



In all cases, contractors engaged in civil works will be provided with
Environmental Management Guidelines, listed in Table 14.2 bellow, which will
form an integral part of civil works contracts. All procurement documents will
specify that no environmentally unacceptable materials will be used, e.g., gravel
from unlicensed sites, among others..
14.2.2              Environmental Documentation
The PMU will commission the required document to address environmental issues
after consultation with REI staff. For sub-projects requiring LEA and EIA, site
specific Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) will be prepared to specify
mitigation, monlitoring, institutional arrangements. (A generic EMP is provided in
Appendix A).
14.2.3              Review and Approval
The documentation for the EMP will be sent to the REI for review and approval.
14.2.4              Consultation
The PMU will arrange with the participation of WUAs the public consultation with
sub-project stateholders and NGOs. Participation will be open to all interested
parties. Consultation often takes place after preparation of the draft ER, LEA or
EIA.
14.2.5              Disclosure
The respective document and EMP will be made available to interested parties at
the local REI, who will be responsible for making it available and disclosing it to
the public. The PMU will assist in the disclosure process.
14.3                InstitutionalArrangements
The PMU through its Environmental Expert (and the REI staff) must monitor
construction sites for ensuring that contractors comply with their contractual
obligations, including those relating environmental safety. In case of non-
compliance, the penalties and sanctions stipulated in a contract must be applied to
contractors including, if no other remedy exists, the suspension of the contract
until alternatives to environmentally harmful practices are identified.
As for the implementation of the EMP, the steps listed below will be followed.
152



*   Monitoring/data collection. Data will be generated by technical field staff
(i.e., DBs, HMI, REI, or contractors)
* Data analysis. This will be performed by specialist staff (either PMNU staff
or outsourced to external consultants). The REIs and PMU will be
responsible for reporting and disclosing information as well as archiving
and maintaining information.
* Evaluation. The REI will evaluate the reports and recommend actions to
the PMU.
14.4                Budget
The additional budget for incorporating environmental concerns in additional
rehabilitation works (about 20,000 ha) amounts to US$100,000, including
US$40,000 for monitoring and US$60,000 for commissioning environmental
review and limited environmental assessment reports.

Appendix B: Environmental Specifications in Contract Documents
The control of construction-related nuisances will be implemented through the preparation of contract
documents containing specific environmental and H&S clauses; the requirement on contractors to meet
the specification sin the contract documents; and supervision of contractors on site.
The Albanian Ministry of Environment (MoE) is committed to the environmental principles of
stewardship and sustainability and the Contractor is required to plan and order his activities to assist the
MoE to achieve these goals. In addition to this general requirement, particular areas for action are:
* Avoidance of pollution of any waters (surface or underground)
* Avoidance of pollution of land
*   Preservation of flora and fauna
*   Avoidance of the nuisance of noise, vibration and dust
The Contractor has to demonstrate in his written Statement of Method of Work his proposals to minimise
environmental impact and satisfy the above requirements. The following points should be addressed in
the Method Statement:
* Plant that leaks any fuel, lubricant or hydraulic fluid shall not be used
* Plant shall be maintained to ensure efficient operation and minimisation of emissions
* Fuel and oil shall be stored away from water courses (river, canal or drain) and fully protected by an
embankment to contain spills
*   Refueling, servicing and cleaning of plant shall be done in designated locations away from
watercourses
*   An adequate supply of oil absorbing material shall be readily available on site at all times
*   Any spills shall be immediately contained, removed from site and disposed to a licensed waste site.
Supervising Engineer to be informed
* All construction materials to be stored away from watercourses (river, canal, drain) and in such a
manner as to avoid contamination of agricultural land
*   Concrete shuttering to be designed to avoid escape of cement, especially if water contamination likely
* Working areas shall be defined with a demarcation fence to avoid damage to adjacent land/vegetation
* All trees and other vegetation shall be protected
*   Plant shall be effectively silenced and shall comply with the requirements of the Local Authority
*   Access over watercourse to be maintained during period of construction
*   Waste disposal must be carried out in a responsible and controlled manner. Contaminated or
hazardous substances such as soil, sediment or water polluted by crude oil must be deposited in an
agreed place, with the full agreement of the landowner(s), the Ministry of Health and the Regional
Environmental Agency.

Appendix C: Scope for Technical Assistance
It is necessary to establish clear philosophical and practical links between farming and the environment.
There is a clear need for a revitalised and profitable agricultural sector to proceed in an environmentally
friendly manner. Farmers have to be convinced that they are the principal protectors of the environment
as well as protecting the health and well-being of their families and the community.
Farming activity within the scheme areas is expected to increase once irrigation water supplies are
provided. The progression to full production is estimated to take place over five years, post rehabilitation.
This provides the opportunity to train PMU staff (who in turn will train members of the WUAs) in some
basic practices that will lessen the impact of agrochemicals on the environment. It will also present an
opportunity to explain the linkages between agrochemicals and public health, including the presence of
nitrates in well waters and the health risks associated with irrigation of vegetables using drain water and
the hazards of handling pesticides. A set of realistic, easily achieved, and relatively low cost measures to
improve agricultural practices in the short to medium term have been prepared (Halcrow, 2001).
The most important measures are:
(a)   Cultivation
*   Subsoiling to improve infiltration of water and reduce runoff
* Seedbeds of wheat left rough to increase infiltration and reduce runoff.
*   Cross slope cultivation in upland areas.
*   Check ridges if downslope cultivation practised.
*   Introduction of minimal cultivation techniques.
(b)   Crop Yields
*   Balanced input of nutrients
(c)   Cropping calendar
*   Increased area of winter cropping to limit loss of nitrogen
(d)   Nitrogen Fertiliser Control
*   Campaign to stop or substantially reduce the use of nitrogen on leguminous crops (alfalfa and
beans)
*   Campaign to set maximum limnits for nitrogen applications to wheat and maize.
(e)   Irrigation
*   Provision of on-farm water storage
*   Improved irrigation interval (where needed)
159



(f)   Drainage
*   Cleaning by farmers of tertiary drains
*   Location and unblocking of tile drain outlets
*   Cleaning of brazda surface drains
(g)   Farmyard manure
*   Protection of manure from rainfall (reducing loss of nitrogen)
*   Storage away from drains
(h)   Pesticides
*   Operator safety
*   Training of operators
*   Efficiency of spraying, reduction of drif

MINUTES OF MEETING
PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON ELU -1 AND FRU -3 IRRIGATION SCHEMES,
WHERE IT IS ANTICIPATED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SECOND
IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE REHABILITATION PROJECT
A Public Consultation was held on February 9, 2001 in Elbasan and Fieri Districts on ELUl and FRU-
3 schemes where it is anticipated to start the implementation of the project.
The following participated in the consultation: Mr. Ylli Dedja, Director of the Second Irrigation
Rehabilitation Project, and two specialists from the Project, Mr. Zamir Dedej, Director of
Enviromnental Protection Directory and two specialists from the Environmental Protection Directory
in the National Environmental Agency, Presidents of Federations And Water Users Associations of
these schemes and Naum Panxhi irrigation canal in Elbasan District, and Kurjan reservoir in Fieri
District. There were also invited directors of Agricultural Enterprises and Water Enterprises of the
above mentioned districts, specialists of Regional Environmental Agencies, Chiefs of Communes,
agronomists of Communes and Agricultural Enterprises, representatives of local units of all levels, and
NGO's representatives such as environmental culture, vegetable-potatoes, fishery, parks protection,
ecological club, etc.
This Public Consultation was advertised in three daily local newspapers.
All participants were provided with copies of material available for this Public Consultation on
environmental assessment carried out by the Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project.
The meeting was addressed by the Director of Agriculture and Food Directory of Elbasan District who
introduced the participants, the Consultation's outline and then MIr. Ylli Dedja took the floor.
Mr. Ylli Dedja summarized the achievements of the First Irrigation Rehabilitation Project and introduced
the Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project, results achieved by the project, and the positive
impact of the project implementation on environment protection. The implementation of this project
gives way to water management, prevents flooding, and minimizes erosion. Mr. Dedja emphasized the
criteria to be met in order to be included in the Second Project, such as:
-   Development of WUAs and Federations. WUAs establishement and organization into Federations;
-   Irrigation system transfer to WUAs and Federations before rehabilitation;
-   Co finance with 3000 lek/ha, in cases of irrigation by gravity the co finance should be 10% of all
investments for pumping stations rehabilitation and infrastructure to be rehabilitated;
-   WUAs membership should be over 90%.
172



Mr. Ylli Dedja introduced the phases of the rehabilitation process after contributions have been collected,
starting from preliminary studies on structures to rehabilitated, system transfer to WUAs or Federations,
participation of WUAs or Federations' representatives in all rehabilitation phases, like studies, design,
bidding process, supervision, implementation and completion of project.
Then Mr. Zamir Dedej, Director of Environmental Protection Directory in the National Environmental
Agency introduced the participants with the activities of this Agency, its role in protecting the
environment. He emphasized the importance of the environment, and the need for well studied
interventions to the environment. In the systems to be rehabilitated, the water to be used for irrigation
and the impact of the project on the environment are assessed. Mr. Dedej appreciated the studies carried
out by the Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project on the above schemes. He emphasized
that these studies are based on the rehabilitation of existing schemes, thus the impact of the project on the
environment should be positive and should improve and consolidate land. Some main indicators were
taken into consideration when carrying out these studies: quality of irrigation and drainage water, land
salinity, erosion and flood, use of fertilizers (pesticides, herbicides), etc.
Analysis of the schemes show that their impact is not a problem. Salinity, sediments, pollution of water,
etc. show that there will be no problems at the moment, however, erosion should be taken into
consideration and interventions should take place to avoid negative impacts in some places.
Another important aspect of the studies is the plan to have these indicators under control in the future
through a monitoring program recently introduced. This is important because WJUAs would be engaged
with these indicators and would avoid their negative impacts on these schemes. The National
Environmental Agency will co-operate with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and other responsible
institutions to follow the progress of the monitoring program and to keep under control all indicators
whose impact on the environment or people's health is negative.
Mr. Dedej wished that the project has the support of all the participants and its implementation start as
soon as possible.
Mr. Gjergj Papajani, WUA specialist in the Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project,
emphasized the important role of WUAs in managing irrigation and drainage, but in a protected
environment, transfer of works to WUAs (farmers themselves), positive aspects of the transfer.
The meeting went on with questions and discussions. The Director of the Agricultural Enterprise of
Elbasan District discussed about the work carried out by WUAs in this District in fulfilling the required
criteria, about the co-operation with the communes and other local entities, Agricultural Enterprise, Water
Enterprise and WUAs in order to fulfill these criteria. Advertisement and media have been very much of
help. He also emphasized AE's and WE's technical support to WUAs when required, the completion of
irrigation systems transfer and that the implementation of the foreseen schemes will positively influence
the environmental protection, and appreciated the studies carried out by the project.
173



The Chief of Gjergjan Commune emphasized the Commune's support to WIUAs, and that this area wiU
respond to the required criteria in order to enhance the implementation of the project. We, he said, will try
to convince farmers to pay their contributions.
The Director of the Agricultural Enterprise of Fieri District discussed about problems in this District. He
mentioned that Kurjani Federation is going to be established very soon, and irrigation works will be
transferred from the Water Enterprise to the Federation. He appreciated the studies carried out by the
project and their positive impact on the environment.
The President of Kuqan WUA in Elbasani District emphasized the necessity of project implementation in
this WUA and the good job in paying the contributions.
The President of Vidhishte WUA introduced the activity of this WUA, the transfer of irrigation works to
WUA, and collection of contributions up to 100%. They have already proved this a year ago when a
pumping station was rehabilitated in accordance with such criteria.
Other WIUA Presidents questioned and discussed, such as Zharrza WUA, Porteza WUA, Sheqishte WUA,
Kurjan WUA, and Kuman WUA of Fieri District, as well as the President of Naum Panxhi Federation,
Aliu WUA, Shkendia WUA, and Ferrasi WUA of Elbasan District.
Mr. Ylli Dedja and Mr. Zamir Dedej answered the questions, emphasizing once more the criteria to be
met in order to benefit from the Second Irrigation and Drainage Rehabilitation Project, and the
importance of environmental protection.

STATEMENT
OF SHKODRA MEETING, MARCH 10, 1999 ON
"PUBLIC CONSULTATION RELATING TO IMPACT OF IRRIGATION AND
REHABILITATION PROJECT ON ENVIRONMENT"
Looking forward to the starting of Second Irrigation and Rehabilitation Project, Project
Management Unit, in collaboration with Environmental National Agency, on march 10't, 1999
has organized a Public Consultation. The consultation has been concentrated on irrigation and
Drainage scheme of Lezha and Shkodra.
It was first consultation meeting in our practice on how to attract opinions of benefits farmers from the
investment also to disseminate, spread out and divulge idea relating further consequences of environmental
impact.
The consultation was attended from more 100 participants of two districts; WUA-s' presidents
cover Irrigation and Drainage scheme and respective associated drainage schemes, Directors of
DDAF and Water Enterprises, representatives of Local Governments and other extensionists.
Also have participated specialists of Environmental Regional Agencies.
Also, many responsible people from Malesia e Madhe have attended the meeting.
The PMU team was made up of its Director, Mr. Ylih Dede and three other specialists, and from
Environmental National Agency attended the seminar Mr Zamir Dedej, Director of Department
of nature Protection and Mr. Ermal Halimi and Adrian Tafilaj.
The above consultation has focused and treated some of main problems and expected impacts
on the environment of irrigation and drainage and how to meet "demand driven" requests.
PMU's Director, Mr. Ylli Dede presented a full picture of ongoing process of First Project, which
is nearly finishing. Later on he emphasized, some specifics of above schemes where are reflected
all contemporane and very restricted condition in order to prevent as much as possible the
environmental degradation. Due to above restriction, there are excluded every way of
deterioration of natural equilibrum. The design 'has taken into consideration expected
consequences, where their recovering will be very costly.
The main indicator of project impact on the environment is the avoiding as much as possible of
water logging and decreasing of solid discharge at very low level as possible through going deep
to the watershed characteristics.
Nevertheless all requests of Second Project that imply farmer self organization in WUA-s and
later on in federation including their participation in "demand driven", make up premises in
178



order to establish a very sustainable irrigation and drainage system aiming to increase the
community feeling on the ownership of rehabilitated works. Also is expected to reach some very
important objectives such as how to protect the environment also how to create a very
sustainable situation where the androgen factors will influence in a very controlled and restricted
way and not in spontaneous manner,
Mr. Zamir Dedej emphasized again that is satisfied concerning the projects of above schemes
and none negative influence is revealed. Nevertheless the divulgation of such idea to the users is
indispensability indeed as those indicator before used to be ignored.
Nowadays based in legislation into force, couldn't be tolerated the approval of all projects seen
by environmental impacts' point of view .The national Environmental Agency is charged to
cheek in above projects.
In a comprehensive term we can say that seminar was concentrated on following topics such as:
Irrigation water quality, the possibilities to reuse drainage water, avoiding of further salinisation
by overusing or not taking into consideration of scientific criteria of pesticides and fertilizers.
Also is needed the establishment of monitoring program on the implementation ongoing process
by choosing of main indicators to measure above influence.
Irrespective that above meeting is first, everybody could take in evidence the increasing sensibility
of project beneficiaries relating to environmental impact.
More or less all kind of participants including extensionists, WUA-s presidents and local
government representatives have expressed their attitude toward environmental protection.
There have debated and discussed Chairman of Commune of Blinsht, Lezha, WUA's president
of Postriba, Shkodra, Chairman of Bushati Commune, WUA's president of Gjadri, Lezha,
WUA's president of Bushati, Shkodra, WUA's president of Berdica, also many extensionists of
two districts.
The above meeting had the contribution of Mr. Wob Groot, World Bank Consulent. Mr. Wob
Groot has underlined and emphasized many important issues starting with the investigation of
very old institutional tradition concerning irrigation in that region. Also he draw attention of
participants on how to estimate those impacts which individually couldn't be solved.

All surplus scheme water will contain pollutants such as salts, agricultural chemicals, nitrates,
phosphates, sewage, various organic and inorganic compounds and metals arising from human
183



habitation, industry and agricultural operations. This polluted water will leave the scheme,
probably by discharge to a river and may cause environmental problems downstream.

downstream? Any large towns that depend upon the river water for drinking water or industry?
G Upstream Problems
Some scheme problems may result from events taking place upstream of the scheme water
intake. There may be industrial pollutants, material washed from mine spoil by winter rains, or
other material from waste dumps. Please indicate any known problems related to water quality of
river (or drain if used for irrigation- salt content, biological oxygen demand, toxic heavy metals,
insecticides, phosphates, nitrates, sediment.
Alternatively if data not available please list major upstream industries or irrigation schemes
disposing of effluent into the scheme river supply.
