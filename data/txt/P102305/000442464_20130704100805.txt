F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective of the project is to minimize the threat posed by highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) to humans in Bangladesh by controlling such infections in domestic poultry,
and preparing for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an
influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the
interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and other types
of infectious diseases, in terms of building overall response capacity in the country.

H. Restructuring (if any)

Due to donor-funded activities underway prior to appraisal and slow implementation
progress at the beginning of the project, the GoB requested through the Ministry of
Finance (07 April 2009) and the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock (10 May 2009) the
cancellation of US$4 million of the IDA credit. At MTR, in July 2009, in consultation
with involved donors and GoB, the project Financing Agreement was restructured
reducing the project scope and related IDA credit from the original $16m to $12m. This
became effective on countersigning on 25 January 2010. However, given the impact of
this down-sizing on some of the project components, MTR missed the opportunity to
fully restructure the project.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

The project was developed as an emergency operation to respond to massive avian flu
outbreaks in Bangladesh that began in April 2006. The potential impact of the outbreaks
to the health of this densely populated country was considerable, especially where the
first-responder veterinary service capacity was very weak. The project was requested by
GoB and its framework follows the Bank’s GPAI Technical Annex template.

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.1.1 The Country. Bangladesh had a population of approximately 145 million and a
national poultry flock of 152 million of all types of poultry. With a population density of
1,072 people per km2 and a poultry density of 1,194 per km2, Bangladesh posts one of the
densest human and poultry populations in the world.2 About 75 percent of the population
lives in rural areas and depends heavily on poultry as a source of meat and household
income. The combined high population density and low socioeconomic status contribute
to a high burden of infectious diseases, which make Bangladesh prone to zoonotic disease
outbreaks that can spread rapidly from animals to humans.

1.1.2 Avian Influenza. The country lies under several important migratory bird
flyways, with resting places along several of the great river courses, wetlands, and
estuaries that transect the country—increasing its risk to the introduction of HPAI by
infected migratory birds from elsewhere. Bangladesh experienced its first HPAI outbreak
wave between February and May 2007, with a second wave between September 2007 and
May 2008. The first human case was identified in January 2008. By the end of the project
(EoP), there were six human clinical cases but no deaths.3 Since the first outbreak in
April 2007, five seasonal outbreak waves have followed, with signs of an early
commencement of a sixth wave. By EoP, 550 outbreaks had occurred, infecting 52 of 64
districts. Outbreaks on commercial farms comprised 83 percent of the total, indicating
that biosecurity on these farms remains weak. Borders between Bangladesh and
neighboring India and Myanmar—both avian flu-infected countries—are porous, further
increasing the threat of transboundary infection. In 2011, crows infected with a new
variant of the virus (clade 2.3.2.1) were identified, which may lead to the belief that the
entrenchment of the disease could be caused by migratory wild birds.

1.1.3 Poultry Farm Biosecurity. The consistently high infection rate, stood at a 4.7 to
1 ratio between commercial farms and backyard poultry, based on outbreak data
collected, and points at serious biosecurity weaknesses in the commercial poultry sector.
Biosecurity along the poultry market chain is very weak and a major contributor to the
continuing circulation of the HPAI virus. Some 55 percent of poultry are kept under free-
ranging backyard conditions without any degree of biosecurity. Village poultry farms

 FAO AIDE News, Issue 31, January-March 2012. In 2012, three of the human cases identified were
present in one LBM in the metropolitan Dhaka area, suggesting that LBMs can contribute to the spread of
HPAI to poultry as well as humans. HPAI virus has been isolated from other LBMs across Bangladesh.

                                                  1
frequently are built side by side, with only a few meters of separation, promoting the
spread of H5N1. Live bird market (LBM) structures in the larger towns stem from
colonial days, and are dilapidated without any water supply or means of disinfection. In
smaller villages, LBMs are located along roadsides without any infrastructure.

1.1.4 Agencies Involved in Avian Influenza. Within the Ministry of Fisheries and
Livestock (MOFL), the two main agencies concerned with avian influenza control are the
Department of Livestock Services (DLS) and the Bangladesh Livestock Research
Institute (BLRI). The DLS has 5 Divisional Livestock Offices, 64 District Livestock
Offices, 464 Upazila (sub-district) Offices, 1 Central Disease Investigation Laboratory
(CDIL), and 7 Field Disease Investigation Laboratories (FDIL). Each upazila is staffed
by 2 to 3 Upazila Livestock Officers (including veterinarians) and support staff,
responsible for disease surveillance and reporting. At appraisal, the 7 FDILs were unable
to undertake any avian influenza diagnostic work due to lack of equipment, consumables
and training. The BLRI was established in 1985 and is a semi-autonomous agency within
MOFL.  

1.2     Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
        approved)
1.2.1 The overall objective of the project is to minimize the threat posed by HPAI to
humans in Bangladesh by controlling such infections in domestic poultry, and preparing
for, controlling, and responding to possible human infections, especially an influenza
epidemic and related emergencies. Though the objective is specific to HPAI, the
interventions are expected to contribute to the control of other zoonotic diseases and
other types of infectious diseases, by building the country’s overall response capacity.

1.2.2 This objective was to be achieved through three types of interventions: (i)
prevention; (ii) preparedness and planning; and (iii) response and containment. If these
types of interventions achieved their goals, the proposed project would reduce the burden
of HPAI in poultry and the consequent economic losses. It would also lower the risk of
human infection and the loss of productivity attributable to human infections in
Bangladesh. Finally, it would limit the risk of HPAI in other countries. 

1.2.3 By end of project, it was expected that (i) the capacity of the agencies involved in
HPAI containment, control and mitigation would be improved; (ii) the threat to human
health in the high-risk areas of Bangladesh would be reduced; and (iii) the general public
will be better aware of, and would have adopted AI-related human health, animal health,
and environmental safeguards.

1.3     Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key
        Indicators, and Reasons/Justification
1.3.1 The PDO and Key Indicators have remained unchanged. At MTR, one additional
intermediate outcome indicator was added to the Animal Health component to address
the need for the closer monitoring of biosecurity along the poultry market chain. The
indicator tracked the progress of the newly introduced piloted, integrated Biosecure
Poultry Market Chains (BPMC).

                                            2
1.4   Main Beneficiaries
1.4.1 The project was aimed at several groups of beneficiaries:

    a) The primary target beneficiaries were the five million commercial poultry farmers
       and poor households whose livelihoods benefitted directly or indirectly from
       project interventions;
    b) Veterinary diagnostic laboratories, the research institution BLRI, the CDIL, and
       the disease surveillance system;
    c) The implementing ministry MOFL and its DLS, which benefitted significantly
       from human and physical capacity building, and from institutional strengthening;
    d) Consumers and other poultry chain stakeholders who benefitted from science-
       based information and awareness of the risks of HPAI to poultry and human
       health; and
    e) Targeted consumers with access to nine hygienically operated biosecure LBMs
       from which they can buy safe poultry meat and eggs.

1.5     Original Components
1.5.1 Given limited implementation capacity of DLS at project onset, the project design
of three components comprising 11 subcomponents, all with national scope, was quite
ambitious. 4 Other donors and ongoing GoB activities alleviated some complexities
related to emergency supply delivery, surveillance, and biosecurity improvements in
selected LBMs, and diagnostic laboratory training. The project was financed as an ERL
by AHITF US$2m, GoB US$3m and IDA US$16m, of which IDA US$4m was cancelled
in June 2009.

1.5.2 Component I - Animal Health (US$5.7 million; 79 percent of total project cost),
This component supported enhancement of prevention and preparedness, strengthening
disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity, strengthening control programs, improving
biosecurity, support for surveillance of migratory birds, and a contingency fund. A multi-
member FAO/TAS team, scheduled to arrive in October 2009, supported the technical
aspects of the PCU implementation under DLS.

  The project was co-financed by the Government of Bangladesh, the International Development
Association (IDA Credit No. 4340-BD), and AHI Trust Fund (Grant No. TF090662-BD). Trust Fund
donors include the European Commission, the United Kingdom-DFID, Australia-AusAID, the Russian
Federation, the Peoples’ Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Iceland, Slovenia, and Estonia.
5
  GoB designated MOFL and MOHFW to implement its National Avian Influenza Plan (NAIP), with
appropriate support from other agencies, including MOEF and MOI. A National Advisory Committee
(NAC) comprised of 16 Ministers and a representative of the Prime Minister’s Secretariat was designated
as the apex coordinating body. Beneath the NAC, a National Multi-Sectoral Task Force (NMTF) has been
established with representation from a wide range of public and private sector agencies. The cost for
implementing the plan is being borne by GoB.

1.5.3 Component II: Public Awareness and Information Component (US$0.315
million; 9 percent of total project cost), to improve public awareness and information
about HPAI to safeguard the human health of the general public, extension staff, animal
health workers, poultry producers, poultry traders, poultry processors, and other poultry
sector stakeholders. The component supported implementation of the National
Communication Strategy and Action Plan to introduce innovative and best-practice
examples to strengthen communication activities.

closely on monitoring and eradication programs, and thereby gained the necessary inter-agency experience.

1.5.4 Component III: Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation
Component (US$0.945 million; 12 percent of total project cost). This component had
two sub-components:
   Subcomponent III.A - Implementation and Technical Support (a) establishment
     of Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within DLS for project implementation,
     coordination and management, communications, procurement, financial
     management, safeguards, and implementation management; (b) technical assistance

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
Several factors affected implementation and outcomes, as covered below. These were:
the multi-donor assistance already underway before project onset, which impacted on the
evaluation of the project’s sole impact; the delayed arrival of the FAO/TAS Team, which
delayed a number of important project activities, most important of which was
monitoring and evaluation.

2.1.1 Bank involvement. Bank involvement was justified, given the global public good
of HPAI – especially the possibility of a pandemic – and other emerging and reemerging
transboundary zoonotic diseases. The 2007 H5N1 outbreaks in Bangladesh, and in

  The M&E expert arrived three years after the GoB requested long-term FAO assistance. A baseline was
prepared after the expert’s arrival, and thereafter the PCU implementation capacity and M&E began to
improve.

                                                 5
neighboring India and Myanmar in early 2006, highlighted that Bangladesh was at high
risk. An urgent need existed to assist government in strengthening veterinary services,
communication/public awareness infrastructure, and compensation policy.

2.1.2 Collaborative Assistance for Project Preparation and Implementation. Prior
to the first avian flu outbreaks in early 2007, UNICEF assisted GoB in development of a
risk communication strategy, and NAIP was developed, assisted by FAO, WHO and OIE.
Several agencies were already supporting activities related to veterinary services. Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) supported development of the poultry industry
and Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) modernization of BLRI.
When Bangladesh was declared an endemic country, DANIDA (BLRI laboratory) and
JICA (regional risk communication) expanded their programs. Other donors and agencies
began funding projects focusing on the control and containment of HPAI. FAO supported
short-term emergency response teams; USAID the construction of 26 biosecure live-bird
markets, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) the establishment of an HPAI Technical
Unit (TU) within DLS. Other donors supplied PPE, disinfectants and other emergency
supplies. USAID committed around $20 million to finance different aspects of HPAI
control (the Stop.AI program, building biosecure LBMs including success in closing
major LBMs in Dhaka once a week for disinfection, the SMS Gateway and LDS, salaries
for 15 national and international experts until 2014). All these were provided as grants.
UNICEF developed a risk communication strategy which was adopted and published in
2008.

2.1.3 Project Design. The AIPRP design was developed to mesh into already ongoing
activities by other development partners with whom the Bank share credit for eventual
progress towards the achievement of the projects’ development objectives. The World
Bank’s involvement was justified under the framework of the Global Program for Avian
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI). 9 The
project was processed under the Bank’s emergency operation guidelines (OP/BP 8.50),
which allow for the issuance of Emergency Recovery Loans (ERL) that can be used for
the quick disbursing of project activities without due attention to long-term sector,
economic policies. Given the impact of HPAI interventions in the high-risk environment
of Bangladesh, the global public good aspects to strengthen capacity to contain HPAI,
and other transboundary animal and human diseases, was well justified.

2.1.4 Quality at Entry. At entry, there were weaknesses in the design of the project
relating to (i) its complexity relative to local implementation capacity at appraisal; (ii)
overestimation of the budget which resulted from an under-evaluation of other



9
  The World Bank’s Board of Directors endorsed GPAI in January 2006 as a horizontal Adaptable Program
Loan with a global fund of US$500 million. When GPAI was set up in 2005, when H5N1 in humans was at
its height in Asia. As avian flu virus strains evolve constantly with unpredictable results, the risk of a
human pandemic was considered high. Any intervention would have to be multi-sectoral, involving health,
agriculture, economics, finance, planning, and other sectors. The World Bank was considered the most
suitable institution to coordinate the response among the United Nations and its technical partner agencies
FAO, UNICEF, and the World Health Organization (WHO).

                                                    6
development partners’ contribution to the initiative and later the cancellation of 25% of
the loan package; (iii) unpreparedness for implementation of institutional and
procurement arrangements, including FAO assistance; and (iv) weak monitoring and
evaluation framework. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) would have uncovered
these constraints and weaknesses.

2.1.5 Government Involvement. GoB engaged early, established a PCU under DLS,
adopted and Operation Manual, and deployed the already existing NAIP, the Risk
Communication Strategy, and the Compensation Plan. DLS, under the Ministry of
Fisheries and Livestock (MOFL), implemented the Animal Health component. The
Department of Mass Communication (DMC) under Ministry of Information collaborated
with DLS to implement parts of the public awareness and information component. 10
Since MOHFW implemented the Human Health component under a different project,
DLS assigned a liaison officer to maintain linkages with that component’s
implementation progress. The DLS and MOHFW established joint Rapid Reaction
Teams in 481 Upazilas which cooperated continuously in such areas as the culling of
exposed poultry, surveillance and administration of prophylaxis to in-contact persons,
and information sharing to minimize the threat to human health posed by the disease.
GoB contracted an FAO/TAS team11 to assist in the technical implementation aspects.
However, strong M&E capacity was compromised by the late completion of a baseline
study, further compounded by the late arrival of the FAO/TAS M&E experts. However,
the design failed to take into account the critical role of wild birds in maintaining the
circulation of the HPAI virus and by so doing failed to involve the Department of
Forestry (DOF) at the level as MOFL and MOHFW.

2.1.6 Assessment of Risks at Entry. The project’s Technical Annex appraisal rated the
overall risk assessment of the project and FM as Substantial, based on the rapidly
spreading HPAI epidemic in the face of the weak implementation capacity of DLS and
equally weak FM capacity. Risk of government commitment, implementation, and
laboratory capacity were rated High, based on institutional and technical weaknesses.
Access to collaborating agencies (FAO), initially rated Medium, was raised to High as the
result of serious delays in the arrival of the FAO/TAS Team. Lack of Government
commitment, initially rated High, turned out to be Low, as GoB demonstrated continuous
vigilance in combatting and marshaling resources to avian flu containment. Risk
assessment at appraisal did not foresee the importance of poultry chain biosecurity as a
significant factor in controlling avian flu, which should have been rated High, which was
only identified and addressed following MTR.




10
   MOHFW implemented the Human Health component under the avian influenza component of HNPSP.
MOI signed a MoU with DLS to implement the public awareness and information component, assisted by a
national consulting firm.
11
   The FAO/TAS team comprised a Team Leader/avian influenza expert, an international and national
M&E expert, a national communications expert, and a national community-based surveillance expert.

                                                 7
2.2     Implementation
Overall project implementation was delayed as the result of: (i) delay in hiring FAO for
technical assistance to the PCU (initiation was delayed by GoB and MoFL and the
Development Project Performa (DPP) had to be revised among other things to
accommodate the payment of VAT from GoB funds in lieu of VAT due from FAO staff);
and (ii) PCU staff lack of skills and experience in project management, particularly
dealing with Bank procurement.

2.2.1 Project Changes at MTR (mission of July-August 2009). Two major changes
took place: (i) A subcomponent entitled Biosecure Poultry Market Chains (BPMC) was
added to the Animal Health component in 2011, comprising the establishment of nine
piloted biosecurity poultry market chains in nine of the Districts at highest risk to HPAI;
and (ii) As the result of donor-funded activities underway prior to appraisal, the MTR, in
consultation with involved donors and at the request of GoB – through the Ministry of
Finance (07 April 2009) and the MoFL (10 May 2009) – restructured the project
Financing Agreement reducing the project scope and related IDA credit from the original
US$16m to US$12m. The enabling document was countersigned on 25 January 2010 to
effect the cancellation of US$4m. Given the impacts of this reduction on some of the
major components of the project, the MTR came short of fully restructuring the project
based on an in-depth analysis of the scope of such impacts.

2.2.2 The impact of several activities of which IDA budgets were reduced during the
2009 MTR mission should have been more closely evaluated. For example, budgets for
outbreak containment plans, biosecurity and the compensation fund contingency were
reduced between 46 and 54 percent, even though these activities turned out to be
instrumental in contributing to more effective containment measures that might have
further reduced the outbreak incidence. Other items, such as capacity building for public
awareness, were reduced to ensure improved synergism between project and non-project
supported activities. On the other hand, IDA budgets for technical implementation
support and M&E were substantially increased.12

2.2.3 However, notable progress in implementation progress began in late 2010 after
GoB completed the long pending approval of its revised DPP, followed by signing an
equally long pending FAO/TAS team contract in April 2010, and the hiring of staff to
strengthen the PCU. This resulted in achieving the following project development
outcomes: (i) enhanced surveillance capacity leading to the reduction in infectious period
(time between reporting and culling) from 4.8 days to 1.4 days;13 (ii) 70 percent reduction
in outbreaks at EoP relative to baseline; (iii) strengthened capacity for accurate diagnosis
of HPAI and its molecular characterization by gene sequencing; (iv) a responsive, timely,
equitable, and transparently implemented compensation scheme; and (v) the emergence

   An ex post analysis of the Bangladesh HPAI outbreak data, using simple compartmental Susceptible-
Infectious (SI) model, shows that this reduction in infectious period alone reduced the equilibrium
prevalence rate from 30.58 percent to 11.69 percent, thus greatly contributing to control and containment
efforts (Annex 3).

2.2.4 Component I: Animal Health
The overall implementation of this component was Moderately Satisfactory. The
reduction of response time from outbreak to culling from 4.8 days to 1.4 days and
reaching laboratory diagnostic accuracy for HPAI of 98 percent are key achievements
and compare favorably with world standards. However, Bangladesh still had 21
outbreaks recorded in 2012 – the highest incidence of HPAI in the South Asia region and
one of six countries where HPAI remains endemic, which remains a cause for continued
concern.14 Weak poultry farm biosecurity and potential seasonal reinfection by migratory
birds remain obstacles to successful control and eradication.

        Enhancing Prevention and Preparedness Capability. The 2006-2008 NAIP
         was adopted, published, and updated to cover 2009-2016 to reflect new priorities
         related to institutional strengthening, diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and
         communications and information. The OIE completed its review of national
         veterinary services in October 2011, based on which DLS prepared a
         reorganization plan to (i) internalize budget to support the upgraded surveillance
         provided by enhanced surveillance, epidemiology and laboratory diagnosis; (ii)
         expand the Livestock Disease System to monitor all livestock species; (iii)
         support the newly established epidemiology unit; (iv) support the full staffing,
         training and operations of the renovated FDILs; and (v) streamline disease
         information flows between the FDILs, BLRI, CDIL, and DLS.

        Strengthening Disease Surveillance and Diagnostic Capacity. Disease
         surveillance and diagnostic capacity were significantly strengthened. On
         surveillance (i) commercial poultry farms across the country, including their
         poultry inventories, were registered and geo-referenced, allowing for rapid
         identification of infected farms; (ii) 306 high-risk upazilas receive priority
         monitoring by 1,117 SMS gateway workers, resulting in reduction of outbreak
         response time from 4.8 days to 1.4 days; (iii) over 86 percent of outbreaks are
         now covered by the SMS Gateway, compared to 14 percent passively reported
         cases by farmers; (iv) community-based surveillance was established and linked
         to the SMS Gateway system; and (v) a total of 22,057 person-days of training for
         surveillance workers, and 28,898 person-days for 1,888 poultry farmers,
         containment personnel, animal health workers, and veterinary staff at supervisory
         and field investigation levels of surveillance received training equivalent to


14
   The same analysis above confirmed a high likelihood of sustained endemicity if control efforts continued
to depend on separate single rather than integrated packages of interventions (Annex 3). The results support
the concept of BMPC entailing broadening control efforts to take into consideration the capacities,
practices, and incentives of all poultry value chain stakeholders. When completed and fully functional, the
pilot BMPC will play crucial roles in further weakening the probability of spread of the virus, especially
when coupled with the observation of weekly rest days in all LBMs.

                                                     9
    22,057 person-days and 288 person-days for FDIL laboratory workers. On
    diagnostic capacity, (i) seven existing FDILs were renovated and two new FDILs
    were constructed, equipped, and supplied with consumables; (ii) diagnostic
    capacity has been enhanced in the diagnosis of avian flu and other emergency
    diseases; and (iii) capacity was established in virus characterization by gene
    sequencing. Current diagnostic accuracy at BLRI for HPAI virus is internationally
    benchmarked at 98.2 percent. Diagnostic capacity of the veterinary diagnostic
    laboratory system was substantially strengthened. At project onset, FDIL staffing
    was only 30 percent of required level, and improved to 63 percent by EoP. Further
    staff recruitment is in progress.

   Strengthening Control Programs and Containment Plans. With initial
    assistance from Sweden, later continued by USAID and taken over by the project,
    DLS used the SMS Gateway system for rapid detection of outbreaks and fielding
    rapid response teams (RRT) to cull sick and in-contact poultry. By EoP, the
    project supported the monitoring of 306 high-risk upazilas by the SMS Gateway
    system, identified and contained 550 outbreaks, entailing the culling of a total of
    3.46 million poultry and destruction of 2.97 million eggs belonging to 822
    farmers. Although this system has worked well, seasonal outbreaks have
    continued, primarily as the result of continuing weak farm biosecurity and
    possible re-infection by the overflying and resting of HPAI-carrying migratory
    birds. Initially, neither the government nor the project supported poultry
    vaccination, in view of the disappointing results found elsewhere and the large
    outlay of human and physical resources required. However, in June 2012,
    government decided to allow limited vaccination without project support on
    selected, large-scale commercial farms using approved H5N1 vaccines in two
    districts.

   Improving Biosecurity in Poultry Production and Trade. At MTR, the concept
    of piloting Biosecure Poultry Market Chains (BPMC) was introduced, in
    particular, to tackle weak farm biosecurity, which was identified as a major
    constraint to effective avian flu containment. The project established nine piloted
    BPMCs under PPP arrangements in nine high-risk upazilas. These BPMCs
    comprise nine new LBMs, 18 broiler and layer demonstration farms, 324
    participating poultry farmers, 90 middlemen/transporters and 180 LBM workers,
    and 1,260 poultry chain stakeholders trained in biosecurity. An estimated 15,500
    consumers are benefiting from buying safe, clean poultry meat from these nine
    market chains.

   Support for Surveillance of Migratory Birds. Inadequate attention paid to wild
    bird surveillance during the lifetime of the project has not helped to resolve the
    contributing factors to the endemic status of HPAI in Bangladesh. Targeted
    surveillance and the reporting of unusual wild bird die offs from HPAI was not
    implemented due to the refusal by the Department of Forestry to cooperate as it
    could not be brought around to support this activity which it viewed as out of its
    mandate. Subsequently, the US Geological Survey, in coordination with FAO and

                                        10
         the ICDDR, B, conducted a wild bird survey in 2011. Aside from this survey, no
         organized wild bird monitoring took place. Media reports mentioned migrating
         birds (crow) die-offs during the second outbreak wave (September 2007-May
         2008) and during the fourth 2009-2010 outbreak wave in the Dhaka region. In
         2011, crows infected with a new variant of the virus (clade 2.3.2.1) were
         identified, which may lead to the belief that the entrenchment of the disease could
         be caused by migratory wild birds.
          

        Establishing a Contingency Fund. This fund comprised allocations for
         compensation and emergency supplies (PPE), and was reduced at MTR from
         US$3.265 million to US$1.746 million by cancelling funds allocated for PPE, in
         view of the substantial amounts of PPE provided by donors.15 The compensation
         strategy was in place at project onset and was revised three times (June 2008,
         January 2011 and April 2011). A total of US$3.88 million was paid in
         compensation to 822 farmers for 2.58 million birds and 2.97 million eggs that
         were culled or destroyed (Annex 2). changes in 2011 to reflect compensation rates
         for culled poultry at the prevailing market prices resulted in an overall increase in
         pay-out per bird culled from US$1.28/bird in the pre-2011 period to US$1.80/bird
         from 2011 onwards, i.e., an overall increase of 41 percent. Further analysis
         showed that overall average compensation rates (US$1.42/commercial chicken vs.
         US$1.46/backyard chicken) were pro-poor and equitable in that sense. Also,
         traceable payments were reportedly made within four weeks from date of culling.
         Although disbursement of compensation was temporarily halted between
         November 2011 and April 2012, due to untimely release of counterpart funding
         by GoB, the entire scheme is considered to have been conducted in a responsive,
         pro-poor, equitable, transparent, and timely manner.

2.2.5 Component II: Public Awareness and Information. Overall implementation of
this component was rated Satisfactory. Although implementation started well behind
schedule, substantial progress was made in the final 14 months of the project. The
National Communication Strategy (drafted by UNICEF with JICA funding) was revised
and published in September 2010, and a second KAP survey was conducted that same
month. In October 2011, DLS signed the MOU with the Department of Mass
Communications (DMC) and took over the public awareness and risk communication
activities. This activity was assisted by FAO/TAS and the Technical Task Force on
Communication led by the CVO and assisted by IECDR. DMC made remarkable
progress in conducting mini campaigns in 20 upazilas in 20 districts using film shows,
folk songs, school programs, distribution of leaflets, posters and banners, deploying DLS
and other MOI staff trained under the project.


15
   MTR Aide Memoire, August 2009. Annexes V and VI. USAID donated PPE & disinfectants before
project onset, again in 2012 when it supplied 5,100 kg of disinfectant, 10,000 isolation gowns, 21,000
gloves, 50,000 facemasks, and 500 aprons. Emergency supplies delivered by project: 4,500, 1 of D4 Plus
and 1,500 kg of Vikron-S disinfectants to 52 upazilas


                                                 11
      Advocacy and Collaboration with Stakeholders. A total of 22,488 persons
       (equivalent to 23,056 person-days) received training and/or attended workshops
       on communications strategies and delivery, held in 20 high-risk districts across
       the country. Trainees included 568 DLS and other MOFL staff, 120 news media
       reporters, and 11,800 poultry farmers attended workshops. The KAP survey
       (2012) reports that 80 percent of targeted journalists accept good reporting
       practices, while respectively 90 percent and 70 percent of surveyed commercial
       and backyard poultry farmers are aware of and adopt good biosecurity practices.
       However, the high proportion (84 percent of total) of HPAI outbreaks involving
       commercial farms indicates a disconnect between the KAP and practice as
       evidenced by persisting weak biosecurity in that sector and is a source of concern.

      Production and Dissemination of Communication Materials. An advertising
       agency, contracted in December 2011, produced an assortment of
       communications and information materials, which were distributed across the
       country. These included 10 roadside billboards, 100 banners, 10,000 festoons,
       100,000 leaflets and 4-page booklets, 50,000 picture cards for schoolchildren,
       2,000 flipcharts, 200,000 booklets, and 3 videos on LBM and poultry farm
       biosecurity, and on general biosafety for consumers. These materials were
       distributed to schools, project-supported trainees, shops and malls, government
       departments, TV stations, farmers, LBMs, wet markets, and consumers. There
       was a reported increase in awareness of risks associated with HPAI among 80
       percent and 65 percent of targeted poultry consumers and processors (KAP survey,
       2012).

      Developing Community-based Communication Pilots. In one-day workshops,
       ten-thousand workers were trained in community-based awareness and
       communications to support “pilot? formation of a feedback mechanism to
       facilitate the flow of information from the grassroots level to project management
       and stakeholders. At the same time, the preparation and dissemination of
       information materials to the workers was monitored. There was no information or
       reporting at EoP to follow up on forming community-based groups.

2.2.6 Component III: Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation
The overall implementation of this component was rated Moderately Satisfactory, in view
of the delayed arrival of the FAO/TAS team and the institutional capacity weaknesses of
the DLS.

      Implementation Support. The initial limited human capacity of the PCU,
       established under DLS, resulted in slow implementation progress. However, with
       the arrival of the FAO/TAO team experts, implementation speed and quality
       improved due to PCU staff training and the recruitment of capable financial
       management and M&E staff. The reorganization plan prepared by PCU in
       response to the OIE self-evaluation exercise provided a major impetus to improve
       not only the quality of project implementation but also the management of

                                           12
         ongoing DLS programs. This included improved coordination between DLS, the
         FDIL, and SMS Gateway information flows, supported by the newly established
         Epidemiology Unit and the computerized LDIS network. The commitment by
         DLS to internalize the budgets associated with these new activities will ensure
         sustainability. Although late in arrival, the FAO/TAS team performed
         progressively well and has provided broad-based support to the PCU and DLS.

        Monitoring and Evaluation. A comprehensive Management Information System
         (MIS) and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) capacity was not set up until after
         the arrival of the FAO/TAS Team in October 2010. Although this design worked
         well during the remaining project life, the delay significantly hampered the
         project team’s response to intervene in implementation problems. Once the M&E
         design was in place, however, the Team within a space of two years implemented
         the M&E (financial management and reporting, program reporting, Quarterly
         Progress Reports) to compile data on BPMC, FDIL renovations, SMS Gateway
         and compliment the baseline survey. This sub-component provided financial and
         technical support for an international M&E expert16 responsible for the internal
         monitoring and evaluation of AIPRP and for periodic independent evaluation. A
         contracted external M&E firm collected data from 17 districts in six divisions to
         produce a KAP survey on training and public awareness, and completed baseline
         and impact assessment reports published in August 2012. The utilization of the
         M&E system contributed to improved identification of problems; especially of
         lagging farm biosecurity and farm monitoring; a principal factor in the continuing
         avian flu outbreaks.

2.3 Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance
2.3.1 Environmental Safeguard. Considering the nature and magnitude of
environmental impacts of the activities financed under the project, AIPRP was classified
as category ‘B’ project and only the World Bank Policy on Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP 4.01) has been triggered. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was
prepared to address potentially adverse environmental impacts and guide project
implementation, especially regarding safe culling, safe disposal of carcasses and
biosafety at FDILs, and biosecurity at LBMs and the pilot BPMC facilities. A Bio-safety
consultant hired by FAO worked closely with the project team for a certain period. The
July to December 201217 review of existing environmental safeguard and biosafety of the
above facilities indicates that structural and operational biosecurity improved
substantially after project intervention. Yet, there remains room for improvement,
particularly of dead bird disposal practices at the LBMs, and biosafety practices in the
FDILs, e.g., scientific disposal of postmortem and laboratory wastes, personal and




16
   The M&E expert arrived three years following the request by GoB for long-term FAO assistance, after which time a
baseline was prepared, and PCU implementation capacity and M&E began to improve.
17
   A National Consultant on Environment and Biosecurity was engaged by the FAO/TAs team to Review existing
environmental safeguard and biosafety of FDILs, Live Bird Market and demonstration and adapter farms (linked to the
nine pilot BPMC) in July 2012.

                                                        13
laboratory hygiene practices. The compliance to environmental assessment was rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

2.3.2 Fiduciary Compliance. At appraisal, Financial Management (FM) risk was rated
Substantial, with mitigation measures in place that made the residual risk as Modest. An
unique control framework, very specific to this project, outlining major expenditure
eligibility and indicators of fraud, corruption, collusion, and coercion was agreed at
project startup, which contributed to bring down the risk from S to M. In addition,
operational guidelines for accessing to the compensation fund were developed. FM
supervision reports indicate whether due procedures outlined in the Compensation
Payment Guidelines were followed for payments made at various levels. To ensure
appropriate controls in poultry culling and use of the compensation fund, project
activities include extensive training, workshops, awareness programs, and oversight.
Given initially low capacity for financial management within the PCU, the project
assisted in building the necessary capacity from the beginning, which led to a Satisfactory
rating for financial management. Project Audit reports were timely with major issues.
The project has maintained the timeline for submission of financial reports which were
reviewed in a timely manner.

The overall rating for borrower procurement is “Moderately Unsatisfactory? which is
mainly contributed by weak procurement capacity of DLS and consistent delays in
processing procurement activities, particularly in case of civil works and equipment for
laboratories. There were regular Procurement Post Reviews (PPR) of this project. In
FY12 PPR, three contracts amounting to $320,902 were found with significant deviations
and are being considered for mis-procurement. The major deviations were accepting
inferior quality goods by DLS compared to contract specifications, and not conducting
proper due diligence by the Tender Evaluation Committee. After the FY12 PPR, a set of
mitigation / improvement measures have been agreed between the Bank and DLS. The
implementing agency took proactive actions on some of these measures including
debarment of concerned suppliers, removal of Project Director, etc. However, in FY13
PPR a couple of contracts with major deviations were found which need further
investigation. It is to be noted that all these contracts were signed before finalization and
sharing of the FY12 PPR report to DLS and hence the improvement measures were not
applicable to these contracts.

2.4 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
2.4.1 At EOP, evidence indicates animal and public health services capacities to contain
HPAI outbreaks have become increasingly effective, technical and scientific support have
been enhanced and surveillance strengthened. Even though outbreaks continue, they are
quickly contained and diminishing in their occurrence pattern. However, with 1.5 percent
of the poultry population estimated to be sero-positive,18 the risk that HPAI outbreaks

  Information provided by the CVO during a meeting with the ICR team. A simple compartmental
Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model was used to analyze HPAI transmission in Bangladesh using the actual
outbreak data (2007-12). Results show an equilibrium prevalence rate of 1.46% (+ or – 0.05%) for the

                                                 14
may increase again cannot be ruled out. In addition, other emerging and re-emerging
transboundary zoonotic diseases might pose a threat in the future. In a post-completion
report prepared by DLS and FAO/TAS, the need to sustain reforms and institutional
capacity developed by the project is presented, based on the platform from which
surveillance, diagnosis, and communication can be further strengthened. MOFL needs to
(i) complete the reorganization of DLS and streamline the disease information exchange
between BLRI, the FDILs, and DLS;19 (ii) internalize and expand the operation of the
SMS Gateway surveillance system and the LDIS to include all livestock species;20 (iii)
build further diagnostic laboratory capacity to cover other priority livestock and zoonotic
diseases; (iv) build risk-based epidemiology capacity within the newly established
Epidemiology Unit (EpiU); (v) and ensure that all nine pilot BPMCs reach full
functionality and greatly expand their geographical scope. Public awareness for the
BPMCs should continue through PPP arrangements with commercial poultry industry
players, who would support part of the cost.

2.4.2 Awareness is increasing of the need to link HPAI and all animal-borne diseases
with the human and environment interface. Preliminary discussions concerning the
feasibility of a One Health operation in Bangladesh have been initiated. It is apparent in
Bangladesh that ancient diseases (anthrax, TB, rabies), newly emerging zoonotic disease
incidence (Nipah encephalitis), and economically important transboundary livestock
diseases (Peste des Petits Ruminants, Foot and Mouth Disease, New Castle Disease) are
increasing. The demand-driven, tripartite, inter-ministerial (MOFL, MOI and MOHFW)
collaboration, fostered under AIPRP, the strengthened BLRI, and the SMS Gateway
surveillance system all provide the necessary requirements for a solid platform to launch
such a One Health initiative.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Project Objectives, Design, and Implementation
The PDO, project design, and implementation of AIPRP were highly relevant and in
harmony with the 2006-2009 and 2011-2014 CAS supporting activities relevant to the
HPAI threat, such as public-private partnerships and financial sustainability in setting up
the integrate biosecure poultry marketing chains, strengthening public health through
addressing the HPAI threat, and strengthening risk mitigation in a country prone to
natural and health-related disasters. When avian influenza struck Bangladesh in early
2007, the veterinary services system was clearly unprepared to act as first responder. The
DLS was chronically understaffed and underfunded, and with the exception of BLRI, the
country had no human or physical capacity to rapidly and accurately diagnose and
characterize the disease. Surveillance was passive and sporadic, and field mobility
limited. There were no agencies to adequately carry out public awareness, and inter-
agency technical communications and disease data sharing within MOFL and between



scenario where time from reporting to culling is 1.5 days coupled with delayed restocking of 90 days
(Annex 3). This agrees with the estimated 1.5% HPAI sero-positive status estimated by the DLS survey.
19
   See Annex 2 for details.
20
   DLS/CVO indicated that plans were underway in December 2012 to absorb the SMS Gateway workers
into the system for a period of up to six months following end of project.

                                                 15
MOFL and MOH were rudimentary. There was very little coordination between poultry
sector organizations and the government, while weak poultry farm biosecurity prevailed.
The project design addressed all of these deficiencies, based on the NAIP policy
document that governed GoB’s institutional and technical activities, in line with FAO,
WHO, OIE guidelines, and the GPAI framework.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
3.2.1 The achievement of the PDO was Moderately Satisfactory, based on the
achievement of the three key PDO indicators (1a, 1b, and 2 in the Results Framework)
and a majority of the listed 23 intermediate outcome indicators; though weak farm
biosecurity persists, the epidemiological impacts of wild migratory birds are ignored and
the country is rated as HPAI endemic. Project implementation to achieve PDO was
shared among too many agencies complicating assessment and attribution of success. In
some cases, e.g., the SMS Gateway system, the project took over from other agencies.
The Key Performance Indicators were threefold:

3.2.2 (i) Evidence of improved effectiveness of animal and public health services to
an HPAI outbreak and/or pandemic; National Plan prepared and accepted by FAO,
WHO and OIE. Final Status: Operational Manuals were prepared in conformity with
FAO and OIE guidelines to provide implementation support. Evidence of key outcomes
in support of this achievement include: improved diagnostic laboratory capacity to
diagnose HPAI; greatly expanded active surveillance in all high-risk areas; improved
public awareness of consumer protection against avian flu; and the onset of an integrated
approach to biosecurity along the poultry marketing chain.

3.2.3 (ii) Evidence of improved effectiveness of animal and public health services
to an HPAI outbreak and/or pandemic; contained and diminishing pattern of HPAI
infection in poultry. Final Status: Evidence on the ground suggests that animal/public
health services to contain HPAI outbreaks are being effective, as measured by  significant
reductions in the number of outbreaks (21 outbreaks in 2012, the lowest since 2007) and
in outbreak-to-reporting-to-culling times (reduced from 4.8 days to 1.4 days), improved
pandemic preparedness in terms of isolation capacity at hospital and public facilities, the
monitoring of respiratory disease, and the implementation of joint medical-veterinary
containment campaigns to confine outbreaks (tested during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic).
Although outbreaks continue, they have not surpassed the 2008 peak and are now rapidly
contained. No human fatalities have occurred, although six human cases have been
identified. Public awareness is high; 96 percent of consumers surveyed knew how to
protect themselves against avian flu (KAP survey 2010).

3.2.4 (iii) Development of the NAIP to provide the institutional and logistic
framework for countering the avian flu threat. Final Status: The NAIP was revised
and updated to 2016 by the country’s animal and human health services. It conforms to
international guidelines, was formally approved by GoB, and became the policy used to
handle the avian flu crisis.



                                            16
3.3 Efficiency
3.3.1 Although not required for an emergency project, the Technical Annex has
included a financial and economic analysis. The economic analysis at appraisal, using a
Gross Attack Rate (GAR) scenarios model (0.7 percent of the poultry population being
affected), projected the impact of HPAI to range from losses of US$154 million or 0.3
percent of GDP to US$1.2 billion in the case of both severe human and poultry pandemic
(more than 2 percent of Bangladesh’s GDP). Between inception in 2007 and EoP in 2012,
2.58 million poultry or 1.7 percent of the poultry population were affected by the disease
(died or culled) – a worse scenario than that at appraisal which would have led to higher
economic losses at EoP.

3.3.2 Data available during project implementation—especially the outbreak data
collected by FAO/ECTAD in Bangladesh—enabled EoP analysis of the magnitude of the
economic losses (costs of the disease) and losses avoided as a result of the intervention
(benefits). The analysis models the project’s economic contribution as flowing from its
contribution to a reduction of the prevalence rate of the disease (days of infectiousness).
As a result of this reduction, fewer birds become ill, less mortality occurs and less culling
is required. In addition, risks to human health and other benefits arise, but are not
quantified and are excluded from the analysis. The reduction in the costs to the economy
of the disease with the project (which may still be substantial) compared to the costs of
the project is the relevant measure of project worth.

3.3.3 It is impossible to know with any certainty the stream of economic damages from
the disease in the without project situation. For the purposes of analysis, a stochastic
model was used to estimate the average cost of disease based on the average of 5,000
possible pathways of the disease over the six years (2007-2012) with the pre-project
prevalence rate (30.8%) as the starting point. The model’s average estimated the cost of
the disease at US$347 million. The project substantially contributed to reducing the
prevalence rate of the disease from 30.8% (given 5 days of infectiousness at project
inception) to 11.7% (given only 1.5 days of infectiousness at EoP). Based on this
reduction in prevalence of the disease, the stochastic model’s average estimate of the
costs of the disease over the same period fell from US$347 million to US$17 million.
This reduction in prevalence as a result of the intervention from the project and other
development partners, saved Bangladesh US$330 million which would have been
incurred had the higher pre-intervention level of prevalence prevailed. Less total
intervention costs of US$34.521 million, of which $12.3 million came from the project,
the net present value of the intervention is estimated at US$295.5 million, of which all




21
   Numerous agencies and development partners contributed money and materials to support various complimentary
aspects of the fight against the disease in Bangladesh culminating in the reduction of its prevalence. Specifically, AsDB
contributed US$0.5 million, UNICEF US$0.5, JICA US$1.0, DANIDA US$0.2 and USAID US$20 million making a
total of US$22.5 million in addition to direct project costs of US$12.3 million made up of IDA loan US$9.91, AHITF
US$1.17 and GoB US$1.25. In some cases, e.g. the SMS Gateway, the project took over activities from other agencies.


                                                           17
things being equal, about US$105.5 million can be attributed to the project, given that its
contribution represents 35.7% of the total cost of the intervention.

3.3.4 Additionally, it has to be considered that the investment has also, inter alia,
resulted in substantial improvements in surveillance and diagnostic capacities, assisted
the country to respond in timely manner to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, forged inter-
ministerial collaboration and created a platform for responding to other emerging
diseases. Overall, efficiency is rated as Satisfactory.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
3.4.1 PDO Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The project objectives were relevant.
However, the design was too complex with too many indicators for a small ERL project
given the limited capacity available in Bangladesh at its inception. The design also failed
to explicitly involve the DOF as an implementing agency concerned with wild bird
monitoring/surveillance. Nevertheless, project economic efficiency was satisfactory and
substantial progress made in building institutional technical and human resource capacity,
as evidenced by (i) a shift from passive to real-time active surveillance by the SMS
Gateway surveillance system which now covers 62 percent of upazilas,22 (ii) enhanced
diagnostic capacity at BLRI 23 and FDILs in diagnosing HPAI; (iii) 90 percent public
awareness and understanding of protection against avian flu; (iv) greatly improved
managerial and technical capacity of DLS, which will be further enhanced by its planned
reorganization; and (v) a commitment by MOFL to internalize sustainable budgets to
support the incremental capacity built. However, persisting weak farm biosecurity and
the failure of GoB, through DoF, to deal with wild migratory birds contributed to HPAI
endemicity and is a source of concern.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
3.5.1 Controlling HPAI at source in poultry has the expected outcome of mitigating
some of the socioeconomic impacts that would otherwise occur. In Bangladesh, poultry is
a source of livelihood and first point/step for investing in livestock for millions of poor
households, many of which are female-headed. At the commercial level, one million farm
workers are employed. By contributing significantly to the reduction of outbreaks, the
project has improved livelihoods, protecting investment and labor opportunities of poor
and non-poor workers. The compensation scheme was also pro-poor and equitable in
paying equal rates for commercial and indigenous poultry.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
3.5.2 The reorganization of DLS into a more functionally capable institutional entity,
the inclusion of a new epidemiology unit, the modernization and expansion of its disease
surveillance network and the upgrading of its veterinary laboratory system have been
very significant capacity building initiatives that will render DLS more capable to address


22
   Not all upazilas contain poultry and are therefore not being monitored. All of the high-risk upazilas,
together with upazilas holding large poultry populations, are being monitored.

national animal and zoonotic disease emergencies. The internalization of budgets to cover
enhanced institutional strengthening will ensure sustained capacity by DLS to address
HPAI and other priority diseases. The reorganization of DLS in accordance with the OIE
assessment report will contribute greatly to improved first responder capacity and the
control of other livestock diseases that hamper efficient production.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None reported.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
3.6.1 A mid-term and end-of-project KAP beneficiary surveys were conducted in 2010
and 2012, which reported the following key findings:
     Overall general awareness of HPAI was high (90 percent)
     For farmers, their sources of knowledge on HPAI were TV (35.1 percent),
       veterinary services (28.6 percent), medical representative (7.8 percent), local
       market (5.2 percent), radio, drug seller, neighbor/friend (3.9 percent each), poster
       and local leader (2.6 percent each), and other sources (6.5 percent)
     90 percent of surveyed commercial poultry farmers are aware of good biosecurity
       practices
     65 percent of targeted people handling poultry products (processors) are aware of
       hazards associated with HPAI
     70 percent of backyard poultry holders are aware of recommended biosecurity
       practices
     96 percent of surveyed consumers of poultry products are aware of hazard
       associated with HPAI (KAP 2010)

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
4.1      Rating: High
The risk of a pandemic attack threat that might result in a massive loss of human life
under a worst-case scenario was estimated as High at Appraisal, based on 663,000 human
fatalities (1 percent of the population) resulting from a Gross Attack Rate (GAR) by end
of project, and a 10 percent loss of national poultry inventory. Although the actual data
by EoP, based on surveillance and compensation results and humans affected, stood at 1
percent GAR for poultry and zero percent for human fatalities, the fact that HPAI is now
endemic in the country warrants serious consideration to launch a follow up project. Even
though the capacity to address outbreaks has vastly improved, poultry farm biosecurity
remains the weak link in containing outbreaks, and the internalization of surveillance,
continued public awareness, and further upgrading of laboratory diagnosis remain
essential. Given the continuing outbreaks and the declared endemicity of HPAI in the
country, the risk to development outcome must continue to be rated as High.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
Although designed as an emergency operation the project design was overly ambitious
and did not take into sufficient account the limited technical and managerial
implementation capacity of DLS. Implementation quality was further impacted by the
delayed technical assistance by FAO and the belated recognition that biosecurity along

                                            19
the poultry market chain was a main constraint in overcoming the continuing HPAI
outbreaks. These factors contributed to the MS ratings for overall Bank and Borrower
performance.

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
5.1.1 The project design followed the GPAI template and the Bank task team
incorporated lessons from other HPAI projects, identified and addressed key risks
associated with implementation especially developing sound fiduciary, financial
management and procurement structures. The team also elicited strong government
commitment and leadership, provided for implementation support from a FAO/TAS team
to address weaknesses in capacity among DLS and PCU staff, and coordinated donor-
supported inputs. However, the Bank should have insured that the project design for
emergency operations is simple and easy to implement, which was not in line with the
objectives of the implementation of emergency operation under OP/BP 8.50, and the
GPAI template format which was designed to simplify project design and thereby speed
implementation. The complexity of the numerous sub-components and the long period
between the concept note and appraisal and approval do not fit the scope of an emergency
operation. In this respect, the Bank’s performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The Bank team was committed and made significant efforts in providing day-to-day
support to DLS and PCU staff pending the arrival of the FOA/TAS team. The Bank team
strongly reminded the GoB to complete the revision and approval of its Development
Project Performa (DPP) and to meet its other project commitments. The team also
mounted timely implementation support missions, including the MTR. Although the
MTR restructured the Financial Agreement of the project and introduced the BPMC
concept to tackle biosecurity, supervision failed to ensure full restructuring at MTR given
the scope of the impacts of the reduction in the project activities on some of its major
components. Bank supervision of environmental safeguard, financial management,
procurement and fiduciary compliance were equally satisfactory. With regard to
procurement which was one of the most critical weaknesses of the implementing agency,
regular post-procurement reviews were carried out and specific recommendations made
which have largely contributed to improving overall procurement management
performance (see section 2.3). Related to the non-participation of DOF in wild bird
monitoring, the Bank team should have worked out an alternative option to ensure that
this activity was effectively implemented. Based on the above, quality of supervision is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Based on the Moderately Unsatisfactory rating of Quality at Entry, a Moderately
Satisfactory rating for Quality of Supervision and a project outcome rating of Moderately
Satisfactory, overall Bank performance was rated Moderately Satisfactory. An overall

                                            20
rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory for Bank performance is plausible given that Quality
at Entry was Moderately Unsatisfactory and contributes to the weighting. However, the
Bank team did provide satisfactory support in a pragmatic and responsive manner for
project implementation and review, and consultant quality, especially during the project
implementation period prior to the arrival of the FAO/TAS Team. The Bank team
overcame significant challenges to turn around flagged implementation delays and guide
the project to achieve its PDOs with a Moderately Satisfactory rating. These weigh in
favor of an overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory for Bank performance.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
5.2.1 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. There was some evidence of commitment by
GoB to implement the project as an emergency operation e.g. approval of the transfer of
105 AVSs before the approval of the second RDPP, which is usually not allowed in non-
emergency projects; a positive response to the adjustment of AIPRP plan to include the
BPMC and lobbying DLS and other Government authorities to support it and to make it a
success. However, slow procurement due to the lengthy bureaucratic process in obtaining
multiple-level government clearances delayed implementation. The DLS procurement
team began operating more effectively following staff training and the contracting of
capable procurement officers. Nonetheless, more effort on the side of GoB was needed to
implement the project as an emergency operation, as intended under the implementation
arrangements of the Bank’s OP/BP8.50. The delays in signing agreements with DMC
resulted in significant delays in implementing Component II, even though excellent
progress was made after signing. The cancellation of IDA $4m in project activities during
the MTR review was initiated by GoB (see para. 2.2.2.). Some of these were the result of
duplication by other donors; others the result of less than anticipated requirements in
outbreak containment and biosecurity, which in retrospect of emerging needs, should not
have been reduced.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
5.2.2 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The initial rating of the implementing agency -
PCU under DLS - was overall Unsatisfactory with procurement rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory. This might have been as a result of its very low initial human resource
capacity, which only improved to Moderately Satisfactory following the arrival of the
FAO/TAS Team. Although the signing of the FAO Agreement to field a technical
assistance team to support DLS was seriously delayed, its performance contributed
greatly to the technical and managerial capacity, not only of the PCU but also of DLS.
Original signing was scheduled for March 31, 2009, but the TAS team did not arrive until
October 2010, 18 months after the scheduled arrival date. Although the performance of
the TAS team, once in the field, was rated Satisfactory, the delay by FAO headquarters in
organizing and fielding the Team was only Moderately Satisfactory. The three ratings for
PCU/DLS, FAO/TAS and FAO Headquarters combined, form the rationale for the
overall MS rating of the implementing agencies.




                                           21
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
5.2.3 Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. Although capacity to respond to HPAI outbreaks
have been very significantly strengthened, the performances of both the Government and
the Implementation Agency (FAO) were both Moderately Satisfactory justifying an
overall rating of Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
6.1    Project-specific:
     The project design and scope should have been simpler by better balancing
       technical content against the limited local implementation capacity and tailoring
       the design accordingly. There were too many complex indicators which over-
       burdened this relatively small project.
     Bank and Borrower implementation performance could have been substantially
       improved by a simpler project design, earlier institution of better M&E quality,
       better cognizance of matching project funds and activities to already ongoing
       donor activities, quicker government action to recruit partner organization, if
       necessary for project implementation, and speedy internalization of incremental
       budgets associated with upgraded avian flu containment activities.
     In particular and relating to Bank and donors’ approaches to emergency projects,
       it would be helpful during design and in spite of associated pressures to
       streamline and channel financing in ways that complement rather than duplicate
       each other’s effort. Care should be taken to explicitly include all relevant agencies
       as implementing partners. The case of DOF opting out of wild bird monitoring
       despite the importance of the exercise is in focus here.
     Inadequate poultry farm biosecurity is the paramount constraint in containing
       avian influenza in Bangladesh, which should have been recognized during project
       preparation. The PPP arrangements employed to include private sector poultry
       organizations (farms) and involved municipalities (LBMs) as major participants
       were instrumental in achieving broad cooperation.
     Public awareness messaging is expensive and should be shifted from sole
       government financing to PPP arrangements with private sector business
       stakeholders, under which the costs of circulating messages is borne as part of the
       goodwill advertising by businesses (i.e., poultry feed and drug companies, breeder
       farms and hatcheries).
     Risk-based epidemiology capacity should be developed quickly, so that the costs
       of disease control strategies becomes focused on the least-cost analysis of high-
       risk areas, thereby limiting human physical resource costs whilst making
       interventions more effective and sustainable.
     Speeding up procurement in HPAI emergency operations implemented under
       GAIP needs full readiness for implementation prior to negotiation, greater
       Borrower cooperation, and more intensive PCU training.

6.2       General:
         Limit the “sticker shock? of incremental operating and maintenance costs from
          upgraded laboratory and surveillance systems by a gradual, proportional shift

                                            22
       from project to government funding during the project’s lifespan, leading to full
       government financing by end of project.
      Emergency operations must be implemented as such. Avian flu is a rapidly
       spreading infection; a slow response will increase the risk of endemicity.

Component I - Animal Health

1.      Component I Animal Health This component strengthened the legal framework
to address avian influenza by revising the NAIP; strengthened disease surveillance by
intensive training and supporting the SMS Gateway active surveillance system; renovated
seven diagnostic laboratories and constructed two new ones; and provided equipment to
the CDIL-NAI. The component also supported the establishment of nine biosecure
marketing poultry chains, and established a contingency fund to cover compensation,
PPE, and the financing of unforeseen events. FAO was contracted to provide technical
assistance to DLS.

2.     Subcomponent I.A - Enhancing Prevention and Preparedness Capability.
The 2006-2008 National Avian Influenza Control Plan (NAIP) was adopted and
published, and was updated to cover the period 2009-2016 to reflect new priorities related
                                                   27
to strengthening surveillance, increase awareness and risk communication training,
focusing on backyard poultry, improving farm biosecurity, and supporting applied
research into avian influenza, and strengthening the operations of BLRI and its National
Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. The OIE completed its review of national
veterinary services in October 2011. Based on the review, DLS prepared a reorganization
plan that would (i) internalize budget to support the upgraded surveillance provided by
the SMS Gateway System; (ii) expand the Livestock Disease System to monitor all
livestock species; (iii) support the newly established epidemiology unit; (iv) support the
full staffing, training and operations of the renovated FDILs; (iv) and streamline disease
information flows between the FDILs, BLRI, CDIL, and DLS. Under the reorganization,
the existing Director of Research, Evaluation and Training in charge of CDIL and the
FDILs would be replaced by a Director of Disease Investigation and Epidemiology
(DDIE). The DDIE will oversee three entities: (i) the Central Disease Investigation
Laboratory (CDIL) and its divisions; (ii) the FDILs; and (iii) the new Epidemiology Unit.
The proposed reorganization (Table 1) would greatly improve the disease information
flow, disease investigation, and diagnostic services. 




 
3.      Subcomponent I.B - Strengthening Disease Surveillance and Diagnostic
Capacity. Legislation was passed to strengthen the veterinary services framework. The
animal health information flow was improved in several ways; (i) a reduction of outbreak
detection to culling time from 4.8 days to 1.4 days; (ii) commercial poultry farms across
the country, including their poultry inventories, were registered and geo-positioned,
which allows for the rapid identification of infected farms; (iii)the 306 high-risk upazilas
receive priority monitoring by 1,006 SMS Gateway workers; and (iv) inter-agency
meetings on the technical aspects of the status of HPAI, chaired by the Chief Veterinary
Officer, the PCU, FAO/TAS team, and participating donors, have improved; and (v)
community-based surveillance was established, linked to the SMS Gateway system.

4.      Surveillance. The SMS Gateway system provides real-time avian flu outbreak
information via cellphones from GPS-located farms by electronic transmission to the
Epidemiology Unit (EpiU). The system has reduced outbreak response time between
reporting and culling from 4.8 to 1.4 days. Over 86 percent of outbreaks are now covered
by the SMS Gateway, compared to 14 percent passively reported cases by farmers. The
system needs to more closely monitor backyard poultry farms, since the 88 percent of all
outbreaks reported on commercial farms may signal a lack of accurate information from
the more difficult to monitor non-commercial (backyard) farms and household flocks. A
total of 21,888 poultry farmers, animal health workers, and veterinary staff involved at
the supervisory and field investigation levels of surveillance were trained. Details of

5.      Laboratory Capacity. The diagnostic capacity of the veterinary diagnostic
laboratory system was substantially strengthened. At project onset, FDIL staffing was
only 30 percent of required level and improved to 63 percent by EoP. Further staff
recruitment is in progress. Details up to EoP are presented in Table 3.

Even though the staffing rates of 70 percent for Scientific Officers and Laboratory
Attendants show good progress in recruitment, the recruitment of laboratory technicians
needs further improvement, as these are the workers directly involved in conducting the
avian flu and other diagnostic tests.26 A total of 72 FDIL, CDIL and Veterinary Hospital
laboratory staff, 100 percent of permanent and deputant staff were trained in avian flu
diagnostics (Table 4). However, more training will be required to ensure that FDIL
technicians are familiar with at least three of the six diagnostic tests for HPAI, as
recommend by OIE. Tests related to nuclear characterization will be performed at NDIL
or at BLRI/NRL-AI.



26
  These tests are Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), Hemagglutination (HA), Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI),
Agar Gel Immunodiffusion (AGID), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and Serum
Neutralization (SN), of which the first three should be performed by FDIL technicians.

6.      Seven existing FDILs were renovated and two new FDILs were constructed.27
Support to the national laboratories to enhance national capacity for disease diagnosis
resulted in completion of the renovation and provision of supplies and equipment to the
seven FDILs. Renovations of the existing FDILs were completed in May 2011, and they
have attained full functionality. The delivery of HPAI-dedicated diagnostic equipment,
chemicals and consumables (i.e., Rapid Test field kits) to all FDILs was conducted upon
the completion of their renovations, which required a phased laboratory staff training
program for each FDIL, using their own equipment, consumables and renewed facilities.
Although the targeted delivery of 75 percent of emergency supplies (PPE, disinfectants
and sprayers) by June 2011 was achieved, the delivery of laboratory equipment and
furniture to the new FDIL laboratories under construction in Jessore and Chittagong has
been delayed as a result of slow procurement. The National Reference Laboratory-Avian
Influenza (NRL-AI), located at BLRI, received two BSL-3 cabinets to improve the
biosafety of laboratory workers.

7.      The capacity of FDILs to conduct basic HPAI tests remains confined to two HPAI
tests recommended by OIE for that level of laboratory. However, the Avian Influenza
Reference Laboratory under BLRI is fully capable of conducting all 12 OIE-
recommended tests, and carries most of the diagnostic load. An assessment of FDIL
laboratory training indicated that of the six common HPAI tests recommended by OIE,
FDIL staff were able to perform the two or three tests that define the H antigen of the
H5N1 virus, with BLRI/HRL-AI performing the more complicated nucleotide tests; the
accuracy of which proved to be over 90 percent compatible with dual tests performed by
the International Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory in Padova, Italy. Renovations,
instrumentation and training have been completed at BLRI and at the seven existing
FDILs, although construction of the two new FDILs (Jessore and Chittagong) was
significantly delayed.28



27
   Renovated FDILs are located in Manikgonj, Barisal, Joyputhat, Feni, Sirajgonj, Gaibandha and Sylhet.
New FDILs were constructed in Jessore and Chitagong.
28
   Construction at FDIL Jessore was delayed as the result of heavy monsoon rains. Proposals for a new
FDIL in Chittagong were received late in the project lifespan.

                                                                          30
8.      The project initially earmarked funds for DLS staff to undertake collaborative
applied research into HPAI by issuing competitive grants to veterinary colleges and
faculties. The PCU received at least ten proposals under the auspices of the Bangladesh
Agriculture University (BAU) at Mymensingh, BLRI, DLS and Chittagong Veterinary
and the Animal Science University (CVASU). However, there is no indication that this
competitive grant scheme materialized during the project.

9.     Subcomponent I.C - Strengthening Control Programs and Containment
Plans. The targeting of HPAI virus elimination at source comprised the principal NAIP
containment policy to contain HPAI virus, and was addressed by the establishment of
rapid response teams. With initial assistance from Sweden, later continued by USAID
and taken over by the project on October 2010, DLS used the SMS Gateway system for
the rapid detection of outbreaks and fielding rapid response teams to cull sick and in-
contact poultry. By EoP, the project supported the monitoring of 306 high-risk upazilas,
employing 102 trained VOs and AVSs and 1,015 trained AIWs, using SMS messaging,
supervised by 50 UVSs. By EoP, 550 outbreaks had been identified and contained,
comprising the culling of 2.3 million poultry. 29 Although this system worked well,
seasonal outbreaks have continued, primarily as the result of continuing weak farm
biosecurity. The estimated monthly cost of full surveillance and containment amounts to
$200,000, and options to support this cost following EoP include: monitoring
documented high-risk upazilas, whilst further strengthening poultry farm biosecurity.

10.     DLS, supported by FAO/ECTAD, established twelve roadside checkpoints to
monitor poultry movements across the country along with the monitoring and
disinfection of live bird markets. Neither the government nor the project supported
poultry vaccination, in view of the unsubstantiated results found elsewhere, and the
insupportable human and physical resources required. However, as the result of heavy
pressure by the poultry industry, in June 2012 the government allowed limited
vaccination on selected, large-scale commercial farms using approved H5N1 vaccines in
two districts, implemented without project support.

11.    Subcomponent I.D - Improving Biosecurity in Poultry Production and Trade.
The project established nine piloted biosecure poultry market chains (BPMC) in nine
high-risk upazilas. The nine BPMCs comprise nine new LBMs, 18 broiler and layer
demo farms, 324 participating poultry farmers, 90 middlemen/transporters, and 180 LBM
workers; 1,260 poultry chain stakeholders were trained in biosecurity. When fully
operational, an estimated 15,500 consumers will benefit from buying safe, clean poultry
meat from these nine market chains. Each LBM has separate delivery, sales and slaughter
areas, with one-way flows of consumers.

12.    Financing was achieved through public-private partnerships between Level 2 and
3 participating lead poultry farmers, LBMs, poultry transporters, and municipal
marketing committees, in which most of the LBMs are located. The project supplied
matching grants for the upgrading of participating farms, program, mobilization,

participant training, and LBM renovations. All participants have committed themselves to
purchase, transport and slaughter poultry from within each chain, and adhere to a set of
regulations. An estimated 15,500 consumers will benefit from safe, hygienically prepared
poultry meat supplied by the chains. A total of US$315,000 in matching project funds
was allocated for the mobilization, training, construction and supervision of the BPMC
pilot. Construction work was of high quality at all locations, except the demonstration
farm at Nilfamari, which was rejected. As a result, only eight of the nine BPMCs were
completed and operational at EoP.

13.     Subcomponent I.E - Support for Surveillance of Migratory Birds. Targeted
surveillance and the reporting of unusual wild bird die-offs from HPAI was not
implemented due to the Department of Forestry’s refusal to cooperate as it saw this task
as outside its mandate. Subsequently, the US Geological Society, in coordination with
FAO and the ICDDR, B, conducted a wild bird survey in 2011.


14.    Subcomponent I.F - Establish a Contingency Fund for Compensation and
PPE. Compensation paid from all sources for destroyed poultry and eggs was $3.88
million, of which the project’s contribution was $0.83 million, with $3.05 million from
GoB (Table 1). The project’s compensation funds were paid out over the period FY2007-
2008, with GoB paying compensation paid out for the periods FY2006 and FY2008-
2012.

Payments were made to 822 claimants for a total of 2.58 million poultry and 2.97 million
eggs (Table 2). Compensation was paid within four weeks of claims received. The
cleaning and disinfection of affected places became a pre-condition for payment of
compensation to commercial farmers. The predominance of commercial over backyard
claims did not reflect a failure to disproportionally compensate commercial claimants, but
rather the predominance of outbreaks on commercial operations and their larger number
of poultry and eggs culled. The ratio of the amount of compensation paid and the number
of poultry covered is rather similar: 1.42 for all poultry, 1.42 for commercial, and 1.46 for
backyard poultry (Table 3). This indicates that amounts paid, based on ongoing
compensation prices for culled poultry, were similar for backyard as well as commercial
poultry, with the only difference to composition of claim comprising different classes of
poultry.

16.    The project disbursed all of its contingency funds to cover the cost of paying
compensation. At MTR, these funds, which included the purchase of PPE and H5N1
vaccines, were reduced from $3.2565 million to $1.746 million, based on the rationale
that donors were already providing substantial amounts of PPE and disinfectants, and that
GoB had decided not to use poultry vaccination as an HPAI control strategy.


Component II: Public Awareness and Information.

17.   This component was designed to improve public awareness and information about
HPAI to safeguard the human health of the general public, extension staff, animal health
                                                      33
workers, poultry producers, poultry traders, poultry processors, and other stakeholders
dealing with poultry. Although the implementation of this component started behind
schedule, substantial progress was made in the remaining 14 months of project lifespan.
Outputs comprised human resource development as well as the distribution of multi-
media messages and information on avian influenza.

18.     Subcomponent II.A - Advocacy and Collaboration with Stakeholders. A total
of 22,488 persons (equivalent to 23,056 person-days) received training and/or attended
workshops on communications strategies and delivery, held in 20 high-risk districts
across the country. Trainees included 568 DLS and other MOFL staff, 120 news media
reporters, and 11,800 poultry farmers attending workshops (Table 5).

19.    Subcomponent II.B - Production and Dissemination of Communication
Materials. An advertising agency, contracted in December 2011, produced an assortment
of communications and information materials, which were distributed across the country.
These included 10 roadside billboards, 100 banners, 10,000 festoons, 100,000 leaflets and
4-page booklets, 50,000 picture cards for school children, 2,000 flipcharts, 200,000
booklets, and 3 videos on LBM and poultry farm biosecurity, and on general biosafety for
consumers. These materials were distributed to schools, project-supported trainees, shops
and malls, government departments, TV stations, farmers, LBMs, wet markets and
consumers.

20.    Subcomponent II.C - Developing Community-based Pilots. Ten-thousand
workers were trained in one-day workshops in community-based awareness and
communications (Table 5). This activity was designed to support “pilot? formation of the
community-based communication groups and provide a feedback mechanism to facilitate
the flow of information from the grassroots level to project management and
stakeholders. The groups were to monitor the preparation and dissemination of
information materials but there was no evidence of their formation or activity at EoP.

Component III: Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation

21.    Subcomponent III.A - Implementation and Support by the PCU and
FAO/TAS teams. The initial human capacity weakness of the PCU established under
DLS resulted in slow implementation, which contributed to the Moderately
Unsatisfactory ISR ratings of March and July 2009. However, with the arrival of the

                                                                   34
FAO/TAS team experts, these ratings improved to Satisfactory as the result of PCU staff
training and the recruitment of capable financial management and M&E staff. The
reorganization plan prepared by PCU in response to the OIE self-evaluation exercise
provided a major impetus to improve not only the quality of project implementation but
also the management of ongoing DLS programs. This included improved coordination
between DLS and the FDIL and SMS Gateway information flows, supported by the
newly established Epidemiology Unit and the computerized LDIS network. The
commitment by DLS to internalize the budgets associated with these new activities will
ensure sustainability.

22.     Although late in arrival, the FAO/TAS team has performed well and has provided
broad-based support to the PCU and DLS. Outputs include the design of the BPMC pilot,
training and technical support provision to DLS and PCU staff, and to civil society;
assistance in the implementation of Component II activities, an evaluation of the
biosecurity status of Bangladeshi LBMs, and close collaboration with other assistance
agencies involved in avian flu control.

23.    Procurement, although often slow as the result of multiple government clearances
beyond the responsibility of the PCU, proceeded within Bank guidelines, as did financial
management, as evidenced by the non-qualified status of all external audits conducted.
Reports and other required project documentation were provided in a timely fashion. The
issuance of the environmental management report and the arrival of an EM consultant
were delayed, but poultry culling operations, field worker and laboratory worker
biosafety were conducted under acceptable conditions.

24.     Subcomponent III.B - Monitoring and Evaluation. This sub-component
provided financial and technical support for an international M&E expert,30 responsible
for the internal monitoring and evaluation of AIPRP and for periodic independent
evaluation. M&E will be part of the Management Information System (MIS) that will be
established in the PCU.




30
  The M&E expert arrived three years after the GoB’s request for long-term FAO assistance. A baseline
was prepared, and PCU implementation capacity and M&E began to improve.

Annex 2a: National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza (NRL-
AI), present status and future requirements

Background: When the National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza (NRL-AI) in
BLRI diagnosed the first case of HPAI in Bangladesh, it did so with basic equipment (a
biosafety cabinet and conventional PCR donated by JICA. The capacity for diagnosis was
very poor. Assistance from AIPRP started in 2009, and by 2010, the NRL-AI was
upgraded to BSL-2 level and diagnostic equipment, supplied by the Project, DANIDA
and JICA, was installed. The laboratory now has a capacity for the molecular diagnosis of
HPAI through conventional and real-time PCR (RT-PCR), using conventional as well as
quantitative PCR systems and gene sequencing. Furthermore, NRL-AI has capacity to
carry out ELISA, HI, HA, AGPT, and virus culture in embryonated eggs, and primary as
well as continuous tissue cell lines, even though the laboratory is understaffed and has
difficulty fulfilling the national demand for advanced diagnostic with its limited work
force.

Achievements: The NRL-AI conducted several research projects in the monitoring and
diagnosis of circulating avian influenza virus. Other than routine diagnostic activities, the
laboratory facilitated advanced studies and research on the following topics: (i)
identification of the risk factors for incursion and spread of HPAI; (ii) identification of
HPAI virus in wild migratory birds and domestic ducks; (iii) identification of two new
HPAI sub-clades (Clade 2.3.4 and 2.3.2.1), co-circulating with previously identified sub-
clade (Clade 2.2) by this laboratory; and (iv) identification of circulating low- and highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus in wild and domestic birds, which contributed to the
development of effective control strategies.

Network development and advanced studies support. NRL-AI is providing a platform
to promote the optimal utilization of the country’s laboratory networks. The laboratory
developed strong collaboration with the laboratories of ICDDR, B, Bangabandhu Sheikh
Mujib Medical University, the Jute Research Institute, the Biotechnology Institute, and
others. NRL-AI also supported research programs for MSc and PhD degree studies in
collaboration with the Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), Chittagong Veterinary
and Animal Sciences University (CVASU) and other organizations.

Knowledge dissemination: Since 2009, the NRL-AI has organized two hands-on
training programs per year for officers of the Central Disease Investigation Laboratory
(CDIL) and the Field Disease Investigation Laboratories (FDILs). NRL-AI also
conducted training on virus culture and detection for medical professionals from ICDDR,
B. With project support, NRL-AI also arranged a hands-on training program for DLS
officers, as well as lectures in training program arranged by other organizations.

Constraints and Conclusions: Aside from its limited workforce, the laboratory faces a
critical transportation problem, which hampers its field mobility in cases where a rapid
field response is needed. Additional vehicles and a mobile clinic for field operations will
be necessary to achieve this objective. The NRL-AI itself needs to be upgraded to the
BSL-3 level to allow it to work safely with highly infectious organisms. The laboratory’s

                                             36
long-range plans include its continuation as an important facilitator in avian influenza
control, especially in the areas of staff training, scientific liaison with other institutions,
improvements in laboratory management, advanced disease investigation, and the
monitoring of public and private sector disease investigation laboratories.

Diagnostic Accuracy Verification: Since 2007, 100 samples have been sent to the
Veterinary Laboratory Agency in Weybridge, UK and the International Avian Influenza
Laboratory in Padua, Italy for quality control comparison. Over 90 percent of diagnoses
were rated identical.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
The economic analysis at appraisal projected the impact of HPAI to range from losses of US$154
million or 0.3 percent of GDP in the case of 0.7 percent of the poultry population being affected,
to US$1.2 billion in the case of both severe human and poultry pandemic, which would be more
than 2 percent of Bangladesh’s GDP. For lack of relevant information, these were based on Gross
Attack Rate (GAR) scenarios. As more data became available during project implementation—
especially the outbreak data collected by FAO/ECTAD in Bangladesh—the data quality enabled
the use of epidemiologic-economic modeling.

On the epidemiology side, a simple compartmental Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model was used to
determine the transmission characteristics of the virus and estimate its prevalence in various
compartments (in this case district-by-district), as well as overall, depending on changes in the
major factors that affect transmission, e.g., infectious period (number of days between reporting
an outbreak and culling), restocking gap (time between culling/disinfecting premises and bringing
in new birds). Depending on combinations of factors (scenarios), equilibrium prevalence rates are
estimated for each scenario. Project interventions resulted in the reduction of infectious days from
5 days (or 30.8 percent prevalence) in 2007 to 1.5 day (or 11.69 percent prevalence) by 2009. The
analysis shows that a further reduction in prevalence rate was possible by combining a reduction
of the duration of infectiousness and delaying restocking by 90 days. If the project had combined
the 1.5 days achieved with 90 days delays in restocking, the equilibrium prevalence rate could
have been driven down to 1.46 percent by 200931.

On the economics side, a stochastic simulation model is used to combine the transmission
parameters from the epidemiologic model with production, productivity and price data to
generate a distribution (after 5,000 simulations) of the physical losses from mortality in egg
production.

The results show that in the scenario where infectious period was reduced from 5 days to 1.4
days.; Without intervention and with 5 days infectious period as starting point of 5,000 possible
disease pathways, the stochastic average of costs to Bangladesh amounted to nearly US$347
million (ranging from US$3 million to US$1,261 million) over six years. With reduction in
factious period from 5 days to 1.4 days the cost of the disease was reduced to US$17 million
saving Bangladesh US$330 million (ranging from US$0.1 million to US$1,248 million) over the
same period.

Details of the epidemiological and economic modeling are presented below.

The rate of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Bangladesh: In this analysis,
the transmission rate of the H5N1 HPAI virus between districts is quantified, focusing on a total
of 550 cases observed between 15 March 2007 and 5 April 2012 (the last outbreak).The
reproductive number of the disease as the product of the transmission rate and the duration of
infectiousness are also estimated.



31
  This and related results were not reported in the main text to focus the reader’s attention on the activities
implemented during the project rather than scenarios developed after the operations.




                                                      38
Analytical methods: It is assumed that H5N1 HPAI transmission can be represented through a
simple compartmental Susceptible-Infectious (SI) model, assuming that all newly infected
districts (C) are infected through indirect contact with infectious districts (I) during the same
wave of the epidemic. Contact between districts could occur via movement of migratory birds,
purchase and transport of poultry or transfer of infectious material (e.g., feces) via fomites from
infected to uninfected village (FAO, 2008). Representing the number of susceptible districts per
week as S, the number of infectious districts per week as I and the total number of districts as N,
                               ?SI
the number of C is given by        , where ? is the transmission rate parameter representing the
                                N
rate of transmission of H5N1 HPAI virus per effective contact.
                                        NC
The parameter ? is therefore given by       , and the reproductive number, Re is calculated as the
                                        SI
product of ? and T, the duration of infectiousness (Ward et al., 2009).

Transmission coefficients were estimated for each outbreak, as well as for the entire period
covered by the data. The fact that this pattern has been maintained over time suggests that the
virus is being maintained in the country, though the exact mechanisms involved in this
maintenance have not been identified.

and November 2012

Probability of an infection in a district: A compartmental Susceptible-Infectious model (SI) was
used to estimate the probability of a district getting infected based on the transmission parameters
estimated. The other assumptions made include: (i) The incubation period of the virus is three
days; (ii) Restocking of poultry after culling varies from 20 to 100 days. The overall and
outbreak-specific district-level transmission coefficients of H5N1 HPAI virus in Bangladesh,
based on the data collected between March 200 and April 2012 are outlined in Table 1.

Generally, the rate of transmission is higher for outbreaks 3 and 5 compared to those of the other
outbreaks. The estimated duration of infectiousness estimated for each of the three scenarios
given in Table 1 is: 7 days – 5.81 days (Standard deviation 9.02); 14 days – 9.36 days (SD 15.18);
and 21 days – 12.24 days (SD 17.58)

Mean duration of infectiousness: Further analysis of the mean duration of infectiousness by year
and phase of the outbreak, assuming a 21-day repeat infection, is demonstrated in Figure 2 and
Table 2. This analysis shows that this period was shorter in the 2009 and 2012 (or outbreaks 3
and 6) compared to the other years.

Predicted prevalence of H5N1 HPAI by district: The SI model explained above has been used to
explore basic scenarios of H5N1 HPAI prevalence in Bangladesh. Figure 3 shows the impact of
reducing the mean duration of infectiousness from 17 days second outbreak) to five days (sixth
outbreak). An additional scenario of two days is included to assess whether the disease could be
eliminated if the duration of infectiousness was substantially reduced.




                                                                    40
Figure 3. Impact of reducing the mean duration of           Figure 4. Predicted prevalence of H5N1 HPAI in
infectiousness of H5N1 HPAI on the prevalence of the        Bangladesh by district when the duration of
disease in Bangladesh                                       infectiousness is reduced, while simultaneously delaying
                                                            the period of restocking by 90 days

Figure 3 shows that the equilibrium prevalence of H5N1 HPAI declines with a reduction in the
mean duration of infectiousness. Prevalence rates associated with the mean durations defined in
the graph are 59.4 percent, 54.9 percent, 49.1 percent, 41.4 percent, 30.8 percent, 15.2 percent,
and 8.3 percent, respectively. This suggests that the disease would most likely remain endemic
even in low periods of infectiousness if no other measures are implemented. Figure 4 shows the
impact of combining a reduction of the duration of infectiousness and delaying restocking by 90
days. The most optimistic scenario is an infectious period of one day and restocking after 90 days
(1.2 percent prevalence).

Mortality rates in poultry: A total of 410,351 chickens out of 2,535,059 (16.2 percent) died from
the disease, and a further 2,123,843 (83.8 percent) were culled (79 percent from the commercial
sector, and 4.8 percent from backyard systems). Based on the above, the disease is likely to
remain endemic if single measures were applied in isolation, e.g., reducing the duration of
infectiousness, even when response time from reporting to culling is reduced to 1.4 days. The
most promising option would be an integrated approach, where the duration of infectiousness is
reduced, while at the same time restocking is delayed.

Estimating cost of the disease: Total cost of HPAI is the sum of direct and indirect costs. The
direct costs of HPAI are the monetary values of these physical losses calculated at market prices.
The indirect costs referred to the ripple effects, the spillover effects, and the wider
macroeconomic effects. . Data were collected on prices for various categories of poultry and eggs,
as well as for the chicken population (26 percent layers, 27 percent broilers, 45 percent backyard,
and 2 percent parent stock). Average egg yield for a commercial layer is estimated at 190 eggs
annually, while that of a village chicken is estimated at 30 eggs. It is also assumed that only 10
percent of eggs produced by backyard chickens are harvested.

The prevalence and mortality rates were derived based on observed data. They are simulated
5,000 times to generate a distribution of the physical losses from mortality among all poultry
categories, as well as the losses in egg production associated with mortality of layers and
backyard chickens. The key output variables are incremental costs, incremental benefits,
incremental net benefits, and benefit cost ratio derived using a 12 percent discount rate with 2007
as the base year. For each key output variable, the 5,000 simulation was applied and plausible
values were obtained.

Figure 5 presents a truncated normal distribution of mortality rate. The average mortality rate is
estimated at 25.8 percent. Based on these parameters, the stochastic average of costs under a

and the benefits to US$330 million (US$0.1 million-1,248 million) , leading to an average net
loss amounting to US$17 million (Table 2).

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

The 2012 KAP Survey was conducted to assess the impact of risk communications
training to poultry farmers. The results are summarized below.

1.      The 2012 KAP survey was designed to assess the effectiveness of previous AI-
IEC campaigns and inform future communications campaigns concerning KAP of the
general population. The survey was conducted across all divisions in Bangladesh. Both
qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to gathered information. Apart
from specific tools to gauge the impact of training and massive IEC campaign, six open-
ended questions were added to the questionnaires used for the earlier KAP surveys (2007
and 2010) conducted by the GoB, with assistance from UNCEF. These earlier surveys
provided the comparators. There were 2,163 respondents from the backyard poultry
sector, with 136 commercial farmer respondents. In addition, a number of stakeholders
along the poultry value chain were interviewed.

Main Findings and Conclusions

2.      Knowledge of Avian Influenza of Backyard Poultry Farmers
In the face of the avian flu outbreaks that began in early 2007, poultry farmers had no
knowledge to deal with this crisis, and viewed AIPRP as an important way to control the
outbreaks and protect their livelihoods. Ninety percent of backyard poultry farmers
indicated that they had no knowledge of HPAI, and 65 percent mentioned that they knew
of bird-to-bird transmission but had no idea about bird-to-human transmission. Two
percent of respondents were able to quote clinical signs of bird flu: sudden death, bluish
changes in skin color, depression and respiratory signs. Over 70 percent of respondents
were aware of avian flu, a significant increase from 2007 when AI was totally unknown
to farmers. Poultry husbandry practices related to biosecurity remains weak. About 58
percent of respondents agreed that separate pens should be used for chickens, and that
enforcement and implementation of biosecurity measures is lacking. Adherence to
hygiene codes, as prescribed by AIPRP, hinges upon tighter monitoring and continuous
advocacy. Between 30 and 40 percent of backyard farmers have made changes in rearing
practices to improve biosecurity.

Knowledge of Avian Influenza of Commercial Poultry Farmers

3.      Eighty percent of respondents mentioned that hand washing was strictly practiced
after touching birds. However, AI workers said that “appropriate and safe? washing
varies from area to area and implementation of biosecurity measures remains inadequate.
Twenty to 30 percent of upazilas have taken measures to establish checkpoints and
wash/disinfect poultry cages. In some upazilas, ULOs have supplied mechanical sprayers
to farmers. In Kapasia, farms verify their poultry transport vehicles as “germ-free.?
Thirty percent of farmers have seen vehicles being washed upon entry or exit of LBMs.
In 60 percent of upazilas, project ownership demonstrated by accepting recommendations
is strong. The seasonality on outbreaks results in a slackening of biosecurity, as
mentioned by 60 percent of respondents.

                                           45
4.      Eighty percent of large and medium-sized farms carry out cleaning and washing
areas appropriately, separate poultry by species, and 60 percent keep children away from
poultry. Training of poultry market chain workers remains limited, and safety measures
are often ignored. According to sellers and processors, wearing gloves and masks scare
away buyers. Market committees have yet to implement intensive cleaning with regular
market closures to carry out firm disinfection breaks. Disease reporting by farm owners
has increased substantially, compared to the baseline scenario (slaughtering, consumption,
and selling of sick birds), and 60 percent of respondents strongly held the view that they
are more conscious of handling poultry safely.

Behavior in key poultry-related activities

5.      Sixty-six percent of poultry transporters/sellers indicated that they sold poultry
from local poultry farms; 64.3 percent bought live chickens, 35.2 percent eggs; 48
percent were middlemen; 45 percent sold chickens “by foot,? and 4.3 percent rented
transport. Sixty-four percent did not think that wild birds were a cause of infection, and
only 8 percent thought there were severe risks. Respondents’ lack of adequate knowledge
of poultry diseases became evident when 42 percent indicated that they thought that
keeping poultry of different species in the same cage was not a risk factor; 55.8 percent
of them said there were some risks, and only 2.2 percent thought that there was a severe
risk of doing so.

6.      Out of 536 backyard farmers surveyed, 24.8 percent said their poultry comes in
contact with wild birds of other species on a daily basis, while 46 percent said their
poultry never does so. However, 98.3 percent of poultry were kept in non-confined
locations, providing significant scope for the poultry to mix with other birds or animals.
Over 50 percent of farmers were reluctant to have their children in close proximity to
their poultry. Forty-two percent of respondents slaughtered and consumed sick poultry.
When asked which government livestock department was nearby, almost 50 percent said
they did not know. Over 90 percent of those surveyed said they never had any liaison
with any employee of the government livestock department.

7.      Half of respondents indicated they disposed of dead birds (dead from any cause)
“in the bush;? about 7 percent threw them in the river. Only 0.2 percent indicated they
informed the livestock office. Almost 10 percent said they did not inform anyone, even if
poultry died of disease. As to why they did not inform anyone, 41.2 percent said that they
did not know they needed to do so; 35.6 percent thought that they were not required to do
so; and 22.5 percent said that they did not know whom to inform.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


1.0 Introduction. The highly pathogenic avian influenza was first detected in Bangladesh
on March 2007. As a result of this new scare, the Government of Bangladesh decided to
control the disease by all available means, including entering into a five-year financial
support agreement with the World Bank for a total of US$21 million, of which US$2
million was recipient’s contribution and US$2 million was from the AHITF. The
Responsible Agency for the project was the Department of Livestock Services (DLS)
under the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock (MOFL) Building 6, Room 509,
Bangladesh Secretariat, Dhaka – 1000 Bangladesh. The country was also supported in
this effort by development agencies and donors, such as USAID, JICA, DANIDA, as
well as others. The intervention methods applied to control the disease were based on
international guidelines prepared by FAO-OIE, and to some extent the WHO. Even
though these interventions are believed to have contributed to controlling the potential
damage the disease could have caused to the public health and the economy of the
country, the disease remains entrenched in Bangladesh.

1.1 Project Objectives. The overall objective of AIPRP is to minimize the threat posed
by pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans in Bangladesh by controlling such
infections in domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling and responding to possible
human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Three main
components were identified for the AIPRP, with specific subcomponents under each one,
as listed below:

(a) Animal Health Component: (a) Strengthening control programs and containment
    plans; (b) Strengthening disease surveillance and diagnostic capacity; (c) Enhancing
    prevention and preparedness capacity; (d) Improving biosecurity in poultry
    production and trade; (e) Supporting surveillance of migratory birds; and (f) Creating
    a Contingency Fund.
(b) Public Awareness and Information Component: (a) Capacity Building; and (b)
    Information and Communication Services.
(c) Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation Component: (a)
    Implementation and Technical Support; (b) WB Implementation Support Mission;
    and (c) Monitoring and Evaluation.

1.2 Project Design. With the above objectives agreed between the Government of
Bangladesh (GoB) and the World Bank, the Avian Influenza Preparedness and Response
Project (AIPRP) was created within the Department of Livestock Services of the Ministry
of Fisheries and Livestock (MoFL). The AIPRP started recruiting its staff from the
government departments to constitute the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), with a
Project Director and a Deputy Project Director (DPD) [serving?] as administrative
managers. The PCU had the following subcomponents: Procurement Unit, Financial
Management Unit, Technical Unit, and support staff. Outside consultants were recruited
to support the Financial Management Unit and the Procurement Unit.



                                           47
In April 2010, three years after the GoB and WB signed an agreement, the Food and
Agriculture Organization was called to provide technical support through its Technical
Assistance System, and the Technical Assistance Services (TAS) group was formed
within the DLS. As a result, the consultants of the TAS team, which cover the fields of
surveillance, biosecurity, M&E, and communication, were recruited for different
durations. In 2010 and 2011, the AIPRP, whose principal activity was to search and
respond to cases of avian influenza, absorbed over 1,000 avian influenza workers and 88
additional veterinary officers, who were working under the USAID-funded and FAO
implemented project. The latter group was supported by the SMS-Gateway reporting
system for rapid response in case of AI detection.

The FAO communication specialist mainly implemented the public awareness and
communication component. She prepared several messages to disseminate to peoples of
different levels of knowledge and understanding of the HPAI situation. Relevant sectors
of society were trained, particularly media personnel and DLS staff. The monitoring and
evaluation team within the FAO-TAS team, which joined the AIPRP two years before the
end of the project, streamlined the project activities and improved the reporting and
communication systems between the Bank and the AIPRP. It developed systems that
enabled the project to intervene more successfully in.

The financial management team, with able consultant support, managed financial
reporting systems to the satisfaction of the donor. The procurement team tried to meet the
project needs and accomplished the implementation of the activities to some extent. An
expert from FAO TAS and a senior technical officer engaged from the DLS coordinated
training on HPAI in general and in biosecurity in particular. The external M&E
consulting firm produced KAP documents reflecting the projects impact in the area of
HPAI control and prevention. The FAO TAS internal M&E supported the project in
producing good expert reports and sound questionnaires for investigative assessments of
project assisted structures and activities.

1.3 Project Implementation. As previously stated, the project was implemented in great
part by the Project Coordination Unit and assisted by private consultants and firms. The
PCU was mainly responsible for preparing necessary procurement documents and
managing the project’s financial aspects. The project director supervised the PCU
members’ day-to-day activities, and approved procurement and disbursement of funds as
needed. The FAO Technical Assistance Services (TAS) implemented the significant
components assigned to it, e.g., managing its own team, preparing meetings with PCU
and other relevant partners, such as the FAO Avian Influenza Unit funded by USAID,
producing communication materials and guidelines, and curricula for different
stakeholders, such as biosecurity intermediaries, laboratory technicians, and community
surveillance agents, such as AIW and AVSs. The advertising firm prepared
communication materials including billboards, posters, festoons, and leaflets. Different
engineering firms selected by the PCU in accordance with the GoB and WB procedures
supported inputs for the construction of LBMs, demonstration farms, FDILs, and
conference rooms.



                                           48
The FAO-TAS Team provided technical specifications for laboratory and some farm or
market materials, and advised the PD and project procurement team on biosecurity
concerns that can impact the new or improved laboratories and farms. The development
of the Biosecure Poultry Market Chain, which took the last 18 months of the project, was
lead principally by the FAO-TAS Team experts with support from PCU and FAO AI
Unit experts. The TAS Team was instrumental in the formation of the Central Task Force
and the District Task Forces, which developed the project activities and surveyed over 50
percent of the potential markets and farms that were selected for inclusion in the project.
Following the joining of the FAO-TAS Team, all the documents including quarterly
progress reports (QPR), project impact reports, and tentative future activity proposals
were prepared with improved quality for submission to relevant World Bank authorities.

1.4 Operational Experiences. The AIPRP contributed greatly in terms of control and
prevention of avian influenza, specifically because it absorbed the AVSs and AIWs from
the FAO implemented, USAID-funded initial project. These groups, in conjunction with
the Epidemiology Unit of DLS and the SMS “Gateway? apparatus already in place, have
enabled the government to be on top of the control initiative and especially in early
detection and reporting. The agreement between FAO and the GoB allowed the insertion
of the FAO-TAS Team in the AIPRP program and helped the project’s activities to move
forward and to achieve its mandate.

The TAS Team was instrumental in developing the communication materials, training
materials, M&E reports, and in providing technical inputs to improve biosecurity in
selected model farms and markets. The PCU is an integral part of the AIPRP, and has
improved its deliveries in the years 2011 and 2012 through the experiences and
assistances provided by the TAS of FAO. The last two entities of the project have
developed strong liaison and communication mechanisms to achieve the majority of the
shared activities to meet the lender’s expectations. The FAO-TAS Team had no mandate
to provide direct support to the PCU’s procurement inputs. Because of this and
government officers’ lack of procurement experience, procurement delays were
unprecedented. As a result, some items necessary to support the laboratories diagnostic
works remain Unobtained. The AIPRP has enjoyed open access to the Director General
and the CVO offices, which facilitated obtaining activity approval. The DLS, which has
the primary mandate to control the scourge of avian influenza, was greatly supported by
the AIWs and AVSs enrolled under this project. The work of the Epidemiology Unit,
created to be an integral part of DLS following the WB Implementation Missions’ strong
recommendations, is highly commendable. The Epidemiology Unit is now included in
the MoFL organogram. The DLS’s agenda includes improving communication
mechanisms within its ranks by including communication experts in the Epidemiology
Unit.

2.0 Outcome of the Project Operations against Agreed Objectives. In spite of the very
slow start of project activities, the AIPRP accomplished the five-year forecasted project
objectives effectively in the last two fiscal years of 2010/11 and 2011/12. The GoB rates
the overall outcome of the project development objectives as satisfactory. The
achievements of the AIPRP against objectives prescribed in the Revised Development
Project Proposal (DPP) are listed below.

                                            49
2.1 The AIPRP has successfully executed payment of compensation rights to 822
farmers that suffered losses as a result of HPAI. The total amount paid up to May 2012
was US$3.88 [million?].

2.2 Surveillance and SMS Gateway: The highly acknowledged Short Message System
was applied successfully after its development by FAO AI Unit. Currently, 306 upazilas
in 64 districts benefit from this reporting system. The AIPR absorbed 103 AVSs and
1,003 AIWs in 2011 to conduct backyard and commercial farms surveillance. These
individuals worked as effective reporting agents to enable the DLS’s rapid detection and
response in case of outbreaks. These agents reported an estimated 5 percent of the
outbreaks in 2011. In addition, the project sustained the field offices involved in HPAI
surveillance by providing fuel and vehicle maintenance.

2.3 Strengthening of Disease Information Networking was accomplished by providing
computers and accessories, including internet modems, to six divisional DLS offices,
FDILS, CDIL, BLRI, and the Epidemiology Unit in Dhaka. Additional funding was also
provided to improve government facilities such as DLS, Gov't Zoo and MoFL and offices
of the National AI Coordinator.

2.4 Disease Search and Diagnostics was enhanced by the renovation, extension or
building of new Field Disease Investigation Laboratories in nine districts of Bangladesh
during the project. Seven of these laboratories were improved and reagents and
equipment were provided to diagnose not only AI infection but also other relevant
diseases. The two other laboratories, Jessore and Chittagong, are fully constructed and
waiting to be equipped. The main animal health building at the National Research
Laboratories-AI of Bangladesh Laboratories Research Institute (BLRI) was renovated
specifically for use in AI diagnosis. The project also provided this AI National Reference
Laboratory with modern diagnostic equipment and reagents for AIV diagnostics.

2.5 Culling, Disposal, and Cleaning and Disinfection that follows confirmation of a
positive AI outbreak were fully financed by the project following the second revision of
the DPP.

2.6 Training and Workshops were conducted during the project for different sectors
of society. The main categories of trainees and the number trained are summarized in the
table below.

Additional training for 630 stakeholders referred to as intermediaries involved in the
Biosecure Live Bird Market Chain initiative was completed in December 23, 2012. This
project training is considered the most efficient. The FAO TAS team contributed
immensely to the training effectiveness of all categories.

2.7 Biosecure Live Bird Market Chain activities were activated only after the ISM of
December 2011, when the DPP was revised and approved. However, the FAO Technical
Assistance Services had understood the sense of the project prior to the PCU and started
assessing the potential to effect this initiative. In nine districts of Bangladesh, LBMs were
renovated with a focus on their biosafety and biosecurity, along with broiler and layer
Demonstration and Adopter farms, which supply the improved markets with healthy
chickens. This activity was funded as Private Public Partnership. All the LBMs and
Demonstration Farms have been completely renovated; while a fraction of the Adopter
farms are in process of renovation. The GoB is highly satisfied with the outcome of this
initiative and will continue to pursue it when the follow up project for AI control and
prevention is launched.

2.8 Public Awareness and Information Component. The AIPRP has benefitted greatly
by incorporating the Awareness and Information Component in its work plan. These
activities were accomplished primarily by the FAO-TAS communication consultant with
technical inputs from the same. The project’s national consultant has designed and
produced communication materials addressing the HPAI situation in the country and
guidelines to prevent infection and disease spread. As indicated in the table paragraph 2.6
above, over 10,000 individuals from different sectors were trained in biosecurity, poultry
production, cleaning and disinfection, and media communication. The DLS staffs, media
personnel, LBM poultry handlers and sellers, and schoolchildren were among the
beneficiaries.

3.0 Recipient/Borrower’s Performance.
3.1 Despite the DLS (borrower/recipient) unpreparedness to mitigate HPAI and lack of
prior experience handling World Bank loans, the DLS slowly has assumed responsibility
for managing the project and controlling the disease. The biggest hurdle was procurement
technicalities and procedures, which the PCU government officials found unclear.
Financial management was also a concern early into the start of the project. However, the
                                                   51
recruitment of a consultant and the efficiency of the assigned government official brought
the financial issues under control. The intended rapid diagnosis and response were
accomplished by reducing the interval between reporting and culling. The interval was
reduced by 80 percent in 2012. The FAO Team’s work with the PCU perhaps helped the
rapid offing of the project towards the end of its effective period. Project activities have
resulted in the training of over 6,000 citizens in AI and its control, as well as in
biosecurity and diagnostics. Nine Field Disease Investigation Laboratories have been
successfully renovated and constructed. DLS has become a leading government structure
that improved a chain of Farms and LBMs interconnected in their approach to control the
AI disease. The AIPRP can be regarded as a pioneer in affecting the use of M&E strategy
to improve project performance and in communication material development to enlighten
the public on the dangers of uncontrolled HPAI.

3.2 Lessons Learned. The GoB and the WB signed the project agreement before
members of the DLS staff were trained in their assigned fields, such as finance,
procurement, and even project implementation. To optimize communication between
different project actors, assigning project directors and/or their deputies who are able to
communicate in a second language, such as English, would have been preferable.
Observations indicate that team members did not seem to understand the seriousness of
their tasks, especially in respect to time constraints in dealing with the outbreak. As a
result, activities were rushed towards the end of the project period. The PCU members
had no exposure to project implementation in the field because they rarely travelled
outside Dhaka. The lack of field experience was attributed to the PCU staff as
government personnel being entitled to a very low daily subsistence allowance. More
frequent visits by World Bank experts working on the project would have been useful to
explain to the project team the procurement and other Bank regulations.

4.0 Proposed arrangements for future project operations. Even though avian
influenza remains endemic in Bangladesh, the government has made progress in
containing it. The momentum needs to be sustained to strengthen simultaneously the
newly created Epidemiology Unit of DLS and the surveillance and diagnostic capacity of
the animal husbandry and public health. Due to the persistence of known enzootic and
transboundary diseases, some of which negatively affect the country’s economy, it is
essential for Bangladesh to pursue disease mitigation methods such as the One Health
approach. After the completion of the current project, the following diseases need to be
addressed in a follow up proposal: Anthrax, which re-emerged in Bangladesh in 2010;
Rabies has resulted in over 300,000 Bangladeshis receiving treatment for rabid dog bites.
Nipah Virus encephalitis is an emerging highly infectious zoonotic viral disease with
high mortality, and Transboundary Animal Diseases (TAD) with a high negative impact
on livelihood. Other high impact diseases to address include the Peste des Petits
Ruminants (PPR), Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), and New Castle Disease (NDV).
Bangladesh should submit a follow up proposal to potential financial and technical
partners as soon as possible to maintain the gained momentum and to achieve the national
objectives of controlling HPAI and other TADs.




                                            52
5.0 Lessons learned. The AIPRP has learned useful lessons in project implementation for
future efforts.

   (a) An emergency project must be launched with experienced personnel for
       successful project delivery and disbursement. In the absence of experienced
       personnel, the project director needs to engage external support.

   (b) The PCU needs to ensure that all sectors are adequately staffed, particularly in
       procurement and contract distribution.

   (c) Continuity of project directors during the activity period is necessary to prevent
       delivery delays.

   (d) Technical requirements need to be assessed in a timely manner to ensure that if
       necessary, a technical support agency, such as the FAO is engaged early in the
       implementation period to ensure delivery of activities. 

6.0. Contribution to the World Bank’s ICR Preparation. The AIPRP openly presented
its project portfolio to the Bank’s ICRR mission and responded to all queries. It allowed
access to every document and activity site, with assistance from its FAO Technical
Assistance Services. During his mission, the ICRR reporter was introduced to all aspects
of the project’s past, present, and future profiles. He visited the MoFL offices and met
with the Secretary of the MoFL to discuss project issues, especially regarding the
surveillance agents that have not yet been absorbed into the government’s budgeted
structure. He was also was briefed by the FAO’s ECTAD country team leader and his
team on the AI situation in Bangladesh and on pending sustainability concerns of the
current activities. The ICR reporter visited the Sirajgonj and the Chittagong Districts
where the project has biosecurity and laboratory development activities, respectively. He
participated in the Bank organized ICRR training. The ICRR reporter had several
briefings and a final debriefing with the WB Task Team Leader who provided clear
guidance in the Bank’s reporting norms and expectations.
