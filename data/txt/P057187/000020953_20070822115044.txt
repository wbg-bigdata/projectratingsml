F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the project is to increase the soundness and competitiveness of the
financial sector and improve access by small savers and micro entrepreneurs to the
formal financial system.       This will be accomplished by:          (i) restructuring and/or
privatizing state-owned banks including transforming the NMB into                    a private
microfinance bank; (ii) strengthening the supporting financial infrastructure by, inter-alia,
enhancing the capacity of the central bank to supervise banks and by improving the



                                                ii

efficiency of the national payments system; and (iii) increasing savings and investment
opportunities by promoting the development of contractual savings and capital markets.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Financial sector reform was a crucial part of the country strategy. At appraisal, the
primary objective of International Development Association's (IDA) assistance strategy
to Tanzania was to reduce poverty through an acceleration of broad-based private sector
growth. A new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Tanzania had been finalized in
2000. The CAS emphasized the need for private sector and infrastructure development,
sustainable rural development, improved social infrastructure, and public sector reform
and institution building. The successful implementation of banking reforms and increased
private investment in the financial sector were considered crucial for accelerating growth
and required for improving broad-based access to financial services.

Considerable scope for improved supply of financial services existed. A study
commissioned by the Bank of Tanzania in 1997 found that the rural population, roughly
85 percent of the total population, demanded a high quality savings service for very low
balance accounts with relatively few transactions. On the credit side, small loans with
repayment periods adjusted to accommodate the pattern of income flows were demanded.
In addition, a relatively wealthier segment of the rural population and urban
microenterprises could absorb more traditional products and higher loan amounts. In
terms of supply, the financial penetration in Tanzania was small at the time of appraisal,
with deposits per GDP at a relatively low 15 percent and only 195 branches serving a
population of 33 million.

The continuation of reforms in the financial sector was essential. The Second Financial
Institutions Development Project (FIDP II) was designed to: (a) complete the program of
technical assistance begun under the first FIDP; and (b) finance the investments
associated with the transformation of the largest state-owned savings bank to a privately
owned microfinance bank. The predecessor project, FIDP, had been approved in 1995 to
support the Government's financial sector development strategy. The elements of the
strategy had been to: i) encourage competition in the commercial banking sector; ii)
strengthen banking regulation and supervision; iii) improve the payments system
nationwide; and iv) develop contractual savings and a market for government and
corporate securities with the requisite regulatory structures. A parallel credit, the
Parastatal and Public Sector Management Project, supported a complimentary parastatal
privatization program.

Bank privatization was the key element of the reform agenda. The emphasis under FIDP
was on the restructuring and privatization of the largest and state-owned bank, the
National Bank of Commerce (NBC). The political consensus for restructuring the original
NBC took more time and resources to achieve than anticipated. After prolonged
deliberations that took almost two years, the Government implemented a radical
restructuring plan in October 1997, splitting the original NBC into two banks, the new
NBC (1997) and the National Microfinance Bank (NMB). NBC (1997) was designed to



                                              1

be a full commercial bank with business lines targeted to larger commercial enterprises.
NMB was to provide nation-wide coverage with business lines targeted to small
depositors. All lending products were assigned to NBC (1997). Both banks were offered
for sale in August 1998. A 70 percent stake in NBC (1997) was sold to Amalgamated
Banks of South Africa (ABSA) in 1999. However, the attempt to privatize NMB was not
successful. The Government recognized that a successful sale would have to be preceded
by a bond issue to bring the bank's net worth to zero, an agreement on donor financing
for a substantial portion of the start-up costs, and recruitment of professional bankers and
microfinance experts to take over the management of NMB and transform its basic
business line to cater for small-scale financial services. FIDP II was designed to address
this need.

Building the capacity of financial regulators and strengthening the financial
infrastructure had been a complementary priority of the reform agenda. Through FIDP-
funded training courses and with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the Directorate of Banking Supervision (DBS) developed most of the basic skills for
supervising banks. DBS capacity needed to be further developed, however, especially in
light of the continuing bank privatizations, the increase in the number of banks, and the
emerging need to supervise microfinance institutions. Other components under FIDP that
remained on the reform agenda were payment systems, contractual savings, credit
information, capital markets, and the restructuring of the People's Bank of Zanzibar
(PBZ), a small government-owned bank (for FIDP II, two other government-owned
banks, Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) and Tanzania Postal Bank (TPB), were put on
the agenda along with PBZ). These components were delayed under FIDP, partly due to
the unexpected amount of resources and effort that had been required to restructure NBC.
Further progress on these elements was deemed to be necessary for the success of the
financial sector reforms.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The objective of the project is to increase the soundness and competitiveness of the
financial sector and improve access by small savers and micro entrepreneurs to the
formal financial system. This will be accomplished by: (i) restructuring and/or privatizing
state-owned banks including transforming NMB into a private microfinance bank; (ii)
strengthening the supporting financial infrastructure by, inter-alia, enhancing the capacity
of the central bank to supervise banks and by improving the efficiency of the national
payments system; and (iii) increasing savings and investment opportunities by promoting
the development of contractual savings and capital markets.

Project benefits are measured through an assessment of reduced government ownership
of (as a proxy for intervention in) the banking sector, the soundness of the banking
system as measured by the extent of non-performing assets in the banking system, and
increased access by rural savers and micro entrepreneurs to the formal financial system.
The three main PDO indicators are the following:




                                               2

                     PDO Indicators                         Baseline (Dec. 1998)      Target
Share of deposits in private banks to total deposits               51.5%               98%
Reduction in non-performing loans to total assets                   4%                 2%
Increase in rural deposits                                           n/a               14%

At the launch of the project, the original PDO indicators were expanded to include three
further indicators, previously designated as intermediate outcome targets. This refinement
is why the data sheet above lists six PDO indicators, while the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) and the table of indicators in this section list only three. All the PDO
indicators and all the intermediate outcome targets, as well as the degree to which the
targets were achieved, are discussed below in Section 3.2.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There are no revised PDO.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary beneficiary of the project was the Government of Tanzania, as the owner of
NMB. Financial and technical resources were provided to support the privatization of the
government-owned bank. The Government benefited directly from the sale of NMB and
will continue to benefit when the now-profitable bank will continue to deliver significant
receipts in taxes and dividends. The Government of Tanzania benefited directly from the
increased capacity (including IT infrastructure) at DBS, Payments Systems, Insurance
Supervisory Department (ISD), and Capital Markets Supervisory Authority (CMSA). It
benefited from the technical analyses of the consultancies as a means for formulating its
strategy for continued financial sector reform.

The secondary beneficiaries of FIDP II are rural households and small scale enterprises.
The turnaround of NMB has increased the availability of financial services in rural areas
and increased the quality of the available services. Finally, all actors in the financial
sector, including the commercial banks and the population as a whole, have benefited
from a strengthened financial sector, from the increased stability of the economy
resulting from the improved supervisory capacity of regulators, and the greater diversity
of available financial instruments and products.

1.5 Original Components

The original components, as approved, are listed here with, in parentheses, the amount of
the original allocation for total project input. This original allocation includes the
Government's contributions. The specific outputs are listed in Annex 2, with general
discussion of the implementation below in Section 2.2.

Bank Restructuring:
The World Bank's financial and technical assistance for the restructuring of the state-


                                                 3

owned banks is what contributed directly to the achievement of the PDO by enabling the
transformation of these institutions and their integration into the market economy.

     NBC Privatization (US$ 1,592,147). Last remaining consultancies and audits
        from the NBC privatization, including retroactive financing. The sale of NBC was
        finalized and the management duties handed over to ABSA before FIDP II
        became effective. This subcomponent was peripheral to FIDP II.
     NMB Strengthening and Privatization (US$ 18,458,198). Consultant fees for
        managing NMB up to the point of sale of the bank, Information Technology (IT)
        investments in NMB, training of NMB staff, fees for privatization and legal
        advisors for the sale itself, fee for microfinance advisor at the Bank of Tanzania
        (BOT), subcomponent for deposit mobilization and supporting audits for NMB. In
        addition, the component provided funds for retrenchment of NMB staff.
     Privatization/Restructuring of PBZ, TPB, TIB (US$ 500,000). Fees for
        consultancies to do analysis and make recommendations regarding the options for
        privatization and/or restructuring of the three government-owned banks.

Financial Infrastructure Strengthening:
Strengthening the financial infrastructure contributes to the PDO by strengthening the
institutions responsible for regulating financial sector institutions.

     Banking Supervision (US$ 3,031,272). Training for the staff of DBS and purchase
        of IT equipment.
     Payments System (US$ 950,000). Training for the staff of National Payment
        Systems.
     Credit Information Bureau (CIB) (US$ 586,000). Cost of feasibility study and
        start-up costs.
     Contractual Savings (US$ 600,000). Fees for consultants (e.g. resident advisor for
        ISD) and analytical work for the insurance and pension sector, training of staff,
        cost of privatization study of National Insurance Corporation (NIC).
     Capital Markets and Securities Authority (US$ 1,102,000). Salary for the CEO,
        training for staff, fees for consultants, cost of IT for CMSA and IT infrastructure
        for stock exchange.

Privatization Trust (US$ 800,000). Fees for consultants to manage the Trust and
operating expenses of the Privatization Trust.

Project Management (US$ 390,000). Expenses for implementation and supervision of the
project.

The table below illustrates how the components of the predecessor project FIDP and
follow-on project Financial Sector Support Project (FSP) fit together. The details to each
component are discussed below; the status listed here is for illustrative purposes only.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no revisions to the components.

1.7 Other significant changes

Schedule: The closing date of the credit was extended three times. The original closing
date was December 31, 2003. The project was extended to December 31, 2004, then to
December 31, 2005, and finally to December 31, 2006, which is when the project closed.
The reason for the extensions was delays due primarily to the resistance to the
privatization of NMB from vested political interests and the Government's inability to
move forward with the initially agreed-upon timeline. The first extension was authorized
by the Country Director and the subsequent two extensions were authorized by the
Regional Vice President.

Management contract extensions for NMB strengthening: As a consequence of the delays
in the privatization of NMB, the contract for the management contractors for NMB until
the completion of the privatization process was extended several times. The contract
extensions were approved in the regular IDA procurement process, through provision of
"no objection". The original contract was due to end in April 2001. It was extended to
April 2002, April 2003, April 2004, April 2005, and finally to December 2005 or until
privatization took place, whichever was earlier. Privatization took place in September
2005 and the contract was closed.

NMB retrenchment funds: Funds that were earmarked for the retrenchment of employees
of NMB were not used as very few employees were retrenched and NMB used its own
funds. Instead, the funds were earmarked for retrenchment of PBZ employees. However,
the deadline of March 30, 2007 agreed with the Government of Zanzibar for the sale of
PBZ was missed, and the grace period for withdrawal of credit proceeds expired before
the funds could be used. The amendment of the Development Credit Agreement to allow
for funds to be used for the retrenchment of PBZ employees was authorized by the
Country Director.

Privatization Trust: The component for the Privatization Trust was dropped after the
lifetime of the trust expired, though the project components were not officially revised.



                                              5

The original intention of the Privatization Trust was to hold shares of privatized
companies and then sell them to the broader public as a way of ensuring they participated
in the privatization and become part-owners of the new companies. The Trust ended up
not being used for the privatizations to the general public as the number of companies
that were privatized were very few. In 2004 the funds were reallocated to the overall
project.

NIC Divestiture: Funds were allocated from the Unallocated Category to support the
implementation of the divestiture of NIC. The divestiture process was not completed by
the closing of FIDP II and outstanding activities are being funded from another IDA
project.

Review of the Land Act 1999: The Tanzanian Bankers' Association (TBA) appealed to
the Government to review the Land Act as it was a major constraint to the use of land as
collateral by borrowers. The project provided funds for a consultancy to review the Land
Act 1999 and make recommendations for appropriate amendments.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Lessons of earlier operations were taken into account. FIDP II was a follow-on project to
FIDP (itself a follow-on project to an earlier Financial Sector Adjustment Credit). The
lessons from these previous projects and international best practice in microfinance
informed the design of FIDP II. Especially noteworthy was the gradual introduction of
lending products transforming NMB from a savings bank into a microfinance bank. This
part of the project design was a consequence of the earlier split between NBC and NMB,
under FIDP, when all lending products were transferred to NBC.

The design of FIDP II reflected the World Bank's understanding and continued support
of the transformation of the role of the Government in the financial sector. The role of the
Government as the direct provider of services was reduced through the privatization of
government-owned banks. At the same time, the role of the Government was
strengthened in terms of the supervisory capacity and the publicly provided financial
infrastructure. Modern financial markets require strong, capable oversight and well-
developed financial infrastructure, such as payment systems, capital markets, and a
regulatory environment conducive to contractual savings. Successful privatizations
depend on these elements. In supporting financial sector reforms in this way, the design
of FIDP II followed the design of its predecessor project. The support of the additional
components, other than the privatizations of NBC and NMB, is continued under FSP and
reflects the long-term perspective of the project design.

While the overall risks were adequately identified, the timetable for implementation was
ambitious and perhaps overly optimistic. The PAD rated the overall risk of the project as
substantial. Three specific, substantial risks were identified, namely that (i) investors
might not be interested in NMB; (ii) the Government might interfere with the operations



                                               6

of NMB; or (iii) NMB might not operate according to best practices in microfinance. The
risk of limited commitment by the Government, on the other hand, was judged to be only
a moderate risk. It turned out that the resistance to the privatization and to the reform
steps in other subcomponents was strong. The experience with the difficulty in achieving
political consensus and arriving at the decision to split NBC and NMB and privatize them
separately would have warranted a higher risk rating, rather than a lower rating compared
to other identified risks. In order to measure and maintain the Government's commitment
to the privatization, ongoing, high-level dialogue was recommended. In consideration of
the earlier experiences with achieving political consensus, the timetable of the project
was optimistic. Benefits of such a tight timetable are noted below in Section 3.1.

2.2 Implementation

In general, the project's implementation was responsive to external changes. The
supervision by the World Bank focused on continued discussions with the Government
towards deepening the consensus around the privatization agenda. The Mid-Term Review
in February 2002 in particular was held in this spirit. Similarly, the World Bank followed
very closely the work of the management consultants in charge of turning NMB around
and kept the Government engaged, through the Parastatal Reform Commission (PSRC),
on the need to manage the consultants properly so as to get NMB in good shape before its
privatization.

Political difficulties in maintaining support for the reform agenda led to significant
delays and adjustment in strategy for the privatization of NMB. The implementation was
impacted on the Government's side by the political difficulties in maintaining the
cohesive support for the privatization agenda. Especially once NMB's performance under
the management contractors began to exceed expectations, the privatization of NMB lost
momentum and started to become more difficult. As the profits of NMB rose, so did the
voices expressing opposition to the privatization. The Government was unable to
maintain support for the original plan of privatization that called for a sale of 70 percent
of NMB shares to a strategic investor. At the height of the heated political debate, the
Board of Directors of NMB, appointed by the President, publicly expressed its opposition
to the privatization. The President responded by replacing the Board in its entirety. The
result of these political challenges, apart from the delays of one and a half years in the
privatization, was an amended privatization strategy, calling for a sale of only 49 percent
of NMB shares to a strategic investor. A further 21 percent would be sold to Tanzanian
citizens at a later date. The process of selling the 21 percent was recently initiated.

The implementation of other components of the project was delayed due to a lack of
political will and problems with coordination. The restructuring and privatization of PBZ,
TPB, and TIB was delayed and all three banks are still owned by the Government.
Setting up the CIB was delayed, when TBA's initiative stalled due to resistance of the
banks against sharing data and lack of agreement on the structure of the ownership of the
bureau. The project's efforts for a unified regulatory structure for pensions did not result
in an implemented solution, but managed to enable a clearer understanding and an
emerging consensus among the relevant political actors. These components enjoyed, in



                                               7

comparison with the NMB privatization, limited attention but their delays did not impact
the reform effort more broadly.

The 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) gave the implementation new
energy. An FSAP was conducted in May 2003. The recommendations supported the
reform agenda of FIDP II and thus infused the implementation with a refreshed sense of
urgency, especially for the strengthening of the financial infrastructure. For example, the
FSAP recommended that BOT take the lead in forming the credit bureau, rather than
relying on TBA to make progress, which it hadn't done. The FSAP also emphasized
specific needs in insurance regulation and supervision, which were subsequently
addressed by ISD with the help of a resident advisor, hired with FIDP II funds.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The three original PDO indicators listed in the PAD were, in principle, well chosen to
assess the progress and success of the project. Rural access to financial services,
government intervention in the banking sector, and the soundness of the banking system
are the right constructs to measure the success of the project. However, the first and
second of these measures fall a little short in terms of their exact definition or choice of
specific indicator.
     Increased access by rural savers: When the indicator was proposed, no direct
        reference was made to the available data (i.e. data that the banks themselves
        actually can and do collect). A definition that would work in practice had yet to be
        established. Given the lack of data availability, the eventual definition (proportion
        of deposits held in branches that are not located in urban areas) rendered the
        indicator slightly less precise than the original M&E design had intended.
     It is debatable, particularly in Tanzania, whether the degree of government
        ownership (still) provides a sufficiently responsive proxy for government
        intervention in the banking sector. In the case of NMB, the Government remains
        the majority shareholder at 51 percent. Management control over the bank's
        operations, however, was passed on to Rabobank, at the time when the Rabobank
        consortium acquired 49 percent of NMB shares. So far, there is no evidence of
        government interference in the management of NMB. Thus, recording NMB as a
        state-owned bank, as this indicator imposes, does not adequately reflect the locus
        of managerial control in the banking sector.

These two (limited) caveats regarding the suitability of the performance indicators
notwithstanding, appropriate data was collected for all performance indicators by the
BOT. The reliability of the data is high. The values of the performance indicators did not
require any adjustment in the project.

As mentioned above, three further indicators, were added to the PDO indicators, bringing
the total number to six. The purpose of this refinement was to measure progress for the
project's individual components more prominently. Beyond this, the change did not
impact the monitoring of the project. In this Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR), for the discussion of indicators, the three added PDO indicators are



                                               8

discussed within the intermediate outcome targets, since they were originally designated
and formulated as such.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

There were no fiduciary, environmental, social or safeguard problems. The overall
financial management of FIDP II is satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

Following the FSAP in early 2003, the Government used its recommendations to draw up
a roadmap for a second generation financial sector reform program. A follow-on project
to FIDP II, the FSP, is based on this roadmap and became effective on November 28,
2006. Subcomponents that have not been completed in FIDP II (pensions, PBZ
privatization, CIB) are also included in this follow-on project. FSP is co-funded by the
Department for International Development (DFID) and IDA and reflects the efforts
towards donor harmonization and sector-wide approaches. The transition to FSP has been
smooth largely because of the experience gained by BOT in managing IDA projects over
the years.

The main performance indicators for FSP and the most suitable measures for the long-
term impact of FIDP II are:
     Credit extended to the private sector as a percentage of GDP
     Interest rate spreads (lending versus deposit rates)
     Proportion of adult population that uses financial services provided by formal
        financial service providers
     Proportion of financial institutions in compliance with capital adequacy ratios
        (commercial banks, insurance companies and pension funds)

To communicate the considerable success of the NMB privatization, a case-study is being
prepared to document the process, the key success factors and the main challenges of the
privatization.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The development objectives of FIDP II were (and remain today) highly relevant for the
country priorities and for the overall assistance strategy of the World Bank. The
Government's strategy emphasized the need to attain a higher growth rate through rural
development, private sector growth, and investments in infrastructure, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The World Bank's CAS of 2000 followed the country priorities
closely and outlined a broadening of the World Bank's efforts from the macroeconomic
focus of earlier years. The PDO of FIDP II was directly relevant to three of the four main
pillars, namely private sector development, rural development and strengthening of
public institutions.



                                              9

The urgent need to transform the role of the state in guiding economic development is a
central theme in the country and World Bank strategies. The privatization of NMB and
the concurrent strengthening of supervisory capacity and the financial infrastructure
constitutes an important, timely element in the reform efforts of Tanzania. The design of
the project, its scope and complexity, was ambitious but well-suited to complement the
overall reforms and to increase the chances of success. The lack of progress on certain
subcomponents suggests that the project may have been too broadly designed, with too
many subcomponents requiring a high degree of political consensus. However, a
reduction in the scope would reduce the time spent in discussion and thus in forming the
needed consensus, even if the implementation is only partially completed.

The ambitious timetable may have had beneficial effects. As discussed earlier, the
timetable for the project was ambitious. The extension of the project by three years and
the inability to complete the implementation of some of the components confirms this.
Aside from this shortcoming, however, the timetable may have been well suited to
provide the reformers within the Government additional incentives for maintaining the
direction of the reform, when the pace of implementation lagged. By imposing a
somewhat onerous process of extending the project as well as the eventual limit for doing
so (no more than three times) the optimistic timetable may have contributed to the
implementation of the project's main component.

The implementation coordination reflected best practice. Just as with the predecessor
project FIDP, the coordination of the implementation of FIDP II was mainstreamed into
the activities of DBS, instead of establishing a separate Project Implementation Unit. This
aspect of the project design improved the overall country ownership and indirectly
strengthened the capacity and authority of DBS.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project development objective was achieved. Access by small savers and micro
entrepreneurs to a sound and competitive financial system in Tanzania has definitely
improved. The three original PDO indicators are shown in the table below:

              Original PDO Indicators                    Baseline     Original    Actual
                                                        (12/31/98)     Target    (12/31/06)
Share of deposits in private banks to total deposits      51.5%         98%        79%
Reduction in non-performing loans to total assets          4%           2%          3%
Increase in rural deposits                                 n/a          14%       > 80%

According to the indicators, only one of the three main targets has been met, albeit in a
dramatic fashion. The other two indicators show progress in achieving the target. The
numbers in this case understate the change in the key constructs that the indicators are
measuring. First, if deposits in NMB (51 percent government-owned) would be added to
the deposits in private banks the indicator value would increase to 84 percent. This figure
is still below the target, but it does show that considerable progress has been made. The
proportion of non-performing loans is higher than the target value and this is cause for


                                                10

some concern. The value has fluctuated in the last years and remained at 1 percent, well
below the target value, for most of 2005. According to DBS, the increase during 2006 to
3 percent is a result of the poor performance of about seven large borrowers in five of the
big banks. The poor performance can be primarily attributed to the drought, coupled with
power shortages which hit the country in 2006, changes on taxation for petroleum
products, and poor performance of the railway services. The increase was also marginally
influenced by a stricter requirement for classifying non-performing micro loans,
following the implementation of the Micro Lending Regulations of 2005.

The sustained expansion of access for the rural population and the concurrent
privatization of the largest state-owned banks is an exceptional and inspiring outcome of
FIDP II. The restructuring and privatization of NMB is the most important output of the
project, with 58 percent of the originally allocated funds dedicated to it, and it was
delivered with considerable success. The technical and financial assistance from the
project directly enabled the transformation of an insolvent, government-owned bank
without any lending products and negative net worth, into a competitive, profitable
commercial bank that caters to the rural population. Outreach to the rural population,
often the prominent victim in the process of bank privatization, has increased and is
continuing to increase. Outstanding NMB microfinance loans grew to TZS 117 billion
(US$ 89.1 million) in September 2006 with more than 165,000 borrowers since lending
started in August 2000. NMB's deposit base grew fourfold, reaching 750,000 depositors
with its extensive rural branch network, which grew from 95 branches in 1997 to 115
branches in 2006. With 22 percent of assets and 16 percent of deposits of the banking
system, NMB is also a major source of payments in the country and related services to all
its depositors. The Government's commitment to the financial sector reform agenda more
generally had been tied to the project's ability to improve access to financial services in
rural areas. Since the outcome of the project has delivered improved access in such
convincing fashion, the Government has committed itself to further reforms, as evidenced
by the follow-on project FSP.

Strong growth and deepening of the financial sector is evident in further indicators.
Credit to the private sector, one of the main PDO indicators for FSP, increased from
3 percent of GDP in 1996 to 10 percent of GDP in 2005. Financial sector depth measured
as M2/GDP increased from 15 percent in 1999 to close to 20 percent in 2005. These
changes were driven by increased competition in the financial sector due to the improved
governance in the privatized banks, the reduction in very high gross interest spreads for
the largest borrowers, and increased soundness of the financial system due to
strengthened capacity at DBS.

Despite a mid-implementation change in privatization strategy, management control of
NMB has been passed on as originally intended. The change in the privatization strategy
and the sale of only 49 percent of NMB shares to a banking consortium (rather than the
initially planned 70 percent) reduces the completeness of the privatization's success
somewhat. However, with the sale of the shares, day-to-day management was effectively
ceded to Rabobank as the leader of the banking consortium. As a result, the achievement
of the project's development objectives and the probable sustainability of the reforms has



                                              11

not been impacted negatively by the change in strategy. The preparations for the sale of
21 percent of the remaining shares to Tanzanian citizens illustrates the sustainability of
the privatization.

The achievement in terms of the additional subcomponents has been mixed. The capacity
of regulators was strengthened through FIDP II. DBS, CMSA, and ISD are capable and
well organized and are recognized as such. All financial institutions that fall under the
purview of these institutions are currently inspected at least once a year and
recommendations from inspections are enforced. Substantial improvements in the
financial infrastructure, in particular the improvements in regulatory oversight, capital
markets and payments system, were noted and praised by market participants. On the
other hand, the restructuring and privatization of the smaller government-owned banks
(PBZ, TIB, TPB) was not successful, though the process of privatizing PBZ is ongoing.
The CIB and pension regulations were not implemented as designed. Due to delays,
dropped components (Privatization Trust), and undisbursed funds (NMB retrenchment,
for example), only US$ 22.4 million or roughly 80 percent of project funds of US$ 27.5
million were disbursed during the project.

was a technical assistance project. Attempts to determine an ERR are in such cases not
meaningful.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating of the overall outcome is justified because the development
objective was achieved and a key indicator far exceeded the set target. The central
outputs of this project, the privatization of NMB and strengthening of regulatory capacity,
have a high development impact. NMB's continued profitability and expansion of service
provision in rural areas and for the low-income population can be directly attributed to
the project. The success of this bank privatization has an important signaling effect about
the potential of well-designed reforms in the financial sector, in Tanzania and beyond. In
addition, commercial banks have begun to move downmarket, partly in response to
NMB's success, in order to compete more effectively for this business. The risk to the
long-term sustainability of this development outcome is low.

Since not all target values have been reached, even after the project was extended three
times, a highly satisfactory rating is not justified. However, in relation to the important
primary achievement of the project and the impact that the achievement has on the
development of Tanzania, the discussed shortcomings and delays in the project's other
components are minor.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The successful privatization of a state-owned microfinance bank and the concurrent
strengthening of the financial infrastructure directly impacts the sustained increase in
access to financial services among the lower-income segments of the population. Such
improved access to financial services is an important factor in poverty alleviation. This
impact on poverty alleviation is indirect and impossible to quantify with any degree of
confidence. Nevertheless, the achievement of the project's development objectives
supports indirectly poverty alleviation and the degree to which the rural population can
participate in economic growth.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The (partially) privatized NMB is a profitable bank with solid management. NMB
continues to devote significant resources to the further building of internal capacity. The
first priority for NMB management is the strengthening of the institution as a customer-
oriented financial provider.

The capacity of DBS in particular has been commended among all the project's
beneficiaries and involved parties. It should be noted that the project coordination
responsibilities of DBS have contributed to capacity building. The supervisory capacity at
the CMSA and the ISD have also been significantly enhanced.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

As mentioned above, the success of NMB's transformation in terms of simultaneous
increases in financial performance (profitability and financial soundness) and outreach
(provision of financial services to rural areas) has an important signaling effect. First,
within Tanzania, it helps in the economic transformation by providing a positive result of
moving to a market economy. Second, beyond Tanzania, the positive outcome serves as
an example for other financial sector reforms and other, potential bank privatizations.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No formal beneficiary survey or stakeholder workshop was conducted.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Negligible to Low

The low risk to the achieved development outcomes constitutes a considerable success of
the project. The development outcomes are sustainable, because they have been
institutionalized and are currently being expanded upon. The follow-on project FSP is
specifically designed to build on, consolidate and further strengthen the positive
outcomes achieved in FIDP II.

5. Assessment of World Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 World Bank Performance
(a) World Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating is justified, since the overall assessment of risks was adequate at
entry. The strategy laid out was well designed, reflecting past lessons learned,
international best practice in the area of microfinance, and best practice by
mainstreaming project implementation. The successful implementation of the strategy, on
a technical level, confirmed the quality of the project's design.

A higher rating is not justified, since the political risk of resistance to the Government's
reform agenda was understated at the outset. The three extensions of the project and the
postponement of certain subcomponents to implementation in FSP are a function of the
optimistic timetable and reflect minor shortcomings in the assessment at entry.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating is justified, because the flexibility within the project and ability of
the project management to maintain the momentum of the overall reform agenda
indicates a high quality of project supervision. The sustainability of achievements and the
continuation of the reform agenda is also a result of the well-designed project to follow,
FSP.

A higher rating is not justified, because of delays in providing "no objection" to requests
for training and consultancies that were part of the original plan. In individual instances
"no objections" were given only after the training or consultancy had to be cancelled,
postponed, or paid for with other funds. These delays had no further impact on project
outcomes.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall World Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Due to a well-designed project and solid supervision, the project outcomes were achieved
even after periods of considerable risk to the success of the project. The World Bank is
responsible for some minor delays in the implementation, both in the design stage and
during supervision. These delays had only a minor impact on the project.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating is justified, because the Government remained ultimately committed
to the reform despite considerable opposition to bank privatization. The Government took
political risks (replacing NMB Board) and advocated forcefully for reform midway


                                               15

through the project's implementation, which has facilitated the continuation of the reform
agenda. Thanks to the continued commitment to reforms the sustainability of
achievements and their further development is very likely.

A higher rating is not justified, because the delays in the project due to political
uncertainties, across a number of project components and most notably the NMB
privatization, reflect an uneven support for and understanding of the Government's
privatization agenda. The modalities of the privatization were altered. Some of the main
targets were not met within the project's duration, even after extensions.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating is justified, because the performance of the implementing agencies
and especially of the implementation coordinators (DBS) was consistently rated as very
high by those closely involved in the project and quoted as a key reason for the project's
relative success.

A higher rating is not justified, since not all subcomponents were implemented readily.
The political coordination was less smooth than anticipated, in individual instances due to
the resistance of the implementing agencies themselves. There were some delays in
procurement from the Government's side and individual problems arose in the
management of contracts, leading to cost overruns on subcomponents.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Though the political difficulties with the implementation of FIDP II were considerable,
the opposition to privatization was overcome and the project was largely implemented,
reflecting a strong commitment to the reform agenda.

6. Lessons Learned

    1. The privatization of large state-owned banks can directly lead to a sustained
        improvement of access to financial services in rural areas. The improved
        financial performance of a newly privatized bank need not come at the expense of
        a contraction of service provision, as it has been so often the case in other
        instances. The three key ingredients to a successful transformation are (a)
        resources for training and IT; (b) isolation of management decisions from political
        interference, including a realistic timetable for rolling out new products such as
        microfinance; and (c) high quality leadership in bank management and in
        oversight.

    2. Building a strong financial infrastructure is essential, but progress can be slow
        and certain reforms may have to be sequential. The transformation to a modern
        financial sector depends crucially on the strengthening of the financial
        infrastructure, including capital markets, payments system and effectively


                                               16

        enforced regulations. From a technical standpoint, any delays are likely to have a
        negative impact. Politically, such reforms are almost always highly controversial
        (as they were in this case). Being able to establish and maintain the political
        consensus for reform may require, along with ongoing dialogue and coordination,
        that initial reform components are seen to be successful or that implementing
        agencies develop a track record that inspires confidence. The World Bank's
        strong support and engagement in the policy dialogue can facilitate this process.

    3. Long-term investment in capacity building of regulators is a key success factor for
        successful project implementation, especially with regards to privatizations.
        Capacity building measures that are designed to be successful in this manner are
        likely to span the duration of several projects. This present challenges for the
        project design, but also for the evaluation of projects (e.g. problems of attribution,
        measurable results).

    4. Mainstreaming of project implementation contributes significantly to
        strengthening of client capacity and to signaling clear lines of authority vis--vis
        the private sector. For improved efficiency, use of national procurement systems
        should be considered, if local capacity is high (as it has been for this project). For
        example, it may be useful to provide coordinators with the authority to sign-off on
        (i.e. provide "no objection" to) pre-approved subcomponents of a training plan.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Government's ICR is in Annex 7. The Government's ICR provides a thorough
narrative of the project and its components. It complements the above evaluation well. In
its ICR, the Government concludes that the time needed for the privatization may have
been understated at the outset and notes that the process of privatization itself is both
cumbersome and politically sensitive. Some of the minor shortcomings that are discussed
above are noted and the considerable success of the project is emphasized. The World
Bank agrees with the Government's conclusions. In turn, the Government stated that it
has no additional comments to make on this report as it arrives at similar conclusions as
its contribution to the ICR.

 I. INTRODUCTION:

   1.      Economic reforms in Tanzania started in the late 1980s. The initial reforms in the
   financial sector were focused on the liberalization of the sector together with setting up
   the required legal and regulatory framework. They were supported by IDA credit for
   Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) which became effective in 1990. After the
   FSAC, the Government carried out further reforms aimed at building on the
   achievements of the FSAC and addressing the remaining fundamental weaknesses in the
   sector.

   2.      This round of reforms was also supported by IDA credit under the Financial
   Institutions Development Project (FIDP) which became effective in 1996 and included
   initial steps in the privatization of the largest state-owned commercial bank, the
   strengthening of banking supervision, and development of the insurance industry and
   capital markets. FIDP was closed in June 1999.

   3.      In order to support the conclusion of the bank privatization program and further
   deepen the reforms in other areas of the financial sector, the Second Financial Institutions
   Development Project (FIDP II), herein referred to as the Project, was initiated and
   became effective in September 2000. Generally, the project was to complete the program
   of technical assistance begun under FIDP and finance the investments associated with the
   transformation of the largest state owned banks into privately managed and owned
   microfinance bank.

   4.      The objective of the Project was to increase the soundness and competitiveness of
   the financial sector and to improve access by small savers and micro entrepreneurs to the
   formal financial system.

   5.      The objectives were to be accomplished through:
       a) Restructuring and/or privatising state owned banks including transforming the
           NMB into a private microfinance bank;
       b) Strengthening the supporting financial infrastructure by inter-alia enhancing the
           capacity of the financial sector regulators; and,
       c) Increasing savings and investment opportunities by promoting development of
           contractual savings and capital markets.

II. FIDP II DESIGN AND COMPONENTS TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES

   6.      The Project, which was supported by a US$ 27.5 million IDA credit, consisted of
   the following components:

          Establishment and management of operations of the Privatization trust.


III. ADEQUACY OF PROJECT DESIGN AND RESPONSIVENESS OF THE
     PROJECT OBJECTIVES

   7.     During the implementation of the FIDP, the Government's major priority was
   correcting the massive distortions in the banking system emanating from market
   dominance, combined with the insolvency, of the state-owned bank. However, most of
   the resources under FIDP were re-allocated to the critical component for privatization of
   NBC, and therefore a long agenda remained un-completed on the other components.

   8.     NMB had to be restructured and undergo transformation of its major business line
   to cater for small-scale financial services. It was therefore inevitable to put in place a
   management contractor, strengthen the capacity to develop and market micro finance
   lending instruments, and modernise its MIS. All these measures were seen as essential in
   generating investor response during privatization.

   9.     In line with the Government's policy to exit from the commercial aspects of
   banking, aimed at liberalizing the financial sector with a view of deepening competition
   in the sector so as to accelerate economic growth; it deemed fit to carry out a review of
   the options for restructuring and privatizing the remaining state owned banks, namely
   TPB, TIB and PBZ; and thereafter carry out recommendations thereof.

   10.    Although the Directorate of Banking Supervision had developed most of the basic
   skills necessary to conduct banking examination including on-site and off-site
   methodologies, the directorate was still confronted with four major problems. The limited
   and inaccuracy of the financial data provided by the financial sector required a higher
   level of analytical skills and acumen on the part of examiners; the grown demands on the
   directorate due to increased number of banks and financial institutions licensed to
   operate; limited capacity to supervise microfinance institutions; and as the number of



                                               28

   banks and financial institutions had grown, so too had the demand for Tanzanians with
   scarce banking skills hence the Directorate had lost some of its best people to the industry.
   A significant level of turnover was also expected to continue.

   11.     The effective functioning of the financial system depends on the efficiency with
   which financial transactions are carried out and flow of capital fund for investment.
   Modernising the payments system and development of capital markets are one of the
   important milestones in the development of the country's financial system.

   12.     Credit information on commercial, personal or microloans is a crucial matter for
   informed credit decisions. A feasibility study for a credit Information bureau financed
   under FIDP indicated that there was significant demand for the bureau. The study
   indicated that while a credit Information bureau can ultimately be profitable, the
   estimated start-up costs, representing initial capital spending and working capital
   requirements present significant barrier to entry. The project therefore intended to finance
   the establishment and management of a credit Information bureau.

   13.     The objectives of FIDP II were therefore commensurate to the needs and
   conditions of the country's financial sector at the time of its institution.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS

   Bank Restructuring and Privatization

   14.     NMB Privatization: Privatization of NMB took longer than expected due to long
   decision making process which necessitated several presentations to the Parliament and
   public awareness campaigns. NMB is one of the three off-springs of then National Bank
   of Commerce [NBC] that was split in 1997. NMB was incorporated under the National
   Microfinance Bank Limited Incorporation Act of 1997 as a commercial bank for
   promoting microfinance.

   15.     NMB started operations with a financing gap of more than TZS 84 billion; it was
   only issued a provisional license. Its financial condition was precarious, its operations
   were in bad state, it had staff who had no adequate expertise needed for modern
   commercial banking. The bank had to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with
   Bank of Tanzania giving it relief from certain provisions of the Banking Act. All these
   factors made it unattractive to prospective investors.

   16.     The Government had to restructure NMB in order to enable it deliver its promise
   and in order to make it attractive to prospective investors. Hence, the following were
   done:
   (i) The Government injected bonds amounting to more than TZS 92 billion in order to
        clear the financing gap of NMB;
   (ii) In August 1999, the Government put in place a management contractor to manage
        NMB and enable it to meet its objectives as a commercial bank-cum-microfinance
        provider with the intention of preparing it for an early privatisation;



                                                29

(iii)The Government undertook to finance NMB's systems improvement, training of
     NMB staff, modernization of its operations etc.; and
(iv)The Government funded various studies relating to NMB restructuring and
     privatisation.

17.     Under the management contractor and the restructuring efforts, NMB was turned
around financially and became profitable as a result it attracted respectable prospective
investors. After long process of privatization, finally 49% of the NMB shares were sold
to a Consortium led by Rabobank, and the bank was handed over to Rabobank
management team on October 1, 2005. The Government has now initiated processes to
sale the 21% of its shares in NMB to the public.

18.     In terms of performance and services, NMB is now well capitalised, meeting the
regulatory requirements and with better services. Micro-lending began in August 2000 in
8 branches and by the end of 2006 the number of lending branches had reached 111, with
about 190,000 loans outstanding. Loan portfolio outstanding had reached TZS 136.26
billion. Total capital had reached TZS 90 billion by end of 2006 from negative TZS 9.71
billion recorded in 2000. Total assets of the bank had grown to TZS 794.65 billion from
TZS 173.08 billion in 2000. During year 2006 the bank recorded profit after tax of TZS
34.45 billion as compared to TZS 1.93 billion recorded in 2000.

19.     Peoples' Bank of Zanzibar (PBZ) Privatization. The Government hired a
consultant in March 2001 to undertake a study of the performance and conditions of PBZ
and identify feasible restructuring/privatization options, among which Government of
Zanzibar (GOZ) would select one for implementation. In October 2002, GOZ approved
privatization strategy and in March 2003 an MOU was signed. The MOU set forth the
conditions under which BOT allowed PBZ to continue operations in a way which would
not further jeopardize the integrity of the financial system and put PBZ in a transition
mode until a credible investor has been identified.

20.     The Government also engaged consultants to undertake special audit, legal
advisory services and privatization advisory services. Retrenchment of 131 staff was
done in December 2006. The whole process of privatizing PBZ took longer than expected
due to long GOZ decision making process. For instance, in mid 2005, GOZ postponed
the process following the general elections. The process was resumed in March 2006 and
privatization process was expected to be completed in 2007.

21.     Tanzania Postal Bank (TPB). Privatization of TPB had not been very successful.
A diagnostic review and evaluation of restructuring/privatisation options has been
conducted and the report was issued in mid 2005. The Consultant's recommendation is to
privatise TPB by selling a majority stake to a strategic investor.

22.     Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB). The Government engaged a Consultant to
undertake a Diagnostic Review and Evaluation of Restructuring/Privatisation Options for
TIB in 2004. Having explored the options available, the Government made a decision to
transform TIB into a development bank. The process involves transforming the bank into



                                            30

a development bank for providing medium and long-term credits, increasing its capital
base from TZS 7.64 billion to TZS 50.0 billion and enhancing training on development
banking to the staff of the newly formed bank. TIB has requested funding under FSP to
engage a Consultant who will assist in determining on how best to transform TIB into an
effective and sustainable Development Financial Institution (DFI) and define the
parameters within which TIB may operate successfully as a DFI.




Capital Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA):
23.     The project financed public awareness programmes, capacity building of the
CMSA staff through various trainings and attachments to other authorities and office
automation including trading platform at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange.

24.      During the past few years access to the capital markets has increased. There
were about 40,000 investors at DSE in 2004 that increased to 97,000 towards the end of
2006. Taking into account the over 100,000 investors in Umoja Fund (unit trust scheme),
participation of Tanzanians in securities market almost quintupled since September 2004.

25.     The market value of securities also increased. For instance, market capitalization
had reached over TZS 900 billion for domestic securities by the end of 2006. The
increase in market capitalization is mainly explained by the increase in number of listed
companies. Going forward, preparations for NMB, CRDB and NBC listings are going on
ushering prospects for increased interest by the financial institutions to list at DSE.

26.     The debt securities have also registered marked growth with 7 corporate bonds
and 39 Government bonds. The total outstanding balance was about TZS 80 billion by
the end of 2006 for Corporate Bonds and around TZS 540 billion for Government bonds.

27.     The concerted public awareness programmes have lead to increased participation
in the market. The recent trend in the level of subscriptions for initial public offerings by
companies has been of record oversubscriptions. The DAHACO IPO in 2003 recorded
236.4% oversubscription followed by Umoja Scheme that was able to raise TZS 90.5
billion of which TZS 17.7 billion had to be refunded to investors. More recently, TWIGA
shares were oversubscribed by 300.5%.

28.     Automated trading platform has been implemented. The platform enables remote
access by dealers, and facilitates efficient clearing and settlement systems. It has also
facilitated link with other exchanges and the market watch system located at CMSA. The
launch of country wide Umoja Fund facilitated increased penetration to district level.
Commissioning of the Automated Trading Platform will further allow participation in
rural and remote locations as some brokers venture into upcountry locations.

29.     CMSA has just finalized a feasibility study on implementation of the Alternative
Investment Market Segment (AIMS or growth market segment). It is envisaged that the
segment will absorb the companies currently not meeting the listing criteria of the main



                                            31

market segment at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and provide opportunities for
riskier but potentially high return investments.       Implementation process will be
completed towards third quarter of calendar year 2007.

Insurance
30.    The project aimed at strengthening the Insurance Supervisory Department's (ISD)
capacity to regulate the insurance industry and to support the divestiture of the National
Insurance Corporation.

31.    The Government hired insurance advisor to work with ISD for a period of 14
months. The advisor assisted ISD in developing a risk based approach to insurance
supervision, proposed amendments to the insurance legislations, developed prudential
requirements for insurers and prepared proposals for reinsurance regulation. The Advisor
also conducted studies on establishment of dispute/complaints settlement mechanism for
the industry and introduction of self regulation of insurance industry market conduct by
the Insurance Institute of Tanzania.

32.    ISD staff and board members attended various training attachments and courses
aimed at strengthening the capacity of ISD to regulate the industry.          Supervisory
authorities to which the staff and members of the board were attached included Malaysia,
Mauritius, Kenya, Malta, Zambia, Egypt and UK.

33.    Privatization process of the National Insurance Corporation of Tanzania
Limited (NIC) started in may 1998 when it was specified. In order to develop an
appropriate strategy for privatization, a number of studies and assignments were carried
out. Following completion of these studies, a workable privatization strategy was
developed and approved. The approved strategy was to sell the NIC Life and non life
businesses separately.

34.    In order to prepare NIC for its Privatization, the Government carried out two
assignments; namely Diagnostic Review and Operations Study (Financial Audit and
Operations Review) and Market Review and Divestiture Options.

35.    The financial audit revealed major financial problems in the corporation. The
financial condition was poor and the performance had been deteriorating. The
Consultants found also that the record keeping at NIC was very poor and needed
immediate remedial action in order to accurately understand the financial condition of the
Company. The Consultants concluded that the trend of performance was therefore
characterized by decreased market share and liquidity problems and insolvency that led to
NIC fail to meet the solvency margin and other regulatory ratios required by the law. In
order to address these problems, the Government resolved that it was necessary to
address the accuracy of the records of assets and liabilities of NIC. It was also found
necessary that the liquidity problem be addressed by reducing the investment levels in
buildings through disposal of some of the assets.




                                            32

36.     The Government also engaged two Consultants to provide privatization advisory
services and legal advisory services. The privatization process gained momentum in 2005
when invitation of expression of interest was made worldwide through local and
international papers. 12 firms applied for pre-qualification on Life Business and 10 for
Non Life. On the basis of the strengths and weaknesses identified in the submissions, 8
firms were pre-qualified to proceed with the next steps of the bidding process for Life
Business and 7 firms for Non Life. Bidding documents were issued to pre-qualified
bidders and Pre-qualified bidders conducted due diligence on NIC from 3rd January to
19th March 2006. Bidders' conference was held from 13th to 14th February 2006. By the
deadline date (31st March 2006), two bids were received for Life Business and three bids
for Non Life. The financial proposals from the qualified firms/consortia were opened on
29th May 2006. PSRC conducted review of the financial proposals in line with RFP
requirements and valuation reports on the two businesses. The recommended bidders are
under review by the Government.

Pension Funds Reform
37.     The project intended to explore options for the appropriate institutional
arrangement for regulating pensions and feasibility of combining the regulation of
insurance with that of pensions under one regulatory body.

38.     The Government hired Consultant to carry out a review of the Pension Sector in
Tanzania and come up with an appropriate legal, regulatory and operational framework
for public and private sector pension funds; and rational order and logical mix or
otherwise of the existing pension funds, the laws and regulations to govern their
operations, and the appropriate body to enforce the regulations.

39.     The Consultant submitted a final report in December 2006, which contains a
range of options and recommended the option that they consider to be the most
appropriate to pursue. In the meantime, it has been deemed necessary to put in place an
interim regulator who will be mandated to regulate the existing pension funds during the
transition period, thus calling for additional work under the assignment. The objective of
the additional work therefore, is to assist the Government in establishing a regulatory
office to ensure that the existing pension schemes, while they continue to function in the
interim until such time as the new system is set up, are operated in a transparent and
arm's length manner to safeguard the assets and to seek to ensure members are treated
fairly.

Banking Supervision
40.     Under this component the project intended to strengthen the capacity of BOT to
supervise banks through provision of training to staff of its Directorate of Banking
Supervision (DBS) in the areas of supervision of problem institutions, on-site
examinations and methodology development.

41.     DBS staff attended various courses in-country and overseas relating to bank
supervision, such as risk management, money laundering, microfinance and risk based
supervision. DBS organised group trainings for all examiners on problem banks



                                             33

management, treasury risk management, credit risk management, financial innovations,
IFRS/IAS, risk based supervision and banking supervision information system. A number
of examiners attended attachment programs on risk based supervision to other
supervisory authorities including Uganda, Zimbabwe, Canada and India. The project also
funded cross border joint examination programs in Uganda and Kenya.

42.     Under the Project sponsorship and assistance from IMF East Afritac initiative, the
directorate developed risk based supervision methodology and conducted pilot
examinations under risk based supervision.

43.     With the assistance of the Directorate of Management Information System, the
directorate continued to improve its banking supervision information system. The system
is now capable of capturing information on other form 16 schedules and producing
various reports.

44.     The directorate in collaboration with legal services department reviewed all
regulation, guidelines and circulars taking into account new development in the baking
sector and in line with the new BOT Act, 2006 and BFIA, 2006.

Credit Information Bureau
45.     The project intended to finance, in conjunction with private sector shareholders,
the start-up costs required to launch the bureau with the intention that it would reach
financial sustainability within three years. The initial thought of having the bureau
established by the Tanzania Bankers Association could not bear fruits and therefore the
Government decided to change the strategy. In the new Bank of Tanzania Act, 2006 a
provision has been included which indicates that Tanzanian credit information system
shall consist of a databank administered by Bank of Tanzania and private credit bureaux
operating under conditions prescribed by Bank of Tanzania.

46.     In an effort to implement the acts requirements, Bank of Tanzania initiated
process of seeking the services of consultants who will assist in the creation of a legal and
regulatory framework for establishing, licensing, regulating and supervising credit
information bureaux; and for establishing credit information requirements at the Bank of
Tanzania. The two assignments are still going on under FSP and IMF funding.

National Payment System (NPS)

47.     Government mission of modernising the NPS commenced in the late 1990s
following the adoption of the NPS Vision and Strategic Framework 2005. The project
intended to fund the design of a modern and efficient national payments and clearing
system, including development of a comprehensive vision and conceptual design of new
payment mechanisms and preparation of detailed technical specifications for the national
inter-bank payments and clearing system.


48.     Several systems were conceptualised and designed with milestone set for them to
be implemented and become operational. All stated systems in the Vision have been



                                            34

implemented including the building capacity to the NPS staff on the dynamisms of
payment and settlement systems. Some of the activities under the implementation of the
Vision were funded under the project. The main projects were, Electronic Clearing
House, implementation of Electronic Data Interchange Facility, and implementation of
the Real Time Gross Settlement System known as the Tanzania Inter-bank Settlement
System (TISS). These projects underwent the conceptual design, the technical
specification and implementation stages. Other developments include the development
of NPS Legal Framework, NPS Oversight activities and Harmonisation initiatives.


49.     Government implemented the Electronic Clearing House (BOTECH) system at
the Dar es Salaam Clearing House. The system went live in March 2001. The BOTECH
system facilitates clearing of inter-bank debit obligations. Further developments include
the system linkage with the TISS (the RTGS system) to enhance the systems efficiency.
This interface is used to transfer clearing participants' net settlement figures from
BOTECH to TISS. The interface was done by the BOT internal IT staff. The project
provided technical assistance on implementation of these activities.


50.     Government implemented the EFT system and it went live in December 2004.
The EFT is implemented in the BOTECH platform where banks are now able to send and
receive EFT files in the Dar es Salaam Clearing House. The original plan of
implementing a secure electronic Data Interchange facility using a "Virtual Private
Network (VPN)" has been changed and will now use the SWIFT FileAct facility that
facilitates exchange of files over the SWIFT network for clearing house purposes.


51.     TISS went live in April 2004. TISS is real time gross settlement system that
settles continuously throughout the day high value and time sensitive payments. The
system has improved efficiency in the payments system by eliminating the settlement
time lag for high value and time sensitive payments. It also minimizes credit risks. The
System has been working properly since it went live with participants from the
commercial banks and the Revenue Authority.


52.     Bank of Tanzania has established an oversight department, which undertakes
several oversight functions in the payment systems. It is empowered by the Bank of
Tanzania Act, 2006 to perform the oversight activities. The oversight activities include
monitoring the systems, on-site examinations, self assessment exercises and periodic
reporting and assessment of the systems.


53.     Bank of Tanzania is a member of SADC payment system project and the EAC
payment system Harmonisation committee. In these regional groupings several
harmonisation and joint development programs are required to be implemented. Bank of
Tanzania has been working towards achieving these regional plans.

Credit Guarantee Scheme
54.    The project, though not included in the initial design of the project, funded
consultancy services for a short term Advisor to work in the Credit Guarantee Scheme
Project Management Unit (PMU) during its initial stages to enable the schemes perform
their duties more efficiently, transparent and accountable in line with best practices of
corporate governance; as well as providing guidance as to how such schemes can be
made independent and successful. The Advisor commenced work in September 2005 and
completed the assignment in December 2005. The Consultants recommendations were
implemented by Bank of Tanzania. Sensitization workshops were also conducted in the
four zones.

V.     OVERALL PERFOMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND THE BANK

Government Ownership
55.    The Government of Tanzania participated fully in the implementation of the
project. Bank of Tanzania implemented the project on behalf of the Government through
its Directorate of Banking Supervision. The Government's ownership of the project is
articulated in the following areas:
a) It participated almost in all stages of the project from project design up to
    implementation stage.
b) Privatization Committees and Steering Committee which were entrusted with the
    responsibility of overseeing the privatization of NMB and PBZ respectively
    comprised of members from the Government.
c) The Government through evaluation committees participated in the procurement
    processes for consultancy services and goods procured for different assignments
    needed for implementation of the project.

World Bank's Responsibility
56.    The main responsibility of the World Bank was to monitor and supervise the
project and review its progress to ensure that the proceeds of the project are used as
agreed and stipulated in the credit agreement. On its supervisory role the World Bank
was expected to:
a) Review and approve application for withdrawal of credit proceeds;
b) Respond to any problems or queries on disbursement issues referred to the Bank; and,
c) Conduct supervision missions to ascertain progress of the project.

57.    Applications for withdrawal were attended promptly and the World Bank
responded to problems as they arose during the implementation of the project. The level
of flexibility was encouraging as it was possible to extend the closing date three times
and allowed re-allocation of credit proceeds to different needy categories. Also it was
possible to include some new activities which were not envisaged in the original plan but
were considered important in meeting the objectives of the Project.

Institutional Arrangements
58.    The project was financed by IDA credit of US$ 27,500,000 (XDR 20,600,000).
75% of the credit proceeds were utilised. The overall implementation of project was



                                            36

coordinated by the Directorate of Banking Supervision. PSRC, NMB, ISD and CMSA
were also involved in the implementation of the project components falling under their
respective jurisdictions.

Quality/Quantity of Supervision
59.    The quality and quantity of project supervision by the World Bank is considered
satisfactory. There were close follow-ups of project activities and support was provided
whenever needed. Several missions were made and aide memoire reports were issued
which provided guidance in the project implementation.

VI.    SUMMARY

Findings
60.    The following findings were identified in the implementation of the project:
         The major factor which affected implementation of the project, especially bank
         restructuring and privatization which was the main component, was
         underestimation of time for long but unavoidable decision making process by the
         authorities including the Parliament.
         The privatization delays resulted in cost overruns to some project activities, such
         as NMB management contract and privatization advisors.
         The closing date of the project had to be extended three times to enable
         completion    of   project  activities.  However,    some   activities   remained
         unaccomplished even after the extended period.
         There were also some delays from World Bank in getting timely approval on
         procurement processes.

Lessons Learned
       Prompt decision making in implementation of projects is important for timely
       completion of project activities and for avoidance of cost overruns.
       Privatization of banks can be carried out only after having a solid and well
       defined legal structure; otherwise the process will definitely take longer than
       expected. This calls for adequate preparation of the mechanics of privatization
       before starting the process.
       Decision to privatize, especially after restructuring, is primarily a political one.
       Participation of stakeholders in the process is necessary for facilitating the
       privatization process.
       Although privatization of state owned banks is a cumbersome and politically
       sensitive matter, the outcome is worth the trouble.

Sustainability and Future Operations
61.    Some of the components financed under the project are now self sustainable and
some will only need limited support on capacity building. NMB is now self sustainable;
and CMSA and ISD are now meeting most of their operational costs.

62.    Some of the activities which could not be accomplished under the project will be
covered under the new project, Financial Sector Support Project (FSP).
