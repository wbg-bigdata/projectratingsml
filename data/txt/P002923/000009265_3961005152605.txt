UGANDA TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
FEEDER ROADS COMPONENT
SMALL CONTRACTOR EQUIPMENT LEASING
AND MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS
Project Objective and Strategy
I     One of the aims of the Feeder Roads Component of the Transport  iliion Projedt
(TRP) is to develop small domestic contactors to become fully  dependt prive business
concerns (after about 4 years). This would imply that they are well managed, tically
competent, dispose of a wel trained staff and own a substntial part oftheir ligh equipment Tbey
would then be able to continue doing road rehabiliation and periodic maintnance work competing
wnth other contractors, labor-based and equipment-based, assunung that contract conditions are not
bised agn  them. They would have established a track-record with a fin
instituon (FLI) I/ and would provide collateral as required to renew and gadually exand their
equipmet fleet. Their business would then become sustainable with a capacity for expansion
provided that there is a reasonable balance between demand and supply of contracting services. In
this connection, it should be noted that contactors using lWt equipment are more flexible as to
type and size of work they can undertake, while road contractors, using heavy equipment, can
expect to use their equipment only in full scale units for large road works.
2.    In order to reach the described stage of development, the contactors must have (a) gone
through the various training stages to be executed under the TRP; and (b) had a reasonable profit-
level which has enabled them to build up their business and, in particular, to have paid back on the
equipment so that they own most of their equipment fleets. To reach that stage within an effctive
3.5-year time fiame under the project, it is most likely that they would be required to go through a
number of evolutionary phases, described in some detail below. Te speed at which this can take
place depends, to a large extent, on mnro-conic fators (inflation and interest rates), the
contrctors perfomance, the eventual creation the Uganda Leasing Company (ULC) which would
specialize in leasing. Further infonnation on the actual conditions of engagemen of the FLI are
being finalized in consultation with the IFC and are expected to be firmed up by the Field Support
Technical Assistance team. This paper presents some of the issues and suggests an appmach for
implementing the leasing operations under the proposed project.
Conditions for Borrowing
3.    A pre-condition for the smooth development of a gradual capital formation on the part of
the contractors is the contractors' ability to borrow capital and lease equipment and be paid for
their services. Thus, particularly with high interest rates, payments of monthy saements must be
prompt. If the real interest rate (the difference betwee the interest charged and the inflation rate)
is large, it would also be highly relevant that contract unit rates are adjusted firly. With
appropriate adjustment (for price escalation) clauses in their contracts the contactors would not
f    'eTh proposed Leasing Company (ULC) will have to be linked with a local bank which will handle
progress payments, and also provide qualifying contractors with wodring capital if requird.

have to bear the foreign exchange risk. The emerging contractors should not be put at a
disadvantage vis-a-vis large established contractors using equipment-intensive methods who have
access to the international capital market.
The Step-by-Step Approach to the Operations
4.    It is clear that the development of domestic contractors cannot reach maturity without
reliable and sustainable access to financial credit on reasonable terms. What is less clear is how
and in which tempo this can be achieved. Under ideal conditions, this may be done in one step; in
Uganda, it is not likely to be feasible. The various potential steps in the process are briefly
described below:
Step I Purchase of equipment byMOLG under TRP (9 months). Equipment operated byMOLG
under TRP; training of contractors on the training site and in the classroom (6 months).
Step 2 Each contractor carries out rehabilitation work on 4 km-6 km test section with,fixed unit
rates  Equipment may be leased to contractors by the FLI on behal of the owner,
MOLG and operated by contractors provided the contractors are likely to participate in
future contracts. Equipment maintenance is the responsibility of the contractor who
could undertake the required maintenance at local, well run workshops (of their choice,
but preferably in Mbale and Tororo).
Step 3 Contractors carry out work on one-year contract (1S km-20 fcm) with fixed unit rates.
Contractor leases equipment procured by MOLG from the FLI under agreement with
MOLG to administer interest payment on equipment. Equipment maintenance would be
carried out by local workshop under contract with contractor. In addition, the
contractor should provide pay-back on the equipment, also administered by the FL. The
interest to be paid should either be the agreed rate for loans denominated in foreign
exchange, or a reasonable commercial interest on a USh loan. (See also para. 3).
Step 4 The contractors will bid on, and be awarded, a one-year contract With the leasing
operations envisaged the total contract period will have to be ideally 3 or 4 years,
subject to performance criteria allowing for early termination by MOLG. The other
conditions as above.
Step S The contractor could preferably opt to complete the pay-back on the equipment and
become the owner of the equipment. Preferably at the beginning of this step, the risk of
the equipment loan can be removed from the MOLG and taken over by the FLI who
would then have to cover its risk by an increased charge to the contractor. If the
contractor has established a good track-record over the previous years and the general
interest level has been reduced to a reasonable level this would seem achievable.
The Role of the Financing/Leasing Institution
S.    The role of the financing/leasing institution would be to ensure (a) efficient administration
of interest and pay-back on equipment rented by contractors on a hire purchase basis; and (b)
sound and efficient financial management of the contractor's accounts.



Appexnx 2.3
Pag 13 of 18
6.    List of Services: In order to ultimately fulfil this role, the FL! should provide the following
semvces, some of which belong to later stages of the project (pam. 4):
(a)    equipment procured by MOLG to be inspected by the FLI to confilm nat al
specifications and contractual conditions have been fulfilled;
(b)   screeaing ef contractors' credit worthiness by applying a set of evaluation criteia
agreed with MOLC- or its representatives, e.g., the Project Management Team;
(c)    developmet of appropriate loan a  s  between the FLI and the contctos
applying conditions of repaymet approved by and acceptable to MOLG-,
(d)    upon the siare of loan agremens, handing over of equipment to cotators
together with signed condition inpecion certificate;
(e)   regular monitoring of the conditions and utilization of the equipment and the
financi  performance of the contractors as to their credit worthiess, taking
appropriate legal action in case of najor delinquencies;
M     recovery of loan (payback) and interest payments in accordance with conact
areement and crediting payments (on behalf of MOLG) to fte FLI-mana_d
revolving fund which may be used for on4ending to future contactors;
(s)    exeting paymts for works exewted to contacs, based on payment
rificates issued by the MOLO, applymg a sound banking system  and
mainuain  records for each of the constuction f ins, showing relevant conta
and lease  emnent, gross and net payment assessmnents and balance of loan;
()    assising contactors with their accounting and financial managenot by providing
unsellng and technical guidance; and
(i)    opening and maintaining a revolving fund account accring interest and providing
regular statements for this account (see (1) above).
7.    Suggested Expertise and Services: It is expet  that dte financing/leasing institution
will have on its staff the nonnal banking expertise of manager acuntn, clerks and othes with
requisite truning and experience. However, in order for the insutn to undertake the role
defined in paas. S and 6, it must have on its staff or have regular access to the services of: (a) a
project analyst to evaluate the contro rs; credit worthiness, their needs for assistance, etc.; (b) a
_me    a engneer to inspect equipment on receipt from MOLG and ovesee equipment
utilization and adequac of equipment maintenance; and (c) a civil engineer to liaise with
contators on construction issues. The expertise in (b) and (c) could be provided by the Field
Support TA teamn.
8.    Reporting: The Fll should provide (a) regular and up-todte statmen  on all financial
matters, and (b) regular reporting on all other relevant matters. The following reporting schedule is
prpoed:



Appenlix 2.5
Page 14 of 18
regular and up-to-date statements of the TRP recovery account to be provided at
least once a month;
provision of quarterly loans and interest financial statements for each contracWr as
well as a combined statement for all contractors;
an inception report covering the management and services to be provided should
be submitted 2 months from the beginning of the assignment;
half-yearly reports on the performance of the contractors;
a completion report at the end of each loan agreement and a summary report when
all loans have been recuperated.
9.    Responsibilities of MOLG: The MOLG through the Engineering Department will:
-     provide regular and continuous work to the contractors during the entire period of
loan recovery;
-     purchase the required hand tools, light equipment including a set of essental spare
parts and employ the FLI to manage the leasing and financing operations after
assuring that the equipment is in order and according to requested specifications;
-     submit names of the contractors recommended by the MOLG for lease of
equipment;
-     submit a detailed list describing the amount and type of equipment to be provided
to each contractor;
-     ensure that all checks based on payment certificates are issued in the joint name of
the contractor and the finance/leasing institution until fuUl loan recovery has been
achieved.
Selection of Finance/Leasing Institution
10.   A number of investors, among whom is the Development Finance Company of Uganda,
will establish a leasing company - The Uganda Leasing Company (ULC). The ULC appears the
most likely to be functioning by project effectiveness. A Feasibility Study Report on the Leasing
Company was completed in May and concluded that favorable conditions existed for leasing
operations in Uganda. Pending the resolution of some outstanding issues regarding the enactment
of legislation for leasing, the Road Traffic Act, etc., the formation of the leasing company will
facilitate the arrangements suggested above. The major shareholders are expected to include (i)
Development Finance Company of Uganda, (ii) Grindlays Bank (Uganda) - to be renamed 'Stanbic
Bank of Uganda" (iii) International Finance Corporation, and (iv) Commonwealth Development
Cooperation, and (v) Standard Bank of South Africa, and (vi) Nile Bank. An IFC mission in
association with representatives of these institutions appraised the Company proposals in
September 1993. The findings of the appraisal mission confirm that the ULC will participate in
the leasing operations for small contractors once it is operational by the Fall of 1994. It is
proposed that the ULC will grant eligible contractors full payout (otherwise known as finance)
leases the durations of which should be the same as the period of contracts those contractors have
from the MOLG.
Operation
11.   It is appropriate that the proposed Leasing Company designates a Project Appraisal Unit
to deal with the MOLG on all issues of the labor-based conators. The Unit should be reporting



Appendix 2.5
Page is of 18
to a joint FLI/MOLG Standing Committee. The committee should comprise the Chief Engineer of
the MOLG, the Project Coordinator and Local Project Manager, The Director of the Leasing
Company's Unit and its operational officer.
12.   Some functions of the Unit:
(i)    All correspondence between the Leasing Company and the MOLG on the labor-
based contractors should be with the Unit.
(ii)   List of beneficiary contractors will be submitted to the Unit which will arrange for
their appraisal.
(iii) Equipment from MOLO will be received by the Unit and issued to the contractors
after appraisal and approval.
(iv)   All payment checks issued by the MOLG for joint payment will be presented to
the Unit first. The Unit will then inform the contractor of the amount for loan
repayments and the remaining balance which will be released to him. On
conclusion of this negotiation the Unit will then instruct the Branch of the
Financing/Leasing Institution where the contractor keeps his account to release the
agreed amount.
13.   The labor-based contractors should be encouraged to forn an association. Common issues
likely to cause misunderstanding between the contractors and the Financing/Leasing Instiuon can
be brought before the MOLG/Leasing Company Standing Committee for settlement. The
contractors will be represented by the executive members of this association. The aim is that
doomestic contractors should, at the end of the project, be able to own a major part of the required
equipment and not continue to rent for ever.
14.   All issues between the MOLO and the Leasing Company needing clarification will be
settled at the Standing Committee level.
Terms of Loans
15.   The MOLG is responsible for assessing the amounts due to each contractor at every stage
of the contract period. Checks for the completed works are issued by the MOLG in the joint name
of the contractor and the FLI (the local bank) to ensure that no other bank has access to the check.
When the check is cashed the FLI can gradually recover the loan by securing an agreed portion of
the amount as a repayment of the loan. To ensure that this arrangement is followed, the FLI must
establish procedures so that only the unit responsible for the contractors are authorized to handle
the checks, avoiding that the entire amount of the checks are cashed and no repayments are made to
the equipment loan.
16.   Repayment Period: The repayment period should be in the range of 4-6 years depending
on the amount of the equipment provided to the contractor. (See Annex A for equipment
amorfization example)
17.   Security: The Leasing Company may require a security from the contractor which should
be agreed initially. It is, however, expected that the equipment provided under the project will
serve as sufficient security.



Appendix 2.5
Page 16 of 18
18.   Interst Rata: The MOLO and the Leasing Company must agree upon an appropriate
level of interest rates for the equipment loans. The rates take due account of the rumning expenses
of the Leasing Company for the management and handling of the loans, existing interest rate level
in the country, inflation, exchange rates between local currency and foreign currencies (US$). A
certain amount of the generated interest should be channelled back to the MOLO revolving fund
account to cover losses.
19.   Restrictions on Usage: Equipment financed under the loan should be used solely for the
purpose of the Project, and shall not be used for any other purpose except with the authorizaton of
the MOLG in consultation with the Leasing Company. Only after a certain period of time or after
the contor has completed a certain amount of works will he be released and be free to use the
equipment on other assigmnents. This period should at least cover the project period. However,
the MOLG must guarantee that it can prowde regular and continuous amount of work during the
bonding perod.

EQUIPMENT AMORTIZATION
Introduction:
I.    In the estimates of the cost of rehabilitation it has been assumed that the contractor's
equipment would be filly amortised over an average time span of 6 years. In the Annex, yearly
amortisation has been estimated based on an interest rate of 12% p.a., all figures being in US$.
The cost estimate was based on a contractor's administration/profit/risk at 30% of direct cost
(including taxes and duties). Assuming that administrative costs are half of this, or 15% of direct
costs, it is seen that on an average one-year contract of US$ 260,000(20 an rehabilitation at US$
13,0001km) the contractor would have a yearly profit of US$ 30,000. In case the equipment is
amortized over a 3.5 year period, corresponding to the effective project period, it is seen that the
contractor would need to invest his entire profit in paying back on the equipment on the assumption
that the contractor uses US$ 30,000/year on contract administration. In this way, after 3.5 years
with about an additional 2.5 years life for the equipment the contractor would have reached the
stage described in para. I of the main text. As an alternative, the contractor could stretch the pay-
back period and, in parallel, deposit excess profit in an income eaming account in the FLI.
2.    In July 1993, at project appraisal, the exchange rate had (since mid-1992) remained almost
constant at US$ 1.00 = USh 1,200.00 while the interest rate had dropped from about 45% p.a. to
25% p.a. This interest rate is still high for lending in US$ and may not be attractive to contractors
takdng loans in US$ at that rate. Interest on loans in hard currency would have to carry a more
modest interest but would have to be subject to a considerable risk of devaluation.
Assumptions:
Cost of all equipment for one contractor
including taxes and duties                            US$ 257,840
Average full rehabilitation contract
including taxes and duties                           US$ 13,000/kmn
For one-year 20 kan contract
- taxes/duties                                 US$ 40,000
- administration/profit/risks                  US$ 60,000
(of this admin. US$ 30,000)
- base cost excluding taxes/
duties                                      US$ 160,000
- interest                                     US$ p.a.

TRANSPORT REEHABIUTATION PROJECT
UGANDA RAILWAYS CORPORAIION
List of Priority Investments
1.    As seen from the financial analysis and projections, URC has to be very cautious in
effecting capital investments in view of the depreciation burden and the tight financial
outcomes in the near future. Based on this strict principle, and subject to each individual
project being econonically and financially evaluated and justified, a list of investments which
are likely to qualify has been prepared. These are aimed at achieving improvement in URC's
competitive edge, in covering unavoidable arreras of maintenance, andlor based on safety
considerations.
2.    Ferry OverLauls: A cycle of major overhauls on the lake ferries will be due during
the Project period, and IDA assistance has been planned under the Project.
3.    Radar for ferries: This requirement is based on safety considerations.
4.    Triangle at Port Bell & remodeling of Kampala Marshalling Yard: With the
commissioning of Port Bell, there has been a change in the pattern of operations, with (a) a
requirement of turning the wagons on arrival from the ferry owing to the uni-directionally
oriented coupling arrangements, and (b) a shift in the shunting workload from Jinja to
kampala, albeit with a projected reduction owing to the increasing number of block trains.
The work is currently being managed with make-shift arrangements, with attendant
repercussions on wagon utilization. This is proposed to be rectified by the provision of a
triangle at Port Bell, and minimal remodelling at Kampala.
S.    Strengthening of the Nile Bridge: This bridge on the main line was inspected by
Consultants in 1992, and based on their recommendations, repairs and stengthening measures
are required on safety considerations.
6.    Mechanical handling equipment: URC's marketing thrust will require provision of
this equipment at the modal interfaces. The specific items will have to be justified on an
individual basis, after the marketing policy is streamlined and finalized with the help of IDA-
funded Technical Assistance.
7.    ACIS - Phase U: Under the first Railway project, the basic ACIS (Advance Cargo
Information System) wagon tracking module has been installed on URC. This needs to be
followed up with the Phase II module to enhance the MIS capacity of URC, to improve its
capability to compete effectively in the transport market.



Appendix 3.3
Page 2 of 2
8.    Road Motor Vehides: These are intended for maintenance support to improve
efficiency in the engineering departnents. Replacements for currently operative vehicles and
future replacement needs will have to be found from URCs own funds generated from
depreciation provisions.
9.    Lake Tanker. The traffic projections indicate that there is likely to be the need for
additional ferry capacity in 1998, when one ferry will need to be dedicated to POL transport.
The choice between a wagon ferry and a tanker vessel will have to be clearly analyzed and
evaluated, takdng into account the initial cost, the operating and maintenance costs, the effects
of the projected extension of the Kenyan oil pipeline to kisumu, the projected enhancement of
bulk oil storage capacity at Mwanza as well as the split of the product between the entry ports
of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. An indicative provision has been shown under this item.
10.   Tank Wagons: URCs potential to compete in the profitable jet fuel market remains
unutilized for want of the specially lined tank wagons, and the interface arrangements needed
for traner of the product from kampala to Entebbe by road. URC would be embarking on
tis investment only after (i) confirmation and commitment from the oil companies, (B)
simultaneous provision of the interface transfer arangements at Kampala is ensured and (iii) a
detailed evaluation of the profitability and rate of return is carried out.

1.    The Uganda Railways Corporation Statute of 1992 enjoins on the Uganda
Railways Corporation (URC) to become a self-supporting, autonomous, commercially
oriented parastatal entity. With this formalization of its legal status, URC has embarked on
a major restructuring exercise, based on a Core Corporate Plan (CP) and a Financial
Restructuring Plan (FRP). The Government of Uganda (GOU), as the sole shareholder in
the Corporation, is clearly defining the contractual relationship between GOU and URC in

the functions of the department have to be enlarged and sharpened to include financial
analysis, realistic and accurate budgeting and cash flow management, close monitoring of
collection of dues, debt management, cost and profit center-based accounting and review,
and investment analysis and evaluation. For this purpose, URC intends to obtain external

TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT - REPUBLIC OF UGANDA
Draft Terms of Reference for Transport Economist
1.    General: Under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP) to be undertaken between July
1994 and June 30, 2000, it is intended to further strengthen the Transport Planning capacity of the
Planning Department (Transport) {PD  (T)} of the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications. Previous technical assistance projects of the World Bank and the UNDP in the
transport sector have focused on training in economic appraisal and computer based transport
problem solving.
2.    Objectives of the Technical Assistance: The PD now is characterized by a reasonable
level of analytical capability and the TA is designed to (i) raise the capability of PD staff by
f.trther on the job training in their transport economics assignments within MOWTC and (ii)
supplement their skills in the fornulation of policy in certair, key areas such as:
* the monitoring of the relationship between road tax and the costs of the road sub-sector given
possible significant changes to the financing of road expenditure during the life of the TRP;
* the restructuring of the Uganda Railwvays Corporation into a commnerically oriented parastatal
with increasing financial autonomy;
*  the policy and framework for negotiations betveen Government and parastatals when
Govenment directs parastatals to engage in activities which would not nonnally be undertaken
on a commercial basis;
*  the development of an urban transport policy in the light of work undertaken by the PD and
under the First urban Project; and
*  other issues that may arise in the course of implementation of the TRP.
3.    Reporting and Intermittent Service: It is intended to provide a total of twelve person-
months of intermittent input in the atea of transport economics to the PD over the life of the TRP.
4.    Qualifications and Experience of the TA: The TA will be an experienced transport
economist with at least 10 years, involvement in the analysis of transport issues and the
formulation of transport sector policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. The TA is also expected to have
worked on issues concerning the various transport modes. His capacity to effectively transmit his
know-how to the PD staff will be major consideration. The TA should be fluent in both spoken
and written English, and have a working knowledge of current computer programs in use in
MOWTC/PD.



Appendix 4.2

Draft Terms of Reference for Technical Assistance to
National Transport Data Base(NTDB)
1.    General: The NTDB was established in 1987. It is located in the Planning Division of the
Ministry of Works, Transport and Communications. Its objectives are (i) to provide MOWTC with
the data it requires to r.-anage the ministerial functions of formulating, coordinating and monitoring
trsport policies in Uganda. and (ii) to serve as the central point in Government where transport
data are being collected and stored for use by all interested parties.
The NTDB staff has built up a reasonable level of capacity to collect and store data, and
manage them in the form of a set of files organized according to the FoxPro data base system; this
capacity was built up with the help of technical assistance, most recently under project
UGA/90/018, the UNDP-financed, World Bank executed Transport Policy and Planning Proiect,
which will close on January 31, 1994. The data base management system is now operating, but the
Ugandan staff capacity needs further strengthening while the data base also needs further
improvements to retain it as an up to date and relevant infonnation source.
2.    Objectives of the Technical Assistance: In order to enhance the NTDB's usefulness to its
users both inside and outside MOWTC, a systematic approach has to be introduced to identify
additional data requirements. Simultaneously, customer interaction with the data base needs to be
failitated. Thirdly, the trained personnel needs to get fully confident in its management of rigorous
and timely updating of the files under the intermittent guidance of the technical assistance.
Technical assistance will in general be used to provide hands-on training in order to consolidate
and strengthen the data base management skills of the Ugandan staff. More specifically:
(a) it is proposed that three times a year, new areas of data should be identified on the basis of
indications obtained from MOWTC and outside users.
(b) in order to make the NTDB more user-friendly, a program should be designed and
implemented that will control file use through a menu, first for access only but to be followed
by data editing and report generation facilities. The technical assistance will also explore other
means of serving more customers better, including possibly through an information point in
KCampala.
(c) in order to create a sustainable data base of professional quality, the structure of the
database in its present consolidated form on Foxpro and the data held within that structure
must be maintained. One of the Ugandan staff should become the data base manager who
would be in charge of the records for all the data base files and the data base structure in
general.
(d) transfer of know-how would be effected by a series of seminars to the data base personnel
covering theoretical data base techniques such as file design and data base management. in
addition, practical hands-on sessions will need to be given on progammming in data base
laguages.



Appendix 4.2
Page 3 of 3
3.    Reporting and Intermittent Service: The TA should start his assigmnent with an
inception mission of four weeks resulting in a inception report, including a detailed workplan. This
should be agreed with the Chief Transport Economist in MOWTC. Thereafter, the TA would
provide 22 months of intennittent services in Uganda, divided possibly in 4 periods of about six
months each, spred over the duration of the Transport Rehabilitation Project. A one month
termination mission would complete the TA input.
4.    Qualifications and Experience Required: The TA should be highly qualified and
experienced in the use of computers, including experience in data base designs and in
programming of data base languages, in particular dBase or FoxPro. The TA should have both
theoretical knowledge and practical experienve in transport economics, including statistical and
analytical work. He/she should be fluent in both spoken and written English. The TA's capacity to
effectively transmit his know-how to the PD staff will be a major consideration.

UGANDA
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES AND DOMESTIC
1'RIVATE CONTRACTING INDUSTRY
A. MOWTC
General
1.01   As a result of the merger of the Ministries of Works and Transport and Conmmunications
MOWTC has a wide tange of functions. It is responsible for policy formulation and execution (or
supervision of execution by others) for all transport and communications activities, with te exception of
rural feeder and community roads. Its responsibility covers both infiastructure and transport services. A
major part of its work concerns the planning, programming and actual execution or supervision of
construction and maintenance of the classified road network (called "main roads network" in this report).
MOWTC is the parent ministry to five parastatals, namely: the Civil Aviation Authority, the Uganda
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, the Uganda Transport Company, the People's Transport
Company and the Uganda Railways Corporation.In additiur, MOWTC comprises the Transport
Licensing Board, and supervises the National Transport Safety Council. In a 1993 reorganization,
MOWTC was divided into two directorates: Engineering, and Transport and Communications. lhe
Engineering Directorate is responsible for road maintenance and strengthening, upgrading and
regravelling/rehabilitation activities. The Road Maintenance Division in the Engineering Directorate,
headed by a chief road maintenance engineer/assistant commissioner, is responsible for the upkeep and
maintenance of roads. Responsibility for road maintenance is distributed over 21 MOWTC maintenance
districts. At MOWTC headquarters, the chief road maintenance engineer is assisted by six principal
engineers, one for maintenance planning, one for contracts and four for field operations (one each for the
Northern, Eastern, Central and Western areas). Transport Planning is one of the functions of the
Transport and Communications Directorate, and is undertaken in the Planning Division which also houses
the National Transport Data Base.
The Transport and Communications Department
1.02 This department consists of 3 units: Surface Transport, Aviation and Planning. The Planning
Unit is headed by the Chief Transport Economist, and generally carries out socio-economic studies
needed for formulating transport improvement and development policies. It is responsible for the overall
preparation, appraisal, evaluation and monitoring of all transport development policies including those of
the parastatals affiliated to the ministry. The division also carries out project write-ups of all modes of
transport and communications sectors. There are three sub-units on: (i) regional sub-sector programme;
(2) monitoring, appraisal and evaluation, and (3) National Transport and Communications Database.
The latter is responsible for the collection and tabulation of all relevant data on transport and also for
carrying out transport field surveys and presenting data required for transport policy fomulation. The
Planning Unit is receiving technical assistance under the UNDP financed World Bank executed Transport
Policy Planning Project.



Appendix S.1

Engineering
1.03    The maintenance section of the Engineering Directorate is responsible for upkeep and
maintenance of roads. Responsibility fo; maintenance of the road network is divided into four
geographical areas, each headed by an area engineer stationed in Entebbe. Each area in turn is divided
into a number of maintenance districts; there are currently 21 districts performing road maintenance
functions. At the Ministry's headquarters, the chief road maintenance engineer wvho heads the
maintenance sectioi is assisted by two senior executive engineers, one for the Eastem and Northem areas
and the other for the Central and Westem areas.
1.04 The mechanical section of the TD is responsible for the repair and maintenance of vehicles and
plant of all Government ministries/departments, and is headed by chief mechanical engineer located at the
central workshop in Kamnpala. Under the central workshop, there are four area workshops (at Kampala,
Mbale, Gulu and Fort Portal) and thirteen district workshops. While the central and area workshops
handle major overhauls/repairs for vehicles and plant, the district workshops take care of light repairs and
routine servicing. About 70% of the overall workload in MOWTC workshops relates to road
maintenance vehicles and plant. As a result of the looting caused during the 1979 war, a large amount of
the workshop equipment was damaged beyond repair. The Third Highway Project assisted with
supplemnentary workshop equipment and tools to help upgrade the maintenance and repair capability of
MOWTC workshops. In addition, it provided for the needed repair/reconstruction of most of the
workshops.
1.05  The MOWTC has a well equipped material testing laboratory located outside of Kampala. The
Laboratory not only provides testing services for the MOWTC, but also provides such services to other
Government agencies and private firms on a charge basis. The laboratory headed by a chief materials
engineer, is divided into four sections: soils, bitumen, concrete, and chemical.
1.06   Staffing and Training: The MOWTC is understaffed; several senior and middle management
positions, as well as lower posts at the headquarters and in the field, are vacant; the vacancy rate is
particularly high (40%) in the road maintenance section. At the Ministry's headquarters, one of the 2 key
positions of principal executive engineer is vacant, and in the field 7 positions (377%) of executive/civil
engineer, 34 positions (41%) of engineering assistant of various grades, 20 (67%) positions of road
inspector of various grades and 15 positions (28%) of overseer are vacant. Similarly, there is a shortage
of mechanical staff, notably mechanics and plant operators. Furthermore, the majority of personnel lack
the qualifications and experience necessary for efficient task performance. The Govenmnent low salary
scales often make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified and experienced personnel. Given the
country's difficult economic situation, the issue of low level of salaries of staff can be addressed over the
medium term within the overall Government administrative policy. In the meantine, the impact of
staffing shortage will be alleviated by providing technical assistance to MOWTC to help improve road
maintenance planning and operations.
1.07   Currently, there are three ongoing MOWTC technical assistance (TA) programs: (i) TA under
the UNDP Transport Policy and Planning Project; (ii) TA funded by EEC which includes, among others,
a transport economist for highway planning; and (iii) TA as part of the eastern Uganda road maintenance
program (EURMP) funded by KfW. The TA programs at (i) & (ii) are scheduled for completion by
January and July 1994. The KfW EURMP provides for 186 man-months of TA inputs from July 1992



Appendix 5.1

thru December 1995. In addition, the EEC 3-year Initial Action Program (lAP) for road maintenance
(January 1994 thru December 1996) in south-western Uganda and the ODA 5-year gravel road
rehabilitation and maintenance program (January 1994 thru December 1998) in western Uganda each
envisages a 5 map TA team to run their respective programs.
1.08   The training section of the TD is responsible for training activities of the MOWTC. The
MOWTC's road maintenance training center (RMTC) at Kyambogo, just outside Kampala, has class-
room and on-the-job facilities for training of road maintenance personnel (road inspectors, overseers and
headmen); separate facilities exist within the central workshop for classroom instruction and on-the-job
training of mechanical staff (foremen, plant operators and mechanics).
1.09   The MOWTC also draws on the resources of external training facilities such as Makerere
University and the Uganda Technical College, located just outside Kampala, for training of its staff. The
university offers courses leading to a Bachelor's degree in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering; the
yearly intake of students varies from 60 to 65. The college offers courses leading to ordinary
diplomahigher diploma in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering. It also offers a technical teacher
tining course, and has residential facilities for about 600 students. Besides, there are a number of
technical secondary schools in the country providing craftsmen/master craftsmen training to secondary
school leavers, and 4 vocational training institutes/centers run by the Directorate of Industrial Training
under the Ministry of Labor. The Vocational Training Institute, Nakawa and the Vocational Training
Center, Lugogo are located just outside Kampala, while the other two: the YMCA Vocational Training
Center and the Jinja Vocational Training Center are located at Jinja. The courses offered at the
vocational training institutes/centers are automobile repairing, machine fitting and assembly, welding and
fabrication, carpentry, brick laying, etc. The training facilities in the country are adequate in size for the
foreseeable needs of the MOWTC.
1.10   Engineering and Construction: The design section of the Development Dvision carries out
minor road and bridge design including field investigations, while detailed engineering and economic
feasibility studies for major projects are done by foreign consultants. There are a few local private
consultants in the country, but they are generally involved with structural design. The established
standards and specifications for road works are generally acceptable.
Major construction works financed by outside agencies are awarded following prequalification
and international competitive bidding, and are supervised by foreign consultants. Much like other sectors,
the road construction industry in Uganda is suffering the consequences of disruptions in economic
activity, and is currently at 10-20% of the pre-1974 capacity. There are some 10 medium-sized and a
number of small domestic contractors who have been engaged in minor road upgrading and periodic
maintenance works, but they lack proper equipment, management expertise and trained manpoNver to
perforn effectively and profitably. Nine domestic firms received classroom and on-the-job training under
the pilot program for development of the local construction industty, included in the Third Highway
Project; however, due to the lack of funds/equipment, coupled with Government delay in releasing
advance payments, the program achieved limited success. To provide local construction industry with
access to plant and equipment, Government wishes to rent out equipment to contractors (see para 3.17)
and establish a plant hire pool by July 1, 1995, if leasing and private equipment pools do not provide an
effective solution. Funds for short term consultancies to help its introduction are provided under the
project. The Nakawa Management Training and Advisory Center, located just outside Kampala, has



Appendix S.1
Page 4 of 13
prepared proposals for special courses to address the training needs of managers of medium size
construction companies.
1.11   Road Maintenance: MOWTC's road maintenance organization is basically sound, but because
of staff shortages, the lack of trained nunpower and paucity of funds, the quality and quantity of road
maintenance is unsatisfactory. Routine maintenance is carried out sporadically; periodic maintece has
not been undertaken on a meaningful basis since early 1970s. During FY89, FY90 and FY91, the total
road maintained was 120/o, 25% and 26% of the classified road network respectively. Table 5.1.1 shows
anmual force account road maintenance carried out during FY89 - FY92.

1.12   The funds allocated/released by Government for road maintance are far below the
acal needs of the road network. Table 5.1.2 shows the budget allocation vis-a-vis amounts

1.13   As of end-December 1992, the total equipment fleet for MOWTC comprised 1,094 units,
including 396 units of light/support equipment and 698 units of heavy equipment and plant. Of these,
349 units (32%) we-e 5 years old or more, 462 units (42%) 4 years old, and the remaining 283 units
(26%) were 3 years old or less. According to the MOWTC, about 65% of the equipment is in
saisfiactory condition; the rest is in poor to very poor condition. Due to the insufficient local funding
and/or bureaucratic delays, MOWTC is unable to procure fuel, lubricants, fast moving spare parts and/or
tires for day to day operations of equipment. A large number of equipment units thus remaui idle; the
equipment availability rate is about 30%.



Appendix 5.1

1.14   Following recommendations of the National Road Maintenance Awareness Seminar held in
Uganda in February 1992, Govermuent has expressed its willingness (i) to establish a Road Maintenance
Fund to resolve the problem of inadequate funding of road maintenance; and (ii) to consider an
autonomous Road Authority to free the management of the road network from the civil serce
bureaucracy. A Road Authority/Road Fund study to be financed by GTZ will be undertaken from May
to December 1993.
1.15 As recommended by the February 1992 Road Maintenance Awareness Seminar, Government has
decided to cany out all future manual routine road maintenance and periodic road maintenance (road
resealing/regravelling) by contrct Mechanized rouffne road maintenance operations and works of
emergency nature, however, would be carried out by force account, on a task basis. Govemment has,
as of January 1993, started manual routine road maintenance on some 2,500 km of rehabilitated road
using contract lengtuman system (on a one man per 2 km basis), and has set up road maintenance
accounts, with an initial deposit for 4 months, in each of the 21 operational districts to expedite
disbursements. No mechamized routine road maintenance is currently planned due to shortage of funds.
1.16   The KfW is currently assisting Government with a 3 1/2 year program (July 1992 thru December
1995) for maintenance of 659 km of road in eastern Uganda. The ODA plans to finance a 5-year gravel
road rehabilitation and maintenance program (January 1994 thru December 1998) for 1148 km of road in
western Uganda, and the EEC aims at maintining the roads recently rehabilitated under EEC financial
assistance and associated feeder roads (a total of 2,046 kan) in south-western Uganda over a three year
period (January 1994 thru December 1996). The ODA and EEC programs have, however, not yet been
firmed up.
1.17   The project includes a 4-year (FY95-98) road maintenance program identified by the consultants,
and covers 1,952 km of primary road network, comprising 812 kan of paved road and 1,140 kan of gravel
road. This progran to be supported by the Association would represent about 1.16 percent of the total
road maintenance program and would be implemented in parallel with the maintenance of the roads
beingfto be maintained under the ongoing KfW ERRM and the proposed EEC and ODA programs.
1.18   According to the road maintenance study carried out by consultants Louis Berger Intl, the
countrywide yearly requirement of recurrent funds for road maintenance (basic maintenance on priority I
& 2 roads and 'minimal' maintenance on priority 3 roads) is US$37.43 million, with a foreign cost
component of US$27.2 million. Against this, thie donor (KfW, EEC, ODA & IDA) funding is expected to
be of the order of US$15 million per annum leaving a financing gap of about US$22 million, *%ith a
foreign exchange component of US$12 million. Based on the consultants' report, the EEC and ODA
programs are under budgeted.
1.19 Road Safety: Promotion of Road Safety would deserve much more effort than it presently
receives in Uganda. The 1970 Traffic and Road Safety Act, currently being amended, gives the National
Road Safety Council (NRSC) the responsibility to coordinate all road safety activities, informn and
educate the public through the press, campaigns, schools and literature, and advise the Government on
measures to be taken. NRSC reports annually to MOWTC. Lack of public funding and limited success in
raising private support have reportedly severely limited actual NRSC activities. Improved funding and
adequate reporting by the police on accidents, fatalities and injuries is needed to improve and maintain



Appendix 5.1
Page 6 of 13
solid basic data, established earlier in the National Transport Data Base in MOWTCtPD, on which
analysis and recommendations for inproved infrastructure and behavior of traffic participants could be
based. The partial information available suggests that traffic accidents are on the rise, that personal
injuries alone cost in the order of 1-2 percent of GDP to the economy, and that most of them are
concentrated in the Kampala area. Both drivers and vehicles have to pass tests to receive a road license.
Also, third party liability insurance is mandatory and required to obtain a road license. The use of safety
belts nor motor helmets is compulsory. Speed limits are often not observed nor enforced. These facts
show that there is much room for improved regulations and more systematic enforcement of existing ones,
wvhich would depend on better traffic police training and remuneration to be introduced over time.
l OWTC tries to include accident reduction features in its road design and in improvements at black
.dots; MOWTC would for example like to pave road shoulders where this could help move high levels of
pedestrian and cyclist traffic off the carriage-way. With improved problem analysis, it could undertake
more effective action.
B. MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT: GENERAL
1.20   Through the Urban Authorities Act 1964, the District Administration Act of 1967 and various
administrative procedures, the national government exercises considerable control over the financial
management of local authorities. MOLG has primary supervisory control over council finance and is
responsible for:
(a)  Allocation of block grants to councils;
(b)  Establishment of financial policies and directions through budgetary control procedures;
(c)  Review of monthly financial reports prepared by councils;
(d)  Inspection and audit of council development plans;
(e)  Establishment and enforcement of council accounting practices;
(f)  Appointment (by the Minister) of city, municipal and towvn Councilors, in cases where the
minister decides that Councilors will not be chosen by elections;
(g)  Management of the Local Authorities Loan Fund.
While in theory MOLG has an important function in supervising and enhancing local authoritv
financial management, its role in practice has been largely ineffective because of serious lack of trained
management and technical staff, equipment, supplies, transport and budget allocations. In 1987, GOU
enacted the Resistance Councils and Committee Statute to decentralize power and foster political as well
as administrative accountability on all levels of governments. The official launch of the decentralization
programme in October 1992 announced far reaching changes, especially in the revenue and budget fields.
Starting FY94, district votes included in the national budget and each District Executive Secretary uzill
become the accounting officer for his District. A new local Government Statute will be formulated to
redefine the powers of the Minister of Local Government. All functions (except securit%. national
planning, defense, imrnigration and foreign affairs) will be devolved in phases to local ukits of
administration based in the District Resistance Councils. The Ministry of Local Government and the
technical ministries will issue regulations and set up an interdisciplinary inspectorate to carrv out regular
inspections of services, and regular financial and performance audits wvill also become mandatory.
1.21    The development and maintenance of feeder roads are already onc of the mandatory
responsibilities of District Adrninistrations (DAs) under the District Administrations Act of 1067 They



Appendix S. 1
Page 7 of 13
should in principle finance the activities from their own various revenues and central Government grants.
During the 1960's and early 1970's, the DA Works Departments' maintenance of feeder roads were
generally adequate. This system collapsed in the late 1970's and district activities practically stopped. In
this situation, and as a temporary measure, MOLG through its Engineering Department, widened its role
and took over responsibility for planning and implementation of rehabilitation works, while the DAs were
expected to manage routine maintenance.
1.22   Organizational Structure of the Engineering Department: The Engineering Departmnent (ED)
is the principal MOLG department for feeder roads planning and execution. Its new organizational
structure is defined in the Rural Feeder Roads Strategy Paper (Appendix 2.15). Under the responsibility
of the Chief Engineer, it would consist of eight divisions: Planning, Monitoring and Design (PMD);
Rehabilitation (Construction); Maintenance; Training; Mechanical services; General services; Urban and
Buildings. The first five which concem mainly rural feeder roads, will on a day-to-day basis be managed
by a District Support (Rural Roads) Engineer under the overall direction of the Chief Engineer.
1.23   The ED is inadequately staffed and its offices are complttely inadequate to fulfil its functions.
The GOU agreed that the ED should be strengthened and the staff working environment should also be
improved. The GOU is actively taking steps to fill some of the established positions in the ED.
Currently, the Acting Chief Engineer is supported by three civil engineers and one mechanical engineer at
the head office. In addition, nine civil engineers have been assigned to various ongoing government and
donor-funded projects in the field (JICAI, GTZ, UNDP/UNCDF, ILO, IFAD/DA and IDA). Other TA
to be provided in the field or at headquarters for the proposed ABD Road Maintenance Project, DANIDA
Norther Uganda Reconstruction Project (NURP) and IDA TRP will be assigned in accordance with the
agreed structure of the ED. The need for a Training Coordinator at MOLG has been confirmed with
MOLG and GOU will actively seek to fill the position, if necessary with donor-funded TA. The position
which is to be provided at headquarters is expected to be closely coordinated with other training programs
organized in the Local Government Resource Center (LGRC, also the Uganda Management Institute).
1.24   The objectives of strengthening MOLO would, inter alia. be to ensure that:
i.  feeder roads projects and feeder roads and rural transport activities are carried out
effectively with comprehensive documentation on project physical, engineering, economic,
financial and social aspects;
ii. responsibility for project execution is gradually transferred to the respective districts; and
iii. planning of feeder road development and rural transport is based on engineering and
economic criteria aiming at overall cost-efficiency, and at the same time optimizing the use
of locally available resources (unemployed and underemployed labor, local contractors,
local materials, etc.), thus saving foreign exchange and enhancing employment ge.eration.
In order to achieve the above objectives, MOLG shall, inter alia, work in the following areas:
a.   Setting up systems and procedures for district-executed feeder road inventory and condition
surveys, overseeing their implementation at the national basis and updating them at regular
intervals.



Appendix 5.1
Page 8 of 13
b.   Setting up systems and procedures for effective district routine and periodic maintenance,
initially in the four project districts to be transferred later to other districts on a national
basis.
c.   Setting up systems and procedures for selecting feeder roads for spot improvements or full
rehabilitation; and providing assistance to the project districts in implementing these
systems and procedures.
d.   Setting up systems and procedures for the implementation of feeder road improvements in
the project districts.
e.   Coordinating training and demonstration activities in order to build up capacity at district
level to implement road maintenance and rehabilitation works, mainly through local
contrctors. Coordinating also (i) the training of local contractors and (ii) provision of
assistance to private workshop development.
f.   Building up a data bank in MOLG on all the above activities in terms of physical,
financial, economic and social parameters.
The proposed PMD is expected to carry out a major part of the above tasks (a,b,c and d). The
other taslcs will provide useful information for planning, however, they can be handled more suitably by
other divisions of the Engineering Department. Economic appraisal and evaluation of projects will be
camed out in close collaboration with the MOLG Plamiung Department. In the national context for
transport policy, strategy, classification and budgeting, close collaboration and infonnation sharing will
be necessary, between MOLG and the Ministries of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), and
Works, Transport and Communications (MOWTC).
C. DISTRICT ADMINISTRATIONS AND THEIR WORKS DEPARTMENTS
1.25   The four project districts - Kapchorwa, Mbale, Pallisa and Tororo - represent four different
levels of implementation capacity: Technical Staff and Organizational Setup, Building Facilities,
Equipment (for roads construction and maintenance, workshops and offices) and Financial Resources.
Financial aspects are discussed in greater detail in Chapter VI of this report.
1.26   Existing Technical Staff and Organizational Set-up:  The District Works Departmnents
typically have three sections under a Supervisor of Works, i.e. Administration (including Mechanical),
Buildings, and Roads Suctions. A typical Organizational Chart is shown in Appendix 2.17. The
established posts in the District Works Departrnents for Road Works are: Supervisor of Works (SOW),
Assistant SOW (ASOW), Foreman/Engineering Assistant for Roads and Bridges (F/EA), Road
Inspectors (RI), Drivers/Operators (dtO), and Mechanics (Mech). No district has a substantive District
Engineer, apart fiom an Executive Engineer who is stationed at Mbale for the Pilot Rural Roads
Maintenance Component of the IDA lVth Highway Project. Each district reported having a Supervisor of
Wors (SOW), and Pallisa has an ASOW position filled as well. Of the other positions, Kapehorwa had
one F/EA while Mbale and Pallisa had 2 and 4 RIs, respectively. Only Kapchorwa also reported having
one mechanic and a mechanical artisan (welding, etc.) at post. The other positions were all vacant.



Appendix S.1
Page 9 of 13
Appendix 2,17 presents the staffing situation for all sections in the four districts. Staff presendy
employed in the Works Departments are underpaid and their motivation has decreased because of low
activity/investments, lack of facilities and equipment to carry out their work satisfactorily. With the
reduced activity in the feeder roads sector in Uganda over the last decade (except for donor assisted
rehabilitation projects), the availability of engineers and technicians with sufficient managerial and
technical experience to fill the vacant posts is low. Employment in the public sector, especially in the
districts, is no longer attractive due to the low wages. Many of the ASOWs, foremen and road inspectors
are above 50 years old, hence, within a few years there will be the need for a new generation of
technicians to take over from themn. This will require active training and district level recruitnent.
1.27 Existing Office, Storage and Workshop Facilities: The Works Department in Zapohorwa
located next to the District Administration in the town center, has 92 m2 office area but no stores or
workshop. Part of the office space is presently used as storage rooms for hand tools. There is no yard or
fencing around the office building which is in need of maintenance and minor repairs.
1.28  The Works Departmet of Tororo District Administration is located in approximately 2.25
hectares of land close to the city center. The yard which was built in 1967, is enclosed with chain-link
perimeter fencing and a security post is provided at the entrance. Buildings and other facilities provided
in Tororo are: (i) an office block of approximately 150 m2 floor area containing 3 offices; (ii) two
byuildings serving as an office for the ASOW (Buildings) and drawing office, while the second is used as
a fuel and lubricants store; (iii) a workshop and stores block of 1050 m2 floor area with three store rooms
for storage of timber, cement and a general store for hand tools used in roadwork. The timber store and
general store are each of approximately 375 m2 floor area while the cement store is about 50 rn2 in floor
area Within the timber store there is an imer store of about 40 m2 floor area. The stores and office
buildings are in fairly good condition but are in need of minor repairs to the fencing, electrical
installations including security lighting, and repair of water connection. All buildings should be painted
and a soils laboratory needs to be established possibly at the location of the present fuel stores.
Other facilities include a carpentry workshop equipped with band saw, plane and thickness
machine, all in various states of disrepair, and a mechanical workshop, of approximately 450 m2 floor
area with an inspection pit. Unserviceable equipment in the shop also includes an engine crane, a
hydraulic press, a bench lathe and a drill press. Leading off the workshop area are the foreman's office,
spare parts store, battery charging room and a compressor room. The battery charger and compressors
are also unserviceable; and underground storage tanks for diesel and petrol fitted with fuel station-type
electric pumps on site have not been used in nearly a decade.
1.29   The District Administration Works Department at Mbale has similar facilities as those described
above. The Works Department yard is located in the westem outskirts of Mbale city. The buildings were
constucted in 1965, but have been refurbished under the IDA-supported Pilot Project. There are two
office blocks of 164 m2 and 51 m2 respectively, a carpentry workshop (300 m2) and stores (300 m2).
The buildings are in need of some repairs on the roofing and some painting of the walls. The mechanical
workshop, which has a floor area of 525 m2, has facilities to carry out minor repairs on equipment and
vehicles, though the number of workshop tools is limited.
1.30   The Admisation in Pallisa district, being a very young district, is most inadequately equipped.
The Works Department does, except for a tiny office, not have any facilities at all.

1.31   Existing Equipment: In the four project districts inadequate fiuding has caused shortages of
essential road works equipment, spare parts, hand tools, implments, office and workshop equipment and
supplies. An overview of the roads equipment available in the four districts is presented in Table 5.1.3.
Kapchorwa and Pallisa do not have any equipment at all. During the IDA supported Pilot Project one
wheel loader, aoe mntor grader and two tipper lorries were made available from other districts and are
listed under Mbale district All the equipment is olc, and frequent break downs occur. The capability in
the Works Departnt for manting any size equipment fleet is presently very limited, due to the run
down workshops.

1.32   Under the IDA-supported Pilot Project which forms part of the Fourth Highway Credit some road
constructions and maintenance equipment and workshop tools worth about US$300,000 will be
purchased in FY94. This will facilitate an early statu of the training of contractors under the proposed
Project.
1.33   Workshop equipment: Mbale Works Department has purchased a compressor, a thicknesser a
ripper, and a planner (carpentry) in 1990 and these machines are all in good condition. Tororo has a
planner, a ripper and a mclder which requires some repairs. Apart from the welding plant included in the
table above none of the districts have presently any mechanical workshop equipment other than old
scrapped machines.
1.34 Office equipment: The office equipment available is almost negligible. The Work Departments
rely on the scarce facilities available in the District Administrations.
1.35   Hand tools: Some hand tools were procured for road rehabilitation and maintenance under the
IDA supported Pilot Project. The nmnber of hand tools available in October 1992 are listed in Table
5.1.4.

D. DOMESTIC PRIVATE CONTRACTING INDUSTRY
1.36   Twenty one domestic contractors have filled in a questionnaire providing details of their
management and technical staff, equipment holding, financial situation, work experience, turnover, etc.
Fourteen of the contractors were interviewed and Appendix summarzes the interviews and provides in
tabular form an overview of contractors' responses. All contractors showed interest in the labor-based
feeder roads project. The few who own substantial amounts of equipment, however,, expressed doubts
about the feasibility of labor-based methods and indicated their preference for equipment-intensive
methods. Nearly all the contractors have previous experience in building construction using labor-
intensive methods, and at least four also had experience in road construction using mostly * quipment-
intensive methods. Most of the firms are directed by one or several (Civil) engineers who deal with all
management aspects of the business. The permanent staff is limited to an absolute minimum and the
majority of the "key staff", including in some cases the managers, ire often full-time civil servants who
are caUed upon as needed.



Appendix 5.1
Page 12 of 13
1.37   Most of the contractors with road works experience had received training under ID)As Third
Highway project. The training was carried out by the Superfos consultants/contractor and was limited to
equipment-intensive methods using bulldozers, graders, front-end loaders and heavy rollers. The trained
contractors had subsequently only had occasional work and most appear now to be financially weak. The
interviewed contractors with road experience stated that they had not been able to amortize their
equipment because of inadequate earnings, and would not be able to replace obsolete or inoperable
equipment.
E. UGANDA RAILWAYS CORPORATION
1.38 The Board: URC's legal status as a parastatal entity is defined in the Railway Statute of August
1992. This provides for a nine member Board of Directors, headed by a Chairman with seven other
directors and the Managing Director. All the members of the Board are to be appointed by the Minister
responsible for railways transport (MOWTC), from among persons having knowledge and experience in
commerce, transport, finance, industry, administration or engineering. The Managing Director is a full
time manager, and is appointed by the Minister (MOWTC) on the recommendation of the URC Board of
Directors. The term of office is three years for all Board members and four years for the Managing
Director.
1.39   Management: The Managing Director has seven major department chiefs (Marine, Finance,
Commercial, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Construction and Administration) reporting to
him. In addition, the Signaling and Telecommunications, Planning and Internal Audit sections and the
Public Relations and Security units report to him. The organization chart of URC is at Appendix 3.4)
There is a highly centralized management structure, and delegation and accountability are conspicuous by
their absence. The corporate culture is also predominantly department-oriented, rather than corporation-
oriented. Both ficts result in the M.D. having to intervene in day to day matters, and in delays and
operational inefficiencies. With a commercially oriented URC, as it will have to become in order to
survive and succeed and succeed in a competitive environment, the corporate culture will need a radical
change, and management of this change will be an activity vital to the success of the proposed project.
The M.D. will need experienced assistance and advice to manage this process, as well as full cooperation
from the Board and MOWTC, the present ministry. The Project aims to provide this component.
1.40   The three Engineering Department (Civil, Mechanical and Signal & Telecomins.) are manned by
personnel competent in their technical fields; they have also benefited from technical assistance provided
in the past by bilateral donors and through the recently concluded Railway Project. The managerial levels
are manned by qualified technical graduates. The weak departrnents, in relative performance terms, are
(i) the newly formed Conunercial department, which includes the erstwhile Traffic department. and (ii)
the Finance department, which hitherto, has been perforning mainly an accounting function. These
departments will need technical assistance and training to help them perform their critical ro:-s in the
restructured URC. The other weaknesses are (i) the Supplies Dcpartment, where a basic computerized
supplies management system is currently being installed, and (ii) the Personnel Department, especially in
the Manpower Development function. Short termn assistance may be needed in these two areas in the
course of the project.



Appendix S.1
Page 13 of 13
1.41   Staff: URC has succeeded by its own efforts to bring about a large reduction in its workforce
from 7280 in 1987 to about 4200 currety, by a system of selective redundancies and payment of
compensation, in consultation with the Trade Union. The reduction is continuing. During the proposed
Project, URC would enforce strict limitations on fiesh employment, introduce more incentive schemes and
strengthen task-onented supervision. In addition, URC is exammig the subject of undtking tack
mainteance by contract. The target for the staffing levels will be agreed upon with URC as part of the
agreement on the Core Corporate Plan. The expert Advisers being engaged under the Project will assist
URC in the preparation of detailed Acbon Plan to implement the Corporate Plan.
F. AlR TRANSPORTATION
1.42   Uganda is in the process of fomalizing its air transport policy. Its practice has been in recent
years to encourage more carriers, intemational companies as well as small argo companies, to come to
Entebbe, the international airport. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) was established in 1991 to
operate both as an aviation and an airports authority. It reports to the Minister of Works, Transport and
Communications, through a Board of mainly private sector members, which supervises the executive
level: managing director, corporation secretary and five directors. A sizable UNDP-financed, ICAO-
supervised team of experts is assisting CAA and training its personnel in many tasks; the project is
supposed to be completed in 1994. CAA collects revenue directly from landing rights and navigational
services to overtflying aircraft. CAA sets its own fees and salaries. CAA does not receive fiancial
support from the Government, but has to finance on the contrary the downpayment for the Spanish loan
for the rehabilitation of the terminal building.
1.43   Operational requirements and safety considerations prescribed a program of works prepared by
consultants in 1991. This was followed by a Twenty Year Aviation Master Plan completed in July 1993.
These studies have shown the urgent need for improvements in infrastructure and equipment.
Navigational aids and the runway repairs are CAA's highest priorities, but no clear financing offers have
been received. Meanwhile, terminal building repairs have begun in 1993. All safety-related activities
were supposed to be completed during the lifetime of the UNDP-financed project (1991-1994) but they
have not been forthcoming.
1.44   Uganda Airlines (UAC) is a 100 percent Goverament owned public corporation. Its Board
contains mainly non-private sector members. Although UAC used to depend on Government subsidies to
meet its payroll, that is not currently the case, thanks to the fact that UAC eams income from its small
flying operations but in particular from its monopoly of handling planes, freight and passengers at the
airport. If CAA were to liberalize these services, this would adversely affect UAC's finances. UAC owns
only one plane, a Fokker F27, and leases planes from other regional airlines for East African flights.
UAC is reportedly seriously considering a lease-purchase of a freighter or combi plane for a service to the
Middle East. As a subsequent step UAC hopes to buy a 19 seater for domestic flights in 1994, inter alia
to facilitate tourist travel within Uganda. UACs lack of a capital basis, and the fact that the Government
cannot at this stage afford to recapitalize its national flag carrier make these plans uncertain.

UGANDA
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS: LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND URC
Financial Analysis of Local Authorities
1.01   Background: There are two types of funds available for LAs: (i) emenues gerated within
the distict, e.g., grduated tx, market dues, v4ous fbes and licenses; and (ii) allocatons of fimds
from the central GOU anmual budget that are eannarked for LAs such as the block grnts traditionally
aimed at the social sub-sectors, budget support for rural feeder roads mait ce, and prject-specific
fimds managed by MOLQ.2D1  Revenue and expendiue estimates for the four project districts for
1990/91 through 1992193, are shown in Appendix 2.18 and they show tht:
(a)  Revenue esates exceed actual funds raised, roughlybyafactor 13 to 1.8;
(b)  expenditures closely match actual revenues, as a reflection of the LAs' low credit rats
and impossibility to obtain bank loans.
1.02   Graduated tax: is an important revenue source for the district LAs acnting for bet
65% - 80%. Ihis tax is based on LA-level assessments of individuals perceived asset base and/or
mcome. The schedule provides for eleven tax levels ranging from USh 1,000 p.a. to USh 30,000 p.a.
However, the districts report that most collections are in the under-USh3000 bracket.
1.03 Move to privatize Market Dues and Rents: Market dues and rents are the major component
of fies and licenses, the second most important source of revenue. Reduced volumes of economic
activity, corrupt collecdon practices, ineffective monitoring  stms and seasona}ity of receipts (tlh
rainy season acts as a depressant) were reported as having a negative effect on totat incom firm this
particular source in the past. However, all four districts bave either already leased out this function or
intend to do so begining 1993/94, with the primary objective of reducing collection costs and
leakages. So far, the experience has been positive, e.g., Tororo reported market revenues of UShl4
million in the first 7 months of 1992/93 (compared to a total of about USb2O million in 1991/92)
without any associated collection costs.
1.04   MOLG/ED General: From 1990/91 to 1992/93, GOU acta  recurrent expenditure by
MOLG/ED ranged from USh344 million to a high in 1991/92 of USh1240 million. Development
budget allocations have increased from USh8O4 million to USh3004 million mainly for donor co-
financed rural feeder roads projects. The current funding capacity of the LAs is considered inadequate
for their needs, and results from a combination of the economic recession and relatively low incomes
prevailing nationwide, the tight monetary situation in GOU, as well as under-collection ratms in the LAs
estimated as between 30°/1o50% of potential revenues.1
At the same time, under-collection of GOU tax revenues is reported at about 50% of
expected revenues. This issue is to be addressed by the proposed Tax Authority which has a goal
to progressively increase central tax revenue collection from a present level of about 7% to about
16% of GDP.



Appenix 5.2
Page 2 of 6
1.05   Block Grants: are povided out of the annual GOU recurrent budget through MOLG to the
LAs so as to bridge gaps in the LA budgets especially with regard to the social sectors, e.g., health,
education, etc.. In practice, the grans are applied at the discretion of the respective LAs. Over the past
two decades, and in step with GOU Is worsening financial sitation, block grants have declined to less
than 10% of total revenues in most LA budgets.
1.06   Other GOU support: to the districts which includes items such as support to feeder road
matace  or essental drugs were not detailed in the annual LA esmates of revenue and
expenditure. However, as a result of recent reviews, this GOU assistance wil be reflected in the
annual estima from 1993/94 onwards.
1.07 Local Authority Loan Fund (LALF): has been moribund since the latter 1970s, hence its
absence from the list of reveme components in Appendix 2.18. Originally established as a vehu4e for
low-cost GOU development funds to be on-lent to the LAs for capital projects, the LALF has not
opeated since 1978 due to cessation of inflow of GOU financing. This has had a negatiwve effect on LA
development financing.
1.08   The Budget Process: he formuation of annual recurrent and capital budgets for the Local
Authorities (LAs) including the four project districts is theoretically a 'bottom-up' process. The
entities involved include the District Resistance Council (DRC); and the District Development
Conmmttee (DDC) which comprses the District Executive Secretazy and the heads of Treasuty,
HEealt, Education and Works. The DDC is responsible for compiling different sections of the budget
and consolidatig them into a total budget within the Treasuy's estumates of expected revenues in the
fiscal year. The budget is then submitted to the DRC for approval before it is sent to the MOLG. In
MOLW, hspectorate reviews the vanous LA budgets and makes recommendaons to the Minister on
the draft consolidaed LA budget requet to the Ministy of Finance (MFEP).
1.09 The present budge system suffers from a lack of skills at both LA and MOLG levels, in
budget preparation, objective prioritization, reporting and monitoring of and acconting for
expdir. This phenomenon has contributed to inefficient use of existing resources and in the past
has been one reason for MOFEP not incresing resources to the LAs.
1.10   GOU intends to decentalize twelve districts on a pilot basis (which include Tororo and Mbale)
as self-accounting entities from the 1993/94 Budget onwards. The other districts will also be devolved
on a phased manner in the following years. This firther emphasizes the need for support to the
districts in organizing, budgeting and executing their various functions including feeder road
maintenance.
1.11   Proposal to Increase LA Funding for Feeder Roads: One of the proposed project actions is
to encourge the districts in effective organization and funding of feeder road maintenance. Therefore,
the project financing plan expects the four project districts to contribute towards the cost of rural feeder
roads maten ce. Several institutonal and social issues wil, however, need to be addressed in this
respect in all four project disticts, varying only in degree of intensity. They are described below.
1.12   Sub-optimal rural feeder roads maintenance: In 1990/91, the concept of assising Local
Authrties in route road maitenance was introduced in the recurrent MOLG budget which provided
for wages of one road porter per kIlometer of feeder road (under item 3040). The respective LAs were



Appendix 5.2
Page 3 of 6
supposed to contribute matching funds to total two lengthnen per kilometer. However, most LAs
(including aU four project districts) did not contribute any funds for this purpose, citing inadequate
income. Tlhe main drawbacks of the present system are: (a) available funds spread thinly over entire
district networks; (b) treatng lengthmen permanent LA staff to be paid year-round regardless of output
and the seasoa nattrre of routine maintenance work; (c) delays in paying road porters, which
undemine morale; and (d) inadequate guidance and monitorng by the Works Departments, given lack
of transport and the extent of the district networks. These factors have diluted the effectiveness of the
present rural feeder roads maintenance programs. As a result, many rehabilitated roads have fallen
back into disrepair and become inaccessible.
1.13   Accountablty Systems:  Existing accobility frameworks have weak monitoring,
reportng and enforcement. The MOLO has taken several steps to improve accountability in the
districts partly as a result of lessons lear during the 1992 audit carried out by the USAID-sponsored
program for rural feeder roads maiatenance. These included: (i) requiring several countersignatures (of
the DES, Treasurer and the Supervisor of Works) on checks sent from MOLG; (ii) payment to road
porters by sub-county chief in the presence of RC officials; and (iv) return of payment vouchers (duly
signed or thumb-printed by the recipients) to LA headquarters with copies to MOLG.
1.14 As a condition for negotiations, the four participafing districts will be required by
Government to submit proposals for action programs to raise the collection efficiency of District
revenue beginning In the 1993/94 budget. The action plans will include proposals for improving
reenue mobilization and for establishing appropriate accountability frameworks.
URC Finances
1.15   Generad: Since the bacldog in accounts has been eliminated during the IDA-suppored
Railways Project, URC is producmg conventional profit and loss statments, balance sheet, sources
and application of funds as well as an annual budget regularly, although still with some delays.
Auditing ofthe accounts causes additonal delays. Auditedfinancial statements for the last year 1992
have been submitted by URC The auditing of the Project account for 1992 is in progress and is
expected to be completed in December 1993. Audited accounts for 1993 and subsequent years will
be submitted to IDA within 6 months of the end of the calendar year.
1.16   Operating Performance: After the increase to nearly to 500,000 MT in 1990, a decline in
firegt volume set in. Revenue from freight seriices reflected this decline, but overall USh revenue
was kept up by proceeds from locomotive leasing to Kenya and tariff increases. In US$ equivalent
revenue underwent a slow and steady erosion. Expenditures first reflected increasing mamtenance
levels, then stagnated, while depreciation moved permanently to a higher level as a result of a
comprehensive revalhation in 1990. The outcome was: deteriorating working ratios and operating
ratios in 1992compared to 1989 and sizable operating deficits since 1990. (See table 5.2.1)

1.17   Transuarencv of Accounts will need to be improved in two respects: the tenrs and conditions
under which assets procured by GOU and handed over to URC should be incorporated in URC's
c-aital structure, which would determine any repayment obligations from URC to GOU as well as a
clearer basis for fiuture cost calculations. For this same purpose, the capital assets acquired with donor
funds should be recorded in an orderly manner in the Assets Register. Secondly, the amount of donor
financed recurnt eMpnditure will need to be specified on a regular basis, and distinguished from
URC resources, so that the true operating deficit can be established. The Memorandum of
Undersiand&ng between GOU and URC would cover these issues.
1.18 PayroDl: Salaries and Allowance continue to claim a relatively small proportion of
expenditurws. Incentive payments for essential services were increased in 1990, but could not be kept
on the same level because of budget deficits. The URC management has been quite successful in
bringing the staff complement down to 4,200 by the end of 1992, and has financed severance payments
out of its own means.
1.19   Tariffs: URC's new statute allows it to raise tariffs to meet increased costs pending the
approval of the Minister, MOWTC. URC has so far raised its tariffs infrequently because of trucking
competition in the market. The installation of the OSCAR system in 1993 pernitted MOWTC to
calculate somewhat better estimates of railway costs. 'Te aggregate running expenses are about
UShlOO per tonne-km.
1.20   Accounts Receivable: As of December 31, 1992 accounts due totalled USh8.3 billion. Over
85% are at least 3 months overdue. Important debtor are (a) CMB, PMB and Transocean wiich
together assumed TRC's debt to URC (40% of debt over 3 months): (b) the oil companies. A dispute
over a 15% commercial transaction levy is delaying payments. UTC is not exemnpted and therefore
charges the oil coinpanies 15% CTL, whereas road trasorters are exempted. IDA has requested



Appendix 5.2
Page 5 of 6
MOFEP to eliminate this distortion in competitve conditions (16% of debt over 3 months); and (c)
Government ministries, mostly longstanding debt (10% of debt over 3 monfts). Although reduction of
the claims outstanding was specified in IDAs Emergency Action Program Plan (EAP) with URC,
recovery has sic   As a result, URC's cash position is seriously constrained. IDA is continuing to
monitor the E4P until June 1994.
1.21 Financial Forecasts: 'Te URC finacial projections for 1993-1998 (excluding grants and
donations) shows margially decreasing operaing deficits throughout in UShs, resulting from revenues
growing at 8 percent per annum or slightly faster than expenditures (about 6 percent per annum).
Marine services continue to provide more than half of the revenue, but earnings from rail services,
which means domestic traffic and the Kampala-Kasese and Northern Lines are shown as improving
over time. This needs to be carefully analyzed because both lines are a priori lossgiving propositions.
Leasing of locomotives is projected to bring in considerable earnings throughout the period (see table
5.2.2), but this hinges on continued poor performance of KRC and KRC leasing locomotives from
URC.
