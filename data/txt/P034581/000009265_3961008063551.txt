MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO UKRAINE
FOR A HOUSING PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to Ukraine for the equivalent of US$17.0 million to help finance a project for housing.
The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen years,
including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent in US dollars with a spread
of one percent per annum to the Cities of Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa on the Bank's standard terms and
conditions.
Country/Sector Background
2.           The housing sector in Ukraine is undergoing a gradual transformation from central
planning and government allocation to increased reliance on private initiative and development of a
housing market. Prior to the start of housing privatization in 1993, over 60% of the housing in urban
areas was owned by local governments or state enterprises. The government constructed apartment
buildings and allocated the units to families on the official wait list. Management and maintenance of
the apartment buildings were carried out by municipal housing management enterprises which relied
on government subsidies because tenants paid only notional rent for their apartments. Subsidies for
housing, water, heat and other utility payments were estimated to be around 20% of GDP in 1993.
However, the system has not been able to provide adequate housing: over 2.1 million families (or
about 18% of the households) were on the wait list for housing in the urban areas, there was limited
flexibility to adapt housing in line with needs (younger people with growing families were not able to
move to larger apartments or older people with grown children to smaller ones), state owned
apartments were of poor quality because of poor construction and lack of maintenance.
3.           The housing sector is a critical element in the transition to a market economy and will
play an important role in the development of the Ukrainian economy. Increased private ownership of
housing and household involvement in selection, management and maintenance of housing will
contribute to the reduction of government subsidies which will impact on the government budgetary
deficit and overall macro economic stabilization. Development of a housing market will support
growth of industrial and commercial enterprises by allowing for divestiture of state owned housing
and facilitating labor mobility. Growth of a real estate market will allow for greater flexibility in
constructing offices and other commercial buildings in urban areas. Housing can provide an attractive
investment for households and provide motivation for savings. Finally, cramped quarters and poor
quality of housing are seen by the people as one of the more visible shortcomings of the central
planning system. Better housing will provide evidence of economic reform.
4.           Housing privatization was one of the earlier reforms implemented by the government.
The Law on Housing Privatization was passed in 1992 and became operational in 1993; as of
September 1995, over 30% of eligible apartments have been privatized. In June 1995, the legislature
approved the government's Housing Policy Concept Paper which advocates a market based approach
to housing development with the government playing an enabling role in the housing sector,
promoting the development of housing finance systems, encouraging growth of private construction
companies and targeting government assistance to low income families. The Concept Paper provides
a broad framework for sector development, but specific policy measures still need to be formulated.
At the local level, several reform-oriented city administrations have piloted land auctions, organization
of homeowners associations and contracting out of housing management and maintenance, with



- 2 -
technical assistance from USAID. The project is targeted to support these reform oriented city
administrations.
5.            A market for real estate is slowly emerging in the urban areas. Privatized apartments
are being legally transacted and real estate brokers have emerged to service the needs of those
wanting to sell or buy apartments. Some housing construction enterprises have begun to construct
housing for sale, responding to cutbacks in government funded housing construction. However, the
market still remains limited, constrained by lack of a financing system to provide long term loans for
housing purchase or construction, limited access to land for housing construction in urban areas, and
complex government regulations.
6.            Development of the housing market is an integral part of the transformation of the
economy and the sequencing of housing reform will depend upon progress on the overall economic
reform and stabilization program. Key elements of a housing market, such as a housing finance
system, can only be developed after a reduction in inflation and domestic interest rates. Similarly, the
development of private housing construction and building materials enterprises will be part of
enterprise privatization. The Bank is supporting economic stabilization, enterprise privatization,
financial sector development and land reform through a series of ongoing and proposed projects.
Therefore, the emphasis in this initial project is on smaller pilot activities which will: (a) demonstrate
market based approaches in lieu of state housing; (b) develop the regulatory and policy framework for
the operation of a housing market; and (c) lay the basis for future Bank projects.
Project Objectives
7.            The overall objective of the proposed Housing Project is to support the development
of a housing market to meet the housing needs of the people of Ukraine. Specifically, the proposed
project aims to: (a) foster private ownership of housing and fully privatized apartment buildings by
selling all completed apartments to city residents; (b) promote resident take-over of the management
and maintenance of their buildings through formation of homeowner (condominium) associations; (c)
encourage the growth of private housing developers by providing access to land with infrastructure
for housing construction and simplifying building regulations; (d) pilot competitive bidding in
selection of contractors; and (e) further housing reform through policy studies.
Project Description
8.            The project is a pilot which will support reform oriented city administrations in their
efforts to institute housing reform at the local level. In order to participate in the project, the city
administrations agreed to sell completed units (as opposed to allocation to families on the wait list),
continue the land auction program to increase developer access to urban land, review and simplify
land and building regulations, and select contractors through competitive bidding. The project will be
carried out in three large regional cities, Kharkiv, Lviv and Odesa, over a three year period and will
include:
(i)    Completion of the unfinished municipal housing (about 1,000 apartments) for sales to
households in Lviv and Odesa (US$16.7 million). Construction on municipal housing
has stopped or slowed down significantly due to lack of funding. The completed
buildings, originally intended for allocation to families on the wait list, will instead be
sold with costs fully recovered from sales proceeds, a major departure from past
practices.



- 3 -
(ii)    Provision of off-site infrastructure to develop serviced land (approximately 15.2 ha.)
for sale to private developers for housing construction in Kharkiv and Lviv (US$10.0
million). The project will finance installation of water and sewer distribution,
drainage, roads, heat distribution, electricity and other trunk infrastructure to develop
land parcels for sale to private developers who will construct housing.
(iii)   Technical assistance, consisting of housing policy studies (housing finance
development and review of government housing assistance), review of land and
building regulations at the city level and consultancies and training to assist with
project implementation, project monitoring and beneficiary assessment at the national
and local levels (US$1.2 million).
There was limited interest among developers to take over unfinished municipal buildings. The
funding of uncompleted municipal housing for sale is a transitional measure. The project cities will
move from construction and allocation of housing to provision of infrastructure for housing
development by private developers. Improved access to land and simplification of land and building
regulation will promote the growth of developers who are expected to be the key suppliers of housing
in the future.
9.            The total project cost is estimated to be US$27.9 million equivalent, excluding local
taxes but including cost of works already completed by the city administrations on buildings and sites
to be financed under the project. A Bank loan of US$17.0 million will finance 61% of total project
cost net of taxes (55 % of costs including taxes) or 93 % of the foreign costs and 42 % of local costs.
The estimated costs and financing plan are presented in Schedule A. Proceeds of the Bank loan will
be onlent by the national government to the three project cities in US dollars on the Bank's terms and
conditions with a spread of 1 % to cover the administrative costs and risk. The project cities will bear
the foreign exchange risk. The Bank will enter into a Loan Agreement with Ukraine and a separate
Project Agreement with each project city. The national government will enter into a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement with each city administration.
Project Implementation
10.          Implementation of the housing completion and land development components will be
carried out by the respective city administrations. Each city will establish a unit (the city executing
unit, CEU), reporting to the mayor and comprised of staff from the departments handling construction
and housing, for this purpose. A project steering committee will be established at the national level
for overall policy coordination and project oversight. The steering committee will be co-chaired by
the State Committee on Urban Development and Architecture and the State Committee for Housing
and Municipal Economy, the two key sector agencies, and will include the other national government
agencies involved with housing. A small technical unit reporting to the steering committee will carry
out routine project monitoring and coordinate and implement the technical assistance component.
Project Sustainability
11.           Homeowners will be responsible for the management and maintenance of the buildings
themselves. All the apartments constructed under the project will be privately owned and the new
owners will form homeowners (condominium) associations to take over management and maintenance
of the buildings financed under the project. Owners generally take better care of their buildings than
renters; the management and maintenance tasks will initially be easier because newly constructed



- 4 -
buildings face fewer problems compared to older buildings where maintenance has been neglected in
the past. The city administrations will be responsible for maintaining the roads, drainage systems and
other infrastructure constructed through the project.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
12.          The proposed project supports the transition to a market based economy. The
proposed project will foster the growth of the housing market which, over time, will lead to greater
mobility of population (and flexibility in pursuing employment opportunities), improved quality of
housing and more efficient distribution of housing according to households needs. The project will
contribute to reduction in the direct role of government in the economy by completing and selling
unfinished municipal housing and by promoting the growth of private housing developers through
improving access to land for housing construction and simplifying building regulations and
procedures. In addition, the project will introduce competitive bidding in the selection of contractors
for housing construction and infrastructure development. Local construction enterprises will also gain
experience in tendering by participating in the procurement training to be carried out as part of
project implementation. The technical assistance studies will lay the foundations for future
development of the housing market and a less direct role for the government in the housing sector.
This project is consistent with the limited Country Assistance Strategy as discussed by the Board of
Directors during the presentation of the Ukraine Rehabilitation Loan (Loan 3831-UA) on December
22, 1994. A full Country Assistance Strategy will be presented to the Board soon.
Agreed Actions
13.          Prior to negotiations, the Government established the project steering committee,
confirmed city ownership of the buildings and sites to be financed through the project and developed a
land auction plan for 1996 and 1997. During negotiations, agreements were reached on: (a) sales of
completed housing and developed land, continuation of the land auction program, review of building
regulations, and competitive bidding in selection of contractors; (b) commitment by the cities not to
carry out additional new residential building construction for sale which will conflict with private
developer projects; (c) the financing arrangements for the technical assistance program; (d) on-
lending terms and conditions; (e) preparation of a marketing plan for completed housing and land; (f)
the project implementation arrangements and (g) a mid-term review to assess implementation to date
and actions following the technical assistance studies. Signing of subsidiary loan agreements,
satisfactory to the Bank, between the Government and two out of the three project cities and the
establishment of CEUs in the same two cities are conditions of loan effectiveness. Prior to the start
of disbursements for the remaining project city, the remaining subsidiary loan agreement will need to
be signed and the CEU established.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement
14.          The Bank has limited experience lending to Ukraine and for housing in Eastern
Europe. The three housing projects under implementation in Eastern Europe (the Poland Housing
Project, Loan 3499-PL, the Albania Housing Project, Credit 2534-AL, and the Russia Housing
Project Loan 3850-RU) adopt different approaches to housing, reinforcing the importance of
designing projects according to the needs and level of transition in the respective countries. The
Albanian project, which finances unfinished housing and thus is similar to this project, points to the
risk that the cities may go back on their commitment to market housing and allocate them to
households on the municipal housing wait list and/or continue in their role as housing developers.



- 5 -
The project is a small pilot working with progressive city administrations which have undertaken and
agreed to housing reforms and promoting private developers. These agreements are reflected in the
legal documents.
Poverty Category
15.          Not applicable. The project aims at promoting the development of a housing market
and is not targeted at addressing the shelter needs of the poor. Under the previous central planning
system, all households were provided with housing and minimal basic services so the poor do not
necessarily face an immediate crisis meeting basic shelter needs. The apartment units to be completed
under the project are smaller than the larger apartments being constructed to meet the demands of the
richer segments of society and should appeal to the middle and lower middle income groups.
Environmental Aspects
16.          Project activities are expected to have minimal negative impact since the project sites
will be located within urban areas, are in accordance with overall city development plans and will be
provided with adequate infrastructure to prevent pollution of adjacent areas. The project is expected
to have a positive impact on people's (beneficiaries') standard of living through improvements in
housing design. Improvements in ventilation, heat controls and other design standards will ensure a
more healthy indoor environment; better insulation, heat controls and metering have the potential to
contribute to the country's energy conservation program. An environmental analysis was carried out
in accordance with the category "B" environmental rating for the project.
Program Objective Categories
17.          The development of the housing market, reduction of the role of the cities in direct
provision of housing and measures to promote private housing developers will contribute to overall
improvements in economic management and private sector development.
Participatory Approach
18.          The key stakeholders in the project are the city administrations and potential
beneficiaries, the city residents and the emerging real estate developers. The city administrations
have been involved in project preparation and the need for improving access to land and simplifying
building regulations identified through interviews with developers. As construction proceeds,
community organization and participatory approaches will be needed to help facilitate formation of
homeowners associations, especially since there is a lack of tradition of urban residents coming
together to jointly reach decisions on amounts of expenditures needed for routine maintenance of
buildings or emergency repairs (which they had previously left to the city). The Bank will collaborate
with Odesa city administration to introduce participatory approaches in city investment decision
making.
Project Benefits
19.          The project will foster the development of a housing market by promoting private
ownership of housing and homeowner management of multifamily apartment buildings, improving
construction enterprises' access to land for housing construction and simplifying business regulations.
The project will support reform oriented city administrations in their move from allocation of housing



- 6 -
to provision of infrastructure, creating an environment for private developers to construct housing in
line with market demand. The studies financed under the project will assist the national government
to operationalize its Housing Policy Concept by formulating policies on government assistance for the
housing sector and housing finance development. Progress in city level reforms and follow up from
the policy studies will be the focus of a formal mid-term review to be carried out with senior
government officials during the first half of 1997. Over the long term, the development of a housing
market would provide greater choice of housing, allow greater mobility of population, generate
employment in the construction industry and contribute to domestic resource mobilization by
providing a motivation for households to save. Using estimated sales revenues as a measure of
project benefits, the housing components are estimated to have a weighted average economic rate of
return of 25%.
Risks
20.           The project faces many of the risks inherent in transition economies. If the economic
situation continues to deteriorate, lack of economic growth, depressed incomes and high inflation
would constrain the growth of the housing market, limit effective demand for new apartments and
dampen developer interest in purchasing serviced land for housing construction. To address these
risks, the scale of the project has been kept small; apartments constructed under the project account
for less than 0.1 % of the housing stock in the project cities and the scale of the land to be developed
has been reduced. The Bank loan will not impact severely on the cities' finances; the maximum
annual payment of interest and repayment of principal is estimated to be less than 1.5% of the cities'
current budget expenditures. Another risk is that project costs may increase because of lack of
experience in competitive bidding and real appreciation of the local currency relative to the US dollar
which would result in the project costs, expressed in US dollars, increasing above international
inflation. The project contingencies were estimated taking these factors into consideration. There is a
political risk that the city administrations will go back on their commitment to housing reform, for
example due to leadership changes. There is an awareness at the city level that both the national and
local governments lack the resources to return to the previous state provision of housing and hence a
willingness to experiment with alternatives. The project includes more than one city to spread this
political risk. Agreements on the city level reforms are incorporated in the legal agreements which
will allow for accelerated repayment of the subloan in case of deviation from agreed policy reforms.
The study on government assistance to housing will explore alternative measures to promote
homeownership that the Government could introduce to defuse the problem of the families on the
government waitlist which continues to be a serious political issue at the local level.
Recommendation
21.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
