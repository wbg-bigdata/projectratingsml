MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ECUADOR
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECI'
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Government of Ecuador (GoE) for US$15 million to help strengthen
environmental management capacity in the country. The loan would be a US Dollar Single
Currency Loan (SCL) with a fixed interest rate and the standard amortization term and grace
period for such loans with an expected disbursement of 3-6 years. The GoE is eligible for a SCL.
It has selected a fixed rate SCL in US Dollars in order to manage the risks associated with the
foreign currency composition of their assets and liabilities and to reduce their exposure to LIBOR
volatility for the country's overall debt portfolio.
Country/Sector Background
2.    Background. Ecuador is a relatively small country, with an area of 284 thousand square
kilometers, and a population of 11 million people. Excellent soil and climate conditions have
helped make Ecuador a leading exporter of bananas. The rich estuary of Guayaquil and the coastal
ecosystem has provided the appropriate conditions to develop a vibrant shrimp industry with
annual exports of about US$500 million. The unique ecosystems and biodiversity of the Amazon
and the Galapagos are the focus of attention for important scientific and environmental
institutions, and are increasingly important destinations for international ecotourism. The
expanding oil production in the Amazon, currently 280,000 barrels per day, accounts for about 40
percent of foreign trade, approximately US$2.5 billion. Ecuador enjoys a strong presence of
diverse indigenous peoples, and a rich cultural heritage ranging from the remains of the Valdivia
culture (5,000 years B.C.) to the UNESCO-World Heritage--colonial center of Quito.
3.    Key issues. Despite the importance of Ecuador's natural environment, over the last few
years a number of significant problems have emerged. The Amazon region has witnessed
significant social conflicts among indigenous communities, colonists and oil interests. The
environmental damage in this region has been exacerbated by the lack of environmental regulation
for oil exploration, production and transportation, the chaotic growth of towns associated with
the growing oil economy, and perverse incentives for colonization and deforestation. The
unexpected decline of shrimp production in 1993 in the Gulf of Guayaquil described as the Taura
Syndrome has been attributed to pesticide runoff from banana plantations, the uncontrolled use of
water resources in more than 125,000 hectares of shrimp ponds--requiring renovation of large
volumes of water -- and an overall mismanagement of the ecosystem through the uncontrolled
cutting of mangrove and the overexploitation of shrimp larvae. Municipal sewage and untreated
industrial effluent associated with the production of textiles, leather, sugar, processed food and
paper in Gulf communities and around the principal city of Guayaquil have also contributed to a
decline in the Gulf's water quality. High rates of urban population growth, 4.5 percent annually
over the last 30 years, and the increased industrial development have contributed to alarming
levels of water pollution and the inability of municipalities to adequately dispose of solid and



-2-
hazardous wastes.
4.    Legal/institutional Framework for Environmental Management. Addressing the country's
serious environmental problems is hindered by the lack of a well defined legal and institutional
framework for environmental management. For the first time, the 1994 National Environmental
Action Plan (NEAP) established environmental priorities and defined a strategy to develop a
coherent framework for effective environmental management at the national and local levels. The
centerpiece of the strategy is a participatory process comprised of key government agencies, the
private sector, provincial governments, municipalities and environmental NGOs. The end result
of this process will be a law establishing the institutional framework and specification of
responsibilities for environmental management. Currently, the Environmental Advisory
Commission (CAAM) which was established by Presidential Decree in 1993 and reports directly
to the President is charged with carrying forward the participatory process and recommending a
suitable and appropriate national environmental management framework. CAAM is composed of
representatives of government ministries and agencies, whose policies and programs directly
impact the use of natural resources or have under the current legal framework responsibility for
water and air quality, the private sector (chambers of commerce and industry) and environmental
NGOs. The Secretary of CAAM is also the Director of the Environment Office of the National
Planning Department (CONADE). A number of these ministries and agencies which are members
of CAAM's Executive Board, including CONADE and the National Forestry and Wildlife
Institute (INEFAN) are implementing environmental projects with support from the
InterAmerican Development Bank, the Global Environment Facility, and the European Economic
Commission, respectively. CAAM is currently receiving support from the EEC, UNDP, USAID
and the Government of Switzerland.
5.    Part of CAAM's mandate is to advise the congressional committee charged with the
responsibility for reviewing the environmental management law. The Committee already
approved a constitutional amendment introducing sound environmental principles, and is currently
discussing a draft of the law. The draft law proposes that environmental policy be the
responsibility of a National Environmental Council (CONAGA), assisted by a Technical
Secretariat. CAAM is currently playing a key role in preparing the organizational design and
operational plan for CONAGA and the Technical Secretary. CONAGA will be an autonomous
agency of the Government with responsibilities for designing environmental management policies
and promoting and implementing environmental programs. The Technical Secretariat will have
overall responsibility for management of the environment,
6.    The Bank has been actively assisting CAAM in developing the national environmental
strategy through a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) and a grant from the Policy and Human
Resource Development Fund of Japan (PHRD). Continued support through the proposed
technical assistance loan will enable the Government to continue to consolidate the process while
addressing critical needs for institutional strengthening, policy analysis, and the definition of
practical solutions to Ecuador's most pressing environmental management issues.
Project Objectives
7.    The overall objective of the project is twofold: (i) to provide support for the ongoing



- 3 -
process of implementing the national environmental management strategy; and (ii) to assist the
GoE in building up an environmental management capacity in three priority geographic areas
identified in the NEAP: urban areas, the Gulf of Guayaquil, and the Amazon.
8.    The specific objectives of the project are to: (i) strengthen the capacity of CAAM to
undertake environmental policy analysis and environmental program design and management; (ii)
strengthen the environmental management capability of three key ministries; (iii) establish and
strengthen urban environmental management capability in selected urban areas; and (iv) build
institutional capacity and carry out the participatory processes and technical analysis required to
resolve two of Ecuador's most serious environmental problems, particularly those related to
pollution of the Gulf of Guayaquil and the area in the Amazon most affected by oil exploration
and production. Progress in meeting these objectives will be evaluated based on the indicators of
project outcomes and impacts described in Schedule B.
Project Description
9.    The proposed Environmental Management Project would consist of four components:
(a)   Component 1: Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening (Total cost:
US$6.5 million);
(b)   Component 2: Environmental Planning and Management in the Ecuadorian
Amazon (Total cost: US$3.1 million);
(c)   Component 3: Municipal Environmental Management (Total cost: US$3.9
million); and
(d)   Component 4: Environmental Information and Management in the Gulf of
Guayaquil (Total cost: US$6.5 million);
10.   Component 1: Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening (32.5%): The
institutions to be strengthened have a clear mandate to develop and implement environmental
policies and programs. Their areas of responsibility both in geographic and technical terms are
directly related to three priority areas identified by CAAM during the preparation of the NEAP.
Other institutions which under current law also have environmental management responsibilities
will not be supported by this component as they are currently receiving support from other donors
or other World Bank projects.
11.   Support under this component will include: (i) strengthening the capacity of CAAM to
undertake environmental policy analysis, environmental program design and management, and
undertake a promotional campaign to mobilize public support for, and participation in, those
activities ; (ii) review and updating of the pollution control legislation and the establishment of
appropriate guidelines and standards, including the development of a national system of
environmental impact assessment; (iii) design and implementation of a national environmental
information system; and (iv) establishment and support of the project implementation unit in
CAAM.
12.   This component would also finance policy formulation and institutional strengthening in
the Ministry of Urban Development (MIDUVI), the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Integration
and Fisheries (MICIP), and Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM). The most important activities
include: (i) design of water quality and solid waste management policies and water quality



-4 -
monitoring systems in MIDUVI; (ii) design of industrial pollution prevention and control policies,
review of existing fisheries policies and preparation of revised regulations including the upgrading
of the fisheries resource monitoring systems in MICIP; (iii) design of environmental assessment,
monitoring and control guidelines in MEM; (iv) training of staff in the environmental units of
MIDUVI, MICIP, PetroEcuador, and MEM; and (v) acquisition of computers and office
equipment for all participating institutions. Additional details can be found in the Technical Annex
(Report T-6716EC).
13.   Component 2: Environmental Management and Planning in the Amazon (15.5%). The
component addresses in a modest way some of the important environmental issues facing the
Ecuadorian Amazon and will finance: (i) regional development planning which takes into account
the region's fragile ecosystem, rich biodiversity and culture; (ii) grass roots environmental
improvement subprojects; and (iii) implementation of sustainable development subprojects.
14.   This component will comprise: (i) support for the Municipality of Shushufindi to prepare a
pilot plan for the sustainable development of the Shushufindi area; (ii) support for sustainable
development programs and subprojects focusing on improved technologies for coffee production,
forest management and small scale aquaculture; and (iii) support for a small grants/subprojects
program for local level NGOs (maximum grant amount US$15,000) whose major focus is
community based environmental management. CAAM will prepare specific criteria acceptable to
the Bank for subproject approval. They are likely to include: importance to the local environment,
community participation, project sustainability, grant eligibility requirements, potential for
replication, and a cost ceiling. These criteria will be described in detail in the Operating Manual to
be adopted by effectiveness.
15.   Component 3: Municipal/Provincial EnvironmentalManagement (19.5%). This
component will address priority areas for environmental management by focusing activities at
three levels: large urban centers, small and medium size cities and low income neighborhoods in
several cities. Program approaches for improving environmental management in each of these
areas will differ based on the urgency of the environmental problems and the most suitable
institutional framework for implementation.
16.   The large urban areas subcomponent will provide support for: institutional strengthening,
environmental planning, and pilot environmental projects in the large urban areas of Quito,
Guayaquil and Cuenca. The small and medium sized cities subcomponent will develop the
technical capacity to address environmental concerns in towns and small cities through the
establishment of 4 environmental resource centers, including one in the Province of Manabi. The
community based environmental development subcomponent will develop and implement
community based environmental training activities in low income neighborhoods of 8 cities
through the existing Program for Improving Poor Neighborhoods and Low Income Housing
(CAVIP). The latter program is currently being implemented by NGOs under the supervision of
MIDUVI.
17.   Component 4: Environmental Management and Information in the Gulf of Guayaquil
(32.5%). The component addresses the most important environmental problems and
environmental management challenges facing the Gulf of Guayaquil: fisheries and shrimp
aquaculture management, coastal zoning and resources management, watershed and water
resources management; water pollution, inadequate and incomplete scientific information, and the



- 5 -
lack of interinstitutional coordination and management among national government agencies,
municipalities and the most important industries whose productive activities impact the
environmental quality of the Gulf.
18.   This component will comprise: (i) completion of base line scientific studies of pollution in
the Gulf and an analysis of the various biological, hydrological, oceanographic, and biochemical
interactions which impact on the Gulf's ecology; (ii) resource policy analysis and development and
implementation of an environmental planning and management system; (iii) an examination of
current pesticide use practices in banana cultivation and identification of possible alternatives
including integrated pest management; (iv) institutional strengthening of key government and
community level organizations with responsibility for enforcement of resource management
policies, especially mangrove ecosystems; (v) design of priority environmental investment
projects; and (vi) establishment of the Guayaquil project management unit (GMU).
Project Cost and Financing
19.   The total cost of the project over four years (excluding taxes and including contingencies)
is US$20 million, approximately 18% of which is estimated to be foreign exchange. The
Government is requesting an IBRD loan of US$15 million. The remaining counterpart funds of
(US$5 million) will be provided by the Government of Ecuador, the Association of Municipalities
(AME) and the municipalities of Quito, Guayaquil and Cuenca. The proceeds of the loan will be
disbursed over a 4 year period. A special account would be established in the Central Bank or a
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank with an authorized allocation of up to US$ 1,000,000 to
be managed by CAAM. Project accounts will be audited annually by external independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. Schedule A specifies the project costs and financing plan . Schedule C
provides a summary of proposed procurement arrangements, procurement thresholds and
disbursement.
Project Implementation Arrangements
20.   Section D of the Technical Annex details project administration and implementation. The
Republic of Ecuador would be the Borrower and CAAM the executing agency responsible for
project implementation. Counterpart resources and coordination of project activities will be
assured by implementation agreements (Convenios) or institutional arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank, to be made between the Republic of Ecuador through CAAM and the key project
institutions receiving technical assistance: MAG, MIDUVI, MEM, MICIP, INP, INOCAR, and
the Municipalities of Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca, and Shushufindi, the Provincial Council of
Manabi and AME. Each Convenio and arrangement would describe: (i) the budget, personnel,
and facilities to be allocated by the beneficiary institution to its environmental unit as counterpart
resources for the project; (ii) the technical assistance/goods to be provided by CAAM to the
beneficiary institution and the timetable for its implementation; (iii) terms of reference and cost
figures of the technical assistance to be provided by CAAM, as well as project activities which are
not considered technical assistance; (iv) procurement/disbursement/accounting procedures; and
(v) procedures to be followed by CAAM and the beneficiary institution for supervising the
implementation of the technical assistance activities to be financed by the proposed project.
Specifics of the Convenios and arrangements have been discussed between CAAM and the
respective institutions, embodied in "letters of intent" which would then be incorporated into the



-6 -
Convenios or arrangements to be signed before disbursing for the respective component.
21.   Project implementation has been designed in a programmatic way. However, technical
assistance activities have been broadly identified for the entire project, which will be reviewed and
adjusted every year in the context of Annual Operating Plans, which will be prepared by CAAM.
These plans are the essential tool for project implementation, monitoring and supervision. The
operating plan for the first year of project implementation has been finalized. The Year One
Operating Plan also includes indicators of project outcomes and impacts (see Schedule B).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that CAAM will furnish to the Bank for approval
each year annual operating plans. Assurances were also obtained that CAAM will select and
finance subprojects in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Operating Manual (to be
adopted by effectiveness).
22.   The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of CAAM will be responsible for the preparation
of Semi-Annual Progress Reports which detail and measure the project's progress against the
Annual Operating Plan. Both the Annual Operating Plan and the Semi-Annual Progress Reports
will provide data for the monitoring of project impacts. The project will require a significant
level of supervision by CAAM, particularly during the first year of the project, in order to ensure
a smooth project start, a close follow-up of the transition to a new Government in the period
May-August 1996, and preparation of a well designed and comprehensive operating plan for the
second year of project implementation. The Bank's Resident Mission in Quito, with guidance
from headquarters, will play a significant role in all aspects of project supervision. Its role and
responsibility will increase over the life of the project.
Project Sustainability
23.   The institutional landscape for environmental policy and management has been improved
with the government's decision to support CAAM and submit to Congress the new environmental
law. During project preparation, CAAM made remarkable progress in consolidating the
participatory process and in creating a policy framework for environmental management in
Ecuador. Many of the institutions which are members of CAAM will participate in the project.
The ongoing process of decentralizing specific government functions to the municipal level
provides an important opportunity to address pressing environmental problems and should
enhance the prospects of successful project implementation and financial sustainability. During the
annual project planning exercise and the preparation of Annual Operating plans, implementing
organizations will be fully involved in all decision making in implementing the convenios and
follow-up activities. Additionally, if the law is enacted, it will serve to catalyze the work
undertaken by this project.
Lessonsfrom Previous Bank Involvement
24.   Since 1991, the Bank has been active in developing institutional strengthening projects for
the environmental sector in a variety of borrower countries including Bolivia, Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Honduras, Indonesia and Mexico. The experience to date indicates that a well defined
legal and institutional framework for environmental management is important for policy
development, environmental monitoring and the implementation of environmental programs,
including procedures for environmental impact assessments. The design of the proposed project



- 7 -
has also taken into account recent analytical work such as the Bank's Urban Environmental
Problems in National Environmental Strategies and Action Plans. 1994. These studies suggest
that environmental management projects need to be designed in a way which take into account
political realities such as rivalries between agencies. They must also incorporate project
management training, establish environmental management priorities and public participation
processes.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
25.   The possibility of developing a comprehensive environmental management project
resurfaced two years ago following the establishment of the CAAM. The project is fully consistent
with the country assistance strategy for Ecuador which will be presented to the Board in April 1996
which states as priorities: preservation of macroeconomic stability, modernization of the state,
promoting private sector development as well as social sector reforms and targeted poverty reduction.
With regard to the environmental agenda, the focus is on efforts to further the ongoing process of
institutional development and legal review and reform. Given the weaknesses of the country's
environmental institutions, the current conflicts between the oil sector and user groups in the Amazon,
and water quality problems from different sources in the Guayas River basin, the Bank's presence
would help to bring about institutional strengthening and administrative reform. These would include
resolving conflicts between different user groups and the strengthening of environmental management
capability at the national, municipal and grassroots levels. The proposed project will complement the
European Union's (EU) ECUs10.00 million operation designed to mitigate the environmental impact
of hydrocarbon operations in three protected areas and to strengthen the DINAMA within the MEM.
Agreed Actions
26.   Conditions of Effectiveness: (a) Signature of one institutional arrangement under The
Policy Formulation and Institutional Strengthening Component; (b) Signature of one agreement
with a Municipality; and (c) adoption of a Project Operating Manual satisfactory to the Bank.
27.   Conditions of Disbursement: Disbursements for project activities covered by specific
Convenios would be conditional upon signature of the pertinent Convenio.
28.   Assurances (a) CAAM will submit the Annual Operating Plan yearly by the agreed date;
(b) Subprojects will be selected, financed and implemented in accordance with the Operating
Manual; (c) CAAM will review yearly progress in the implementation of the project and in the
case of unsatisfactory progress, remedial action will be taken.
Poverty Category
29.   Due to the nature of this project, it will not be included in the Program of Targeted
Interventions. However, indirectly, by helping to establish environmental management capacity in
Ecuador's cities and towns and by targeting two geographic areas with serious environmental
problems, environmental pollution and health risks should be reduced. The project will also work
directly in selected urban low income areas and in poor Amazon communities.



-8 -
Environmental Aspects
30.   There should be no adverse impacts on the environment as a result of this technical
assistance project. Project impact should include improved environmental conditions in the two
priority geographic areas and in the three large cites and small and medium sized urban areas.
This project has been rated as a category B for environmental review purposes.
Program Objective Category
31.   The project falls under the main program category of "Environmental Institutions".
Participatory Approach
32.   The Bank team which included active participation by the Resident Mission at the
preparation and appraisal stages, CAAM and organizations which will play a role in
implementation interacted closely throughout preparation. The CAAM project preparation team
solicited inputs to project design from municipal governments, ministries and independent
agencies and NGOs, including the National Council of Environmental NGOs (CEDENMA). This
participatory approach will continue during project implementation.
Benefits
33.   This project will mainly provide benefits to populations living in Ecuador's urban areas,
communities surrounding the Gulf of Guayaquil, and communities in the Shushufindi region of the
Amazon. The most important benefits include: the development of guidelines and standards for
industrial pollution control; and, the analysis of factors and policy options which can contribute to
sustainable shrimp aquaculture and fisheries in the Gulf of Guayaquil. In particular, the proposed
project will help the government carry out its environmental commitments by strengthening the
legal and institutional framework for environmental management and preparing the requisite
guidelines, procedures and standards for environmental impact assessment. Communities in the
Amazon and low income urban areas will directly benefit from the proposed pilot environmental
improvement projects.
Risks
34.   The project's main risks include limited commitment from participating agencies and
ineffective implementation of the project. The risk of limited commitment is reduced by two
factors. First, the commitment of the key participating agencies has been established in signed
letters of intent, and will be confirmed by implementation agreements /arrangements (Convenios)
which are a condition of effectiveness and disbursement. Second, the programmatic design of the
project based on annual operating plans provides both flexibility to adjust the allocation of
resources and promotes competition among the project entities to get access to the technical
assistance provided by the project. The risk of ineffective implementation of the project has been
addressed by selecting CAAM, duly empowered to coordinate project activities, as the managing
institution of the overall project, in charge of all procurement and disbursement activities under



- 9 -
the project. CAAM has a good record managing the PPF as well as several grants from
international donors, including the Interamerican Development Bank, and the European
Commission. The project's strong emphasis on coordination and consultation with national and
local level NGO's and communities will ensure effective targeting and implementation of the pilot
subprojects. Supervision of the project will be carried out by CAAM assisted by specialists for the
more complex activities to be hired under the project. Bank supervision will be concentrated in
CAAM. Additionally, an experienced long-term consultant has been hired to provide a close
supervision of the project from the Bank's Representative Office in Quito. The GoE has selected
a fixed rate SCL in US Dollars in order to manage the risks associated with the foreign currency
composition of their assets and liabilities and to reduce their exposure to LIBOR volatility for the
country's overall debt portfolio.
Recommendation
35.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
