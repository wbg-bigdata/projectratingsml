MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENr
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR A THIRD KABUPATEN ROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the
equivalent of US$215 million to help finance a Third Kabupaten Roads
Development project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate with a maturity of 20 years including five years of grace.
2.          Background.  Kabupaten or district roads (which are the secondary
roads linking small towns and villages and connecting to the primary national
and provincial road system) play a key role in the economic and social
development of Indonesia, particularly because of its high proportion of rural
population and the importance of agriculture in the Indonesian economy.
Unlike the primary road system which has remained at about 50,000 km in recent
years, the kabupaten road network has grown rapidly from about 80,000 km in
1980 to about 160,000 km in 1990. Expenditures on kabupaten roads have also
grown quickly in recent years (from about Rp 290 b:llion in 1985/86 to about
Rp 1,160.billion in 1991/92), as GOI, with the assistance of several donors
(IBRD, ADB, OECF, and USAID), has given high priority to kabupaten roads as
part of a development strategy which has emphasized private sector
development, export growth, and regional equity, and has also recognized the
key importance of infrastructure to achieve these objectives. Yet, because of
weaknesses outlined below, the kabupaten road network has improved only slowly
and remains of poor quality. In 1990, only about 40 percent of the network
was in good or fair condition. Many rural communities and areas of potential
development are thus inadequately linked to the main centers of economic life.
This is in contrast with the primary road system, which, although in need of
much improvement in capacity and service level, is now in relatively good
condition, thanks to a better institutional and technical environment,
including greater emphasis on maintenance.
3.          Subsector Issues.  Despite progress in recent years, there are
many interrelated institutional and technical weaknesses affecting the
subsector, which are often linked to its high level of decentralization. They
include: (i) inadequate road maintenance due, in particular, to insufficient
funding; (ii) inefficient practices in the selection, preparation, and
implementation of road works which result in particular in a product of poor
quality and short service life; (iii) shortage of skilled technical staff and
inadequacy of training programs; (iv) insufficient use of modern road
technologies; and (v) weak accountability of local staff. In addition,
althnugh road transport is responsive to demand and of a relatively low
financial cost, there are issues affecting its efficiency, mainly the need to
modernize road transport laws and regulations and improve their administration
as well as to increase and restructure road user taxation.
4.          GOI Objectives and Strategv.  In recent years, GOI has
consistently placed much importance on the transportation sector as a key
means to promote economic growth and regional development. In the subsector,
GOI1's main objective has been to achieve minimum standards of road density and
road condition in each kabupaten through a high level of funding (particularly
to the less developed parts of Indonesia) and steady improvements in the



- 2 -
institutional and technical framework for preparation and implementation of
kabupaten road programs. To this effect, GOI has taken substantial measures
to improve procedures and methodologies for road planning and, to a lesser
extent, for design, construction and supervision. It has also improved the
allocation of responsibilities among concerned agencies and increased the
capability and accountability of kabupaten administrations. GOI has also been
implementing since early 1990 an action plan agreed with the Bank to improve,
in particular, the efficiency of road transport. Progress in the action plan
is satisfactory although below original expectation. In general, the Bank
concurs with GOI's objectives and associated strategy.
5.          Lessons Learned From Previous Bank Involvement.  Main lessons
learned from Bank operations ir. the subsector in Indonesia include the
following: (a) improving road maintenance requires a major change in
entrenched habits; many factors can help in bringing it about, including Bank
financing, priority attention by both GOI and Bank staff, and better
programming and implementation methods; (b) major institutional and technical
improvements in the subsector can be achieved but need to be carefully
designed and well integrated in GOI's existing systems and procedures; this
takes much time and effort from all parties involved; (c) quality of
construction can improve substantially with better and clearly defined
implementation arrangements, including intensive field supervision and better
guidance by provincial and central road agencies; (d) timely implementation
requires that programs of civil works be prepared and procurement action
initiated well ahead of time; (e) project-financed training programs need to
be based on a careful assessment of training needs and priorities; and (f)
improvements in incentives and regulations for road transport services are
better pursued through a subsector operation, such as the proposed Second
Highway Sector Project and through dialogue at macro level.  These lessons
which are confirmed by Bank experience in other countries have been taken into
account in the design of the project.
6.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Continued Bank support to the
kabupaten road subsector is needed for the following reasons: (a) good access
is a prerequisite for most development activities in rural areas and is
particularly important to reduce rural poverty; (b) a sizable part of GOI's
development budget is now aimed at improving kabupaten roads and it is
important that these funds be used as efficiently as possible and that the
environmental impacts be addressed systematically; (c)the Bank can provide key
assistance to GOI in the formulation and implementation of institutional and
technical improvements at subsector level, especially in view of GOI's
shortage of expertise; and (d) Bank involvement can help GOI give priority to
road maintenance and less emphasis to rehabilitation/improvement of the
kabupaten road network.
7.          Project Objectives.  The project's main objectives are to improve
the quality of the road network in 73 kabupatens in nine provinces (West Java,
West Kalimantan and all provinces of Sumatra except Riau) and to enhance the
capability of GOI agencies in charge of kabupaten roads. More specifically,
the project aims at: (i) improving systems and procedures for road maintenance
and ensuring that the maintainable network of all project kabupatens (about
25,000 km) is satisfactorily maintained; (ii) rehabilitating/improving about
4,200 km of roads; (iii) improving the capability of staff involved in the
subsector at all levels; and (iv) strengthening institutional arrangements and
improving the technical environment for planning and implementing kabupaten
road works programs. The 73 kabupatens were selected by GOI to avoid overlap



- 3 -
with projects financed by other donors. An additional 45 kabupatens, most of
Indonesia's eastern region, are expected to be covered by another Bank project
now under preparation.
8.          Project Descrigtion.  The project will have the following main
components: (i) civil works, including routine and periodic maintenance of the
maintainable road network as well as rehabilitation/improvement of selected
roads in project kabupatens, upgrading of workshops and laboratories,
provision of equipment, and supervision of works (US$ 478.2m); (ii) training,
including detailed preparation and implementation of priority parts of a
nationwide training program for kabupaten road staff as well as improvements
in training management (US$9.6m); (iii) technical assistance and studies for
strengthening systems and procedures nationwide regarding planning,
environmental analysis, and implementation of road works, (US$11.4m). The
project's total cost will be about US$499.2 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$168.8 million.
9.          A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations int Indonesia are given in Schedule C and D respect-!7elv
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10551-IND dated May
22, 1992 is being distributed separately. The Bank loan will finance routine
road maintenance because experience of past projects has shown it to be key to
a change of attitude and to successful implementation at this stage. Given
the short duration of the project (3 years) and for administrative simplicity,
Bank financing of maintenance will be at a constant percentage (40%).
However, because annual maintenance targets will be increasing, GOI's fuaLding
will be a growing share of total maintenance needs as well as of incremental
maintenance expenditures.
10.         Implementation.  The project will be implemented mainly by the
kabupaten public works units with support from the provincial and central
governments.  DGH will be the executing agency.   GOI's normal institutional
mechanisms (including funding through the INPRES programs, GOI's central
grants to kabupaten governments) will be used, with improvements based on the
experience of the previous project. All periodic maintenance and
rehabilitation/improvement works and at least 50% of routine maintenance works
will be executed by contractors.
11.         Project Sustainability.  Institutional and technical improvements
to be achieved through the project are sustainable because (a) they are well
integrated in the subsector's current organization and procedures and, in many
cases, conceived as extensions of previous ameliorations; (b) they take
account of the capabilities of staff and agencies involved; and (c) the
project includes support and training of local staff. Improvements to be
achieved in road maintenance are also sustainable because (a) GOI's commitment
to maintenance is high and its own funding of maintenance will be set on a
rapidly increasing path: and (b) the project will help institutionalize this
policy, in particular through development of planning/programming and
implementation systems. Better road maintenance will in addition help sustain
the increase in road quality achieved through the project.
12.         Actions Agreed.  The following main agreements were reached at
negotiations: (a) GOI will cause each kabupaten to submit to the Bank by
December 31 each year its annual road maintenance and project-related
rehabilitation/ improvement programs for the following fiscal year prepared as



- 4 -
agreed; (b) GO1 will select subprojects for the road maintenance and
rehabilitation/ improvement components of the project in accordance with
criteria and procedures (including environmental assessment procedures)
satisfactory to the Bank; (c) GOI will submit to the Bank by June 30, 1993,
and December 31, 1993 and 1994, its annual program for in-house delivery of
training programs; (d) by November 1, 1992, GOI will establish a Project
Secretariat for assisting in coordination of agencies involved in the project,
and a Project Implementation Unit in DGH for monitoring project execution; and
(e) civil works contracts will be packaged in accurdance with criteria
satisfactory to the Bank.
13.         Environmental Impact.   Most road works proposed for the project
would only have minor impacts on the environment which will be mitigated
through the use of simple environmental guidelines for design and
implementation. Proposed works with possible significant impacts (expected to
be about 10% of all road works proposals) as identified by an agreed screening
process, will be submitted to a detailed environmental assessment (EA) in
accordance with GOI procedures and criteria agreed with the Bank. The project
includes TA support for this purpose. The EA will be reviewed by the Bank,
and only road works for which there is no doubt that the impacts are
adequately mitigated will be accepted for Bank financing. No road works will
be eligible for Bank financing if they provide access to any area where
induced development may have significant indirect environmental impacts.
14.         Program Objectives Categories.  The project will contribute to
several of the Bank's program objectives. The main contribution will be to
the basic infrastructure and public sector management categories, through the
improvements expected in road network quality, in the subsector's
institutional and technical framework, and in the capability of kabupaten road
staff. The project will also contribute to the environment and poverty
reduction objectives: it will introduce practical methods to identify and
control the potential environmental impacts of kabupaten road works; it will
also provide employment for low skilled labor through its large civil works
program and contribute indirectly to poverty reduction through economic
development in rural areas.
15.         Project Benefits.  Rehabilitation/improvement and improved
maintenance of roads would lead to significant reduction of vehicle operating
costs in the 73 kabupatens. The global ERR is estimated to be about 35%. In
addition, the project would increase GOI#s capability to plan and implement
kabupaten road works programs efficiently in the entire country, thereby
reducing the costs of road provision and road use. Over time, lower road
transport costs will translate in lower agricultural costs, higher rural
incomes, and a better integration of the Indonesian economy.
16.        I&iska. The main project risk is that the substantial changes that
this project would introduce in the way kabupaten road works programs are
prepared and implemented would take longer than expected to take root,
particularly in view of the still evolving allocation of responsibilities
between MPW and MHA and the limited capacity of the agencies in charge of
assisting and supervising kabupatens. To reduce the risk, GOI's national
planning agency, BAPPENAS, will continue to play a strong coordinating role
and a project mid-term implementation review would be carried out around
September 1993. Another risk is that project kabupatens may be reluctant to
increase their funding of maintenance as much as expected to fulfill project's
targets. To reduce this risk, the targets have been carefully designed and
annual eligibility conditions established for individual kabupatens.

17.         Recommendtion. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement cf the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
