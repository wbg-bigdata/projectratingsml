APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of the Central African Republie (CAR) has requested
IDA assistance in financing a highway project consisting of:
ti) the reconstruction of the Bangui-M'baiki road (102 km); and
(ii) the provision of equipment to maintain the road.
ii.       The total cost of the project, including contingencies, is esti-
mated at about US$5.6 million equivalent. The foreign exchange component
is estimated at about US$4.2 million equivalent and will be financed from
the proposed credit which will be the first lending operation by either
the Bank or the Association in the CAR. Local currency requirements will
be provided by the Government.
iii.      Detailed engineering of the project road was carried out by con-
sultants SAUTI (Italy) in 1965/66 under a FED agreement but had to be supple-
mented by the Directorate of Public Works (DPW) in 1968. The project in-
eludes financing of the foreign exchange costs of these supplementary
engineering works and the cost of prequalification of the total of con-
tracting firms by consultants, which amounts to US$23,000.
iv.       Design standards are satisfactory; contracts for construction and
the procurement of highway maintenance equipment will be on the basis of
international competitive bidding procedures. Supervision of the project
will be by the Directorate of Public Works.
V.        The economic evaluation of the project is based on a report
prepared by consultants SAUTI, which were engaged at the Bank's expense at
the end of 1967. Reconstruction of the project road, which is one of the
most important highway links of the country, will produce savings in
vehicle operating costs yielding an economic return of about 14% in
directly measurable benefits.
vi.       Two UNDP financed surveys are being carried out in the CAR,
covering a road maintenance study for the entire road network, a feasibility
study for the Sibut-Bambari road and a regional transport survey for the
CAR and Cameroon. Preliminary results of the last study indicate that the
Bangui-M'baiki road will be the first section of a recommended link between
Bangui and Douala, Cameroon's port at the Atlantic Ocean.
vii.      The project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$4.2
million to the Government of the CAR.



CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC
APPRAISAL OF A HIGIWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1       Early in 1966 the Government of the Central African Republie
(CAR) requested IDA assistance in financing part of its highway program.
As a result of this request, the Bank engaged at its own expense in late
1967 the Italian Consulting Engineering firm SAUTI to study the economic
justification of rehabilitating the Bangui-M'baiki Road. This study and
subsequent discussions with the Government have led to a request to IDA
to finance a project which comprises:
a. Reconstruction of the Bangui-M'baiki Road (102 km), including
(i) supplementary engineering works carried out by the
Directorate of Public Works (DPW); and,
(ii) supervision of construction works by the DPW;
b. Provision of equipment to maintain the road.
1.2       The Bank is the executing agent for two UNDP studies now being
carried out in the country:
(i)  a regional transport survey in the southwestern part
of the country and the adjacent part of Cameroon
uzdertaken jointly by the consulting firms NEDECO
(Netherlands) and BCEOM (France); and,
(ii) a feasibility study to be followed by final engineering
for the reconstruction of the Sibut-Bambari Road,
combined with the preparation of a program for improv-
ing road maintenance operations for the entire road
network of the CAR. The consultants are Research and
Development (Belgium).
The result of the studies will assist the Government of the Central African
Republic in the planning of the transport infrastructure of the southwestern
region and in the preparation of the maintenance budget for the next five
years (see paras. 2.9 and 3.14).
1.3       The proposed credit would be the first lending operation in the
CAR by either the Bank or the Association.
1.h       This report is based on engineering and economic studies carried
out by SAUTI, supplementary engineering works and cost estimates prepared
by the DPW and the findings of missions which visited the country in Octo-
ber 1967, and in February and October 1968. The last mission consisted of
4ossrs. Bergan and Snel (Engineers) and T. Oursin (Economist). This
report was prepared by the members of this last mission.

2. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.1       The Central African Republic, under French administration until
1960, is a landlocked country in the heart of Africa (see Maps). It covers
an area of about 625,000 m 2, about twice the size of Italy.  The country
lies on the northern edge of the Congo river basin. It is bordered on the
north by Chad, the east by the Sudan, the south by the two Congos and the
west by Cameroon.  In the southern part numerous water courses feed the
Oubangui River, a tributary of the Congo. The rivers in the north flow
ultimately into Lake Chad. The climate is tropical, with a rainy season
from April to November.
2.2       In 1966 the population was estimated at about 1.r million, with
a very low overall density of about two inhabitants per km . The main pop-
ulation centers, which account for more than one-quarter of the total pop-
ulation, are increasing in size as migration from rural areas continues,
whereas large areas in the northeast of the country are virtually uninhabited.
Population growth is estimated at about 2% per annum.
2.3       Subsistence agriculture is the dominant factor in the economy of
the CAR. Cotton and coffee are the main export crops but the quantities
involved are relatively small. Coffee production, about 11,000 tons in
1966 and 9,000 tons in 1967, has varied over the years due principally to
weather conditions. Cotton exports reached a peak of about 16,000 tons of
lint in 1958/59 but declined during the early years of independence to about
8,000 tons in 1966. In the recent past, the Government has made strenuous
efforts to reverse the trend; as a result, cotton exports went up to 12,000
tons in 1967. The country is rich in timber but exploitation is handicapped
by lack of transport and by long distances to the coast. Diamond mining
has been contributing increasingly to the growth of the economy during the
present decade; recorded diamond exports have risen from US$1.7 million
equivalent in 1960 to approximately US$17 million equivalent in 1967 when
they represented about 50% of all exports.
2.4       Existing national income statistics are insufficient for a
detailed analysis of recent trends and developments.  The annual growth of
the monetary GDP (at 1961 prices) which was about 8% from 1956 to 1961,
slowed down to an average of less than 3% in the years thereafter but
gained momentum in 1966 and 1967. Total GDP per capita at current market
prices was estimated at about CFAF 28,000 (US$110) in 1967.
B. The Transport Sector
(a) International Transport
2.5       Being a landlocked country, the CAR depends on facilities in its
neighboring countries for international transport. There are at present
two principal trade routes to ports on the Atlantic Ocean:



- 3 -
(i) by river from Bangui to Brazzaville (1,300 km) and thence
by rail to Pointe Noire (515 km); and,
(ii)  by road from Bangui to Yaounde (1,100 km) and thence by
rail to Douala (309 km).
(i)       Bangui to Pointe Noire Route
2.6       The route via Brazzaville to Pointe Noire carries virtually all
goods to and from the country. Under an agreement initiated during the
period of the French administration, the route is administered by the
Agence Transequatoriale des Communications (ATEC), an institution jointly
controlled by CAR, Chad, Congo (3) and Gabon. ATEC operates the ports of
Pointe Noire, Brazzaville and Bangui as well as the CFCO railway from
Brazzaville to Pointe Noire.  It also maintains the waterways from Brazza-
ville to the CAR and the highways connecting Chad and Gabon with. this
network,
2.7       In 1967 the port of Bangui handled about 213,000 tons of cargo,
about one-quarter of which was for Chad (Table 1). Salo, a small port on
the Sangha river in the southwestern corner of the country had a turnover
of about 8,000 tons in the same year.
2.8       River transport on the Oubangui is carried out by private enter-
prise. Transport rates on the rail-river system vary according to commod-
ity and direction of movement. Domnstream from Bangui to Pointe Noire,
total transport charges range from US$28 to 56 per ton, whereas upstream
the costs range from US$42 to 70 per ton.
(ii)      Bangui to Douala Route
2.9       The roads to Yaounde are in bad condition so these routes are
seldom used for long distance transport. Transport charges between Ban-
gui and Douala are about US$70 per ton.  The new Cameroon Railway, from
Yaounde to Jelabo, will not significantly reduce transport costs between
Bangui and Douala and would only marginally affect traffic using the
route to Pointe Noire. However, the Government hopes that, by improving
overland connections to the Cameroon Railway, it will lessen its depend-
ence on a single outlet to the sea as well as reduce transport costs. A
UNDP survey (see para.l.2), is currently investigating the possibilities
of coordinating transport development in the southwest of the country
and the adjacent parts of Cameroon. The survey will provide preliminary
engineering studies and detailed recommendations for the most suitable
transport link between Bangui and Douala. Preliminary results of the
study indicate that the 3angui-Nil'baiki Road would be the first section
of the recommended link from Bangui to Douala.
(b) Internal Transport
2.10      The CAR's internal transport is moved almost exclusively by
road. The highway network (see para.3.1) is generally adequate in length
but transport conditions are difficult due to lack of highway maintenance.



- 4 -
Domestic river transport on the Upper Bangui, east of Bangui, has been
decreasing in recent years because of increased competition by road trans-
port.
2.11      The country is served by a modern airport at Bangui which is
used by large jet aircraft of international airlines; there are also twen-
ty smaller fields, 10 of which are regularly served by Air Bangui, which
handles the bulk of internal air traffic.
(c) Transport Policy
2.12      Prior to independence the desire to maintain a transport link
between Pointe Noire and Fort Lamy in Chad dominated transport policy in
the area. The planning of transport aimed specifically at serving the
needs of the CAR, was initiated only after independence.
2.13      The Four-Year Development Plan 1967-1970 clearly emphasizes the
importance of improving the country's highway network. There is little
problem of transport coordination as internal transport other than by road
is negligible.
2.14      The trucking industry has to meet great seasonal fluctuations;
cotton production has to be moved to Bangui within a short period and
requires considerable trucking capacity which is underemployed during
the remainder of the year. This situation causes sharp competition with-
in the industry whiclh is characterized by an uneven distribution of capac-
ity bettween a few large and well-organized companies and a large number
of small truckers.
2.15      In order to improve the economic situation of the trucking
industry, the Government is supporting a cooperative of truckers which was
established in 1968. The cooperative provides technical assistance to small
truckers and attempts to pool trucking capacity and transport demand. Ilem-
bership in the cooperative is voluntary.
(d) Road User Charges and i^aintenance Costs
2.16      Apart from income taxes, turnover taxes and import duties on
vehicles and spare parts, special taxes on road transport activities are
collected in the form of:
(i) annual license fees and taxes on the capacity of
commercial vehicles ("Patente");
(ii) taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel.
On a bituminous surface road, these taxes account for about 15% of auto-
mobile operating costs and 65, of those for trucks.



2.17      It is estimated that the revenues from these taxes generated by
the traffic on the project road during the course of its economic life will
amount to CFAF 450 million. These revenues would largely cover tlhe main-
tenance costs of the project road which are estimated at about CFAF 380
million during the same period (see Table 2 for details).

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.1       The highway network (19,300 km) is classified into three cate-
gories: national (primary), regional (secondary), and local (tertiary or
feeder) (see Table 3). The only asphalt road in the country links Bangui
and Damara (76 km). The total length of the network has not increased
over the past decade, but roads have been reclassified according to eco-
nomic importance and traffic densities.
B. Characteristics and Growth of Traffic
3.2       Bangui is the focus for road transport in the country.  Foreign
trade and transit to and from Chad are linked to its port. The capital is
the center of the local industry and the largest market for staple crops.
3.3       The vehicle fleet is small and was estimated at about 8,500
vehicles in January 1967 (see Table 4) compared with about 6,000 vehicles
in 1962. Two-thirds of the fleet was registered in Bangui. The average
number of motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in the CAR is 5.7 compared
with 7.2 in East Cameroon. Two large transport companies alone accounted
for over 50% of the total trucking capacity.
3.h       Statistics on the growth of road traffic are not available.
Indirect evidence such as port traffic at Bangui or imports of transport
equipment and fuel (Tables 1, 5 and 6) is difficult to evaluate but seems
to indicate that growth rates have been low in recent years.
3.5       In the past, traffic counts have been carried out at a few points
but no attempt was made to evaluate the results systematically. In 1967
a new series of counts was started on both the Bangui-M'baiki and the Bangui-
Damara roads and the Government plans to repeat these counts at regular time
intervals. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that sound pro-
cedures for traffic counts and central processing of results will be
established as a basis for future road investments.
C. Highway Administration
3.6       Primary and secondary roads, which totaled about 3,h00 km in
1967, are administered and maintained by the Directorate of Public Wtlorks.
More than 15,000 km of local roads, predominantly with a low traffic den-
sity, are under the administration of the Ministry of Agriculture and
local authorities (see Table 3). The international link Bangui-Damara-
Batangafo-Fort Archambault is maintained by ATEC (see para. 2.6).
3.7       In 1967 the UN was reorganized, and now comprises two director-
ates, one for planning and construction and one for maintenance. The dir-
ectorate of planning and construction, which is administered and staffed



- 7 -
by French engineers provided by FAIC, operates efficiently. The director-
ate of highway maintenance is staffed by local personnel with limited
experience in maintenance operations.
3.8       It is the intention of the Government to replace gradually the
expatriates by local technical personnel. As this personnel is lacking
at present, there is a great need for training facilities. Senior per-
sonnel are trained abroad, generally in France. For the intermediate
level, personnel training is available at the Public Works College in
Fort Lamy in Chad and in Libreville in Gabon. A training center for
foremen has recently been established in Bangui.  FED and FAC are each
contributing 50% of the cost of this training center.  The number of
CAR nationals who graduated from these training centers has been total-
ly insufficient up to now to fill the need for technical personnel.  It
is to be expected that this situation will slowly improve as the first
graduates from the Bangui training center become available in the middle
of 1969.
D.1 Highway Planning and Finance
3.9       The country's Four-Year Development Plan 1967-70 proposes road
investment totalling about USp10 million and includes about 600 km of
roads needing rehabilitation. The improvement of the project road, as
weU as the Sibut-Bambari road which is the subject of a feasibility
study financed by the UNDP (see para.l.2), are included in the Plan.
3.10      Funds for road construction have been provided largely by FED,
and to a lesser extent by FAC. Since 1962 about US$o.5 million equivalent
has been spent each year on capital works.  Funds for road maintenance are
financed from the general budget; the appropriations have been insufficient
and substantial increases have been proposed in the Four-Year Plan. Funds
for the Bangui-Damara-Batangafo-Fort Archambault road are provided by con-
tributions from ATEC (see para.3.6).
E. Highway Engineering and Construction
3.11      Road design is carried out by consultants on an ad hoc basis, how-
ever, the directorate of planning and construction has made progress towards
preparing standard specifications and contracts. The design standards for
the project road (see Table 7) have been selected with a view to minimizing
highway construction costs, and are adequate for existing and foreseeable
traffic over the next ten years. Road construction is carried out by pri-
vate contracting firms. 3ecause of the very low volume of work in the past
five years, most of the foreign contracting firms have closed their local
offices. Contracts for which funds are provided by FED limit the bidding
to contractors from the European Economic Community.



F. Maintenance
3.12      Maintenance is mechanized, except on local and feeder roads where
labor-intensive methods are employed. Although the maintenance budget has
been increased during the past years, maintenance is still inadequate.
This has led to high costs of transportation and unreliable road connec-
tions. The maintenance of the local roads is virtually nonexistent.
3.13      Maintenance by the DPW is limited to earth and laterite roads as
the only asphalt road in the country is being maintained by ATEC. The total
budget for maintenance has gradually been increased from 260 million CFAF
in 196h to 370 million CFAF in 1967. For 1968 the maintenance budget has
been raised to 400 miUion CFAF. Since 1967 the expenditures for main-
tenance have been broken down by road section and other components; this
aUows a better judgment of the efficiency of maintenance cperations.
3.14      The road network maintenance study (see para. 1.2) is at present
in its preliminary stage. The final report of this study may be expected
at the end of August 1969. The consultants are required to report on
existing maintenance practices and to recommend improvements. A five-
year maintenance program for the national highway network will be prepared
by the consultants to ensure a satisfactory level of serviceability of this
network.
3.15      The consultants for the road maintenance study will also review
the present accounting procedures and recommend improvements. During credit
negotiations, the Governnent gave an assurance that sufficient appropriations
for highway maintenance will be made available and that the conclusions and
recommendations of the consultants will be discussed between the Governnent
and the Association with a view to agreeing upon an appropriate organiza-
tion of the highway maintenance.

4. THE PROJECT
A. Description
4.1       The project consists of the following:
a. Reconstruction of the Bangui-M'baiki Road (102 km); including
(M)  supplementary engineering works carried out by the
DPW in 1968; and,
(ii) supervision of construction works by the DPW.
b. Provision of equipment to maintain the road.
Reconstruction of the Bangui-M'baiki Road (see Map)
4.2       The present road connects Bangui, the capital of the CAR, with
M'baiki. M'baiki is the center of a region with a high agricultural and
forestry potential. The road traverses gently rolling terrain which is
covered by dense vegetation. The horizontal alignnent is generally good.
Drainage of the road is poor because the road surface is mostly below the
surrounding ground and the existing drainage channels do not provide a
proper run-off. A few sections of the road are exposed to flooding by
nearby streams. The roadway is generally about 5 m wide. Some sections
have a thin lateritic surface course, but because of lack of maintenance
not much of this surface course is left. The road has generally deteri-
orated to such a state that it is impassable after rain, even for light
vehicles. Five existing reinforced concrete bridges will have to be
replaced because of insufficient width.
4.3       The project consists of realigning the sections with sharp curves
and the sections in which new bridges have to be built. The road has to be
raised to improve the drainage. The pavement width would be widened to
6 m. The whole length of the road would have a cement stabilized base and
a double bituminous surface treatment.
Supplementary Engineering Works and_Supervision of Construction
4.h       The consulting engineering firm of SAUTI carried out detailed
engineering of the project during 1965 and 1966. This work was financed
by FED. The detailed engineering was, however, not sufficiently complete
for cost estimates and bidding documents to be prepared. In 1968 the DPW
supplemented bridge designs, carried out additional soil surveys and made
additional topographic surveys where realignments were required. Detailed
engineering, including bidding documents and cost estimates, have now been
satisfactorily completed. The total cost of the additional soul and topo-
graphic surveys amounted to $40,000.



- 10 -
4.5       The Government has requested that the construction works be super-
vised by the DPW. The directorate of planning and construction of the DPW
has sufficient experience in the supervision of the construction of this
type of road. Qualified engineers and technical personnel from France have
been made available to the CAR under a FAC technical assistance program.
IDA obtained assurances during credit negotiations that during the construc-
tion of the work, experienced staff for supervision will be kept available,
and if determined necessary by the Association, they will be strengthened
by the employment of consultants.
Procurement of Highway Maintenance Equipment
4.6       Existing highway maintenance equipment is not adequate to ensure
proper maintenance of the project road after its completion. As the find-
ings of the consultants for the maintenance study will not be available in
their final form before the end of August 1969, procuremEnt of maintenance
equipment and spare parts should at this stage be confined to that needed
for the maintenance of the project road.  To this end, an amount of
US$250,000 being the foreign cost component of this equipment, is in-
cluded in the Credit.
B. Cost Estimates

*/ The cost of supervision covers only cost of transportation of supervising
staff on the site, equipment for a soils laboratory on the site and the
salaries of two expatriate assistant engineers. The cost of supervision by
other technical staff is not included, as the engineering services are
provided by the FAC technical assistance program.

4.8       The cost estimate for the reconstruction of the road was prepared
by the DPW on the basis of present construction costs in the CAR. The
foreign exchange component is based on an analysis of these construction
costs andis estimated at 75%. The cost of the maintenance equipment has
been estimated on the basis of recent equipment purchases by the CAR. The
foreign cost component for this equipment is the estimated C.I.F. cost at
Bangui. The estimates for the reconstruction costs and the maintenance
equipment are in line with costs in neighboring countries.
4.9       The cost of topographic and soil surveys, performed by the DPW in
1968, which were required to supplement the detailed engineering, amounted
to US$40,000 of which the foreign exchange component is estimated at
US$20,000. The cost of prequalification of bidders by the French consulting
firm BCEOM, also performed in 1968, which amounted to US$3,000, was entirely
in foreign currency. Financing of the foreign exchange component of the
cost of the topographic and soil surveys and the prequalification of con-
tracting firms, amounting to US$23,000, is included in the Credit. The con-
sulting firm BCEOM will be requested by the Government to evaluate the bids,
if the DPJ's analysis of bids were to result in a recommendation to award
the contract for other than the lowest priced bid. The cost of supervision
by the DPW and the consultants' services is estimated at US$80,000, of
which the foreign exchange component is estimated at 50%.
C. Execution and Financing
4.10      Construction of the road will commence in mid-1969 and will be
undertaken by a single contractor. The construction period will be 30
months running over two complete dry seasons; construction should be com-
pleted early in 1972. Construction of the project road will be awarded as
a single contract on the basis of the Associationts guidelines for inter-
national competitive bidding.
4.11      The maintenance equipment will be procured through international
competitive bidding. Equipment deliveries will start towards the beginning
of 1971, allowing sufficient time for operators to be trained on the new
equipment before maintenance of the new road is required.
4.12      On the assumption that construction will start in mid-1969 and
allowing a 30 month schedule, annual IDA disbursements are expected to
be as follows:
1969      1970      1971       1972     1973    Totai
US$ in thousands           800       1,200     1,500      500      200*/  4,2!Dfl
*/ Funds to be retained from contractor for one year warranty period.



- 12 -
4.13      The Governjent indicated during negotiations that it will make
available local funds as needed.
4.11      Disbursements for construction will be made on the basis of the
contractor's monthly statements. For road construction the Association
will pay 75% of all construction services. For equipment and spare parts
it will pay the foreign cost component.  For supplementary engineering,
the consultants' services and the cost of supervision as included in the
project cost, the Association would pay the estimated foreign exchange
part, estimated at 50% of the total of these costs. Any surplus remaining
in the credit account would be available for cancellation.

5. ECOi;OMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. Service Area of the Bangui-1M' baiki Road
5.1       The project road links Bangui, capital of the CAR with M'baiki,
chief town of the Lobaye province. It is part of one of the main road
connections to Cameroon.
5.2       Lobaye is one of the economically most active provinces of the
CAR; with a share of only seven per cent of the total population, it con-
tributes at present an estimated 15à to the country's GDP. The province
is the principal producer of coffee and, so fari, the only producer of
rubber and timber. It has rich potential for production of palm oil and
other agricultural products.
5.3       The forest industry has expanded rapidly in recent years.  Tim-
ber production increased from 112,000 m-- of logs in 1960 to 170,000 mni in
1967. There are seven sawmills in the country, all within reach of the
project road.  The output of timber from these mills is almost entirely
transported by road to Bangui for further processing or export to Chad.
A negligible amount of log exports to Europe are floated on the Lobaye-
Oubangui river system to Brazzaville and thence by rail to Pointe Noire.
5.4       Several development projects which are being carried out in
the Lobaye province are likely to enhance the importance of an improved
road link between Bangui and M' baiki in the near future:
(i)  Feeder roads with a total length of about 115 km will
be constructed to the south of the Bangui-M'baiki road.
The project is being financed by FED and is mainly aimed
at facilitating logging operations and agricultural pro-
duction in the service area of the project road.
(Ji)  Agricultural production of certain commodities will be
increased by a FED financed plantation program. Exist-
ing pepper plantations will be enlarged and a new palm
oil plantation will be established on both sides of the
project road. It is planned to install an oil mill at
a later stage.
(iii)  The French company Leroy has been awarded a new logging
concession of 50,000 ha to the west of M'baiki. A private
feeder road from the concession to the Lobaye river has
been constructed and production has started in the second
half of 1968. It is planned to produce 10,000 m3 of sawn
timber and 20,000 m3 of logs annually.



- 14 -
(iv)  The Lobaye river has been improved by ATEC and it is now
navigable throughout the year. This has considerably fa-
cilitated logging operatlons in the Lobaye province and
additional permits will be issued shortly. Although log
exports will not be routed via Bangui, the growth of log-
ging activities will certainly increase the volume of
general traffic on the project road.
5.5       A rapid development of the forest industry is taking place in
the Haute Sangha province, west of the Lobaye. With financial assistance
from FED, the Sangha river is being improved and a new port will be con-
structed at Nola. Two concessions totalling some 200,000 ha have already
been awarded and additional permits are expected to be issued soon. The
Sangha province is not within the direct service area of the proposed
project, but increased development efforts in this region will certainly
have a positive impact on traffic on the Bangui-II'baiki road, which is
the first section of the only overland link between the capital and the
Sangha province.
B. Traffic
.6       Traffic counts on the project road were undertaken by the Gov-
ernnent's Planning Office from April 1967 to March 1968 and supplemented
by SAUTI in November and December 1967,. They provide information on the
total volume of traffic, but give little details as to the traffic compo-
sition and its origin and destination. Taking into account seasonal
variations and decreasing traffic densities from Bangui towards H'baiki,
the average daily traffic (ADT) over the total length of the project road
is estimated at 80 vehicles in 1968 with trucks and buses accounting for
about 70% of all movements.  Traffic is evenly distributed in both dir-
ections.
5.7       Traffic groi-th on thle project road over the past five years has
probably been higher than on most of the other roads in the country and
is estimated at 10% per annum.  Dased on a review of the overall develop-
ment targets of the country, the expected growth of population and the
probable increase of agricultural and industrial production in Lobaye,
the consultants have formulated two alternative projections of traffic
growth on the Bangui-U1baiki road, i.e. rates of 15% and 10%a per annum
for the first decade after completion of construction of the road, and
5% per annum for the second decade for both alternative projections.
The higher rate of 15%o is based on a number of overly optimistic as-
sumptions as to the development of agricultural and industrial produc-
tion. As there is little evidence that this will materialize in the
near future, a traffic growth of 105o per annum during the first 10 years,
and of 5% per annum during the remaining 10 years of the economic life of
the project has been assumed in the economic evaluation of the project.

C. Econonic Benefits
5.8       The improvement of the Bangui-M'baiki road would generate eco-
nomic benefits principally in the form of a reduction in vehicle operating
costs, increased agricultural production due to an improved and more re-
liable access to markets in the capital city and time savings accruing to
vehicle occupants and cargo.
5.9       The quantitative evaluation of expected benefits has been con-
fined to directly measurable benefits, i.e. vehicle operating savings.
Based on the consultants' estimates, operating costs for various types
of vehicles are expected to decrease by about 35 to 45%, yielding bene-
fits of about CFAF 6.8 (US¢2.7) per car-km and CFAF 33.0 (US¢13.4) per
truck-km (Table 8). These are in line with other Bank/IDA. financed pro-
jects in West Africa and are reasonable. Discounted over a period of
20 years, the total measurable benefits yield an economic return of about
14%.
5.10      To test the sensitivity of the rate of return to changes in the
assumed traffic growth, an alternative rate of return calculation was made
with an assumed growth rate of 5" per annum throughout the economie life
of the road.  This gave a rate of return on the investment of about 10%.
Taking account of the scarcity of data which has led to the exclusion of
other additional benefits from the analysis, the project appears to be
justified, even on the basis of the lower rate of traffic growth.

6. RECOENDM\JDATIO!i
6.1       During credit negotiations the Governnent agreed to:
(i) make available experienced staff for supervision of
the construction of the project road, if necessary
through assistance by consultants (para. 4.5);
(ii)  establish proper procedures for collecting and
processing traffic data (para. 3.5);
(iii)  appropriate adequate funds for highway mainte-
nance and discuss the conclusions and recommenda-
tions of the consultants with the Association,
with a view to agreeing upon an appropriate
organization of the highway maintenance (para. 3.15).
6.2       As the project is technically and economically sound, it
provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of US$4.2 million equiv-
alent to the Central African Republic.
