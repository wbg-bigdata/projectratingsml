FISHERIES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report contains the appraisal of a fisheries project in
Indonesia, for which an IDA credit of US$3.5 million is proposed. The
project, the first by the Bank Group in this field in Indonesia, would
be directed at export of skipjack tuna. The fisheries sector in Indonesia
consists mainly of traditional small-scale operations except in the Sulawesi
area where there is a profitable commercial skipjack fishing industry. The
Celebes Sea has excellent skipjack resources, which are virtually unex-
ploited. Since world demand for skipjack is increasing, Indonesia is in
a good position to build up an export industry. This fits well in the
Government's agricultural development strategy, which gives high priority
to foreign exchange earning projects.
ii.       The project would be located at Aer Tembaga, a fishing port near
Menado, the capital of North Sulawesi. The project is the first phase of
a skipjack export program. It consists of a limited expansion of fishing
operations during the next 5 years and would supply the experience needed
to determine subsequent phases of the program. The project involves the
construction, equipment and operation of (a) ice-making, freezing and
storage facilities; (b) 30 pole and line skipjack fishing vessels of the
30-gross-ton type; and (c) two refrigerated carriers for the transport of
frozen skipjack to overseas markets (most likely Japan). It would also
provide technical assistance. The total project cost is about US$4.3
million. The proposed IDA credit would cover the foreign exchange compo-
ient (UJS$3.5 million), which is about 80%.
iii.      The proposed ice-making, freezing and storage facilities, half
of the fishing vessels, and the two carriers would be operated by the Aer
Tembaga unit (Unit) of the State Fisheries Corporation - Eastern Division
(corporation). Management of the Unit would need to be strengthened by the
addili n of four experts. The remaining 15 fishing vessels would be op-
erated by several private companies, which would be provided credit facil-
ities to acquire the boats.
iv.       Proctlrement would be handled by the office of the Directorate
General of Fisheries. Contracts would be awarded on the basis of inter-
iatiuna  :ompetitive bidding, except those for some small items, amounting
in total to at most US$30,000. It is possible that Indonesian shipyards
would win the awards for the construction of the hulls, since Indonesian
prices are significantly lower than those of foreign tenders. In this case
the foreign exchange component would be about 70% (US$3.0 million) and the
balance of the IDA credit would then be canceled.
v.        The proposed IDA credit would cover the foreign exchange compo-
nent of the Unit's investment and the investment in the private fishing
vessels.  To cover the full cost of the Unit's investment, the Government



- ii -
would supplement the IDA funds earmarked for the Unit (US$2.8 million)
with its own funds and would use the total to (a) increase the equity
of the Corporation by Rp 200 million; (b) provide a medium-term loan
of Rp 100 million, to be repaid in 4 years at an interest rate of 12%;
and (c) provide the Unit with a long-term loan to finance the Rp 856
million balance of the investments. The long-term loan would be repaid
over a 15-year period, including a 5-year grace period, at an interest
rate of 12%.
vi.       The remainder of the proposed IDA credit is US$0.7 million and
would be relent through State camercial banks to private fishing entre-
preneurs to cover the full cost of the 15 fishing vessels. These loans
would be repaid in 10 years, without a grace period. Working capital would
be provided by the private companies out of their ovn resources.
vii.      The proposed project would result in shipJack exports of about
10,000 ton annually, and in net foreign exchange earnings of at least
US$1.3 million annually. On a conservative basis, the economic rate of
return of the project is 26%.
viii.     The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$3.5 mil-
lion on standard terms.



INDONESIA
FISEERIES PROJECT
I.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has applied for an IDA credit to help
finance the expansion of the North Sulawesi fisheries. The proposed project
would provide for the construction, equipment, and operation of (a) shore
facilities, (b) fishing vessels, and (c) refrigerated fish carriers; it
would also provide technical assistance. The project would result in ex-
ports of about 10,000 ton of skipjack tuna per annum.
1.02      A mission of the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program that visited
Indonesia in March/April 1969 helped the Government prepare the project.
This report is based on the findings of an IDA mission composed of Messrs.
L. Helmers and P. Pohland (IDA) and Messrs. F. Kada and C. Story (Consul-
tants), which visited Indonesia in November 1969.
1.03      After this appraisal report was completed, the Government of
Indonesia adopted an exchange reform that substantially unified its ex-
change rate system and resulted in some reduction in the dollar equivalent
of the rupiah for most foreign trade transactions. Effective April 17,
19'T0, the two exchange markets - the Bonus Export (BE) and the Devisa
Pelengkap or Complementary Foreign Exchange (DP) markets - were merged at
Rp 378 per US dollar, the rate recently prevailing in the DP market. This
rate now applies to all foreign trade and exchange transactions except for
sales of aid funds provided by foreign governments for program imports and
related services, which remain at the BE rate of Rp 326 per US dollar.
Tile reform includes a simplification of export tax arrangements and the
elimination of the export over-price system. The effective exchange rate
adjustment thus differs for different export and import commodities. Since
the DP rate had been applied to non-trade receipts and to payments for non-
essential imports, the exchange reform does not affect these items.
1.04      The new exchange rate does not change substantially the project's
financial and economic returns.  The total project cost was estimated at
Us$4.3 million, with a foreign exchange component of about 80% (US$3.5
million). Because of the exchange rate reform, the rupiah equivalent of
the foreign exchange cost has increased by 16%. Net export proceeds will
increase by i,,% and net revenues by about 14%. (Net revenues will not in-
creasf by the full 16% because fuel oil will cost more than projected.)
Since the in'^repse in cost will be compensated by the increase in net rev-
enues, the overall financial and economic rates of return will remain sub-
stantially as stated in the report.

II.   BACKGROUND
A. General
2.91      With its 3,000 islands and a total land surface of 1.9 million
km , Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago (See Maps). Its popula-
tion is about 118 million; the growth rate, which i8 increasing, is at
present 2.4% per annum. The per capita gross domestic product is about
US$80. The islands of Java (population, 75 million) and Sumatra (19 million)
are the most important, followed by Kalimantan (5 million), and Sulawesi
(8.5 million). The economic development of the smaller islands is just
starting. Agriculture plays a dominant role in the Indonesian economy,
accounting for nearly half the net domestic product, employing approximately
70% of the labor force, and contributing around 75% of merchandise exports.
2.02      A war for independence, internal conflicts, nationalization of
most foreign-owned enterprises, and a severe inflation have curtailed econom-
ic development since World War II. In the last decade, agricultural exports
declined and food imports increased. The present Government took over in
1966 and has succeeded, to a large extent, in stabilizing the currency; the
rate of inflation was brought down from 85% in 1968 to 9% in 1969. The
Government has given priority to agriculture, particularly rice production.
An IDA credit of US$5.0 million for an irrigation project to raise rice
production was made in 1968 (Credit No. 127-IND). The Government is also
giving special attention to rehabilitation of estates to increase foreign
exchange earnings. An IDA credit of US$16.0 million was made in 1968 for
the rehabilitation of rubber and palmoil estates in North Sumatra (Credit
No. 155-IND) and another similar project has been appraised. Within the
overall strategy of agricultural development, fisheries play an important
role. Fish is the major source of animal protein for the population and
also a potential source of export earnings. The Government, therefore,
attaches high priority to an expansion of fisheries to provide for increased
local consumption as well as for exports.
B. The Fisheries Sector
2.03      Total fish landings in Indonesia are about 1.2 million ton, with
marine fisheries accounting for about 60% (0.70 million ton), fresh water
fish catches for about 30% (0.35 million ton), and inland fish cultivation
for about 10% (0.12 million ton). About 95% of the total fish production
is salted or dried; the remainder is marketed fresh. Production has been
stagnant in the last 5 years (Annex 1). Imports and exports of fish are
negligible.
2.04      The average per capita consumption of fish was about 10.2 kg in
1968. This consumption is low when considered in the light of the acute



- 3 -
shortage of other animal protein in Indonesia and the fisheries potential.
Per capita consumption in Malaysia is nearly three times as high.
2.05      Currently, some 900,000 fishermen are employed in domestic
fisheries. They represent, together with their families, some 5% of the
population. Fishing vessels employed are mainly sailing and rowing boats.
There are only about 4,000 small motorized vessels out of a total fleet of
about 260,000 (Annex 2).
2.06      The annual catch in the traditional fishery sector is low - about
900 kg per fisherman. The marine and inland fishery is based on very small-
scale operations. Except for the introduction of nylon nets, no significant
improvement has occurred since World War II in catching techniques, the
types of fishing vessels employed, or in fish marketing and distribution.
Private fishing companies, except in Aer Tembaga, are active only in shrimp
and pearl fishing. The State Fisheries Corporations have been too small and
have spread their resources too thinly to contribute significantly to pro-
duction, or to demonstrate the value of using improved fishing methods.
Annex 3 describes the Government fisheries administration.
C. Fish Resources and Fisheries Development
3.07     Annex 4 reviews Indonesia's fish resources and the Government's
fisheries development policy. The Government has thus far identified only
one specific project, described and assessed below - the expansion of skipjack
fishing for export in the Sulawesi area - which has excellent fishing grounds
for skipjack, a small tuna species. The Government attaches high priority
to this project because it would increase foreign exchange earnings.
2.08      Annex 5 describes current skipjack operations in the Sulawesi
area and possibilities of expansion. Six private entrepreneurs operate 27
fishing vessels out of Aer Tembaga; the State Fisheries Corporation - Eastern
Division operates 23 vessels, of which 10 are operated by the Aer Tembaga
Unit. The total skipjack production of the private fishing companies and
the Corporation is about 5,000 ton per annum. Fishing operations, described
in detail in Annexes 5 and 6, are carried out with vessels of the 5-to-15-
gross-ton (G.T.) class.
2.09      Since present production satisfies local demand in Sulawesi, any
additional skipjack production would need to be marketed elsewhere. The
most profitable outlet at present is Japan. Since the present fishing
vessels are too small, larger boats are needed to exploit more distant skip-
Jack and bait resources. Boats of the 30-G.T. class are proposed for this
purpose. The most suitable fishing port for the expansion is Aer Tembaga,
where no major harbor construction works are necessary.
2.10      Annex 7A discusses the operations of the State Fisheries Corpora-
tion - Eastern Division. The Corporation was created in 1969 to provide
centralized supervision of the Aer Tembaga, Makassar, Ternate and Ambon
Units. Such supervision has not yet been established, and procurement,



-4-
bait catching, accounting, and sales arrangements show deficiencies. Fish-
ing operations, however, are carried out on a sound professional basis.
For the organization chart of the Corporation, see Annex TB. Unaudited
profit and loss statements and balance sheets for 1967 and 1968 appear in
Annexes 7C and 7D.
2.11      Annex 8 presents an assessment of world tuna production, consump-
tion, and expected price trends. World demand for skipjack is increasing
and prices are likely to rise by at least 3% per annum.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Description
3.01      The project is the first phase of a skipjack export program.
It would provide for a limited expansion of fishing operations during the
next 5 years and would supply experience needed to determine subsequent
phases of the program. The project involves the construction, equipment,
and operation of freezing and cold storage facilities at Aer Tembaga,
30 wooden pole and line fishing vessels of the 30-G.T. type, and 2 carriers
to export the skipjack. Fifteen of the fishing vessels, the shore facil-
ities, the carriers, and the marketing of the frozen skipjack would be
managed by the Aer Tembaga Unit of the State Fisheries Corporation - East-
ern Division. 1/ Management of the Unit would be strengthened by the addition
of four experts (para 4.03). Private entrepreneurs at Aer Tembaga would
be offered credit facilities to acquire the remaining 15 fishing vessels.
3.02      Phasing of the project is related to the timing of boat con-
struction, management capability to handle the expansion, and the time
needed to demonstrate to private companies that skipjack fishing operations
for export are profitable. The phasing would be as follows:
Fishing Vessels (30-G.T. Boats)         Carriers (500 G.T. to 600 G.T.)
Private Companies    AT Unit    Total                   AT Unit
1972                           4            4
1973          -                6            6                    _
1974          5                5           10                    1
1975         10                -           10                    1
15              15           30                    2
The shore facilities would be constructed in 1971.  The first exports of
skipjack to overseas markets (most likely Japan; Annex 5, para 5) would

- 5 -
be in 1972, with the transport undertaken by a charter company; carrier
operations would start in 1974. Fishing operations by private companies
would start in 1974, after the Unit has demonstrated that these operations
are profitable. The above phasing has been confirmed during negotiations;
changes would have to be approved by IDA. The time schedule of project
operations is presented in Annex 9.
B. Technical Features
3.03      The shore facilities would consist of an ice-making plant with
an annual capacity of 12,600 ton with adequate storage, a freezing plant
with an annual capacity to handle about 10,000 ton of fish, and a cold
storage of 600-ton capacity for keeping the fish until it is transported.
The facilities would be constructed on the site presently used and owned
by the Unit. Electricity would be generated by the Unit's power plant,
and water would be obtained from an existing tubewell. Improvement of
the boatyard and the mechanical workshop and the extension of the jetty
are also included in the cost estimates. Annex lOA presents outline speci-
fications.
3.04      The 30-G.T. pole and line boats would be of wooden construction.
This type is operating successfully in Japan and the South Carolina Islands.
Steel was considered but there is no existing design for a steel boat of
this class; furthermore, repair and maintenance would be difficult in Aer
Tembaga. Each of about 12 well-experienced Indonesian shipyards would have
the capacity to build the proposed annual number of fishing vessels (para
3.02) within 6 months. In addition, the yard at Aer Tembaga is well ex-
perienced in repairing such boats.
3.05      The proposed 30-G.T. boats would have an overall length of
about 21 m, a breadth of about 3.80 m, and a depth of about 1.80 m.
They would be equipped with a main diesel engine of 150 hp, allowing a
service speed of 8.5 knots. The fish hold would store about 12 m3 skip-
Jack stowed with ice. Technical equipment would include shortwave radio-
telephone and compass. Vessels would each carry a crew of 30 and be able
to operate efficiently for trips lasting 5 to 6 days. Outline specifica-
tions and drawings appear in Annexes lOB and 10C.
3.06      Two fish carriers of steel construction and with an overall
lerl'tIi of about 50 to 53 m, a breadth of 8 to 9 m, and a depth of 4.0
to 4.5 m  ould be procured under the project.  Purchase of one larger
vessel has been considered but, to ensure flexibility of operation, two
smaller vessels would be more effective. They would be able to trans-
port about 12,000 ton of frozen skipjack annually. A main 1,200-hp
diesel engine would permit a cruising speed of 13 knots. Two 100-hp
auxiliary engines would generate power for lighting, refrigeration, and
cargo winches. The cargo hold would stow about 500 G.T. to 600 G.T. of
skipjack at a temperature of minus 200C. The vessels would be equipped
with modern navigation gear, a complete communirations system, radar,



- 6 -
echo-sounder, hydraulic winches, and various deck machinery. They would
carry a complement of 13 each and be able to travel approximately 7,800
miles (Annex 10D). These vessels would have to be procured abroad.
3.07      Government consultants are preparing designs for the shore
facilities, the fishing vessels, and the carriers. Detailed plans and
tender documents in this connection would be submitted to IDA for approval
before bids are invited. Assurances to this effect have been obtained
during negotiations.
3.08      Three expatriate experts (chief of project operations, master
fisherman and chief of shore facilities) and a qualified Indonesian ac-
countant would be appointed to strengthen management of the Unit (para
4.03). Annex 9 shows the timing of the appointments of the expatriate
experts.
C. Cost Estimates
3.09      Total cost of the project is estimated at Rp 1,404 million
(us$4.3 million), as presented in the following table (see also Annex 10).
The foreign exchange component is about Rp 1,141 million (US$3.5 million),
or 80%, and includes foreign construction cost of fishing vessels. If
Indonesian shipyards win the awards for hull construction, the foreign
exchange component would be about 70% (US$3.0 million).

3.10      Price increases of 3% per annum over the 5-year phasing of the
project have been included in the estimates. A contingency of 10% has been
added for unforeseen price increases. Estimates for ice-making, freezing,
cold storage, and workshop equipment are based on quotations by Japanese
manufacturers; the cost of buildings has been estimated by Government con-
sultants and was verified during appraisal with private Indonesian builders.
Quotations for the cost of the hull for the fishing vessels have been pro-
vided by Indonesian shipyards; the cost of the engine and other equipment
for the boats is based on import prices. Estimates for the carriers were
obtained from Japanese shipyards.
D. Proposed Project Financing
3.11      The following table summarizes the proposed financing of project
investments:

Total                         1,404,267         4,307       100
The proposed IDA credit of US$3.5 million, representing about 80% of the
total cost, would cover entirely the foreign exchange component of proj-
ect investments. The balance would be provided by Government and sub-
borrowers. The proposed financing plans for the Unit and private companies
are discussed in more detail below (paras 5.11 to 5.15).
E. Procurement
3.12      Centralized procurement would be handled by the Directorate
General. This office would procure hulls, engines, buildings, and equip-
ment for sub-borrowers (Unit and private companies), using international
competitive bidding procedures. The official foreign exchange rate would
be used for bid comparisons. All awards would be subject to approval by
IDA.



-9-
3.13      International bidding would be employed for procurement of hulls.
While contracts for the hulls are expected to be awarded to Indonesian
shipyards, as Indonesian prices are significantly lover than foreign quota-
tions, it would help ensure effective local bidding. Should Indonesian
shipyards win the contracts for hull construction, the savings in foreign
exchange would amount to as much as US$500,000. In this event, the amount
provided for in the IDA credit would be canceled. The first tender would
invite firm bids for 10 hulls (vessels to become operative in 1972 and
1973) and would ask for quotations for 10 more hulls to be delivered be-
fore 1974 and 10 more before 1975. The Directorate General would reserve
the right either to exercise these options (or any part thereof) or to in-
vite new bids.
3.14      Procurement for engines would follow the same schedule and pro-
cedures as those for the hulls. The bid documents would stipulate that an
adequate inventory of spare parts would be maintained at Aer Tembaga. Short-
wave radio commanications equipment to be installed in the boats and on shore
would also be subject to international competitive bidding. The Directorate
General would make the engines and the communications equipment available to
the shipyards for installation. International tendering would also be under-
taken for the carriers, but only after the Government and IDA have agreed on
the advisability of carrier operations (para 5.09). Additional small equip-
menl such as bait nets would be procured locally by the Directorate General
amount would be too small for international competitive bidding.
F. Disbursement
.15      For imported goods, IDA would disburse 100% of the cif cost
against shipping documents. For other goods, IDA would disburse the for-
eign exchange component, estimated at 20% for buildings and hulls constructed
in Indonesia. For expatriate staff, IDA would cover 100% of salaries. Dis-
bursement would take place on presentation by the Directorate General of
substantiating payment documents.
3.16      The disbursement schedule would be as follows:

3.17      If the project is completed for less than the credit amount, any
savings under the credit would be canceled. The IDA credit amount earmarked
for the private fishing vessels would be provided to the Unit for the
acquisition of these vessels if the Government proves that, notwithstanding
its best efforts, it could not find interested private parties. IDA funds
for the carriers would be canceled if time charter proves more economical
than carrier operations (para 5.09). Agreement to this effect has been
obtained during negotiations.
IV. ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING ARRANGEMENTS
A. Organization and Management
4.01      The State Fisheries Units (para 2.10) operate under the law gov-
erning State Enterprises (Law No. 19, 1960). As such, they have legal and
financial autonomy. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
the legal status of the Aer Tembaga Unit would not be changed without prior
consultation with IDA throughout the term of the subloan.
4.02      Although fishing is reasonably well undertaken, overall manage-
ment of the Unit reflects the limited experience of its executives. In
particular, procurement, bait catching, and sales arrangements show serious
deficiencies. Accounting is very unsatisfactory since it does not provide
any useful management information but merely keeps a record of payments and
revenues. The Unit's accounts, moreover, have not been audited. The credit
is, nevertheless, recommended since the project is essentially intended to
promote skipjack operations by the private sector and it would take at least
a year to carry out an acceptable audit. Assurances have been obtained
during negotiations that audited figures would be made available to IDA in
1971 for the financial year 1970 (para 4.14).
4.03      Four experts, satisfactory to IDA, would be appointed by the
Aer Tembaga Unit on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA to strengthen
its management. The experts are:
(a) A chief of project operations;
(b) A master fisherman;
(c) A chief of shore facilities; and
(d) A qualified accountant.
The appointment of the chief of project operations and the accountant and
their entry on duty would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit.
The other two experts would be appointed before the end of 1971 (Annex 9).



- 11 -
4.04      The chief of project operations would report to the Director of
the Unit. He would supervise the construction and operations of the ves-
sels and shore facilities and make the necessary sales and transport ar-
rangeinents for export of project output. He would also draw up a suita-
ble catch-sharing system.
4.05      The master fisherman would have the task of instructing the crews
in bait-fishing techniques and would supervise overall skipjack fishing
operations. The chief of shore facilities would supervise the repair,
maintenance, and operations of freezing and storage facilities. The ac-
countant would set up a new accounting system for the Unit and would be
responsible for providing management with timely information. The three
technical experts would be recruited from abroad and would be appointed
for a 3- to 5-year period (Annex 9). The accountant could probably be
recruited in Djakarta and the position would be permanent.
44.o6     To strengthen management of the State Fisheries Corporation -
Eastern Division at headquarters (Aer Tembaga), and to implement effective
control of the Units in Aer Tembaga, Makassar, Ternate and Ambon, a quali-
fied Indonesian auditor would be appointed. During negotiations, the Gov-
ernment has confirmed its intention to employ, as soon as possible, such
an internal auditor.
4.07      A project committee would be established to review periodically
;at least once per quarter) the progress of operations of the project. This
committee would consist of:
(a)  The Director General of Fisheries;
(b)  The D)irector of the State Fisheries Corporation -
Eastern Division;
(c)  The Chief of Project Operations;
(d)  A representative of the Central Bank; and
(e)  A representative of the Department of Finance.
The Chairman would be the Director General of Fisheries. This committee
would -view (a) tenders for construction of the shore facilities, fishing
vessels, and carriers; (b) appointment of appropriate expert staff; (c)
progress of fishing operations; (d) purchase price of the skipjack bought
from private entrepreneurs (para 4.18); (e) the economics of time charter
versus carrier operations (para 4.20); and (f) selection of private ap-
plicanits to wh')m credit facilities would be made available. Assurances
have been obtainied during negotiations on composition and functions of
the project committee.

B. Policies and Procedures for On-lending
On-lending to the Aer Tembaga Unit
4.o8      Out of the proceeds of the IDA credit, an amount of US$2.8 mil-
lion (Rp 915 million) would be made available to the Unit to cover the
foreign exchange component of its investment. The Government would sup-
plement the IDA funds with Rp 141 million from its own resources, making
a total of Rp 1,056 million. This would be provided to the Unit as fol-
lows: (a) an increase in the equity of the Unit by Rp 200 million (to
be derived from the proceeds of the IDA credit); and (b) a long-term loan
of Rp 856 million to the Unit (of which Rp 715 million derived from the
proceeds of the IDA credit) to finance the balance of the investments. In
addition, the Government would make available a medium term loan of Rp 100
million. The interest rates on the loans would be 12%, the rate currently
charged on loans to State enterprises. The Unit would repay the long-term
loan to the Government in 10 equal annual installments, following a 5-year
grace period, and the medium-term loan in 4 years. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations on the above financing arrangements.
On-lending to Private Fishing Companies
4.09      The rest of the proceeds of the IDA credit covers the full cost
of the 15 fishing vessels to be acquired by the private companies, totaling
US$0.7 million (Rp 225.9 million), if the hulls were to be constructed
abroad. It would be used by Government to make loans to these companies
for the full amount of the investment costs of the fishing vessels at the
Government's standard lending rate at the time the loans are made (that
rate is now 12%), to be repaid in 10 years without a grace period. If
the hulls were to be constructed in Indonesia, the IDA credit would cover
only the foreign exchange component of the vessels, totaling US$375,000
(Rp 122.2 million). In this case, the IDA funds would be supplemented by
Government funds to make loans for the full amount of the investment cost
of the fishing vessels. The private fishing operators would have to pro-
vide the necessary working capital from their own resources. During nego-
tiations, assurances have been obtained on these on-lending terms.
4.10      The subloans would be made through the intermediary of State com-
mercial banks. Four such banks are in the Aer Tembaga area and well ac-
quainted with the performance of private operators. The banks would scru-
tinize the loan applications of private entrepreneurs, provide information
to the project committee (para 4.07) on applicants' financial status, pros-
pects, and fishing experience.
4.11      The particulars of selected applicants would be submitted to
IDA, together with all pertinent financial and technical information.
Proposed sub-contracts with sub-borrowers would be subject to agreement
by IDA. Each sub-contract would include covenants limiting sub-borrowers'
future indebtedness and providing for the execution of fishing operations



- 13 -
under sound technical and financial conditions. Sub-borrowers would be
required to provide the fishing vessels as collateral for loan repayments.
4.12      The Government would discuss, with the commercial banks, terms and
conditions of on-lending. The conclusion of subsidiary agreements satis-
factory to IDA would be a precondition for disbursement of any IDA funds
for on-lending to private companies.
C. Audit Covenants
4.13      Private companies would submit annual audited profit and loss
statements to the banks from which they obtained loans. These statements
would be submitted to IDA within 6 months of the end of the calendar year.
4.14      The Unit's accounts would be kept in a form satisfactory to IDA
and audited by an independent auditor. An audited financial statement
would be presented to IDA within 4 months of the close of the financial
year. Assurances concerning the audit covenants have been obtained during
negotiations.
D. Operating Arrangements for the Fishing Vessels
4.15      The master fisherman would be fully employed by the Unit during
the first 2 years of his assignment (1972 and 1973) in teaching bait-catch-
lrg and fishing techniques to the crews of the new vessels and in supervis-
ing fleet operations. By 1974, his Indonesian counterpart should be able
to assume his responsibilities and the expatriate would then be able to
concentrate his efforts on the operations of the private fishing vessels,
which would then become operative. During this second phase of his assign-
ment, he would still be employed by the Unit, but working mainly with the
private vessels, introducing efficient fishing techniques and assuring a
steady supply of skipjack to the Unit.
4.16      It is a normal requirement that vessels be insured.  While fish-
ing vess'ls and carriers of the Unit would be covered, private entrepre-
neurs wolild also have to insure the fishing vessels they obtain under the
project. The Directorate General would negotiate with insurance companies,
on behalf of the Unit and interested private entrepreneurs to obtain reason-
able rates. Assurances have been obtained that an acceptable insurance
coverage would be maintained on all vessels throughout their useful life.
E. Skipjack Purchasing Arrangements
4.17      During the first 3 years of the project, it is expected that only
skipjack caught by the Unit's fishing vessels would be available for export.



- 14 -
The fishing vessels of the private companies would become operative in the
fourth year of the project, and the Unit would then secure increasing quan-
tities for export from private companies. At full development, the Unit
would catch 4,800 ton of skipjack a year and receive another 4,800 ton
from private operators. Net proceeds are expected to be US$155 per ton
out of a wholesale price in overseas markets of US$275 per ton. The
Unit would be able to pay about US$123 per ton to private companies.
The difference of US$32 per ton would cover operating costs, depreciation,
and a reasonable profit (15% financial return on Unit assets).
4.18      The price paid to the private operators would be reviewed
periodically by the project committee (para 4.07). The average purchase
price, to be computed at least annually by the Unit, would be equal to
the net proceeds of the skipjack export resulting from the Unit's opera-
tions, reduced by the costs of the Unit for freezing and storage, including
depreciation, and a 15% return on assets used for these purposes. This
procedure would guarantee that private operators would receive a price
that would be commensurate with export prices of skipjack. Assurances to
this effect have been obtained during negotiations.
F. Charter and Carrier Arrangements
4.19      The two carriers the Unit might have to acquire would become
operative in 1973 and 1974, respectively. As the Unit has no experience
in operating such carriers, it would be necessary to hire a charter com-
pany to manage the operations. Time charter arrangements would be made
for the years 1972 and 1973 to transport the frozen skipjack to overseas
markets (most likely Japan).
4.20      If undertaken, the management contract between the Unit and the
charter company would be a charter consigned, under which all operating
expenses would be paid by the Unit. The charter company would hire the
crews; purchase such items as fuel, lubricants, and food; and provide all
the services required for the smooth operation of the carriers. For these
services, the Unit would pay an annual management fee, estimated on the
basis of quotations obtained in Japan, at US$23,000 per carrier.  Negotia-
tions on charter arrangements would take place after a reevaluation of the
economics of time charter versus carrier operation is undertaken (para 5.09).
Assurances have been obtained that IDA would be consulted prior to the
conclusion of a charter agreement. If long-term charter arrangements prove
to be more economical, IDA funds for the carrier part of the project would
be canceled.



- 15 -
G. Sales Arrangements
4.21      Since it would, at present, be uneconomical for the Unit to es-
tablish an affiliate abroad to market skipjack, an agent would be appointed
on an annual basis. The agent would pay the Unit the skipjack price as
published in an official trade journal. For instance, in Japan the Yaizu
Fishing Port Authority publishes weekly skipjack ex-vessel prices, which
would be acceptable for the sales agreement. Assurances concerning the
sales arrangements have been obtained during negotiations.
V. OPERATING RESULTS
A. Catch Rates, Revenues and Operating Costs
Catch Rates
5.01      The estimated catch rate for each of the 30-G.T. fishing vessels
is 320 ton per annum. This estimate is based on 200 fishing days at an
average catch per fishing day of 1.6 ton. Catch rates with similar types
of vessel. but of slower speed, in the Palau area (South Carolina Islands),
are about 400 ton per annum, even though weather conditions are less favor-
able and ~he average number of fishing days is only about 150 per annum.
FtLrt1hermore, resources in the Aer Tembaga area are practically unexploited.
- c+eh rate of 320 ton for the 30-G.T. fishing vessels is, therefore, a
f- ;orvative long-term average.
,.02      The entire production of the 30 fishing vessels, about 10,000 ton,
would bc exported. Ex-vessel prices paid in Japan and California during the
last 5 years atre presented in Annex 8, which also discusses future trends
ir pr 3es  'The average ex-vessel price for skipjack in Japan last year was
about 1 ;%f.  ucr ton; the average price over the last 3 years was about
I'S+75 p-  tor.  Although world skipjack prices are likely to increase by
about 3%Z per annum (Annex 8), it is assumed, for purposes of this appraisal,
Lhr+ ex-vessel prices in Japan would remain stable at US$275 per ton.
Taxation
5.03      A regional development tax (ADO) of 10% of export proceeds is
levied. For skipjack, the local municipalities levy an additional charge of
5% of the sales proceeds. This charge is also used for development purposes
and is levied on the sales proceeds of any fish sold. Total taxation and
charges may thus be as high as 15% of fob value for skipjack. On this basis,
the net proceeds of the skipjack exports accruing to the Unit would be 85%
of the fob value in foreign exchange. After deduction of transport costs,



- 16 -
insurance, shrinkage, import duties in Japan, and taxes in Indonesia, the
net proceeds that would accrue to the Unit would be about US$155 per ton
(Annex 11).
Ex-Vessel Prices Aer Tembaga
5.04      The Unit would be able to pay about US$123 per ton (Rp 40 per kg)
to private operators for skipjack caught in Aer Tembaga waters and still
make a reasonable profit on its investment in freezing and storage facili-
ties (Annex 11). The 1969 ex-vessel price in Aer Tembaga for skipjack
fluctuated from Rp 80 per kg to Rp 20 per kg, depending on catches, while
the average price was about Rp 54 per kg.  The price of Rp 40 per kg, which
the Unit would pay, is lower than this average price, but well above prices
that occur when the catch is good. At Rp 40 per kg, private entrepeneurs
would obtain at least the same financial return presently made with older
boats. A price of Rp 40 per kg should thus clear the market of the addi-
tional production.
Operating Costs
5.05      High-speed diesel fuel is the main type presently available in
sufficient quantities for fishing operations in the Aer Tembaga area. How-
ever, technically and economically, marine diesel fuel could be used.  The
price of high-speed diesel is about Rp 12.50 per liter in the Aer Tembaga
area, while marine diesel fuel would cost about Rp 8 per liter. During
negotiations, the Government has indicated that it would use its best efforts
to make marine diesel fuel available at Aer Tembaga in sufficient supplies
for all fishing vessels based at Aer Tembaga.
5.06      Government economists expect that wages and salaries may increase
after 1970 at a net rate of 3% per annum, while the cost of fuel and other
supplies would remain stable. However, operating costs and export prices
have been assessed at the 1970 level for calculating operating results.
The financial returns, thus calculated, should be considered conservative
since revenues in real terms may increase by more than 3% per annum (Annex
8), while probably only the labor component of the operating costs would
increase in real terms at such a rate.
B. Financial Returns
5.07      The financial rate of return (after corporation taxes) on invest-
ment in a 30-G.T. fishing vessel would be about 20% at a price of US$275
per ton and 33% at a price of US$300 per ton. Annex 12 presents the de-
tails of the calculation.
5.08      Private entrepreneurs would benefit from any export price in-
crease because their operations would start only after the export market
has been establishe4. Furthermore, under the price formula detailed
above in paragraph 4.18, their ex-vessel prices would increase with the



- 17 -
export prices. On the other hand, if operating costs were to increase by
more than 20%, the financial return would become marginal at a constant
export price of US$275 per ton. Such a possibility exists if a general
inflation would push up costs, while Government would stabilize the ex-
change rate instead of letting it follow the cost increases and maintain
the level of export taxation. If, as is expected, export prices increase
by 3% per annum, marginal returns would only occur if inflation results in
cost increases of substantially more than 20%, in addition to the anticipated
increase of 3% per annum.
5.09      The financial rate of return on investment in fish carriers would
be about 15%. This return has been calculated on the basis of a charter
fee of about US$55 per ton, which is the prevailing rate. Details are pre-
sented in Annex 13. The return would be higher if the carriers obtain
freight for the trip back to Indonesia. On the other hand, charter rates
may be reduced substantially in the future because the Japanese tuna fish-
ing industry is reducing its fleet (Annex 8) and a substantial number of
carriers may become available for charter. A reevaluation of the charter
market should therefore take place before orders are placed for carriers.
If long-term charters can be obtained at rates substantially below the
present rate, it may be more advantageous to enter into a long-term con-
tract than to start own carrier operations (para 4.20).
5.10      The financial forecasts for the Unit combine operating results of
the Unit's fishing vessels (Annex 12), the carriers (Annex 13), and the
operating costs of freezing and storage facilities (Annex 14). The Unit
would incur losses during the first 3 years of the project disbursement
period, but thereafter would make about 15% return on its investments. The
estimated financial returns on the Unit's assets, computed on an annual
basis, are shown in Annex 15. Balance sheet forecasts are in Annex 16 and
sources and applications of funds forecasts in Annex 17.
C. Sub-borrowers' Financing Plans
5.11      The proceeds of the IDA credit earmarked for the Unit amount to
Rp 915 million (US$2.8 million).  The Government would supplement the IDA
funds with such amounts of its own funds as are needed to carry out the
project.  Additional Government funds needed have been estimated at Rp 141
million (us$o.4 million) and the Government has agreed to make these avail-
able in accordance with the arrangements set forth in paragraph 4.08.
5.12      The Government would make loans totaling US$0.7 million (Rp 225.9
million) to the private companies for the total costs of the fishing vessels
(para 4.09). Private companies would provide the necessary working capital
from their own resources. The consolidated requirements and sources of funds
forecast for the private companies are presented in Annex 18.

5.13      The following table summarizes (see Annex 18B for details) the
requirements and sources of funds for the Unit (Annex 17) and for the
private entrepreneurs (Annex 18A). The assumptions for the financial fore-
casts are presented in Annex 19.

5.14      The financial projections show that the Unit would be able to
generate sufficient funds after the 5-year grace period to cover debt serv-
ice payments. The dobt service coverage ratio over the 15-year loan period
is 1.12, which is loVbut acceptable for an operation of this kind.  The



- 19 -
projections have been made on the assumption that no major investments
would be undertaken by the Unit other than those under the project. Funds
from the Aer Tembaga operations would not be used for the operation of the
other units of the State Fisheries Corporation. The Government would pro-
vide to the Aer Tembaga Unit equity capital in the amount projected and
would also provide a medium-term loan in the amount projected. The pro-
ceeds of the equity and loan funds would be used exclusively by the Unit
for project purposes. Assurance to this effect has been obtained during
negotiations.
5.15      Proceeds from the operations of the privately owned fishing vessels
would be sufficient to cover debt service payments as of the start of opera-
tions of the vessels. The consolidated cash flow statement shows that debt
service coverage over the loan period would be 1.34.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
Economic Return
6.01      The principal task of the Unit would be to demonstrate that skip-
Jack fishing for export purposes would be a profitable operation and to
promote a skipjack export industry. For this purpose, the Unit would operate
the freezing and storage facilities, 15 fishing vessels, and 2 carriers.
Private entrepreneurs lack the capital and skills to operate the shore
facilities and carriers, but they would own and operate another 15 fishing
vessels under this project. When skipjack operations by private companies
hs.e been expanded, it is expected that the Unit would concentrate its efforts
on serving principally as an export agent.
6.02      The quantifiable benefits to the economy consist of export earn-
ings at an average annual level of about US$1.3 million. Annex 20 indicates
an economic rate of 25.6%, based on the skipjack export price of US$275.
The sensitivity of the economic retr-,n to changes in export prices and
operating costs within a reasonable range is shown below. It shows that
the return is likely to vary between 20% and 30%:
1970 Skipjack Wholesale Price in Japan
US$275 (per ton) US$300
Operating Costs Constant                        25.6%               29.8%
Operating Costs 20% higher                      20.0%               24.7%
The rates of return indicate that the project is economically justified.  In
this calculation, labor has been costed at projected market wage rates.



- 20 -
Disposition of Income and Taxation
6.03      The project would create employment for about 1,200 workers.  The
Unit, private companies, and Government would share in the benefits, as in-
dicated in Annex 20. Taxes accruing to the Government amount to nearly 40%
of total benefits generated over the project's lifetime, and average about
Rp 120 million (US$370,000) per annum. After the project period, the Unit
would be able to reinvest its profits in a further expansion of skipjack
operations; private companies would be able to reinvest their profits in
additional vessels.
Foreign Exchange Earnings
6.o4      The proposed project would result in net foreign exchange earn-
ings of at least US$1.3 million annually, while the investments in foreign
exchange would be about US$3.5 million. In order to test the project im-
pact on the balance of payments, the implicit foreign exchange rate of the
project was calculated. The ratio of discounted domestic currency costs
to discounted net foreign exchange earnings (gross earnings minus invest-
ment costs, minus operating costs, all in foreign exchange) represents the
number of domestic currency units needed to produce one unit of foreign
exchange. Following the assumptions leading to a 26% economic rate of
return and with a discount rate of 10%, the implicit foreign exchange rate
is Rp 103 = US$1 (at a 15% discount rate: Rp 99 = US$1). In other words,
only about Rp 100 is necessary to produce US$1, which compares favorably
with the new unified exchange rate of Rp 378 = US$1.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The proposed project would be the first phase of a long-term
fisheries development program, aimed at increased exports of skipjack.
The project is technically feasible, provided management of the Corpora-
tion would be strengthened. The financial rates of return to the operators
indicate that the project is financially attractive. The economic rates
of return are satisfactory.
7.02      Agreements were reached with the Government on the following
principal points during negotiations:
(i)  any undisbursed amount of the credit would be canceled.  The
IDA credit amount earmarked for private fishing vessels would
be provided to the Unit if the Government proves that, not-
withstanding its best efforts, private parties could not be
found. Disbursement would not take place for the carriers if
they are less economical than time charter (para 3.17);
(ii)  experts, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed as mentioned
in paragraph 4.03;



- 21 -
(iii)  a project committee would be established to review the
progress of the project, with composition and functions
satisfactory to IDA (para 4.07);
(iv)  selection of private sub-borrowers would be approved by
IDA (para 4.11) and subsidiary loan agreements with private
sub-borrowers would be satisfactory to IDA (para 4.12);
(v)  the price paid for skipjack by the Unit to private entre-
preneurs would be set and reviewed periodically as outlined
in paragraph 4.18; a sales agent would be appointed abroad
and payments would be based on published skipjack prices
(para 4.21);
(vi)  prior to calling for tender for the refrigerated carriers,
a review of the economics of charter versus carrier opera-
tions would be made by the Directorate General and submitted
to IDA (para 5.09); and
(vii)  no major investments would be undertaken by the Unit other
than those under the project; equity capital would be in-
creased by Rp 200 million and a medium-term loan of Rp 100
million would also be provided (paras 4.o8 and 5.14).
7.03      The execution of the subsidiary financing agreement with the
Unit, and the appointment and their entry on. duty of a chief of project
operations and an accountant would be conditions of effectiveness of the
proposed credit.
7.04      The project forms a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$3.5
;illion.

Fisheries Administration
The Directorate General of Fisheries
1.        Government responsibility for fisheries is vested in the Ministry
of Agriculture (the Directorate General of Fisheries). The structure of
the Government's fishery administration is shown in Annex 3, B and C. The
Office of the Directorate General has a wide range of activities. It covers
general administration, extension work, research, education and training,
and supervision of the State Fisheries Corporations. There is a fishery
officer in each of the 26 provinces whose main task is the collection of
statistics.
2.        The total number of people employed is about 1,700, of which 280
work in the Directorate General in Djakarta; some 400 are employed in
fisheries research and training, some 50 in extension work, and about 1,000
in the State Fisheries Corporations. About 250 have received scientific
(nrd technical training. However, there is a recognized shortage of per-
,:innel with experience in commercial and economic aspects of the fishing
industry.
Research and Training
1.        Four research institutions are dealing, respectively, with marine
resources research, fishing equipment technology, fish processing techno-
logy and inland fisheries research. The impact of the research on fisheries
development in Indonesia has thus far been negligible.
4.        There are nine fisheries training centers at various levels:
a fisheries academy, three senior fisheries high schools, three junior
fisheries schools, and two adult training centers. Skipper's certificates
for up to 30 miles off-shore can be obtained in the junior fisheries schools,
for up +o 60 miles in the senior schools, and for beyond 60 miles in the
fisheri ; academy. The annual number of graduates awarded certificates is
about 140, which is adequate for the present needs. Details are presented
in Annex 3D. There are facilities for technical personnel in all major
harbors in Indonesia, where licenses can be obtained for Motor Driver, Motor
Machine Driver and Third Engineer. There is no shortage of such personnel
in Indonesia (for details, see Annex 3E).



ANNEX 3A

5.        However, there are few skilled fishermen who can operate modern
fishing gear and vessels for trawling and purse seining - techniques that
account for two-thirds of the world's fish catch but that are rarely used
in Indonesia. The Government has requested UNDP technical assistance for
the introduction of these techniques through the fisheries schools.
State Fisheries Enterprises (Units)
6.        Six State Fisheries Units operate in the Western Region and three
in the Eastern Region. In 1969, these were centralized and reorganized
into a State Fisheries Corporation-Western Division and a State Fisheries
Corporation-Eastern Division. The principal activities of the Western Divi-
sion's Corporation are the operation of a cold storage facility in Djakarta
and five shipyards, two of which, in Tegal and Badjo, can undertake boat
building. In addition, some limited fishing operations are carried out by
about 20 boats, divided among three bases (Djakarta, Belawan and Tegal).
The Corporation in the Eastern Division carries out fishing operations in
Aer Tembaga, Ternate, and Ambon and a small carrier operation in Makassar.
The Units have kept their legal status and are legally and financially
autonomous.

ANNEX 4
INDONESIA
FISHERIES PROJECT
Fish Resources and Fisheries Development Policy
A. Fish Resources
1.        The area surrounded by Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and
Lower Sunda Islands (see Map) forms the inland sea of Indonesia, which,
in 1958, was declared to be under the exclusive territorial jyrisdic-
tion of Indonesia. This covers an area of about 5 million km . Estimates
of potential catches from these waters are as high as 5 million ton
annually.
2.        Present marine fishing operations are, however, confined mostly
to shallow, protected waters a short distance from the coast, which is the
only area accessible to small traditional fishing vessels. Even though
the Government's potential production estimates may be too optimistic,
annual marine fish production could probably be raised substantially above
the 1968 level of 726,000 ton.
3.        Excellent fishing grounds for skipjack, a small tuna species,
are found in the Celebes, Molucca, Ceram, and Banda Seas. Present produc-
tion is about 5,000 ton per annum; resources could sustain a yield of at
least 50,000 ton and possibly more than 100,000 ton annually.
4.        Fish culture produces about 120,000 ton and is carried out on
about 120,000 ha of irrigated rice fields. There are another 200,000 ha
of well-irrigated fields that could also be used and also about 6 million
ha of mangrove swamps that are currently unexploited. A number of tech-
nical problems, however, remain to be solved, such as the use of low-toxide
fertilizer in the rice fields, eradication of water hyacinth, better stock-
ing and shorter rearing, additional feeding in fish ponds and introduction
of mechanization.
5.        Also, the inland fresh fish capture, which at present produces
220,000 ton, can be substantially increased, provided that improved fish-
ing techniques are employed and a better marketing system is established.
A conservative estimate is that production could be tripled.
B. Fisheries Development Policy
6.        The fisheries target of the Government's Development Plan (1970-
1974) is to increase production from about 1.2 million ton per annum to
about 2.0 million ton. The Government's planned budget allocation for



ANNEX 4
Page 2
this period amounts to Rp 22 billion (US$67.5 million), which represents
about 14% of the total budget for agriculture. The planned production in-
crease, hovever, appears optimistic; funds allocated for the years 1970 and
1971 amount to only US$4.0 million.
7.        The plan is Yery general in outline and quite flexible.  Marine
fisheries development would be encouraged by the introduction of modern
fishing gear. To raise the production of inland fish cultivation, fish
hatcheries would be rehabilitated and the poisoning of fish in rice fields
and ponds would be fought. Swamp waters, in the first stage limited to
East Java, would also be exploited. Inland fish capture would be increased
by introducing better fishing techniques and improving market outlets. Ex-
isting fishery schools would be improved to include instruction in trawling
and purse seining. The program would depend mainly on research and surveys
to identify possible projects.
8.        To attract private domestic capital as well as foreign, the Govern-
ment has given substantial incentives, such as a 5-year tax exemption, relief
from payment of import duties on imported plant and equipment, and a guarantee
that the origin of domestic capital would not be investigated by the fiscal
authorities. These incentives have led to some investments by domestic
entrepreneurs in shrimp fishing and cold storage facilities for shrimp ex-
ports. Foreign private investment in fisheries has not yet taken place,
but a number of firms are interested in shrimp fishing because of the high
profit potential. Eight firms were recently granted a 12-month trial per-
mission. Thereafter, they will have to decide whether to invest in a
joint venture; otherwise, the permission expires.

Skipjack Fisheries Development
A. Present Skipjack Fishing Operations in the Sulawesi Area
1.        Skipjack operations are at present carried out by six private
entrepreneurs, who have a combined total of 27 vessels of the 5- to 15-
gross-ton (G.T.) class in the Celebes Sea, and by the State Fisheries Cor-
poration - Eastern Division, which has 23 vessels of the 15-G.T. class in
the Celebes Sea, the Molucca Sea, and the Banda Sea (see Map).
2.        The private fishing companies are all located at Aer Tembaga
and their operations are successful. Detailed data on the present (1969)
operating costs, revenues, and investment costs of a typical 15-G.T. pole
and line boat are presented in Annex 6. The financial rate of return of
such a boat is over 20%. Few such boats are used by the private companies,
who use mainly smaller boats. The return on a smaller boat is about 15%.
3.        The total skipjack production of the private fishing companies
and the State Fisheries Corporation is about 5,000 ton per annum. The
boats of the 15-G.T. class carry a crew of about 20 while smaller boats
carry a proportionately smaller number. Fishing operations are limited to
the coastal waters, as the boats can make only daily trips. When the skip-
Jack schools are intercepted, live bait is used to attract them and water
is showered, under pressure, on the sea to simulate the presence of abundant
prey. In a 15-G.T. boat, the fish are then caught by about 16 fishermen,
using poles and lines with blank hooks. The average daily catch of a 15-G.T.
boat is about 600 kg, the total number of fishing days is about 200, and
the total catch per annum about 120 ton. The present production satisfies
local demand. The catches are auctioned daily in marketplaces owned by
the respective municipalities, who charge an auction fee of 5% of the pro-
ceeds. Nearly the entire catch is retailed fresh; only about 5% is smoked,
which preserves the fish for 3 to 4 days.
B. Skipjack Fisheries Development
4.        Any expansion of present skipjack fishing operations should be
for export (frozen skipjack) because present production satisfies local
Sulawesi demand. World demand for skipjack is increasing, and prices are
likely to rise by at least 3% per annum. A detailed analysis of world
tuna production, consumption, and expected price trends is presented in
Annex 8.

5.        American and Japanese canneries would be the principal customers
for Indonesia's skipjack. The nearest American tuna transshipment harbor,
Palau (South Carolina Islands), cannot receive additional skipjack ship-
ments as the storage capacity is limited. Consequently, the nearest ex-
port markets would be American Samoa, where a canning factory operates,
and Japan. Ex-vessel prices paid in Japan are about the same as those
paid in Western America (California). Prices paid in Samoa are also prac-
tically equal to ex-vessel prices paid on the West Coast of America
because high transport costs to California are offset by the cheaper
labor costs in Samoa. However, transport costs from Indonesia to Samoa
(Sulawesi to Samoa, 3,300 miles) would be at least US$30 per ton higher
than transport costs to Japan (Sulawesi to Japan, 2,200 miles) because of
the longer distance and higher handling costs.  The most profitable outlet
for Indonesian skipjack at the present time is therefore Japan.
6.        Although skipjack resources are abundant in Eastern Indonesia,
any expansion of operations depends on the availability of live bait and
on the range of the vessels. At present, live bait is obtained from a
fleet of small boats fishing with lampara nets (lift nets with an attached
light). Bait fishing cannot be expanded under the present technique be-
cause the range of the boats is limited. Larger skipjack fishing vessels
(30 G.T. instead of a maximum of 15 G.T.) could carry their own live bait
fishing gear and would be able to exploit more distant bait resources. A
2-year study by a Japanese bait expert (FAO) has shown that substantial
resources are available around Aer Tembaga, but that the Ambon area would
not sustain an increased bait production. The Indonesian Government's
proposal to operate some 10 additional boats out of Ambon is, therefore,
not acceptable at this stage. Further investigations by the State Fisheries
Corporation are required before it can be determined whether expansion at
Ambon is justified. Therefore, the project area should be confined to the
area around Aer Tembaga.
7.        The other factor limiting expansion of the present fleet is
that the vessels make only 1-day trips because their bait and fish holds
are too small. Any further production expansion should be undertaken by
larger boats that can exploit more distant live bait and skipjack resources.
Boats of the 30-G.T. class would be very suitable for this purpose. These
vessels would be able to make weekly trips (about 40 trips a year within
a 90-mile range, 12 hours' run at 8.5 knots) off the bait supply grounds
on Bangka strait, Bitung and Ratatotok. All these fishing grounds fall
within the territorial jurisdiction of Indonesia.
8.        The most suitable fishing port for the expansion of skipjack
fisheries in Indonesia is Aer Tembaga, a natural fishing port, about 8 km
from Bitung, the port of Menado, which is the capital of North Sulawesi
province. The live bait situation is favorable and skipjack resources are
abundant. Furthermore, it is the only fishing port where a substantial
private fishing industry, in addition to the State Fisheries Corporation's
activities, is operating successfully. Expansion of fishing operations

Page 3
in this area would not be hampered by a shortage of experienced fishermen
and technical personnel. However, freezing and storage facilities would
need to be constructed for the export of the skipjack. The harbor and
its approach are excellent, and the harbor provides a natural shelter from
all winds. No major construction works are necessary.

The State Fisheries Corioration - Eastern Division
1.        The State Fisheries Units (Annex 3A) operate under the law
governing State enterprises (Law No. 19, 1960). As such, they have legal
and financial autonomy.
2.        The State Fisheries Corporation - Eastern Division was created
in 1969 to provide centralized supervision of the Aer Tembaga, Makassar,
Ternate, and Ambon Units. However, each unit still operates autono-
mously and centralized control has not yet been established. The Aer
Tembaga Unit operates 10 fishing vessels, the Ternate Unit operates 5,
and the Ambon Unit 8. The Aer Tembaga Unit also operates a boat repair
yard. The Makassar Unit operates two carriers to provide fishing supplies
to isolated fishing communities. The organization chart of the Corporation
is presented in Annex 7B.
3.        The overall operations of the Corporation show the limited
experience of its executives. Procurement, bait catching, sales arrange-
ments and accounting should be improved. The fishing operations, however,
have been carried out on a sound professional basis. Crews are eager to
work because they share in the catch.
4.        Operating results for the Ternate Unit are not available as the
accounts are not kept properly. Balance sheets and profit and loss state-
ments of the Aer Tembaga, Ambon and Makassar Units are presented for the
years 1967 and 1968 in Annexes 7C and D, but it should be mentioned that
these statements have not been audited. Moreover, the financial data have
been kept on an historic cost basis instead of on the basis of replacement
values.

i4.         Prices in the USA and Japan have become remarkably similar in tho
last few years, a trend that will pr )ably continue because of the increased
tracl      relations.  Prices for skipjack have been consistently quoted at
a discount compared to other varieties.  In 1969, the average skipjack price was
about $315 per m ton.
5.          The  U.S.   Bureau of Commercial Fisheries has made an analysis
of past world consumption  and has found that,with the exception of the U1SA,
tuna prices were not a significant force in affecting per capita constunption of'
tuna over the 1956-66 period, but that the demand for tuna is mainly determined
by the population increase, the increase in the standard of livin- (real per
capita income increases) and the income elasticity of demand.  Using projectionis
of population and per capita income for the next 20 years, together with
estimated income elasticities, which are for most of the countries about 1.. ,
the Bureau found that world tuna consumption would increase by about 5.L"S per
annum to 4.9 million tonis in 1990. Ilowever, income elasticity may drop whien
the living standard rises.  If income elasticity were to fall by 50,' over the
next 20 years, which is the most pessimistic view, total tuna demand should
still increase by about 3.8X, to nearly 3.3 million tons in 1990.  The increase
in total world consumption may thus be estimated at about 1.7 to 3.3 million
tons by the end of the next 20 years, as presented in the following table:

C.          The above projection has been made under the assumption that the
sulppl.y of tuna is perfectly elastic.  Nowever, analyses bar biologists indicate
that the potential increase in tuna production from world oceans may be only
1.25 million tons, as shown in the table below.  The total potential world
produietion would thus be about 2.7 million tons.

Practically the entire increase would have to come from the halvesting of
sklipjack from th,e Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.  Catches of othier tuna
species have reached their maximum sustainable yield.
7.          The supply of tuna would thus fall short of demand
withiin the next 20 years, which would increase prices and curtail demand.
The Bureau of Commercial Fisheries estimates that the average price for all tuna
woulOl increase from about ';1,0O per ton now to more that M5OO per ton by 1990,
an annual increase of about Ls, and that world consumption by 1990 would reach
a'bout 2.1 million tons. This estimate does not appear unreasonable, but it is an
estinmate of the average price of all tuna species, and it must be expected
that the increase in skipjacl- prices would show a different pattern than the



ANNEX 8
Page )
increase in the prices of the larger tuna species. The projection is moreover
made according to an exponential function that does not take into account that
prices may rise differently in different intervals during the 20-year projection
period.
8.          According to the tuna demand estimates discussed in paragraph 2,
world tuna demand would reach the potential world production in the 1980's, and
it would appear that prices would rise only slightly during the 1970's. With
respect to the larger tuna species, this may indeed be the case for the next 3
or 4 years. Production matches demand at present; however, the Japanese long-
lining tuna industry is reducing its fleet substantially because of high operating
costs (principally wages and bait production costs) and declining catch rates.
Prices may, therefore, remain at the present high level of US$400 per ton for the
next 3 or 4 years.  Dhcreased world demand and higher production costs for the
larger tuna species would tend to raise the prices thereafter. The price rise
would remain limited, however, during the next 10 years because skipjack could
be exploited increasingly (para 9). Prices of the larger tuna species may rise
by as much as 4% per annum in real terms. While the price elasticity in Japan
is probably inelastic because the demand for raw tuna is well established, the
price elasticity in the USA has been estimated at minus one. This very elastic
demand of the largest consumer would tend to decrease total world demand. The
price rise for the larger tuna species may therefore be less than 4%, but in all
probability can be expected to be at least 2% in real terms for the next 10 years.
9.        As indicated in paragraph 6, the additional supply of tuna beyond1 1970
must be principally derived from skipjack resources.  Total production of skip-
jack is at present only about 20% of total world tuna production.  It is a small
tuna species having an average  weight of only 3 kg.  Purse seine catch rates of
skipjack are less than those of other tuna species, such as Yellowfin. Experi-
mental fishing in Hawaii with gill nets over a 10-year period has shown negative
results, as the fish is very agile and seems to be able to avoid standing nets.
Expansion of pole and line fishing of skipjack is, however, possible and catch
rates with this method compare favorably with purse seine catches under present
technology.  The pole and line method is, however highly labor intensive.  Develop-
ing countries with relatively low labor costs should be in a good position to ob-
tain a share of the expected expansion.
10.       If the developing countries are able to build up a substantial skip-
jack export industry quickly, it may be expected that production costs during the
next 10 years would remain relatively stable. After this period, resources would
be more fully exploited, catch rates per unit effort would fall, and costs would
increase substantially.
11.       There has not been a great demand for skipjack in the past because
the meat is red and the fish is small compared to the larger varieties. Skip-
jack has, therefore, always sold at a price discount that averaged about US$80
per ton over the last 10 years. Skipjack is, however, becoming more and more
popular in view of the shortage of the larger tuna species. Canneries are now
able to bleach the meat or use it for such products as tuna in tomato sauce.



ANNEX 8
The demand for raw skipjack for consumption purposes has also increased in
Japan. Under the assumption that skipjack industries would be established
in developing countries, it may be expected that skipjack prices would
increase by only about 3% per annum during the next 10 years.
12.       It is possible,however, that the larger part of the expected
expansion would come from purse seining efforts by developed countries. If
no technological innovations, such as more suitable gear, take place,
production costs would rise substantially, and the price increase for skip-
jack diuring the next 10 years could be as much as 6% per annum in real terns.
13.       After 1980, whether the expansion takes place by pole and line
fishing or by purse seining, prices for skipjack and for the larger tuna species
would tend to increase even more rapidly, as the resources would be more and more
exploited. A reliable projection for this period is, however, on the basis of
available data and because of the uncertainty of technological development, not
possibLe.

Cost Estimates and Specifications - Shore Facilities
General Layout
1.        The general layout of the new shore facilities would improve the
present site. For loading and unloading, an extension of the existing jetty
is provided. The location of the cold storage and ice-making plant is
designed to be close to the jetty. For docking vessels, existing slipways
would be used but they would have to be improved. The existing well would
be used to supply fresh water, but the water supply pipelines need improve-
ment. Government consultants suggested a fuel-oil storage tank that would
have to be refilled by trucks. As this seems to be rather costly, a floating
tank that would be towed to Bitung harbor for refilling is recommended.

Water Supply
6.        The source of fresh water is the well located at the site.  The
volume is at least 250 m'/day. Water quality has been tested and found to
be suitable for industrial ure and drinking water. Water is pumped to the
reservoir located on the hill with the level mark of 12 m. The present
reservoir is to be enlarged to approximately 100 m3 capacity. From here,
water is distributed to the various outlets by gravity. The demand for water
is estimated to be as follows:
Ice-Making            45 m3/day
Cold Storage          35 m3/day
Ships                 25 m /day
Office Shops          10 m3/day
Housing, etc.         75   /day
190 m /day



ANNEX 10 A
Page   4
A separate reservoir is provided to supply staff housing units, which are
located at a higher level. Pipelines would be replaced where necessary.
Sewage System
7.        A sewage system is provided for both waste water and rain witer.
Sewers are the open type, except in the area of the cold storage where-a
closed type is used. The outlets are designed to be as far as possible frm
the fish processing area.
Power Supply and Distribution
8.        All the power required for industrial, as well as domestic use,
will be supplied by the diesel power plant. B.C. wire is used to distribute
power for domestic use, while ground cable will be used for industrial
purposes. For the power supply, six sets of generators of 180 kva each would be
installed. The diesel generator would be 380/220 v; 50-cycle and 3-phase.
A device for paralleled operation would also be provided. The diesel engines
would run on high-, as well as medium-speed diesel fuel.
Buildings
9.        The following buildings would be erected as part of the project:
(a) ice-making plant, freezing and cold storage   2,455 m2
(b) power house                                      216  2
(c) winch house                                      100 m
(d) mechanical workshop                              515 m2
(e) woodworking shop                                 160 m
(f) spare parts and equipment store                  230 m2
(g) fishing gear store                               750 m2
(h) pump house                                        18 m2
(i) staff houses (expatriates)                       480 m2
10.       Principal columns have cast-in-place reinforced concrete spot
footings; walls have rubble concrete continuous footings. Walls are red
brick framed by reinforced concrete columns and beams and finished with
plaster of cement mortar and whitewashing.  Floors are of cast-in-place con-
crete slabs. Roof trusses are of steel and roof covering is asbestos cement
sheet.  The ceiling is omitted in the engine room and the ice-making plant.
All the buildings are designed for a natural lighting and ventilation.
Adequate windows are, therefore, provided.
Ice-making Plant, Freezing and Cold Storage Rooms
11.       For the flexibility of the operation, the ice-making, freezing and
cold storage roams would be divided into small individual compartments, as
follows:

12.       The roof coverings are corrugated asbestos cement sheets.  The walls
are the usual red brick framed by reinforced concrete.  The wooden watertight
ceiling is strong enough to support the insulation material. Finishing of
floor and walls will be carried out after the insulation has been laid. The
clean height of the freezing and storage rooms is 3.5 m. The ceiling is
omitted in the ice-making room. The special cold storage doors are not included
in the design; such doors would be ordered, together with the refrigerating
equipment and insulation material. The arrangement of the rooms is subject
to alteration and must be adjusted to the adopted cold storage equipment.
Jetty for Loading and Urloading
1 .     'the proposed extensiorl of the jetty is 50 m long and 6 m wide.
[I'or the design o.U thejetty, a live load of 1 ton/rm2 will be assumed.
Hlorizontal Corces, due to the impact of berthing will be considered.
The depth alongside the jetty and its approach channel will enable the
berthlig ot the fishing vessels and carriers alongside at any stage of
the tide.  The construction proposed is a slab resting on reinforced
concrete piles. However, the type of construction will be decided
after completion of the soil investigation to be carried out as part of
the detailed engineering of the project. Funds required for the soil
investigation are pro7ided f'or in the cost of the jetty. Vertical
fenders made of locally available suitable hardwood will be provided.
The services on the jetty will include fuel oil, fresh water and elec-
tricity.

Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
State _iisheries Cor  oration - Easta-n DivLisDn - Aer Tembaga Unit
1.          Catch rates are shown in Annex 5 for the 15 G.T. boats and in
Annex 12 for the 30-G.T. boats. The boats will be operational as follows
(cunulative):
1972   1973   1974
Fishing vessels operated by Aer Tembaga Unit   4      10      15     15
l"ishing vessels operated by private
entrepreneurs                                   -       -      5     15
Carriers operated by Aer Tembaga Unit           -       -      1      2
2.        The price of fish sold to Japan is assumed at $275 per ton (Rp 89,650),
of which $55 per ton (lip 17,930) is supposed to cover the carrier operations and
$155 per ton (Rp 50,530) the fishing operations       (Annex 11).  The price of
fish sold on the local market is assumed at Rupiah 50 per kg. Production of the
15 G.T. fishing vessels would continue to be sold on the local market. Ice
sold on the local market would fetch a price of Pp 40000 per ton.
3.          The Aer Tembaga Unit would buy skipjack from the private entre-
preneurs at a price of Rp 40 per kg      (Annex 11).  Private entrepreneurs would
make at this price a financial return of about 20% on their investments. The
Aer Tembaga Unit would make a financial return of about 15% on the investments
in cold storage and freezing equipment. The entire production of the 30 G.T.
boats owned by the private entrepreneurs would be bought by t.he Aer Tembaga Unit.
h.          Operating costs of the fishing vessels are as presented in Annex 5
for the 15 G.T. boats and Annex 12 for the 30 G.T. boats.
5.          Operating costs for the freezing, storage plant, the ice plant and the
carriers are as presented below:
1972    1973    197h    1975
Carriers                                                - _ 48-j22  97i,7

Details of the operating costs at full capacity are presented in Annexes 13 and 14.
6.          Revenues of the shipyard would be Rp 480,000 per boat for the repair
of the 10 existing boats and l1p 1,369,200 per boat for the repair of the 15 new
fishing vessels (Annexes  6 and 12).  A detailed calculation has shown that the
shipyards operating costs (including spare parts) are Rp 280,000 per boat for
the 15 G.T. boats and Rp 1,095,360 for the 30 G.T. boats. Administrative
overheads are included in these costs.

7.          Depreciation would be maintained at a straight line rate of h%
for new buildings. New fishing vessels would be depreciated on a straight
line basis over 10 years, new plant and equipment and the carriers over a 15
year period. The depreciation schedule is as follows:

9.      It was assumed in the calculation of accounts receivable that local fish
sales would be paid in cash.  Export revenues would be cashed within a month
after shipment. There would be three 920-ton shipments in 1972, six 533-toin
shipments in 1973, eleven shipments of 580 ton in 197h, and twenty-two shipments
of 436 tons in 1975 and onwards. Accounts receivable of the shipyard would
increase from Rp 7 million in 1970 to Rp 114 million in 1975 when the fishing
vessels of the private entrepreneurs become operational.
10.         Inventories of fish average 210 tons in 1972, 266 tons in 1973, 290
tons in 1974 and 218 tons in 1975 and onwards. Ice storage would amount to about
200 tons. Inventories of spare parts for the shipyard are assumed to amount to
1 yearh supply; the cost of the spare parts is about 60% of the repair costs
of the boats. Spares for the maintenance of freezing, storage equipment and
workshop equipment would amount to about Rp 10,000,000, which also represents
about a yeais supply. We assumed that accounts payable would be paid within 2
weeks.

11.        The Government would increase equity capital of the Aer TembaaA
Unit by Rp 200 million.  In addition the Govrernment would make available
to the Aer Tembaga Unit a short term loan of about Rp 100 million at an
interest of' 12%. This loan would oe repaid within a h-year period.
Private Companies
12.        Private entrepreneurs would obtain a loan for the purchase cost of
the eishing vessels.  'They would have to provide funds for working capital from
their own resources.  rhe project loan would be for a 10-year period, without a
grace period.  The project loan to the private entrepreneurs amounts to
:ip 27,2,91i6,ooo (Us;j3 693,00).).
13.         Net profits and debt service repayments for a 30-G.T. boat, obtained
by a private entrepreneur, are as follows:

Economic Rate of Return
1.        The with and without approach has been followed for the calculation
of the economic rate of return.  The Aer Tembaga Unit's investment cait  (in-
cluding working capital) is shown in Annex 17 the private entrepreneurs' in
Annex 18.
2.        The quantifiable benefits to the economy consist of revenues
accruing to the operators and taxes (corporation, fuel and export taxes)
accruing to the Government. Revenues are based on the skipjack export
price of US$275 per ton (Annex 11). The Aer Tembaga Unit's returns and its
corporation taxes are shown in Annex 15; the private entrepreneurs' returns
and their corporation taxes are indicated in Annex 12B. Fuel taxes are 38%
of the fuel price. Export taxes are 15% of the fob value.
3.        The following table shows the total net benefit stream over the
l5-year lifetime of the project. The economic rate of return computed
following the discounted cash-flow method is 25.6%.
