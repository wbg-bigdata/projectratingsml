IThMERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCLATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOP-
MENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
FISHERIES PROJECT
1.         I submit the followiing report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Indonesia in an amount in various
currencies equivalent to $3.5 million for a fisheries project.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.         The Government of Indonesia has asked for a Development Credit to
help finance the expansion of the fishing industry in North Sulawesi (Celebes).
The project was appraised in November 1969.
3.         Negotiations for the proposed credit took place from April 27 to
May 4, 1970. The Borrower was represented by: Mr. Nizam Zachman, Director
General of Fisheries, Department of Agriculture; Mr. Saleh Afiff, Head of
the Bureau of Agriculture, National Planning Agency (Bappenas); Dr. Sidharto,
Chief, Planning Division, Directorate General of Fisheries; Mr. Rasidi,
Director of State Investments, Department of Finance; and Mr. Adian Silalahi,
Economic Attache, Embassy of Indonesia.
4.         If approved, this would be the fifth credit in the agricultural
sector and, together with the telecommunications credit to be considered by
the Executive Directors on the same date, would bring the total number of
credits to Indonesia to ten.  The following is a summary statement of IDA
credits to Indonesia to date, with disbursements as of May 31, 1970:

5.       The status of disbursements of the various Credits has been
described in my report and recommendation on the PUSRI Fertilizer Project,
dated April 30, 1970. Since that date disbursements under Credit No. 155
have begun, and Credit No. 165-IND became effective on June 1; the position
otherwise remains unchanged.
6.       During the next few months I expect to present to the Executive
Directors proposed credits for a technical education project and a third
irrigation rehabilitation project.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED CREDIT
7.       Borrower:            Republic of Indonesia
Beneficiaries:       The State Fisheries Enterprises North-Central
Sulawesi and private fishing enterprises
Amount:              Various currencies equivalent to $3.5 million.
Purpose:             The expansion of the fishing industry in
North Sulawesi by the construction, out-
fitting and operation of fishing vessels,
refrigerated carriers and supporting shore
facilities and related technical assistance.
Amortization:        In 50 years with a 10-year period of grace
through semi-annual installments commencing
November 1, 1980 and ending May 1, 2020.
Each installment up to and including payment
due May 1, 1990 to be 1/2 of 1 percent, and
each installment thereafter to be 1-1/2
percent.
Service Charge:      3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
Relending Terms:     The Government would provide to the State
Fisheries Enterprise North-Central Sulawesi,
$529,0o0 of the proceeds of the IDA Credit
in the form of equity investment in the
Enterprise, and $2,278,000 in the form of a
loan at 12 percent interest to be paid over
a 15-year period, including a 5-year grace
period. The Government would relend the
remaining $693,000 of the proceeds of the
Credit to private fishing enterprises at
the Government's standard lending rate to
the productive sector at the time the loans
are made (that rate is now 12 percent), to
be repaid in 10 years without a grace period.
Estimated Economic
Rate of Return:      About 26 percent per annum.

PART TTI - THE PROJECT
8.        A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report entitled "Fisheries Project Indonesia" (PA-50a) dated
June 22, 1970.
9.       IWithin the overall strategy of agricultural development in
Indonesia, fisheries play an important role and the expansion of fisheries
has been assigned high priority. Although the Indonesian archipelago en-
compasses seas of about 5 million square kilometers, marine fishing is
confined mostly to shallow coastal waters because of the small size of
traditional fishing vessels. The annual marine fish catch could be raised
substantially above the 1968 level of 726,000 tons by the introduction of
modern technology, equipment and other necessary facilities.
10.       The proposed project is the first phase of a program aimed at
expanding fishing for skipjack, a species of small tuna which is abundant
in the eastern seas of the Indonesian archipelago. The project consists
of the construction, equipment and operation of freezing and cold storage
facilities at Aer Tembaga, a natural fishing port in North Sulawesi; the
procurement and opera+ion of 30 pole and line wooden fishing vessels of
30 gross tons each; and the acquisition and operation of vessels to export
skipjack to overseas markets, most likely Japan (alternatively, if an
evaluation of the economics of time charter versus carrier operations
proves that this is more economical, the charter of such vessels).
11.       The State Fisheries Enterprise North-Central Sulawesi would
manage 15 of the fishing vessels, the shore facilities wlhich would in-
clude ice-making and freezing plants and cold storage facilities, the
two fish carriers (if procured) and the marketing overseas of the frozen
skipjack. Private fishing enterprises at Aer Tembaga would be provided
credit facilities by the Government through state commercial banks to
acquire the remaining 15 fishing vessels.
12.       The State Fisheries Enterprise is a public corporation, erijoying
legal and financial autonomy. The fishing operations of the Enterprise
are reasonably well carried out, though its overall performance reflects
the limited experience of its executives, particularly in procurement pro-
cedures, marketing and accounting. Technical assistance would be provided
under the proposed credit to strengthen the management of the Enterprise
by recruiting a chief of project operations, a master fisherman, a chief
of shore facilities and an accountant. A project committee would be set
up, consisting of representatives of various governmental organizations,
to review the progress of the project.
13.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $4.3 million, of
which $3.5 million, or about 80 percent, would be required in foreign ex-
change, assuming the fishing vessels are purchased abroad. The proposed
Credit would cover the entire foreign exchange cost. Procurement would be



on the basis of international competitive bidding; it is possible that
due to low construction costs for hulls, local shipyards would be the suc-
cessful bidders for the fishing vessels, even iithout any preference being
given to domestic suppliers in the comparison of bids. In this event, the
foreign exchange expenditure, which would be met by the Credit, would be
$3.0 million or 70 percent of the project cost, and the $0.5 million balance
of the Credit would be cancelled. The local costs of the project would be
met by the Government and the Enterprise.
14.       Assuming all fishing vessels are procured abroad, an amount of
$2.8 million out of the proceeds of the Credit would be used to meet tlhe
foreign exchange cost of investment by the Enterprise; the balance of the
Credit, $0.7 million, would be used directly by the Government to meet the
foreign exchange costs of the 15 fishing vessels to be acquired by private
fishing enterprises. Of the Credit proceeds earmarked for the Enterprise,
$529,000 would be provided as equity and the balance would be provided in
the form of a loan at 12% interest, to be repaid in 15 years including a
5-year grace period. The Government would supplement this loan to the En-
terprise with an additional Rp 141 million from its own resources, provided
on the same terms, bringing the total loan to Rp 856 million. In addition,
the Government would provide to the Enterprise a short-term loan (4 years
at 12% interest) amounting to Rp 100 million.  These loans would be repayable
to the Government in rupiahs and would provide for maintenance of value in
terms of US dollars.
15.       The funds to be provided to the private fishing enterprises would
be made available as loans at the Government's standard lending rate to the
productive sector at the time the loans are made (now 12%), to be repaid in
10 years with no grace period.
16.       The principal aim of the project would be to encourage the private
fisheries sector by showing that skipjack fishing for export is profitable,
A major barrier to expansion of the fishing industry in the Sulawesi area
has been the lack of shore facilities to deep-freeze, store and export fish
as local demand is satisfied. The Enterprise would now provide such facili-
ties. The project would be phased to allow the State Fisheries Enterprise
to initiate fishing operations and to demonstrate the viability of the pro-
ject in order to stimulate private sector interest. The proceeds of the
Credit allocated for the 15 vessels earmarked for private fishing enterprises
would be disbursed only for that purpose, unless the Government demonstrates
to the satisfaction of the Association that, despite its best efforts, the
vessels could not be sold to such enterprises. In that event, the vessels
wiould be acquired by the State Fisheries Enterprise, and the amount of the
Credit to be relent to the Enterprise would be increased correspondingly.
17.       The estimated economic rate of return would be 26 percent on a
skipjack export price of $275 per ton, indicating that the project is eco-
nomically justified. After the first three years, the Enterprise should have
a 15 percent financial return on its investments. An exchange reform was
introduced in Indonesia in April 1970 which involved the merging of the two



exchange markets - the BE (Bonus Export) and the DP (Complementary Foreign
Exchange) markets - at Rp 378 per US dollar, as compared with the former BE,
rate of Rp 326 per US dollar applicable to this project. The reform is not
expected to change appreciably the estimated economic and financial returns
on the project. The project would create additional employment for about
1,200 workers and result in net foreign exchange earnings of at least $1.3
million annually.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The Draft Development Credit Agreement between the Association
and the Republic of Indonesia, the recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Associa-
tion, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
19.       Aside from the usual provisions, the Draft Development Credit
Agreement contains special covenants in Section 4.03(b) to improve the mana-
gement of the Enterprise, in Section 4.04(b) to enable the private fishing
enterprises to operate in an efficient and profitable manner, and in Section
4.11 to regulate the purchase price of skipjack. The execution of the sub-
sidiary financing agreement, under which the Government would make available
to the Enterprise the required funds, and the appointment of a chief of
project operations and an accountant, have been made conditions of effective-
ness of the proposed Credit.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       The last full report on the economic position and prospects of
Indonesia (EAP-lOa) was issued on November 14, 1969 and a special report,
"Current Investment Activity in Indonesia" (EAP-14a) was issued on March
27, 1970. A basic data sheet is annexed. The most recent assessment of
the present economic situation is given in my Report and Recommendation
on the Telecommunications Expansion Project (P-846) dated June 24, 1970.
PART VI - COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECOIIMIENDATION
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
