REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND
FOR A FISHING HARBORS REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Iceland for the equivalent of US$7.0 million to help fi-
nance a fishing harbors rehabilitation project. The loan would have a term
of 15 years, including 4 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per
annum.
2.        On January 23, 1973 a volcano erupted on the outskirts of Iceland's
principal fishing port of Vestmannaeyjar in the Vestmann Islands. The
Vestmannaeyjar fishing fleet, the largest in Iceland handling about 20 per-
cent of the nation's catch, was not damaged and, indeed, played a major role
in successfully evacuating the island's inhabitants. However, considerable
damage was done to the town and to the processing plants on the island. As
the Icelandic economy is heavily dependent on fishing and fish processing,
the Government approached the Bank in February for emergency assistance to
the fishing industry. The proposed project is the Bank's response and is
designed to provide some of the new harbor facilities required as a result
of this emergency.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
3.        The last economic report on Iceland entitled "Current Economic Posi-
tion and Prospects of Iceland" (R69-216) was distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors on November 12, 1969. Since then two missions have visited Iceland
briefly, in August 1971 and April 1973, to bring up-to-date our information
on the economy. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
4.        Fishing and fish processing have traditionally been predominant in
the Icelandic economy, accounting for 14 percent of GNP and employment, and
80 percent of exports. Other industries, such as construction and services,
depend on fishing as a primary industry and as the principal source of for-
eign exchange earnings. The agricultural sector's contribution to GNP is
only about 5 percent and it employs some 12 percent of the labor force. Only
20 percent of the land is suitable for agriculture, and mainly only for live-
stock. Apart from its fishing grounds and grasslands, Iceland's only signif-
icant natural resources are its hydropower potential and geothermal energy
sources. There are no known mineral deposits of commercial significance,
except diatomite which is used commercially as a filtration agent.
5.        Strategically located in the middle of the rich fishing banks off
the sandy, harborless south coast of Iceland, Vestmannaeyjar was Iceland's
most important fishing port and, with its secure habor, was also a vital
shelter and an important service center for fishing boats from other ports.
The capacity of the fishmeal and oil factories in Vestmannaeyjar made it an



-2-
important center for the expanding capelin 1/ fishing, for which export prices
have been rising encouraging:Ly in 1973. Vestmannaeyjar contributed around 3
percent of the GNP of Iceland in 1972, when 52 percent of its working popula-
tion was directly engaged in fisheries and fish processing.
6.        The volcanic eruption led to the evacuation of the entire popula-
tion of 5,200 and the island's fleet of about 80 fishing vessels. Volcanic
activity stopped at the end of June. It is estimated that the damage thus
far sustained will lead to a two percent loss in Iceland's GNP in 1973, com-
pared with 1972, and a five percent loss in export earnings. Fish products
constitute 80 percent of the country's merchandise exports. Before the erup-
tion, it was estimated that Vestmannaeyjar would have exported fish products
equivalent to US$20 million in 1973. The losses would have been higher but
for an unusually large capelin catch. It has been estimated that, but for
the volcano, the island's factor income in 1973 would have been about 1,650
million Kronur (US$18.5 million). Of this amount, about 1,150 million Kronur
(US$13 million) represented wages and salaries, most of which have probably
been recovered through alternative employment on the mainland. The remain-
ing 500 million Kronur (US$5.5 million), consisting of property and entre-
preneurial income, was partially lost through cessation of all production
on Vestmannaeyjar during the important January-May fishing season.
7.        The replacement value of property destroyed is at least US$100 mil-
lion, equivalent to 13 percent of the forecast GNP for 1973. About 400 of
1,340 dwellings on the island have been destroyed. Four of the seven fish
processing plants were destroyed or heavily damaged, and the equipment of
the remainder evacuated to the mainland. About one-third of the streets and
adjacent municipal infrastructure were destroyed. The diversion of resources
into relocation and salvage of property, and the use of resources for recon-
struction, will have a major impact on capital formation and, therefore, on
the future growth of the small, full employment economy of Iceland. The
eruption on Vestmannaeyjar has thus hit the mainstream of economic life and
will have far-reaching consequences for the nation as a whole. It is esti-
mated that, barring further volcanic eruption, about one-half to two-thirds
of the population might return to the island within twqo to five years.
8.        In response to the Vestmannaeyjar disaster, the Althing (the Ice-
landic Parliament) passed legislation in February setting up an Emergency
Fund and imposing special taxes. The main purposes of the Fund are to cover
the costs of rescue and safeguarding operations, and to build up reserves for
eventual reconstruction work. It is also expected to be used to compensate
those suffering loss of income and property as a result of the eruption.
The new taxes are expected to provide the Fund with 1,700 million Kronur
(US$19 million, about two percent of this year's estimated GNP) per year.
The Fund will also receive grants from the Treasury and the Unemployment
1/   A small pelagic fish that comes to Iceland's south coast in spawning
migrations in late winter.



-3-
Insurance Fund to bring the total up to 2,000 million Kronur (US$23 million).
In addition, the Governments of Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland have agreed
to make grants totalling 1,550 million Kronur (US$18 million) to the Emergency
Fund. Money received from other governments, private organizations and indi-
viduals will also be paid into the Fund. According to the latest forecast,
the Fund is expected to receive 4,100 million Kronur (US$46 million) in 1973
and 1974: this forecast indicates that, in 1973, revenue will largely match
expenditure of 3,000 million Kronur (US$34 million) mainly for housing, rehabil-
itation operations in Vestmannaeyjar and compensation payments, but will leave
no room for the additional expenditure that will be needed once emergency
needs have been met. The forecast for 1974, which must still be regarded
as uncertain, shows that the expenditure for these emergency needs would
amount to 1,400 million Kronur (US$15 million) and exceed the revenue by
300 million Kronur (US$3 million). The special taxes imposed for the Fund
will be effective until February 1974, when they will be reviewed by the
Althing.
9.        The full long run cost of recovery from the disaster cannot yet be
fully calculated, but it is clear that resources of the Emergency Fund will
be inadequate. Substantial additional, but as yet unmeasured, burdens can
therefore be expected to fall upon the Icelandic economy over the next fewi
years.
Recent Economic Developments
10.       Instability in the fishing sector has dominiated recent developments
in the economy.  Following a catastrophic decline in the fish catch, real in-
comes declined in 1967-68 by nearly 20 percent. An economic upswing followed
the increase in the value of the fish catch in 1969, and was transformed into
a domestic boom in 1971-72, with consumption and investment increasing rapidly
and the balance of payments deteriorating as a result of a rapid increase in
imports. The increase in real GNP was about 6 percent in 1970, over 9 percent
in 1971 and 6 percent in 1972. Unemployment declined from about 2.5 percent
of the labor force in 1969 to 0.5 percent in 1972.
11.       The value of merchandise exports increased over 20 percent per annum
during 1969-72, mainly because of the increase in fish prices. The quantity
of fish caught, however, has not substantially increased since 1970, because
of the continuing low herring catch and a decline in the catch of white fish,
which have not been fully compensated by the increasing catch of capelin.
There has also been a rapid expansion of merchandise imports (averaging 23
percent per year during 1969-72) with the acceleration of economic activity,
to some extent related to large expenditures on ships and aircraft and imports
for the aluminum factory and power projects. There was a large current ac-
count deficit of about $44 million in 1971, falling to $20 million in 1972.
However, inflows of direct investment and loan capital exceeded this deficit,
and foreign exchange reserves increased. The realignment of major currencies
since Mlarch 1973, together with a favorable price trend for Iceland's export
products, necessitated a revaluation of the Krona by six percent in April 1973
to avoid further serious inflation. Abolition of fixed margins between the
official buying and selling rates and the par value in June resulted in a
further revaluation of around four percent.



- 4-
12.       The cost of living index rose at ar average annual rate of 10 per-
cent during 1969-72. Wages are linked to increases in the cost of living.
The Government tried to influence the wage settlements of December 1971 through
the elimination of a sales tax on necessities, increased consumer subsidies
and a reduction of the working week, However, hourly nominal wage rates in-
creased by nearly 19 percent in 1971 and 27 percent in 1972.    In July 1972,
the Government imposed a price freeze and increased subsidies to reduce the
necessity for price increases.
13.       ianufacturing lndustry (exclud-ing fish processing) contributes about
16 percent of GNP. It consists largely of small scale industries producing
mainly for the local market, although there hias recently been some increase
in exports from the woollen and knitting industries.    Major new export indus-
tries are diatomite and aluminum.   Exports of aluminut dropped from 33,500
tons in 1970 to 17,600 tons in 1971 but increased to 59,000 tons in 1972,
although export prices were then 13.5 percent lower, The net impact of the
aluminum industry on the balance of paymernts is small, because of the large
import content in production.
14.       The industrial trade agreement signed with tae European Economic
Community (EEC) in July 1972, which applies to all. industrial products and
to most categories of fish products, provides thlat EEC tariffs will be abo-
lished i'n five equal installments from April 1972 through July 1977, except
for alumiinum on which the tariff will be abolished in 1980.   Iceland's pro-
tective tariffs on industrial imports from EEC' countries will be eliminated
by 1980. EEC has reserved the right not to apply. the tariff reductions for
fish products until the fishing dispute between Iceland and the U.K. and
Germany has been resolved. The gradual reduction of tariffs on industrial
imports will necessitate substantial readjuistment in thiose manufacturing
industries in Iceland that hiave benefitted from protection in the domestic
market.
External Debt
15.       Iceland's total long and medium ter-mi external debt was about US$196
million at the end of 1972, of which US$22 million was owed to the Bank; total
debt service in 1972 was about US$35 million, of which US$2.4 million was to
the Bank. The debt service ratio increased from around 8 percent during 1963-
66 to over 16 percent in 1969 as a result of the fall iP fishI catches and
prices, but fell to 11 percent in 1972 with the recovery of export earnings.
Since the prospects for exports of fish products are favorable, and given the
industriousness of the Icelandic people backed by prudent monetary policies,
Iceland can be considered creditworthy for further Bank lending.
PART IS - BANK GROU-P OPERATIOlNS IN ICELAND
16.       The Bank has made eight loans totalling US$30.0 million to, or guar-
anteed by, the Republic of Ieeland. Work under all projects h,as been accom-
plished satisfactorily, and disbuirsemenits under Loan 707-IC made in 1970 for



Highways (the only on-going project) will be completed by the end of October
1973. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as at August 31,
1973. There have been no IFC investments in Iceland so far and none are
under consideration.
17.       The proposed loan, the first directly for the fishing sector, would
be one of two in the current year's lending program. The second would be for
the Sigalda Power project, the logical next choice among the country's poten-
tial hydropower sites following the completion of the Burfell project (Loan
466-IC). In addition to meeting normal market growth, including the growth
of electric space-heating, the project would make power available for new
and expanding power-intensive industries. It would thus be in line with the
Bank's objective of helping Iceland to diversify its economy and exports, and
reduce its dependence upon fisheries.
18.       Iceland, with some assistance from the Bank, has been able to make
increasing use of international capital markets to meet its need for long-
term external capital. It is expected that much of the financing for Sigalda
will be obtained in these markets, and that Iceland will in the future be
able to obtain the external capital it requires for development projects on
world markets. Hence, no further Bank lending after FY74 is presently en-
visaged.
PART III - FISHERIES SECTOR
19.       Iceland is situated at the confluence of cold and warm currents con-
taining many species of fish. During late winter and early spring the main
fish stocks gather for spawning in the warm water area off the south and west
coasts, making it one of the richest fishing grounds in the North Atlantic.
Cod, for centuries the most important species to the economy, accounts for
70 percent of the value of the nation's annual catch, together with related
species. About 75 percent of Icelandic cod is landed in the January-May sea-
son. Unlike cod, the herring industry has undergone large fluctuations in
output. In the mid 1960's, the Icelandic herring catch amounted to over
750,000 tons annually, or more than 50 percent of the quantity of fish landed.
The catch has since fallen by over 90 percent, in spite of an international
agreement on herring conservation. Following the depletion of the herring
stocks, the cheaper and more transitory species of capelin gained ground.
The fishing of capelin started in 1965, but landings rose to 437,000 tons
in 1973. Thus far, only Icelandic vessels have exploited capelin, which is
converted into fishmeal mainly for export. Many other fish are landed in
substantial quantities, including coalfish, redfish and catfish. Catches of
shrimp and lobster have grown in recent years.
20.       Because fishing is so important to the economy, the Government plays
an active part in regulating the industry, which is based largely on private
enterprise. Exports of fish products are handled exclusively by two government-
approved bodies. The Government pays particular attention to resource manage-
ment, quality control, research and efficiency.



- 6 -
21.       The Government provides financial support in a variety of ways.    A
Fish Price Equalization Fund, a statutory body, acts as a stabilizing influence
on sectoral prices. Most financial aid for the industry is provided through
investment loans guaranteed by the Treasury or granted by the Fisheries Loan
Fund, another statutory body. The Economic Development Institute prepares
aggregate financial data for the fishing fleet and processing plants. Since
fishermen receive a share of the value of their boat's catch, their personal
incomes vary considerably. However, the Government has established a scheme
to ensure a minimum income level.   The shortage of crews suggests tnat tne
prevailing financial rewards generally provide less than adequate incentives
for working as a fisherman.
22.       As the bulk of fish catches are seasonal and in varying locations,
most Icelandic ports do not have sufficient processing capacity to handle all
their landings. Freezing plants are consequently located all over the country,
to give easy access from the various ports. An exception was Vestmannaeyjar
which, with its reasonably safe entrance and harbor, had sufficient capacity
to process all landings; this capacity was increasingly utilized year-round
because of the summer trawl for lobsters and other bottom-feeding species.
Vestmannaeyjar also handled landings from boats registered in other harbors.
PART IV - TIlE PROJECT
Project History
23.       The project was prepared by an FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program mission
which visited Iceland in March, 1973, following the Government's request to
the Bank for an emergency loan to help overcome some of the difficulties pre-
sented by the volcanic eruption in Vestmannaeyjar. An appraisal mission visited
Iceland in June, 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington in September, 1973,
at which the Icelandic delegation was headed by Mr. David Olafsson, Governor,
Central Bank of Iceland.
Project Description
24.       The entire Vestmannaeyjar fleet of 80 fishing vessels, which was
successfully evacuated from the island, is presently located in a number of
overcrowded and unsafe harbors on the Icelandic mainland. It is estimated
that, as Vestmannaeyjar is rehabilitated within the next two to five years,
about one-half to two-thirds of the population, and with it about one-half
of the fishing fleet, might return. However, until then, safe harborage
needs to be provided to the existing fleet of 80 in the overcrowded harbors,
and thereafter adequate harborage for the 40 or so vessels which are expected
to remain on the mainland permanently. The project would include three har-
bors on the south coast of the mainland found to be most suitable for both
these objectives:
(a) detailed engineering and construction of a new breakwater,
basin and quays at Thorlakshofn;



-7-
(b) construction of new quays, dredging the basin, rock blasting
and dredging the channel and entrance at Grindavik; and
(c) construction of a new quay at Hornafjordur.
The main features of the project are summarized in Annex III and described
in detail in the report entitled "Fishing Harbors Rehabilitation Project -
Iceland" (228a-IC) dated September 25, 1973, which is being distributed sep-
arately to the Executive Directors.
Project Costs and Financing
25.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and customs duties, and
excluding interest during construction, is estimated at US$11.3 million, equiv-
alent, with a foreign exchange cost of US$7 million which would be financed
under the proposed loan. In order to provide some essential improvements
prior to the next cod season (January-May, 1974), some engineering and civil
works at Grindavik were begun shortly after the eruption. The proposed loan
would therefore include up to US$1.3 million of retroactive financing to cover
the foreign exchange expenditures for these works contracted for since March,
1973. Local financing for the project would be made available by the Govern-
ment, following its normal practice, in the form of loans to the municipali-
ties which own the Grindavik and Hornafjordur harbors. In the case of
Thorlakshofn, a state-owned port, the entire local financing would be pro-
vided by the Government. Fees for the use of fishing harbors are uniform
throughout Iceland and it is Government policy to keep them relatively low.
No change in this policy is contemplated in the context of this project,
since its purpose is to provide emergency assistance to Iceland in making
the specific port investments required to provide safe south coast harbors
for the vessels displaced by the Vestmannaeyjar disaster. The project thus
does not provide for the full financial recovery of costs, either by the Gov-
ernment or the municipalities.
Project Implementation
26.       The Icelandic Harbor Authority (IHA), which has substantial expe-
rience in planning and executing small harbor improvement schemes, would be
responsible for implementing the project and for subsequent maintenance.
However, IRA does not have experience with projects of the size proposed for
Thorlakshofn; engineering consultants would therefore be employed to carry
out detailed soil investigations, prepare engineering and tender documents,
assist in tendering and supervise construction.
Procurement and Disbursements
27.       Rock removal at Grindavik after January 31, 1974 and civil works
at Thorlakshofn would be subject to international competitive bidding in ac-
cordance with the Bank's guidelines. The civil works at liornafjordur, which
would be too small to attract foreign bidders, the installation of navigation
aids and civil works inside the basin at Grindavik would be carried out by



-8-
IHA under force account. Since the cost of the navigation aids and their in-
stallation is small (US$140,000) and they are urgently required, the equipment
would be procured by IRA after requesting at least three quotations from in-
ternational suppliers. A small amount of rock blasting in the Grindavik
channel would be carried out by an experienced local contractor until January
31, 1974. Disbursements would be made for 60 percent of the contract costs
of civil works, and for 75 percent of total expenditures for navigation aids
which would be assembled and installed by Icelandic labor and their installa-
tion, reflecting the estimated foreign exchange costs of both these components,
and 100 percent of foreign expenditures for consulting services.
Economic Benefits
28.       The proposed improvements would provide emergency harborage for
the Vestmannaeyjar fishing vessels and a permanent haven for one-third to
one-half of them. Quantifiable benefits totalling US$2.2 million per year
would accrue after project completion in 1977 through reduction in vessel
damage, an increase in fishing days and reduced waiting time for unloading.
The economic rate of return would be about 28 percent. It would drop to 21
percent if the project costs increased by 25 percent. If all benefits ac-
crued to the project were decreased by 25 percent, the rate would drop to
19 percent. The project would also provide the basic structure for possi-
ble future harbor expansion at Thorlakshofn and Hornafjordur.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
29.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Iceland, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
30.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
31.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
