(LOAN NO.3067-TU)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Small and Medium Scale
Industry Project (SMI II), Turkey, for which Loan 3067-TU in the amount of US$ 204.5 million
equivalent was approved on June 28, 1989 and made effective on October 26, 1989.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1996, compared with the original closing date of June 30,
1995. Total disbursements amounted to $202.3 million equivalent, including funds credited to the Special
Account. Final disbursement under the loan component took place on 03/13/1997. US$2.2 million is
being cancelled. Any funds in the Special Account already disbursed and not accounted for will have to be
refunded, and subsequently cancelled. This issue is being addressed as of this writing.
The draft ICR was prepared by Gurhan Ozdora, Task Manager, RMT. It was reviewed by Franco
Batzella, Division Chief (EC 1 IT). Written contributions were provided by Undersecretariat of Treasury;
Sinai Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi (SYKB); Turkiye Halk Bankasi (THB); Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi (TVB);
Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi (TSKB); Turkish Standards Institute (TSE); State Institute of Statistics
(SIS) and the Export Credit Bank of Turkey ( EXIMBANK), and are included as appendixes to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR started during the Bank's final supervision mission in September 1996. It
is based on material in the project files and data collected after the loan closing date. The Treasury and the
implementing agencies contributed to preparation of the ICR by providing views and evaluation reports on
the Project's execution.

SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3067-TU)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction:
1.    The US $ 204.5 million IBRD loan for The Second Small and Medium Scale Industry
Project was approved in June 1989 and made effective in October 1989. The Bank provided this
loan to the Govemment of Turkey for supporting GOT's program for small and medium scale
enterprise (SMI) development by providing financial, technical and marketing support to promote
efficient SMI investments. The Executing Agencies were five Participating Credit Institutions
(PCIs) for the loan; Turkish Standards Institute (TSE), State Institute for Statistics (SIS) and the
Export Credit Bank of Turkey (EXIIMBANK) for the technical assistance program. The loan was
closed on December 31, 1996, 12 months after the planned completion date of June 30, 1995.
Project Objectives:
2.    The project objectives were: (i) to further assist in the expansion and diversification of
small-and-medium scale industries (SMIs), and to this end; (ii) to improve SMI's access to credit
to finance their investment needs by involving an increasing number of financial intermediaries in
providing such credit; (iii) to provide technical and marketing services to SMIs to assist them in
improving their product quality and in competing in local and export markets; and (iv) to improve
understanding of SMIs problems and prospects through the availability of more reliable statistics
for better policy and project formulation. The project built on the initiatives started under two
previous projects: Labor Intensive Project (1952-TU) and SMI I Project (2647-TU); it was
designed to complement the financial sector restructuring efforts of FSAL II (2694-TU). It
supported the Bank's sectoral strategy for: (i) strengthening the international competitiveness of
the industrial sector; (ii) increasing the production and export capacity of the SMI sector; and
(iii) strengthening the financial intermediaries.
3.    The project's main institutional development objective was to strengthen the PCIs with
particular focus on improving their project appraisal and supervision capabilities. The project also
had a technical assistance component which included: (a) an Export Promotion program
administered through EXIMBANK, to assist small Export Trading Companies (ETCs) to expand
their exports to new markets, (b) a Quality Improvement component administered through TSE,
which aimed at helping SMIs improve quality standards to enhance market acceptance for their



iii
products, and (c) Sector Statistics component, administered by the SIS, aimed at providing more
reliable and accurate data on SMIs for future policy formulation.
Achievement of Objectives
4.    The credit component of the project was to provide financing for SMI investments and
operations in order to support their production capacities, financial structures and market
competitiveness. These objectives were achieved. Overall, the Loan of $200 million financed 250
sub-loans with an average size of $0.8 million, compared to 900 sub-loans at an average size of
$0.2 million envisaged in the SAR. At appraisal, it had been envisaged that PCIs would
contribute $100 million and sub-borrowers $200 million. In reality, the PCIs' contribution was
negligible, but the sub-borrowers provided $610 million, with the net result that total investment
in sub-projects amounted to $810 million, some 62% higher than the $500 million envisaged at
appraisal. These investments were generally viable, yielding real FRRs and ERRs exceeding 30%
on average. Incremental output resulting from these investments is estimated at $716 million and
incremental exports at $442 million at full capacity utilization.
5.    The objective of assisting PCIs in improving their project appraisal-supervision
capabilities, information systems and operating procedures related to SMI lending, was not
realized through the use of loan funds. Apart from an early hardware purchase made by
Emlakbank, the funds earmarked for this purpose, upon the PCIs, request were added to their
credit allocations. Nevertheless, the requirements of the loan agreement relating to project
preparation and appraisal and to the PCI audits contributed substantially to the institutional
improvement of the PCIs and their portfolio quality. Average collection ratios on medium and
long term loans had improved significantly at the closing of the loan.
6.    The Export Promotion component administered by the EXIMBANK was to finance
marketing consultants specialized in product lines predominantly produced by the firms in the
SMI sector. The program was only partly successful. It helped increase the awareness of the
related agencies to the export marketing issues faced by the SMI sector and the need for policy
coordination. However, only 43% of the funds allocated to this component were utilized.
7.    The Quality Improvement component administered by the Turkish Standards Institute
(TSE), aimed at increasing the SMIs' awareness of the importance of standards through training
programs, workshops and promotional literature. To achieve these objectives, training programs
for TSE staff and SMIs were organized. Also, the procurement by TSE of calibration equipment,
hardware and software, was financed by the loan. Some of these programs were also supported
by other related agencies.
8.     The objective of the SMI Statistics component was to help improve the statistical
database on the SMI sector in Turkey. The program, administered by the State Institute for
Statistics (SIS) institutionalized an annual survey of manufacturing industries to collect
performance and structure data according to various size definitions. In addition to this, SIS staff
attended various training programs to increase their technical expertise.

Major Factors Affecting the Project
9.    The loan disbursed successfully during the first three years (1990 - 1992) of
implementation. However, starting with 1993 there was a drastic decrease in the disbursements,
and in 1994 commitments came to a virtual standstill. The reasons for this were: (i) weak
market demand for investment credits due to uncertain macro-economic environment;
(ii) extremely high and fluctuating real rates for foreign exchange risk insurance scheme (FERIS),
the applicable pricing mechanism for SMI II funds; and (iii) the fact that many potential
subprojects were receiving subsidized credits from the Government which made them ineligible
for financing under the loan. In 1993 the Bank agreed with the GOT not to review and approve
sub-loans which were to be used in a blend with subsidized credits from the Treasury.
10.   As a result of this situation and in response to the GOT's request, some amendments were
made in the loan agreement in December 1994. The loan was restructured to allow the financing
of permanent working capital, pre-shipment export finance and leasing. In addition, following the
amendment, loan proceeds could be on-lent on a single-currency basis in US Dollars as well as
DMs with an adequate premium over their respective LIBOR rates.
11.   Following this restructuring, there was a significant acceleration in loan utilization.
Commitments made by the PCIs was 98% of the total loan amount and cumulative disbursements
amounted to $202.3 million, with the final disbursement made in March 13, 1997. The 1994
restructuring was followed by an improved investment climate which gradually developed
throughout 1995. This improvement was due to reactivation of investment decisions which were
postponed because of the economic crisis and also due to new expectations arising from the
customs union with EU. Another aspect of the restructuring was that numerous sub-borrowers
availed themselves of the option to prepay subloans (which was not permitted under the previous
FERIS arrangement), thus made additional funds available to the PCIs for recycling.
12.  In addition to the improvements in the investment climate, another reason for increased
demand for the loan funds, was the unavailability of other sources of medium and long-term
finance. Due to the uncertain macroeconomic environment and high rates of inflation, the
prospects for the banking system and foreign creditors to provide medium and long-term finance
to the private sector was very weak. Given this situation, project funds proved to be very
attractive to investors.
Project Sustainability
13.   Due to the high public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) since 1990, the GOT has
continued to finance its deficit mainly through the sale of government securities. The banks
invested heavily in these instruments, which crowd out medium and long-term lending to private
industry, especially SMIs. Another constraint for the banks is the unavailability of medium-to-
long term funding resources. Under these conditions, it would be unrealistic to expect
commercial banks to provide MLT credit on a sustained basis as envisaged in the project
objectives. However, the success of the credit component in a narrow sense can be considered as
sustainable because loans made in foreign exchange can be recycled: the PCIs can re-lend the
foreign exchange repayments from their sub-borrowers which exceed their repayment obligations



v
to GOT. The current interest rates make project lending profitable for the PCIs, by providing
protection against capital erosion.
14.   The other three components of the project, funded by the TA portion of the loan, will
require further financial and technical support to be sustainable. The export promotion
component also needs clear definitions of objectives of the relevant national agencies. The level
of staff quality and technical capabilities of both TSE and SIS has improved remarkably as a
result of the project; however, continued infusion of funds are needed in order to maintain these
results.
Bank Performance.
15.   The Bank's performance at preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. Bank missions
drew on the experiences of the two earlier SMI projects one of the Labor Intensive Project (1952-
TU and 2647-TU). The number of PCIs involved in the project increased. The selection of PCIs
was made according to their SMI loan portfolios and to their technical expertise in project
lending. The Bank's performance during the implementation phase was also satisfactory.
Supervision missions were fielded at regular intervals twice per year and the relationship of Bank
staff with the Treasury and implementing agencies' staff was excellent. Treasury and the PCIs
also rate the project implementation as highly satisfactory.
Borrower Performance
16.   The performance of the GOT and the implementing agencies was highly satisfactory in
some aspects, satisfactory in others and deficient in some. The performance of the PCIs in
carrying out the credit operations, and their compliance with the financial covenants agreed under
the Project, was satisfactory in general. Treasury also contributed to a smooth operation of the
credit line. Two of the PCIs, Emlakbank (EB) and Halkbank (THB) had some problems in
meeting the eligibility criteria of the loan agreement and EB was suspended from participation in
the project in 1992. THB's participation after the 1994 restructuring of the project was made
conditional on a favorable review of its eligibility; this remained in suspense until end 1996 (when
the loan was fully committed), due to strong qualifications in its audit reports and weakening of
its capital base and portfolio quality. The performances of both TSE and SIS were highly
satisfactory, and the technical assistance and training programs financed by the loan for these two
agencies were successful and consistent with the objectives of the loan. The export promotion
component administered by the EXIMBANK was unsatisfactory due to deficiencies in the design
of the consultancy programs.
Assessment of Outcome and Future Operation
17.   The Project achieved most of its objectives. Its outcome is satisfactory, despite the delays
in implementation caused to a large extent by the economic environment. A plan for the project's
future operation is attached as Annex A.



vi
Key Lessons Learned
18.   Several lessons have been learned: (i) entrepreneurs like predictable debt service
obligations and prefer assuming the foreign exchange risk rather than covering it at the cost of
fluctuating relative and high interest rates; (ii) in economies with a high rate of inflation, sound
economic and financial retums can be obtained if lending activities are sheltered from the effects
of inflation through appropriate interest rate mechanisms; (iii) free-standing permanent working
capital loans with long-term maturities, can be vital for the enterprises in economies where banks
are reluctant to provide medium-to-long term financing, due to macro-economic uncertainty;
(iv) for export- oriented enterprises, borrowing in foreign exchange does not entail the same
degree of FX risk as is the case for non-exporting firms; (v) lending mechanisms should be simple
so that sub-borrowers understand their obligations; (vi) when problems arise between the Bank
and the Borrower, solutions should be sought right after the emergence of the problems; (vii) a
credit line can be highly satisfactory even in an inflationary environment if negative real interest
rates are avoided by lending in foreign exchange or indexing of sub-loans to foreign currencies;
(viii) sub-project performance can be improved substantially through close ex-ante and ex-post
review and supervision of the Bank; and (ix) the success of technical assistance programs for
SMIs, implemented through government agencies, depend greatly on the degree of cooperation
between these agencies and acceptance of the program by the private sector beneficiaries.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN NO.3067-TU)
Part I. Project Implementation Assessment
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.    In the Loan Agreement, the project objectives were stated as follows: (i) to further assist
Turkey in the expansion and diversification of small-and-medium scale industries (SMIs) and, to
this end; (ii) to improve SMI's access to credit to finance their investment needs by involving an
increasing number of financial intermediaries in providing such credit; (iii) to provide technical
and marketing services to SMIs to assist them in improving their product quality and in competing
in local and export markets; and (iv) to improve the understanding of the SMIs' problems and
prospects through the availability of more reliable statistics for better policy and project
formulation. The project aimed to achieve these objectives by channeling the equivalent of
US$200 million through Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) to finance eligible investments of
SMIs, and by financing technical assistance and training in the amount of US$4.5 million
equivalent for the PCIs and other agencies supporting SMI development, EXIMBANK, TSE and
SIs.
2.    The project was intended to support the Bank's strategy by: (i) assisting the GOT to
achieve its "base case" macro-economic framework by focusing on priority sectors;
(ii) strengthening the international competitiveness of the industrial sector by supporting export
and technological development as the critical agenda for the long term; and (iii) developing a
stronger and more diversified financial sector to facilitate the growth of a dynamic, competitive
and export-oriented private industry. It was considered to be supplementary to the two previous
SMI projects (1952-TU and 2647-TU) and to the Second Financial Sector Adjustment Loan
(2964-TU) because it supported the financial sector adjustment effort at the institutional level, and
assisted the PCIs in strengthening their operational policies, procedures and information systems.
3.    While the two previous SMI projects helped increase the SMIs' access to financial,
technical and marketing assistance, the institutional mechanisms to deliver these services
effectively had to be expanded and improved with a view to enable the SMI sector to increase
output, exports and employment opportunities in line with its growth potential. Therefore,
continuation of Bank's assistance was needed to assure flow of funds to the PCIs to expand their
SMI portfolio, and to provide technical assistance to make them more effective and efficient at
SMI financing.
4.    The project's main institutional development objective was to strengthen the effectiveness
of the PCI's with particular emphasis on improving their appraisal and supervision methods,
systems and procedures, through staff training and improvement of the software and hardware
used for the evaluation of SMI investments. These objectives supplemented those of previous
Bank operations, particularly FSAL II with respect to the institutional strengthening of the PCIs.



2
5.    The project's other institutional development objectives were to improve the effectiveness
of the agencies responsible for assisting the SMIs in the areas of export promotion, quality
standards, and statistical support. These objectives were flushed through technical assistance and
training program, targeted to EXIMBANK, TSE and SIS.
6.    The technical assistance program for export promotion administered through
EXIMBANK was intended to assist the small Export Trading Companies (ETCs) to expand their
exports to new markets, and also help increase cooperation among organizations involved in
various aspects of SMI exporting. The Quality Improvement component administered through
TSE was aimed at assisting the SMIs to achieve quality standards that would improve the market
acceptance for their products, and at increasing the quality certification capacity of TSE. The
Statistics component was aimed at improving the statistical database on the SMI sector and at
developing a nationwide system for data collection, processing and analysis for SMI enterprises.
Administered by the SIS, this component was designed to institutionalize and improve the annual
survey capabilities of SIS in order to provide more reliable and accurate database for future
policy formulation for the SMI sector.
B. Achievement of Objectives
7.    The project aimed at expanding the financial, technical and marketing support for the
SMIs to enable them to increase their contribution to industrial employment, exports and output
through: (i) improving their access to credit to finance their investment needs; (ii) provision of
technical and marketing services to SMIs to assist them in improving their product quality and
competitive standing in local and export markets; and (iii) improving the understanding of SMIs
problems and prospects through the availability of more reliable statistics.
8.    The credit component of the project aimed to support efficient SMI investments and
operations by improving SMIs access to credit through increasing the number of financial
intermediaries for SMI finance and the volume of project financing channeled by them to the SMI
sector. These objectives were fully achieved. The amount of the loan allocated for PCI subloans,
which was $200 million originally, was increased to $201.5 million and later to $202.3 million, as
a result of PCIs' request to use the TA portion allocated to them for subloans. Although the loan
was 100 % committed, disbursements, amounted to 99% of the allocation due to some
cancellations by the subborrowers at the end of the year. Overall, the Loan of $200.3 million
financed 250 sub-loans with an average size of $0.8 million, compared to 900 sub-loans at an
average size of $0.2 million envisaged in the SAR. At appraisal, it had been envisaged that PCIs
would contribute $100 million and sub-borrowers $200 million. The actual results were that the
PCIs' contribution was negligible, but the sub-borrowers provided $610 million, with the net
result of total investment in sub-projects of $810 million, some 62% higher than the $500 million
envisaged at appraisal. Incremental output resulting from these investments is estimated at $716
million and incremental exports as $442 million, at full capacity utilization. ERRs and FRRs were
calculated for individual sub-projects. The appraisal reports prepared by the PCIs for individual
sub-projects showed ERRs ranging from 14% to 189% and FRRs ranging from 16% to 162%. A
post-evaluation exercise carried out by the PCIs on a sample of 14 sub-projects revealed that



3
actual ERRs range from 32 % to 41% and FRRs from 39 % to 44%. According to these reports,
the Loan helped to finance $810 million in incremental investment and created 19,700 full-time
jobs.
9.    The original allocation of loan funds to TA to PCIs for improving their project appraisal
and supervision capabilities, information systems and operating procedures, was not utilized.
However, the procedures for appraisal and supervision of subloans agreed under the project
contributed substantially to the institutional strengthening of the PCIs and to the improvements in
their portfolio quality. Financial objectives related to the financial performance of PCIs, were
fully achieved, i.e., debt-to-equity and capital adequacy as well as collection ratio covenants were
complied with. Two of the PCIs had some problems with the eligibility criteria described in the
financial covenants of the loan agreement. EB's participation in the project was suspended in
1992. THB's participation was suspended in 1994 and made conditional on its meeting the
eligibility criteria. This was still in question when the loan was fully committed in December,
1996. In both cases these difficulties were brought out in the audit reports required by the loan
covenant.
10.   The Export Promotion Component administered by the EXIMBANK was designed to
finance marketing consultants specialized in product lines predominantly produced by the firms
in the SMI sector. These consultants were expected to bring expertise and information about the
market demands and product specifications directly to the SMIs and work with Export Trading
Companies (ETC) and their domestic suppliers to assist in developing their product design and
competitiveness. This component was only partially successful, of the US$1.5 million equivalent
allocated for this component, 43% was used for financing various surveys and studies by the
foreign and local consultants and for training seminars and programs, designed to bring the
related government agencies and representatives of SMI firms together for discussions and
brainstorming sessions. The remaining 57% was transferred to a pool to be utilized for the credit
component of the project.
11.   The Quality Improvement Component was administered by the Turkish Standards
Institute (TSE). This component aimed at increasing the awareness of the SMI sector to the
importance of standards through training programs, workshops and promotional literature. To
achieve these objectives TSE organized various training programs for the SMIs some of which
were also supported by other public agencies. The other important aim of this component was to
establish mobile certification capability for SMI standards. This was also achieved by procuring
mobile calibration laboratories, tools, hardware and software equipment for TSE and KOSGEB
which were financed through this loan. The allocation for this component was $1.0 million and
almost all was disbursed.
12.   The objective of the SMI Statistics Component was to improve the statistical database on
the SMI sector in Turkey. Administered by the State Institute for Statistics (SIS) the program
aimed to institutionalize an annual survey of manufacturing industries which would collect
performance and structure data according to various firm size definitions. In addition to this,
various training programs were organized to train the SIS staff and to institutionalize the
program within the SIS. The allocation for this component was $0.5 million and almost all of the
funds have been disbursed. The program has made substantial contribution to increasing the
technological level of SIS and professional expertise of its personnel. Introduction of higher

technology has shortened the processing time, increased the quality of surveys and has enabled the
SIS to collect and process more detailed and relevant data from the industry groups, thus enabling
the SIS to create an accurate and wider database for the SMIs. The project has been most useful
in increasing the level of awareness and technology orientation of the SIS as an institution.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
13.   The loan had disbursed successfully during the first three years (1990 - 1992) and
cumulative disbursements were $122 million at end- 1992, 60% of the loan amount, which was in
excess of the original disbursement estimates. However starting with 1993 there was a drastic
decrease in the disbursements. Only 17% of the planned yearly disbursements could be realized in
1993, and only 11% in 1994. New commitments came to a virtual standstill. The reasons for
this were: (i) The abundance, in the banking system of funds from roll-over foreign currency
financing which, when blended with subsidized loans by the Treasury, proved to be a more
attractive alternative until foreign exchange credit dried up with the financial crisis of 1994;
(ii) weak market demand for investment credits due to uncertain macro-economic environment;
(iii) extremely high and fluctuating real rates for FERIS, the applicable pricing mechanism for
SMI II funds; and (iv) the fact that many potential subprojects benefitted from subsidized credits
from the Government, which made them ineligible for financing under the Bank's project. In
1993, the Bank, in agreement with the GOT, stopped reviewing and approving sub-loans which
were to be used in a blend with subsidized credits from the Treasury.
14.   In addition, project implementation was also influenced by the macro-economic factors.
The inflation rate which was 70% in 1988 persisted at high levels through the 1990s, averaging
over 60% and reaching a level of 80% at the end of 1996. The exchange rate developed at a
similar pace until early 1994, then skyrocketed with the financial crisis of April, 1994. From TL
1,875 for one US dollar in January 1989, it reached TL 17,204 in January 1994 and TL 33,408 in
April 1994, to jump to TL 126,600 at the end of March 1997. Project loans initially, were made
at the FERIS rate which was based on the three-month Treasury bill rate. Due to high inflation
and irregularity of auctions for these bills, there were large fluctuations in the FERIS rates
because in absence of three-month bills, the six-month Treasury bill rates were used, and since
these rates were generally higher than the three-month bills, FERIS rates increased accordingly.
Another flaw of the FERIS mechanism was the inadmissibility of prepayments. With very high
real rates, debt financing for investments became unattractive, even though FERIS allowed for
capitalization of half of the interest during the grace period. These factors, combined with the
ineligibility of the projects benefiting from the GOT's incentive program, brought commitments to
a standstill.
15.   As a result of this situation and in response to the GOT's request in 1994, GOT and the
Bank agreed to restructure the loan to take into account the new circumstances. Accordingly,
the loan agreement was amended on December 29,1994 as follows: (i) the FERIS scheme was
discontinued; (ii) onlending of loan funds was allowed on a single currency basis, in US dollars or
Deutsch Marks at market-oriented interest rates no longer tied to the World Bank pool rate; and
(iii) free-standing permanent working capital loans, and loans for pre-export financing and
equipment leasing, were permitted.



5
16.   Following this restructuring, the loan utilization and commitments resumed at a brisk
pace. The disbursements by the PCIs was 98% of the total loan amount and cumulatively
amounted to $202.3 million, with the final disbursement made in March 13,1997. The 1994
restructuring was followed by an improved investment climate due to reactivation of investment
decisions which were postponed because of the economic crisis and also due to new expectations
arising from the customs union with EU. Another aspect of the restructuring was that many
subprojects availed themselves of the option to prepay the subloans (which was not allowed under
the FERIS scheme). This increased the availability of funds to the PCIs for further lending.
17.   In addition to the improvements in the investment climate, another reason for increased
demand for the Bank funds, was the unavailability of other means of medium and long-term
sources of finance after the financial crisis of April, 1994. Due to uncertain macro-economic
environment and high rates of inflation, the prospects for the banking system and foreign
creditors to provide medium-and-long term finance to the private sector was very weak. Given
this situation, Bank loans proved to be very attractive to investors.
D.    Project Sustainability
Project Sustainability
18.   Due to high public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) since 1990, the GOT has
continued to finance its deficit mainly through the sale of government securities. The banks,
attracted by their high-yield and low-risk profile, have been investing heavily in these instruments.
This development in turn has resulted in a crowding-out of medium and long-term lending to
industry, especially SMI, by the banks. Another constraint for the banks is the unavailability of
medium-to-long-term funding resources. Under these conditions, it would be unrealistic to expect
the credit component to be sustainable as envisaged in the project. However, the successful
utilization of the credit component in itself can be considered as sustainable. This is because,
unlike under the FERIS scheme where repaid funds could not revolve, for the sub-loans made in
foreign exchange can. The PCIs have the opportunity to re-lend part of the foreign exchange
repayments from their sub-borrowers which exceeds their repayment obligations to GOT. Funds
recycled in this way, can be used for the same purposes and since the subloans are denominated
in foreign exchange. Demand for these funds is expected to continue. The current interest rates
make project lending profitable for the PCIs, by providing protection against capital erosion.
19.   From the point of view of recoveries and in terms of the financial viability of the PCIs, the
Project can be considered as sustainable. The interest spread of 3% to the PCIs under FERIS and
the flexible margins for foreign exchange loans, are adequate. All amounts disbursed are being
recovered and the PCIs, except THB and EB, met all of the financial covenants. THB, after the
restructuring in 1995 was not able to participate in the lending since it could not meet the number
of eligibility criteria due to the deterioration of its financial condition as highlighted by strong
qualifications in audit reports of the independent auditors. The Project is also sustainable for the
sub-borrowers. They have greatly benefited from the investments made under the Project by
expanding and modernizing their plants, increased their outputs and capacity utilization rates and
have developed good sense of financial discipline.



6
20.   The capabilities of the PCIs in the appraisal, supervision and monitoring of the lending
activities are satisfactory and their credit and project evaluation departments deal efficiently with
the sub-projects using recycled funds. Sub-loans under FERIS carried sufficiently high interest
rates to cover for the inflation losses and foreign exchange sub-loans have to be paid in foreign
currency.
21.   The Quality Improvement and Statistics components has been successful in supporting
institution building and increasing the technical capabilities of TSE and SIS. To maintain these
achievements, however, further financial and technical support will be required by the two
agencies in the future. The export promotion component has been only partially successful.
EXIMBANK's effectiveness has benefited somewhat from the TA financed under the loan.
However, it would need clearer definitions of objectives and enlistment of support from related
public agencies.
E. Bank Performance
22.   The Bank's performance at preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. Bank's missions had
the necessary expertise to draw from the experiences and results of the two earlier SMI projects;
The Labor Intensive Project (1952-TU) and SMI I project (2647-TU). The number of PCIs
involved in the project was increased on the basis of sound criteria: SMI portfolio, financial
strength; and project financing expertise, in line with OD 8.30 of the Bank's Guidelines.
23.   Bank performance during the implementation phase was also satisfactory. Supervision
missions visited participating banks, at regular intervals twice per year, and the relationship of
Bank staff with the Treasury and with implementing agencies staff was excellent. Treasury and
PCIs maintain that the Bank could have been more flexible in permitting the utilization of loan
funds in a blend with subsidized credit and that if this had been the case, project implementation
could have been much faster. Although the possibility of improving project implementation
through a compromise on this issue had been explored, Bank management adhered to the
principle of not supporting subsidized credit. The Bank was flexible, however, in restructuring
the loan at the end of 1994, which permitted the PCIs to make subloans denominated in US
Dollars or Deutsche Marks, rather than based on the FERIS scheme, charging interest at market
rates.
F. Borrower Performance
24.    The performance of GOT and the implementing agencies were highly satisfactory in some
aspects, satisfactory in others and deficient in some. The performance of the PCIs in carrying out
the credit operations and meeting the financial covenants agreed under the Project was
satisfactory. Treasury also contributed to a smooth operation of the credit line. Two of the PCIs,
Emlakbank (EB) and Halkbank (THB) had some problems in meeting the financial covenants of
the loan agreement. As a result of this, EB was excluded from participation in the project in 1992
and THB's participation was suspended after the restructuring in 1994 subject to its restoring



7
compliance with the eligibility criteria. THB's financial status had deteriorated considerably, as
also indicated by their independent auditors.
25.   The performance of both TSE and SIS were highly satisfactory and in both cases the
performance of the implementing agencies and the consultancy and training programs financed by
the loan proved to be consistent with the objectives of the loan. The export promotion
component administered by the EXIMBANK was partly satisfactory due to deficiencies in the
design of the consultancy services.
26.   The major covenants related to the institutional development and financial strength of the
PCIs were met and therefore compliance with the loan covenants must be rated as satisfactory.
G. Assessment of Outcome
27.   The project achieved nearly all of its objectives, but its implementation took longer than
planned. The delay was caused by the difficult economic environment and problems by
disagreement between the Bank and the Borrower concerning subsidized credit. The project
would have been rated as unsatisfactory in November 1994, but it made a significant turn around
due to the successful restructuring and to the improved investment climate. Since then, the
performance of the project has been highly satisfactory. This leads to an overall rating of
satisfactory.
H. Future Operation
28.   A plan for the future operations has been agreed with the GOT, PCIs, TSE and the SIS.
It contains the following arrangements: (i) the reflow of funds will be used in lending for similar
purposes until all funds have been repaid to the GOT as specified in the legal agreements; and
(ii) TSE and the SIS have agreed on ways and means to make use of the findings and results of
the studies and surveys and to contribute to the SMIs development in the future.
I. Key Lessons Learned
29.   Several lessons have been learned: (i) entrepreneurs like predictable debt service
obligations and prefer assuming the foreign exchange risk rather than covering it at the cost of
relative and high interest rates; (ii) in economies with a high rate of inflation, sound economic and
financial returns can be obtained if lending activities are sheltered from the effects of inflation
through appropriate interest rate mechanisms; (iii) free-standing permanent working capital loans
with long-term maturities, can be vital for the enterprises in economies where banks are reluctant
to provide medium-to-long term financing, due to macro-economic uncertainty; (iv) for export-
oriented enterprises, borrowing in foreign exchange does not entail the same degree of FX risk as
is the case for non-exporting firms; (v) lending mechanisms should be designed simple so that sub-
borrowers understand their obligations; (vi) when problems arise between the Bank and the



8
Borrower, solutions should be sought right after the emergence of the problems; (vii) a credit line
can be highly satisfactory even in an inflationary environment if negative real interest rates are
avoided by lending in foreign exchange or indexing of sub-loans to foreign currencies; (viii) sub-
project performance can be improved substantially through close ex-ante and ex-post review and
supervision of the Bank; and (ix) the success of technical assistance programs for SMIs,
implemented through government agencies, depend greatly on the degree of cooperation between
these agencies and acceptance of the program by the private sector beneficiaries.

Employment Impact. At appraisal, the project was expected to invest in relatively labor intensive
projects with an incremental cost per job usually not exceeding US$15,385. Estimates of additional jobs
made at the time of PCI appraisal was for a total of 19,700 jobs from the Investment Projects at a cost
per job of $41,165.

TURKEY
SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
(Loan 3067-TU)
Plan for Proiect Overation after Closine on June 30, 1997
Project Objective
30.   The project objectives as stated in the loan agreement were: (i) to further assist in the
expansion and diversification of small-and-medium scale industries (SMIs), and, to this end; (ii) to
improve SMI's access to credit to finance their investment needs by involving an increasing
number of financial intermediaries in providing such credit; (iii) to provide technical and
marketing services to SMIs to assist them in improving their product quality and in competing in
local and export markets; and (iv) to improve understanding of SMIs problems and prospects
through the availability of more reliable statistics for better policy and project formulation.
31.   The institutional development objectives for the PCIs were to improve their project
appraisal and supervision methods, systems and procedures through training and software and
hardware improvements. Covenants in the Project also related to strengthening of the PCIs'
financial structures and the continuation of organizational and human resource development .
32.   It was a sector policy objective specified in FSAL II to bring about positive interest rates.
For the SMI II Project, positive real rates were to be attained by using the Foreign Exchange
Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) mechanism. Under FERIS, the Government converted the
proceeds of foreign loans into TL-denominated loans with a variable rate set at the average of the
three-month Treasury bill rate over the preceding three months. Additionally, the option of
lending in foreign exchange through the Bank's pool rate was offered. Since there was no use of
the foreign exchange option under the pool rate, GOT agreed in 1994 to convert the pool of
currencies to single-currency sub-loans to the PCIs.
33.   The technical assistance was designed to support export product and market development
of SMI enterprises by selected Export Trading Companies (ETC); develop a product quality
assurance program for SMI units by the Turkish Standards Institute (TSE); and help finance the
effort of the State Institute of Statistics (SIS) to improve SMI data gathering, processing and
analysis to increase reliability and accuracy of sector statistics.
34.   These objectives remain valid after the implementation of the project and the full
disbursement of the project funds. Since the PCIs have the opportunity under foreign exchange
lending (not under FERIS) to roll over the funds obtained for a certain number of years, the
backflow of funds will be used to support lending operations for similar purposes until all funds
have been repaid to GOT as stated in the Loan Agreement. Equally important, the institutional
development of the PCIs will continue along the lines that were started in this and other projects
supported by the World Bank. The objectives of the technical assistance components related to
the improvements in the technical capabilities of the TSE and SIS should be complemented by the
cooperation of the agencies, public and private, in policy formulation for the SMI sector.



18
Future Proiect Overations
35.    The Loan was made to the Government of Turkey (GOT) for 17 years including five years
of grace period. On-lending maturities to the PCIs depend on the type of investment financed.
Under FERIS, sub-loans are made for periods up to ten years including three years of grace and
repayment by the PCIs to GOT is at identical terms, i.e., no possibility of revolving the funds
exist. For sub-loans made in foreign exchange, maturities to sub-borrowers are up to eight years
including three years of grace for investment projects, up to eight years with no grace period for
permanent working capital. The PCIs have thus the opportunity to revolve the part of the foreign
exchange repayments from client that exceeds their repayment obligations to GOT.
36.    The legal agreements stipulate that the backflows of funds will be used for similar
purposes. The PCIs confirm that they intend to follow this agreement and make loans to
individual sub-borrowers for similar purposes until all funds have been repaid to GOT. It is likely
that the bulk of funds to be reinvested will be used to finance investment loans. In this sense, this
Plan of Operation foresees that the Loan will continue to benefit the SMI sector. PCIs intend to
supervise the portfolio of sub-loans outstanding in accordance with the agreed procedures until all
fiunds have been repaid.
37.    Institutional development will remain one of the PCIs' main objectives. They will aim to
further strengthen their financial position and to maintain compliance with the financial covenants
set out in the legal agreements.

GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY
SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT (3067-TU)
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
1. This report presents the overall view of the Government of Turkey (GOT) as represented by the
Undersecreteriat of Treasury on the outcome of Second Small and Medium Scale Industry
Project(3067-TU). Comments on the Project results have been prepared with input from the
participating agencies which are the State Institute of Statistics (SIS), Turkish Standards Institute (TSE),
Export Credit Bank of Turkey (EXIMBANK); and from the participating credit institutions (PCIs)
which are Emlakbank, Halkbank, SKYB, TSKB and Vakyfbank.
2. The US $ 204.5 million IBRD loan for The Second Small and Medium Scale Industry Project was
approved in June 1989 and made effective in October 1989. The Bank provided this Loan to the GOT
for supporting its program for small and medium scale enterprise (SMI) development by providing
financial, technical and marketing support to promote efficient SMI investments. The executing
agencies were Turkish Standards Institute (TSE), Sate Institute of Statistics (SIS) and EXIMBANK for
the technical assistance program. The Loan was closed on December 31, 1996, 12 months after the
planned completion date of June 30, 1995.
3. The project objectives as stated in the loan agreement were to: (i) further assist in the expansion and
diversification of SMIs, and to this end; (ii) improve SMI's access to credit to finance their investment
needs by involving an increasing number of financial intermediaries in providing such credit; (iii)
provide technical and marketing services to SMIs to assist them in improving their product quality and
in competing in local and export markets; and (iv) acquire a better understanding of SMI's problems
and prospects through improving the availability of more reliable statistical data for better policy and
project formulation.
4. Initially subloans made in local currency turned out to be unattractive for investors starting in 1992.
This was because the FERIS rates, which were based on the rates of three-month Treasurv bills, reached
very high levels in the wake of the Gulf crisis. Consequently lending through the PCIs came to a virtual
standstill due to lack of demand. To remedy the situation, GOT, in 1992, announced an investment
incentive program offering a range of financial benefits to investors which included small amounts of
subsidized credit. As a reaction, the World Bank decided to stop approving sub-loans which were to be
used in a blend with subsidized credit from GOT, despite the fact that no reference to such an event
existed in the Loan Agreement.
5. In 1994, due to reasons of fiscal policy, GOT excluded subsidized credit from benefits given through
investment encouragement certificates. It was at that time that GOT and the World Bank agreed on
restructuring the Loan with the objective to accelerate Loan disbursements. In the amendment of
December 29, 1994 to the Loan Agreement: (i) the interest rate base for single-currency US dollar or
Deutsche Mark foreign exchange loans was made more market-oriented; (ii) free-standing working
capital loans were allowed; and (iii) loans for equipment leasing and pre-export financing were also
permitted. These changes, together with a more favourable business climate in 1995, contributed to a
full commitment of the funds by the end of 1996. The necessary amendments should have been made
long before, but The Bank's rigid posture prevented such flexibility. The standstill situation as a result
of the Bank's irresponsiveness to the prevailing market and investment conditions lasted more than two
years and costed GOT dearly in terms of commitment fees and opportunity losses. It also impeded an
effective support scheme for SMIs. It was an opportunity loss to the Bank, as well.



6. Following this long due restructuring, there was a significant acceleration in the loan utilization and
commitments which totaled $203 million or 98 % of the total loan amount, with the final disbursement
made in March 13, 1997.
7. During implementation a total number of 250 subloans were financed with the proceeds of the loan.
The economic impact of the credit component of the Project has been very positive. It provided much-
needed long-term funds to sub-sectors in need of investment capital, benefiting both the sub-borrowers
and the financial structure of PCIs handling the Project. PCIs benefited by making adequate spreads on
the Loan and have been successful in loan collections under the Project. Although it was implemented
in difficult economic situations, the Project clearly supported investment in niches of high export and
development potential through sound financial institutions. This project makes it clear that the Bank
should be ready to revise its fanatic concern for macroeconomic variables, when the circumstances
necessitate. Otherwise the Bank will miss many opportunities to help develop efficient export-oriented
SMIs in the developing nations. Even under some macroeconomic instability, promoting competitive
SMIs can financially be viable and helps the process of economic development.
8. The PCIs were effective in achieving their objectives. They improved their appraisal capabilities and
complied with the legal requirements of sound financial structure and reporting. The supervision
missions of the World Bank were fielded at regular intervals twice per year and they reached a good
working relationship with the implementing agencies that were conducive to the attainment of the
Project objectives. In this regard, we would we like to express our appreciation to the staff of the World
Bank including the Resident Mission in Ankara.
9. Quality Improvement and Statistics components have been successful in supporting institution building
and increasing technical capabilities. Technical assistance portion of the loan will require further
financial and technical support to become sustainable. In the case of export promotion component, SAR
should have been designed in such a way to set more clear goals and a better strategy to get
commitment from interested parties to augment the positive effects of the project. For the other two
components, there has been a significant contribution in increasing the level of staff quality and
technical capabilities of both the TSE and the SIS. The performance of both TSE and SIS were highly
satisfactory and in both cases the performance of the implementing agencies and the consultancy and
training programs financed by the loan proved to be very conducive to the objectives of the loan.
However for both agencies, continued infusion of funds and investment is needed, if they are to meet
the future demands of the SMI sector.
10. The export promotion component administered by the EXIMBANK was unsatisfactory due to
deficiencies in the design of the consultancy services.
11. Overall, we would consider the perfornance of the Project as highly satisfactory despite the delays in
implementation caused mid-way by economic factors and bureaucratic impediments of the Bank. The
following lessons have been learned: (i) entrepreneurs prefer to borrow in foreign exchange at
relatively stable interest rates in an inflationary economy; (ii) a credit project, if designed properly,
can achieve its objectives in terms of economic and financial benefits even under relatively instable
macroeconomic environment; (iii) FERIS is not an effective and sustainable mechanism to smoothen
exchange risks.
12. Finally, it is extremely hard to understand after the completion of such a successful project, (and also
taking into consideration the similar success of the Agro Industry Project), why the Bank is so
irresponsive and reluctant to consider further lending of this kind. The Bank should reconsider its rigid
posture, especially in the case of Turkey, that lending to competitive industries and sectors, contributes
substantially to the industrial base of Turkey, as well as to the attainment of macroeconomic stability
even under some macroeconomic impediments. Despite reiterated indications of interest by GOT for a
repeater credit line, the Bank appears never to have considered inclusion of such projects in its lending
program.
