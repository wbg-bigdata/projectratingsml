technical assistance to the Turkish Standards
Institute, selected export trading companies, the
State Institute of Statistics, and the Small

Amount:                     US$204.5 million equivalent
Terms:                      Seventeen years, including a five-year grace
period, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.
Relending Terms:            The final lending rate to subborrowers would be the
prevailing variable Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE SECOND SMALL AND MEDIUM SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.       The following report ori a proposed loan to Turkey for US$204.5
million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would have a
repayment period of seventeen years, including a five-year grace period, and
interest at the Bank's variable rate, and would help finance the Second Small
and Medium Scale Industry Project.
2.       Background.  Small and medium scale industry (SMI) units are defined
as industrial enterprises with fixed assets (excluding land and buildings) not
exceeding US$4 million or those employing less than 100 workers. As defined,
the SMI sector constitutes about 89% of all private manufacturing enterprises,
accounts for about 372 of total private manufacturing employment, contributes
about 272 of private manufacturing value-added and is an important supplier of
Turkey's manufactured exports. The Government of Turkey has attached priority
to this sector in view of the need to increase employment, reduce regional
income disparities, and expand exports.
3.       Project Obiectives.  The Bank, through two projects, has helped the
Government meet the needs of the SMI sector by encouraging two financial
institutions to expand their SMI lending activities and guiding a public
agency in providing promotional and extension services to the SMI sector. The
proposed project would further these initiatives by: (i) promoting and
supporting efficient SKI investments and operations; (ii) improving credit
access for SMI by increasing significantly the number of financial
institutions that can serve as efficient intermediaries for SMI finance and by
providing credit at efficient market prices; (iii) improving SMI product
quality and expanding their markets by providing technical and marketing
assistance; and (iv) enhancing policy making for the SMI sector through more
reliable statistics.
4.       Project Description.  To meet the above objectives, the proposed
project would have the following components: (i) credit lines to the
participating credit institutions for onlending as subloans for fixed
investment and permanent working capital for SMI subprojects that are
financially and economically viable; (ii) technical assistance to the PCIs to
help them become more efficient channels for SMI finance; (iii) technical and
marketing support services for SMIs by providing quality improvement services
and expanding export marketing linkages between SMIs and export trading
companies; and (iv) assistance to improve understanding of this sector through
improved statistics. A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan is
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements,
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A time table of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Turkey
are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7546-TU dated May 4, 1989 is being distributed separately.

5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  While earlier projects assisted by
the Bank have helped increase SMI's access to financial, technical and
marketing assistance, the institutional mechanisms that can deliver these
services effectively have to be expanded and improved to enable SMI to reach
its potential. Financial institutions are not yet fully equipped to handle
SMI lending and are still averse to financing SMI units due to perceptions of
higher risks associated with lending to this sector and higher administrative
costs associated with smaller loans. Hence, equity financing and informal
credit sources at very high costs continue to be the major source of financing
for SMI. The Bank's continued assistance is needed to assure adequate
long-term funds for existing and other financial institutions *o expand their
SMI portfolio, and also as a means of providing technical assistance to make
them more effective and efficient at SMI financing. In the area of technology
and market development, the Bank has a '-Untinuing role in assisting both
public and private sector institutions in providing technical and marketing
services more effectively.
6.       Agreed Actions.  The Government of Turkey has agreed on the
following: a) that the Government would bear the exchange and interest rate
risks of the subloans because the ultimate subborrowers are small and medium
enterprises with relatively little capacity to judge and hedge against these
risks; and b) that the fixed rate FERIS be abolished and that FERIS be placed
completely on a variable rate basis to make the interest rate be reflective of
market conditions.
7.       Justification.  The proposed project would support the expansion and
modernization of the SMI sector which makes significant contributions to
employment, exports and output growth. The Bank loan would fill a significant
portion of the resource gap for SMI financing and would help the participating
credit institutions become more efficient channels for SMI lending. It is
anticipated that about 900 subprojects would be financed, resulting in fixed
investments of about US$400 million. On the basis of experiences with earlier
projects supported by the Bank, it is estimated that about 26,000 new full
time jobs may be created. The subprojects financed are expected to be fairly
labor intensive with a cost per job usually not exceeding US$15,000, to employ
less skilled workers or new entrants into the labor force, to produce for
exports both directly and indirectly, and to process local raw materials with
close linkages with the agricultural sector.
8.       Risks.  No unusual risks are foreseen in the implementation of the
proposed project. There is a risk that participating banks may not pay
sufficient attention to SMI lending considering the small size of this
operation in relation to the total business of these banks. Major criteria in
the selection of the PCIs included their interest in, and firm plans for,
0391R



-3-
developing an important SMI portfolio and consistency of SMI lending with
their corporate strategies. Separate monitoring and reporting will be
required to ensure attention to this operation by the top managements of these
banks. There is a risk that, due to weaknesses in staffing and procedures,
the public sector institutions will be unable to play the roles assigned to
them for the technical assistance components of the project. Training and
consultancy assistance under the project would be provided to strengthen these
institutions wbile the private sector is expected to play an important role in
monitoring and ensuring effective project implementation.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
