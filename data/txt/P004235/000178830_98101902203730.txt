REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA FOR THE SECOND
KUAIA LUMPUR WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$13.5 million to help finance the
second stage of the Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project. The loan would have
a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 74 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report dated March 20, 1972 was circulated to
the Executive Directors on March 23, 1972(R72-63). An economic mission
visited Malaysia in November/December 1972 and its report will be circulated
shortly. The principal conclusions are discussed below. Country data for
Malaysia are included in Annex I.
3.        During the sixties, the Malaysian economy showed a remarkable
resilience and demonstrated its fundamental strength. The country was
hit by a series of adverse political and economic events - such as the
separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, the con-
frontation with Indonesia until 1966, the communal riots in 1969, and a
deterioration of its terms of trade, mainly as a result of the steady fall
in the price of rubber. In spite of these setbacks the Malaysian economy
con;.inued on a strong and steady course with real GNP growing at about 6
percent per annum.
4.        The principal factors supporting this growth were increased
exports of rubber, following dramatic production increases in the early
sixties through massive replanting with improved varieties, and the rapid
rise of timber and palm oil exports. The annual growth rate of export
earnings, principally of primary commodities sales, was 5.3 percent.
Encouragement of import substitution in a context of liberal investment
policies caused manufacturing to grow at about 11 percent a year, although
in 1970 manufacturing accounted for only about 15 percent of Malaysia's
GDP.
Also West Malaysia,which includes about 85 percent of the country's
population, achieved a satisfactory rate of growth of production. However,
the terms of trade deterioration limited the overall growth in real income
to about 4.5 percent to 5 percent per annum. With one of the highest popula-
tion growth rates in Asia, West Malaysia achieved only a very modest increase
in real per capita incomes and consumption of about 1.5 percent per annum.
The government was well aware of the population problem and since 1964 has
been increasing its efforts to reduce the population growth rate. Due both
to the efforts of the National Family Planning Board and to a general decline
in fertility caused by a trend towards later marriages, the population growth
declined from about 3.3 percent in 1960 to about 2.5 percent in 1970. Never-
theless, unemployment is at present about 8 percent of the labor force and
a large number of workers, particularly in rural areas, are in low income jobs.



6.        In the last two years, export earnings have stagnated and there
has been a sharp decline in market prices for Malaysia's major export
products. The key agricultural exports were hit by a declining demand
with the value of rubber exports dropping as much as 50 percent between
the peak in mid-1969 and the trough in mid-1972 when rubber prices fell
to their lowest level since 1947. The GNP growth rate, adjusted for the terms
of trade deterioration, slowed down to 2 to 3 percent per annum.
7.        The medium-term outlook for Malaysia's economy, however, appears
favorable. The recovery in industrial countries in 1972 is increasing the
demand for, and the prices of, Malaysia's export proclucts and a sound anti-
cyclical budgetary policy which was started by government in 1971 is beginning
to bear fruit. Also the increase in private investment after the reestablish-
ment of confidence following the 1969 disturbances is assisting the recovery.
GNP and per capita GNP are forecast to grow at a real rate in 1973 of about
6 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.
8.        Since the racial disturbances of May 1969, Malaysia's political
structure has been stable and the ruling position of the Alliance Party
virtually unchallenged. However, the debate continues on the disparity
between the economic position of Malays and non-Malays. The search for
economic and social policies designed to reduce the economic differences
between the two main ethnic groups is the principal theme of the Second
Malaysia Plan for 1971-75 (SMP). The SMP centers on the New Economic Policy
which aims at eradicating poverty and restructuring society, so that the
present identification of race witU particular forms of economic activity
will eventually be eliminated.  Measures to implement the policy are
being developed. The SMP seeks continued rapid economic eypansion as
necessary to support redistribution of wealth and income.
9.        The Second Malaysia Plan reflected the government's option in favor
of a more vigorous role for the public sector in the country's development
efforts. The Plan proposed a minim-m actual disbursement target of US$2.4
billion representing a 38 percent increase over the actual development
expendituires during the First Plan (1966-70). Although implementation capacity
is still a proDlem in several areas, most government departments and agencies
have been .improving sigrificantly in this respect and expenditures during the
first two years of the Plar. period exceeded the original annual targets by
one-third. Government has therefore in connection with the forthcoming
mid-term Plan review raised the projected Plan appropriation of public sector
development expenditures to around US$3.25 billion. Anticipating a further
slrengthening cf project Identification and implementation in the public
sector the  e-ember 1972 economic mission believes that this increase is
still conservative and estimates that actual disbursements are likely to
reach the revised target easily. Most of the increased allocation is earmarked
for economic development, and a substantial portion is for transfers to institu-
tions for the implementation of the New Economic Policy in commerce and industry.
Allocations for agricultural development and the improvement of water supplies
have also been raised, partly reflecting higher project costs due to recent
price increases.



10.       With adequate external assistance, the financing of this large
increase appears feasible. Government revenues are satisfactory (federal
revenue accounted for 21.7 percent of GNP in 1972) and government can borrow
substantial amounts domestically in a non-inflationary way, especially from
the Employees Provident Fund. The higher expenditure level would require
net external public medium- and long-term loan capital inflows of about US$135
million a year during the 1971-75 period. In the past, the Bank has provided
about 40 percent of the public sector's external borrowing. Bilateral aid,
mainly from the U.K., other Commonwealth countries, and Germany accounted for
another 45 percent. Over the next five years, Japan is expected to become the
largest bilateral donor; a new Y36 billion credit line (US$140 million at the
current exchange rate) was signed in 1972. ADB is expected to continue expanding
its lending and also Bank lending is projected to increase in line with Malaysia's
total external borrowing. Debt service obligations at present are about 3 percent
of exports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated not to exceed
7-8 percent during the seventies.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
11.       The Bank has made 21 loans to Malaysia for projects in education,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, and urban transport. Although in a
few cases disbursements were slow the execution of these projects has
generally been satisfactory. As of March 31, 1973 the loans to Malaysia held
by the Bank amounted to US$324.8 million. In addition, the Bank made a loan
in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Ln No.405-MA), guaranteed
by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The amount due to the Bank
is US$5.5 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and
IFC investments as of March 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
12.       The central thrust of Bank assistance to Malaysia is to support
the government's efforts within the framework of the New Economic Policy to
redress imbalances in rural and urban incomes, to create employment for the
urban unemployed, and to reduce underemployment. Since Malaysia's land
development programs provide the most effective government policy for tackling
the issues of employment and income imbalance, the Bank will continue, even
more than in the past, to give financial support to these programs. In
addition, the Bank will continue to assist Malaysia in the critical field of
education and will finance a further expansion of essential infrastructure
to support a continuous and balanced growth in the economy.
13.       As pointed out above the capacity of most government departments
and agencies to execute investments has improved. Nevertheless, assistance
in project preparation and implementation will still be needed for some time.
The Bank has helped the government to prepare projects either in the course
of its lending operations or by acting as Executing Agency for UNDP-financed
studies. In the course of its lending operations, the Bank has also helped
strengthen public agencies responsible for carrying out important parts of
Malaysia's investment program. We will continue this policy which will
be reflected in the loans to be presented to you in the next year or
so. These loans would be for projects involving drainage, land settlement,



- 4 -
agricultural credit, agricultural research, road transport, electric power and
education. Our ability to assist should be further enhanced through our resident
staff in Bangkok, one of whose primary functions will be to identify and to prepare
projects initially in the agricultural and transport sectors of both Thailand
and Malaysia.
14.       As noted above, Bank lending in the next few years is expected to
increase in line with Malaysia's total external borrowing. Despite a
commendable savings effort, Malaysia's need for external capital exceeds
the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for financing from abroad.
Also, the foreign exchange content of projects in such sectors as education
and agriculture is typically small. For these reasons, the Bank will continue
to cover a portion of local costs in appropriate cases.
15.       IFC is not considering any new investment projects in Malaysia at
present.
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SERVICES IN MALAYSIA
16.       Water supply services have steadily been extended during the last
decade and an estimated 50 percent of the country's populatior of 11 million
is now being served with piped water. In West Malaysia, almost all urban
areas and adjoining villages as well as FELDA land settlement schemes are
being served with piped water supplies. Further, most o0f the water supply
systems within the states and in some instances water supply in adjacent states,
have been inter-connected to Tacilitate supply.   This approach has brought the
benefit of piped water supply to rural communities en route which would normally
be unable to support separate piped water systems on their own. In East
Malaysia, in general only the principal towns are being served. A few rural
pilot projects have recently started operations.
17.      Evxan¢3ion oi' wat.er supply is continuing under the Second Malaysia
Plans at the end of which an estimated 60 percent of the total population is
expected to be served.  Investment expenditLres for water supply schemes
comwencing during the Plan period are estimated at about US$80 million.
18.       itile progress ir, supplying safe water has been substantial, greater
prior:ity and support will have to be given to sewerage projects. At present
se>;erage systems exist onI3i in Kuala Lumpur, the capital, and Georgetown, the
state capitaJ. .d Penang. With the increase in water consumption and the
ezpa.ns i.or. oi the areas suppl ied with piped water, the waste water disposal
probt em is rapidly becoming serious. Pollution of the water sources is
alreaady occurring in many instances.  The S1{P, therefore, includes an allocation
of about US$tO million for sewerage schemes.
19.       The responsibility for providing water lies with each State Government
and, in general, their public works departuents are responsible for design,
operation and maintenance. Recently, however, the States of Malacca and Penang
have set up water boards to manage the water supply systems within their states.
Some small rural water supply systems in the States of Pahang and Kelantan are
operated and maintained by local councils. The water supply branch of the
Federal PWD provides technical advice to the Federal Government and the state



- 5 -
PWD's in West Malaysia. It collects statistical data, examines proposals for
water supply schemes and assists in design as well as in procurement of equip-
ment and materials. At present there is no agency at the federal level
responsible for the review and coordination of sewerage projects, but the
Ministry of Health is organizing a Public Health Engineering Division to
deal with environmental sanitation and water pollution control activities.
20.       The funds for investments in water supply facilities are derived from federal
government loans, budget allocations and state and local resources. International.
loans are sought only for the larger projects. Thus the ADB has lent a total
of US$18.3 million for water supply projects servicing Penang, Malacca and the
Greater Ipoh area, while the Bank has made a loan of US$3.6 million for a water
supply scheme in the State of Selangor (paragraph 22). Under the Second lMalaysia
Plan the State Governments which can afford it have been encouraged to use
mainly their own resources for water supply projects.
21.       The concept of beneficiaries paying for the provision of adequate
water is well established in Malaysia and the water rates are generally
sufficient to meet operating costs and debt service and to yield a small surplus.
Water revenues have steadily increased in all states. Billing and collection
procedures are satisfactory and collection, in general, is good.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
History
22.       In terms of overall performance, the State of Selangor ranks first
among the states of West Malaysia regarding water supply operations. The Bank
provided a loan of US$3.6 million equivalent in 1968 (Ln No.561-MA) to cover
the foreign exchange cost of the first stage of a development plan to provide
for the water needs of the Klang Valley region including Kuala Lumpur, the
capital of Malaysia. This project will be completed in June 1973 and includes
water treatment works with a capacity of about 14 million imperial gallons per
day (IMgd) which, with existing facilities, would cover the water needs of the
population in the project area up to 1976. The loan now being proposed would
contribute to the financing of the second stage of the same plan. The project
was prepared for the Water Division of the Selangor State Government by the
consultant firm of Binnie and Partners (Malaysia). The project was appraised
by the Bank in October/November 1972 and negotiations were held in April 1973
with a Malaysian delegation led by Mr. Sulaiman Abdullah, Deputy Director-General,
Economic Planning Unit. A Loan and Project Summary is included in Annex III. The
Appraisal Report No. 68a dated May 2, 1973 is being distributed separately.
Description
23.       The proposed project consists of the second stage of the long-range
development plan for water supply to the Klang Valley region of the State of
Selangor. It would consist of (a) the construction on the Langat River, 24
miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, of a dam (about 175 feet high) which would
regulate the river flow and permit a reliable offtake of about 85 IMgd through-
out the year, (b) the expansion of intake works financed under the first phase
from about 14 IMgd to about 42 IMgd, (c) the extension of the distribution



- 6 -
system including the installation of about L5 mi-les of watermains, the construc-
tion of service reservoirs and the provision of about 40,000 water meters, and
(d) consulting services.
24.       The present production of water in the project area is about 55 IMgd
and consumption is about 20 percent less because of leakages. About 850,000
people are served with piped water supply and their consumption is on average slightly
less than about 50 gallons per day per capita. Demand is expected to increase by
a_cou  6.5 percent per year.  With the facilities to be provided under the first and
second projects, the total production would be increased to about 97 IMgd. Since
unaccounted for water is expected to decrease in the next ten years to a reasonable
level of 15 percent of production because of increased detection efforts by
the Water Division, this production would be sufficient to cover the water
needs of the area up to 1.981.  The dam would permit further offtakes from the
river of about 43 IMgd so that eventually after further expansion of the
intake works, total production in the project area could be about 140 IMgd
which would cover the needs of the population up to 1988.
25.       The effect of abstracting a significant percentage of the flow of a
river on siltati'on and salinization downstream is always difficu.llt to predict.
However, under the proposed project the total offtake would be only about 42
flgd out of a total of 115 IMgd at low flow., and tlo probleis are expected. Further
offtakesi are planned for the period aifter 1981. for a maaxiijall additional quantity
of 43 IMgd wh-ich would however s-bIl allow about 30 IMgci to pass downstream.
Moreover, assurances have been given that the discharge of sewage effluent from
inlhaib.ted areas and industries into the Langat fliver would be controlled.
,.n;Leme n ta tiorn
26.       The ,Ja.ter D-.vision of the Selangor State Government would be
res'onsoblie for overall project administration and the consultants, Biimie
aid Partners (Miaclaysia), would be responsible for detailed design, preparation
of b-L.?di.n uo urente, v evaluation otf bids and construction supervision.  The
whoJe p      't ronr; desi-?- to commissioning is expected to be carried out during
the. 0e2 oci 19 (3 to 1997,

(;. ;o* '_'Le trtal cost of the project, net of duties, taxes and interes-ts,
is e. tLated .t ~iS$26.2 mi.llion of' which 49 percent or US$12.7 millioni would
be local. cost and 51 percent or US$13.5 million foreign exchange cost.  The
proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange costs, including the ex-factory
cost of locally manufactured equipment awarded after international competitive
bidding; the local costs would be financed by internal cash generated from
operations. The Bank loan would be made to the Malaysian Federal Government and
would be on-lent by the Federal Government to the Selangor State Government



- 7 -
on the same terms as those of the Bank loan, namely for twenty years including
a grace period of five years.
Procurement and Disbursement
28.       All construction and supply contracts are to be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding following the Bank's guidelines for
procurement. Local manufacturers are expected to compete successfullly for
the supply of pipes and water meters. A margin of preference to local
manufacturers of 15 percent or the customs duty, whichever is the lower,
would be given.
29.       The loan will be disbursed against the c.i.f. cost of all direct
imports, the estimated foreign exchange ccmponent of locally purchased goo's
and civil works contracts, ex-factory costs of locally manufactuired goods and
the foreign costs of ccnsultants' services. The schedule of disbursements is
shown in Annex III.
30.       It is proposed that the Bank reimburse the foreign exchange costs
of the consulting services incurred after January 1, 1973. The Selangor State
Government approved the appointment of Binnie and Partners (Malaysia) to carry
out this work in November 1972 in order that there should be no hold-up in the
supply of water. This retroactive financing would not exceed US$120,000.
Financial Rates of Return
31.       The financial position of the Water Division of the State of Selangor
is sound. The return on average net fixed assets in operation in 1971 averaged
9.2 percent for the operations in the project area and 6.1 percent for the
operations of the Water Division as a whole. Further, in 1971 only 44 percent
of long-term capitalization was outstanding in the form of debt, the remaining
56 percent represented equity made up of government participation and accumulated
surpluses. Operating income covered the debt service 2.86 times in 1971.
Projections show that with existing water charges the return on net fixed assets
in the project area would be at least 8 percent annually except for the years
1978 and 1979 when returns would be somewhat lower, between 6 and 8 percent,
because of the indivisibility of the works causing a time lag between sales and
investments. Also the statewide returns of the Water Division would be
satisfactory, although inevitably somewhat lower than in the project area. No
change in the water charges is therefore proposed. Assurances have been obtained
that the Water Division will maintain an annual return of at least 8
percent on net fixed assets in service in the project area except for the years
1978 and 1979 when the return should be at least 6 percent.
Economic Justification
32.       The rate of return of the project, calculated in accordance with the
internal rate of return method and based on revenues, is about 8.5 percent.
However, this return does not include public health and flood control benefits.
Moreover, the project is essential for the sound development of the Klang
Valley region. The economic rate of return is therefore substantially higher
than the financial rate of return.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.        The draft Loan Agreement between Malaysia and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the State of Selangor and the Bank, the report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approvig the proposed loan are
being diatributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements
conform to the pattern normally used by the Bank f'or water supply projects.
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION!/
In No. 434   Muda Irrigation Project;  US$45.O Million Loan of
November 17, 1965; Closing Date: June 30, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
about 260,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the States of
Kedah and Perlis. Physical works are now complete except for some minor
items and corrections. Targets for off-season cropping have been reached
during the first two years of operation and 170,000 acres are expected to
be double cropped this year. However initial delays in land acquisition
and execution of works required extensions of the original Closing Date of
June 30, 1970.
Ln No. 500   Kemubu Irrigation Project;  US$10.0 Million Loan of
June 15, 1967; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The project includes the construction of facilities to irrigate
47,000 acres of land for double cropping with paddy in the State of Kelantan.
Organization and activities of farm associations and cooperatives have progressed
as scheduled and supply of inputs and supporting services are satisfactory. Changes
in investment costs, production areas, estimated yields and prices prompted a re-
calculation of the economic rate of return. The new estimate is about 12% compared
with 13% during appraisal. Physical works are almost completed except for quaternary
canals a,ad 43,000 acres can now be supplied with irrigation water. However, land
preparation is about one year behind schedule. The original Closing Date was
June 30, 1972.
In No. 533   Jengka Trian le Project.;  US$14.0 Kill.Ion Loan of
April 17, 1965; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Ln No. 672   Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project;  US$13.0 Million
Loan of May 20, 1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Ln No. 685   Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$25.0 Million
Loan of March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1951
The projects consist of the clearing of forest, the planting of
62,000 acres of oil palms and 35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of
10,000 families in the Jengka Triangle (State of Pahang). Initial delays in
the land clearance and planting work due to lack of contractors' capacity have
been substantially overcome and implementation is now proceeding satisfactorily.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Ln No. 673   Jengka Forest Project;   US$6.5 Million Loan of
May 20, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
Implementation of the project, consisting of a highly complex
integrated forestry products industry established in the Jengka Triangle, has
suffered because of management and technical problems. which can both be traced
to the lack of previous experience of this kind in Malaysia. However, corrective
steps are being taken and performance is improving.
Ln No. 579   Fourth Power Project-   US$8.5 Million Loan of
January 9. 1969;   Closing Date:  March 31, 1974
Ln No. 700   FiftC Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July   , 1970; ClosingDate:JauaY 31, 1975
Implementation of the projects consisting of extensions to
existing thermal plants of the National Electricity Board system is behind
schedule, bec-iuse of manufacturers' delays, particularly in supplying
structural steels and turbo-alternators.   The Closing Date for JI.c o. 70.0
will probably have to be extended; the original Closi:ng Date f!or In No.579
was [arch 31, 1973,
Ln No. 560   Telecommunications Project;   US$a.4 Million Io sfu{
September 27, 1966;   Closing Date:  Septembe:- 30, 1973
in No. 753   Second Telecommu-nications Project; Us$161.7 Million Loan of
June 21 1971;   Closing Date:   June 3d, 1976
The projects include facilities and equipment to improve the
domestic and international telecormunications systems. After initial delays

and all but one should be completed by early 1974. A start on the con-t.ruction of

be invited by June 1973 but construction may not, be completed imtil April
1975, some 4 months after the Closing Date (December 31, 1974).   Tota. project,
