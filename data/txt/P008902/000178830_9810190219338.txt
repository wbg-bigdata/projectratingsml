INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED TENTH LOAN TO
TURKIYE SINAI KALKINMA BANKASI A. S.
WITH GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1 .       I submit the following Report and Recommendation of a proposed loan
to Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi A. S. (TSKB) with the Guarantee of the
Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$40 million to help finance lending
for industry and tourism. Amortization would conform substantially to the
aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment
projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan. The interest rate would
be 7.25% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Developments and Prospects of
Turkey" dated September 18, 1972 was distributed to the Executive Directors
on October 25, 1972 (R72-236). A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a long period of stability, internal political tensions
have appeared in the last two years. Student disturbances and unrest among
workers occurred in 1970 and early 1971, and the armed forces called in March
1971 for the resignation of the Demirel cabinet and for the implementation
of the land, tax, educational, administrative and other reforms prescribed by
the 1961 Constitution. An "above-party and reformist" government was formed
under Prime Minister Erim, and martial law was introduced. In its eight
months in office, the Government largely re- established law and order, and
introduced some administrative changes. It also raised prices charged by
several State Economic Enterprises and presented several reform bills to
Parliament. However, it was not able to translate its long-range economic
policies into detailed measures and decrees. Growing opposition from
Parliament to some of the administrative changes and reform proposals brought
about the resignation of a large group of ministers in December 1971, and a
new coalition government, headed again by Prime Minister Erim, was then formed.
The second Erim government had greater political party representation, but
its attempt to push through modified reform measures, again met with opposition
in Parliament. A mining reform bill and a moderate land reform bill were
introduced in Parliament, but little was done to further educational reform
or to reorganize the State Economic Enterprises. Prime Minister Erim resigned
in mid-April after his request for "government by decree", intended to speed
up the process of reforms, was turned down by the political parties. A new
government drawn from three parties and non-parliamentarians and headed by
Prime Minister Melen was formed in May 1972. It declared its aim to pursue
the reform measures and prepare for the national election in the fall of 1973.



-2-
4.        While long-term economic policy issues have recently become a
cause of political tensions, growth in Gross National Product in the last
decade has been high and continuous, averaging about 6.8 percent per year
in the period 1962-1971. In the same period, gross investment increased
substantially, with its share in GNP rising from 15 to 21 percent. Although
total consumption increased considerably, gross national savings increased
at a much faster rate, their share in GNP rising from 11 to 20 percent.
However, in the last two years, in spite of a big jump in workers' remittances,
the share of investment and gross national savings has not risen substantially
due to relatively poor public savings.
5.        The main growth sectors in the last decade have been industry, power
and construction. This reflected the development strategy during the first
and second five-year plans (1962-67, 1968-72), which gave highest priority
to industrialization. Industrial output grew bv about 10 percent per annum
with textiles, machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals providing the main
impetus. But this rapid growth, mainly to meet domestic demand and replace
imports, was insulated from foreign competition. Other rapidly growing sectors
were transport, trade and financial services. The impact of large investments
in agriculture was slow, however, and agricultural production had a trend
growth rate of about 3 percent per annum, with large fluctuations from year to
year depending on weather conditions. As a result of the relative growth rates,
the shares of industry and trade in GDP rose to 23 and 10 percent respectively,
and that of agriculture dropped to 27 percent. In 1971 GNP increased by 9 per-
cent in real terms, thanks largely to an excellent harvest, a continued indus-
trial growth and a sharp rise in emigrant worker remittances, and output in
1972 promises also to be above average.
6.        The balance of payments situation was characterized in 1967-70 by
increasing trade deficits, and a strict system of import controls leading to
delays and shortages of essential imports and, consequently, to underutiliza-
tion of production capacity. The overvalued official exchange rate was changed
in August 1970 (from TL 9 to TL 15 per US$) and revised to TL 14 in December
1971. This, together with associated stabilization measures and a rapid rise
in workers' remittances helped to improve the situation dramatically. Workers'
remittances increased sharply, from about $140 million in 1969 to $470 million
in 1971. Commodity exports and tourism receipts also increased markedly.
Net foreign assets, which were negative in 1966-68, rose to about $400 million
in June 1972, the equivalent of four months' imports. These improvements have
led to better availability of essential imports of investment goods, raw
materials and parts, and to rebuilding of stocks. The improvement in the
balance of payments has continued in 1972; in the first six months, exports
were 53 percent higher than in the corresponding period in 1971 due primarily
to increased exports of tobacco, cotton, textiles and food and beverages;
imports were 16 percent higher; and workers' renittances had already reached
$550 million by the end of September, compared with $470 million during the
whole of 1971. The overall result has been a substantial rise in gross
foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $1,134 million at the end of
September 1972.



- 3 -
7.        The budgetary situation has been dominated in the last decade by the
need to control the rapid growth of public expenditures. Tax revenues have
grown faster than GNP, their share rising from 12.9 percent in 1962 to 17.6
percent of GNP in 1971, but the increases in tax revenues have been more than
offset by the rise in current expenditures and transfers. The overall budget
deficit has grown since 1968 and was particularly large in 1971 when the full
impact on current expenditures of public salary increases under the 1970
Personnel Reform Law was felt. The Treasury had to have growing recourse to
the Central Bank for short-term advances and to other short-term borrowing.
The difficulties facing public mobilization of resources led to public invest-
ment expenditures falling short of targets, and to an actual decline in public
fixed investment in real terms in 1971. The pressure on public resources is
likely to continue in 1972, and the growth of public development expenditure
will probably suffer as a result.
8.        The financial results of the State Economic Enterprises (SEE's)
have been consistently poor. Although the SEE's now account for over 10
percent of the value added and about 20 percent of the fixed investment in
the economy, the rate of return on investment in the 28 major producing SEE's
as a whole has been less than 3 percent in the last few years. The low
profits of the SEE's have necessitated increasing budgetary transfers, which
amounted to TL 3.5 billion in 1971. The profitability varies among different
SEE's, with railways and the Coal Corporation, incurring heavy losses.
9.        In the period 1967-70, while available resources increased, a more
rapid growth of expenditures led to inflationary pressures in the economy,
resulting in an average increase in wholesale prices of about 6 percent per
annum. Inflationary pressure became particularly strong in 1971 when whole-
sale prices rose 16 percent and cost of living by 20 percent. The pressures
came mainly from the demand side due to substantial increases in public
salaries and industrial wages, higher remittances from abroad and larger
agricultural incomes in a year of record output.   At the same time controlled
prices of public industrial enterprises and support prices of major agricul-
tural products were also raised, and prices of imported goods increased sharp-
ly as a result of both devaluation and the rise in world export prices. The
pressure on prices has continued in 1972, fueled by a continued rise in
receipts from remittances and exports, as well as by the resumed growth of
investment, both private and public. Wholesale prices rose by 10.5 percent
in the first nine months of 1972. In these circumstances, better mobiliza-
tion of resources by the public sector, a balance between the claims of the
public and private sectors on investment funds, further liberalization of
imports and avoidance of short term borrowing by the Treasury from the Central
Bank are needed, among other measures, to contain the inflationary pressure.
10.       For the longer term, the continued political uncertainties have
meant that the planned reforms, e.g. administrative, tax, educational and
land reforms, and reorganization of SEE's have on the whole not progressed
very far. In July 1972, a "preliminary measures law" for land reform was
passed which provided for preparatory measures, but the land reform bill has



- 4 -
yet to be passed by Parliament. Administrative reform of the SEE's and
upgrading their executive and labor skills have still to be achieved. This
is particularly important to prepare Turkish industry for competition that
will arise from association with the EEC. In agriculture, although sub-
stantial irrigation investments have been made in the past and the government
rightly gives high priority to completing on-going projects, several long-term
problems remain. The Anatolian plateau and the eastern part of Turkey are
considerably less developed than the coastal regions and land tenure problems
are serious in some regions. Surplus stocks of tobacco, tea and hazelnuts
have accumulated and there is need to modify price support and other policies
to divert resources from these surplus crops. Some progress has already been
made in shifting land from sugarbeets to sunflower, feedgrains and other crops.
11.       The problem of domestic resource mobilization by the public sector
will remain a major constraint and will restrain the real growth of public
investment in the Third Plan period (1973-77), especially if the savings
strategy continues to be heavily dependent on public savings. The draft
Third Plan targets imply excessively high marginal savings rates. If sub-
stantial increases in public savings are to be realized, then planned changes
in the tax structure should be implemented at an early stage and the failure
of State Economic Enterprises to generate sufficient surpluses should be a
major concern of economic policy. In addition, it is essential to develop
a capital market in Turkey to supplement the existing sources of long-term
domestic borrowing. Proposals for a capital market bill are now being
considered.
12.       The employment situation is also a matter of growing concern.
Despite rapid industrialization and with the levelling off in agricultural
employment, Turkey has not been able to absorb the increasing labor supply in
the last decade. The labor force grew by about 420,000 a year between 1965
and 1970, of whom about 57,000 emigrated and 240,000 found employment on the
domestic market, mostly in services and industry, leaving about 124,000 more
unemployed each year. In the medium term, labor supply is expected to con-
tinue growing by about 2.8 percent per year while demand outside agriculture
is projected to about half the increase only. Speedy implementation of land
reform would help to reduce the migration from rural to urban areas. In
addition, labor-intensive projects need special emphasis in the choice of
industrial projects. However, even with continued emigration, urban unemploy-
ment is likely to grow.
13.       If the country remains politically stable and if the government
effectively carries out structural reforms in the areas mentioned above and
promotes exports, Turkey may be able to maintain or even exceed a growth
rate of 7 percent per annum. However, in spite of the recently improved
balance of payments and exchange reserve positions, Turkey will continue to
need substantial amounts of external assistance to be able to maintain a high
level of investment as well as meet its financial obligations. The growth
of foreign exchange reserves is unlikely to continue at the same rate, par-
ticularly as short-term debts are repaid. Reserves are also needed to
cushion any sudden drop in workers' remittances which are vulnerable to



-5-
changes in economic conditions in the host countries, and to support further
import liberalization. Larger project assistance will also be needed to
offset the decline in program assistance. In these circumstances, it would
seem advisable for Turkey to continue for the time being its restraint in
using suppliers' credits.
14.       Total debt outstanding and disbursed was $2.2 billion at the end
of 1971, of which all but 2 percent is public or publicly guaranteed. The
average terms have been hardening in recent years and this trend is expected
to continue. Of the total gross official external assistance of about $400
million in 1971, the Consortium members provided about $300 million. Of this,
about $90 million came from the United States, $52 million from the European
Fund, $26 million from the European Investment Bank and $37 million from the
World Bank Group. The USSR disbursed $40 million. As a result of successive
debt reschedulings and arrangements for debt relief together with substantially
increased workers' remittances, the debt service ratio fell considerably after
1965, reaching 19.4 percent of exports of goods and non factor services and
12.9 percent of total foreign exchange earnings (including workers' remittances)
in 1971. However, since the improvements in the balance of payments have oc-
curred relatively recently and are based to a considerable extent on external
factors, Turkey should continue to seek a part of its external aid on conces-
sionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
15.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficulties
before the 1970 stabilization program, and devaluation of the Turkish lira,
Bank lending was only intermittent. Since then, the rapid improvement in the
balance of payments and in creditworthiness stimulated by these actions has
made possible a large increase and a new continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which
in FY 1971 and FY 1972 amounted to $114 million and $173.3 million respectively.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of October 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
16.       Bank Group lending since 1970 has generally been aimed at assisting
Turkey in the following broad development tasks: (a) the continued build-up
of creditworthiness; (b) the external orientation and liberalization of the
economy to improve external and domestic competitiveness; (c) improved orien-
tation of public investments with a view to ensuring the efficiency of invest-
ments and bringing about a better balance between growth and employment and
between the sectors and regions where development has reached a momentum of
its own and those where it is lagging and (d) institution-building in the
public sector and especially among SEE's, where resource mobilization should
and can be greatly improved.



- 6 -
17.       In the pursuit of these aims, a pattern of concentration in lending
is evolving along sector and to some extent along geographic lines. In two
sectors, agriculture and industry (including mining and development finance
companies), past and planned lending is on a large scale and fairly broad
in coverage of subsectors. In transportation, power and urban development,
substantial lending focused on a few projects, particularly SEE's, will be
continued or started. Geographical concentration has been designed to obtain
mutually reinforcing benefits in related sectors and institutions and to
support the objective of better rural-urban balance. Thus far, concentration
has occurred mainly in the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urban develop-
ment and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova region around Adana on the
southern coast, with emphasis on power, irrigation and fruit and vegetables.
A start has recently also been made on a complementary effort to provide
rural inhabitants with an alternative to urban migration by lending for
employment - creating projects such as the Second Livestock Credit wnich
focuses on breeding, raising and fattening in Eastern and Central Turkey
and by preparing, with the assistance of the IBRD/FAO cooperative program,
an integrated rural development project in rainfed areas of Central Turkey.
18.       Several specific projects financed by the Bank Group in recent years
or presently under discussion may be mentioned to illustrate the effort to
support the objectives discussed above.   For instance, emphasis was placed
on export-oriented sub-projects in the last loan (713-TU) made to the
Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) which has made a start in this
direction, and in the loan and credit (762/257-TU) for the Fruit and Vegetable
Export Project. Other projects for which lending is contemplated in coming
years, especially for livestock, forestry and irrigation, are expected to
enhance Turkey's ability to earn foreign exchange as well as spread development
in rural areas. On the other hand, attempts to assist the expansion of tourism
have not borne fruit, indicating some Government hesitation as to the importance
to be given to tourism in Turkey's development strategy; as a result tourism
projects suitable for Bank consideration have not yet been put in shape, al-
though an IFC investment in the sector is likely to be presented soon to the
Executive Directors. The objective of institution building has been pursued
chiefly in agriculture (including agricultural credit), power and in trans-
portation where a recently negotiated loan for railways is expected to pave
the way for substantial organizational and financial improvements. In pre-
paration of this, the Bank has already acted as executing agency for UNDP
technical assistance studies on transport coordination and on a railway
investment program. The Bank has furthermore been instrumental in bringing
about a comprehensive reorganization of the power sector culminating in the
establishment of the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) to which a loan
(763-TU) was made in 1971.
19.       In addition to the proposed Loan for TSKB, three other Bank/IDA
operations are planned for FY 1973: a $47 mil.ion loan to help finance a
project for the financial rehabilitation a-nd the technical and administrative
modernization of the railways; a loan of about $10 million for power develop-
ment as part of Istanbul's urban development; and a $44 million loan and $30
million credit for the irrigation multipurpose and power Ceyhan Aslantas
project.



-7-
20.       IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in industrial
investments in nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass and aluminum. Total commit-
ments so far amount to about $30 million. IFC is currently investigating new
investment opportunities in various sectors including special steel and
tourism.
PART III - INDUSTRY IN TURKEY
21.       Turkish manufacturing output grew by about 10 percent per year in
the 1960's with industries like machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals
providing much of the impetus for growth, and others like aluminium, motor
vehicles, durable consumer goods, synthetic fibres and major chemical inter-
mediates contributing to the sophistication and diversity of the sector.
However, industrial expansion was largely oriented towards import substitu-
tion, which was developed behind high tariff barriers and quantitative re-
strictions even when competitive cost production was not possible. In 1970,
industrial growth slowed down sharply to 2 percent, mainly due to shortages
of foreign exchange, leading to curtailed imports of raw materials and spare
parts, which resulted in under-utilization of industrial capacity. With the
devaluation in August, 1970, and the clearing of the backlog of import ap-
plications, industrial growth recovered in 1971, showing an increase of 10
percent.
22.       Manufacturing industry, mining and power, contributed in 1972 about
23 percent of GDP and employed about 10 percent of the active labor force.
Manufacturing accounts for about 86 percent of the value added in the sector.
Although modern industries have developed fast and represent now about 50
percent of the value added in manufacturing, traditional consumer goods in-
dustries are still very important with food, beverages and tobacco processing
accounting for about 25 percent of value added and textile and clothing about
20 percent. Exports still represent only a small part (2-3 percent) of the
value of manufacturing production, but they have increased at an average an-
nual rate of nearly 16 percent during the last four years, reaching $145 mil-
lion in 1971. Apart from processed foods, exports of manufactures consist
essentially of textiles (mainly cotton yarns), leather, wood products and
chemicals (pharmaceuticals, oils, borax and boric acid).
23.       Mining, which accounts for 8 percent of value added in the sector
and belongs mostly to the public sector, has grown comparatively more slowly
than manufacturing. Despite high investments, due to delays in starting new
projects, value added increased by only 4 percent per annum in recent years.
Production of basic minerals for domestic use, except lignite, has shown little
growth recently, with the production of coal, iron ore and crude oil being
stagnant for the last three years. On the other hand, production of minerals
for export has grown rapidly, with mineral exports increasing from $20 million
in 1967 to $40 million in 1971.



-8-
24.       The main problems in industrial development in the past have been
shortages of imported raw materials and spare parts resulting in underutil-
ization of capacity, which, together with the uneconomic size of plants, has
led to uncompetitive costs of production; in addition, the sector has suffered
from shortage of skilled labor and insufficient: emphasis on labor-intensive
industries and industrial development in less developed regions. With the
easier foreign exchange position and a more liberal policy towards imports,
capacity utilization should improve. The importance of minimum economic
plant size is now well appreciated by Turkish planners who aim at larger
plants and rely on exports to absorb the surplus over domestic demand. On
the other hand, the shortage of skilled labor is aggravated by the migration
of workers to Europe and the supply of skilled managers is surpassed by the
rapid expansion of industry. In the public sector in particular, competent
cadres tend to shift to the private sector due to higher salaries. Greater
emphasis on labor-intensive industries is required because they are poten-
tially more competitive in view of the prevailing wage structure and can help
in solving the problems of unemployment and regional imbalances.
25.       The First and Second Five Year Plans aimed at rapid industrializa-
tion as the basis for sustained economic growth, to absorb surplus manpower
and to reduce the need for foreign aid. The investment priorities in the
Second Plan were chemicals and petroleum refining, steel and other metals,
mechanical and electrical equipment and consumer goods. In the draft Third
Plan, the emphasis on industrialization is continued, with a comparatively
greater emphasis on investment goods. The long, term aim is to reach a highly
diversified industrial sector before full association with the EEC is achieved
in 1992.
26.       About 40 percent of the value added in manufacturing industry and
about 80 percent in mining comes from the public sector. The public sector
has a virtual monopoly in steel, petroleum refining, fertilizers, petro-
chemicals, pulp and paper. It has also accounted for about 57 percent of
industrial investment during 1967-71. Although some state economic enter-
prises have shown good operational results, the overall financial performance
has been poor. In the private sector, high rates of protection coupled with
investment incentives have encouraged investments in industry, particularly
in food, textiles, chemicals, cement, non-metallic products, metals, machin-
ery and vehicles. In 1971, private fixed investment in manufacturing rep-
resented 53 percent of the total. With the incentives announced in early
1972 for duty-free imports of investment goods and general prospects of
sustained growth, business confidence seems to be high and the prospects
for private investment in 1972 seem to be good.
27.       Of the total private fixed investment in manufacturing of TL 12
billion in the 1969-71 period, about 65 percent was financed by internally
generated funds of the companies and new share capital, 10 percent from tax
credits, five percent from bond issues and the remaining 20 percent from fi-
nancial institutions including the Industrial Development Bank (TSKB). TSKB's
disbursements during the period amounted to $85.7 million, corresponding to
about eight percent of the total investment.



- 9-
28.       The capital market in Turkey is extremely limited with a stock
exchange only in Istanbul. There are few negotiable securities available
for investors and fewer still which represent means for private industry to
raise funds through intermediary channels. There is a market for Government
bonds, confined largely to social security organizations and financial insti-
tutions, which are required to hold them. Until 1967 when TSKB started to
guarantee such issues, there were no bonds issued by private enterprises. It
is widely recognized that to mobilize long term capital the capital market
should be developed and a capital market bill is currently being considered.
However, the evolution of such a market can only be gradual.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Turkiye Sinai Kalkinma Bankasi,
A.S., Turkey"(15a-TU dated December 7, 1972) is being circulated separately.
A loan and project Summary is attached as Annex III.
30.       General.  The relationship between TSKB and the Bank spans more
than twenty-two years, originating with the founding of TSKB in 1950. TSKB
was the first development bank established with the assistance of the Bank
and it was one of the first clients of IFC. TSKB has grown with the Turkish
economy, its net worth, originally TL 12.5 million reached TL 271 million
($19 million) on June 30, 1972. Between its founding and September 30, 1972,
TSKB had raised about TL 3,700 million ($260 million) for Turkish industry,
of which $200 million was in foreign exchange. Five Bank Loans and four
IDA Credits contributed $128 million or 64 percent of this foreign exchange.
31.       TSKB continues to be the major institutional source of long term
finance for private industry in Turkey. The other main source is Sinai
Yatirim ve Kredi Bankasi A.S. (SYKB) founded in 1963 by six major commercial
banks. It is about one-third the size of TSKB, but while TSKB has been a
main source of long-term foreign exchange financing in Turkey, the bulk of
SYKB's lending to industry has been in local currency. In early 1972 the
Central Bank began to require commercial banks to allocate every year ten
percent of their total commercial credits to medium term loans; some of these
funds may be invested either through or with the assistance of TSKB.
32.       TSKB's lending reflects the pattern of private industry in Turkey
and is well diversified. After a slowdown in commitments, due to the un-
certainties besetting the private sector in the periods preceding the August
1970 devaluation and stabilization program, and following the March 1971
change in Government, TSKB experienced an upsurge in early 1972 and looks for
a substantial increase in its lending in the coming two years.
33.       Since the previous Bank loan of $40 million in 1970, TSKB on the
Bank's urging, has increased considerably the geographical dispersion of in-
vestments previously concentrated in the Marmara Sea region; in 1971, 46 per-
cent of TSKB's lending was outside this area. TSKB is also planning to become



- 10 -
more active in Eastern Turkey where private industry has so far not develo. !c,
despite an adequate natural resource base and where both investors and. -
nancial institutions need to be encouraged.    A similar situation prevails
for tourism which, despite Turkey's great potential based on natural anrd
historic assets, is growing much more slowly than in other mediterranean
countries; TSKB is now planning to start lending for tourism. At the time
of the previous Bank loan to TSKB, concern was expressed over the small num-
ber of export-oriented projects financed by TSKB and the large number o0
small loans to relatively large companies for essentially replacement needs;
the situation is now markedly improved in both respects.
34.       On the whole, TSKB is an efficient development finance company
which has no internal problems affecting its long-established good standing
as a borrower of Bank funds. Its competent appraisal staff gives balanced
consideration to both the financial and economic aspects of projects. The
key challenges in TSKB's immediate future are the raising of enough domest.
and foreign resources to meet the expanding needs of Turkish private indust---,
the further geographical diversification of its lending and the extension e
lending to tourism projects.
35.       Capital Structure and Resources.    TSKB's unaudited June 30, 1972
balance sheet shows total assets of TL 2,207 million ($158 million) includ-
ing TL 1,346 million ($93 million) in foreign currency debt. Of total as-
sets, the loan portfolio represents 80 percent, the equity portfolio 6 per-
cent and liquid funds 7 percent. Of liabilities, 62 percent of the total
comes from foreign loans, 26 percent from local borrowings and 12 percent
from equity. The Government is the primary source of local funds, having
provided TL 368 million or 17 percent of total assets in a subordinated
loan. Share capital is privately owned; 81 Turkish shareholders own 76 per-
cent of the shares, another 13 percent is foreign owned with IFC the largest
foreign shareholder. The ownership is broadly representative of the Turkish
financial community: the major commercial bank, Turkiye Is Bankasi, is the
largest shareholder holding 20.8 percent of the shares and 11 other Turkish
private institutions own an additional 42.5 percent. Besides the IBRD, which
accounts for 36 percent of TSKB's debt, foreign funds have been provided bv
the European Investment Bank, which holds 16 percent,Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (7 percent), and USAID (3 percent).
36.       Management and Organization.   TSKB's management and staff are
capable and experienced; the staff totals 224, including 104 professionals.
Following the resignation in 1971 of Mr. Yazici, TSKB's Managing Director,
Mr. Egeli became TSKB's Chief Executive. Mr. Egeli has been associated with
TSKB since its founding.   In January 1971 TSKB i?.-roved its organization,
integrating the various aspects of the appraisal work previously done inde-
pendently. TSKB's technical staff have the expertise and experience to assist
project sponsors to revise and improve proposed projects and have done so in
many cases. TSKB's Board of Directors consists of 9 members, all Turkish.
Mr. Ferid Basmaci, General Manager of Turkiya Is Bankasi, has been Chairman
of the Board since 1969, and there have been but two changes in the Board
composition since the last Bank loan. The Board is active; it meets twice



- 11 -
a month and considers all applications above US$50,000 equivalent. The Board
in the past has been conservative and was not always ready to take the rislks
implied by a more aggressive developmental orientation. There are indications
that this posture is changing and that TSKB's Board is becoming more aware
than before of TSKB's development role in Turkey's backward regions. Thus
TSKB's Regional Development and Promotion Department has been working since
1971 on a systematic promotion program in Anatolia; it has identified about
20 new industrial projects and is seeking sponsors and investors for them.
A mature and sound institution, TSKB can play a larger role in promoting de-
velopment in Turkey and the Bank has encouraged TSKB to make more moves in
this direction.
37.       Role and Importance.   Undoubtedly TSKB's major contribution in
Turkey has been to serve as a vehicle through which funds could be channeled
to Turkish industry on the basis of a particularly well developed appraisal
process. Currently over 700 individual companies have received TSKB's as-
sistance and the number of projects reviewed over its 22-year history is
several times greater. TSKB has made a significant contribution in Turkey in
terms of project selection and its overall performance, including periods
of recession as well as expansion, has been commendable.
38.       Operating Policies and Procedures.   Until its recent decision to
finance tourism,TSKB's activities were devoted exclusively to industry, fol-
lowing policy guidelines last revised in 1967. These guidelines provide limits
for exposure in its loans and investments, restrict the use of foreign exchange
to imports, and provide for economic tests of the merits of projects. Since
1968, TSKB has been making an explicit assessment of the economic impact of its
projects and since 1970 it has been employing effective rate of protection
calculations. Despite a number of protective and incentive features in Turkey,
TSKB's projects have only rarely shown an effective rate of protection exceed-
ing 15 percent. In general, as the increased geographical dispersion of its
investments, promotion activities, exploration of tourism and emphasis on
economic analysis demonstrate, TSKB is moving towards a more active devel-
opmental role than heretofore.
39.       Financial Results.   Both foreign currency and lira loans are lent
at the maximum legal rate of 12 percent net after a 25% tax, which means that
after tax TSKB's borrowers pay 15 percent. Borrowers also assume the foreign
exchange risk on foreign currency loans. Average terms are about 6-7 years
on lira loans and 9-12 years on foreign currency loans. Following the 1970
devaluation, arrears on TSKB's loans increased sharply because of liquidity
difficulties faced by borrowers; loans affected by arrears in excess of three
months totaled TL 240.7 million on December 31, 1970, about 15 percent of the
loan portfolio, and the payments in arrears totalled TL 48.9 million. In
spite of intensive efforts at collection, arrears in excess of three months
have increased to TL 77.7 million as of June 30, 1972, although the percentage
of the portfolio affected has dropped to 10.3 percent. However, TSKB's port-
folio is considered sound as loans in arrears are well covered by collateral
and provisions for losses are adequate. Profits are good; they reached 18
percent of net worth after taxes and provisions for losses in 1971 and TSKB



- 12 -
has maintained its historical 12 percent dividend involving in 1971 a 38 per-
cent distribution of earnings. The yield on market prices is a nominally low
7 percent but average yields over time are estimat:ed around 12 percent due
to bonus shares and rights issues.
40.       Projected Operations and Resources Required.   Supported by an ex-
panding economy but also by TSKB's determination to play a wider role in
backward regions and tourism, TSKB expects its total commitments to triple
in the next five years, reaching a total of TL 8.6 billion ($ 615 million)
for the 1973-1977 period. To support this increase TSKB will need to borrow
in the next two years alone $118 million in foreign exchange and TL 650
million ($46 million) in lira. TSKB expects to obtain foreign exchange
loans aggregating $45 million equivalent from EIB and KfW. The Government
has also agreed to permit TSKB for the first time to raise foreign resources
from private financial institutions abroad on conventional terms. IFC is
assisting TSKB in borrowing in foreign capital markets where there are good
prospects for raising substantial amounts over the next two years. Together,
these sources will not cover the foreign exchange requirements in their
entirety; a Bank Loan of $40 million will help TSKB bridge its foreign exchange
resource gap for about 2 years, but at the same time leave enough uncovered
to induce it to continue its active search for funds from other sources.
Moreover, if the above efforts are successful TSKB's reliance on the Bank will
be further reduced: The Bank share of foreign exchange financing in the up-
coming two years would be but 34 percent of the foreign funds supplied as
compared with its 57 percent share of the foreign funds liabilities outstand-
ing in the June 30, 1972 balance sheet and its 64 percent share of TSKB's
foreign exchange borrowings since it was formed.
41.       TSKB's lira funds have come   thus far, although in increasingly
insufficient amounts, from TSKB's share capital and internal cash generation,
from quasi-equity and other loans provided by the Government and from
counterpart funds of foreign lenders (AID and EIB). The major obstacle
TSKB faces in tapping the domestic market is a 12 percent ceiling set by the
Government on the net lending rate for lira loans, which is below the current
effective cost of medium- and long-term funds in Turkey (at least 15 percent
for TSKB's borrowers and prime borrowers). Under these conditions, lira
borrowing produces a negative spread for TSKB. One possible solution to
enable TSKB to increase its local resources would be to raise its before tax
lending rate on lira funds from 12 percent to about 15 percent.   The waiving
of the expenditure tax for interbank lending (25 percent) would further ex-
pand TSKB's ability to mobilize funds and to relend them at a competitive
rate.  Both these measures would require a Government decision which cannot
be taken in isolation from the package of incentives the Government extends
to industrial investments, nor without a study of the other adjustments in the
Turkish interest rate structure which they may make necessary. While this
matter has been discussed with Government, an early decision before the impact
of the changes on the rate structure and the capital market have been tho-
roughly studied cannot be expected.



- 13 -
42.       Spread on Relending Borrowed Funds.   Under current market condi-
tions in Turkey, TSKB will relend Bank funds at 12%, resulting in a positive
spread of as much as 4.75%, although since interest rates on foreign exchange
loans are under pressure in Turkey, rates may well drop below the present
level before TSKB has fully committed the proposed loan. TSKB also needs
lira funds. As explained in paragraph 41 above, lira funds borrowed in the
market would cost TSKB about 15%, but since the interest received on their
relending would be only 12%, there would be a negative spread of about 3%.
In these circumstances, TSKB has agreed to the principle of a blend of the
foreign exchange borrowing from the Bank with lira borrowing from the local
market over the next two years, the local borrowing to take the form of direct
borrowing by TSKB of TL 200 million and TL 150 million in guarantees. More-
over, TSKB has undertaken to set aside not less than the equivalent of 25%
of the difference between the interest and commitment charge paid on the Bank
loan and the interest and commitment charge received from relending to be
used under a special program for the promotion of industrial (including small
and medium projects) and tourism enterprises, especially in the less developed
areas of Turkey. As a result of these arrangements TSKB's net spread will be
in the range of 2 to 2.5 percent.
43.       Financial Covenants.   The proposed loan will have the usual terms
for DFC operations including the standard commitment charge. In view
of TSKB's upgrading of its project appraisal work, an increase in the free
limit from $750,000 to $1 million is called for, with an aggregate free
limit of $12 million. The debt/equity ratio (calculated using the definition
in the Loan Agreement which treats the maturities on the subordinated Govern-
ment loans exceeding the last maturity on the latest Bank loan as equity) is
currently 3.0:1 as against the 4:1 maximum in the previous loan agreement.
Share capital, TL 124 million as of June 30, 1972 is being increased to TL
193.4 million. By the end of the year when the new shares issued will have
been fully paid up, TSKB's debt ratio will temporarily drop. However,
because of its projected increase in volume, TSKB's debt/equity limit will
exceed the present contractual limit of 4.0 to 1 sometime in 1973. Since
the quality of TSKB's portfolio is sound and covered by good guarantees,
with losses adequately provided for and its follow-up commendable; it is
proposed that the present debt equity limit be increased to 5 to 1. Such a
limit would require TSKB to add another TL 100 million to its net worth by
1975, which TSKB intends to do by increasing its share capital.
44.       Economic Benefits.   In 1971 68 percent of TSKB's loans were extended
to new companies or to existing clients for making new products, compared
with 46 percent in 1970; 29 percent were for financing export oriented proj-
ects. In the past three years an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 new jobs have been
created each year by the projects financed by TSKB at an estimated capital
investment of $15,000-20,000 equivalent per job. The Bank currently is under-
taking with TSKB a special study of the developmental impact of TSKB's oper-
ations.
45.       Capital Market Activities.   TSKB initiated private industrial-bond
markets in Turkey in 1967 when it began to guarantee such issues. By
September 1972 a total of 78 issues worth TL 922 million had been fLoated



- 14 -
of which 17 percent were guaranteed by TSKB. Because most corporations
are closely held family concerns, share issues by private corporations to
outsiders in Turkey are very limited in number. In addition, information
on firms is often inadequate. As a result the stock exchange in Istanbul
plays a relatively insignificant role in raising local capital. In the face
of these difficulties, TSKB has attempted to expand its direct investments
but as of June 30, 1971 its equity portfolio consisted only of the shares of
31 firms at a cost of TL 133.5 million. TSKB's equity portfolio is thus only
one-half of its net worth. In future, TSKB intends to intensify its efforts
to promote equity investments and to raise its limit on equity investments
from the present fixed level of TL 175 million to a limit based on a percent-
age of net worth.
46.       In summary, TSKB is an effective and important institution in
Turkey, contributing substantially to the growth of the industrial sector.
It has demonstrated its ability to use capital effectively and it is credit-
worthy for the additional Bank financing proposed.

C.        PRJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 59-TU Second Cukurova Power
This credit was fully disbursed before the revised closing date of
December 31, 1972. A major delay occurred during the early stages of the
project as a result of design modifications to the hydro plant brought
about by physical factors discovered at the site. Further delays were
encountered when the main contractor for civil works abandoned the
contract because of these geological problems. The resulting dispute
was settled through arbitration and the 'work finally completed by another
contractor.
Loan No. 568-TU Keban Transmission Lines
Progress on this project was interrupted for about a year in 1970/71 by
a dispute between the Turkish Electricity Akuthority (TEK) and the
principal contractor concerning payment of the increased cost of the
project, following the devaluation of the Turkish lira. This matter
has been put to arbitration and TEK is now carrying out constraction
using its own staff.  Subseauertly, delays on delivery dates for project
equipment led to postponement of the original closing date for the
loan to March 31, 1973. Since the earliest date for power operation
(two units) of the Keban dam has also been postponed, to May 1974, the
timing for the completion of the project is acceptable.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
loan and Credit Nos. 587/143-TU Seyhan Irrigation - Stage II
This project continues to make satisfactory progress. Yields of wheat
and seed cotton, the principal crops, reached record levels in the 1970/71
season.  Preliminary results both for this project and the earlier Seyhan
Stage I project (Loan and Credit 38/68-PU) show that yields are likely to
be maintained in the current season.
Loan No. 623-TU Third Cukurova Power
Work on this project is progressing well. Initial operation is scheduled
for July 1973, three months ahead of contract date for completion.
Credit No. 236-TU Livestock I
Tmplementation of this project was delayed initally by difficulties
encountered by the 'Turkish authorities in fulfilling some of the effecti-
veness conditions under the Credit Agreement and by administrative
problems in hiring the necessary staff for the project unit. These delays
were largely due to the absence, following a reorganization of the Turkish
Government administration in M4arch 1971, of an effective coordinating link
between the various ministries concerned with the project and between the
Government and the Bank Group. Steps have been taken recently to correct
this deficiency and progress on the project is now satisfactory.
Loan No. 748-TU Education
Following a slow start caused rmainly by the transfer of responsibility
for this project within the Turkish Government and indecision on the
selection of building sites, progress of civil works is about C3 months
behind schedule and equipment and furniture procurerne-t Crolt 4L months
behind schedule.  Ciiil works are limited to a Management Institute and
s-x adult centers.  The cost of civil wrorks is expected to be about the
same as that of the appraisal mission estimate except possibly for the
management institute, whose size and standards of equipment may be changed.
An estimata of the costs involved awaits review by the Bank.
Loan and Credit Nos. 762/257-TU Fruit and Vegetable
This project was also delayed by difficulties in meeting some of the
effectiveness conditions by the due date for the reasons noted under
236-TU above. Although it is expected that the project should catch up
on the time lost, the Agricultural Credit Survey, which is included for
financing under the project, will be delayed beyond the forecast date. 'he
Survey team has now been assembled, however, and is expected to produce a
preliminary report in March 1973 and a full report in September 1973,
which could permit Bank consideration of a first Agricultural Credit
project for FY 1975.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of h
Loan No. 763-TU TEK Fbwer Transmission
Implementation of this project was delayed by three months by failure to
meet effectiveness conditions when due. First contracts were awarded early
in 1972 and work is now progressing according to the revised schedule.
Loan No. 775-TU Fourth Cukurova Power
Tn part an extension of 623-TU, this project is still in the initial stage.
Major contracts have been awarded and work is proceeding on schedule. Esti-
mated combined foreign exchange cost of the Third and Fourth Cukurova projects
has increased by about $1,000000 principally due to currency exchange varia-
tions.  Cukurova is producing new cost estimates for Bank review.
Credit No. 281-TU Irrigation Rehabilitation
Preparation of specification and bidding documents and the respective work
programs of the Government agencies responsible for project implementation
are in hand to enable work to commence on schedule in 1973. Appointment of
consultants for on-farm development is taking longer than expected blit
should not hinder progress.
Loan No. 817-TU Steel Mill Expansion
Difficulties in coordinating the implementation of the project by
the Company, the donors (IBRDJ USAID and U.S. Ex-Im Bank) and the project
engineer (Koppers Associates Inc) have caused delay in the prequalification
of contractors and preparation of specification and bidding documents.
Credit No. 324-TU Istanbul Urban Development
The terminal date for effectiveness for this credit was postponed until
january 5, 1973 to permit completion of the required actions for effecti-
veness under 844-TU, Istanbul Water Supply, to which effectiveness of this
project is linked, There has been considerable progress towards the
selection of consultants although imnlementation will be delayed slightly
due -to the complexity of the arrangements necessary.
Credit No. 330-TU Livestock II
The signing of the Credit Agreement was delayed until September 1972 pending
the Third IDA replenishment.  Steps are being taken by the Turkish authorities
to implement conditions of effectiveness by the due date.
Loaan No. 844-TU Istanbul Water Supply
T'he ternminal date for effectiveness for this loan was postponed until
January 5, 1973, to permit completion of the re(quired steps. Considerable
progress has been made in the selection of the consultants and some of the
works are in progress. The new effectiveness date should be met on time.
Loan No. 845-TU IGSAS
This project was declared effective on October 6, 1972. Progress is on
schedule.
