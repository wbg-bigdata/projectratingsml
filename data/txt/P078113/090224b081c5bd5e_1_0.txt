                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project is expected to close on August 31, 2013. The overall achievements of the project at this time is moderately satisfactory. This is primarily due to the fact that some of the
                         PDO level indicators may not reach the end targets as designed. However, the new government statistics will be available by the time of the ICR and therefore, it is possible that the
                         PDO indicators will be met. Many of the project outputs have also been achieved. This can be seen by the fact that: (i) the teacher training project activities have been successful

                         completed with 503 teachers completing the 16 weeks upgrading program over 2 years during vacation; (ii) all the expect procurement of text-books has been completed; (iii) the
                         student assessment activities conducted nuder the EDPII were completed; (iv) activities under the strengthening policy and strategy development sub-component were implemented
                         as design; (v) the information system has been strengthened to the extent that annual yearbooks are being produced; and (vi) the tracking study of National University of Lao
                         graduates has been completed with the first intake of Education Administration and Management Division students. The two rounds of the community grants were delivered to 283
                         schools, however, it has not been possible to deliver the third round due to the initial delays in implementation. The Community-Based Contracting for School Construction (CBC) has
                         also made steady progress. There are 262 schools out of the original 291 schools that are completed and fully operational. Twenty-nine schools out of this group are still under
                         construction and expected to be completed by August 31, 2013. There were 47 additional schools added at the request for reallocating fund of the government which began
                         construction in March 2013. The government expects these school to be completed in July 2013. However, it may be difficult to fully complete the construction of the 47 schools prior
                         the rainy season.
