MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
Of THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
INDIA
FOR THE NATIONAL CAPITAL POWER SUPPLY PROJECT - PHASE I
1.      The following report on a proposed loan to India for US$485 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would be at the standard IBRD
rate of interest and would be repayable over 20 years including 5 years
grace. It would help finance a power project located near the National
Capital, New Delhi.
2.      Background.  In the 1950's and 1960's power development in India was
focussed almost entirely on the states, with each state striving for self
sufficiency. Consequently, power stations were not located optimally and
they generally failed to capture economies of scale. In the 1970's GOI
changed the thrust of power policy to focus on least cost regional develop-
ment, emphasising construction of power stations close to indigenous energy
resources. In the Northern Region developments have been concentrated on
mine-mouth coal-fired plants in the east of Uttar Pradesh and on hydro
schemes in the far north of the Region. Both areas are remote from the very
rapidly growing load center of the Capital, Delhi.
3.      While this regional focus has been supported b; the Bank and has
reduced costs, it has two limitations. Firstly, transmission development has
not always kept pace with generation. A number of Bank financed projects,
e.g. the Rihand Power Transmission Project, have been designed to strengthen
interstate transmission ties. Secondly, even where transmission capacity is
adequate, acute overall shortages of power mean that areas with propor-
tionately less generation fare badly. Under these circumstances the only
feasible way to maintain an adequate power supply to Delhi is to build more
capacity in the area.
4.      Until recently Delhi has had to rely primarily on the Indraprastha
and Badarpur power stations. Both have suffered from inadequate maintenance,
at least in part due to shortages of power and, although environmental con-
cerns were limited when they were built, both now represent unacceptable
sources of pollution. GOI's short term response to this critical power
supply position has been to sanction the installation of 6x30 MW combustion
turbines. As extended use of these seems likely, there is a strong a priori
case for retrofitting them with waste heat recovery boilers and steam tur-
bogenerators. In the longer term least cost development requires the estab-
lishment of a conventional coal fired plant.  The station at Dadri included
in the proposed Project is designed to fulfill this role.
5.      In addition to the above physical limitations on the supply of power,
the complex administration of the Union Territory of Delhi has restricted
DESU's autonomy and hindered its efficient operation. Concurrently, inade-
quate funding and excessive tariff restraint have constrained DESU's ability
to develop its transmission and distribution networks. System development



-2-
has been dictated by the availability of resources and the immediate needs of
consumers. Priority has consistently been given to expansion at the cost of
reinforcement and rehabilitation. As a result, system losses have increased
to 22Z, about twice the level experienced in similar but property maintained
networks. A 40% tariff increase in April 1985 raised DESU's average tariff
above that of most State Electricity Boards. However, despite this increase,
DESU has not been able to cover its costs owing to: the high costs of power
station operation and power purchases; high system losses; and the burden of
interest on accumulated debt. Solution of the problems of power supply to
the Capital requires a restructuring of DESU's finances to free it from the
legacy of inappropriate past policies and a program to improve power supply
facilities coupled with comprehensive streamlining of DESU's operations.
6.      Project Objectives.  The principal objectives of the proposed Project
are to: (a) augment power supplies to the capital; (b) improve the
reliability of transmission and reduce system losses; (c) reduce environmen-
tal pollution from power generation; (d) move towards more efficient use of
existing assets in the power supply system; (e) identify economic oppor-
tunities for improving the quality of coal used in power generation; and
(f) effect a program of administrative, financial and operational improve-
ments in DESU.
7.      Project Description.   The proposed Project comprises:
(a)  the construction of the first stage (4x210 MW) of a coal-fired power
station at Dadri comprising boilers, turbogenerators, electrical and
mechanical equipment, associated civil works and switchyard;
(b) rehabilitation of the power station at Badarpur to improve its
efficiency and reduce the impact of its future operations on the
environment;
(c) the construction of about 110 km of double circuit 400-kV transmis-
sion line and related 400-kV and 220-kV substations at Karawalnagar,
Bawana, Bamnoli, and Ballabgharh;
(d) consulting services to assist NTPC in the review of the engineering
of the first stage of the power station at Dadri, in the design and
preparation of specificatioas for its ash disposal system, and in a
study on improvement of the quality of coal used in power generation;
and
(e) consulting services to assist DESU in: (i) preparation of a least
cost plan for the extension and reinforcement of the distribution
network in Delhi; (ii) design and implementation of a system for the
compilation, storage and retrieval of technical data on the distribu-
tion network in Delhi; (iii) assessment of the economic viability of
equipping the combustion turbines adjacent to Indraprashtha with



-3-
waste heat recovery boilers and steam turbogenerators; (iv) prepara-
tion of a plan for the rehabilitation of the power station at
Indraprastha; (v) finalization of its financial statements for
1983/84, 1984/85 and 1985/86; (vi) implementation of a new commercial
accounting system; and (vii) execution of an organization and manage-
ment study.
8.      The total cost of the proposed Project, which will be implemented
over a period of about eight years, is estimated at US$1,524.1 million equiv-
alent including interest during construction, of which the foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$608.9 million (40%). Cost estimates, the
financing plan and retroactive financing arrangements are shown in Schedule
A. Procurement and disbursement arrangements and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank operations in India are given in Schedules C and D respec-
tively. A map, IBRD No. 19611, is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
6720-IN, dated May 28, 1987 is being distributed separately.
9.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Through its participation in the
Project, the Bank would be supporting GOI's efforts to: (a) augment gener-
ating capacity and alleviate the chronic power shortages in the Capital and
the Northern Region; (b) improve the capacity and reliability of power trans-
mission in the Capital area and reduce system losses by forming a 400-kV ring
around Delhi; (c) make more efficient and fuller use of Badarpur; and
(d) bring about environmental improvements by reducing pollution from Badar-
pur. In addition, the Bank would, through this Project: (a) introduce DESU
to state-of-the-art distribution planning; (b) help to stimulate rehabilita-
tion and environmental improvements in relation to Indraprastha; (c) cause
L'ESU to investigate the feasibility of converting its combustion turbines to
combined cycle plant; (d) help to set DESU on a sound financial footing
through execution of a financial recovery program; and (e) ensure a proper
analysis of the benefits of improving the quality of coal used in power
generation.
10.     Agreed Actions.  GOI has agreed to:  (a) furnish the Bank with the
report of its Committee examining power supply arrangements for the Capital
by July 1987; (b) furnish the Bank with a satisfactory financial recovery
plan for DESU by February 29, 1988, and thereafter implement this plan; and
(c) instruct DESU to capitalize interest during construction. NTPC has
agreed to: (a) enter into a coal supply contract for the Dadri power station
one year prior to the operation of the first unit; (b) maintain accounts
receivable for electricity sales at an amount equivalent to its power sales
revenues for the two preceding months; (c) achieve annual rates of return on
unrevalued net fixed assets in operation of not less than 7% through 1989/90,
9.5% in 1990/91 through 1994/95 and satisfactory rates thereafter; and
(d) submit audited financiallstatements together with the auditors' reports
within seven months of the end of the related financial year. DESU has
agreed to: (a) engage the services of NTPC for the design, engineering and



-4-
construction supervision of the 400-kV transmission lines and associated
substations. (b) ensure that accounts receivable from electricity consumers
do not exceed the equivalent of 4 months electricity sales in 1987/88, 3
months in 1988/89 and 2.5 months thereafter; (c) establish satisfactory
arrangements for recovery of Haryana State Electricity Board's share of the
costs of operating the Indraprastha power station; (d) implement the finan-
cial recovery plan determined by GOI, taking all such measures as are neces-
sary to reach a minimum rate of return of 3% after interest in 1990/91 and
maintain this performance thereafter; (e) submit unaudived and audited finan-
cial statements with the auditor's report for 1983/84 through 1987/88 accord-
ing to a timetable acceptable to the Bank; (f) submit unaudited and audited
financial statement together with the auditor's report for 1988/89 and there-
after within I and 9 months respectively of the financial year end; and
(g) carry out studies included in the proposed Project in accordance with
timetables acceptable to the Bank.
11.     Justification.  Economic benefits under the proposed Project are
expected from: increases in the quantum of power supplied to consumers;
improvements in the quality of power supply; reduced system losses; and
greater efficiency in the uses of assets in the public power supply system.
The least cost power development program for the Northern Region, of which
the proposed Project is an integral part, is expected to have a quantifiable
economic rate of return of at least 11%. In addition to its economic
benefits the Project would confer environmental benefits through a reduction
in pollution from power generation.
12.     Risks.  There are no extraordinary technical risks associated with
the Project. The dual firing feature of the power plant will minimize the
risk of plant unavaiL. ;l' y arising from the transportation of coal over a
long distance. NTPC is euperienced in the design and construction of gener-
ation and transmission facilities but will receive assistance from consult-
ants in relation to the dry ash disposal system.
13.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
