MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS S.N.C.
FOR A HOUSING .INANCE PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
a housing finance project to Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Publicos
S.N.C. (BANOBRAS) with the guarantee of the United Mexican States for
US$300 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be
repaid over 15 years including 5 years of grace.
2.       Background.  The population of Mexico is young and has been
growing rapidly, particularly in the main cities, requiring a significant
expansion of the housing stock. While the level of annual new investment
in housing is comparable to other countries at a similar level of
development, Mexico's housing deficit of about 5.0 million units is large
and continues to grow. The housing problem is compounded by the
population's unever. and generally low capacity to generate savings for
housing financing and the scarcity of long-term housing finance. Mexico
has a highly segmented structure of housing supply. During the past
decade, about two thirds of housing has been supplied by the informal
sector i.e., the households themselves, and the remainder has been financed
equally by public programs and financial institutions. In recent years,
the informal sector and financial institutions have reduced their voluntary
participation in the sector while the relative importance of public
programs has increased in response to adverse economic developments.   High
inflatlon and real wage decreases have had a negative effect on
availability and affordability of housing finance. In 1985, housing
financing through public p-ograms amounted to about US$2.75 billion
equivalent for 363,000 housing units. Public sector finance for housing is
provided mainly by commercial banks and payroll funds with a share of about
432 each of the total, and by various federal and state housing agencies
(14Z). Central Bank regulations require the commercial banking system to
lend 6Z of its total res,;urces for two categories of low and middle income
housing. Because of the large differential between mortgage portfolio
yields and the ACF (the average cost of funds to the banking system and the
key market reference rate in Mexico's financial system) foregone revenues
of the commercial banks amounted to some US$670 million equivalent in 1986.
These revenue losses forced commercial banks to increase interest rates on
their unregulated loans to at least partially offset these losses. The
Fondo de Operacion y Financiamiento Bancario a la Vivienda (FOVI), a trust
fund of the Central Bank, supervises compliance with Central Bank housing
regulations and provides supplementary financing once individual banks have
met their mandatory 62 lending requirement. FOVI is well managed and
efficient, following sound housing standards and supervision practices.
3.       In order to address the severe credit subsidy problems resulting
from high and increasing levels of inflation and low fixed interest
mortgage rates under the mandatory lending system, a new variable rate
mortgage instrument was introduced in 1984. Because of expected resistance
from borrowers, interest rates were initially set well below market rates,



and full cost recovery could not be achieved. As inflation continued to
rise, thp authorities made further significant adjustments to the new
system in 1986 and 1987 to reduce subsidies, and in March 1988, Central
Bank regulations allowing full cost recovery were issued. However,
effective implementation requires appropriate action in each one of the 32
Mexican states. Main features of the new mortgage system are: (a) interest
rates equal to ACF; (b) monthly loan payments defined as a percentage of
the loan amount, and ad;usted in parallel with the minimum wage to ensure
affordability; (c) no limit on capitalization of interest, in casa the
monthly loan payment is insufficient to cover the interest due; and (d) a
flexible loan maturity subject to a 20 year maximum term. GOM has
furnished the Bank with a Letter on Housing Sector Policies indicating its
intention to (i) maintain the current system of full cost recovery and to
(ii) review issues concerning mobilization of savings for housing finance
and for the development of rental housing and take remedial action, if
appropriate.
4.       Rationale for Bank involvement.  The Bank's involvement in the
proposed project is important to help fully implement the housing loan
reform measures and pursue the agreed policy initiatives in the future.
The proposed project would be the second of several proposed operations
aimed at supporting Mexico's housing sector. It would build upon the
findings of: (i) sector analyses underlying the Low Income Housing Project
(Loan 2612-ME) approved in 1985 and (ii) a housing finance study carried
out by the Central Bank under Loan 2612-ME in close cooperation with the
Bank. The study focused on the provision of housing finance through the
commercial banks, the payroll funds, the low income housing fund (FONHAPO)
and the informal sector. Its findings contributed to improved cost recovery
on housing finance provided by the commercial banks and FONHAPO (the
intermediary under Loan 2612-ME) and it provided a key analytical input to
the formulation of a GOM Housing Policy Statement in February 1987.
Preparation of the proposed project during a two year period was closely
linked to this process, especially to supporting GOM efforts to eliminate
subsidies on wandator- housing lending by the commercial banks.  This
conti.nuing dialogue between the Bank and the GOM was an important element
in achieving the March 1988 reform, which finally introduces full cost
recovery on housing loans. This achievement greatly facilitates GOM's
efforts to reduce the pressure on interest rates by providing the basis for
gradually eliminating revenue losses to the commercial banks on their
mandatory housing loan portfolio, which is a key step towards the
resumption of voluntary commercial bank lending for housing. In addition,
achieving full cost recovery strongly supports the GO1's strategy of
eliminating overall credit subsidies.
5.       Project Objectives. The primary project objectives would be to:
(i) support housing finance reforms allowing commercial banks to achieve
full cost recovery on mandatory housing loans; (ii) stimulate the
introduction of savings schemes geared to households and institutions;
(iii) increase the supply of affordable housing to the lower income
segments of the population, especially through the testing of a new lower
priced housing product; (iv) provide a strong incentive to state
governments to reform speedily mortgage registration procedures necessary
to register mortgage liens which fully cover interest capitalization; and
(v) widen the sector dialogue to include the role of the public sector,
coordination of public housing programs, and policies related to investment
in rental housing and mobi'lization of savings by households and
institutions.

6.       Project Description.  The project would help finance construction
and individual mortgage loans by the commercial banks up to 1993
exclusively for the lower priced housetype (Type A) which is targeted to
households with an income of up to 4.0 minimum wages. The loan would fund
only those housing loans which incorporate the March 1988 Central Bank
regulations that allow full cost recovery. Bank funds would be channeled
by BANOBRAS to FOVI for onlending to the commercial banks. The proposed
loan would contribute about 19? of the total funding requirements for Type
A housing during the project implementation period.
7.       Actions Agreed Upon:  During negotiations it was agreed that: (i)
the full amount of the Loan will only fund subloans which incorporate the
March 1988 reforms ; (ii) by March 31, 1989, a study will be completed on
incentives required to tap savings from households and institutions, the
results of which will include a proposed plan for implementation to be
discussed with the Bank by June 30, 1989 and subsequently appropriate
actions will be implemented; (iii) by December 31, 1989, a study will be
completed to review the t.ousing rental market and to identify measures
required to make investment in rental properties sufficiently attractive,
and by March 31, 1990, the study, together with an implementation plan,
would be discussed with the Bank and appropriate act ons implemented
thereafter; (iv) FOVI will complete test-marketing of about 2,500 houses of
a new housing product (selling at a price of 202 lower than the prevailing
market price for Type A housing) by March 31, 1989 and review results by
June 30, 1989; and (v) GOM will take measures, as appropriate, to promote
mobilization of savings for housing finance and investment in rental
housing. A lette. discussing the GOM's Housing Sector Polices has been
received in the Bank.
8.       Benefits.  The Mexican Government assigns high priority to meeting
the housing needs if its population: in this context the achievement of
full cost recovery is an important step toward the resumption af voluntary
commercial bank lending and the mobilization of savings for housing. The
loan would increase the supply of affordable housing to lower income
households, especially by supporting the development of a lower priced
h3using product.
9.       Risks:  With the regulatory basis for full cost recovery already
in place upfront, there are no major risks involved. However, each Mexican
State needs to complement the March 1988 reforms by reforming speedily
mortgage registration procedures. The risk of any slowdown in
disbursements, however, is considered minor, especially since the loan
provides a strong incentive for action.
10.      Recommendations:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan.
