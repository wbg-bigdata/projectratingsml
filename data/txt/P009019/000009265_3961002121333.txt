DERKE HYDROPOWER PRQJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:               The Republic of Turkey
Beneficiary:            Qukurova Elektrik A.S. (CEAS)
Amount:                 US$270 Million Equivalent
Term:                    Seventeen years, including a five-year grace period, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:        The Government would charge VEAS an onlending fee
equivalent to 35 basis points p.a. on the outstanding
balance of the Loan.   gEAS would bear the foreign
exchange risk, as well as the interest risk on the Bank
Loan.
Project Description:    The proposed Project would provide for the installation
of 510 MW hydroelectric generating capacity comprising
three units of 170 MW located betwe.t the Sir and
Aslantas Hydropower Plants and expansion, transmission
system. The hydro plant would comprise tv-. onstruction
of a double curvature thin arch dam with & height of 201
m, an energy tunnel of 2.05 km length and an inside
diameter of 9.30 m, and an undezground power plant. The
reservoir active volume would be about 300 million m3.
When completed the complex will provide 1,600 GWh p.a.
of electric energy. The transmission component would
comprise construction of 737 km 154 kV transmission
lines and 12 substations with installed transformer
capacity of 1,350 MVA and a modern load dispatch center.
Benefit and Risks:      The measurable benefits attributable to the proposed
Project include incremental generation of electricity by
the private sector with no claims on GOT's budget for
the domestic financing of the project, and for the share
of the financing plan to be covered by IFC.   An
additional important benefit is the demonstration effect
expected to derive from the success of the expansion of
QEAS's scope of activities as an integrated, privately
owned, regional power utility, effectively cooperating
with TEK in Turkey's power subsector. The main risks
envisaged are the possibility of construction delays
derived from construction site conditions as well as the
size of the project, which is large in relation to the
implementation  capacity  of  CEAS.    This  risk  is
substantially  reduced  since  CEAS  has  appointed
consultants of proven competence, to assist in design
and engineering as well as implementation.

BERKE HYDROPOWER PROJECT
STAFF APEPlISAL REPORT
I.  THE ENERGY  SEO    D THE POWER SUBSECTOR
A. Energ SLector
Overvie
1.01        Turkey has made remarkable progress in developing its commercial
energy base over the last two decades.  Net primary energy supply increased
threefold since 1970, reaching 58.8 million TOE in 1990. Lignite is the most
important commercial source of domestic energy (with an output of 11.4 million
TOE, representing 19 percent of the totel energy supplied) followed by about 7.1
million TOE of hydroelectric generation (providing 12 percent of total primary
energy supply). The volume of non-commercial energy consumed in Turkey has
halved since 1980, but it still represents the second largest domestic source of
energy supply, with 131 of total net primary energy. The importance of natural
gas (of which 89 percent is imported) is slowly increasing (from 11 in 1987 to
71 in 1990) w.inly as a result of its increased competitiveness as an industrial
fuel and iti. ¶vironmental benefits relative to lignite fuels for electricity
generaticn     residential heating (natural gas is virtually sulfur-free and
burns with       - nw particulate emissions). The balance is accounted for by oil
(22.8 million  2, 891 of which is imported) and coal (57 million TOE, 56X
imported).  The ener7- sector balances for 1990 are illustrated in Annex 1.1.
1.02        Turkey's final co.-umption of commercial energy is estimated to be
at about 44.9 million TO'(  TVa two largest consumers of commercial energy are
the industrial sector (ab; rt.'x  35Z of total energy), and the residential sector
(391). Fossil fuels meet 611 of the energy requirements of the manufacturing
sector but they will be partially substituted by electricity (whose relative
share will increase from 17X in 1990 to 221 in 2010) and they will provide
approximately 51.5X of the sector's requirements by the year 2010.
Transportation is almost entirely fueled by imported oil, the consumption of
which amounts to 8.3 million TOE in 1990 and will reach 10.7 million TOE in 1995
(more than doubling by the year 2010). Turkey is expanding its renewable energy
base: solar energy finds some application in the household sector but it still
provides a negligible portion of total energy consumed (estimated at 0.11 in
1991). Per capita consumption of commercial energy was 0.687 TOE/cap in 1990 and
is estimated to steadily increase to more than double by 2010 (reaching 1.647
TOE/cap).
Energy Reoum
1.03        Hydroelectric Poteniial. Development of hydroelectric resources, an
indigenous source of energ;. has been steadily increasing since the 1970s.
Development should be accelerated even further in the next 20 years in order to
match the subsector's required investment expansion.   Approximately 241 of
Turkey's hydroelectric potential (estimated at about 31 GW) has been developed,
and an additional 4 oW is expected to come on-stream by 1994.
1.04        Lignite.  Lignite is an entirely domestic energy resource and it is
mainly utilized for residential heating (where it is being gradually replaced by
natural gas in the major cities for environmental reasons) and for firing thermal
power plants. Lignite fuels are mainly produced in western Turkey and in the



-2-
Afsin-Elbistan region; deposits (50 percent of which have low calorific value and
high sulfur content) are estimated at 8.2 billion tons (about 1 billion TOE).
Consumption of lignite grew by an average of 14X since 1980; this escalation was
mainly caused by the expansion of lignite-based power generation, which rose to
5.58 million TOE in 1990, increasing by 29.6X since 1970 and absorbing 492 of
Turkey's total net supply of lignite. Lignite is currently the basis for 292 of
power generation. The largest end-user of lignite is the residential sector,
which accounts for 572 of total consumption. The industrial sector is the second
largest final consumer, absorbing the remaining 2.484 million TOE (432 of the
total).
1.05        Non-Commercial Energy.  Non-commercial energy mainly consists of
biomass, which supplies 7.7 million TOE to the household sector (the main
consumer). Approximately 33.72 of the energy used for cooking in Turkey is non-
commercial.  This proportion will drop to 26.32 in 1995 (when non-commercial
energy is expected to be partially replaced by fossil energy), and it will
further decrease to 152 in 2010.   Fuelwood ls mainly utilized for heatin&
purposes; it provided 50.92 of total energy required by the household sector in
1983. Households still depend on fuelwood for 322 of their heating requirements;
the importance of fuelwood ls expected to gradually decline but remain
signlficant at 152 in 2010.
1.06        Coal. The domestic production of coal decllned during the past two
decades because of rising production costs, due to increasingly difficult
extraction. The industrial sector's demand was met by raising imports to 53.52
of total coal consumed in 1987. Total primary coal supply amounts to about 5.7
million TOE, of which 43 percent (equivalent to 2.4 million TOE) is produced
domestically and the remaining 572 imported. Final consumption consists of 2.8
million TOE and is mainly absorbed by the residential sector (692) and by the
industrial sector (302).
1.07        Natural Gas.  Natural gas represents 62 of total primary energy
supply. Domestic production consists of 12 million cubic meters per year (410
thousand TOE) extracted from the Hamitabat field in Thrace and represents 112 of
total supply. Imports amount to 3.1 million TOE and are increasing very rapidly,
as demand is expected to rise more than threefold by the late 1990s. Natural gas
is mainly utilized in power generation and industry, and its importance is
increasing as a response to environmental concerns.   Approximately 152 of
electricity is in fact produced by ccmbined-cycle plants and this proportion is
expected to increase to 202 by the year 2000, representing 262 of total power
subsector's installed capacity by the year 2010.  Natural gas is also being
increasingly uxilized for residential heating in major cities.
1.08        Since 1987 a gas supply contract with the USSR has been ln place,
whereby imports via Bulgaria are to reach 5.6 bcm/y by 1992 (4.6 million TOE).
Under this fifteen year contract at least 702 of the cost of the imported gas is
covered by counter-trade, thus enabling Turkey to expand its exports to the USSR.
In addition, liquefied natural gas (LNG) to be imported from Algeria to the
terminal facility now under construction in Thrace, is expected to reach, after
a four year buildup, 2 bcm/y by 1997 (1.6 million TOE). More recently, the
Government has reportedly signed a protocol with Libya to import 1.5 bcm/y of LNG
(0.8 million TOE), and negotiations on price are underway. A substantial share
of imported gas is currently allocated to bulk users, i.e., the power and
industrial sectors.
1.09        Under the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the gas distribution and transmission
network was extended, so as to inerease efficiency of imported gas utilization.



-3
In particular, expansion of the gas distribution network in the cities of Bursa
and Eskischir began and storage facilities of imported gas were developed in
order to allow for a more efficient management of supplies during the peak demand
period.
1.10        Crude Qil and Petroleum Product.  Total crude oil supply in 1990
amounted to 21.8 million TOE. Of these, 19.2 million TOE (88X) were imported.
Proven hydrocarbon reserves consist of 250 million barrels (about 35 million TOE)
of oil and 0.5 billion cubic feet (about 12.5 thousand TOE) of natural gas.
Domestic production has slightly increased during 1980-90, accounting for
approximately 12X of domestic demand in 1989. This proportion is not expected
to increase substantially because of the limited prospectivity of Turkey's
geology. Losses in the refinery process averaged 5.4X of total crude oil supply
during the 1980s.
Energy Sector Prices
1.11        Turkey'5 energy pricing policy has experienced wide fluctuatioias
since the early 1980s. While the first half of the past decade was characterized
by an ini;r4asing trend in most energy prices, this policy was relaxed during the
second half following the decline of oil prices worldwide, but also reflecting
a loosening of Turkey's demand management policies at a macro level. After 1988,
important corrective measures on the level and structure of energy prices have
been introduced with the support of the Bank. Table 1.1 shows the evolution of
relative prices of key energy products since 1980.   Important features of
Turkey's energy pricing policies are:
(a)   After a period of relative increases in all energy prices during
1980-1985, except for lignite and residential electricity tariffs,
most prices declined sharply until 1988. Since then, most energy
prices  have  been  increased.    Energy  sources  that  have  not
experienced a real price increase compared to 1988 price levels are
heavy fuel oil, natural gas and lignite for power generation.
(b)   The early 1980s policy of encouraging the substitution of imported
fuel oil by lignite (a domestic resource), through relative price
incentives  for  all  consumption  categories  (i.e.,  industrial,
household and power generation), has been gradually reversed during
the last few years. This shift is partially attributed to GOT's
concerns on the environmental impact of an increasing consumption of
lignite as well as to the declining real prices of petroleum
products worldwide.
(c)   Domestic lignite is the cheapest energy resource for thermal power
generation, on an equivalent heat basis. Lignite prices for power
generation are currently 411 of those for natural gas and only 29X
of heavy fuel oil. Conversely, lignite prices for industrial use
are competitive with natural gas, which costs only 21 more on a
comparative heat basis, while fuel oil remains as the most expensive
source of energy (421 higher). This policy of promoting natural gas
use in industry has caused an annual average increase of 901 in
consumption since 1988.
(d)   In spite of the increase in lignite prices and the significant fall
of gas prices for household consumption which took place during the
last two years, lignite remains the cheapest source of energy at the



-4-
household level. Currently, lignite prices are only 60% and 18X of
natural gas and electricity prices, respectively, on an equivalent
heat basis.
(e)    Generally speaking,  the relative price of electricity has gradually
improved with respect to its main thermal generation inputs (heavy
fuel  oil,   lignite  and  natural  gas).               Electricity  tariffs  to
residential consumers declined dramatically until 1989, whereas
tariffs  to  industrial  and commercial  consumers  inereased.    Since
then, the cross-subsidy from industrial/commercial consumers to
residential has been substantially reduced.
(f)    Domestic prices for petroleum products increased con-  3Urably during
1980-85. These prices fell significantly durinp : . remainder of
the decade, ranging from a fall of 382 to 302 a.. p! talleling the
decline of world market crude oil prices.   Gasoline and diesel oil
prices have been increased during the last year thus reaching real
values similar to those of 1980.

Institutions of the Energy Sectgr
1.12        The Mivistry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) is responsible
for managing, regulating and planning the development of the energy sector. MENR
has also been given primary responsibility for establishing policies and
regulations for accelerating private sector involvement in energy development.
At the operating level, the energy sector is dominated by State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs). The Turkish Hard Coal Enterprise (TTK), the Turkish Lignite
Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) and the Mineral
Research Institute (MTA) have responsibility for the extractionl of fossil fuels
and radioactive materials. The production, transport and marketing of petroleum
products are undertaken respectively by Turkish Petroleun, Refineries Corporation
(TUPRAS), Petroleum Pipelines Corporation (BOTAS) and Petrol Ofisi (marketing and
distribution). Design and construction of hydroelectric schemes is entrusted to
the State Hydraulics Akuthority (DSI). The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)
is responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of almost all
the electricity sold in Turkey, including the operation of the DSI-built
hydropower plants.   TEK is also responsible for the implementation of the
Government's rural electrification program and the construction of all publicly
owned thermal power plants and transmission and distribution facilities. The
Electricity Survey Administration (EIE) is responsible for renewable onergy,
hydropower surveys and for the formulation and implementation of the national
energy conservation program.   Table 1.2 lists the main energy institutions
classified by subsector and the Ministry to which each institution refers.
1.13        The Public Participation Administration (PPA) is an extra-budgetary
national fund for investments in infrastructure. Although not formally part of
the energy sector, it plays a significant role in mobilizing financing for the
power subsector. In particular, hydropower facilities constructed by DSI are
financed by the PPA, the national budget and foreign credits and loans. PPA's
sources of funds comprise market instruments such as revenue sharing bonds, and
since 1985, a levy on TEK's generation from certain large hydropower plants whose
construction was financed by PPA. The private sector indirectly contributes to
the funding of PPA, since a portion of the taxes levied on revenues from energy
sales is earmarked for the fund.

1.14        Direct private  investment  is  largest  in  the power  subsector
(paras 1.25-1.28) with two regional utilities (QEAS and KEPEZ) totalling 690 MW
of installed capacity and two small BOT hydro projects (Hasanlar and AksU-Caykoy)
which have come on-strea.m in 1991 with a cumulative installed capacity of 24.35
MW. The operation of two energy distribution networks located in the Kayseri and
Aktas (eastern Istanbul regions) respectively, has been turned over to two
private companies.   The power subsector also counts on a few industrial
autoproducers, which generate approximately 6X of total electricity. Private
participation in the other subsectors consists of small coal mines, one refinery
and joint ventures with TPAO for petroleum exploration and petroleum product
marketing.  The stcps being taken by the Government in prioritizing private
investment mobilization and in exploring different investment funding options for
energy indicate that the private sector will play an increasingly important role,
as it is expected to provide the additional investment to supplement constrained
public funds which is indispensable to meet the future energy requirements of
Turkey.
Investmetnt Financing
1.15        The  evolution  of
energy investment is explained
by the dynamics of the broader
macroeconomic context.   During
the late 1980s, the Government         Energy Sector: Fixed Capital Investment
financed  the  capital  account        Eo e          . F    C
deficit   and   covered   the            4
requirements of the consolidated
public   sector   by   placing
financial claims on the doriestic       '
bond market.    As  a  result,    !  u. 
public expenditure shifted from
investment  financing  to  debt
servicing, no longer sustaining ..
the  large  energy  investments    I
with  long  gestation  periods
which had been financed in the
previous years. Private savings
were, to some extent, channelled
to fuel the requirements of an    o                   " .  _        '
inefficient   public   sector.
Figure  1.1  illustrates   the
movements of total energy fixed
capital investment (classified
by source of financing) in the  Figure 1.1: Fixed Capital Investment in
second half of the 1980s. Public            the Energy Sector (1985-1990)
investment in fixed capital
peaked at TL 3,448 billion in
1986 (growing by 141 from the previous year). This level of public investment
was however eroded by almost 111 during 1987-88, dropping by approximately 22X
in 1990 after a slight recovery in 1989.
1.16        The share of private fixed capital investment has been increasing
(with fluctuations in 1985 and 1986) at a decreasing rate during the same period.
The largest expansion of private investment in energy was recorded in 1988, when
it was raised by 65.81 from the previous year. The actual estimated volume of
energy investment from private sources amounted to TL 264 billion in 1990 (in
constant 1988 prices). The wider presence of private capital did not compensate



-7-
for the cut-backs  in public financing sources.   Total volume of energy
investment, which had declined to TL 3,255 billion in 1987, slowly recovered
during the two subsequent years, dropping again in 1990 to TL 2,769 bn (the
lowest value since 1985).
InRut-Substitution Strategy vis-a-vis the Environmental Constraint
1.17        The policies and investments launched during 1980-1990 in response
to the two major oil shocks were largely successful not only in overcoming the
serious energy shortages of the 1970s - early 1980s, but also in changing
significantly the structure of the energy sector toward less dependence on
imported oil. The evolution of the country's overall energy balance during the
past decade, discussed in paras 1.1 - 1.10 illustrates such progress. By 1990
Turkey's overall energy intensity had increased considerably, since net primary
energy consumption grew by about 72% during the 1980s, as compared to a 49%
increase of real GDP. With the supply of electricity having grown faster (gross
supply more than doubling in 1980-89), the country's dependence on petroleum
products had fallen by as much as 5 percentage points to 55% of total commercial
consumption. Consequently, in 1990, electricity (of which less than 1% of net
supply was imported), accounted for a somewhat larger proportion (27.5%) of all
commercial energy supplied than in 1980 (23%), with industry's share having
declined over the past decade to the benefit of residential consumption. In
parallel, the use of domestic lignite expanded significantly during the 1980s (by
as much as 6 percentage points) representing in 1990 about 19% of commercial
energy consumed.
1.18        Oil-based power generation was partly substituted by a greater use
of domestic lignite during 1980-1990; only 12% of total generation was oil-based
in 1990 (compared to 25% in 1980), while lignite-based generation has increased
more than threefold (by 371%) during the same period. However, as a response to
the Government's commitment to contain the volume and level of emissions from
thermal power plants within EEC-comparable pollution control standards, and as
a result of lower than projected demand growth, the new lignite-fired generation
has been underutilized in the past few years; full capacity utilization is not
expected to be achieved before 1995. Consequently, Turkey's plan for further
expansion of electricity generation to meet demand growth projected to the end
of the century, is less reliant on domestic lignite and consistent with the need
to balance the trade-off between substituting for imported fuels and confining
the implementation of lignite-based generation to those investments which prove
economically justifiable within the environmental constraint. The generation
expansion plan, therefore, calls for a greater share of hydro-generation and for
a further expansion of imported but cleaner natural gas combined-cycle based
capacity.
1.19        Notwithstanding  the  vigorous  policy  of  indigenous  resource
development undertaken by the Government since the 1970s, Turkey's dependence on
imported energy was exacerbated over the last decade.   The share of energy
imports in the country's overall net supply of primary energy increased from 44%
in 1980 to 46% in 1990. Due to greater reliance on imported natural gas and
coal with lower sulphur content, the energy import bill absorbed approximately
4% of the GDP in 1990. This trend reveals clearly the conflict faced by Turkey's
energy policy between its trade balance and environmental objectives.

B. The Power Subsector
OveMrvl
1.20        Turkey  has  a  total  installed  capacity  of  18  oW,  of  which
approximately 431 based on hydro power, 301 based on lignite, and 151 based on
natural gas. Fuel oil-fired plants represent 121 of total capacity installed
(the composition of installed capacity in 1990 i8 illustrated in Figure 1.2).
The   system   generatea   56   TWh   of
electricity in 1990, of which 26 TWh
(471) was from hydropower.   Annex 1.2
illustrates  the  configuration  of  the          -4woneton of Inut-lI.a clpaity

and the expected trend of electricity               .e C
generation and electricity sales during
(1991-2010).   According to the current
least-cost  development  plan  for  the    c
subsector, the relative  importance of
natural gas will increase to 26 percent
by end-1991, when 50 percent of total
installed capacity will be hydro-based.
Total generation and distribution losses
amount to approximately 17.21, having
decreased by an average of 1X per year
since 1984.

8,660 km of high voltage transmission

voltage transmission network at 220, 154 and 66 kV. The distribution system's
grid consists of 309,815 km of distribution lines with a cumulative distribution
transformer capacity of 14,611 tVA. The system encompasses 593 transformers (541
of which at 154 kV level). Annex 1.3 contains a detailed descriptions of the
transmission system across different kV levels and of the distribution system
during 1981-1990. A tabulation of the status of distribution facilities and of
substations composition is in Annex 1.4.
Power Subsector Strategy
1.22        The Government's basic strategy for the power subsector is to ensure
a balanced, least-cost expansion of the system at a rate adequate to meet the
country's economic growth requirements and is articulated along the following
main policies: (a) improving the operational and financial efficiency of
subsector; (b) reforming the pricing policies on the basis of the LRHC of supply;
(c) reallocating public investment to correct those systemic imbalances in the
power sector which have led to inadequate investments in transmission and
distribution vis-a-vis investment in power generation; (d) maximizing prlvate
investment in power generation; (e) developing an institutional framework suited
to attract private investors and facilitate their co-existence with the public
sector utility; (f) reducing the environmental impact of the existing thermal
plants, where feasible, and limiting new investment in lignite-based generation.
1.23        Pursuing the above policies, GOT's objectives for the sector include:
(i) providing an adequate basis for tariff setting and maximizing investment
funding; (ii) modernizing and improving the efficiency of the public power
sector; (iii) turning around the market's perception of the uncertainties
associated with power generation investments by developing clear regulatory



- 9 -
policies; (iv) adapting the regulatory framework to the needs of a mixed system;
and (v) mitigating and monitoring the adverse environmental impact of domestic
lignite-fueled power generation.
Power System Expansion
1.24        Due to the severe energy shortages in the 1970s and early 1980s,
domestic lignite-based power generation was expanded at a fast pace in order to
alleviate the sector's dependence on imported energy. The establishment of the
PPA fund supported DSI's large investments in hydro-generation during the 1980s.
Overall power system expansion during 1986-90 was characterized by contingency
decision-making dependent on budgetary constraints.   With the commitment of
funding mainly concentrated on the ongoing generation expansion, investment in
transmission and distribution was in fact not commensurate to Saintain a balanced
power system.  The lack of adequate investment planning and the authorities'
overestimation of economic expansion and of power demand growth resulted in over-
investment in generation, reflected by an excessive reserve margin of the
generation system's installed capacity (82.1X in 1990). The generation capacity
reserve margin which can ensure adequate contingency-responsiveness and
reliability of the system is estimated at 35-40Z of total generation capacity
(corresponding to a loss of load probability of 2-3X).

reached   under   the   TEK
Restructuring Project which Figure 1.3
at the same time aims at
improving operational efficiency of TEK. The generation system expansion program
planned from 1991 to 2010 and reviewed by the Bank is sequenced so as to ensure
that system's reserve margins will fall within the optimal range and that the
system's expansion will adequately meet increasing demand for electricity. The
observed and expected trends in the level of reserve margins and in the
corresponding loss of load probability (LOLP) are illustrated in Figure 1.3 (a
higher reserve margin corresponding to a higher level of reliability of the
system). Reserve margins reduced to 69.11 in 1991, and will steadily decrease
to a desired level of about 371 by 1996.
1.26        The current Government target of increasing GDP by an average of
about 6X a year during 1991-2010 would result in an average yearly growth of
electricity demand of around 91 during the same period. On this basis, the long-



- 10 -
term least-cost expansion plan for the power subsector (1991-2010) calls for an
increase in generation capacity of about 47 GW (15.5 GW for hydropower).
Conversely, the critical value of average GDP growth which would require no
additional investment in power generation (given a reserve margin of 35-40X)
corresponds to approximately 2 percent annual growth during 1996-2010. Annex 1.6
contains a synoptic table of the simulations obtained with a demand forecast
modell/, showing that, other assumptions being held constant, an average level
of GDP growth above 2 percent during 1996-2010 requires new investment in power
generation during 1991-2010 (the average construction period of generation plants
being approximately five years).
Plan and the Role of Private Sector Investment
1.27        The fluctuations in the fixed capital investment observed during the
second half of the 1980s (paras 1.15-1.16) were reflected in the imbalances in
the expansion of the power subsector. The significant investments in generation
expansion (66X of total power investment) were not matched by an adequate
upgrading of the transmission and distribution networks, which together accounted
for only 16X of total power investment during the Fifth Plan (1984-88)
(para 1.22). Agreement on the least cost-expansion plan corresponding to tha
Sixth Plan (1990-94) including its financing, was reached under the TEK
Restructuring Project (Ln. 3455-TU), subject to annual reviews. Investment in
the subsector under the Sixth Plan calls for a rationalization of investment
allocation, with a 62X reduction of incremental investment in generation and a
greater emphasis on transmission and distribution (to reach 521 of total
investment in the subsector). Moreover, the plan foresees the increased
participation of private investments as a portion of total incremental
investment, expected to total US$ 2.7 billion by 1994 (about 27X of total
additional investment).
1.28        Private investment in the subsector is planned to reach approximately
251 of total investment in generation by 1999 (of which 221 are expected to be
met by BOT consortia).   Table 1.3 describes the actual status of private
investment in generation.  Results in Implementing the private participation
strategy have been mixed; QEAS is at the moment the private utility with the
largest generation capacity (598 MW), 821 of which is hydro-based. With the
proposed Berke Project, SEAS would add 510 MW to its existing generation
capacity, doubling it size and becoming the largest private entity operating in
the subsector. Only two small BOT hydroplants (Hasanlar and Aksd-Cayk6y) have
come on-stream in 1991, with a total installed capacity of 24.35 MW.  In the
context of the rationalization/privatization strategy undertaken by TEK, the
management of the operation of the distribution networks in the regions of
Kayseri and eastern Istanbul (Aktas) has been transferred to private companies
on the basis of arrangements under which the local distribution utilities operate
on a cost-plus basis with a certain guaranteed margin of profit regardless of
their efficiency. A new performance-based management contract is being developed
by TEK for transferring in the future the operating rights of distribution
networks to qualified ,rivate companies/utilities.

1.29       A total investment of TL 546 billion (corresponding to a total
installed capacity of 401 MW) is planned to be commissioned by 1994 for
hydropower projects, 37X of which by BOTs. The Government projects that, of
these planned investments, TL 145 billion would be realized by the private sector
(26 percent of the total). The status of investment preparation however signals
that significant delays are inevitable. There have in fact been many proposals
to undertake BOT projects in the power sector, for which letters of intent have
been issued. However, the contract for the BOT projects have not been finalized
and their financing plans have not yet been defined. BOT projects which were to
provide 128 KW additional installed hydro-based capacity by 1994 have not been
initiated, with the exception of the two small hydro plants commissioned in 1991
(para 1.28). Hydro-generation capacity assumed to be implemented by BOTs beyond
1994 &mounts to 1.5 GW. The investment plan foresees an additional 1.6 GW of
thermal capacity by 1995 consisting in one BOT project (Aliaga-1000 MW) and a
natural gas combined-cycle plant (600 MW).   The financing plan for these
investments, as well as for the remaining 5.5 GW of new hydro-based installed
capacity to be built by DSI and expected to come on-stream during 1998-2003 have
not yet been defined, with the exception of the Kayraktepe Hydropower Project
(Ln. 2655-TU) (431 MW), to be commissioned in 1999.
1.30        Government expectations as to private investments' contribution to
the current expansion plan appear to be unrealistic as evidenced by the delays
in finalizing the BOT agreements. With the public investment in generation
constrained by finances, unless private investment is escalated in the short-run
the economy might experience a severe bottleneck in the energy sector. Domestic
private investment may be partly mobilized through the assignment of entrusted
regions to regional utilities, as in the case of 5ukurova and Antalya. Signals
in this direction are promising, as several companies have applled to the
Government to become regional utilities. Accordingly, IENR intends to gear the
institutional framework at hedging the utilities against the risk associated with
the uncertainty of investing in a mixed system. In particular, clear rules need



- 12 -
to be laid out with respect to competition for investment, determination of the
utilities' costing bases, formulation and ratification of power purchase
agreements between the utilities and TEK, handling of disputes, and allocation
of water rights among different users of the waters of the same river for hydro
projects. Moreover, MENR needs to rapidly step-up its expertise in evaluating
proposals for new investments. The revived institution-building component of the
ESAL (Ln. 2856-TU) and the sector reforms launched under the TER Restructuring
Project (Ln. 3455-TU) will contribute to these efforts.
Bank Role in the Power Subsector
1.31        The Bank's lending strategy in the energy sector has been consistent
with the Government's demand management objectives and macro stabilization
policies.   The composition of the Bank portfolio consists of five loans,
including a loan approved in 1991 (the TEK Restructuring Project, Ln. 3345-TU).
1.32        The Bank has helped to introduce state-of-the-art system planning
methodoLogies and has interacted with the sector agencies toward the formulation
of an adequate investment program. The recently completed TEK Transmission IV
(Ln. 2586-TU) and the ongoing Power Operations Assistance Project (Ln. 2602-TU)
supported the construction and rehabilitation of high-voltage transmission
facilities.
1.33        The Kayraktepe Hydro Project (Ln. 2655-TU) and the Sir Hydropower
Project (Ln. 2750-TU) supported hydro development and private sector involvement
(the loan beneficiary of the Sir project, as in the case of the proposed Project,
is 5EAS, a regional utility). The ESAL (Ln. 2856-TU) addressed the potential
bottlenecks in the energy sector, leading to less dependence on imported oil,
deregulation of the domestic markets for petroleum products, the preparation of
an institutional framework conducive to greater involvement of private ventures,
emphasis on the use of domestic resources for generation capacity expansion in
the power subsector and increased use of natural gas. Under the ESAL, the
management system of TEK was reviewed and representatives from the Treasury, SPO
and MENR were included in TEK's Board of Directors with the aim of introducing
external accountability and improving coordination among the agencies involved
in the power industry. Furthermore, under the ESAL agreements TEK began to have
its accounts audited by private auditors of international repute (Price
Waterhouse), in addition to the Government's statutory auditors.
1.34        PCRs on three Bank financed projects in the power subsectors (Loan
1023-TU, 1844-TU and 2650-TU) noted major problems with regard to TEK's
performance, including, in particular, weak financial management, absence of
strategic corporate planning, lack of autonomy and inadequate tariff levels. TEK
emerged as a major contributor to GOT's PSBR. The Bank was requested to assist
GOT iir restructuring TEK. Subsequent Bank lending pursued a sectoral approach
ensuing from the ESAL experience. The TEK Restructuring Project addresses those
weaknesses of TEK which have led to the utility's insolvency and those sectoral
issues which have caused misallocation of chronically scarce public funds for
power investments. In the context of that project, agreement was reached with
GOT/TEK on: (a) indexing electricity tariffs and linking them to the LRKC of
supply; (b) establishing cost centers to monitor the efficiency of plants
operations; and (c) monitoring TEK's financial performance and investments
through  the adoption of cor"orate planning.    Moreover,  by bringing and
maintaining real electricity tariffs to UtKC level, the project will expand the
utilities' revenue basis throughout the sector, supporting their financial
viability and improving their potential for sustaining and expanding investment.



- 13 -
1.35        The Bank is also contributing to a UNDP-cofinanced technical
assistance program in envirormental planning, monitoring and institutional
strengthening through the Global Environmental Fund (GEF). The Bank has been
requested to assist in financing the cost of reducing pollution from selected
lignite-fired generation plants through flue gas desulphurization systems, and
through the establishment of monitorable guidelines for SO2 emissions.
1.36        The Bank is actively involved in upgrading the sector's regulatory
capabilities necessary to support expansion of private investment. MENR will in
this context carry out a study (agreed upon under the ESAL Loan) which is geared
to exploring the option of establishing an independent regulatory agency for the
subsector. The study will focus on the institutional framework needed to support
and increase regional utilities' participation in the subsector and will be
developed using the Cukurova region (entrusted region of VEAS), as a case study.
The study will define the criteria and guidelines for evaluating new investment
projects with regard to cost estimates and efficiency of the projects and will
identify issues in the process of investment allocations and investment selection
in the power subsector which will have to be addressed by the regulatory body.
Most importantly, the study will draw-up the principles for setting the exchange
tariffs between the utilities operating in the region, consistently with the
tariff reform agreed under the TEK Restructuring Project (Ln. 3345-TU) (para
4.11).
II. THE PROJECT ENTITY: GOMKUROV ELECTRIC AS.(CEAS\
A. CoXRorate Background
Introductio
2.01        QEAS is a limited liability company subject to the provisions of the
Turkish Commercial Code. Initially formed to operate the power portion of the
multipurpose Seyhan project, QEAS was granted a concession in 1953 for supplying
electricity in the Cukurova region in Southern Turkey. With the enactment of Law
30962/ in 1985, CEAS subsequently became a regional utility in 1988.   The
company's present operating decree, which expires in the year 2058, provides for
it to invest in electricity generation, transmission and distribution
installations as well as distribute electricity to consumers in its entrustment
region comprising the provinces of Adana, Mersin, Hatay as well as the Sir and
Berke Project areas in the Kahramanmaras province. The present decree also
stipulates that a major part of the company's assets would revert free to the
Government at the end of the year 2058. gEAS operates six generating plants,
including a thermal power plant, and a regional network of subtransmission
(154 kV and under) and associated substations.
2.02        QEAS presently has an authorlzed share capital of TL 300 billion
which is fully paid in. While the Government, through PPA, is the single largest
shareholder, PPA's shares account for only 11.81 of the total capital.
Individual investors, trade associations, banks and insurance companies, and
other private firms own the majority of the stock. Shareholders, by type, are
listed in Annex 2.1 and shown in Fig.2.1.  In addition, VEAS has investment
interests in three subsidiaries - KEPEZ Electric A.S.(26.68Z), CESTAS (45.89X)
and ELTEM-TEK (11X). KEPEZ is an electric utility - much like CEAS - in the
Antalya region and CESTAS is a manufacturer of electrical equipments, including
2 Law 3096 established a legal right for private companies to generate
and distribute electricity.

surge protectors and circuit breakers.
ELTEH-TEK is an engineering contractor
providing services in installation and
maintenance of power plants.   All of             rew-udali
these subsidiaries ave managed by their
own Board of Directors elected by the                /
shareholders with no interference from
QEAS t.
Existing Power FaciltiLes
2.03        At present, QEAS' installed
capacity is 581 MW, of which 475 NW (82X)            64
is hydro including the recently completed
Sir  hydroelectric  power  plant.    The
generating facilities consist of: (i) the  Figure 2.1  Sh:arholding In I as of 1991.
60 NW Seyhan hydro-electric power plant;
(ii) the 70 MW Kadincik I hydroelectric plant; (iii) the 56 MW Kadincik II
hydroelectric plant; (iv) a 106 MW oil-fired steam plant at Hersin; and (v) the
283 NW Sir hydroelectric power plant. In addition, SEAS also operates a 6 HW
hydropower station at Yuregir for which it pays an annual rental fee to DSI. In
1990, total net generation by VEAS amounted to 1058 GWh compared to the regional
electricity consumption of 3959 GWh (representing about 8X of national
electricity consumption) and a peak demand of 737 NW.
2.04        Primarily a wholesaler of electricity in the region, QEAS operates
the regional network from 154 kV down to 6 kV in the region. Altogether, as of
end 1990, CEAS owns and operates about 2500 km of subtransmission lines at 154
kV (1012 km), 66 kV (114 km), 30 kV (1290 km), 15 kV (98 km) and 6 kV (63 km).
The transformer capacity amounts to 1672 HVA spread over 27 substations.
Subtrant aission losses on §EAS' network are reasonable, amounting to about 6X of
the electricity supplied. The operation of the VEAS power system is controlled
from the dispatch center at Seyhan (para 2.16).
2.05        The 380 kV lines and substations in the Qukurova region are part of
the national power grid owned and operated by TEK. VEAS interconnects with the
380 kV grid at TEK's 380/154 kV substation at Erzin. A second inter-connection
at Adana, financed under the TEK Transmission IV Project (Ln. 2586-TU), is
expected to be commissioned in June 1992.  Also, at the 154 kV level, the
substations at Toroslar and Osmaniye provide the inter-connection between TEK and
EAS networks.   As regards distribution,  QEAS supplies directly village,
industrial and commercial users, as well as the three Distribution Enterprises
(DEs)   responsible for retail sales of electricity3/ to households in the
gukurova region which are owned and operated by TEK.
B. R2gMlatoXX Environmnt
2.06        VEAS' operations and key long-term policies are dictated to a large
degree by several public agencies in the energy sector which are mandated to
implement the various policies of the Government. The electricity tariffs to be
charged by VEAS are determined by MENR and TEK in accordance with the Government
policy to maintain electricity tariff structure and levels uniform throughout the

transferred from municipalities to TEK in 1982. At present, there are 72
distribution enterprises under TEK, one for each province.

country. The water releases for power generation are to be coordinated wlth DSI
to optimize the use of water resources. CEAS lnvestments, like all investments
in the subsector, must be approved by the SPO and MENR to ensure lntegrated
planning for least-cost expansLon of the country's power system; thelr
environmental associated aspects are regulated by the Ministry of Environment.
The financial affairs of VEAS are governed by the Turklsh Commercial Code, the
Capital Markets Law and the Capital Markets Board. Under the Capital Market Law,
passed in 1981, the Capltal Markets Board (Sermaye Piyasasi Kurulu -SPK) was
established to carry out the Government's policy of strengthening the regulation
of capital markets and protecting tha rights of investors. The SPK carries out
its mandate through regulation and supervision of public offering of securities,
stipulation of financial reporting and auditing requirements and related matters.
QEAS is thus, a regulated monopoly utility engaged in generation, transmission
and bulk distribution of electricity including trading with TEK. However, yEAS'
management is not controlled by these agencies.
2.07        In order to ensure consistent and transparent application of the
Government's policy of enhancing private sector participation in the power
subsector, MENR intends to set up an independent regulatory body.  MENR is now
in the process of recruiting consultants to assist in developLng the scope of
regulations, defining the mandate of the regulatory body, determining its
staffing needs and the related aspects4/ (para 1.25). Pending the creation of
a regulatory body, the proposed Project would address the issues of electricity
pricing and water management in so far as they bear on the viability of the
Project and yEAS.
C. Organization and Management
2.08        The present organization of QEAS is presented in Annex 2.2.  The
Board of Directors includes: a chairman; five directors representing private
stockholders have two-year terms; and three directors representing PPA have one-
year term. QEAS' Board of Directors is an elected body under the provisions of
the Turkish Commercial Code. QEAS' management, which comprises a General Manager
and six Assistant General Managers (AGM), is distinct from the Board of Directors
thus separating the policy making and policy implementing bodies of gEAS. Four
of the AGNs are for technical functions - Operations, Projects and Design, Power
Plants Installation and Planning and Coordination - and one each for Finance and
Administration. The six AGMs are supported by 21 managers and their staff.
Personnel and Staffing
2.09        gEAS' personnel policies are governed by the general Labor Law 1475,
applicable to both public and private enterprises in Turkey. Under this law, all
labor contracts are subject to collective bargaining without government
intervention. gEAS' labor force is unionized like TEK and other utilities in the
country and the relationship between management and unior. is satisfactory.
2.10.       QEAS is able to pay higher salaries and provide better benefits than
those permitted for SEEs such as TEK and has experienced low turnover of staff
4 The consultlng services would be financed from the ESAL (Ln. 2856-TU)
as agreed with the Bank. In 1991, the Government also sought the Bank's
asslstance to study and propose optlons for reforming and restructuring the
public sector (the State Owned Enterprise Sector Review). The review
recommends regulation of key sectors including the power subsector either
through one regulatory body or one for each key sector.

(less than 1.5X annually), mostly due to retirement.   The total number of
employees at the end of year 1991 was 1,490 and the classification by educational
level and technical area is shown in Table 2.1.

2.11.       QEAS has adequate training facilities for training its staff in most
areas of technical operations. In addition to in-house training, QEAS provides
external training to its staff in various functions. Technical Assistance was
provided under the ongoing Sir Hydropower Project (Ln.2750-TU) for training gEAS'
staff in load management and dispatch, project management, financial management,
manpower planning, computer systems applications, as well as for studies covering
Mersin thermal power plant rehabilitation, Kadincik II hydropower station
maintenance, power transmission and wheeling. The studies have been completed
and the recommendations implemented except for the power wheeling aspects which
are not considered practical by both TEK and QEAS.
Long-Term Planning and Investment Program
2.12.       QEAS' long-term plan is based on SPO's and TEK's detailed power
system expansion plan for the country5/.  Although QEAS does not do its own
generation planning, it prepares demand forecasts for the region, using
statistical methods to facilitate its own corporate planning. QEAS intends to
upgrade its software to adopt more sophisticated and modern tools of demand
forecasting such as the MAED model used by sro  and MENR.   As regards
transmission, detailed system master plan was developed with technical assistance
from Power Technologies Inc., USA. gEAS updates the master plan whenever major
changes occur in generation investments or in the estimated growth of demand in
the region. gEAS has installed modern tools such as the Power Systems Analysis
Package (PAP) on its computer for analyzing load flows, system stability (both
transient and steady state), short circuits, etc.
2.13.       gEAS is required to obtain approvals from the SP0 for all power
investments, except those with a rc ing of 1000 kVA or less, and from TEK on
transmission line designs.   SP0 also determines and approves the investment
incentives for QEAS6/.   These are reflected in gEAS' medium- and long-term
financial plan and annual budgets. The annual budget is considerably detailed
and is a combination of capital and operating budgets. The annual budgets are
disaggregated to monthly budgets including monthly financial statements and cash
budgets. Although, for purposes of approval by SP0 and MENR, the assumptions
dictated by the Treasury with regard to exchange rates, inflation levels and
tariff increases are used, QEAS uses different assumptions for the purposes of
5 This is done using modern planning tools such as the WEIN Automatic
System Planning (WASP-III) model based on load forecasts prepared by MENR/SPO.
6 Under the Turkish Law, a portion of a company's investments can be
deducted from income for tax purposes, as determined by SP0 for each
inlvestment. Such investment incentives are intended for promoting development
in designated areas of the country and vary from region to region.

corporate and financial planning.   Because of the consistently higher than
forecast inflation over the past few years, the budgets are continually revised
and monthly analys's of the budget covering three months - preceding, current and
following months - is presented to the Board.
Project ImDlementation Capacity
2.14.       VEAS has limited in-house but well organized project implementation
expertise. The AGM - Power Plants Construction - oversees construction of new
power plants, while the AGH - Projects and Design - oversees construction of T
& D projects as well as other projects. QEAS creates ad hoc Project Departments
to coordinate the implementation activities by drawing appropriately skilled
staff from its various departments.   For large and complicated projects,
consultants of international repute are recruited to design and carry out
construction.   QEAS successfully implemented the Bank financed Sir dam and
Hydroelectric power plant with project assistance from Coyne et Bellier, France
(C & B). VEAS has again recruited C & B as project consultants to provide the
necessary assistance to design, construct and commission the proposed Berke Dam
and Hydropower Plant (Chapter III). For all T & D projects, engineering services
including implementation, are provided by ELTEM-TEK.
OReration and Maintenance
2.15.       The AGM for operations is responsible for operation and maintenance
(O&M). The operation and maintenance department carrys out O&M activities in
generation (hydro and thermal power plants), transmission/lines and substations,
154 kV to 6 kV).   The operation of the hydro plants is under the joint
responsibility of DSI and VEAS. DSI is responsible for the operation of all dams
except Sir. The operation of the powerhouses is the responsibility of QEAS. For
the Sir dam, DSI is responsible for the water release program only. DSI cornducts
regular inspections of all dams and follows the practices of the US Bureau of
Reclamation in this respect. Annual inspections are conducted by DSI's regional
division in the territorv where the dam is located. The Mersin thermal plant is
operated by QEAS. However, the operational capacity level is determined as per
the agreement between TEK and QEAS. The maintenance programs of all power plants
are prepared by the Load Dispatch Department, while the maintenance programs of
all the substations, switching stations and transmission lines are prepared and
carried out by the Network Operation Department.   The routine maintenance
activities, which require expertise involving manufacturing and repair of
sophisticated parts, are carried out by contractors.
Load DisRatch and Management
2.16        QEAS load dispatch center at Ceyhan is old and has reached capacity
limit. In order to meet the needs of the utility in managing the expanded
generation pool as well as transmission network in the decade, a modern load
dispatch center electronically connected with the national load dispatch center
would need to be constructed. QEAS has agreed to carry out a study to determine
the location, type, size and other specifications for the proposed load dispatch
center. VEAS has agreed to complete the load dispatch center study by December
31, 1993, under terms-of-reference satisfactory to the Bank.

2.18        The regional demand for electricity grew at an annual rate of 6.2X
over the 1977-91 period, much in line with the overall growth of the same in the
country, while QEAS' generation decreased at an annual rate of -2.2%. This was
because QEAS could not expand its generation capacity in line with the demand due
to the restrictions placed on it prior to 1985 as well as to the unfavorable
hydrological conditions, especially towards the latter part of the period. Also,
VEAS could not increase thermal generation at the fuel oil-fired Mersin plant
since it is old and required extensive maintenance. QEAS is fully responsible
for ensuring supply of electricity to all customers in the region, including
TEK's DEs which account for over a third of the regional demand. In order to
meet the gap in the regional demand and its own generation, SEAS purchases power
from TEK. Such purchases increased gradually in the past but sharply over the
1987-91 period.  This is indicated by the proportion of power purchases to
demand, which increased from 14% of demand in 1977 to 64% by 1987 and to 791 in
1991. The demand forecasts for the region carried out by t;_AS estimate it to
grow at an annual rate of 6.9% over the 1991-2000 period. The commissioning of
the three units of the Sir Hydropower plant in 1991 as well as the proposed Berke
Hydropower plant in 1996/97 would enable gEAS to increase its own generation at
an annual rate of 12.5X during 1991-2000 and reduce its dependence on TEK from
79% of demand in 1991 to about 59% by 1996.
2.19        Power Exchange Agreement.  VEAS buys energy from TEK at various
interconnections with the national grid owned and operated by TEK. The amount(s)
of power/energy QEAS obtains from TEK is based on monthly load-forecasts which
are prepared by QEAS and reported to TEK, MENR and DSI detailing planned water
use at its hydro plants and required power from TEK to meet demand in the region
as well as its sales to TEK's national grid.  QEAS also supplies to the grid
small amounts of power for system considerations. The two utilities exchange
power in accordance with the provisions of the Power Exchange Agreement (PEA)
signed in 1983. The PEA, which has been revised twice since, establishes the
principles of power exchange covering such aspects as measurement of energy
transfer, operating conditions, exchange price, billing, payments, inspection,
arbitration, etc.  The PEA does not stipulate the amount(s) of energy to be
exchanged between them. This is because QEAS remains subject to load-shedding



- 19 -
measures to the same extent as other regions of the country in the event of power
shortages. Accordingly, the PEA establishes that the two utilities will apply
similar measures in the event of power shortages. QEAS has not experienced any
difficulties in obtaining power in the required amounts from TEK.  Given the
relatively high reserve margin in the system up to 1995 and the planned addition
to the system including the proposed Project, no power shortages warranting load
shedding measures are expected.
Tar,if fs
2.20        CEAS' tariff structure is similar to that of TEK's which is based on
the broad classification of consumers into categories - Industry, DEs, Villages,
Agriculture/Irrigation, Municipalities and Government Departments.   Two-part
tariffs are applicable to large a.id medium industries drawing power at the 66 kV
and above level, and consists of peak (17:00-22:00 hrs), off-peak (22:00-6:00
hrs) and day-time (6:00-17:00 hrs). In addition, demand charges and punitive
demand charges for consumption above the specified limits are applied. One-part
tariffs are applicable to all other categories of consumers. Village customers
pay at the lifeline rate regardless of consumption while the irrigation consumers
pay at 46X of the applicable rate for villages. The tariffs for DEs are set by
TEK and are linked to the average costs and revenues of TEK (paras 4.12 - 4.13).
2.21        QEAS is allowed to charge its customers in the region the same
tariffs charged by TEK in other regions. This follows from the policy of GOT to
maintain electricity tariff structure and levels uniform throughout the country
and is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. However, CEAS has no
role in setting such tariff structure or levels which are set by TEK in
conjunction with MENR and Treasury.   Following any changes or increases to
tariffs announced by TEK, VEAS applies to MENR for obtaining approval to adjust
its own structure and/or levels in line with TEK's, along with a statement
showing the impact/effect of such tariff changes on its financial situation
(Annex 2.4).
Sales. Billing and Collections
2.22        Sales and revenues by customer group for 1986 and 1990 is provided
in Annex 2.5. The textiles industry is the largest consumer (131 of sales in
1990) followed by iron and steel (11) and cement (9X). In 1990, about 901 of
sales by volume is accounted for by bulk consumers - industry (531) and TEKs a DEs
(371) - who also account for over 901 of CEAS' revenue base, 60X and 331
respectively. The annual rate of growth in consumption by industries over the
period 1986-90 was 5.81 while the same for TEK's DEs was 10.51.
2.23        Industrial customers are billed once a month and bills are delivered
immediately.     Also,   official  departments,   agriculture/irrigation  and
municipalities are billed once a month. The meters in villages are read once in
three months but are billed every mo.,th on a pro-rata basis.   Segments of
customers are billed at different dates of the month to smoothen the billing and
collection process. CEAS prepares and delivers bills to retail customers under
TEK's DEs but TEK collects the payments. Sales to TEK's DEs are netted out of
payments to TEK for power purchased and settled every month.   CEAS has a
computerized billing system. Customers can pay at any bank and a penalty of 71
per month is levied on late payments. VEAS has a good ~ollection record and its
receivables in 1990 was about one month of sales which is very satisfactory.



- 20
2.24        CEAS bills and collects from consumers, as does TEK, a number of
taxes including municipal tax (3.5X), VAT (12X), Television and Radlo Taxes (TRT
1X) and Collective Housing Fund Levy (CHFP 1O).  TRT and CHF are included in the
base tariffs and do not appear as separate items in energy bills.   After
deducting the VAT paid on its own power purchases, QEAS transfers to the
Government the VAT collected from its sales. Also, the VAT paid on purchases to
be incorporated in fixed assets is similarly recovered. Corporation tax and
other levies on CEAS' profits are assessed at 461 of taxable income base.
Investment incentives approved are deductible for tax purposes and are carried
forward for full recovery of allowed amounts. Contributions to various statutory
funds such as Defence Fund and Social Solidarity Fund are payable at 51 and 1X
of corporate tax respectively.
InsurLce
2.25        CEAS maintains fire and machinery breakdown insurance policies
covering 50X of cost on plant and equipment and 801 on inventories. Work-in-
progress is insured on all risk basis for its full value. QEAS also ensures that
contractors provide adequate insurance on all major projects and procurement.
Financial Organization
2.26        The financial management function in CEAS is headed by the AGH for
Finance who is supported by a manager and six assistant managers responsible for
General Accounting, Operations Accountsng, Investment Accounting, Tax Management,
Finance and Shares & Shareholder Relations. The finance department is adequately
staffed (36 members) with some staff having university degrees in commerce and
business management. The staff are also well trained in the use of computer
applications used by CEAS for its accounting and financial management.
Accounting Systems and Practices
2.27        CEAS' accounting systems and accounts are in accordance with the
provisions of the Turkish Commercial Code. Under the Turkish Law 2791 (1983),
concessionary companies (like QEAS and KEPEZ) and foreign companies operating in
Turkey are not allowed to revalue their fized assets. However, CEAS capitalized
up to 1984 the exchange losses on foreign loans outstanding by adding an
equivalent amount to fixed assets as allowed by the commercial code7/. This
practice was discontinued in 1984 on the recommendations of auditors (Price
Waterhouse), and only that part of the exchange losses attributable to
construction in progress has been capitalized since then, in line with
international accounting standards. QEAS now intends to revert to capitalizing
all of the foreign exchange losses on outstanding foreign loans beginning with
1991 as a means to de-facto revalue its assets, by presenting the foreign cost
portion of the asset base in revalued units. This is acceptable as long as
cumulative capitalized exchange losses do not exceed the reasonable revaluation
of fixed assets which the recent high inflation would call for, but would not be
otherwise allowed with Turkish Law. The proforma revaluation of CEAS' asset base
prepared by VEAS and the mission indicates that its revalued net fixed assets in
operation at end 1990 was TL 152 billion (US$52 million equivalent) compared with
unrevalued TL 70 billion (US$23 million).   In order to compensate for the
7 The Turkish Commercial Code allows capitalizing or expensing the
foreign exchange losses each year at the option of the company.



- 21 -
stipulation that a major part of the assets should be transferred to the
Government at the end of the concession agreement, VEAS is granted an additional
annual amortization on its capital for tax purposes. Other legal reserves are
also appropriated from statutory profits which may be used to absorb losses.
Audit
2.28        In addition to a Board of Auditors required by the law, QEAS has
established an internal audit wing reporting directly to the General Manager.
The audit wing is staffed with two professionals, one each for financial and
technical audit, and headed by a manager.   The technical audit covers all
technical and related operational aspects; and the financial audit covers only
procedural compliance with organizational policies and practices for internal
control rather than compliance with accounting principles and policies.  The
Turkish commercial code requires that the annual financial report be submitted
by mid-March, two weeks prior to the annual shareholders meeting. The Board of
Auditors performs the financial audit regularly during the year.  Also, the
auditors representing the Treasury carry out audit of large investments to
determine compliance with regulations.
2.29        For companies whose shares are traded on the stock exchanges in the
country, the Capital Market Law requires an independent financial audit by firms
registerod with the Capital Market Board.  Accordingly, CEAS recruited Price
Waterhouse of Turkey to conduct such audit.  SEAS has submitted to the Bank
satisfactory audit reports prepared by Price Waterhouse as agreed under the
ongoing Sir Hydropower Project (Lra.2750-TU). With the expiry of the six-year
term of the audit contract with Price Waterhouse (last audit for 1991), VEAS
intends to recruit another firm, approved by the Capital Market Board and
acceptable to the Bank, to conduct the audit of its accounts beginning with the
fiscal year 1992.  QEAS has agreed to carry out the financial audit of its
accounts for each year beginning with 1992 accounts, including project accounts,
by private auditors under terms-of-reference satisfactory to the Bank,and submit
the audit reports to the Bank within six months after the end of the fiscal year.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Proiect Setting
Overview
3.01        The Government's strategy in the power subsector during the Sixth-
Five Year Plan as embedded in the power generation expansion plan calls for
further exploitation of domestic resources, particularly hydro potential for
power generation in preference to lignite base generation (which is subject to
environmental constraint). In addition, the strategy aims at expanding private
sector participation in the subsector. Given the constraints in public financing
and the delays encountered in the fruition on the BOT proposals, the proposed
Project needE to be completed as planned in order to reduce the risks of power
shortages toward the end of the decade. QEAS, a private utility, is well placed
to implement the proposed Project.
3.02        Turkey's main domestic sources of energy are hydro potential and
lignite deposits. The exploitable hydro power potential is estimated at about
31 GW with average annual generation about 122 TWh, of which 7.5 GW has been
developed. gukurova region's hydro potential has been estimated at about 3.9 GW
with average annual generation of about 12 TWh. The region's existing hydro



- 22 -
generation capacity is 721 KW of which 475 MW is owned and operated by QEAS.
About 697 NW are under construction by DSI.  The proposed Berke Hydro Power
Project would exploit a further 510 MW of hydro potential.   This would
substantially increase EAS' generation capacity and help CEAS cover more than
one-half its final sales by self generation.
RAtionale for Bank Involvement
3.03        The Bank's involvement would support GOT's strategy of mobilizing
private funds for the power sector. The delays being experienced in establishing
BOT schemes have escalated the pressure on GOT for ensuring that the proposed
Project is implemented without delay. The proposed Loan would secure resources
on terms and conditions suited for long-gestation investment. Private resources,
which would not otherwise be available without Government guarantee, are to be
mobilized by IFC while the Bank would provide the additional funds needed to meet
the  foreign costs.    Further,  the  Bank"s  involvement would  ensure  that
environmental and resettlement concerns are properly addressed.
Project Objectives
3.04        The proposed Project would assist the Government in: (a) accelerating
the development of hydro potential; and (b) expanding the role of the private
sector in power generation, thereby alleviating the pressure on the public sector
for mobilizing the financial resources.
Project Descriptio'
3.05        The Project consists of the following components:
(a)   Construction of a thin concrete double curvature dam (201 m high
above the foundation and with a crest length of 270 m), including
grout and drainage curtains at Berke on the Ceyhan River to form a
gross storage reservoir capacity of 427 million mi, tunnel and
surface spillways, bottom outlets, intake structures with a 2,050 m
long and 9.3 m in diameter headrace tunnel, a horizontal steel-lined
tunnel (41 m long), a surge tank (20 i in diameter, 90 m high), an
underground power house (25 m long, 19.75 m wide and 33.5 m high)
with three 187.5 NVA vertical Francis type turbine generators and
their power step-up transformers, and a switchyard with an outdoor
double busbar type switchgear;
(b)   subtransmission  lines  (737 km) and substation  facilities  (12
substations with installed capacity of 1,350 MVA) in order to
transmit the energy generated by Berke to load centers and expand
the 154 kV system to meet the forecasted demand in the QEAS service
area and regional dispatch center;
(c)   technical assistance for studies related to the regional dispatch
center installation and operation, training and procurement of the
special equipment; and
(d)   The  project  includes  a program  to  resettle  or provision  to
indemnify, as required, 144 people affected by the project,
including provision of alternative adequate housing and other
community and infrastructure facilities.



- 23 -
A full description of the project components is provided in Annexes 3.1, 3.2 and
3.3 respectively.
Project Origin
3.06        The proposed Berke Dam and reservoir are situated along a 35 km
segment of the Ceyhan River. The project area lies in the south Anatolia region
within the provinces of Kahramanmaras and Adana. The project site lies within
a narrow, steep-sided canyon between two existing dam/reservoir systems: one
located immediately upstream at Sir, and the other 2 km downstream at Aslantas.
The Berke project is close to transmission lines associated with the Sir and
Aslantas power plants.
3.07        The Berke hydroelectric project has long been considered an important
potential source of electricity to the region and has been the subject of a
series of feasibility studies (IECO, 1966; OTCA, 1969; Temelsu, 1978
Energoproject,  1984;  C&B/Aknil  1990).    Of  the  31  existing  or proposed
hydroelectric projects identified in the VEAS service area, the Berke project
provides the highest installed capacity. Furthermore, many features of the site
make it ideal for the generation of hydro-electricity: the steep hydraulic
gradient, its location between two existing reservoirs, the proximity to existing
transmission lines, the relatively small area to be inundated for the reservoir,
and the paucity of settlements and arable land within this area. A detailed
water resources development master plan (IECO, 1966) was prepared for the Ceyhan
River Basin in 1966 which proposed a series of dams and reservoirs along the
length of the Ceyhan River for water supply, irrigation and hydroelectricity.
Eight out of a total of twenty-seven projects have been completed to date and the
remainder are projected to be completed within the next 20 to 30 years. The
Berke hydroelectric project was one of the projects identified in the IECO master
plan. The design of the proposed Berke hydroelectric project has undergone a
number of transformations since its initial conception to accommodate physical
constraints of the site.
3.08        The first Berke feasibility study, conducted for DSI by IECO in 1966,
envisaged two alternative layouts: either a high dam (207 m) situated at the
Berke site with a powerhouse located immediately downstream, or a run-of-river
dam located further upstream with a 9340 m power tunnel which would relay the
water to a power plant located slightly upstream of the Berke site. This second
alternative was designed in the event that a high dam in karstic limestone might
cause  leakages  (IECO,  1966).   In 1969,  the Japanese Overseas Technical
Cooperation Agency (OTCA) was commissioned by DSI to evaluate the project. Their
report concluded that a 310 meter high dam could be constructed at the Berke site
without inducing leakage into adjacent valleys. No significant karstification
was observed at the dam s'.te and the OTCA report indicated that any foreseeable
problems could be resolved by means of grout curtains (OTCA, 1969). The project
was reevaluated again in 1979, this time at the request of the Electric Work
Administration (EIE), by the firms Temeslu and Energoproject, who designed a run-
of-the river dam at Duzkesme, a 13.8 km power tunnel and a power station at Berke
(Temelsu, 1978; Energoproject, 1984). Although the Duzkesme-Berke scheme did not
make full use of the available head between Sir and Aslantas, this layout was
proposed because of concerns about leakage from a high dam located at the Berke
site.
3.09        As the project preparation progressed, however, it became evident
that there were a number of problems associated with construction of the 13.8 km
tunnel. Unfavorable geologic conditions raised serious questions about the time
and cost required for tunnel construction. Furthermore, the tunnel diameter was



- 24 -
limited by economic considerations, which in turn, limited the installed capacity
of the project. When further geological studies at the Berke site indicated that
risks of leakage were limited, the Duzkesme-Berke design was abandoned in favor
of the project described herein. The firm of Coyne et Bellier and Aknil were
commissioned in December 1988 by VEAS to draw up, under a grant from the French
Government, the feasibility study of this project.   During the planning and
design phase, a number of different alternatives were evaluated, including the
type of dam, height and design capacity, and the layout of the hydraulic conducts
and power station.
B. Technical Evaluation
The Dam and the Powerhouse
3.10        Zhe Bank's experts reviewed the available information on: (a) geology
of the dam site; (b) the slope and stability around the reservoir area; (c) water
tightness; (d) foundation treatment; (e) drainage and grout curtains;
(f) seismicity; (g) hydrology; (h) geology of the headrace tunnel and underground
powerhouse sites; (i) availability of suitable construction materials; and
(j) instrumentation and safety of the dam. The dam site is uniquely attractive
for an arch dam, and for the layout of the project permanent structures. The
layout of structures including the main arch dam, the downstream lower arch dam,
coffer dams, headrace tunnel, surge tank, spillway tunnels, diversion tunnel,
penstocks, underground powerhouse, etc., have been carefully studied on the basis
of: (i) geological conditions, (ii) rock bedding planes, (iii) comparative
advantage, and (iv) suitability and ease of access and construction. The Bank's
experts are in general agreement with proposed layout of structures, and in
particular: (a) all permanent structures (intake structures, headrace tunnel,
surge tank, spillway tunnels, penstalks, and underground power house) being
located on right abutment, and (b) the powerhouse located downstream along with
a long tunnel instead of adjacent to dam, for increased generation and avoiding
the technical concerns of the possibility of left bank slide, and blockage of the
tail race. An independent international Panel of Experts (POE) has already been
associated with the project and the layout of structures has duly been concurred
by the POE.   All the members of the POE are well known in their fields of
expertise and they also worked for the Bank financed Sir arch dam (very
successfully completed upstream of Berke dam).
Transmission
3.11        The Berke Hydro Power Plant switchyard will be connected to the 154
kV gukurova Regional Transmission System, which is connected to 380 kV National
Grid System. The project includes about 750 km of transmission lines and about
1,350 MVA of transformer capacities at VEAS' substations, as well as regional
dispatch center.   The attachment to Annex 3.2 gives the breakdown of these
facilities. This would adequately meet VEAS' requirement up to 2000.
Technical Assistance
3.12        Technical assistance proposed for the project includes:
(a)   study of existing regional dispatch center and requirements for the
period till 2010;
(b)   training for VEAS staff in the area of local dispatch; and
(c)   special equipment regarding training under (b).



- 25 -
QEAS would prepare and submit to the Bank for a reiLaw (a) terms of reference
for the load dispatch center study; (b) a proposal for t'ie training program and
curriculum vitae of the staff to be involved in training activities; and
(c) technical specification and cost estimates for the speeial equipment.
Status of Project Preraration
3.13        Project preparation activities are at an advanced stage.   The
following summarizes the status of project preparation:
(a)   Project Management:  gEAS has already appointed the Project Manager
and the essential support staff for the dam and powerhouse.
(b)   Engineering and Supervision Consultants:  In consultation with the
Bank, QEAS has appointed the engineering firm of Coyne at Bellier
(C&B) on the sole source basis for detailed design of the project
and preparation of main civil works and E&M equipment bidding
documents, and also to assist SEAS for construction supervision.
VEAS has already established the independent international Panel of
Expert (POE) for the dam and powerhouse.
(c)   Project Design:   C&B has completed the detailed engineering and
design for the dam and powerhouse.    The  transmission  lines,
substations and load dispatch center components of the Project will
be finalized in accordance to the Project implementation timetable.
(d)   PreRaratory Works:    In order to provide basic  infrastructure
facilities at the dam and powerhouse sites, VEAS has already awarded
contracts for:
- access roads, tunnels and bridges
- exploratory galleries
- diversion tunnel
_ camps
- communication system
- supply of energy
Most of the access roads, appurtenances and structures and the
proposed areas for screening and crushing plants have already been
completed. The bridges on the upstream and downstream access roads
are also completed.   Extensive progress has been made on the
diversion tunnel construction on the left bank which is scheduled to
be completed before the award of the main civil works contract. All
temporary and permanent camps for the engineers and VEAS have been
completed and offices and other relevant buildings are scheduled to
be completed also before the award of the main civil works contract.
In addition, QEAS, in consultation with the Bank, has prequalified
to joint ventures which participated in pre-bid conference and will
be submitting bids for the main civil works contract.
(e)   Land Acquisition:    VEAS has  agreed  to  a  schedule  for  land
acquisition and the land required for the start-up of the project
has already been acquired.
(f)   Environmental Assessment ReRort (EA) and Resettlement Plan:  The
Environmental Assessment report and Resettlement Plan have already
been completed and distributed.

The base project cost is in January, 1991 prices as estimated by C&B and VEAS and
reviewed by the Bank. The cost estimates do not include import duties and taxes
as QEAS will be exempt from such duties and taxes on this project. Although VEAS
will pay Value Added Tax (VAT) on the expenditures for the Project, the amounts
paid would subsequently be recovered by VEAS and therefore, VAT is not included
in the project cost in Table 3.1. Overall physical contingencies of about 51
have been added except for the civil works component for which 15X physical
contingencies have been included. Similarly, specific allowances of 51 have been
included for the hydraulic and electromechanical equipment.   The overall
contingencies and specific allowances are considered adequate. An exchange rate
of US$1 - 2,933 TL (January 1991) has been used. The relatively lower price
contingencies is due to the relatively shorter construction period of 41 years
(para 3.29).  Price escalation contingencies have been calculated on the basis
of March 1992 forecasts (EClCO) for domestic and international inflation.
Project Financing PLan
3.15        The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 3.2.  The
total foreign cost of the Project including interest during construction,
US$370.2 million, is proposed to be financed by a Bank loan to the Republic of
Turkey on standard country lending terms and Cofinancing (para 4.18). The Bank
funds would be onlent to QEAS under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement on terms
satisfactory to the Bank, with CEAS bearlng the foreign exchange and the interest
risk on the Bank loan, as well as an on-lending fee equivalent to 35 basis points
p.a. to be charged by the Treasury. The Bank Loan would finance: (a) 601 of cost
of civil works; (b) 1001 of forelgn cost and 1001 local ex-factory cost of supply
of materlal and equipment and 201 of installation costs; and (c) 1001 of
consultancy services. In view of the considerable foreign exchange cash flow
needs during the construction period of the Project, the loan amount would also



- 27 -
cover the interest during construction of the Bank Loan (para 4.19). The local
costs (US$253.5 million equivalent excluding the investment made during 1989-91),
will be financed from internal cash generation and new share capital issues. The
execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between GOT and SEAS, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, is set as a condition of effectiveness of
the proposed Loan.

Retroactive Financing
3.16        In order  to maintain the time  schedule  of the Project,  the
procurement process for the main civil works was carried out in conjunction with
the Bank's appraisal and the contract is planned to be awarded by end June 1992,
when all preparatory works are expected to be completed. Therefore, retroactive
financing of about US$20 million would be allowed to cover eligible expenditures
and advance payment to the civil works contractor (the foreseen loan signing is
June 1992).
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement Aspects
3.17        All Bank-financed procurement for civil works,  and supply and
installation of material and equipment would be accordir.n to the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines. Hiring of consultant's services would be done according
to the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants.
Bank-Financed Procurement
3.18        International Competitive Bidding (ICB) according to the Bank's
procurement guidelines would be followed for the following, except technical
assistance:
(a)   civil works - dam, powerhouse and associated structures (excluding
river diversion tunnel and preparatory works);
(b)   hydromechanical equipments;
(c)   transmission lines - supply and erection of towers; supply of
conductors, accessories, insulators and hardware;
(d)   substations  - supply and installation of switchgear equipment
including cables and transformers;



- 28 -
(e)   load dispatch center - supply of equipment and installation; and
(f)   technical assistance - load dispatch center study, special equipment
and training.
It is likely that domestic manufacturers will submit bids against items (b)
through (e). In case a contract is awarded to domestic manufacturers, the Bank
would finance the ex-factory amount of the contract.   Qualifying domestic
manufacturers will receive preference in bid evaluation of 15X or the prevailing
import duty, whichever is lower. Consultancy services and staff training would
be procured according to the Bank guidelines. Details are provided in Annex 3.3.
3.19        International shopping according to the Bank's Guidelines would be
used for procurement of certain auxiliary equipment, tools, etc. Procurement
following the international shopping method would involve obtaining offers from
at least three suppliers from three different countries - - such procurement being
limited to US$50,000 per contract and US$300,000 in the aggregate.   Direct
contracting following the Bank's Procurement Guidelines would be used for special
equipment. Total foreign expenditure under this procedure would be limited to
about US$300,000.
3.20        A Country Procurement Assessment Report has not yet been completed.
However, during negotiations, agreements have been reached that for the Bank-
financed contracts SEAS will follow the Bank Procurement Guidelines. Bank loan
proceeds will not be used for financing contracts procured through LCB.
Non-Bank Financed Procurement
3.21        The Bank would not finance the cost of the preparatory works and
supply and installation of material and equipment procured according to Local
Competitive bidding procedures for the following: (a) river diversion tunnel;
(b) the owners camp; and (c) materials and equipment for transmission lines and
substations.  Local shopping procedures would be used for: (a) miscellaneous
civil works; (b) temporary bridge and site access roads; (c) miscellaneous boring
and drilling required for the site investigation; and (d) engineering consultants
for the engineering and supervision during construction of civil works,
transmission lines and substations. These would be financed by QEAS. Land for
the project would be acquired according to the laws of the country. Procurement
for the electromechanic equipment, electrical equipment, general expenditures
will be done according to IFC procedure. Also, it is expected that consultancy
services of C&B would be financed by IFC.

Disbursement AsRects
3.23             The  proceeds  of  the  loan would be  disbursed  over  six  years  (1992-
1997) on the following basis:
(a)    60X of the total costs of the civil works;
(b)     10OZ of the foreign cost and 1001 of local ex-factory cost of supply
of    electromechanical,    powerhouse    and    switchyard    equipment,
hydromechanical equipment and supply of material and equipment for
the transmission lises and substations, and 20X of installation
costs;
(c)     100l   of the  foreign cost of training for QEAS  staff;  and



- 30
(d)   lOOX of consultancy services.
SRecial Account
3.24        The disbursement schedule (Annex 3.5) follows the Bank's standard
disbursement profile for the region's power projects. A special account for QEAS
with initial deposits of US$15 million will be established at a commercial bank
or with the Central Bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The
Bank would also permit the use of statements of expenditure on contracts valued
at US$200,000 or less to assist VEAS in making timely payments to the
contractors. QEAS would retain the supporting documents and make them available
for inspection by Bank supervision missions and by external auditors. Except in
cases of direct payments, no reimbursement applications for less than US$200,000
would be accepted. An audit of the special account would be carried out by
independent auditors and the audit report would be submitted to the Bank within
nine months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition to the audit of the
Special Account by the Central Bank's audit department as required by Turkish
Law, the private auditors who would be contracted to audit VEAS' annual accounts
(para 2.28), would prepare a special report to include a statement verifying the
amounts disbursed against the SOEs. The Loan Closing Date would be December 31,
1997.
E. Project Implementation Aspects
Engineering Consultants
3.25        Based on a contract with QEAS signed in July 1990, C&B is responsible
for: (i) preparation of the bid documents; (ii) assisting QEAS in examination and
evaluation of the bids received; and (iii) inspection of equipment during
manufacture; and (iv) providing advice to QEAS' project team on engineering and
teclnical supervision during construction and commissioning. C&B has completed
the detailed design of the project. Assurances would be obtained that CEAS would
continue to employ C&B engineering consultants throughout the period of
construction and commissioning. This contract is proposed to be financed from
IFC or VEAS' own resources.
Organization and Management
3.26        CEAS has already appointed the Project Manager and the essential
support staff at its headquarters. In addition, VEAS would also have a site
organization consisting of a chief site engineer assisted by civil, electrical,
mechanical engineers and surveyors. The QEAS project team would be assisted by
the engineering consultants in inspection of the equipment during manufacture and
in supervision of the dam and the powerhouse during construction and
commissioning. CEAS would establish a laboratory at site for testing of the
civil construction materials, an essential requirement for the quality control
during construction of the thin arch concrete dams.
3.27        Implementation of transmission lines, substations and technical
assistance would be the responsibility of CEAS  Project Planning and Construction
Divisions. QEAS has ample experience in procuring materials and equipment for
its subtransmission lines and substations. It also has adequate experience in
engineering and supervlsion during construction and commissioning for
transmission facilities. However, considering the extent of the work involved,
it proposes to appoint engineering consultants for the load dispatch center study
and transmission and subtransmission lines according to the Bank's Guidelines.



- 31
Implementation Schedules and Project CompIetion Date
3.28        The construction schedule for the Project  (shown by major bid
packages in Annex 3.6) foresees project completion by the end of 1996.  The
activities connected with transmission lines and substations would be coordinated
to enable power generated at the Berke Dam to be effectively utilized by the load
centers in the QEAS service area.   QEAS, therefore, reasonably expects the
project to be commissioned in last quarter of 1996. However, on the basis of the
experience reflected in the Bank's disbursement profile of power projects, the
disbursement could be expected to complete about a year later. The loan closing
date, therefore, would be December 31, 1997. A 4h year construction schedule
appears quite realistic based on the following factors: (a) easy access to dam
site from highway; (b) completion of the primary access road to dam site and
other preparatory works (including the upstream and downstream bridges) in
advance; and (c) completion of the diversion tunnel before the award of the main
civil works contract.
Progress Reports
3.29        To monitor the progress of the Project and permit its evaluation on
completion, QEAS would maintain records on the matters shown in the Project
Monitoring Guidelines in Annex 3.8 and submit a quarterly progress report to the
Bank.  On completion of the Project, VEAS would prepare a project completion
report.
DeveloRment of Ceyhan River Basin and Uater Manag:ement
3.30        The proposed Berke dam and power plant would be built on the Ceyhan
river on which other dams and power houses already exist.  The upstream Menzelet
and the downstream Aslantas dam are multi-purpose projects including flood
control, water supply, irrigation and power generation.  The dams are operated
by DSI while the power plants are operated by TEK. The Sir dam and power house,
situated midstream between Menzelet and Aslantas, are exclusively for power
generation and operated by CEAS, as would be the proposed Berke dam and power
house (which would be downstream of Sir).  The management and distribution of
water resources in Turkey is administered by the General Directorate of State
Hydraulic Works (DSI) under the Ministry of Public Works and Settlements.
Prir.rities for water use have been established, in order of decreasing importance
as follows: flood control, potable water supplies, irrigation and hydropower.
This ranking reflects the importance of irrigated agriculture in Turkey's long-
term  development  plans.    A water  resources  development master plan was
commissioned by DSI for the Ceyhan, Seyhan, Berdan, Develi and Amik Basins and
was completed in 1966  (IECO,  1966).   This document proposed a series of
irrigation and hydropower projects in the Ceyhan River Basin, many of which have
been completed or are in the process of construction. Although the timing and
some of the details of this original master plan have changed over the years, the
basic development plan has been followed to a large degree. The volume of water
diverted from the river for agricultural purposes will increase by four times by
the year 2023, with the largest volume diverted to the Amik Plains irrigation
project. The project involves the irrigation of 105,434 ha and will require an
annual water withdrawal of 658 Mm3 from the Menzelet reservoir, which is located
upstream of the Sir Hydro Power Project.
3.31        The Berke dam and powerhouse has been designed based on confirmed
data by DSI on water flows and developmental plans for the Ceyhan river basin.
Accordingly, the generation from the proposed Project is estimated to be an
annual average of 1,660 GWh from 1997 decreasing gradually due to upstream



- 32
development, and stabilizing at 1,100 GWh/year after 2023, the year when the
upstream development is planned to be completed. In order to ensure viability
of the Project, confirmation from DSI of the assumptions on planned upstream
development for the Ceyhan river basin on which the design and feasibility of the
proposed Project is based has been received. The Bank's review indicates that
some of the upstream irrigation projects are substantially behind schedule and
that accelerated development of these projects would not be detrimental to the
expected generation from the proposed Project.
3.32        The current practices in water management are not codified, but are
based on bilateral interactions between the parties involved. Since the Ceyhan
river water system presents a rather unique pattern of water sharing across
different users and purposes, no existing arrangements can be replicated to
optimize the Ceyhan river's water uses. Accordingly, a detailed study examining
the optimal utilization of water across all the parties involved (namely DSI,
gEAS and MENR), with the active participation of DSI and gEAS would be carried
out.  The study will also focus on rules and regulations to be adopted for
sharing of water, especially under extreme circumstances and will be financed by
a Japan Grant Facility (JGF) arranged by the Bank. It is expected that the study
will be completed by Tuly 1993.
Land Acguisition and Resettlement
3.33        The law and procedures relating to resettlement have been reviewed
and are considered to contain adequate provisions to protect the rights of the
population to be resettled. Land needed for public purposes may be acquired
compulsorily in Turkey in accordance with the Expropriation Law of 1983. This
is a three-step procedure. Firstly, the Project agency offers to purchase the
land from the landowner through normal negotiations for the sale and purchase of
land. In the event the landowner does not wish to sell, a notice is filed for
compulsory acquisition in the public interest pursuant to the 1983 Expropriation
Law. Under the Law, a permanent committee in each province- -consisting of local
representatives, land experts and members of the administration--determines the
value of land in such cases. Land valueq are determined at market value. In the
event there is disagreement, the third s:ep is to take the matter to the courts.
There are, in addition, procedures for resettlement of displaced populations.
Landowners are given the option either to be resettled or to take cash
compensation. Usually, it is the Resettlement Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs (MAFRA) that makes available other land
for displaced populations. The cost of resettlement is borne by the project
agency.   Current resettlement procedures specify that dam construction and
resettlement should be carried out in a coordinated manner and that priority
should be given to the resettlement of people whose land would be submerged due
to dam construction.
3.34        The Berke Dam reservoir covers about 7.8 km2 of surface area and
would affect four settlements having 144 inhabitants in 18 houses which are
mostly built with sun-dried bricks, stones and briquettes, and 23 other
buildings. The farms in the reservoir area consist of small scattered pieces of
land and their produce is mostly for their own consumption. About 60 hectares
of land that is cultivated will be submerged under the reservoir. gEAS would
acquire the necessary land in accordance with the resettlement plan (paras 3.37
and 3.40).
3.35        The above figures appear to be extremely low compared to those for
comparable schemes:  Table 3.4 provides the results of the calculation of a
rating equal to the number of people displaced from a dam reservoir area in order



- 33
to produce one GWh per year. This shows a ratio 80 times lower at Berke than at
Sir, 1,500 times lower than for the Nangbeto scheme in Togo, which was
commissioned in 1989.

3.36       After the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources declared the
project of public interest in a letter of July 3, 1989, gukurova Elektrik A.S.
asked the Kahramanmaras Regional Directorate for Rural Services, who are legally
in charge of resettlement, to ask the families living in the homes within the
limits of the future reservoir if they wished to be resettled or not.  All
families have opted for compensation. A resettlement plan prepared by gEAS has
been reviewed by the Bank.
3.37       The Kalender cemetery is located within the limits of the future
reservoir.    The Department  of Religious Affairs of  the Governorate  of
Kahramanmaras, consulted in 1986 with respect to the cemeteries that were to
disappear under Sir reservoir, responded that the cemeteries could remain under
water, or could be relocated, but only as a whole. The Imam of Muratli issued
the same opinion about the Kalender cemetery. VEAS will relocate the Kalender
cemetery, and/or build a new one, if so desired by the populations.
3.38       An important thermal source, the Ilica hot spring, is located 1.8 km
downstream of the site. The Ilica thermal installations have already been closed
for a season to allow for the preparatory work for the construction of the dam
to be carried out. SEAS therefore rented the installations for the season in
order to close them. The municipality of Duzici received complaints from Ilica's
patrons. The thermal baths will have to be closed again during the period of
excavation of the outlet structures (4-15 months or. the construction schedule)
and'during the period of construction of these structures (25-39 months on the
construction schedule).
3.39       According to the municipality of Duzici, the economic impact of a
temporary shut-down of the thermal baths is limited. Patrons will be redirected



- 34 -
towards the hot springs of Ciftehan, which is located 110 km to the northwest of
Adana. Appropriate agreements have been obtained from GOT and QEAS to ensure
that resettlement is carried out in a manner satisfactory to the Bank.
F. Environmental AsRects
3.40        Coyne and Bellier, Paris, conducted a study of the environmental
impact of the Berke dam. The draft report has been submitted to the Bank and
reviewed by the Environment Department. The comments have been incorporated into
the final report. The report elaborates the following impact:
Physical Environment
3.41        The possibility of leakage from the reservoir to the low-lying Sabun
Suyu and Andirin River valleys was discounted due to the presence of geologic and
hydrologic barriers between the reservoir and these valleys. Leakage within the
Ceyhan River valley itself is precluded by the presence of impermeable geologic
strata complemented by grout curtains. In evaluating the ability of the dam to
withstand earthquakes, two alternative methodologies were used: a probalistic
approach (Cornell-McGuire) and a deterministic approach (ICOLD). The results of
the two analyses were in close agreement, and led to a peak soil acceleration of
190 cm/s2 for the Basic Design Earthquake, and 300 cm/s2 for the Maximum probable
Earthquake. An independent review of dam safety was provided by the members of
QEAS' Panel of International Experts. Impacts of a catastrophic failure of the
Berke dam were evaluated on the Aslantas dam, Kayraktepe Aslantas National Park
and on dwellings located near the reservoir.   Temporary overtopping is the
primary risk for the Aslantas dam. The likelihood of overtopping depends on the
water level in the Aslantas reservoir at the time of rupture and the speed with
which the spillway gates at Aslantas can be opened. Reactivation of the landslide
located immediately downstream of the dam would have no serious consequences on
the Project. The sedimentation rate for the Berke reservoir was calculated at
the low figure of 180,000 m* per year. Because of the relatively small size and
great depth of the Berke reservoir, the volume of water lost from the river
system due to evaporation is relatively low (0.21 of the total annual flow).
Impounding should have no impact on the Ilica thermal springs, since it is not
connected to the ground-water system in the vicinity of the proposed reservoir.
The project is included as a component of the Ceyhan River Master Plan.
Biological Environment
3.42        Construction of the dam will result in the inundation of a 7.8 km2
area, which include pine and oak forest, mediterranean macchia formation, and
little agricultural land. Additional areas of vegetation will be disturbed at
the construction sites for the dam, access roads, power house, etc. As none of
the endemic species identified in the area are restricted to elevation of less
than the 345 m maximum rese,voir elevation, none of them will undergo the total
loss of their habitat.   A Land Cover Management Plan will be developed and
implemented for the intermediate watershed. Objectives of the Plan include the
maintenance of existing vegetation communities for the purpose of Biological
diversification.   Microclimatic changes in the immediate vicinity of the
reservoir will enhance plant growth.  The inundation and disturbance of the
vegetative commun..ties described above will result in the displacement of
associated fauna.   If reservoir filling takes place in the winter, dormant
species may be drowned. Although the creation of the reservoir may disturb the
migration routes of some mammals, it may create new habitat types for water
dependent species.

Socio-economic Envlironment
3.43        Only 144 persons live within the limits of the future reservoir.  If
they so desire, they will be resettled by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Affairs.   The reservoir location and the fast regression of malaria in the
province of Adana make it likely that the impoundment will not favor water-borne
diseases.   The implementation of actions identified in the Environmental
Assessment will prevent the region from becoming a new malaria focus. The Ilica
thermal springs which are located near the site will have to be closed during
part of the construction period, and will be renovated by the Province of Adana
and QEAS. Some footpaths and mule passages across the Ceyhan River will be cut
by the creation of the reservoir. Communication will be reestablished by means
of a boat service. CEAS has already rehabilitated the road which leads to the
Ceyhan from the future Adana-Gaziantep freeway, and has built a permanent bridge
over the river. This construction will provide a new way to travel between
Duzici and Andirin when the link is completed north of the river to Andirin.
This will bring the latter closer to markets and will have a considerable
positive impact on the economy of the region.   The provision of additional
community facilities and services is not necessary to accommodate construction
and operation employees or relocatees becas e constructionl employees will be
housed in self-contained camps, total operation employment is small (150
employees) and relocation impacts a total of 144 people, who will take up now
residence in six different locations.
Mitigation and Monitoring Plans
3.44        CEAS will accomplish the activities summarized in the tables given
as Annex 3 and coordinate the activities of the other implementing groups. The
report states that the overall long-term environmental impact is positive.
Appropriate agreements have been obtained from GOT and gEAS to ensure that the
mitigation and monitoring measures are carried out in a manner satisfactory to
the Bank.
Transmission Lines Environmental Review
3.45        A transmission line environmental review (ER) (Category  'B') would
be carried out by consultants under TOR satisfactory to the Bank. The ER would
be financed from the Japan Grant Facility arranged by the Bank for that purpose.
gEAS has agreed to complete the ER for transmission lines by December 31, 1992,
and implement the recommended measures to mitigate environmental impact in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank.
G. Dam Safety Aspects
3.46        In accordance with the Bank guidelines for safety of dams (OMS 3.80,
1977), the project provides for the following specific safety measures to ensure
safety of the proposed Berke dam:
ZngLnugX1u
3.47        Coyne et Bellier (C&B), a well known engineering firm with extensive
experience in arch dAms, has been engaged by gEAS for detailed designs of the
project and preparation of contract documents and also to assist QEAS for
construction supervision.

International Panel of Experts
3.48        An independent Panel of International Experts has already been
established to carry out a comprehensive review of the designs and/or completed
works of the dam and related structures with the objective of advising and
ascertaining on the safety of the dam and the appurtenant structures, with
detailed consideration of the structural, geologic, hydraulic, soil mechanics and
the seismic aspects. The Panel comprises of four well known experts (acceptable
to the Bank) with relevant expertise in dam engineering (including engineering
geology, rock mechanics, dam design, tunnelling and dam construction). The Panel
would meet often enough for it to guide and advise in time on the designs,
construction and the safety aspects of the dam. QEAS will keep the Bank informed
about the schedule of the Panel meetings and submit copy of each panel report to
the Bank. Bank will participate in the panel meetings as and when convenient.
Instrumentation
3.49        Extensive instrumentation (including pendulums, extensometers, joint
measurement devices and seismographs) is proposed to be installed at Berke dam
for dam safety monitoring. The same will be further reviewed by the panel and
the Bank experts for its adequacy when instrumentation design are finalized
during construction and additional instrumentation will be incorporated (if
considered essential). The proposed instrumentation would provide handy tools
for studying the behavior of the dam and foundations after construction and for
timely requisite protective measures to control undesirable developments or
emergency conditions.
Dam Safety Insgections during Operation
3.50        DSI conducts regular inspections of all dams in the country and
generally follows the practices of the US Bureau of Reclamation in this respect.
Annual dam safety inspections are conducted by the DSI's Regional Division in
whose territory the dam is located.   VEAS has confirmed the details of the
arrangement with DSI for inspection of the dam during operation.  The dam safety
inspections by DSI as an independent agency would be acceptable to the Bank.
3.51        All works completed under the project including the dam, powerhouse,
allied structures, mechanical and electrical equipment, residential quarters, and
access roads and bridges would be maintained by VEAS. Assurances have been
obtained from QEAS that all the structures and other works constructed under the
project would be maintained by QEAS in accordance with sound engineering
practices.
H. Benefits and Risks
3.52        The measurable benefits attributable to the proposed Project include
incremental generation of electricity along the least-cost path with no claims
on GOT's budget for the domestic financing of the project.   An additional
important benefit is the demonstration effect expected to derive from the success
of the expansion of VEAS's scope of activities, effectively cooperating with TEK
and DSI in Turkey's power subsector.   The main risks envisaged are the
possibility of construction delays derived from construction site conditions as
well as the size of the project. This risk is substantially reduced since QEAS
has appointed consultants of proven competence, to assist in design and
engineering as well as implementation,

IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. Introduction
4.01        The financial affairs of VEAS are governed by the Turkish Commercial
Code,  the Capital Markets Law and the Capital Markets Board (SPK).   The
accounting system and the related policies are stipulated by the Turkish
Commercial Code, while the financial market operations are regulated by the SPK.
Further, QEAS' dividend policy is geared to the statutory stipulation set by SPK.
Despite constrained autonomy (para 2.06;, QEAS is an efficiently managed utility
that has a long history of consistent profitability. This is well demonstrated
by the wide holding of SEAS' shares and its market standing. An analysis of
QEAS' past performance is presented in the context of its limited autonomy. The
actions and measures proposed to address the issues of pricing and water
management, dividend policy and financing plan, as well as proposal for
monitoring VEAS' financial performance are discussed in this chapter. Further,
aspects related to the possible transfer of TEK's distribution operations in the
region to QEAS and proposal to address possible implications of the
implementation of the proposed Project are also discussed.
4.02        VEAS has received five loans/credits from the Bank Group since 1963.
The last loan (Ln.2750-TU) was made in 1985 for the recently completed Sir
Hydropower Project. Because of the restrictions placed on VEAS' investments, due
in part to the creation of TEK in 1970, there was no new lending to CEAS from
1972 to 1985. Among other things, VEAS agreed under the Sir Hydropower Project
to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5. QEAS has complied with
all the covenants under the loan and its performance has been satisfactory.
B. Past Performance and Present Condition
4.03          Detailed historical financial statements are presented in Annex
4.1 and a summary of its operational and financial performance for the period
1986-91 is provided in Table 4.1.  The financial data and the analyses are
presented in current US Dollar equivalent in order to remove the effects of high
inflation in Turkey, which averaged 56X per year during the 1986-91 period based
on the wholesale price index. Further, the income from financial investments is
excluded from the analysis in order to assess the profitability of the utility
operations of the company.
4.04        The installed generation capacity of QEAS remained at 298 MW through
1990 when it almost doubled to 581 MW in 1991 on account of the completion of the
Sir dam and power plants. The generation from QEAS owned power plants increased
up to 1988, but decreased sharply over the 1989-91 period due to the poor
hydrological condition during the latter period as well as the shut-down of three
units of the old thermal plant at Mersin. Further, the additional capacity from
the Sir plants has not been entirely available to QEAS in 1991 because of the
progressive commissioning of the three units (3 x 100 NW).   The demand for
electricity in the region was met from energy purchased from TEK, which increased
from 2148 GWh in 1986 to 3179 GWh in 1991 and is estimated to be 2740 GWh for
1992. The generation from QEAS' hydro plants is expected to improve further in
the current year.

which is the single largest operating cost for the utility. Although the power
purchase cost is a pass-through (para 4.14), the linkage of such prices with
TEK's own tariffs which eroded substantially in real terms during the 1987-89
period has resulted in considerable variations in CEAS' earnings. The investment
incentives received on the Sir project for tax purposes and the tariff increases
- particularly the monthly adjustments since April 19908/ - helped CEAS maintain
the level of net income in Dollar terms.

in 1989. The production from  Figure 4.2
the Sir power plants, which
reached 503 GWh compared to
392 GWh expected in 1991, contributed to reversing the adverse trend in
generation costs and would help reduce the generation costs beginning 1992. Its
predominantly hydro capacity has thus contributed to significant variations in
CEAS' cash flows and profitability. As regards power purchase cost, the stable
margins providod incentive to QEAS to reduce transmission losses and reduce
costs.
4.07          Recognizing its limited role in controlling profitability through
tariffs and power purchases, VEAS has managed efficiently all areas of operations
that are under its control. QEAS completed the construction of the Sir dam and
power plants on originally planned schedule in spite of delays of about a year
in the initial phase of the project due to changes in the final design warranted
by safety aspects related to spill ways. This provided VEAS the needed self-
generation capacity without delay. Further, QEAS adopted good operations and
maintenance practices (para 2.15) ensuring plant availability and reasonable
transmission losses, thereby keeping its costs of operation competitive.
4.08        QEAS managed its surplus cash prudently by investing in marketable
securities, including Government securities, and realized attractive returns,
more than compensating for the high inflation. The substantial cash and cash
based assets helped finance a part of the peaking investments of the Sir project
8 Monthly adjustment of electricity tariffs was instituted for the first
time in Turkey in April 1990 to prevent further erosion of electricity tariffs
in real terms in the context of the financial restructuring of TEK as well as
of the launching of reforms for the subsector. The monthly adjustment of
electricity tariffs has since remained in effect.

and the requirements in 1990-91 of the initial expenditures in local currency for
the proposed Project. The current ratio, therefore, fell from 3.0 in 1989 to a
still very satisfactory 1.9 in 1990 and slightly improved to 2.0 in 1991.
4.09        QEAS has exercised cautious cash management practices and ensured
timely collections from customers. gEAS has no major customers in arrears. The
overall accounts receivable is less than seven weeks of sales and receivables
over three months old amount to less than 2X of total sales in 1990. This has
been facilitated by the fact that QEAS sells energy in bulk to its customers in
the region and that its payments to TEK for energy purchases are offset against
receipts from it for energy sold to TEK's DEs, the largest customer.
4.10        As regards financing of its power infrastructure, VEAS has been able
to obtain equity capital from the market and long-term loans in foreign currency
from the Bank Group (para 4.02). gEAS is conservatively capitalized and its debt
to equity ratio at end 1990 was 49/51 on unrevalued assets and 42/58 when equity
is restated to reflect asset revaluatioi. (para 2.27). The issuing of new equity
of TL 150 billion (US$36 million equivalent) in 1991 has helped gEAS meet
investment requirements and maintain a balanced capital structure.  The debt
service cover has been more than adequate given that QEAS did not contract any
new debt in the late 1970s and early 1980s and that all of its long-term debt
outstanding since 1985 are the Bank loans.
4.11        With the regional demand for electricity projected to grow at an
annual rate of 6.9% during the decade, the Sir project has provided SEAS the
scope to increase its own generation and correspondingly reduce its dependence
on TEK. The Sir project (about US$240 million equivalent) also increased its
debt outstanding five times over the 1986-90 period and necessitated new equity
issues to finance the Project. The proposed Project (which is estimated to cost
about US$667 million including financing costs), while increasing SEAS' self
generation pool by adding another 510 MW, would also increase its indebtedness
to about US$377 million equivalent by January 1997, the year of its expected
commissioning. It would also necessitate new equity issues during project
construction. The utility is well placed to undertake the Project and in order
to ensure the predictability of QEAS' earnings and its financial viability,
satisfactory agreements have been obtained from GOT regarding tariff policy
applicable to gEAS (para 4.15).
C. Tariff Agreements
4.12        The GOT and TEK agreed with the Bank in 1991 under the TEK
Restructuring Project (Ln. 3345-TU) to implement, beginning January 1, 1993, a
revised Tariff Policy acceptable to the Bank along with other reforms aimed
towards financial restructuring of TEK. The principles of the new tariff policy
are to increase and sustain the self-financing capability of TEK in accordance
with certain financial performance criteria and to establish a tariff structure
dictated by the economic costs of electricity supply.   Specifically,  the
agreements reached are that the new tariffs would:
(a)   reflect the power system's long run marginal costs of supply,9/
which would in turn be based on the agreed least-cost investment
9 The system's LRMC, based on the mission's estimates using the agreed
least-cost investment program, is US.; 5.75/kWh in 1989 prices which is
equivalent to US.0 6.40/kWh for 1992 in current prices.



- 41 -
program for expansion of the power subsector; and
(b)   enable TEK (i) to achieve a minimum debt-service cover of 1.5 from
1993 onwards ; and (ii) to generate from its operations, funds
equivalent to not less than 25X of its investments10/ in 1993, 30Z
in 1994 and 35X each year thereafter.
Until the implementation of the revised tariff policy, the agreed interim
arrangement for tariffs is for TEK to adjust electricity tariffs monthly or
quarterly so as to maintain the average revenue for TEK at no less than US.0
6/kWh, measured on an annual average basis. This agreement with the Bank is now
in effect and TEK's tariffs are being adjusted monthly since April 1990. TEK's
average revenue for 1991, the first year of the agreement, reached TL 251/kWh
(US.¢ 6.02/kWh at TL 4166/US$ average for 1991).   TEK's average revenue is
expected to reach TL 449/kWh in 1992, which is equivalent to US.0 6.33/kWh based
on projected average exchange rate of TL 7C90/US$.
D. Proposed Tariff Policy and Implications for CEAS
Energy Exchange Price with TEK
4.13        TEK and QEAS exchange (sell and buy) energy in bulk at the 380, 154
and 33 kV levels depending on the system iznterconnection. QEAS buys from TEK at
its interconnection with TEK at substations Erzin (380 kV) and Toroslar (154 kV).
Due to system considerations, VEAS sells energy to TEK in small amounts at these
substations. For supply to the DEs, QEAS sells to TEK at the 33 kV substations.
The price at which TEK buys from QEAS at the 33 kV level for supply to its DEs
is set at 80X of applicable tariffs to industrial and other bulk customers at
that voltage level whereas the price at which TEK sells to or buys from VEAS at
the 380/154 kV level ("Exchange Price") 11/ is set according to the established
base-level of TL 32.35/kWh (February 1987 base) as per the Power Exchange
Agreement (para 2.19). Rate increases to electricity tariffs since the date of
the Power Exchange Agreement have been applied to the respective bases.
4.14        The effective tariffs for January 1992 are TL 276/kWh for TEK's sales
to QEAS and TL 318/kWh for QEAS' sales to TEK's DEs, which are equivalent to
US.0 5.11/kWh and 5.88/kWh respectively (current prices). Based on the monthly
increases planned by TEK to reach the target level of TL 449/kWh for 1992
(para 4.11), these tariffs are expected to reach TL 336.75/kWh and TL 381.65/kWh
on annualized average basis, which are equivalent respectively to US.r 4.75/kWh
and 5.39/kWh1Z/ for 1992 using forecast average exchange rates for the year.
Thus, although the prices provide a reasonable margin to QEAS, and are expected
to reach near parity with the system's LRMC, they are not set on any rational
basis. The exchange price should: (i) be based on the economic costs of supply
10 The investments refer to the average of three-year investments,
namely, the actual for the previous year, the budgeted for the current and the
planned for the next year in order co smoothen the typically large variations
in year to year investments of power subsector.
11 The "Exchange Price", on average, represents about 751 of TEK's
average revenue.
12 These levels would represent about 931 and 951 respectively of the
system's LRMC in current terms, based on the mission's estimates using the
agreed least-cost investment program.



- 42 -
at the relevant voltage levels; (ii) be in line with the overall structure of
tariffs; and (iii) allow both TEK and QEAS to achieve appropriate performance
criteria. The new tariff policy would be based on such principles.
Implications for CEAS
4.15         The new tariff policy to be implemented from January 1, 1993, setting
tariffs on the basis of the LRMC of suppl.y at the relevant voltage levels would:
(i) remove any arbitrariness in pricing; and (ii) enable the determination of the
efficiency and/or inefficiency of the DEs.   Since QEAS' generation pool is
predominantly hydrobased (83%, para 2.06) while TEK's is only 43% hydrobased its
operating costs are lower than TEK's; therefore the revised tariff levels set to
allow TEK to achieve the agreed financial performance criteria would allow QEAS
to exceed similar performance criteria. Financial projections for SEAS, based
on the agreed minimum of US. C. 6.0/kWh for TEK's average revenue (nominal terms),
indicates that VEAS would be financially viable and able to generate sufficient
funds from its operations for the project (paras 4.24-4.26). Further, before
implementation, the new tariff policy would have to be reviewed and agreed by the
Bank under the TEK Restructuring Project. However, pending the implementation
of a new tariff policy satisfactory to the Bank, in order to provide the needed
comfort to private cofinanciers (para 4.18), GOT agreed to: (a) maintain the
prevailing tariff setting system and continue to establish electricity prices as
agreed under the TEK Restructuring Loan; and (b) ensure that electricity prices
including the exchange prices between TEK and VEAS under the new tariff policy
would not adversely affect the financial condition of QEAS.
E. Investments and Financing

4.17         The total requirements of VEAS amount to about TL 9.9 trillion
(US$639 million equivalent) over the 1992-96 period including interest during



- 43 -
construction, about 80X of which (US$508 million) would be for the hardware
covering the Berke Dam and power house, transmission lines and substations.
Foreign exchange requirements amount to US$370 million equivalent representing
58X of total costs, which would be met from the proposed Bank loan and
cofinancing from other sources (para 4.18). As regards financing of local costs,
CEAS proposes to apply 70X of the net cash generation (about US$238 million
eqitivalent representing 38X of total investments) towards the Project and meet
the balance requirements from customer deposits, new equity and borrowing. CEAS'
approach to apply only a part of the internally generated funds is intended to
provide for contingencies and is Justified because: (i) the generation from its
predominantly hydro-based capacity is subject to hydrological conditions; and
(ii) it has no control over electricity tariffs. Further, CEAS experienced a
shortfall of about US$12 million (about 9X of foreign iosts) in the Bank loan
(Ln.2750-TU) for the Sir Hydropower Project due to appreciation of the contract
currencies vis-a-vis the US Dollar.   New equity is proposed to be raised from
stock issues for an amount of US$84 million equivalent.
Cofinancing
4.18        The project would be cofinanced with loans from other sources.  For
a hydropower project of its size, the proposed Project requires long-term
financing.   Based on the terms CEAS has received from private sources, the
projectinns (para 4.25) show that the financing plan would require a substantial
amount a. .onger terms, such as those of the Bank's, to preserve the financial
viability of CEAS. The IFC has proposed to lend US$50 million with a maturity
of about 15 years including 4.5 years grace, as well as US$50 million in
syndicated loans from commercial sources with a maturity of 8 years including 4
years grace. The IFC has completed its appraisal and has confirmed that the
proposed commercial loans are syndicatable. However, before finalizing the deal
with IFC, QEAS intends to evaluate several offers of financing arrangements which
it has received from manufacturers/suppliers of turbines, generators, electrical
and electro-mechanical equipments as well as hydromechanical equipments for
financing procurement of these equipments. The combined foreign cost of these
equipment packages is about US$80 million equivalent including contingencies.
With the Bank's participation through the proposed loan (para 4.19), CEAS expects
to be able to negotiate better terms with suppliers. QEAS is inclined to accept
the IFC's proposal since, inter alia, it would permit procurement under
competitive bidding rather than tied-p;ocurement under other offers. Based on
the fact that VEAS has received financial offers, including from the IFC, and
that the procurement and financing arrangements for the electrical, electro-
mechanical and hydromechanical equipments can be finalized as late as a year
after those for the civil works according to the implementation schedule, VEAS'
proposal is acceptable.   In order to ensure availability of funds, gEAS has
agreed to finalize the agreements with cofinanciers before June 30, 1993.
Proposed Bank Loan
4.19        The proposed Bank loan of US$270 million would complete the financing
plan. Considering that the proposed Project would more than double the asset
base of the utility (from US$297 million in 1991 to US$759 by end 1996) and
necessitate commitment of all available cash flows to the Project, the interest
during construction on the Bank loan would also be financed.
Dividend Policy_and Eauitv Einancing
4.20        gEAS'  dividend policy is to declare such dividends as deemed
necessary to maintain its market standing. Further, SPK's regulatLon requires



- 44 -
that dividends shall not be less than 50X of C istributable income or 20X of paid-
in capital, whichever is larger, not exceeding 75X of distributable income13/.
Based on such stipulation, the dividends to be distributed during the
construction of the proposed Project would amount to TL 2,454 billion (US$154
million equivalent). QEAS proposes to reinvest its profits by recovering most
of the distributed dividends through issue of new equity, thus ensuring stability
in dividend payout from market perspective and compliance with statutory
requirements. During 1988-91, QEAS issued new equity on a stock-rights basis up
to US$95 million equivalent to reinvest from the distributed profits of US$121
million equivalent during that period when Sir Hydropower Project (Ln. 2750-TU)
was under construction.
4.21         QEAS must obtain clearance from the SPK for issuing new securities
to the public. For any new issues of shares up to the authorized level, the
application is accompanied by a three-year financial forecast which will allow
SPK to determine whether VEAS will be in a strong enough financial position to
ensure adequate returns to investors.   An increase in the authorized share
capital requires a meeting of the shareholders representing at least 75X of
existing capital, obtaining a two-thirds vote in favor of such an increase and
applying to SPK for such authorization.   VEAS' authorized share capital has
increased every year, from TL 15 billion in 1987 to TL 150 billion in 1990. The
recent increase of up to TL 300 billion in 1991 has been fully paid in. The
total amount of equity proposed to be issued during 1992-96 amounts to about TL
1,200 billion (US$84 million equivalent) during the implementation of the
proposed Project. VEAS has obtained SPK's approval for increasing its-authorized
capital up to TL 1,500 billion. It is expected that new equity issues would be
on stock rights basis and is intended to recover the dividends declared during
the period (para 4.20). Based on the fact that VEAS has had no difficulty in
obtaining clearance from the SPK or in selling new shares due to its good market
standing, QEAS' proposal is satisfactory.
F.  Financial Forecasts
4.22        The financial forecasts of QEAS were prepared under various scenarios
to take into account its limited control on financial performance due to
naturally constrained hydrological conditions and its inability to set
electricity tariffs (paras 2.06, 4.05 & 4.06). Accordingly, reduction in hydro
generation due to adverse hydrological conditions and/or more than estimated
water diversion upstream of Sir dam, and reduction in tariff levels were
considered for such scenario analyses.   The Bass Case assumes yearly hydro
generation based on typical cycles in hydrological conditions and the prevailing
level of US. 0 6/kWh for TEK's average revenue to be maintained using the Bank's
forecast of inflation and exchange rates.   Alternative scenarios test the
sensitiveness of VEAS' cash flows and financial performance to a decrease in
hydro generation (Scenario A) and a decrease in tariff levels (Scenario B).
4.23        In order to estimate the reduction in hydro generation, the state of
poor hydrological conditions (dry year conditions) was imposed on all hydro
plants of VEAS.  Based on statistical analysis using recorded data on river
stream flows spanning 44 years (1944-88), the probability of a dry year was
estimated to be about 151 (i.e. 15 years in a span of 100 years of water flow)
which corresponds to three dry years during the 1992-2010 period. The generation

- 45 -
of the hydro plants was estimated using the computer model (VALORAGUA) which
simulates mixed thermal-hydropower system and optimizes the generation of hydro
plants taking into account the irrigation and other requirements for use of water
as constraints. Accordingly, accelerated development upstream of Sir dam was
assumed to account for more than currently estimated off-take of water for
irrigation and drinking water projects. In addition, six dry years were imposed
during the period 1991 - 2000 (expected number of dry year is two) to simulate
VEAS' finances under worst-case hydro scenarios. The dry years imposed are for
1993, 1994 and 1996-98, corresponding to peaking investments for 1994 and peaking
debt-service in 1997-99. Details are provided in Annex 4.4. As regards tariffs,
US. C 5.50 for TEK's average revenue was used for Scenario B.
Financial Results
4.24            Forecast financial statements for QEAS for the period 1992-2000 under
the  base  case  scenario  is  provided  in Annex  4.1.    QEAS'  key  operational  and
financial performance indicators for the period 1992-2000, as well as project
financing  plan  under  the  three  scenarios  are  provided  in  Annex  4.5.    The

4.25        The forecasts show that QEAS' performance under all three scenarios
are satisfactory, although the year-to-year variations are as significant as was
observed in its past performance (paras 4.05 & 4.06).   While the trend in
financing surplus and debt-service-cover-ratio (DSCR) is similar under all three
scenarios, all other things being same, CEAS' financial performan'ce is more
sensitive to reduction in hydro generation than in tariffs as shown by the
financing surplus and DSCR under scenarios A and B. Specifically, the financing
surplus shows a negative US$ll million in 1994 (Scenario A), the year of peak
investments, implying a drawdown of cash resources in that year. However, the
net cash generation would be positive under all scenarios, due in part to QEAS'
proposal to build-up contingency reserves from internally generated funds
(para 4.17).   The hydrological cycle assumed implies hydro generation being
substantially lower than in the base-case in all the years during 1993-98,
resulting in lower DSCR in the 1996-99 period when debt-service would be
highestl4/. Such hydrological cycle assumed for Scenario A is highly unlikely,
but nevertheless shows the sustainability of QEAS' cash flows under extreme
conditions. The proposed actions regarding water management aspects (para 3.32)
would ensure increased coordination among CEAS, DSI and TEK thereby minimizing
the hydro risk. As regards tariffs, the prevailing agreement with the Bank
(para 4.12) as well as the proposed agreement on exchange prices affecting QEAS
(para 4.15) would ensure revenue mobilization for QEAS.  Furthermore, the US
Cents 6/kWh average level assumed for TEK is conservative and higher tariffs
would be required for TEK's own cash flow needs and compliance with the agreed
financial performance criteria (para 4.12).  CEAS' performance shows improvement
beginning 1999 and could be expected to improve further as the commercial loans
would have been fully repaid by 2000.
CEAS' Creditworthiness
4.26        QEAS has maintained its creditworthiness satisfactorily in the 1980s
as indicated by debt-service-cover - the ratio of cash operating income to debt-
service - well above the agreed 1.5 (para 4.02), and intends to maintain it
satisfactorily in the future. However, the statutory stipulation for QEAS to
distribute at least 50X of its distributable income (para 4.20) would place
dividends above debt-service payments. Furthermore, since QEAS is not allowed
to revalue assets (para 2.27), the depreciation provisions are less than
desirable, thereby increasing the distributable income and statutory dividends.
Despite the financial projections showing a debt-service cover of 1.5 and higher,
the stipulation on dividend distribution would likely reduce QEAS access to
borrowings from private lenders.   In order to ensure the needed comfort to
lenders and enhance scope for mobilizing funds from private sources, the standing
debt-service-cover agreement with the Bank must be modified to account for
dividend payments. The financial projections under the extreme case (Scenario
A) show this ratio after dividends to be in the range of 1.3-4.2 during
1992-2000, with the lowest of 1.3 in 1998. However, considering that substantial
part of CEAS' own generation is subject to hydrological conditions and that the
tariff agreements would ensure CEAS' financial viability (paras 4.12 and 4.15),
the minimum DSCR (after dividends) to be set should ensure balance between
providing comfort to lenders and guaranteeing shareholders' returns.
Accordingly, a debt-service-cover-ratio of a minimum of 1.2:1 on an after
dividends basis would be adequate. QEAS has agreed to maintain, beginning with
1993, a minimum debt-service-cover ratio of 1.2 net of dividends paid.
14 The financial projections assume eight-year maturity including four-
year grace for syndicated commercial loans based on IFC's proposed terms.

G.  Prospegtive Take-Over of Distribution Operations
4.27        CEAS has been negotiating with TEK and MENR,  since 1989,  the
prospects and terms of transfer of operating rights of TEX-operated power
facilities in the Cukurova region.  CEAS' concessionary agreement, revised in
1988 under Law 3096 (para 2.01), accords it a regional atility status.  The
concession, in addition to providing rights for new investments in generation,
transmission and distribution infrastructure, provides for the transfer to VEAS
of the operating rights of the existing infrastructure in the region, under
mutual agreement between QEAS and the current operators.
4.28        DSI owns the Aslantas hydropower plant (138 MW), which is located
down stream of Sir and the proposed Berke dam, and is operated by TEK. TEK owns
and operates the 380 L-V transmission lines and associated substations, as well
as the three DEs in the provinces of Adana, Icel and Hatay. Based on the long-
term objective of converting TEK into a national transmission company for HV grid
operations and the legal complexities affecting the TEK-operated and DSI-built
hydroplants, the 380 kV transmission lines and the Aslantas HPP have been removed
from  the  purview  of  QEAS'  concessionary  agreement  through  a  decree.
Accordingly, only the three DEs are under consideration.
4.29        CEAS has not found any of TEK's various proposals attractive enough.
The latest proposal (August 1991) involved CEAS taking over from TEK the complete
operations of the three DEs and hence their profits/losses. Because of the time
needed to gradually address the problem of over-staffing and high distribution
losses in the DEs, TEK proposed to sell energy at prices that would provide
incentive to QEAS to realize a profit. The governing contract for the operation
of the DEs would reward/penalize performance. The proposed performance based
contract is expected to reduce overall financial losses to TEK from these DEs and
improve the efficiency of the DEs. However, the privatization of TEK and/or its
operations is under review by the new Government and no time table has been set
by GOT for this purpose.   CEAS is well placed to ensure that its financial
viability is not adversely affected by any arrangement for transfer of DEs to its
scope of operations. However, in order to ensure that a change of such scale in
its scope of operations does not affect the implementation of the proposed
project, VEAS has agreed to periodically exchange views with the Bank on the
progress of distribution takeover and review the details of such takeover,
including the implications thereof, before finalizing the arrangements.
V. ECONOMIC JU-STIFICATION
5.01        The Berke hydroelectric project is part of the least-cost generation
expansion program for Turkey (1991-2010). Its size and timing are economically
justified. The expansion of the transmission network included in the scope of the
project is also justified on the basis of the economic benefits associated with
the incremental electricity which would be transmitted through the expanded grid
starting in 1995. The revenue from average tariffs used in the analysis is based
on the LRMC of supply calculated by the mission, which is US.0 4.9/kWh at
generation level and US.0 5.4/kWh after transmission level (154 kV) and US.0
6/kWh at distribution level. In addition, the economic analysis was undertaken
reflecting other benefits to the economy encompassed in the consumers' surplvz.
All costs are expressed in 1991 constant economic prices, tet of taxes nd
subsidies - local costs are expressed in equivalent border prices.
5.02        The project's marginal benefits vls-a-vis the possible generation
alternatives have been analyzed using a systems approach. Further, an estimate
of the internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the Berke Project and for the



- 48 -
investment in transmission lines, substations and load dispatch center necessary
to connect the hydropower station to the 154 kV grid is provided. In addition,
a separate economic analysis is provided for the investments in expansion and
rehabilitation of the transmission network, including an estimate of the IERR for
this component.
The Proiect as a Least-Cost Generation Alternative
5.03        The candidacy of the proposed Project as part of the least-cost
generation expansion plan has been tested under a broad range of adverse
assumptions: on increase in the discount rate used in the WASP optimization model
from ten percent to fifteen percent, twenty percent increase in the project cost,
and load growth reduced from nine percent to seven percent a year. A base-case
sequence is presented in Annex 1.5 and discussed in Chapter 1.  In order to
highlight and analyze the project's comparative advantages in terms of cost
savings an alternative least-cost expansion sequence was optimized without Berke.
The characteristics of the alternative sequence are described in Annex 5.1 and
compared with the configuration of the least-cost plan. The alternative sequence
presents an overall lower installed capacity (164 MW lower than in the least-cost
solution), and a different system configuration resulting in 190 MW additional
thermal installed capacity and 354 MW less hydro-capacity installed than the
least-cost plan.
5.04        Arnnex 5.1 describes the economic costs corresponding to both the
optimal generation expansion sequence (where Berke is singled out as a separate
project)  and the alternative expansion plan.   The system costs  include:
(i) investment cost, including investments to reduce environmental impact;
(ii) operational costs, consisting of O&M and fuel costs; and (iii) cost of
energy not served. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the cost savings associated
with the expansion plan including the Berke Project a-mounts to US$33.5 million.
The distribution and the NPV of the cost savings generated by the expansion plan
are summarized in Table 5.1, and presented in greater detail in Annex 5.2.

The difference in systems' configuration given by the larger thermal (less
capital intensive) component contained in the alternative sequence, entails lower
capital investments and higher operational costs for the sub-optimal plan. The
savings in avoided and deferred investment resulting from the least-cost
expansion are correspondingly negative and amount to a loss of US$17.57 million.
The unserved energy cost will also slightly increase (by US$5.66 million). The
savings brought about by the least-cost expansion plan consist in a US$56.71
million reduction in operational costs, of which US$40.31 million correspond to
fuel savings. This reduction in lignite-based generation capacity can also be
expected to have a positive environmental impact on the economy.
Benefits of the Berke Project
5.05        The IERR for the Berke Project and the transmission and distribution
investment components necessary to connect the power station to the grid is 15.21
(the benefit-cost analysis is described by Annex 5.3).   This estimate is
conservative since the net benefits do not capture the positive environmental
impact associated with the optimal configuration.  Table 5.2 illustrates the
results of a sensitivity analysis testing the economic feasibility of the project
against the following adverse assumptions: (a) investment cost increases by 101,
(b) project implementation delayed by one year, and (c) load growth reduced
substantially from 9.51 to 6.5X during the remainder of the decade. While these
hypotheses would not affect the feasibility of the project they would lower the
IERR to about 14X to 12%. The sensitivity analyses are described in Annex 5.3.

5.06        The economic analysis  for the regional  transmission expansion
component included in the project scope, though not part of the Berke hydropower
plant, is described in Annex 5.4. Investments are in constant 1991 economic
prices, while the benefits are captured by the revenue associated with the
incremental electricity transmitted through the grid in the Qukurova region as
a result of the investment. The energy to be transmitted via the grid more than
doubles after full commissioning of the Berke Project; in the absence of the
required transmission expansion foreseen in the project scope, the incremental
generation provided by the proposed Berke Project and further generation
expansion would face serious transmission constraints. The base-case benefit-
cost analysis corresponding to an incremental tariff equal to the LRMC of
electricity transmission (US.C 0.52/kWh) results in a IERR of 20X.   The
sensitivity analysis presented in Annex 5.5 tests the feasibility of the
investment against progressively lower values of the incremental tariff, showing
that the bench-mark incremental tariff for ele.-tricity transmission justifying
the investment corresponds to US.M 0.31/kWh.

ERKE HYDROPOWER PROJECT
Least-Cost Geneartlon Expansion Proram
1.          The long-term investment program is prepared by the planning
department of TEX in cooperation with MENR and DSI. MENR provides the
forecast for electrLclty demand and DSI formulates the ranklng for the hydro
generatLon capacity. The Lnvestment program li then submitted to 8P0 for
approval. The corresponding Lnvestment plan is however formulated only for a
flve-year perlod.
2.          Under the Core Investment Program (CIP) TEX Restructuring Project
(Ln. 3345-TU) agreement was reached on the power sector CIP for tho period
1990-1994. During the preparatlon of the Staff Appraisal Report for the
proposed Berke Hydropower Project, an lndependent least-cost analysis was also
carrled out. Further generatlon system optlons were examLned uslng hydro,
lignite, natural gas and lmported coal plants as acceptable candidates for
expanaLon. Special attentlon was paid to BOT projects. The analyaLs was
performed uslng the WASP III and VALORAGOVA system plannLng models which
determine the optlmal pattern of system expansLon necessary to mest the
electrLcLty requLrements of Turkey over a given perlod. The assumptlons and
constraints utllized for the study are detalled below.
3.          Demand Forecast: ElectrLcLty demand was forecasted by uslng two
dLfferent approacheos (a) econometrlc estimates, and (b) the MAED model. Both
approaches gave very sLmilar results, whlch were revlowed wlth INER, PO and
TEX. The long-term demand forecast on the basLi of which the requirements for
generatlon expanslon are established is shown in Table 1.1

currently flrmly committed and that could be added to the generation system before
the end of the planning horizon. The generation system expansion path is optimized

by selecting the least-cost solution obtained using the WASP model. The WASP model
Ls constrained to the level of demand provided by the MAED model. As candidate
units for the WASP, the following were considered: lignite fired steam turbine units
of 150 MW, 300 MW and 340 MW, 500 MW imported coal, 450 MW natural gas combined
cycle plant, and 1,000 MW nuclear unit. In addition, 75 hydro candidate have been
considered as candidates fr generation system expansion.  The sezluencing of
hydroplant has been initially determined by DSI. However, this ranking has been
later refined using the VALORAGUA computer program.
7.    Discount Rate.  The discount rate used for this analysis was 10%.  The use of
this assumption for the long-term planning purpose has been agreed with MENR and
SPO.
8.    Cost of Unerved Enerov.  The expected unserved energy is the
probabilistically determined amount of yearly electricity demand that in not
supplied because of generating deficiencies and/or shortages in basic energy
suppliers. The cost of unserved energy is included Ln the WASP objective function
as a way to consider explicitly cost/reliability trade-offs. Thus, if the unit cost
of unserved energy is assumed to be zero, the least-cost expansion plan will follow
the minimum allowable reserve margin. Conversely, if the cost per unit of unserved
energy is assumed to be very high, the least-cost expansion plan tends to have
relatively high reserve margins. In this study, the basic cost per unit of unserved
energy is assumed to be represented as a function of the unserved energy. The
reserve margin and reliability of the power system were not set in advance, but they
were obtained as a result of the optimization anticipating the unserved energy cost
given as c - 0.1 + 2.* (E,/Et)2, where Et is total generated energy, and E, is
unserved energy. The coefficients were determined so as to represent the cost of
energy generated by a diesel generator (US$0.1/kWh) and loss of the GDP due to
unserved electrical energy (US$2.0/kWh).

are very often given as constraints of
the system optimization.   In our
approach the price of unserved energy
were given at the outset so that system
reserve margin was obtained as a result                I a4
of the optimization and is consistent                l
with economically optimal levels of the
reserve margin.  A weak point of this
approach is that the price of the                      H4
unserved energy cannot be precisely
determined.   In order to provide a                        ¶      a  43 .      , a  a   l
better approximation, an additional                        AATIO OF UNSERVE ENE   Y PR CIE TO LRMC
analysis has been done so as to obtain    Figure 1.1
functional relations between long run
marginal cost, unserved energy price and
system reliability (reserve margin).  The system was optimized with unserved energy
price equal to N*LRMC, N - 1, ..., 10, so as to obtain the system reliability level.
The results are presented in Figure 1.1.  High price of unserved energy will request
very high additional investment and would have little incremental contribution to
reliability of the system. The economically optimal system reliability as shown by
the result presented on Fig. 1.1, is at around LOLP value of 3%. Corresponding
unserved energy price of 3*LRMC is consistent with the value used in the system
optimization.

For an annual C(DP growth of 2%, peak demand for the vear 2010 would
reach 22.8 GW (15.956/load factor 0.7), which compares to a maximum
capacity of 22.3 (.W to be reached in 1996 through already committed
expansion projects. Any GDP growth above 2% would therefore require Pew
investment in power generation during 1991-2010. Furthermore, even for a
very unlikely (DP growth rate of 2X, there would be a need to install an
additional capacity of 6 to 8  V.T before 2010, in order to achieve an
acceptable reserve margin.

TURKEY
BERKS HYDROPOWER PROJECT
Technical Assessment of the Dam and the Powerhouse
General
1.            Origin of the Project Component:  Four major rivers are located
within the 9EAS service area: the Goksu and Tarsus rivers in Icel Province, and
the Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers in Adana Province. Of these, the Ceyhan River the
largest, in terms of both drainage area and discharge, and constitutes an
important regional source of irrigation water and hydroelectricity.
2.            A summary of existing and proposed hydroelectric projects on these
four rivers was provided in Attachment 1.  Of the 31 projects listed, the
proposed Berke project provides the highest installed capacity, and its 7.8 km2
reservoir is among the smallest. The project is located in a rocky, isolated
gorge, along stretch of the Ceyhan River: between the two existing dam/reservoir
systems: one located immediately upstream of the Berke reservoir at Sir, and the
other 2 km downstream of the Berke dam at Aslantas. This segment of the Ceyhan
River has a steep gradient (190 m of available head over a distance of 25 km) and
the Berke project was designed to make use of this hydraulic potential.
3.            A detailed water resources development master plan (IECO, 1966) was
prepared for the Ceyhan River Basin in 1966 which proposed a series of dams and
reservoirs along the length of the Ceyhan River for water supply, irrigation and
hydroelectricity.   Eight out of a total of twenty-seven projects have be3n
completed to date and the remainder are projected to be completed within the next
20 to 30 years.   The Berke hydroelectric project was one of the projects
identified in the rECO master plan.
4.            The Berke hydroelectric project has long been considered an
important potential source of electricity to the region and has been the subject
of series of feasibility studies (IECO, 1966; OTCA, 1969; Temelsu, 1978;
Energoproject, 1984; C&B/Aknil, 1990).
5.            Numerous alternatives to the proposed project were e aluated during
the planning process. Alternatives considered included variations in the plant
type, location, dam height and project layout.
6.            Project History:  The first Berke Feasibility Study, conducted for
DSI by IECO in 1966, envisaged two alternative layouts; either a high dam (207
m) situated at the Berke site with a power-house located immediately downstream,
or a run-of-river dam located further upstream with a 9340 m power tunnel which
would relay the water to a power plant located slightly upstream of the Berke
site. This second alternative was designed in the event of leakage problems
associated with the construction of a high dam in karstic limestone (IECO, 1966).
7.            In 1969, the Japanese Overseas Technical Corporation Agency (OCTA)
was commissioned to evaluate the projecc by DSI. Their --eport concluded that a
310 meter high dam could be constructed at the Berke site without inducing
leakage into adjacent valleys. No significant karstification was observed at the
dam site and u.he OCTA report indicated that any foreseeable problems could be
resolved by means of grout curtains (OCTA, 1969).

8.            The project was re-evaluated again in 1979, this time at the
request of the Electric Work Administration (CIE), by the firms Temeslu and
Energoproject, who designed a run-of-the river dam at Duzkesme, a 13.8 km power
tunnel and a power station at Berke (Temelsu, 1978; Energoproject, 1984).
Although the Duzkeeme-Berke scheme did not make full use of the available head
between Sir and Aslantas, this layout was proposed because of concerns about
leakage from a high dam located at the Berke mite.
9.            Based on the conclusions of the feasibility study, EIE completed
the final design documents and technical specification for the bidding documents
in the year 1983.  The final design divided the Ceyhan-Berke scheme in two
phasest
(a) Phase 1 - the Sir dam and the powerhouse; and
(b) Phase 2 - the Duzkesme dam and the powerhouse at Berke.
10.           The final design proposed thin arch concrete dams at Sir and
Duskesme (located about 7 km downstream of the Sir dam). The powerhouse for the
Sir dam was an outdoor type located near the toe of the dam, while that for the
Duzkesme dam was an underground type located at Berke and connected to the dam
with a seven-meter diameter tunnel about 11 km in length.   The installed
capacities proposed at Sir and Duzkesme (Berke) were 273 KW (3x91 NW) and 168 MW
(3x56 MW), respectively. The Bank's consultants of the preappraisal team of Sir
Project reviewed the final design prepared by EIE.   The Bank's consultants
commented that the second phase of the scheme (the Duzkesme dam and the Berke
powerhouse) needed further investigations -- especially the areas of the tunnel
and the powerhouse -- for proper estimation of its costs.
11.           As the project progressed, however, it became evident that there
were a number of problems associated with construction of the 13.8 km tunnel.
Unfavorable geologic conditions raised serious questions about the time arad cost
required for tunnel construction. Furthermore, the tunnel diameter was limited
by economic coneiderations, which in turn, limited the installed capacity of the
project. When further geological studies at the Berke site indicated that risks
of leakage were limited, the Duzkesme-Berke design was abandoned in favor of the
project described herein.
12.           The Redesian of the Project Component:  The firms of Coyne et
Bellier and Aknil were commissioned in December 1988 oy QEAS to draw up, under
a grant from the French government, the feasibility study of this project.
During the planning and design phase, a number of different alternatives were
evaluated, including the type of dam, height and design capacity, and the layout
of the hydraulic condults and power station.  These design alternatives are
discussed below.
13.           Two possible dam types were considereds a high rockfill dam with
a clay central core and a concrete arch dam. The concrete arch dam was selected
over the rockfill dam for the following reasons
- the deep, narrow gorge and competent limestone walls that
characterLze the Berke sLte are ldeal for the constructlon of
an arch dam;



79-                             Annex 3.1
Page 3 of 12
the narrowness of the gorge makes access difficult in the case
of a rockf ill dam, with respect to material haulage, placement
and compaction;
the presence of the Kemerkaya fault requires considerable
excavation and/or prevents the design of a steep slope on the
upstream face of the rockfill dam;
- no core material was available in the immediate vicinity of
the site (i.e. over 30 km away); and
- due to the above constraints, a high rockf ill dam was 27% more
expensive than the concrete arch alternative.
14.           An analysis of three alternative dam heights (176, 186 and 201 m)
was conducted to determine the most efficient project design. A 201 high dam
with a full supply level of El. 345 was determined to be the most economically
favorable for the project (see C&B/Aknil, 1990 for details). The reservoir area
does not change significantly with dam height, on account of the steepness of the
canyon walls.
15.           The design and location of the hydraulic conduits and power station
was determined by the geologkc conditions immediately downstream of the dam. The
Kemerkaya fault crosses the reservoir upstream of the dam and parallels the left
bank for a distance of approximately 800 m. Consequently, several areas of the
left bank are characterized by heavily fractured and tectonified rock, which is
not suitable for the excavation of large caverns or tunnels. In addition, both
banks of the river are susceptible to landslides over a distance of approximately
700 m downstream of the dam. In 1981, a landslide on the right bank caused the
river water level to rise by approximately two meters in this area.
16.           Three alternative conduit and power station configurations were
evaluated from the perspective of both physical and economic considerations. All
were located in the right bank to avoid problems associated with the Kemerkaya
fault zone.
-   Alternative 1 consisted of a 2057 m long headrace tunnel, a
power-house located in a rock spur across from the Ilica
thermal spring buildings and three 120 m long tailrace
tunnels.
-   Alternative 2 consisted of a power-house located immediately
downstream of the dam and a 1500 m long tailrace tunnel
discharging at Ilica.  Access to the power-house   q via a
1500 m long tunnel, running parallel to the tailraw tunnel.
-   Alternative 3 consisted of a power-house located immediately
downstream of the dam with a short tailrace tunnel and a long
access tunnel, as in Alternative 2 above.
17.           These alternative configurations were evaluated on the basis of
seven different rated discharges (159 to 415 m3/s) to determine the most
efficient design capacity of the system. It was found that the rates of return
were most favorable for Alternative 1, with the optimum obtained at a nominal
discharge of 300 m3/s (see Final Design Report, C&H/Aknil, 1991 for details).

This alternative is also the only one that avoids the right bank landslide area
mentioned before.
18.           RelationshiR with DSI Master Plan and Operational Alternatives:
The management and distribution of water resources in Turkey is administered by
the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) under the Ministry of
Energy and Natural Resources. Priorities for water use have been established,
in order of decreasing importance as follows: potable water supplies, irrigation,
flood control and hydropower. This ranking reflects the importance of irrigated
agriculture in Turkey's long-term development plans.
19.           A water resources development master plan was commissioned by DSI
for the Ceyhan, Seyhan, Berdan, Develi and Amik Basins and was completed ia 1966
(IECO, 1966).  This document proposed a series of irrigation and hydropower
projects in the Ceyhan River Basin, many of which have been completed or are in
the process of construction. Although the timing and some of the details of this
original master plan have changed over the years, the basic development plan has
been followed to a large degree. Attachment 2 depicts the location of existing
and proposed dams, reservoirs and irrigation projects in the Ceyhan River Basin,
compiled from maps provided oy DSI's Adana and Ankara offices in July 1991.
Further details on dams located upstream of Aslantas are provided in Attachment
4. A summary of existing and proposed irrigation works are listed in Table 3.2,
based on DSI correspondence to gEAS (Letter No.123.2004/5351, 17 October 1985).
According to this table, the volume of water diverted from the river for
agricultural purposes will increase by about three times by the year 2023, with
the largest volume diverted to the Amik Plains irrigation project. This project
involves the irrigation of 105434 ha and will require an annual water withdrawal
of 658 Mm3 from the Menzelet reservoir.
20.           Hydraulic  inflows  to the Berke  reservoir,  and  consequently
electricity production, will be largely controlled by the operating conditions
of the upstream diversion works. Between the 1996, when the Berke project is
scheduled for completion, and 2023, when the irrigation projects are scheduled
for completion annual river flows are projected to decrease by about 1100 Mm3
(24%), due to additional diversion from upstream structures for the increased
irrigation demand.
21.           To evaluate the effects of these diversions on the Berke project,
a reservoir operation simulation study was conducted using the SIM program. This
model simulates the monthly balance of water displacements in a system of
interconnected reservoirs, while taking into account the operational 'nd physical
constraints of the individual reservoirs, evaporation losses and the requirements
of irrigation projects. Hydraulic inflows to the Berke system were simulated for
four different years: 1996, 2001, 2010 and 2023.   The following operating
conditions were predicted using this model.
1966:    No shortages predicted for irrigation projects.
The minimum operating level for the Berke reservoir (289 m)
occurs during 2 months out of a total 528 months (0.4% of the
time).
2001:    Slight shortages are predicted for irrigation projects located
downstream of Kartalkaya dam.
The minimum operating level for the Berke reservoir occurs
during 24 months out of a total 528 months (4.5% of the time).

Page 5 of 12
2010:    Very slight shortages are predicted for Menzelet, in addition
to Kartalkaya.
2023:    Significant shortages are predicted for Menzelet (2 years out
of 44 years), in addition to Kartalkaya.
The minimum operating level for the Berke reservoir occurs
during 106 months out of a total 528 months (20% of the time).
22.      Currently (beginning of October 1991), a formal Protocol is being
negotiated between DSI and gEAS, whereby it will be guaranteed that 9EAS be
provided with the quantities of water promised (personal communication, CEAS).
The DSI letter confirming the upstream development has been already received by
gEAS. The Protocol, which is going to address other aspect of the Ceyhan river
water management is expected to be signed by about end of June 1992.
23.      Proiect Layout of Structures: The proposed project layout of structures
including the main arch dam, the downstream lower arch dam (for energy
dissipation), dams, headrace tunnel, surge tank, spillway tunnels, diversion
tunnel, penstocks, underground powerhouse, and tail race etc., appear to have
been carefully studied on the basis of: (i) geological conditions; (ii) rock
bedding planes; (iii) comparative advantage; and (iv) suitability and ease of
access and construction. Based on the relevant technical aspects, the POE and
Bank experts are in general agreement with proposed layout of structures, and in
particular:
(a)   all permanent structures (intake structures, headrace tunnel,
surge tank, spillway tunnels, penstocks, and underground power
house) being located on right abutment.
(b)   the powerhouse located downstream alongwith a long tunnel instead
of adjacent to dam, for increased generation and avoiding the
technical concerns of the possibility of left bank slides and
blockage of the tail race.
Geologv
24.      The Berke project site has been the subject of a series of geologic
investigations since the 1960s, when it was initially identified as a potential
dam site (Caglayik, 1970, 1971; Ayaclioglu, 1972; Aknil-Sial Group, 1988;
Demirtaeli, 1988; ozgul and Arpat, 1988, 1989; Knobel, 1989; Ozgul and Arpat,
19901 ChB/Aknil, 1990).
25.      Stratigraphic and structural interpretations of the regional geology
have evolved as the geologic data base has grown, and many of the details will
undoubtedly continue to evolve as more data becomes available In preparing the
feasibility report for the project, these previous investigations were reviewed
and large quantities of new data were collected and analysed, including 6395 m
of borehole data, 2203 m of adit data from exploratory galleries and a seismic
survey. The paragraphs below summarize the lithologic, structural and seismic
features of the region.
26.      LithQlo&X and Stratigraphv:  The lithology in the vicinity of the Berke
site consists largely of stratified limestone and dolomite deposits, in
association with a variety of other rock types, includiug schists, quartaites,
ophiolites and volcanic and marine deposits.



- 82 -                            Annex 3.1
Page 6 of 12
27.      These various rock types are organized into two fundamental units: an
older, 'autochthonous' unit (deposited in situ), and a younger, 'allochtonous'
unit (originating elsewhere) which was emplaced as an overthrust nappe
(C&B/Aknil, 1990).
28       The autochthonous unit consists of a series of Paleozoic schists,
dolomites, limestones and quartzites which are overlain by Mesozoic-aged
carbonates. The relatively impervious rocks of the Paleozoic series outcrop to
the east of the project site.  The carbonate deposits of the Mesozoic series
outcrop at the project site and consist of five separate units: the Akcinar,
Sulucadere, Colak, Berke and Ilica Formations.  Two of these formations, the
Sulucadere and Colak, contain impervious layers which play an important role in
the watertightness of the reservoir (Ozgul and Arpat, 1988, 1989, 1990). These
two formations are described in further detail below.
29.      The Sulucadere Formation underlizs the reservoir itself, and consists
of a lower dolomitic section, a middle section of alternating dolomites and
limestones, and an upper limestone section. Two impervious clay layers have been
identified in the upper part of the dolomitic section which play a fundamental
role in the watertightness of the reservoir. These clay layers, identified as
TRskl and TRsk2, are 50 m and 120 m thick, respectively (Demirtasli, 1988; Ozgul
and Arpat, 1988, 1989, 1990).
30.      The Colak Formation consists of a thin layer of cherty limestone
overlain by impervious bed of volcanic ash deposits (tuffites) approximately 60
to 100 m thick. These tuffites are overlain by the calcareous Berke Formation,
which is capped in turn by the Ilica Formation (Ozgul and Arpat, 1989; C&B/Aknil,
1990).
31.      The rocks of the allochtonous unit outcrop to the west of the project
site and consist of a combination of ophiolites, volcanics and deep marine
deposits (Ozgul and Arpat, 1988). This relatively impermeable unit also plays
an important role in the watertightness of the proposed reservoir.
32.      The limestones and dolomites in the vicinity of the Berke dam site do
not show widespread karstification, with the exception of an area located on the
left bank, near the Xemerkaya fault (Ozgul and Arpat, 1988). Karstification is
the process by which solution channels form in carbonate rocks. These channels
may range in size from less than a centimeter to tens of meters in diameter and
frequently form above impervious layers or along fractures or faults.  Where
present, karstic strata may constitute a severe source of leakage.
33.      The lack of karstification at the Berke site may be attributed in part
to the widespread occurrence of dolomite, which is theoretically less soluble
than limestone, and to the recent regional uplift of the region which was
accompanied by rapid lowering of the hydrographic system (C&B/Aknil, 1990). The
Xemerkaya karst is located at an elevation well above the future water level of
the reservoir, and appears to be a fossil karat system which formed when the
river flowed at a higher elevation (C&8/Aknil, 1990).
34.      Structure:  The stratigraphic sequence described above has been subject
to multiple periods of folding,  faulting, uplift and erosion.   Structural
interpretations are complicated by difficulties of access and by the abundance
of rcck slides and talus.  A gross simplification of the structural 1Matory of
the region is provided in feasibility study. As indicated in this study, the

autochthonous unit was subject to extensive folding, prior to the emplacement of
the allochtonous nappe from the west. The entire lithologic sequence was then
fractured by a series of NE/SW-trending thrust faults (N300E to N40°E), which dip
to the west at angles of 55-80°.
35.      The most important fault in the vicinity of the Berke dam site is the
Kemerkaya fault. This fault crosses the Ceyhan River just upstream of the dam
and runs northeast, paralleling the riverbed. This fault has displaced the upper
units of the Sulucadere Formation over the clay layer TRsk. Immediately upstream
of the dam axis, the fault splits into two major branches which bound a shear
zone composed entirely of intensively folded and faulted TRsk (C&8, 1990). None
of the faults present morphological evidence of recent seismic activity (C&B,
1990).
36.      Watertightness:  The initial feasibility studies for the Berke dam site
were discontinued because of concerns about the watertightness of the reservoir
and dam abutments. A high rate of leakage could have serious consequences, both
with respect to the viability of the hydroelectric project itself, and in terms
of the regional hydrology.   Therefore,  subsequent studies focused on the
identification and tracing of potential sources of leaks (e.g. karstic limestone
and faults), as well as the identification of impervious layers in the region.
37.      A review of topographic maps for the region indicates that only three
areas in the project vicinity have surface elevations of less than 350 m and
could thus potentially be affected by leakage from the reservoir. These are the
Andirin Valley to the northeast, the Sabun Suyu Valley to the south and the
downstream portion of the Ceyhan River valley.
38.      The risk of subsurface leakage to the Andirin valley is considered
unlikely, as the limestone strata which underlie this valley are separated from
those underlying the Berke reservoir by the impervious ophiolitic deposits of the
allochtonous series (Eroskay et al, 1978; Aknil-Sial, 1988; Ozgul and Arpat,
1988).   Similarly,  it appears that the Sabun Suyu area is protected from
subsurface leakage by the presence of a hydrologic barrier between the reservoir
and valley (C&B/Aknil, 1990). Therefore, the Ceyhan River valley has been the
primary focus of studies on the watertightness of the dam.
39.      Two impervious stcata have been identified in the vicinity of the
project site: the volcanic tuffites o' the Colak Formation and the clay layers
of the Sulucadare Formation. These layers are of critical importance in ensuring
the watertightness of the dam and reservoir, and thus considerable energy has
been expended in tracing these strata both horizontally and vertically (Ozgul and
Arpat, 1988, 1989, 1990).
40.      The tuffites of the Colak Formation outcrop along the right bank of the
Ceyhan River at an elevation of 170 m and roughly parallel the reservoir to a
point approximately two kilometers upstream of the 'am site. At this point, the
tuffite bed descends to the level of the river, and thus no longer serves as an
effective barrier to potential seepage to the limestones of the Berke Formation
which lie to the west (C&B/Aknil, 1990). The maximum seepage gradient from this
area (5°/.-) would result in negligible water losses, unless continuous open
karstic solution channels were present. No surficial karstic features have been
observed in this area at an elevation of less than 350 m. However, in the event
that subsurface leakage paths do exist, the proposed grouting layout will ensure
that these can be detected and remedied (C&B/Aknil, 1990).

41.      On the left bank, the clay-bearing strata TRsk2 of the Sulucadere
Formation acts a an impervious layer which generally parallels the Kemerkaya
fault. The impervious nature of TRsk2, as well as the fact that the ground water
drainage basin is closed toward the south, is confirmed by observations of
groundwater levels in drill holes. This data indicates that the groundwater
table rises to the east and south and that the direction of groundwater flow will
always be towards the reservoir in this area (Coyne et Bellier, 1990).
42.      The proposed grouting scheme consists of a grout curtain constructed
&sear the right shore of the reservoir which extends upstream from the dam for a
distance of 800 m.  From this point, the curtain turns to the northwest and
continues for an additional 800 meters, passing through the tuff beds and up to
the Berke formation. The number of galleries and intensity of grouting will vary
from place to place, as required by site specific hydrogeologic conditions
(C&B/Aknil, 1990).
43.      The Berke project has many similarities to a recently completed (1983)
dam and hydroelectric project at the Oymapinar site, on the Manavgat River in
southern Turkey. This project was design by Coyne et Bellier and consists of a
185 m arch dam and a 540 MW underground powerhouse situated in an area of karstic
limestones. A grout curtain of similar designed to that proposed at Berke was
constructed and has been successful in preventing leakage from the reservoir and
dam abutments (ozis and Yanar, 1984).
44.      Seismicitv: The tectonic setting of western Turkey is controlled by the
interactions between the African, Arabian and Anatolian continental plates. The
seismic activity and crustal deformation observed in this area is the result of
the convergence of the African and Arabian plates with the Anatolian plate.
These plates and their component blocks are separated by major fault zones
tncluding the Dead Sea Fault, North Anatolian Fault and East Anatolian Fault.
45.      The closest of these, with respect to the Berke site, is the East
Anatolian Fault (EAF). This fault has been active since the Pliocene and has a
total observed displacement of 22-27 km, implying an average slip rate of
5 mm/year (Arpat and Seroglu, 1972, 1975; Yalcin, 1978). The EAP consists of
14 separate fault segments (Barka and Kadinsky-Cade, 1988), which can be grouped
into 5 segments which are capable of inducing strong earthquakes. Of these, the
110 km-long Tetirlik-Turkoglu segment lies closest to the study area, 25 to 40 km
away.
46.      According to historic records, the EAF has been the site of several
earthquakes greater than magnitude 8.0 on the Richter scale.  Most of these
occurred before 1000 A.D., the most destructive occurring in 995 A.D. (Ambraseys,
1970). The Tetirlik-Tr-koglu fault segment has not experienced a major shock
since the 12th century. During this century, several earthquakes of moderate
magnitude, but greater than 6.5 on 4- e Richter scale, have been recurded along
the EAF, including the earthquakes of 1905, 1908 and 1971.
47.      Recorded seismic data for the project area was obtained from the USGS
Olobal Hypocenters Database (1939-1988) and from other sources. Seismic activity
in the region is characterized by shallow earthquakes (less than 5C km in depth)
of moderate to low magnitude. According to this figure, the strongest recorded
earthquakes in the vicinity of the Berke site (1945, 1951) measured 6.0 on the
Richter Scale and occurred at a point approximately 75 km to the west. Smaller
shocks (less than 6.0, Richter Scale) have occurred within 10 to 40 km of the

Page 9 of 12
site (Coyne et Bellier, 1991). No surface breaks have been associated with any
of these earthquakes.
48.      Seismic Risk: Two alternative methodologies were used: a probabilistic
approach, which assumes an equal probability that an earthquake will occur at any
point in the area, and a deterministic approach which takes the regional tectonic
setting into account.
49.      The probabilistic analysis (Cornell-McGuire method) developed for the
Feasibility Report was based on the methodology and assumptions used for the Sir
Dam site, situated 20 kilometers to the north (Energoproject, 1982). Using this
methodology, a peak soil acceleration of 190 cm/s2 was adopted for the Maximum
Probable Earthquake (1000 year return period) (Coyne et Bellier, 1990).
50.      The deterministic approach was conducted in accordance with the latest
recommendations of the International Commiraion on Large Dams (ICOLD, 1989) and
requires the analysis of critical seismogenic sources and the assignment of
maximum earthquake magnitudes. Design criteria are then obtained by considering
the most severe combination of the maximum magnitude and minimum distance,
independent of the return period. Two design criteria are determined using this
approach: the Maximum Design Earthquake (MDE) and the Operating Basis Earthquake
(ODE). The MDE will produce the maximum level of gr..und motion for which the dam
should be designed. When subjected to this seismic load, the impounding capacity
of the dam must be malntained. The ODE is the level of ground motion at which
only minor damage is acceptable. Following an earthquake of this magnitude, the
dam, appurtenant structures and equipment should remain operational and damages
should be easily repairable.
51.      For the Berke dam analysis, Tetirlik-Turkoglu segment of the  WA,
located 25 to 40 km from the dam site was assumed to be the critical aeismogenic
source.   Five alternative methods were used to determine the MDE based on
documented relationships between earthquake magnitudes and fault parameters such
as rupture length, rupture area, slip rat.e, total displacement and seismic moment
(Slemmons, 1982t Wyss, 1979; Woodward-Clyde, 1979; Hanks and Kanamori, 1979).
These methods yielded fairly consistent results, ranging from 7.3 to 8.1.
Therefore, a magnitude of 7.5 to 8.0 was recommended for the MDE. Peak soil
acceleration values derived from an earthquake of this magnitude ranged from 0.14
to 0.3 g (Coyne et Bellier, 1991). An OBE of 6.0 t'. 6.5 was selected based on
a review of the regional seismic data, which corresponds to Peak soil
acceleration values ranging from 0.04 to 0.14 (Coyne et Bellier, 1991).
52.      The results of the two seismic risk studies are ln close agreement.
Therefore, the design parameters proposed for the Berke dam project seem both
appropriate and well documented.
53.      Motion accelerographs shall be installed in the dam and its foundation
and will monitor any seismiclty.
54.      Reservoir Induced Seismicity: The question of the potential of induced
seismity for Berke dam and the impacts of the project on geologic structures,
particularly wlth respect to the Kemerkaya fault was studied in detail. A fiold
survey of this fault revealed no morphological evidence of recent seismic
activity (C&B/Aknil, 1,90). The following discussion analyses the unlikely or
very limited extent of the reservoir induced seLimicity.



- 86 -                           Annex 3.1
Page 10 of 12
55.      There have been several documented cases of seismic evants induced by
the filling of large reservoirs (e.g. Xoyna, Krematoa, Kariba), with maximum
recorded magnitudes of 6 to 6.5. The impoundment appears to act as a modifying
or triggering phenomenon, whereby elastic strain release is accelerated or
advanced.   It le now accepted by the ucientific community that reservoir
impoundment could produce reservoir-induced seismicity only in those systems
already near failure; i.e. the naturally accumulated elastic straln release is
triggered by the impoundment of the reservoir.   According to Vladut (1988),
induced seismicity is of greater concern in areas with low levels of natural
seismicity. In areas with high levels of seismic activity, it may increase the
frequency of seismic events, but is unlikely to increase the magnitude.
56.      The physical mechanism responsible for induced seismicity is not fully
understood, but appears to be related to higher fluid pressures resulting from
increased head. Stress changes resulting from surface loading may increase the
likelihood of crustal failure in areas of normal and transcurrent faulting, but
may inhibit failure in areas of thrust faulting.   Induced seismicity mainly
occurs in areas that combine steeply dipping faults, relatively high strain rates
and either extersional or horizontal shear strair..
57.      Tectonic forces in the Berke project area are primarily compressive, as
indicated by regional thrusting and folding. The reservoir area appears to be
seismically much less active than along the East Anatolian Fault zone and no
active faults have been identified close to the reservoir. This suggests that
accumulated elastic strain related to the convergence of the African, Arabian and
Anatolian plates is mainly released along the East Anatolian Fault zone. For
these reasons, it is unlikely that strong earthquakes will be triggered by the
impoundment of the Berke reservoir.
58.      The proposed Berke reservoir lies over two crustal blocks separated by
the Kemerkaya fault. With this geometry, stress changes resulting from surfare
loading will be roughly equivalent for each block and will not be a determinant
for crustal failure. Given the dimensions of the faults identified in vicinity
of the reservoir (Hanks and Kanamori, 1979; Kanamori, 1977)), if an induced
earthquake occurs, its magnitude should not exceed 4.0. Under the worst case
scenario (earthquake of magnitude 4.0, located in close proximity to the dam),
horizontal peak accelerations will be less than those taken in account in dam
design.
59.      The  reservoirs  associated  with  the  Sir  and  Aslantas  dams  are
considerably larger than the Berke dam reservoir and are located in tectonically
similar setting. No seismic events were recorded during the filling of these
reservolre (source: personal commurnications, 9EAS and DSI). In any case, the
Berke dam has been designed to withstand earthquakes of up to a magnitude of 8.0
on the Rlchter Scale, which is well above the world strongest recorded reservoir
induced seismicity event.
60.      The strong motion accelerogaphs installed in the Aam and its foundation
wlll monltor any induced seismicity.
61.      RLvyer  and watersheds:  The Ceyhan River originates in the high plateau
to the east of Mount Ercyias and flows southwest into the Gulf of Iskenderum,
crossing the Amanos Y,untain. It is 365 km in length, from source to mouth, and



- 87 -Annex 31

is the most important source of water in the region. Numerous tributaries join
the Ceyhan along its course. Within the future reservoir area, these include the
Cagirgan, Toprakhisar (which is the main one, and falls into the Ceyhan at Kerer
Banisi), Kayaduldul, and Suluca, in order from north to south. The Ceyhan River
is not navigable in its natural state, although small fishing boats may be able
to navigate on the various reservoirs constructed along the length of the river.
62.      At the Berke dam site, the Ceyhan River has a catchment area of
13,222 km2, 98% of which (12,950 W2) is located upstream of the Sir dam site.
Land uses within the catchment area are characterized by agriculture, forests,
villages and a few towns.
63.      Hater Availability and Flooding:  Thirty-five stream gauging stations
are maintained by DSI along the Ceyh3n River and its tributaries.  1935-1985
records from ten of these gauging stations and from the Kartalkaya reservoir was
used in estimating the surface water potential for the Berke reservoir
(C&B/Aknil, 1990). The average yearly run-off to the Ceyhan River was calculated
as 4817.75 x 106 m 3, equivalent to an average flow of 153 m3/s. Monthly average
flows range from 145 x 106 m3 in September to 894 x 106 m3in April.  Annual
flooding is caused by a combination of rainfall and snowmelt and occurs during
the period December through May. A flood frequency analysis was conducted and
flood hydrographs were developed  for various return periods.    (C&B/Aknil
Feasibility Report).
64.      The proposed reservoir has a surface area of 7.8 Wm2 at a maximum water
elevation of 345 m and contains a maximum storage volume of 427 x 106 m3.
Reservoir morphology is long and narrow, measuring approximately 25 km in length
and 300 meters in width. With the full supply level (345 m), the reservoir will
be quite deep, with an average depth of 55 m and a maximum depth of 186 m. An
evaporation rate of 1209 mm/year was calculated in the C&B/Aknil 1990 Report,
based on local climatic conditions at the site. The calculated retention time
(reser,oir volume divided by average discharge) is approximately 32 days.
65.      Impact of Dam Failure:   The impacts of the dam failure have been
evaluated on dwellings located downstream of the reservoir, the Katalepe Aslantas
National Park,  and the Aslantas dam.   The computations are based on the
assumption that there would be a total and instant failure of the dam. For the
region of the valley located immediately downstream of the dam, computations led
to a peak discharge of 600,000 m3/s. Taking into account the shape of the Berke
reservoir and the flow in the 2 km of valley preceding the Aelantas reservoir,
the peak discharge will be reduced to 230,000 m3/s at the entrance of the
Aslantas reservoir. The relatively favorable shape of the reservoir results in
general, in damping the transient effects. The study casts a light upon the
importance of two parameters:
*     the water level of the Aslantas reservoir at the time of failures
*     the speed at which the spillway gates of the Aslantas dam are
opened.
*        The main resulting conclusion is the necessity to monitor and analyse
on a regular basis the readings of the instrumentation (pendulum.,
extensometers, joint measurement devices, etc.) scheduled for
installation at Berke dam for dam safety monitoring.

Page 12 of 12
*        It appears necessary to severely apply the regulation whereby it is
forbidden to settle within the drawdown zone of the Aslantas reservoir.
This interdiction could be brought up to 160 m.a.s.l., unless in case
of an alert there is a stricter order to limit the water level of the
reservoir.
66.      Hydraulic Model Test:  93AS (under the contract with DSI) is carrying
out all the required hydraulic model tests.

Technical Assistance
I. Studies
1.          3EAS' load dispatch center is old and recent plants (Sir) were not
included in the system due to capacity reasons in the control room. There is
also no automatic coordination with TEK regarding optimization of generation
scheduling and the plant outages, but periodical plans are exchanged.  After
Berke hydropower plant is put into operation, it will be essential to estaalish
a proper interface with TEK's system, to ensure efficient load dispatch
operations. A modern load dispatch center with adequate capacity to meet gEAS'
needs through the decade would be constructed.   In order to determine the
optional location, size, characteristics, etc., a study would be undertaken.
2.    The proposed study (technical assistance) would consist of:
Phase-I:  -  A survey of the existing facilities.
- Identification of necessary interface equipment,.
- An evaluation of proposed schemes.
Phase-II: -  The engineering design and specifications.
- Preparation of bid documents.
- Assistance during bid evaluation.

RIS  HYDROPOWER PROJECT
CGMoarison of the Least-Co2t Exoansion Plans with Berke and
without B2rk Hydra Plant as a Candidate for Exoansion
1.          The least-cost expansion plan was described in Annex 1. 5.  In order
to evaluato the contribution of the Berke Hydropower Plant to the syxtem, an
alternative least-cout expansion plan has been formulated. In this alternative
sequence, all assumptions and constraints are the same, the same optimization
software was used, and all candidates for expansion but Berke are taken into
account as in the base case. The resulting least-cost expansion plan (without
Berke) is presented in Table 5.1. Table 5.2 allows for the differences between
the two solutions to be seen.
2.          The alternative sequence introduces in 1997 a 340 NW lignite-fired
plant in replacement of Berke. ThLi difference determines posterior, though
minor modLfications during 2002-2008.  The alternative sequence presents an
overall lower installed capacity (164 MW lower) and a different system
configuration resulting in 190 MW additional thermal capacity and 354 MW hydro-
capacity less than the least-cost plan.

TURKEY
BERKE HYDROPOWER PROJECT
Estimation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return
1.          All costs are expressed in 1991 constant economic values.   The
financial flows were converted to economic costs by: (a) netting out taxes and
other domestic transfer; (b) expressing the import component at CIF prices; and
(c) applying conversion factors to local costs in order to express them in
equivalent border prices.  The following conversion factors were used: local
materials at 0.8 of their domestic prices; skilled labor at 0.8 of the domestic
skilled labor wage rate; and unskilled labor at 0.6 of the domestic unskilled
labor wage rate.
2.          Benefits are measured as the consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for
the additional electricity supplied by Berke.   Consumers' WTP comprises the
revenue of additional sales and the consumers' surplus. The additional energy
was calculated based on the load demand projections constrained to Berke's water
availability. Sales revenues were estimated using as a proxy for average tariffs
the LRMC of supply at generation level. LRMCs estimated by the mission coincide
with current and agreed tariff levels; these are 4.9 c/kWh at generation level,
5.4 c/kWh after transmission and 6.0 c/kWh after distribution.
3.          The consumers' surplus is measured by the price above the tariff
level that consumers' are willing to pay. The valuation of this economic benefit
requires estimates of the price elasticities of demand. Consumers' surplus was
computed considering a weighted price elasticity of -0.42 obtained from an
econometric demand study for Turkey.   This value was adjusted in time as a
function of the consumers' income increase using an income elasticity of demand
equal to 2 obtained from the same source.
4.          The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the Berke Project and
associated transmissicn and distribution components is 15.2%.   Sensitivity
analyses, shown in the following tables, tested the economic viability of the
project to cost overruns, implementation delays and a lower demand growth. These
results are summarized as follows:
IERR
-     Base Case                                     15.2%
-     Cost overrun of 10%                           14.1%
-     one year implementation delay                 14.3%
-     Cost overrun (10%) plus delay (1 yr.)         13.3%
-     Lower demand growth (down by 3 points)        12.0%

S.          Additional sensitivity was undertaken to test the robustness of
results to economic assumptions related to the conversion factors, consumers'
surplus and sunk costs. Results of these tests are summarized below:
TERR
-     Higher conversion factors                     15.1%
(local materials: 0.8, skilled
labor: 0.9, unskilled labor: 0.75)
-     No conversion factors                         13.9%
(all factors equal to 1.0)
-     No consumers, surplus                         14.7%
(economic benefits - sales revenue)
-     No conversion factors nor consumers'
surplus                                      13.4%
-     Including sunk costs                          13.6%
(i.e. including investments of period
1989-91 in preparatory works)
