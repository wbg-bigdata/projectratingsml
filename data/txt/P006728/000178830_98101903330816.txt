APPRAISAL OF THE PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a water supply and sewerage
project for Palmira, Colombia, a city of 160,000 inhabitants, for which a
Bank loan of US$2.0 million equivalent is proposed. Palmira and other
major urban centers in Colombia have grown very rapidly , with their urban
services becoming more and more inadequate. Water supply and sewerage
especially have lagged, because they require large amounts of capital
which they have not been able to provide from internal funds since their
rates are traditionally low.
ii.       The project includes new water supply, treatment and distribution
works and some sewerage and drainage works. Palmira's population is grow-
ing at about 6% annually, and the project would eliminate the present
deficit in water supply and meet future demand for the next decade.
iii.      The project's financial requirements total US$4.2 million (US$3.8
million for the estimated project cost and US$o.4 million for the estimated
interest on the Bank and the local loan). Of the total amount, the Bank
loan of US$2.0 million would finance about 47%, covering the foreign exchange
cost of US$1.2 million (including US$0.2 million for interest on the Bank
loan) and local currency cost of US$0.8 million. A Colombian Government
loan would finance 28% of the total requirements and the remaining 25%
would be financed from internally generated funds.
iv.       All project elements would be subject to international competi-
tive bidding.
V.        The Borrower would be Empresas Publicas Municipales de Palmira,
a municipal company set up to provide water supply, sewerage and the
telephone services, and operate the markets and slaughterhouses. The
Empresas would construct and operate the project, while consultants design
the project and supervise its construction. Although management is fairly
competent substantial administrative improvements are required.
vi.       The Borrower's financial position is weak.  In the past it has
been unable to meet debt payments for a telephone equipment supplier's
credit. The financial position wil improve with the higher tariffs for
water supply and sewerage and telephones recently introduced and the
future increases projected. Still, short-term borrowings will be neces-
sary to service the supplier's credit.



-ii -
vii.      Further increases in water supply and sewerage and telephone
tariffs are necessary. With the projected water supply tariffs, its
estimated earnings would awount to 4.7% on net revalued assets by 1973
and 9.1% by 1977. The projected telephone tariffs would enable this
service to meet its debt service and finance expanaion. The internal
financial rate of return on the project would be 20%.
viii.     With the agreements reached during negotiations noted in
Section VIII, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$2.0 million
equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a four-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF THE PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Colombia has applied for a Bank loan to help
finance a water supply and sewerage project for the City of Palmira (see
Map), to be undertaken by the municipal public utility company, the
Empresas Publicas Municipales.
1.02      The project includes water supply and treatment facilities,
tran;3mission mains, distribution lines, sewers, drainage canals, and
house conmections for water and sewage.
1.03      The cost of the works is estimated at Col$77.8 million (US$3.78
million equivalent), plus interest and commitment charges during construction
of Col$9.2 million (uS$o.45 million). The Bank loan would be US$2.0 million,
of which US$1.2 million would cover the estimated total foreign exchange
cost.
1.04      The project was initially appraised in July 1969, based on a
feasibility study by a consortium of two Colombian firms and a U.S. firm.
The initial project was reduced to keep it within the financial resources
of the Empresas by redesigning treatment plant expansion, staging water
distribution, and postponing some sewerage/drainage works.
1.05      During negotiations in April 1970 the Empresas' representatives
were not authorized to agree to water and sewage tariffs which would enable
the Empresas to be financially viable. It also developed that the Empresas
.as i*n default onr a supplier's loan for telephone equipment.  Therefore,
negotiations were suspended to enable a viable financing plan to be deve-
loped by the Empresas and a settlement made on the supplier's credit. This
report is based on the new tariff schedule presented by the Empresas, which
is slightly less than was proposed in the original appraisal report. A
settlement on the supplier's credit has also been reached. Meanwhile, new
engineering consultants, Indesco Ltda. of Bogota and Kennedy Engineers of
San Francisco, reviewed the original feasibility study and refined the
reduced project, and are currently preparing the detailed designs.

II. THE ECONOMI AND THE SECTOR
A. Basic Data
2.01      Colombia has a population of about 22 million.  The Gross Domestic
Product in 1968 was about Col$96 billion, equivalent to an average per capita
income of about US$300. The population is growing at a rate of approximately
3.3% per year, and emigration from rural to urban areas has resulted in urban
growth of 5% to 8% annually. The urban population represents about 57% of
the total, compared to less than 40% in 1950.
B. Urban Development
2.02      The Government's urban development policy is intended to preserve
some reasonable balance and proportion in the rates of growth of the various
cities. For this purpose, the cities have been divided into categories,
each of which is intended to have a specific role in balanced development.
The caterrories h-in -it.h +he nn4  1-1tr.'Pc2        D   4 _..  I   4, _- _  - 4+i
is to reduce demographic and social pressures. The remedy in the short term
is to promote growth in the next ranking cities, the "equilibrium metropo-
lises" of Medellin, Cali, and Barranquilla, so as to offer alternative
centers to attract economic activity and internal migration.
2.03      While these equilibrium metropolises provide the most immediate
alternative growth centers, the Government is taking a longer view to direct
future economic growth and migration towards the next tier, the intermediate
cities. These cities have populations of 30,000 to 200,000. The Govern-
ment's policy towards these intermediate cities, of which Palmira is one,
is to establish labor-intensive industry, integrate agriculture with industry,
provide the necessary public services, and prepare urban development plans
for the more important ones.
C.  Water Supply and Sewerage Sector
2.04      The rapid growth of the Colombian cities has resulted in inadequate
urban services of all kinds. The inadequacy has been especially marked in
the supply of potable water and the removal of liquid wastes, and is due to
the inability of the municipalities to provide the large capital requirements
for such services because of the traditionally low tariffs charged for them.
Often these services have not earned even their cash operating costs, much
less generated funds for the very large investmnents required. The Government
is now actively encouraging water supply systems to increase tariffs progres-
sively so as to earn a rate of return sufficient to meet their financial
requirements.
2.05      The country's urban water supply and sewierage sector can be divided
into three groupsy described below.
(a) Some 21 cities with populations above 20,000 have organized their
7wr. municipal empresas (companies) to provide such public services
as water supply, sewerage, garbage disposal, electric power dis-
trlbution, telecomnunications, marketplaces, and the like. These
cities have about 7 million of the total urban population of some
12 million. The empresas are generally well run.



-3-
(b)  There are about 750 water supply systems in the smaller cities,
which are under the control of the national water supply agency,
Instituto Wacional de Fomento Mumicipal (Insfopal), recently
transrerred to the Ministry of Health. These systemns are run
on a regional cooperative basis, with the cash profits of the
few profitable systems partially covering the cash deficits of
the ma-jority and Government grants making up the difference.
Their admqinistrative competence is usually poor.  The major
source of fundls for their :investments is Governrnnt grants.
(c)  The systems admianistered directly as municipal departments by
the synaller municipalities make up the third group). For the
most part these systems are poorly administered and their
services are grossly inadequate. Their number is unlmown but
may amount to a few hundred. The tendency is for them to
affiliate with Insfonal's system in order to get government funds.
2.06      The rural water systems, defined as those in towns of less than
2,5(o ponulation, are the responsibility of the Ministry of Public Health's
rural water supply -program, although some affiliated with Insfopal before
lhe rural program was fully established. The Ministry has started a com-
bination loan/grant program which includes technical assistance; the
TProqram1s success cannot be assessed as yet.
2.(7      The Colombian Government gives first priority to the municipal
empresas. Because of their size, managerial competence, and the concen-
tration of population, the empresas offer the best hope for achieving the
greatest benefits and institutional improvements relative to the other
categories of the sector. Also, this is the category where the major
nhstqcle to development of the sector -- low tariffs -- can be most easily
overcome.
2.03      The Bank made a loan of US$14 million to the Empresa de Acueducto
y Alcantarillado Bogota in June 1968 (536-co), and a second Bank loan for
expansion of the water supply service in Bogota is in preparation for fiscal
1971. A loan of US$18.5 million was made in 1970 to the Empresas Municipales
de Cali. The Inter-American Development Bank has made nine loans, totalling
US$43.2 million, to four empresas and to Insfopal.
2.09      The proposed loan for the Palmira project would be to one of
the empresas in the so-called medium cities. A group of these have
feasibility studies, financed in part by US-AID funds, ready for appraisal
and may be presented to the Board in fiscal 1972.  As the sector program
progresses, the Bank may be asked to consider financing projects in the
Insfopal system.

D. Palmira
2.10       Palmira is the twelfth city of Colombia and the second city in
the Cauca Valley. It represents the northern portion of the major urban
area developing around Cali-Yumbo.   With the new international airport
close to Palmira, future urban industrial development should tend to fill
in between Cali and Palmira. A national agricultural university and
research center have been established in Palmira, along with a number of
agricultural processing industries.
2.11       The proposed Borrower, the Empresas Publicas Municipales de
P'almira, is fairly well administered and has reached a level of profi-
ciency which will permit it to markedly improve its operations with the
financial and technical assistance proposed.



-5-
III. EXISTING WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
3.01      Palmira's present water supply is limited in quantity and is poor
in quality. Some industries have had to turn to the highly-mineralized
ground water because of insufficient public supply. Some unfiltered and
therefore unsafe water has been supplied to consumers because the capacity
of the treatment plant is insufficient. There are not enough sewers so
sewage and storm water cannot flow away. A number of inhabited areas have
open sewers, and some central areas of the city become flooded after heavy
rains with water heavily contaminated with sewage.
3.02      Palmira takes its water from the Nima River (see map).  The autho-
rity responsible for regional water resources, the Corporacion Autonoma
Regional del Cauca, has awarded the Empresas the right to abstract up to
1,000 1/sec provided the Empresas constructs a small holding dam when it
takes more than 600 1/sec (about 1974), at a cost of about Col$300,000.
3.03      The tail-race canal of a small hydro-electric plant on the Nima
River is used as the intake for Palmira's water supply. There is another
canal which also serves the intake if the power canal is not in use. Raw
water flows from the intake to a conventional treatment plant. The nominal
capacity of this plant is 290 1/sec, but the average rate of supply is over
400 1/sec. The treated water flows by gravity through two mains to the
city, 5 kms away. Annex 1 describes the system in more detail.
3.04      It is estimated that 87% of the city's population (that is about
139,000 people) is supplied with water. The house connections total 15,800,
of which 13,400 have meters although many of the meters do not work. There
are some hOG km of distribution piping, of which 85% is 10 cm in diameter
or sralle-r.  Piping 5 cm in uiameter or smaller (22.5%) is mostly of gal-
vanized steel, and should be replaced as it is too small and often
corroded.
3.05      The sewerage system is a combined one, that is it carries storm
water as well as sewage, and with its 100 Im of sewers serves about the
same area as that which is supplied with water. About 15,000 houses have
sewer connections. Untreated sewage and rain water drain into the Palmira
River, which flows through the city's center. The river frequently floods
adjacent low-lying areas, some of which are occupied by slum housing.
3.06      The Palmira River, which has a minimum flow of 600 l/sec at
Palmira, discharges into the Bolo River, which has an average flow of
10,000 1/sec, 11 kms below Palmira. These rivers drain agricultural
lands below Palmira and are not utilized for water supply or other pur-
poses. Sewage treatment will be needed at Palmira by about 1980 to pre-
vent deterioration of the River Bolo below a standard of quality Of at
least 3 mg/1 of dissolved oxygen.



-6-
3.07      The maintenance of both the water distribution and the sewerage
systems suffer from lack of personnel and attention from the management.
The Empresas is aware of this, and of the need for additional personnel
and some technical assistance. A meter maintenance program needs to be
instituted and meter repairing accelerated. Programw to correct these
deficiencies will be established by the Empresas with technical assist-
ance from the Pan-American Health Organization (see paragraph 6.08).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Description of the Project
4.01      The Project would consist of a new intake on the canal from the
River Nima. Should demand grow so as to require construction of a small
holding dam (see paragraph 3.02) duiring the construction years of 1971-73,
this would be built also. A new main would lead to a new water treatment
plant with a nominal capacity of 900 1/sec. This plant would be built in
parallel with the existing one, which would be renovated, mainly at a
later stage of the Project, to give a total nominal capacity of 1,500 I/sec
of adequate and reliable water treatment. Storage for treated water would
be provided, initially by a tank of 12,000 m3, and later by a second tank
of the same size. A new main with a diameter of 27 inches from the plant
to the city would be added to supplement the mains already in use, so
increasing the total capacity of those mains to 2,300 1/sec to meet peak
demands estimated at 1.8 times average demand.
h.02      At the city, extensive additions would be made to the network
of pipes, valves, etc. of the distribution system, including house con-
nections. Sewerage and drainage works would also be constructed. Con-
sulting services for engineering and management would form part of the
Project. Details of the various constructional works proposed are listed
in Annex 1.
4.03      Although a large number of sewers and drains are needed, only
the most urgent would be constructed. Additional works would be built
later as funds permitted.
h.ohv4    Palmira has plenty of ground water, and its utilization as an
alternative source was investigated in the feasibility study. The ground
water is high in iron and manganese and in hardness, and the cost of
treatment would make it more expensive than surface water from the Nima
River. The next expansion of water supply (about 1980) would be from the
Amaime River, 13 kms away.
B. Cost of the Project
4.05      Costs are summarized below.  The holding dam is not included.
Except for the price contingency, the prices are at 1970 values, with an
exchange rate of Col$19.00 to US$1.00. The annual investment program
is given in Annex 2.

are 10% of the construction sub-total. An annual local price contingency
of 8% and an annual foreign price contingency of 3% were added through the
construction period, reflecting price changes in recent years for these
types of works.
C. Loan Amount
4.07      A loan amount of US$2.0 million is proposed, representing about 47%
of the project's financial requirements totalling TJS$4.2 million, after
adding to the estimated cost of works (US$3.8 million), interest and other
financial charges (US$o.4 million) payable during construction on the pro-
posed Bank and Government loans.
4.08      The proposed loan amount would cover the following:
(a) US$0.92 million, the estimated foreign exchange cost of the
project, of which about 70% would be for the cost of direct
imports and the remainder for the foreign exchange
component of civil works;
(b) US$0.23 million for the interest and commitment charges on
the Bank loan during constructions; and
(c) us$o.85 million for local currency expenditures.



-9-
4.09     If the project cost is more than estimated, the Empresas would
be expected to meet the overrun and the Colombian Government has under-
taken to have promptly provided the necessary funds if the Empresas
could not do so. Should the project cost less than anticipated, the
Bank should consider financing 47% of the cost of additional sewerage
and drainage works.
D. Procurement
4.10     All contracts would be bid on an international competitive
basis. Since the construction works are small and routine they would
probably attract only Colombian bidders.
4.11     Foreign bidders are expected to supply treatment plant equipment,
major valves and accessories, and water meters. A 15% preference will
be allowed local manufacturers of equipment in the evaluation of bids.
This is not expected to change substantially the distribution of supply
contracts between local and foreign suppliers.
E. Disbursement
4.12     The Bank loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of all
direct imports and against a percentage (about 36%) of all local procurement
and civil works to reach 47% of the cost of the total works. A disbursement
schedule is attached as Annex 3.
F. Project Execution
4.13     The present consultants, Indesco, Ltda., of Bogota and Kennedy
Ingineers of San Francisco, are acceptable to the Bank and are employed
to design the project and would supervise project construction. Assurances
that satisfactory consultants would continue to be employed were obtained
during negotiations. The design work is being financed by a loan from
the Colombian Development Fund (Fonade), while the cost of construction
supervision would be covered by the Bank loan.
4.14     A three-year construction period, 1971 through 1973, is expected.
Project design would carry on into early 1971 and major construction
would take place in 1972 (see Annex 4).
G. Environmental Quality
4.15     The project would improve environmental quality by providing
ample supplies of safe water to the city. It would reduce environmental
pollution by removal of sewage and storm waters from the -urban area.
Pollution in the Palmira River would increase and sewage treatment would
be necessary by 1980 (see paragraph 3.06).



-10-
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The results of recent censuses in Palmira show a population growth
rate of about 6% per year (4nnex 5). This growth rate is expected to con-
tinue, which would bring the present population of L60,000 to 240,000 by
1978.  At present 87% of the population is supplied with water.  In 1978,
95% of the population expected at that time would be supplied, with water
of reliable quality and in adequate quantity, with the project in operation.
The project would be especially useful to industries now forced to use the
mineralized ground water. A substantial improvement to the sanitary
conditions would be started with the sewers and drains proposed in the
project.
5.02      The gross per capita daily consumption (including lost water and
commercial and industrial consumDtion) is Proiected to reach '00 liters.
Lost or unaccounted-for water should drop from the present estimated -,V
to 21% by 1978. These estimates are necessarily speculative, as is the
past and projected consumption shown in Annex 6, since the data on water
consumption in Palmira are poor. Consumption by type of customers and the
proportion of people served and the amount of water lost can only be
esti-4(ated within approximate but adequate limits.
5.03      The internal financial rate of return for the project, including
sewerage and drainage works, as measured by total water supply and sewerage
revenues is 20%. The calculation is shown in Annex 7. The benefits are
measured by the additional quantities of water provided, valued at the
proposed combined water supply and sewerage tariff after deducting incre-
mental operating costs due to the project. The costs are those of building
the project and the post-construction period investments necessary to
utilize it fully.
5.04      Not all of the benefits mentioned above are included in this type
of measurement, which relies on the willingness to pay as a measure of the
value of the benefits. Health benefits, both those directly accruing to
the consumers and indirectly accruing through a general improvement in the
health of the whole community, are examples of benefits which may be under-
stated or completely omitted by this analysis.
5.05      Projected earnings on water supply and sewerage services should
increase from a loss in 1970 to a small profit during project construction
(before interest) and reach a 9% return a few years thereafter. This
means that the Empresas could amortize the national and the Bank loan and
continue investments to catch up on the backlog of water distribution,
sewerage, and drainage needs.
K.06       4dditionally, although the Empresas of Palmira has a competent
C½,ineral Wvaiager, there are many operational deficiencies which can be
corrected with technical assistance. The institutional reforms which can
be a.hieved are a significant reason for proceeding with the proposed loan.

VI. THE BORROWER
A.. Empresas Publicas Municipales de Palmira
6.01      The proposed borrower, Empresas Publicas Municipales de Palmira,
is an autonomous entity which provides water supply and sewerage and local
telephone services and operates a slaughterhouse and two marketplaces in
Palmira.  (Power is distributed by the Corporacion Autonoma Regional del Cauca, a
regional authority.)  The Empresas was created in 1961 by municipal decree
and reorganized by subsequent decrees, the most recent being Decree 29 of
June 2, 1970. This Decree was a major reform of the statutes to make the
Empresas more autonomous and the Board a-political.
6.02       The Board of the Empresas is composed of six members.  Two are
appointed freely by the Mhnicipal Council, two are elected by the Municipal
Council from a list presented by the Chamber of Commerce, and two elected
from a list presented by the banking association of Palmira. The board
members are elected for a two-year period beginning from January 1, 1971.
6.03      The Board has extensive powers, including the power to fix tariffs
within the limitations approved by the National Tariff 3oard (and the Ministry
of Communications in respect of telephone service), approve contracts in
accordance with the Colombian laws and the statutes of the Empresas, and borrow
up to Col$150 million. The statutes provide that they can be modified only
by the Board and that the changes must be approved by the Municipal Council.
6.04      A general manager is nominated by the 3oard for a two-year term,
beginniag on January 1, 1971. The Board has traditionally delegated a
great portion of its authority to the general manager in the daily opera-
tions of the Empresas and this should continue. It is anticipated that
the present general manager, who has experience and is able, will continue.
B. Organization and Management
6.05      The Empresas is organized into four operating departments, an
administration department, and two staff units as shown in Annex 8. The
department of administration is a recent creation. The organization is
adequate to carry out the proposed project.
6.cj6     Water supply and sewerage is the most important department in
terms of revenues. In 1970 water supply and sewerage accounted for 40%
of total revenues, telephone services accounted for 31%, and slaughterhouse
and marketplaces for the remaining 29%.
6.07      The Empresas employs 2h6 persons, of whom 75 are in the Whter
3upply and Sewerage Department.  As recommended in the feasibility report,
the staff of this department should be increased by about 1%, principally
to improve the presently inadequate maintenance (see paragraph 3.07). There
has been some improvement recently of salaries of key staff personnel but
they are still below salary level in some of the other municipal empresas
in Colombia.



-12-
6.08      Accounting, billing, and financial planning, have been improved
progressively since the present manager took over in 1966. There are still
very many deficiencies, however, and assistance from management consultants
will be required. The Empresas has contracted with the Pan-American Health
Organization for management assistance. Assistance in maintenance opera-
tions (paragraph 3.07) has also been included. The cost of this assistance
is estimated at US$20,000 and will be funded out of the engineering cost
provision for the project.
6.09      The auditing of the Empresas' accounts are done by three different
auditors:
(a)  The commercial auditors, Touche Ross, Rodriguez and Vega, were
first hired to audit the statements of June 30, 1969. They
could not certify the January-June 1969 income statements and
certified only the July-December 1969 income statements. They
have since certified the 1970 accounts. The use of these, or
other acceptable auditors will be continued.
(b) The internal auditor is appointed by the Municipal Council and
is responsible for examining all the operations of the Empresasp
and reviewing effectively the Empresas' assets and financial
activities. These functions have not been properly performed.
(c)  The Contraloria de la Republica in Cali also reviews the Empresas'
operations in accordance with legal requirements for public
entities. Its comments are too late and too superficial to be
of value.



-13-
VII. FINANCE
A. Past Record and Present Position
7.01      The Empresas has a history of very low tariffs in both water
supply and sewerage, and telephone services. Water supply and sewerage
tariffs remained constant from 1962 to 1968. They were raised 2.9% in
1968, 43% on January 1, 1970 and 60% in October 1970 to the present level
of Col$0.80/m3 (US$0.22 per thousand gallons) (see Annex 9). Further
substantial increases will be necessary (see paragraph 7.12). Telephone
tariffs, unchanged since 1961, were doubled in September 1970. Further
small increases will be necessary.
7.02      Because of these low tariffs the Empresas was unable to finance
the needed expansion of the water supply and sewerage facilities. Instead,
all available funds from all services were used to amortize a supplier's
credit obtained for financing the telephone plant expansion begun in 1966.
7.03      Annex 10 shows 1970 audited Financial Statements.  The small net
profit recorded (Col$2.3 million) would have been wiped out if the Empresas
had charged a more realistic depreciation based on revalued assets. Current
assets of Col$3.6 million did not offset current liabilities of Col$9.4
million, and Col$5.9 million of these current liabilities were payments
due in 1971 on long-term loans for telephone equipment.
7.04      Internal resources proved inadequate in 1970, as the Empresas
was unable to meet debt payments to Siemens Colombiana, the supplier of
telephone equipment. By year-end 1970 the Empresas owed Siemens Col$1.7
million of 1970 maturities, even after borrowing Col$1.5 million short-
term to pay Siemens. A rescheduling of the overdue payments has been
agreed with Siemens in February 1971. Future payments of Siemens debt
are discussed further in paragraph 7.19.
B. Financing Plan
7.05      The financing plan for the project is based on the premise that
the Enpresas will not transfer funds generated by the water supply and
sewerage services for payment of the telephone debt or for any other
non-project use. Assurances have been obtained that transfer will not
take place during the construction period without the Bank's agreement.
7.06      The estimated cash-flow statements for the water supply and
sewerage services during 1971-73 are shown at Annex 12 and summarized
over-leaf.

7.07       As part of the Bank loan would finance local expenditures, the
exchange rate used in the financing plan to convert the proposed loan to Col$
was adjusted to reflect the following assumptions on price increases during
the construction period: 8% annually for local costs and 3% for foreign costs.
The rate of US$ 1.00 = Col$ 19.00 in December 1970 was thus increased by 5%
annually through 1973. Financial forecasts beyond 1973 (after completion of
construction) are shown at constant prices.
7.08       The funds required would be made available as follows:
(a) The Bank loan would be for US$2.0 million at an assumed
interest of 7-1/4% plus a commitment fee of 0.75% and
for 25 years, including four years of grace.



-15-
(b)  The Government loan would be Col$28 million at 10% for
18 years including 4 years of grace.
(c)  The Empresas' contribution would be the earnings of the
Water Supply and Sewerage Department and is expected to
meet 31% of total applications of funds during the
construction period.
7.09      The Col$13.3 million increase in working capital would include
Col$11.6 million cash at the end of 1973. Under the assumptions made,
this amount would become available mainly in the third year of construction
and would allow additional works to be built or, as the Bank would agree,
reduction in short-term borrowing.
C. Water Supply and Sewerage Financial Forecasts
7.10      The projected water supply and sewerage income statements are
shown in Annex 11 and summarized below (the financial assumptions are
set out in Annex 13):
U n i t s
1971     1973      1975
----Col$ millions-----
Total Revenues - including
non-operating income         10.1     17.6      23.3
Total Operating Expenses
including Depreciation        7.9     11.9      13.8
Income Before Interest          2.2       5.7      9.5
Rate of Return                  4.0%      4.7%     7.6%
7.11      The significant revenue increase of 75% between 1971 and 1973
is due to both the increase in volume of water sold and higher tariffs
(see paragraph 7.12). As a result of the project, the volume of water
sold would increase 19% in the period 1971-1973, reflecting a 10% increase
in production in 1972 and gradually diminishing losses.
7.12      The Empresas proposes to increase water supply and sewerage
tariffs 56% on July 1, 1971 to Col$1.25/m3 and on January 1, 1973 by 20%
to Col$1.50/m3. These increases are acceptable. The increase to
Col$1.25/m3 would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
7.13      To assure that earnings are sufficient, agreement was reached
during negotiations on a minimum rate of return as follows:
1971-1972-1973      4%
1974                 6%
1975                 7%
1976                 8.5%
Subsequent years    9%



-16-
7.14      The rate of return would be calculated by taking income before
interest as a percentage of revalued net fixed assets (excluding assets
financed by customers contributions). The net fixed assets would be the
average of the net fixed assets in use at the beginning and the end of
the year in which the rate of return calculation is made. Revaluation
and tariff review would be done twice a year in the first and second
semesters using the cost of living index for workers developed by Depar-
tamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) for the Cauca Valley
at the last month of the preceding semester. The base would be the
revalued fixed assets as of December 1970 presented in Annex 13 (Col$46.6
million).
7.15      As water supply and sewerage tariffs have to be authorized by
the National Tariff Board of the National Planning Department, the Govern-
ment has undertaken to take all steps on its part to enable the Empresas
to maintain tariffs as necessary.
D. Telephone Financial Forecasts
7.16      The projected telephone income statements are shown in Annex 14.
Total revenues are projected to increase 39% in the period 1971-1973,
reflecting a growth in telephone communications and annual increases in
tariffs of about 10%.
7.17      Assurances were obtained that the tariffs would be maintained to
provide the following minimum annual rates of return on the average net
current value of the telecommunications assets arbitrarily fixed as of
December 31, 1970 at Col$15.8 million:
1971-1972         10%
Subsequent years 12%
Full revaluation of the telephone assets would be completed within six months
of loan signing and the rate of returns would be adjusted between the Empresas
and the Bank to reflect the new asset base. The revaluation of assets and
the maintenance thereof would follow the same procedure as used for water
supply assets revaluation.
7.18      Telephone tariff increases have to be approved by the Ministry of
Communications.  Therefore, as for water supply tariff applications, the
Government has undertaken to take the necessary steps so the Empresas can
maintain the required tariff levels.
7.19      To meet debt service on the Siemens loans, the Empresas arranged
with Siemens in February 1971 the refinancing of the foreign exchange
component of the debt not repaid in 1970 and moreover may have to borrow
Col$5.5 million in 1971-1972-1973, as indicated by the telephone cash flow
projections in Annex 15. (The financial assumptions are found in Annex 16).
Borrowing is the only practical solution as meeting debt service through
earnings would require a tariff increase of about 150% in 1971, after a 100%
increase in 1970, which would leave the tariffs excessively high after 1972.
Col$2.5 million of financing has already been arranged at suitable terms.



-17-
E. Markets and Slaughterhouse Financial Forecasts
7.20      The projected income and cash flow statements for these services
are presented at Annex 17 and the financial assumptions in Annex 18. These
statements indicate that the services are always profitable and generate
cash. The cash is used by the telephone services (see Annex 15).
7.21      To insure that the tariffs of these services remain adequate, it
was agreed during negotiations that the tariffs would be maintained at a
level such that these services cover their costs and depreciations and
provide a modest profit, by the maintenance of an operating ratio before
depreciation of not more than 0.85.
F. Consolidated Financial Forecasts
7.22      Consolidated income, cash flow, and balance sheets statements
for the Empresas as a whole are presented in Annexes 19, 20, and 21. Total
income increases from a Col$1.1 million in 1970 to a Col$3.4 million in
1973. Total net cash surplus is Col$18.7 million by year-end 1973, which
is a comfortable margin.
7.23      The balance sheet current ratio will be 0.9 in 1971 and will
increase to around 2.3 in 1973 which will allow the Empresas to meet its
requirements for projected new investments. The revaluation of the Empresas'
assets is set out in Annex 22.
7.24      In view of the problem caused by the Siemens Loan, additional
debt would be limited during the construction period to:
(a)   Water supply and sewerage project purposes.
(b)   Not more than US$250,000 equivalent of short-term loans to be
applied to repayment of Siemens telephone supplier's credit.
7.25      After project construction, borrowing would be limited by the
general covenant that net revenues cover maximum future debt service at
least 1.5 times.



-18-
VIII.  RECOMNENDAOTINS
8.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points.
(a)  Water supply and sewerage tariffs would be maintained at levels
necessary to meet specified rates of return on revalued net
assets (paragraphs 7.12 to 7.15).
(b) The tariffs for telephone services and markets and slaughter-
houses would be kept at levels necessary to meet financial
requirements of these services (paragraphs 7.17 and 7.21).
(c) Consultants would continue to be employed to assist in project
execution and realization of operational improvementrs(para-
graphs 3.07, 4.13 and 6.08).
(d) Borrowing limits would be established for all three services
(paragraphs 7.24 and 7.25).
8.02      The Government agreed to provide Col$28 million as a 10% interest
bearing loan for an 18-year term.
8.03      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$2 million
for a term of 25 years, including a h-year grace period.

COLOMBIA
APPRAISAL OF THE PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE FACILITIES
A. Existing Treatment Plant
The principal intake is from the tail-race of a small hydro-
electric plant, as may be seen in Map 1. An alternative intake on the
Rio Nima is used when the canals supplying the two hydro plants are
closed for annual maintenance. The raw water flows 1,500 m to the treat-
ment plant via a 20 in. concrete pipe with a capacity of approximately
500 1/sec.
The raw water first passes through a pre-sedimentation tank 36 m
in diameter in which particles of sand and heavy silt settle out. This
preliminary settlement is reasonably effective, but when the water is very
turbid the quantities of solids are so large that they are difficult to
remove, and a flush of about 100 1/sec is necessary for this purpose. Dis-
charge of clean water over the circular weir of the tank is at a high rate
of 2.7 1/i/sec (140 gal/ft/min).
The water passes by a small and ineffectual grit chamber into a
chemical treatment house, where alum is added. The dosage equipment has
reached the end of its useful life. The flow is divided after the rapid
mixer (which sometimes works) into two flocculating chambers, serving each
of the plant's two sections (but neither horizontal flocculator works).
The first treatment section was constructed in 1938 and the
second in 1962. Each has a sedimentation basin and four rapid sand filters.
The older sedimentation basin has straight-through flow and its volume is
1,300 m.3 and its cross-section [0 m3.  The newer is an end-around unit
with a volume of 2,100 m3 and a cross-section of 40 m3. Even at 220 1/sec
each, detention periods of 1.6 and 2.7 hours and a velocity of 0.5 cm/sec
could give good results if the preparation of the water were adequate.
Floc is weak and some floc and appreciable turbidity get carried over into
the filters.
The four filters of each of the two sections of the plant have
a total area of about 100 m2 and 110 m2 respectively.  Assuming a design
rate of filtration of 2 gal/min/sq. ft. (80 )/min/m2 or 120 mJday), their
capacities are calculated to be 140 and 150 1/sec, respectively. With the
present flow of 440 1/sec, it may be presumed that the flow is proportion-
ately higher in both plants. The rate controllers have been removed and
the filters are loaded to their hydraulic limit.
Chlorine is added after the filters, and residuals are said to be
generally maintained in the distribution systems. There is no measuring
device in operation in the plant and the actual water production can only
be guesced at from the time when the venturi meters at the chlorination
house were working.



ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4 pages
The consultants studied modifications in the existing plant which
would permit it to treat 600 2/sec. These wor16 are included in the Project
and consist of:
(a)   An additional pipe from the pre-sedimentation basin to the canal
to avoid the flooding of the peripheral weir, now caused by
inadequate capacity of the existing effluent pipes, and an
automatic valve to periodically discharge sludge instead of the
continued flushing now used.
(b)   Raise the walls of the canal at certain critical points.
(c)   Install a Parshall flume to replace the present measuring weir
at the chemical mixing house.
(d)   Replace the existing alum and chlorine dosage equipment.
(e)   Install new rapid mixers for chemical treatment.
(f)   Change the motor and gearing of the flocculators and modify
these units to obtain different velocities in the four floc-
culation chambers.
(g)   Reconstruct the rapid sand filters, replacing the filter
bottoms, the filter media, and much of the piping and
installing new rate controllers and control equipment.
(h)   Eliminate a hydraulic restriction in the chlorination chamber.
(i)   Provide additional equipment for the laboratory.
Most of these works will be carried out in 1973, after the new
treatment plant has been completed, when the existing plant can be taken
out of service for renovation. In the meantime, as an immediate measure
to increase the capacity of the existing plant by some 50 1/sec, items (a),
(b) and (h) will be undertaken and the existing chlorinator temporarily
relocated.
B. New Treatment Plant
A new intake with a capacity of 1,500 1/sec will be constructed
and the existing intake abandoned. A 27 in. raw water main with a capacity
of 900 1/sec will be constructed in parallel with the existing one, from
the intake to the treatment plant. The existing pre-sedimentation tank will
be renovated to pass 1,000 1/sec as described above. A second tank will be
built in a subsequent stage.



ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4 pages
Rapid mixing, flocculation and sedimentation will be combined in
two units, each with a nominal capacity of 750 1/sec initially. Four
rapid sand filters will be constructed initially, each with a capacity of
225 1/sec. The nominal filtration rate will be 240 mJd (4 gal/ft2/min)
although the filters will be operated at reducing velocities beginning
with a maximum velocity of 360 m/d. The filter media will be sand and
anthracite. A 1,200 m3 filter-wash-water tank will be constructed,
although the alternative of pumping wash-water directly from the clear
water well is under study. Filter back washing will use surface wash.
Equipment for the addition of aluminum sulfate or lime, and for
pre-chlorination,will be provided at the entrance to the plant. Equipment
for post-chlorination and fluoridation will be provided after the filters.
A storage tank of 12,000 m3 capacity for treated water will be
constructed adjacent to existing storage at the plant. A second tank of
12,000 m3 will be constructed at a later date. A treated-water main of
27 in. diameter will be added beside the existing mains, for 5 km to the
city, where it will join the 36 in. main supplying the distribution
network.
C. New Distribution System

D. New Sewerage and Drainage
Although the present sewerage system is combined, future con-
struction will build separate severs for liquid waste and drains for storm
water. The sewerage and drainage works have been divided into three
packages listed below. Their designations refer to.sewer and drain lines
on feasibility study plans.

Package 1 is scheduled for construction in 1971 and is the most
urgent. Package 2 is the swing item in the project, that is, should con-
struction costs exceed the estimates (including contingencies), these
works will be postponed until funds are available. Alternatively, should
savings result, the works in Package 3 wili be advanced and built in the
project construction period.

PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Internal Financial Rate of Return
Assumptions
1.         Benefits are assumed to be measured by income before depreciation
(Annex 11). The year of maximum benefit without the project is 1970. There-
fore the 1970 income, before depreciation, is substracted from income of
subsequent years to get the incremental income, or supposed benefits, due
to the project.
2.         The costs are project works and new works less customers
contribution.
3.         All costs and benefits are adjusted to 1973 prices to put them
on a comparable price basis.
4.         Sales attributable to the project level out in 1978 and would
remain constant without further investment. Similarly, new works through
1978 are charged to this project as necessary investments to achieve the
benefits.
Calculation
5.         Adjustment of income before depreciation for 1970, 1971, 1972:
1970 Income before depreciation 1.1 x (1.08)3 - 1.4
1971 Income before depreciation 5.9 x (1.08)2 = 6.9
1972 Income before depreciation 9.1 x (1.08) = 9.8
6.         Adjustment of costs for 1971, 1972:
1971 Costs:  Works                    18.1
Customers Contribution  (1.4)
7-T x (1.08)2   19.5
1972 Costs:  Works                    50.4

The consolidated Balance Sheet for 1970 in Annex 21 differs
from the audited Balance Sheet presented herein due to:
1.  Revaluation assumptions of the appraisal report.
2. Adjustment to reflect negotiation of new debt rescheduling
with Siemens made in February 1971.
3.  Inclusion of Fonado II Loan, presumably signed by President
in April 1971.

Assumptions for Financial Projections
Income Statement
Revenue
1.        Water supply and sewerage tariffs have been increased to
Col$o.80/m3 in October 1970, 60% above the previous Col$0.50/m3 which
has been the average tariff since January 1, 1970.
2.        The tariffs are projected to increase to Col$1.25/m3 on July 1,
1971 and to Col$1.50/m3 on January 1, 1973.
Operating Expenses
3.        Chemicals and spare parts through billings are based on 1970
actuals, and increase with water produced, with an 8% annual price
inflation for the period 1970-1973.
4.        Administration - General is based on an allocation of 35% of
total administrative and general expenses in 1970. The allocated expenses
remain the same forthe period 1971-1972 and then increase 10% a year.
5.        Administrative contingency is 5% of all operating and
administrative expenses.
Non-Operating Income
6.        Based on 1970 non-operating income, increasing with ater sold
and including an 8% inflation each year in the period 1971-1973. It
includes fines for late payments, reconnection fees, and profit on new
connections and extensions of the distribution system.
Depreciation
7.        Annual depreciation is calculated at 3.5% of gross assets.
Gross assets include assets existing prior to the project and revalued
using the D.A.N.E. (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica)
Obrero Cost of Living index, which is also used to revalue works built
in the project. Existing assets are thus valued at Col$89 million on
January 1, 1971. New works are incorporated the year they are built.

NOTES ON REVALUATION
1.        The 1970 Revaluations are obtained an follows:
Water Supply and Sewerage Assets and Depreciation were revalued by
Management Consultants to the National Planning Office in 1969, using the
blue collar cost of living index for the Cauca Valley published by Depart-
mento Administrativo Nacional de Estatisticas (D.A.N.E.) for the assets
built after 1953. The assets built before 1953 were assumed built as of
1953, the index did not exist before 1953.
Telephone Asseta are arbitrarily revalued in 1970 so that the rate of
return on net telephone assets in 1971 is at least 7%. These assets are assumed 35%
deoreciated by 197n. A full revaluation will be conducted as a commitment
under the Loan Agreement.
Markets and Slaughterhouse assets are arbitrarily revalued 100%
in 1970 to Col$ 12 million and assumed depreciated 30%.
2.        All assets and depreciation are revalued 8% each year 1971 through
1973.
3.        Borrowings from the World Bank are assumed revalued by 5% in
each following year until 1973.
4.        Net results of the revaluations are tabulated below:
