PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(Loan 738-CO)
PREFACE
This is the Completion Report for the Water Supply and Sew-
erage Project for which Loan 738-CO was approved in May 1971 in the sum
of US$2.0 million. The Loan was closed in June 1980. There were no
cancellations.
The project completion report of April 27, 1981 was prepared
by the Latin American Caribbean Projects Department on the basis of the
findings of an October 1980 mission, documents contained in regional
files and information provided by various Bank staff members involved
with the project during its execution. Copies of the draft report were
sent to the borrower, the Empresas Publicas Municipales de Palmira (EPMP),
and to the Government.   While no comments were received from EPMP, the
opinion of EPMP, obtained during the October 1980 mission, is included
in Annex 10. The comments received from the Ministry of Finance, ex-
pressing concurrence with the findings of the Completion Report are
attached as Annex 11.
The project has not been subjected to an audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED).
The assistance provided by the staff of EPMP during the
October mission to gather information for the preparation of this
report is gratefully acknowledged.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA: PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(Loan 738-CO)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was the third Bank operation in the water sector in
Colombia.    Its princip:Le objective was to increase the capacity of the
water supply system for Palmira, Colombia's twelfth largest city, in order
to meet the projected 1978 water demand (para. 2.05). The project also in-
cluded sewage collection, drainage and technical assistance in management.
Project execution experienced considerable delays.      Work on the
various project elements began 12 to 48 months later than scheduled, and
final completion of the project was six years later than projected (para.
3.02).   Half this time resulted from Bank agreement to postpone the Loan
closing date to permit undisbursed Loan funds to be used for construction
of additional works. No one cause stands out as bearing major responsibil-
ity for the delays (para. 3.04). The conclusion is that the project sched-
ule was unrealistic. The impact of the delays on construction costs due to
inflation was substantial (para. 3.11).    As a result, the scope of some of
the project components had to be reduced.
Treatment capacity was sized to meet the 1978 demand.       However,
because of lower than projected population growth and lower than projected
consumption per connection, installed capacity will now be adequate until
1991 (para. 4.02).
The project was successful in meeting its objective of increasing
water supply capacity (para. 8.01).     In 1980, 98% of the population had a
piped water supply with continuous service.     However, tariffs remained low
and at the end of the project in 1980, and the borrower was in a difficult
financial position (para. 5.08 and 5.17). Low tariffs and a lower than an-
ticipated demand adversely affected the internal financial rate of return
(IFR). The actual IFR is 0.4% versus an appraisal value of 9.8% (recalcu-
lated) (para. 7.01).

PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I.   Introduction
Sector and Project Area
1.01      At the time of project appraisal in 1969 the Government of Colombia
had an urban development policy of preserving a reasonable balance and pro-
portion in the rate of growth of its various cities. To achieve this goal,
the cities were divided into categories, each of which was intended to have
a specific role in a balanced development. In order to reduce demographic
and social pressures in the capital city of Bogota, it was proposed to pro-
mote growth in the next ranking cities, i.e. Medellin, Cali and Barranquilla,
offering alternative centers to attract economic activity and internal migra-
tion. While these cities provided the most immediate alternative growth
centers, the Government had taken the longer-term view to direct future econo-
mic growth and migration toward the next level, the intermediate cities, with
populations of 30,000 to 200,000. This was to be achieved through the establish-
ment of labor-intensive industry, the integration of agriculture with industry,
the provision of necessary public services, and the preparation of urban
development plans. Palmira with a then estimated population of 160,000 in 1971
was one of these intermediate cities.
1.02      The rapid growth of Colombian cities had resulted in inadequate
urban services. This has been especially evident in the supply of potable
water and removal of liquid wastes, primarily due to the inability of the
municipalities to provide the capital required and of the traditionally low
tariffs charged for the services.
1.03      In 1969, Palmira was the twelfth largest city of Colombia and the
second largest city in the Cauca Valley after Cali. With an international
airport close to Palmira, urban industrial development was expected to grow
between Cali and Palmira. The result of censuses in Palmira (1970) showed
a population growth of about 6% p.a. during the prior decade. It was
expected that the growth rate would continue and bring the 1971 population
of 160,000 to a population of 241,000 by 1978. In 1971 the appraisal report
indicated that 87% of the city's population was served with water through
house connections.
Organization of the Borrower
1.04      Responsibility for the provision of water supply and sewerage
services in Palmira rests with the Empresas Publicas Municipales de Palmira
(EPMP). This organization is an autonomous municipal entity which not only
supplies water and sewerage services but also provides telephone services and
operates a slaughterhouse and two public markets in Palmira. EPMP was
created in 1961 by municipal decree. The Board of the EPMP is composed of 6
members all appointed by the Htunicipal Council for a two-year term. The
Board has the power to fix tariffs within the limitations approved by the
National Tariff Board, approve contracts in accordance with Colombian laws
and statutes of the EPMP, and borrow up to Col$150 million. A general
manager is nominated by the Board for a two-year term.



- 2 -
1.05      EPMP is organized into four operating departments, an    administra-
tion department and two staff units. The Water Supply and Sewerage Department
is the most important in terms of revenues. In 1970, water supply and sewerage
accounted for 40% of total revenues, telephone services for 31%, and the
slaughterhouse and public markets for 29%.
1.06      At the time of appraisal, EPMP had a history of very low tariffs in
both water supply and sewerage and telephone services. Water supply and
sewerage tariffs remained constant from 1962 to late 1968 at which time
they were increased from Col$0.35/m3 to Col$0.38/m3, and then to Col$0.50/m3
in late 1969. Following the Bank appraisal, the EPMP increased tariffs in
February 1970 at the Bank's request to Col$0.70/m3. The appraisal mission
recommended an initial rate increase to Col$1.00/m3 as a condition of
effectiven3 ss of the proposed loan, to be followed in 1971 by an increase to
Col$1.40/mi.
II.  Project Preparation and Appraisal
Origin, Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      In April 1966, a Bank project identification mission identified
the Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage Project.   In 1968, a United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) financed feasibility study of the
project was completed by a consortium of two Colombian firms and a U.S. firm.
The project was subsequently appraised by the Bank in February 1969. In May
1969, the Bank reviewed a groundwater study and public accounting audit study,
also prepared by consultants.
Negotiation and Approval
2.02      A draft appraisal report was prepared in February 1970    in which
it was stated that "adequate progress in the implementation of water supply
tariff increases in the sector as a whole should be a condition for presenta-
tion of this loan". During negotiations in April 1970 for the proposed loan
of US$2.0 million, an impasse was reached on the question of tariffs. EPMP
did not agree to implement the tariff increases recommended by the appraisal
mission. In addition, it was discovered that EPMP was in default on existing
debt service obligations with Siemens, a manufacturer of telephone equipment.
A decision was taken to suspend negotiations until such time as EPMP could
satisfactorily rectify these principal problems. During 1970, three post-
appraisal missions visited Palmira to assist the EPMP in meeting the Bank's
requirements to reopen negotiations.
2.03      In August 1970, at the suggestion of the Bank, EPMP engaged a
new consortium of engineers to review the original USAID-financed feasibility
study of 1968, upon which the appraisal was based, and to prepare designs
and bid documents. The objective of the review was to reduce the scope of
the project to keep it within the financial resources of EPMP by staging water
treatment expansion and distribution extensions and by postponing some of the
lower priority sewerage and drainage works.



- 3 -
2.04      By March 1971, increases in tariff rates to Col$0.80 had been
approved and a debt rescheduling agreement between EPMP and Siemens had been
reached. In March 1971, the Government, EPMP and the Bank jointly agreed on an
investment program based on the consultants' work. Accordingly, loan negotia-
tions were resumed on April 5, 1971, and completed on April 9, 1971. The loan
was approved on May 25, 1.971. In view of the tariff increase implemented by
EPMP and the rescheduling of EPMP's debt to Siemens, the delay in completing
loan negotiations was justified.
Project Role in Long-Term Plan
2.05      The aim of the project was to provide a nominal water treatment
capacity of 1,500 1/sec by increasing the capacity of the existing water
treatment plant from 290 1/sec to 600 1/sec and the addition of a new water
treatment plant of 900 l/sec. The project included sufficient transmission,
storage and distribution networks to meet the estimated growth in water demand
in Palmira through 1978 at service levels of almost 100%. It also included
sewage collection and drainage facilities.
Project Description
2.06      The project works as described in the appraisal report included:
(i)   Nima River intake, with a holding dam if subsequently required;
(ii)   raw water main and water treatment plant capacity of 900 1/sec;
(iii)   renovation of the existing 290 1/sec plant to expand capacity to
600 I/sec;
(iv)   two treated water storage tanks, each with a capacity of 12,000 m3;
(v)   treated water main (27") from the treatment plant to Palmira;
(vi)   extension of the water distribution system, including house
connections;
(vii)   sewerage and (drainage works; and
(viii)   consulting services for engineering and management.
2.07      It appears that: between the time of the preparation of the original
draft appraisal report and loan negotiations, the capacity of the water treat-
ment plant was reduced. The Loan Agreement, Schedule 3, indicates an expanded
capacity of 500 1/sec for the existing plant and a capacity of 400 1/sec for
the new plant for a total capacity of 900 1/sec. As noted in the previous
paragraph, the project description in the appraisal report indicated a capacity
of 1,500 1/sec.
Loan Covenants
2.08      The Loan Agreernent contained these principal covenants of which the
first two were special conditions of loan effectiveness:



-4-
(i)  EPMP to increase water tariffs to yield an average of Col$1.25/m3
of water sold;
(ii)  arrangements and terms for providing government funds to be
made and agreed to by the Bank;
(iii) maintain separate accounts and financial statements for each
service;
(iv)  have accounts and financial statements audited once each year
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and submit the
audited statements to the Bank along with the auditors' report;
(v)  maintain debt service ratio of not less than 1.5;
(vi)  funds generated from water supply and sewerage services shall
not be transferred to any of the EPMP's other services;
(vii) maintain tariffs for water supply and sewerage services suf-
ficient to earn a rate of return on revalued assets of 4% for
the years 1971-73; 6% for 1974; 7% for 1975; 8 1/2% for 1976 and
9% for 1977 and subsequent years;
(viii)  maintain tariffs for telecommunication services sufficient to
earn a rate of return of 10% for the years 1971 and 1972 and 12%
for subsequent years; and
(ix)  maintain tariffs for markets and slaughterhouses sufficient
to provide an annual operating ratio of not more than 85%.
III. Project Implementa;tion, Operation and Cost
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01      The terminal date for effectiveness of the loan was extended four
times from August 2, 1971 to December 31, 1971.    The main reasons for 3the
extensions were failure of EPMP to increase tariffs to Col$1.25 per m ;
and failure of EPMP to obtain a Col$28.0 million government loan to help
finance local project expenditures. EPMP and the Government eventually
complied with all the Bank's conditions and the loan was declared effective
on December 29, 1971.
Implementation Schedule
3.02      The project works were expected to commence with original Loan
effectiveness on August 2, 1971, and were to terminate by June 30, 1974.
The closing date for the loan was March 1, 1975.    The main elements of the
project were completed in March 1977, almost three years later than originally
scheduled. At that time, there were US$348,500 in undisbursed funds and in
February 1978 the Bank approved additional items for inclusion in the project.
The revised project was completed in June 1980. The closing date was extended
from March 1, 1975, successively to March 1, 1976, March 1, 1977, December 31,
1979, and finally to June 6, 1980.



- 5 -
3.03      The appraisal report contains a bar chart which compares actual
construction time with appraisal estimates for the project's major components
(Annex 1). Project execution of the original program was estimated at
36 months but required 66 months, or 83% longer than estimated. However,
the water treatment plant and transmission mains were completed to the
extent that they could be put into service within 45 months, thus mini-
mizing the effect of delays on EPMP's finances and on the economic viability
of the project.
3.04      The delays in the completion of the project works were due to the
following causes, as identified during the Bank's supervision missions and as
stated by the Borrower:
(i)  delay in the start of construction of the water treatment plant
due to a dispute over the contract award;
(ii)  delay in the selection of a consultant for the supervision of
construction, as a dispute arose among the three member firms
of the consultant consortium;
(iii) bad weather in 1973;
(iv)  Government red tape in obtaining import licenses;
(v)  Bank's suggested revision of the program in 1973 and the
Borrower's declination of such revisions;
(vi)  shortage of cement and other basic construction materials on
the local market;
(vii) a six-month delay in construction of the water treatment plant
due to late delivery of equipment;
(viii) delays in securing counterpart funds from the Government; and
(ix)  internal slowness in processing and awarding bids.
Since the bidding documents were ready when the loan was signed, EPMP could
have saved some time by initiating the bidding then, instead of waiting until
loan effectiveness.
Disbursement of Loan Funds
3.05      A comparison of actual with projected disbursements is presented in
Annex 2. On December 31, 1973 when the loan was expected to be fully disbursed,
actual disbursements were 25.6% of the total loan. Disbursements after com-
pletion of the original project scope in March 1977 were equivalent to 83% of
the total loan, and the final disbursement was in July 1980, 5 years and 3
months after the originally expected date. Loan disbursements equal to 38%
(US$1,210,558) of the total cost of the project were utilized for local currency
requirements, versus 36% defined in the Loan Agreement.



-6-
Procurement
3.06      All goods and services (other than the services of the consultants)
required for the project were procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under World Bank
Loans and IDA Credits, published by the Bank in August 1969 and in accordance
with the provisions set forth in Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement (Procurement).
The Borrower found no difficulty in complying with these guidelines and
procurement was accomplished in a satisfactory manner. In general, EPMP
obtained much lower bids than their consultants' estimate. With the exception
of contracts for locally manufactured cement and asbestos cement pipe, all the
equipment and material contracts went to foreign manufacturers. All the civil
works contracts were awarded to local contractors.
Revisions
3.07      In May 1973 it became apparent that EPMP's financial resources would
be inadequate to cover the originally estimated project cost of Col$77.8 million
(US$3.78 million). The Bank then recommended that the scope of the project be
reduced to be consistent with available resources. This reduction was to be
accomplished by postponing the construction of storage tanks and distribution
mains larger than 8-inch to a second stage project. All secondary distribution
network improvements (pipes up to 8 inches in diameter) remained in the project.
Furthermore, the construction period for the project was to be extended by one
year to 1975. These measures were to reduce the cost of the project by
Col$15.0 million. EPMP's response to the Bank's recommendation for reduction
in project scope was that they were opposed to any postponement and did not
understand why works should be postponed since financing was readily available
from the National Institute for Municipal Development (INSFOPAL). However,
EPMP agreed to eliminate the storage tanks from the project and to reduce the
length of the distribution main to be constructed. The financial position of
EPMP improved by April 1974 as a result of higher tariffs, improved cost
control, and of INSFOPAL    increasing its disbursements from 36% to 64% of
project expenses. As the Bank continued to disburse 36% of project costs,
debt financing was meeting 100% of direct project investments including
interest during construction.
3.08      The distribution mains and storage tanks had been designed to build
more reliability into the system and to provide distribution capacity to meet
future demands. The deletions were made in 1973 with the knowledge that they
would be needed in the future to prevent shortages during peak usage hours and
to make the system more reliable. Any reduction in the size of the treatment
and transmission facilities would have been disruptive to project implementa-
tion and would have saved little. Under the circumstances the postponement
of the deleted components was the best choice available at the time. However,
this action assumed that by project completion, EPMP's financial position
would have improved sufficiently to permit construction of the deleted
facilities to begin. Unfortunately this is not the case (para. 5.17).
3.09      In March 1977, all works programmed in the appraisal report as
modified in 1973 were completed. Of the US$2.0 million under the Loan Agreement,
US$1.642 million was disbursed. EPMP requested the Bank to finance additional



- 7 -
sewerage works from the undisbursed loan balance and this was approved by the
Bank in October 1977. Funds available were not sufficient to undertake the
water distribution mains and storage tanks deleted from the project in 1973.
In February 1978, the Loan Agreement was revised to increase the scope in Part
C, to finance construction of two sewerage interceptors (Rio Palmira, North and
South), construction of a sewer collector, and purchase of water meters and
maintenance equipment. The project as constructed is compared with the
appraised project in Annex 3. A comparison with the Loan Agreement and actual
allocation of proceeds of the loan is shown in Annex 4.
Project Costs
3.10      A comparison of the original cost estimate for the project with
the actual costs of the project is presented in Annex 5 and summarized
in the table below:
Actual Cost
Appraisal         1970      Current
Estimate         Prices     Prices
-----------Col$ Millions----------
Base Cost                69.0          40.7          99.2
Escalation                8.8             -             -
Total          77.8          40.7         99.2
3.11      In current Colombian pesos, the project had a cost overrun of 28%
which was remarkable considering the exceptionally high rates of inflation
which prevailed during the extended period of construction. A comparison of
the costs of the original project scope (para. 3.08) indicates an estimated
current cost of Col$66.2 million, which represents a current cost underrun
of 15%. In real terms (1970 Colombian pesos) the project cost underrun was
41%. The actual cost figures suggest that the original cost estimates were
overstated. This is impossible to confirm as a result of the difficulty
of comparing the project as built with the original project scope. With
respect to the treatment plant, it is probable that the appraised cost estimate
was for greater capacity expansion than was actually built (para. 2.07). If
this is the case, and given the fact that the cost of the treatment plant in
real terms was about equal to the estimated base cost, there may have been
a real cost overrun of about 25%. The real cost of the water transmission
and distribution component was lower than estimated because of overstated
appraisal cost estimates and a reduction in the length of distribution mains
installed (para. 3.07).
Financing Plan
3.12      The original financing plan for the project indicated that total
requirements of Col$100.7 million would be met by the Bank loan (41%),
Government loans (28%) and by internally generated cash (31%). Actual
total requirements are est:imated to be Col$120 million which were



- 8 -
financed by the Bank loan (Col$61 million, 51%), a Government loan through
INSFOPAL (Col$36 million, 30%) and Federal Government contributions
(Col$23 million, 19%). Internal cash generation in aggregate during the
period of project construction was not sufficient to meet debt service
requirements and did not contribute to project financing.
Reporting
3.13      The Loan Agreement did not contain specific reporting require-
ments. However, reporting requirements were set forth in a letter to
EPMP dated August 11, 1971, which contained rather detailed forms covering
the status of project implementation and EPMP operating and financial
performance which were to be submitted quarterly. EPMP never initiated
the preparation of this report and information was only obtained following
specific Bank requests or during supervision missions. Financial reports
of the Empresas Publicas Municipales de Palmira as prepared by Touche,
Ross, y Asociados Ltda. were received by the Bank for all years (1971
through 1979). No reports from the consulting engineers as to progress
or problems (other than their request for assistance in obtaining their
fees from the EPMP) are on file in the Bank.
IV. Operating Performance
Project Design and Construction
4.01      The project's principal objectives were to increase water sources,
improve water quality, provide water and sewerage services to new clients
and improve the disposal of sewage and surface water. The project was
constructed as designed, exclusive of a water storage tank (para. 2.06),
and construction was of good quality. There are no data with respect to
acceptance of performance, quality or quantity, but EPMP has stated that
the designs were appropriate and that the project facilities have achieved
their objectives in all respects. It is clear that the 1980 demand is being
satisfactorily met and that there exists reserve capacity. A comparison of
treated water quality before and after the project indicates marked improve-
ments. Physical inspection by Bank staff of the project facilities supports
EPMP's contention that the project facilities have achieved their design
objectives.
Operating Covenants
4.02      There is some uncertainty in the appraisal report with respect
to the year the water treatment facilities were to be fully utilized by
demand. The project description in the appraisal report indicates annual
treatment capacity of 47.3 million m3 (1.5 m3/sec) on completion of the
project. Based on the 8.6% water demand growth rate projected at appraisal
and an assumed unaccounted-for water level of 23%, this capacity would have
met the 1985 average demand or the 1983 maximum day demand. Maximum day
demand projections assume a maximum day to average day ratio of 1.2. As noted
previously (para. 2.07), the project description in the Loan Agreement indicates
a treatment plant capacity of 28.4 million m3 p.a. (0.9 m3/sec) on completion
of the project which would meet average demand up to 1979 or the 1977 maximum
day demand. The appraisal report, however, assumes both in its financial
projections and in the calculation of the internal rate of return, that



- 9 -
treatment facilities would be fully utilized in 1978 with production of 25.1
million m3 p.a. (0.8 m3/sec). On completion of the expansion, EPMP determined
its treatment plant capacity to be 37.8 million m3 p.a. (1.2 m3/sec). Based
on the latest demand projections, the plant has sufficient capacity to meet
the average demand until 1995 and the maximum day demand until 1991.
4.03      There were no operating performance covenants, which was appropriate
given the straightforward nature of the work and the capabilities of the
Borrower and local contra,-tors.
V.   Financial Performanc,
General
5.01      Summaries of the financial performance for EPMP consolidated and for
each division are given in Annex 6, together with financial projections from
the appraisal report. As a general statement, the financial performance was
less satisfactory than forecasted and the covenanted rates of return or
specified operating ratios were rarely achieved by any service throughout the
period of project implementation.
Consolidated Results
5.02      Selected financial data for EPMP overall for 1978 (the last
year of the appraisal pro:jections) together with the appraisal projections
for 1978 are given below:
% Increase/

a/   In current Colombian pesos.
5.03      As can be seen, while revenues were 61% higher than forecast,
operating expenses were higher by 289% and financial expenses by 391%. Despite
a net income position forecast for 1978, EPMP in fact incurred a net loss



- 10 -
equivalent to 33% of revenues. To eliminate the effects of inflation in
the 1978 comparison, the following 1978 financial data have been stated
in 1973 Colombian pesos to make them directly comparable with the appraisal
projections: 1/

5.04      The substantial revenue shortfall and operating cost increases
versus appraisal projections are still evident in the 1973 Colombian pesos
comparison and reflect principally the failure to adjust tariffs for all
services in line with appraisal expectations or to procure other resources.
Water Production and Sales
5.05      A major factor in the financial performance of EPMP's water and
sewerage operations was the volume of water produced and sold which was below
the appraisal estimate as indicated in the comparison below. Statistics for
all years 1970-1980 are given in Annex 7.

5.06      There are a number of reasons for the failure of water production
and sales to reach appraisal projection estimates. First, as shown above
the population estimate for 1970 was 15% higher than actual and the esti-
mated population growth rate of 6.0% compared with an actual growth rate
of 4.1%. As a result, the 1978 population was only 74% of the projected
population. Second, estimated water sold in 1971 was 39% higher than actual
and the number of connections was underestimated by about 10%. This resulted
in consumption per connection for appraisal purposes of about 53 m3 per month
versus 34.2 m3 actual. Third, it was assumed that consumption per connection
would increase to 64.3 m3 per month in 1978 while the actual increase was much
lower, to 38.9 m3. The appraisal report notes that per capita water demand
projections were speculative, because of the poor data available on existing
consumption. The result of the basic assumptions issued was an estimated
growth in water sales of 9.1% p.a. on an overstated base, which compared with
6.5% p.a. actual, and in 1978 water sold was only 59% of the appraisal estimate.
If the original 1970 water sold volume had been correct, the actual water sold
in 1978 would have been 82% of the appraisal estimate. Because of exception-
ally high unaccounted-for water in 1978, however, water produced was 89% of
the appraisal estimate.
5.07      It may be noted that the pattern of demand growth was irregular
because of insufficient supply capacity prior to completion of the project
water treatment facilities. Thus, between 1970 and 1975 there was no growth
in consumption despite a 28% increase in the number of connections, and
consumption per connection fell from 34.2 m3 to 25.2 m3.    The degree of
suppressed demand is indicated by the increase in consumption per connection
to 35.7 m3 and an increase in water sales of 50% when the treatment plant
capacity was expanded in 1976.
Water and Sewerage Tariffs
5.08      Water and sewerage tariffs are progressive, allowing a minimum
consumption of 25 m3 per month for the lowest category. In 1980 the average
revenue per m3 was in Co'l$3.70. The minimum monthly charge per connection
was Col$25.00 which allowed a consumption of 25 m3 per month. In comparison,
Cali, a city with a popuLation of 1,000,000 just 30 km from Palmira, has an
average tariff of Col$11.00 per m3. However, the same minimum monthly charge
per connection is charged. In Palmira average tariffs were low during most of
the project period. Annual average tariffs charged from 1970-79 are listed in
the following table in both current prices and 1973 prices:

Current            1973

1970                       0.50             0.78
1971                       0.80             1.11
1972                       1.40             1.71
1973                       2.00             2.00
1974                       2.00             1.60
1975                       2.50             1.62
1976                       2.50             1.35
1977                       3.00             1.20
1978                       3.00             1.03
1979                       3.70             1.02
From the above figures, it can be seen that tariffs have not kept up with
inflation and that in real terms, tariffs are lower than those assumed for
the appraisal financial projections (Col$1.50 per m3 in 1973 prices).
Unaccounted-for Water
5.09      At the time of appraisal unaccounted-for water was estimated to be
30% of water produced, and the expectation was that this would be reduced to
23% by 1978. Historical data which first came to the attention of the Bank
during the March 1973 mission now indicate that the actual unaccounted-for
water in 1970 was 45%. Between then and 1978 the percentage of unaccounted-for
water ranged between 41% and 53%. It is probable that part of the apparent
losses was an overestimate of water produced. Prior to the construction of
the new water treatment plant, production metering was inadequate as evidenced
by the relationship between production and consumption. For example, in 1974
water sold increased by almost 1.0 million m3 from the previous year, and
water produced declined by 0.8 million m3. Reliability of production metering
was improved with the project. Since 1975 production has been measured with
a venturi meter with a recorder, a type of meter which is considered to be
very reliable.
5.10      Increased consumer metering did not appear to be effective in
reducing unaccounted-for water early in the project. In 1970 85% of connec-
tions were metered (with many non-functioning) and by 1975 the system was
100% metered (most were functioning). During the period of new meter instal-
lation and repair, between 1970 and 1975, the volume of water sold actually
decreased while reported water produced remained constant, thereby resulting
in a 49% level of unaccounted-for water in 1975 versus 45% in 1970. However,
better results were obtained later in the project. Between 1975 and 1978
no new meters were installed and by 1978, the number of services with func-
tioning meters had declined to 80%. By mid-1979 all broken meters had been
repaired and meters had been placed on all connections installed since 1975
without meters, so that the metering level was again 100%. This effort was
made possible by the use of loan funds to purchase spare parts and meters.
Enough meters and parts were purchased this time to allow EPMP to maintain
the level of metering close to 100%. As a result, in 1980 unaccounted-for
water was only 29% of production.

Water Supply and Sewerage
5.11      The financial results of the water supply and sewerage division
for 1978 are compared with appraisal estimates in the following table:
Actual
% Increase/
(Decrease) vs.
Appraisal    Actual        Appraisal

Net Income/(Loss)               7.5       (2.8)       (137)
a/   1973 Colombian pesos.
5.12      Operating revenues were at 50% of projected levels as a result of
water sales being 41% below expectations (para. 5.05) and because of lower-
than forecasted tariff levels. In 1973 Colombian pesos, 1978 average revenue
per m3 of water sold was Col$1.28 versus the appraisal projection of Col$1.50.
Conversely, operating expenses in 1973 Colombian pesos per m3 of water sold were
Col$0.98 in 1978 compared with Col$0.40 forecasted at the time of appraisal.
Other Services
5.13      A summary of 1973 financial results for EPMP's other services in
comparison with appraisal expectations is presented below:
Telephones                     Markets/Slaughterhouse

a/   1973 Colombian pesos.
5.14      For telephones, public markets and the slaughterhouse operations
tariffs in real terms were below, and costs above expectations. The result
was substantial losses in 1.978 for all services versus forecasted profitable
operations.



- 14 -
Financial Covenants
5.15      As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the borrowers' compliance
with the financial covenants (para. 2.07) was poor. The situation in 1978, the
last year of the appraisal projections, and in 1979 is summarized below:
Actual
Requirement              1978             1979
Water and Sewerage      9% Return                       2.0%              0.0%
Telephones              12% Return                      6.0%              9.0%
Markets                 0.85 Operating Ratio            2.91              3.02
Slaughterhouses         0.85 Operating Ratio            1.50              1.60
5.16      Compliance with the financial covenants in each service would have
resulted in much improved financial performance and reduced or eliminated the
requirements for Government contributions to support operations. The reason
why tariffs for all services failed to be increased on the surface appears to
be political, but the Municipal Council's reluctance to raise charges commen-
surately with costs reflects the perception that the low family incomes which
prevail in Palmira are too low to permit full cost recovery. Whether or not
incomes are really low compared to other areas in Colombia is not known since
no statistics on income levels in Palmira are available. With respect to
water supply, there are virtually no wealthy residential consumers or large
commercial and industrial consumers which through progressive tariffs could
subsidize the low income consumers. Telephone tariffs were satisfactory until
1978 when a large debt service burden commenced. In 1980 they were reinstated to
appropriate levels. Market and slaughterhouse rates appear to be kept low as
a way to subsidize food prices and small business in the case of markets.
Future Finances
5.17      At the present time, EPMP remains in a difficult financial position
even though tariff increases for all services have been or were expected to be
made in 1980. After payment of a heavy debt service burden, the Borrower will
have no funds to construct the distribution improvements which were deleted
from the project in 1973 (para. 3.08) in order to solve the financial problems
then facing EPMP.
VI. Institutional Performance and Development
6.01      The appraisal report noted the adequacy of EPMP's organizational
structure which basically remained unchanged throughout the period of
project execution. The General Manager nominated for a two-year period
in January 1971 was considered capable. It was recommended that management
assistance be provided to correct deficiencies in accounting, billing and
financial planning.



- 15 -
6.02      Since 1971, EPMP has had three new general managers of which only
one, who held office in 1972-73, lacked adequate qualifications. The institu-
tional technical assistance provided for in the project was implemented in
1972 by a team of PAHO consultants, and the report and recommendations provided
the basis for a number of procedural changes in the financial and commercial
operations of EPMP. The changes in the General Manager position were less
frequent than is typical in Colombia, and it appears that the relative
stability of management and its dedication to service have steadily improved
the operations of EPMP. The incumbent General Manager has held his position
since January 1977, and at. present EPMP is a capably managed public utility.
Because of low pay scales and the small city environment, however, the turnover
of qualified professional staff has been high.
VII. Economic Re-evaluation
7.01      The internal financial rate of return on the project was calculated
on an incremental basis which attributed all of EPMP's projected operating
income before depreciation above the level which prevailed in 1970 to the
project. The result was a. calculated internal financial rate of return on the
project of 19.9% which is grossly overstated since only the incremental income
should have been attributed to the project. To eliminate this overstatement,
the internal financial rate of return has been recalculated using appraisal
data but calculating benef'its by multiplying the incremental sales volume
expected to be generated by the project times the projected operating income
before depreciation per m3 sold. The recalculated rate of return on the
project is 9.8% (Annex 8). The ex-post calculation of internal rate of return
based on actual incremental sales volume and actual tariffs (all values stated
in real terms) results in a return of 0.4%. The much lower return is explained
both by lower incremental sales volume and lower real tariffs which in 1978 were
53% and 42% lower,respectively, than appraisal report projections.
7.02      Had the project been completed in accordance with the appraisal
schedule, revenues would have been an estimated 13% higher in 1974 and 40%
higher in 1975, producing an increase in net income equal to Col$6.0 million
(current). This amount assumes no increase in tariffs. The earlier avail-
ability of water may have had a greater impact by making it possible to raise
tariffs as a result of the improved service.    Whereas the additional revenue
would have been helpful, it would not have compensated for inadequate tariffs
which was and continues to be the cause of EPMP's financial problems.
7.03      The project's rate of return would have improved with an
on-schedule completion, but not significantly. With a three year implementa-
tion period, the rate of return would have been 0.5% instead of 0.4%.
VIII. Project Justification
8.01      The project was originally designed in 1969 to produce potable
water for Palmira's increasing population. It was successful in doing
this as at present an estimated 98% of Palmira's population is served with



- 16 -
water, compared with 94% in 1970. Water demand in 1978, which was the design
year for the facilities, proved to be about 60% of that forecasted at the time
of appraisal (para. 5.05). As a result of a reduction of unaccounted-for
water from 49% in 1978 to about 30% currently, and a lower rate in demand growth
than expected, supply and treatment facilities can now be expected to meet 100%
of the demand through 1991. However, the distribution improvements deleted
from the project may be required to adequately distribute the available supply
prior to this date (para. 3.07).
8.02      A water supply project in Palmira was necessary, even at lower-
than-predicted water consumption growth, as the existing treatment plant
was inadequate (in terms of both quantity and quality), system water losses
were high (45%), deliveries to about one-fourth of Palmira's customers were
unmetered, the distribution system was in need of repairs, and pollution from
sewage had to be reduced. The project represented a major step towards
satisfying these needs. The project also was successful in improving EPMP's
institutional performance (para. 9.02), but did not achieve the objectives of
improving financial performance (para. 5.01) or the expected internal rate of
return in the project (para. 7.01).
IX. Bank Performance
Appraisal Issues
9.01      There were no major issues raised during appraisal other than the
tariff rates. EPMP was considered to be a fairly well managed utility which
needed no more than the typical institutional covenants. The project was
considered to be satisfactorily prepared by both the Bank and EPMP. Demand
projections which were not an issue proved to be grossly overestimated
because of an inadequate data base and the assumption of optimistic
growth rate (para. 5.07). Also, more time should have been allowed for
delays in the estimate of time required for project completion.
Loan Supervision
9.02      Because of financial difficulties which became apparent in 1972,
the project was regularly supervised. From the time of the loan effectiveness
on December 29, 1971 to the completion of project in June 1980, there were a
total of 22 supervision missions (Annex 9). It should be noted that visits
to Palmira were typically of 1-2 days?duration which were made during longer
missions for projects in Bogota and Cali. The visits were followed by mission
reports highlighting deficiencies and by letters and discussions with EPMP's
management and municipal and national government officials urging that correc-
tive actions be initiated where required. Suggested actions covered all
aspects of the project: management, personnel practices, construction,
finances, procurement, engineering, tariffs and others. The advice and
pressure was instrumental in improving operations, but was not successful in
obtaining timely tariff increases which were needed to improve EPMP's financial
situation. Atno time did the Bank considered suspension of disbursements or
modifying the covenanted requirements.



- 17 -
Borrower's Opinion
9.03       The Borrower is pleased with the results of the project and with
the performance of the Bank during project supervision. A statement of the
present General Manager regarding the project is given in Annex 10 and the
comments with respect to the role of the Bank are presented below: "As
a source of financing for the external component, the World Bank has
had a positive impact on the meeting of the technical standards set
for the project and also in the formulation of a set of recommendations
for the Authority's administrative and financial management which
created the essential groundwork for achievement of the proposed objec-
tives. Disbursements were made on time and the information on account
status and repayment mechanisms was very clear. Further, the comments
on the financial statements influenced the decision taken by the Manage-
ment and Board regarding expenditures and tariffs, while the procedures
for contract award were such that the interests of the Authority and
the return on available resources were protected. We also have to
acknowledge the contribution of Bank officials who visited the Authority
and who always showed a desire to help and to understand the technical
financial, administrative and political difficulties with which we had
to contend."
X. Conclusions and Lessons Learned
General
10.01     The project was successful in expanding EPMP's water production
and treatment capacity and improving sanitary conditions in parts of the
city. At the completion of the project, almost 100% of the population of
Palmira was served with potable water. However, if the full benefits of the
project are to be realized in the future, the distribution mains and storage
tanks deleted from the project in 1973 must now be constructed. Unfortunately,
EPMP's financial performance did not improve as a result of the project.
Technical
10.02     Technical execution of the project fell short of expectations
in that implementation took longer than estimated by the appraisal team
(paras. 3.03 and 3.04). Work on the various project components began
12 to 48 months after appraisal estimates. The problem was with initiation
of the works. Once the work began, the various components were completed
within appraisal estimates. While these delays had little effect on the
project's internal financial rate of return, the impact they had on nominal
construction costs was substantial. As a result the project scope had to be
reduced (para. 3.07). Revenues were affected to a lesser extent. Had the
project been completed on schedule, the cumulative additional net income
realized from the project    would have been only Col$6.0 million (current
pesos).



- 18 -
10.03     The regularity with which delays occur in practically
all Bank projects suggests that a more careful analysis of project execution
time by Bank appraisal teams is required. Perhaps it is time that the Bank
face up the fact that the projects in developing countries are going to
take longer to implement than is the case in developed countries. In the
past, appraisal implementation schedules have served more as targets, rather
than realistic schedules. Bank appraisals should continue to estimate comple-
tion times under realistic conditions. However, the appraisal could also
determine the effect of delayed implementation on the following aspects of
the project: (a) current project costs; (b) internal rate of return; and
(c) revenues. A contingency plan could also be proposed for overcoming the
adverse effects of delays, such as increasing the project cost contingencies
or designating certain project components to be eliminated from the project,
if not initiated by a certain date, so that costs do not escalate beyond the
financial resources of the implementing agency.
10.04     The time required for the loan to become effective was also
underestimated by the Bank. In retrospect, the 69 days allowed initially
to put in place a tariff increase and obtain additional financing was too
short. On the other hand, the 218 days it actually took was excessive.
The period allowed or effectiveness should be based on a realistic assessment
of the time required to meet the conditions. Also, as a way of saving time,
the borrower should have been encouraged to proceed with bidding immediately
after loan signing, indicating in the bidding documents that the contract
award would be contingent on loan effectiveness.
10.05     The problem of overestimation of demand has plagued all of the
Bank's water supply projects in Colombia during the past decade. The result
has been that a number of projects have been oversized, thus making scarce
resources unavailable to others who are in need and making it difficult for
the owners of the oversized projects to pay for them. The Palmira project is
a typical example. It is good banking practice to alert a borrower that he is
overextending himself and even to decline lending beyond prudent limits of the
Borrower's capacity. In the case of the development banks, this is more than
a good practice. It should be a duty. The lesson learned from this project
is that more care must be taken with the preparation of demand projections.
Projections which simply extend past trends are not good enough. Social,
economic and geographical factors must also be taken into account. Where the
factors affecting future growth are not clear, the low and high estimates
of demand should be prepared along with a sensitivity analysis of project
cost to demand growth rate.
Financial
10.06     EPMP's financial performance did not improve as a result of the
project, even though there were clearly defined financial criteria for
each service and constant pressure by the Bank to meet these criteria.
As a consequence, EPMP does not now have the financial resources to under-
take the works that were postponed which are now necessary to realize
the full benefits of the project as originally conceived. EPMP's reluctance
to raise tariffs seemed based on the fact previously noted that almost
the entire population has low incomes and there are few industrial and



- 19 -
commercial customers, whLch could facilitate any cross-subsidization
between high-income and Low-income consumers.   However, it is likely that
the consumers in Palmira would have been willing to pay for high service
standards if EPMP had pul: to them the alternative of lower service levels.
Bank Management of t:he Project
10.07     Part of the responsibility for the failure of the project to meet
its financial objectives was the Bank's leniency in dealing with EPMP's
failure to comply with the loan covenants. The project files do not show
any record that enforcement of Bank remedies or modification of the covenants
were considered as possible avenues for bringing EPMP into compliance. In
retrospect, the Bank should have been more forceful. Bank pressure can be a
useful tool for the managers of water utilities to overcome low tariff policies
forced on them politically.

PALMIRA WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Stat.ement of the General Manager of
EMPRESAS PUBLICAS MUNICIPALES DE PALMIRA
Empresas Plblieas Municipales de Palmira (P-lmira Municipal Utilities
Authority) is most satisfied that the first phase of the ms ter water supply
and severage plan has been completed and turned over to the city. This marks
a major milestone for the authority inasmuch as the plan vas designed not
only to overcome current deficiencies in service but to meet the needs resulting
from expansion over the niext 20 years.
Palmira now has a i3olid infrastructure of basic services which will
undergird the-eity's nornal growth under optimal sanitation eonditions. Its
utilities have an adfinilstrative and technical organization capable of respond-
ing to the day-to-day finiancial requirements and needs for proper operation
and maintenance of the nwLter supply, severage, telephone, slaughterhouse and
marketplace systems.
The investments in all phases of service, from the Rio Nina catchment
area to the Rio Palsira %rhere the sevage is intercepted, were influenced by
the recommendations made by the consultants, the supervisory authorities and
the World Bank, all of whom played no small role in the success of the plan.

The project nevertheless encountered serious difficulties which
prevented it from being completed within the original timetable and cost
estimates. These were in brief:
(1) Difficulties in obtaining import permits for equipment.
(2) Scarcity in the domestic market of certain basic materials
such as cement, iron and pipe.
(3) Non-performance on the part of equipment and materials suppliers.
(4) Underestimating in the calculation of certain conponents of the
civil works.
(5) The tine taken over the bidding and award procedures by the
Authority's Board.
(6) Difficulty in generating the internal component, which was greatly
aggravated by the delay in executing the project and the high
inflation rates in recent years.
A source of financing for the external component, the World Bank has
had a positive impact on the meeting of the technical standards set for the
project and also in the formulation of a set of recomeudations for the
Authority's administrative and financial mAnagement which created the essential
groundwork for achievement of the proposed objectives. Disbursements were
made on time and the information on account status and repayment mechanisms vas
very clear. Further, the comments on the financial statements influenced the
decision taken by the Management and Board regarding expenditures and tariffs,
while the procedures for coabract award were such that the interests of the
Authority and the return on available resources were protected.
We also have to acknowledge the contribution of Bank officials who
visited the Authority and who always shoved a desire to help and to understand

technical, financial, ELdinistrative and political difficulties we had
to contend with.
The social benefit from the master water supply and sewerage plan
is difficult to quantify, but will be seen in the expansion of these
servicee to 98% of the population, lover morbidity and mortality rates
from water-borne diseasies and the stimulus to harmonious comercial,
industrial and housing grovth without the shock of squatter settlements,
slums and other signs of social unconformity.
Nevertheless, we should note that we have merely reached the end of
the first phase of the construction of the proposed works for whieh an
estimated 30 years will be needed altogether. We now have to seek the
sources of internal and. external financing for installation of the combined
storm and sanitary sewerage systems planned for the future, construction of
a sewage treatment plant and expansion of the line systems, costing more
than US$20 million, for which we hope to obtain funds on terms and
conditions compatible with slow and difficult recovery and the effort made
by a city to improve the living conditions it offers.

COMMENTS FROM GOVERNMENT
Translation of incoming telex
Bogota, May 16, 1983                            455
Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
Director
Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
Washington, D.C.
Subject: Completion Reports on Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(IBRD Loan 738-Co) and Second Atlantico Development Project
(IBRD Loan 849-co)
Dear Mr. Kapur:
I am pleased to inform you that the referenced documents can generally
be said to present the essential conditions that prevailed during execution of
the projects in question; as a result, I regard these documents as satisfactory
and not in need of any amendment.
Despite the foregoing, and with a view to improving the executionfof
future projects, I feel that it is important to bear in mind the conclusions
of the reports, namely that conditions, goals, period of execution, adminis-
tration and evaluation be made more realistic by employing more pragmatic
assumptions. As a consequence, the National Government is prepared to extend
to the Bank whatever assistance it requires to ensure better execution of future
projects and so secure increased social benefits for the regions in question.
Finally, I feel that the greatest importance should be attached to comments
in this regard by the project executing agencies, as they are the bodies best
placed to assess the results, both technical and financial, of the projects and
the lessons to be drawn from them.
Regards,
Jorge Serpa Erazo
Director General of Public Credit
Ministry of Finance
